When expressed in Escherichia coli, these clones can elicit bioluminescence that is readily visible. The clones code for luciferases of four types, distinguished by the colors of bioluminescence they catalyze: green (546 nanometers), yellow-green (560 nanometers), yellow (578 nanometers), and orange (593 nanometers). The amino acid sequences of the different luciferases are 95 to 99 percent identical with each other, but are only 48 percent identical with the sequence of firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis). Because of the different colors, these clones may be useful in experiments in which multiple reporter genes are needed.\r"

The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene is amplified in 25 to 30 percent of human primary breast cancers and this alteration is associated with disease behavior. In this report, several similarities were found in the biology of HER-2/neu in breast and ovarian cancer, including a similar incidence of amplification, a direct correlation between amplification and over-expression, evidence of tumors in which overexpression occurs without amplification, and the association between gene alteration and clinical outcome. A comprehensive study of the gene and its products (RNA and protein) was simultaneously performed on a large number of both tumor types. This analysis identified several potential shortcomings of the various methods used to evaluate HER-2/neu in these diseases (Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) and provided information regarding considerations that should be addressed when studying a gene or gene product in human tissue. The data presented further support the concept that the HER-2/neu gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human cancers.\r"

On renal angiography, 16 patients had nephrogram as evidence of collateral circulation. Seven patients had no renal perfusion. There was no significant difference in renal function, blood pressure, or survival after renal reperfusion in patients with or without nephrogram. In patients who received vascular grafts, the postoperative serum creatinine level and blood pressure were significantly lower than those of patients who had thromboendarterectomy (P less than .05). In contradistinction to commonly held concepts, these findings are independent of collateral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Some of the basic underlying processes in the development of diabetic retinopathy include changes in the walls of retinal vessels, with occlusion and leakage. These result in edema, hemorrhage, hard exudates, plaques, and ischemia, leading to neovascularization. When proliferative retinopathy supervenes, it may result in complete blindness. Internists and family practice physicians should be alert for early signs of diabetic retinopathy. Ideally, diabetic patients should have their eyes examined yearly by an ophthalmologist. A fundus examination without dilation and usually without acuity testing rarely detects proliferative or early background retinopathy. Multicenter studies have shown that photocoagulation of new vessels with the argon laser may significantly reduce the incidence of severe visual loss. This treatment method has the potential of reducing the incidence of diabetic blindness by 60% to 80%. Photocoagulation is not a \"cure\" for diabetic macular edema; when used judiciously, however, it can sometimes further reduce visual loss caused by this common disease. The course of diabetic retinopathy in individual cases is unpredictable. After photocoagulation, some patients cannot see as well as before, though in others the progress of the disease is arrested. There is a conservative concern about a procedure that destroys retinal tissue in the hope of limiting the progression of the disorder. Yet photocoagulation appears to be the only alternative until a better treatment is developed through basic research.\r"

Systemic and pulmonary circulations exhibit differences that limit the usefulness of COP manipulation in the treatment of pulmonary edema, especially that associated with hypoxic damage or pulmonary contusion. Systemic transcapillary fluid transport, however, is governed significantly by COP, and serial measurements of COP can serve as useful guides for colloid replacement. In this paper we present instances in which COP determinations were found to be clinically helpful, and discuss colloid replacement during surgery.\r"

Intraoperative real-time sonography was used for monitoring retropulsed fragments during distraction and fracture impaction. Computed tomography was used to compare preoperative canal compromise and postoperative reduction. Average canal compromise preoperatively was 66.5%, and the average canal compromise postoperatively was 18.7%. Neurologic function was not changed in 16, improved in ten, and worsened in none. Average hospital stay was 21.6 days. No complications were directly attributable to the use of the ultrasound.

The purpose of this article is to present a new surgical technique and clinical results of 13 patients with symptomatic spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis who were treated with tension band wiring (intra- or intersegmental) and bone grafting techniques. This article also presents the results of biomechanical effects of these tension band wiring methods on canine lumbar spines with experimental spondylolytic defects. Thirteen adult patients, three with spondylolysis, and ten with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, were treated with intrasegmental or intersegmental wiring with bone grafting technique, and the clinical results were evaluated at the mean follow-up period of 20 months. Patients with spondylolysis were treated with intrasegmental wiring (transverse processes to the spinous process of the same segment) with bone grafting at the lytic defect. Patients with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis were treated with intersegmental wiring (transverse process of the segment with defect to the spinous process of the same segment and to the spinous process of the segment below) with bone grafting to the defect and one-level fusion. All 13 patients had a solid spinal fusion and/or healing of the defect at the follow-up evaluation. Eleven had excellent clinical results; one a good, and one a fair result. The results of the biomechanical study showed that the experimental spondylolytic defect produced a significant decrease in bending stiffness (flexion-extension), and the wiring techniques (both the intra- and intersegment) increased the bending stiffness to that of the normal intact spinal segment.\r"

Measurements were made preoperatively and at 6-week intervals postoperatively. The data for the first 12 months postoperatively are reported here. In all patients there was at first a consistent loss in density in the vertebrae above the fusion mass, averaging 15.7%. This was followed by a gradual density increase such that by 1 year postoperatively, in 60% of the subjects, the density of these vertebrae was higher than the preoperative level. In the grafted areas, bone changes were cyclical, demonstrating a remodeling pattern consistent with that described in animal literature for graft healing and also consistent with modern bone remodeling theory. There was a general tendency toward a gradual increase in the density of the fusion mass.\r"

  ".W": "Therapeutic use of contact lenses is an essential element in ophthalmic care. Materials currently in use include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), cellulose acetate butyrate, siloxane-containing polymethacrylates, silicones, and hydrogels. Suitability of a material for therapeutic contact lens use is determined by the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties (notably gas permeability and hydrophilicity, but also lipid absorption and lens movement, among others) and the condition to be treated; fabrication techniques are likewise important, affecting lens diameter and base curve. Selection and fitting of therapeutic contact lenses requires knowledge of how different contact lenses affect corneal physiology, as well as an understanding of the mechanisms whereby a contact lens can be therapeutic. In addition to these topics, general fitting guidelines are discussed, and results of therapeutic lens use in selected clinical situations (including recurrent erosion, metaherpetic ulcers and other epithelial defects, and keratitis sicca, and other dry eye states). Common therapeutic contact lens complications and their treatment are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic open-angle glaucoma is a disease in which characteristic changes occur in optic nerve morphology and in ganglion cell function. The utility of intraocular pressure readings in the diagnosis and ongoing management of glaucoma patients is pragmatically considered in the light of the availability of potentially more sensitive means of glaucoma monitoring. Conservative appraisal of the literature suggests that traditional clinical tonometry has low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The majority of new cases of glaucomatous visual field loss are most likely to arise from the normotensive population. Clinical studies to determine the correlation between intraocular pressure reduction and the preservation of visual function have repeatedly yielded a much weaker association between these two variables than is perhaps generally assumed. Newer psychophysical methods may have greater potential for rapidly identifying and subsequently monitoring glaucoma patients, but still require refinement and more widespread clinical evaluation. One prerequisite for the eventual adoption of such methods is that clinicians fully appreciate the limitations inherent in tonometry as a glaucoma screening and monitoring technique.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic glaucoma has been thought to spare the central vision until quite late in the disease process. This assumption is based on the use of the relatively insensitive Snellen chart to measure central vision and the relatively sensitive kinetic and static perimetry to measure the peripheral vision. In recent years, new measures of visual function have been utilized to assess patients with glaucomatous damage. Sensitive methods of measuring central visual function such as color vision, contrast sensitivity (both spatial and temporal), and macular light sensitivity have demonstrated defects early in the glaucomatous process - sometimes even before perimetry is affected. Since these visual functions are largely mediated by macular fibers, central vision may be affected earlier and more frequently in glaucoma than previously believed. Studies of both the nerve fiber layer of the retina and of quantitative light sense perimetry suggest that glaucomatous damage may occur diffusely across the population of nerve fibers, focally in the arcuate portion of the nerve fiber layer, or in both places. Color vision, contrast sensitivity and macular light sense appear to correlate with the diffuse type of nerve fiber layer damage. The exact utility of the psychophysical tests that assess central visual function for the clinical management of glaucoma has not yet been demonstrated. More work is needed to determine which tests are most useful, what parameters are most efficient, and what the diagnostic and prognostic significance of abnormal values may be. However, the studies of color vision, contrast sensitivity and macular light sensitivity have led to a better understanding of how glaucoma affects visual function.\r"

The anatomy of the nerve fiber layer and its retinotopic projections to the optic nerve head form the basis of the spatial relationships between structure and function in glaucoma. Clinical experience with the temporal correlations of structure and function indicates that visible alterations of the optic nerve and surrounding nerve fiber layer may occur before scotomas in the visual field can be detected. Quantitative clinical studies of the optic nerve and visual field support this concept, and provide additional clues regarding the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic nerve damage.\r"

The mean age of the treated patients (four men, five women) was 63.7 years and of the control patients (seven men, three women) 64.4 years. Most infarctions were in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. One treated patient died of sudden cardiac death on Day 12; one control patient died of cerebral herniation. Two treated patients had episodes of clinically insignificant hypotension during Day 1 of treatment. Two control patients had myocardial infarctions during the trial. The mean Toronto Stroke Scale scores at stroke onset were 67 and 90 and at Week 12 were 22.5 and 34.7 in the treated and control groups, respectively. There was parallel improvement in the two groups, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.12). The mean Barthel Index functional scores at stroke onset were 32.8 and 33 and at Week 12 were 90 and 78.8 in the treated and control groups, respectively. There was a trend in favor of the treated group, but differences between groups did not reach significance.

False-positive results were detected in eight patients, for an overall accuracy of 86%. Among a group of 25 patients with acute cerebral or ocular events ipsilateral to an apparently occluded artery, false-positive results occurred in seven (accuracy of 72%). Among a group of 33 patients with asymptomatic or remotely symptomatic apparent occlusions, only one false-positive occurred, for an accuracy of 97%. This difference in accuracy between groups was significant. Thus, a Doppler/ultrasound diagnosis of occlusion was most inexact in those patients for whom the detection of continued patency was most likely to influence management.\r"

Forebrain ischemia was induced in fed rats by combining controlled systemic hypotension with bilateral carotid artery clamping for 10 1/2 minutes. Following clamp release, one group of six rats [corrected] was given insulin (2 IU/kg s.c. b.i.d.) for 1 week. An ischemic-control group of five rats [corrected] received no postischemic treatment. A sham-ischemia group of rats was used as a behavioral control. Throughout the recovery period until sacrifice, the drinking water of all rats was supplemented with 25% glucose. Rats were trained on two water maze place navigation tasks 1-2 months after ischemia. Escape latencies and swim patterns were recorded. Performance in the insulin-treated group was better than that in the ischemic-control group (p less than 0.05) on both tasks and did not differ significantly from that of the sham-ischemia group. Improvement in behavior correlated with a significant reduction in CA1 hippocampal necrosis in the insulin-treated group (p less than 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that postischemic treatment with insulin improves neurobehavioral performance in addition to lessening ischemic neuronal necrosis.\r"

The distal occlusive flow pattern on DCS corresponds to internal carotid artery occlusion at the siphon angiographically, the median flow pattern on DCS corresponds to partial recanalization, and a normal flow pattern on DCS indicates almost complete recanalization. Since DCS can be easily repeated, the exact time of recanalization can be determined noninvasively. In all three patients, hemorrhagic infarction observed on computed tomograms occurred at the time of recanalization detected by DCS. DCS demonstrates that recanalization is one of the mechanisms of hemorrhagic infarction.\r"

Appropriate sizes of such donor pools were evaluated theoretically in the Japanese population and in European and North American whites. To enable more than 80 percent of patients to have at least one identical donor, only 50,000 potential donors would be necessary for Japanese persons, whereas 1,000,000 and 400,000, respectively, would be required for European and North American whites.\r"

However, only 30 percent of those patients who need a bone marrow transplant have a matched sibling donor. Programs have been developed to provide volunteer unrelated bone marrow donors for patients without sibling donors. Because bone marrow donation requires a high level of altruism, especially on the part of a donor unrelated to the patient, it is important to determine the effect of donation on the donor. Serious medical complications during the collection of marrow from related donors have been reported only rarely, but there have been no reports on the psychosocial and physical effects of the bone marrow donation process on volunteer unrelated bone marrow donors. The first 20 unrelated volunteers who donated bone marrow through the authors' volunteer bone marrow donor program were surveyed. They suffered no serious emotional or physical aftereffects. Seventeen of 20 donors reported that making the decision to donate was easy, and 16 reported making the decision to donate right away. Nine of 20 donors, however, stated that a friend or family member discouraged them from donating. All 20 donors thought that they were well prepared for the donation process. Four donors thought that the donation process required more time than they expected, but four donors thought the reverse. One person thought the process was more painful than they expected; however, 12 found the process to be less painful than expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven patients were treated with PBSCs and 19 with marrow. Five to nine collections of PBSC were performed per patient. There was a rebound increase in circulating committed progenitors when PBSC were collected during the marrow rebound after cyclic chemotherapy. After intensification and cellular rescue, quicker recovery of circulating white cells (p less than 0.05) and a shorter hospital stay (not significant) were seen in the PBSC patients than in those treated with autologous marrow. There was no difference in the duration of red cell or platelet transfusion required after transplant. Of six patients whose marrows were previously involved by Hodgkin's, recurrent or progressive disease has occurred in five. PBSC may be a viable alternative to marrow in selected patients.\r"

The onset of symptoms occurs early in therapy, usually within the first six weeks. Presenting symptoms often include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, anorexia, and myalgias or arthralgias. Other significant findings that may develop throughout hospitalization are jaundice, periorbital or facial edema, and splenomegaly. The following alterations in liver function tests are associated with phenytoin hepatotoxicity: elevations in serum aminotransferases, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Rechallenges, lymphocyte stimulation test, and liver biopsy have been used to aid in the diagnosis. Rechallenge is the most definitive diagnostic approach; however, its use is limited by the potential of a fatal reaction. Although the exact mechanism of phenytoin hepatotoxicity is unknown, the majority of literature supports a hypersensitivity mechanism. The severity of this adverse effect ranges from self-limiting to fatal. Since 1965 six fatal cases have been reported. To date, sufficient evidence is not available to establish treatment guidelines. Discontinuation of phenytoin therapy is warranted.\r"

SPECT is more widely available than positron emission tomography, and complements anatomic visualization with X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Iofetamine is an amphetamine analog that is rapidly taken up by the lungs, then redistributed principally to the liver and brain. The precise mechanism of localization has not been determined, but is believed to result from nonspecific receptor binding. Brain uptake peaks at 30 minutes postinjection and remains relatively constant through 60 minutes. The drug is metabolized and excreted in the urine, with negligible activity remaining at 48 hours. When compared with CT in stroke patients, visualization may be performed sooner after symptom onset and a larger zone of involvement may be evident with iofetamine. Localization of seizure foci and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease may also be possible. As CT has revolutionized noninvasive imaging of brain anatomy, SPECT with iofetamine permits routine cerebral blood flow imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. Ganciclovir is an acyclic deoxyguanosine analog structurally similar to acyclovir but with superior activity against CMV. The median ganciclovir concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50 percent is 2.15 mumol versus 72 mumol for acyclovir. Pharmacokinetic properties of ganciclovir include biexponential decay with a terminal half-life of 2.5 hours, tissue uptake, cerebrospinal fluid penetration, and renal dependence for elimination. CMV treatment approaches have commonly used dosages of 3-15 mg/kg/d. In uncontrolled trials, the response rate of CMV retinitis is approximately 80 percent. The overall response rate for CMV pneumonitis has been approximately 50 percent. However, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and other immunosuppressed patients appear to respond more favorably (approximately 70 percent) than do marrow transplant recipients. Relapse is common once ganciclovir is stopped and maintenance therapy may be required for sustained benefit. Neutropenia appears to be the drug-limiting adverse reaction. Although the development of ganciclovir-resistant CMV, risk factors for neutropenia, and alternative administration strategies all need further study, ganciclovir appears to have a role in the treatment of cytomegalovirus disease.\r"

  ".W": "The practice of therapeutic substitution, i.e., replacing one drug with another chemically different drug from the same therapeutic class, represents an important therapeutic modification with potential clinical significance far beyond that of generic substitution. Adverse consequences following therapeutic substitution of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) is of special concern because of substantial differences among these agents in pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and clinical properties. Therapeutic substitution of NSAID for ambulatory patients may result in compromised clinical outcome because (1) patient response is unpredictable and selection of the optimal agent must be tailored for each patient; (2) substantial differences exist in adverse reaction profiles; (3) drug interaction studies are lacking; and (4) selection of an agent must be individualized to ensure compliance with the dosing regimen. Cost savings achieved through therapeutic substitution of NSAID may be lost by additional overall treatment costs due to adverse reactions or suboptimal therapy. The occurrence of adverse or suboptimal effects in ambulatory patients is more likely if NSAID are substituted without full knowledge of the patient's medical history and clinical status. Communication between the pharmacy and prescribing physician regarding a patient's specific needs is essential for rational substitution among NSAID.\r"

Propafenone also possesses weak beta- and calcium-channel blocking properties. The bioavailability of propafenone is dose-dependent. Hepatic metabolism of this agent is polymorphic and appears to correlate with the ability of the liver to oxidize debrisoquin sulfate. Propafenone is effective in suppressing spontaneous ventricular ectopy; however, the drug may be less effective in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation when evaluated using programmed stimulation. Propafenone is also useful in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias including atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. Adverse reactions seen with propafenone affect the gastrointestinal, central nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Comparative studies with currently available type Ic agents are needed to better define propafenone's place in therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Regurgitation of gastric contents with subsequent aspiration into the lungs contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in surgical and nonsurgical patients. The consequences of aspiration pneumonitis depend on the volume and the acidity of the aspirate, and the presence of particulate and bacteria in the aspirate. The occurrence of aspiration pneumonitis may be prevented by correction of risk factors, careful monitoring, and appropriate airway management. The goal of aspiration pneumonitis prophylaxis is to minimize pulmonary complications by controlling risk factors for gastric regurgitation, which include gastric pH less than or equal to 2.5, gastric volume greater than 25 mL, lower esophageal sphincter incompetence, and delayed peristalsis. Prophylactic techniques include nasogastric decompression, acid neutralization, acid suppression, and increased gastric peristalsis. The ability of drugs to alter risk factors does not guarantee that aspiration will not occur, but it does reduce the likelihood of secondary respiratory complications. The ideal prophylactic agent should consistently reduce all risk factors, produce a prompt and sustained response, and possess few adverse effects and drug interactions.\r"

The catheters ranged in size from 8 French to 14 French.

The success rates according to collection type were 63% (12/19) for exudates, 80% (12/15) for empyemas, and 75% (6/8) for pneumothoraxes. There were two complications: a vasovagal reaction and a sterile collection converted to an empyema. After an initial learning period and with accumulated experience, radiologically placed catheters have proved to be an efficacious treatment of pleural effusions and pneumothoraxes that has a low complication rate.\r"

Regions of interest were identified in the spleens of 14 normal volunteers and eight Hodgkin disease patients before staging laparotomy. An analysis of the narrow-band-filtered waveforms showed that the mean amplitudes of the filtered ultrasonic signals received correlated with the presence of extensive splenic involvement with Hodgkin disease (defined as more than four grossly visible nodules on cut section) (p = .0004). Conversely, mean amplitudes of unfiltered ultrasonic backscatter, employed in conventional sonographic imaging, did not correlate with splenic involvement (p = .5). Phantom studies were performed to develop a tissue model for the observed phenomena; images of the phantoms and of the involved and uninvolved spleens were made by using techniques involving narrow-band filtration of backscattered ultrasound. Our results indicate that narrow-band-filtered sonography holds promise for detecting lymphomatous involvement of the spleen, although larger studies, with equipment allowing real-time implementation of narrow-band filtering, are needed.\r"

In the three cases of acute torsion, no gray scale sonographic abnormalities were seen, and in the two cases of postoperative infarction, the abnormalities were nonspecific. These findings suggest that color Doppler sonography can be used to show decreased blood flow in cases of acute testicular ischemia and that it may have a role in evaluating patients with suspected testicular torsion.\r"

Peak systolic velocity measurements were obtained by placing the sample volume in the highest-velocity flow stream with the angle-correction cursor parallel to the color-encoded lumen. Arterial stenoses were categorized on a grade 1-5 scale: 1 = 0-15%, 2 = 16-49%, 3 = 50-75%, 4 = 76-99%, and 5 = occlusion. Percent diameter stenosis could not be determined in 12 color Doppler flow imaging studies (13%) due to calcified plaque. Of the remaining 83 arteries evaluated by both techniques, the respective categories by color Doppler flow imaging/angiography were grade 1 (16/26), grade 2 (25/24), grade 3 (30/19), grade 4 (5/8), and grade 5 (7/6). Percent diameter stenosis determined by color Doppler flow imaging was greater than by angiography in 25% and less than by angiography in 4%. Peak systolic velocity measurements did not separate the hemodynamically insignificant (less than 50% diameter stenosis) grade 1 and grade 2 lesions, but were in agreement in 86% of grades 3-5 stenotic categories, as determined by measurements from the color Doppler flow image. A direct measurement of percent diameter stenosis from the color Doppler flow image was possible in 87% of cases. Peak systolic velocity provided correlative diagnostic information when assessing hemodynamically significant lesions.\r"

The relative contribution of obesity and body fat distribution indices to fasting and oral glucose-stimulated C peptide, insulin, and glucose concentrations were determined in 33 healthy premenopausal women. Obesity level was assessed by hydrostatic weighing and fat topography by computerized tomography-derived intraabdominal fat area, waist to hip ratio, subscapular skinfold thickness and the ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness. Both fat mass and regional fat distribution indices were associated closely with changes in insulin secretion. Fat topography indices were more closely correlated (p less than 0.001) to insulin response than were fat mass indices (p less than 0.01). The subscapular skinfold thickness had the greatest integrity for reflecting fat mass and fat distribution as they relate to the metabolic profile. The subscapular skinfold thickness may help identify individuals at risk for noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

To improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, the authors studied nine ovarian and eight vaginal clear-cell carcinomas and seven endodermal sinus tumors of the ovary by immunohistochemical methods with the use of antibodies to alpha-fetoprotein and Leu-M1. Sixteen (94.1%) of the 17 clear-cell carcinomas and two (28.5%) of the seven endodermal sinus tumors reacted for Leu-M1, whereas six (85.7%) of the seven endodermal sinus tumors and three (17.6%) of the 17 clear-cell carcinomas stained for alpha-fetoprotein. Three clear-cell carcinomas and two endodermal sinus tumors showed immunoreactivity for both markers. No reactivity for either of these markers was present in one endodermal sinus tumor and one clear-cell carcinoma. All 13 tumors that stained only for Leu-M1 proved to be clear-cell carcinomas, and the four that reacted exclusively for alpha-fetoprotein were endodermal sinus tumors. Therefore, the authors concluded that positive immunostaining for Leu-M1 and negative immunostaining for alpha-fetoprotein support the differential diagnosis of clear-cell carcinoma, whereas a positive reaction for alpha-fetoprotein and a negative reaction for Leu-M1 favor a diagnosis of endodermal sinus tumor. However, positive or negative staining for both markers appears to have no diagnostic value.\r"

The chromophore detection rates of Streptococcus mitis were 60.7, 67.9, and 78.6% after growth in THBP, THBP + YE, and CDMT, respectively. After growth in THBP there was significantly lower chromophore detection than either THBP + YE or CDMT for NVS (P less than 0.001), with a trend toward significantly less detection for S. mitis (0.15 greater than P). For Streptococcus sanguis II the detection rates were 45.7, 57.1, and 54.3%, respectively, for each medium. There was no significant difference between the detection rates after growth in THBP + YE or CDMT. One NVS was persistently chromophore negative, the first so described. There was a similar number of presumably false positive chromophore S. sanguis I strains (3 of 12) detected after growth in THBP + YE or CDMT. The sensitivity of chromophore detection for NVS (pooling results in THBP + YE and CDMT) was 95.8% and specificity was 59.6%. For a nonvariant streptococcus, the sensitivity was 61.9% and specificity was 93.5% for an isolate to be either S. mitis or S. sanguis II.\r"

Slide cultures made from mold colonies produced slender conidial forms with annellations and spine-like conidiophores, features characteristic of Exophiala spinifera. The lesion was surgically excised, and the patient was successfully treated with a course of oral itraconazole. This nodular lesion has not recurred at the time of this writing.

A critical review of this literature, employing 14 methodological and reporting criteria, revealed that only three studies adequately fulfilled nine of the criteria; the remaining studies used a less rigorous design. Of those three articles, two used statistical analysis and concluded that the results were negative, while the third utilized clinical analysis only and demonstrated positive results. Evidence for the usefulness of this therapy has yet to be demonstrated; with the presently available methodologies it is ethically imperative to institute a properly designed, collaborative, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric emptying of two different test liquid meals (500 ml isotonic saline and 500 ml skimmed milk, 1.8% fat) has been measured in 10 (saline) and in 19 (milk) normal volunteers by means of real-time ultrasonography (RUS) and scintigraphy, employed simultaneously. In each subject, saline and milk contained 37 MBq of diethylenetriaminopentacetic acid (DPTA) marked with 99mTc. Determinations were made thereafter every 5 min up to 45 min with saline and every 30 min up to a maximum of 220 min with milk. The determination of gastric emptying by RUS was obtained indirectly through the measurement of gastric dimensions, with a single scan performed at the epigastrium, while the subject was kept in a standing position. At each observation, the percent decrease of gastric measurements and the decay in radioactivity over the gastric region were calculated, blind, by two independent examiners. Linear regression and correlation coefficient were subsequently computed for gastric measurements and decay in radioactivity. The results show that the values obtained with RUS do not differ grossly from the ones obtained with scintigraphy. This suggests that the ultrasonographic determination of gastric dimensions with a single section of the stomach may be a valuable method for use in the evaluation of gastric emptying of liquids.\r"

  ".W": "There is increased awareness that infection with Campylobacter pylori could be a major factor in the pathogenesis of gastric disease. Here, we present evidence that the extracellular protease elaborated by this bacteria, which causes degradation of gastric mucus, is inhibited by an antiulcer agent, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS; De-Nol). The study was conducted with C. pylori cultured from antral mucosal biopsy specimens of patients undergoing gastroscopy. The grown colonies of bacteria were washed with saline, filtered through sterilization filter, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The powder was used as the enzyme source for proteolytic activity assay employing pig gastric mucus as substrate. Optimum enzymatic activity was obtained at 37 degrees C and at pH 7.0. The apparent Km of C. pylori protease with gastric mucus was 0.71 g/L. Analyses of the degradation products indicated that the protease caused extensive proteolysis of mucus glycoprotein polymer. Introduction of CBS to the incubation mixtures led to a reduction of the rate of mucus degradation. The rate of proteolysis inhibition was proportional to CBS concentration up to 1 X 10(-1) g/L, at which point a 37% reduction in mucus proteolysis was obtained. The Km value for proteolytic degradation of mucus by C. pylori protease in the presence of CBS was 1.25 g/L. The results suggest that CBS is capable of counter-acting the proteolysis of the protective gastric mucus layer by C. pylori.\r"

With regard to sites of isolated islets, we found an incidence of 26.5% (53/200, 115 sites), which increased with age until subjects were in their 80s. To further our study, we also histologically studied the pancreas in 13 cases with evident obstruction in the lower stream of the main pancreatic ducts due to pancreatic carcinoma (10 cases) and stones (three cases), and one case of mucin-producing intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma in the tail of the pancreas with abundant mucin in the main pancreatic duct. As a result, we believe its pathogenesis to be the obstructive mechanism of pancreatic ductuli, caused by epithelial papillary projection or mucin secreted by epithelial cells of mucinous metaplasia, and that the course to the terminal state of isolated islets is as follows: For the first time, we report that the atrophy and disappearance of acinar cells by obstructive mechanism of ductuli (described above) occur with fibrosis, inflammatory cellular infiltration, and fatty infiltration around the site of isolated islets, accompanied by gathering of islets. This is followed by scarring of the site with further gathering of islets and a decrease in inflammatory cells. Fibrosis is gradually displaced by fatty tissue. Fatty infiltration into the site becomes marked, and gathered islets are found in the fatty tissue.\r"

Oral load of 300 mg acarbose did not inhibit absorption of 50 g glucose; neither did it alter subsequent responses of insulin and glucagons. Maltose absorption was not influenced by acarbose up to 300 mg. However, insulin response was reduced and eteroglucagon response was enhanced by acarbose. Acarbose 100 mg markedly decreased absorption of sucrose, resulting in inhibition of plasma elevation of glucose and insulin and in enhancement of enteroglucagon release. Oral load of 30 g lactulose, nonabsorbable disaccharide, could reproduce the acarbose-induced enteroglucagon release. An increase in osmotic pressure due to retention of unabsorbed carbohydrate in the distal small intestine and proximal colon may explain the acarbose-induced enteroglucagon release and diarrhea that results from STT with acarbose.\r"

The studies were performed during first and third uses of cuprammonium rayon and polysulfone dialyzers processed by rinsing with water, then bleach, in an automated system (Seratronics DRS 4) and then packed in 1.5% formaldehyde. Mean serum beta 2M (corrected for ultrafiltration) decreased by 16.6% +/- 18.1% with new cuprammonium dialyzers and 57.1% +/- 12.8% with new polysulfone dialyzers. Dialyzer reprocessing had no significant effect on this decline. Predialysis serum beta 2M decreased by 30.4% +/- 15.5% 1 month after switching from cuprammonium to polysulfone dialyzers; these levels remained stable after 3 months of dialysis with polysulfone. Complement activation and neutropenia during dialysis were significantly more marked with cuprammonium, but were not affected by reprocessing of either dialyzer. In vitro adsorption of 124I-beta 2M to polysulfone fibers was greater than to cuprammonium; adsorption was not influenced by dialyzer reprocessing.\r"

  ".W": "From 1979 to 1988, 82 allogeneic and 2 syngeneic bone marrow transplants (BMT) were performed in 78 patients (age range 13-49 years) with the following diagnoses: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (21 patients); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (15 patients); chronic myelocytic leukemia in chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase (CML-CP, AP or BC) (25 patients); myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (1 patient); multiple myeloma (MM) (1 patient); Hodgkin's disease (HD) (1 patient); diffuse poorly differentiated lymphoma (DPDL) (1 patient); aplastic anemia (AA) (13 patients). Univariant analyses were carried out to determine factors of importance in predicting outcome. AML patients receiving transplants in remission had 12/19 (63%) survivors. Only one of seven ALL patients receiving transplants in remission survives free of disease, and none of eight patients receiving transplants in relapse survived. Six ALL patients relapsed. In CML, 6 of 16 (40%) patients receiving transplants in CP survive; two of nine patients (22%) in AP or BC survive. Of the 13 aplastic anemias, 8 (62%) survive. Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) was evaluated in 75 patients, 24 of 33 (73%) who developed GVHD died, compared to 24 of 44 (55%) who did not develop GVHD. Of the 30 patients given the combination of methotrexate (MTX) plus cyclosporine (CSP), only 23% developed GVHD, compared to 58% of those not given the combination. Interstitial pneumonia (IP) occurred in 16 patients and was fatal in 15. The introduction of daily acyclovir and weekly intravenous gamma globulin in 1985 was associated with little reduction in the frequency of IP (from 20% to 18%). However, survival increased from 21% to 47%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We now provide evidence that this endothelial cell mediation may be necessary for hepatocyte uptake of TF-Fe complexes. Transport of TF-Fe from endothelial cell to hepatocyte was studied in mixed cell suspensions in which radiolabeled TF-Fe complexes were incubated at 37 degrees C with the two cell populations purified and then mixed in equal ratios. The mixtures were then refractionated at various times after incubation and cell-associated radioactivities measured. Radiolabeled TF was rapidly taken up by the endothelial cell fraction, but radioactivity began to decline in this fraction as it increased in the hepatocyte fraction. In double labeling experiments with 125I-TF-59Fe, both radiolabels moved across the endothelium in parallel fashion, indicating that Fe remains associated with TF during transcytosis. However, in hepatocytes the two radiolabels became dissociated, with Fe remaining cell-associated and TF being recycled. Hepatocyte uptake of processed TF was partially inhibitable by galactan and asialofetuin, indicating that hepatocyte uptake may occur via asialoglycoprotein receptors of hepatocyte.\r"

However, the stratum corneum is an effective barrier to the absorption of most chemicals from the external environment into the body. To evaluate techniques for alteration of transdermal permeability, the authors studied the effect of low levels of electrical current on transport of a protein across the stratum corneum. Transcutaneous insulin absorption was used as an indicator of altered permeability. Twenty-six albino rabbits had acute diabetes mellitus induced by the intravenous administration of 125 mg/kg of alloxan. The animals then received either cutaneous patches containing insulin and an electrical current of 0.4 mA (active) or patches containing an equal amount of insulin but without electrical current (passive). At 10 and 12 hours after the placement of the patches, animals with active patches had significant elevations in serum insulin levels (p less than .05) and reduction in blood glucose levels (p less than .01). No changes were seen in controls. Animals with active patches also had significant differences from control animals in mean insulin response and peak insulin response (p less than .05). No cutaneous toxicity was observed in any of the animals. The authors conclude that low levels of electrical current can induce changes in stratum corneum permeability that are sufficient to produce the transdermal absorption of physiologic doses of a protein such as human insulin.\r"

Chest x-ray showed widening of the superior mediastinum, and CT scan showed a large mass with a fluid level. Surgery revealed a large hematoma originating from a mediastinal parathyroid adenoma with a hemorrhagic infarct. Serum calcium, previously elevated, decreased to normal with the onset of neck pain, and the patient remains normocalcemic. Previous reported cases of this rare complication of parathyroid adenomas are reviewed. Hemorrhagic infarct of a parathyroid adenoma may present with a rapidly enlarging mediastinal mass, and/or hypercalcemic crisis. Surgical removal of the infarcted adenoma can return the serum calcium to normal.\r"

Also observed were a decline in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and greater decreases in high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels; the latter were below the lower limits of laboratory's reference range. All other changes remained within clinically acceptable limits. There were no statistically significant differences between the test preparations, suggesting that the impact on lipid metabolism of the triphasic preparations Triphasil and Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 are similar and, given the dynamic balance between the various fractions, are unlikely to impart an adverse cardiovascular risk.\r"

  ".W": "Three new 19-nortestosterone progestogens, which are chemically related to levonorgestrel, are now clinically available in combination oral contraceptives in Europe. Desogestrel and norgestimate must be transformed to metabolites for all or part of their biologic activity; gestodene is active in its original form. Compared with present low-dose monophasic and triphasic levonorgestrel formulations, the new combinations appear to be equivalent in efficacy and type and frequency of side effects. Cycle control may be slightly improved with the gestodene preparation and somewhat poorer with the desogestrel regimen. As with the present triphasics, most changes reported in coagulation indexes for the new combinations remained within normal limits, as did changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There is no present evidence that either the norgestimate or aesogestrel formulation provides a clinical improvement over the levonorgestrel triphasic. In the gestodene combination, the progestogen's increased biologic activity allows further reduction of total steroid dose.\r"

Although there is conflicting literature, most research strongly suggests that estrogens, and estrogen replacement therapy in particular, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Such reduced risk in estrogen users is most likely mediated in part by the beneficial effects of estrogen therapy on lipid metabolism. Risks associated with the use of estrogens and possible effects when progestational agents are added to an estrogen regimen are also discussed.\r"

Calcium supplementation, although probably important before menopause, cannot stop bone loss alone in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal phases. Estrogen replacement therapy remains the treatment of choice. As little as 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens can inhibit bone loss. Oral contraceptives also have a beneficial effect on bone density. Although fluoride therapy can increase bone mass, objectionable side effects rule out its use.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) membrane proteins in the in situ formation of subepithelial immune deposits, the authors raised a rabbit antiserum against GEC that had been grown in culture (anti-GEC). By indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on normal rat kidney, anti-GEC stained proximal tubular brush border (BB). After intravenous injection into animals, granular glomerular capillary wall staining for IgG was present by IE and subepithelial immune deposits were identified by standard transmission and immunoelectron microscopy. Using the latter technique, injected anti-GEC IgG was identified beneath slit diaphragms and in endocytic-coated pits and intracellular vesicles of podocytes. Anti-GEC immunoprecipitated gp330 and two other proteins from radiolabeled BB. These proteins also were identified by sheep anti-rat Fx1A, the antiserum responsible for passive Heymann nephritis. Anti-GEC and anti-Fx1A also immunoprecipitated five identical proteins from surface-labeled GEC. Biosynthetically-labeled but not surface-labeled GEC contained immunoprecipitable gp330. Thus, injection into rats of antibodies raised against cultured GEC can produce subepithelial immune deposits, a disease process classically induced by antibodies to BB or its purified components. In addition to gp330, GEC and BB share other antigenic determinants that may contribute to the formation of these immune deposits.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to identify neural cells that synthesize and/or process cerebral amyloid using antisera and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised to synthetic peptides based on the first 28 amino acids of the amyloid beta-protein. Using rabbit and mouse antisera, and 7 MAbs, sections of neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down's syndrome (DS), and control cases were probed. The antibodies produced 3 distinct immunohistochemical patterns: 1) staining restricted to neuritic plaque and blood vessel amyloid only (antisera, 1 of 7 MAbs); 2) immunoreactivity confined to cytoplasmic granules in diverse neuronal, glial (astrocytes, ependyma) and other (leptomeningeal, perivascular, choroid plexus) cells (1 of 7 MAbs); 3) a summation of these 2 patterns (5 of 7 MAbs). Controls resembled the AD and DS cases, except for a paucity of immunoreactive plaques and blood vessels in the controls. Immunoreactivity was reduced or removed by the peptides used to produce these antibodies. Formalin- and Bouins-fixed tissues reacted weakly or not at all with these antibodies while microwave denatured tissues reacted very intensely with them. Specific staining was enhanced by treatment of the tissue sections with Triton X-100, NaDodSO4, or trypsin. These studies significantly extend earlier studies that localized amyloid beta-protein precursor mRNA to human brain cells, and they suggest that the beta-protein, its precursor, and/or fragments thereof may exist in diverse neural cell types in AD, DS, and control brains.\r"

Determinations of plasma histamine concentrations were made to examine the possible correlation between these levels and changes in heart rate and blood pressure as well as a possible relationship with skin reactions after the administration of the relaxants. Patients who received vecuronium without the anticholinergic drug, glycopyrronium, showed a greater tendency towards bradycardia (though not statistically significant) than those given atracurium. More cutaneous reactions were observed with patients who received atracurium than in those with vecuronium, but there was no correlation with plasma histamine concentrations of either relaxant group. There was no correlation either between histamine concentrations and heart rate or blood pressure associated with atracurium. The incidence of bradycardia with either relaxant is low if the anaesthetic technique and the surgery are devoid of vagal activity.\r"

If dural puncture occurred, an observer unaware of the needle bevel direction, daily assessed the presence and severity of any subsequent headache. Of the 1,558 women who received epidural analgesia during this study, 41 women suffered dural puncture, 20 with the needle bevel oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal dural fibers and 21 with the needle bevel inserted parallel to the dural fibers (NS). Fourteen of 20 women in the group in which the needle bevel was perpendicular to dural fibers developed a moderate to severe headache, whereas only five of 21 in the group in which the needle bevel was parallel to dural fibers did so (P less than 0.005). Similarly, we administered a therapeutic blood patch to ten of 20 women in the perpendicular group but to only four of 21 in the parallel group (P less than 0.05). Thus, identifying the epidural space with the needle bevel oriented parallel to the longitudinal dural fibers limits the size of the subsequent dural tear and, therefore, lowers the incidence of headache should dural perforation occur.\r"

The study was conducted on 30 patients who underwent major orthopedic or urologic surgery. The intrathecal opioid was administered at the end of surgery, and assessments began 1 h thereafter and continued for 20 h. Pain measurements, supplementary analgesia requirements, and adverse effects were recorded. Intrathecal morphine (0.5 and 1 mg) provided effective and prolonged analgesia. Methadone, however, was unable to ensure the same degree of analgesia; consequently, the median pain scores were consistently higher following methadone than morphine (0.5 and 1 mg) (P less than 0.05). The time to the onset of discomfort severe enough to require supplemental morphine was longer after intrathecal morphine than that following methadone (24 and 29 h with morphine 0.5 and 1 mg; 6.5 h with methadone; P less than 0.05). Respiratory depression (increases PaCO2) was not associated with methadone and morphine 0.5 mg but was common following morphine 1 mg (P less than 0.05). Facial pruritus was unique to intrathecal morphine. Urinary retention requiring bladder catheterization was more frequent following morphine than methadone, although this was not statistically significant. Nausea and vomiting were common to all groups. Intrathecal morphine (0.5 and 1 mg) provides superior postoperative analgesia to 1 mg methadone. Various explanations for the observed differences between the drugs are discussed, including the possibility that the dose of methadone used in the subarachnoid space was inadequate and that a larger dose might have produced an effect equal to that of morphine.\r"

In the diagnosis group 48 patients had venographic evidence of thrombosis. The predictive value of abnormal findings from real-time US was 97%, and that of a negative study was 75%. Thus, real-time US may have a role as a diagnostic procedure, to be followed by x-ray venography in patients with negative US results. By contrast, real-time US is far less sensitive as a screening test in patients without clinical evidence of thrombosis. Only 3 of 9 patients with thrombosis were detected, with a 50% sensitivity for proximal vein thrombosis. Therefore, the use of real-time US for screening high-risk patients must be limited to very high risk patients in whom other tests are ineffective (as in hip surgery).\r"

The angiography was so typical that the diagnosis of inflammatory arteritis was made, despite negative temporal artery biopsy. The patient with thumb gangrene was successfully operated on, the occlusive axillary lesions being bypassed by a long venous carotid humeral bypass graft. A biopsy of the axillary artery showed a granulomatous lymphoplasmocellular infiltration. A high-dose corticotherapy (24 mg daily) was begun in both cases, with dramatic improvements of general state, lowering of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and even reapparition of a reduced radial pulse in 1 patient. The authors discuss the incidence, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of systemic giant cell arteritis, with special attention to extracranial involvement. These case reports may broaden the knowledge of the diverse manifestations of giant cell arteritis and of its systemic character with widespread vascular involvement.\r"

When positive, they are probably only 10% accurate. The newer laboratory tests for food allergy are expensive and highly sophisticated. They are impractical for use in the laboratories of practicing allergists with whom individuals with a potential food allergy are most liable to consult. The RAST is capable of identifying only Type I of the Gell-Coombs' reaction classification. Since 1980, a patch test of individual foods suspended in dimethylsulfoxide has been used as a screen for sensitivity to foods. Controlled clinical studies suggest this might prove to be a valuable test for food allergy. Immune studies appear to confirm the accuracy and reliability of this inexpensive test. No systemic reactions have been observed in the 400 patients tested indicating it to be a safe procedure.\r"

Acutely injured patients meeting the advanced trauma life support criteria for lavage were first studied with computed tomography followed by diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Patients underwent exploratory celiotomy for positive results of either study. Computed tomography was read initially by the radiology resident and then by the trauma fellow or senior surgery resident or both. A second interpretation was made by senior radiology staff. Analyses included sensitivity, specificity, false-negative, false-positive, predictive value of positive and negative tests, and accuracy for lavage and each tomography interpretation. Lavage was found to be more accurate than computed tomography in the immediate diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma and remains the diagnostic test of choice at our institution. Caution is advised in using computed tomography as the primary diagnostic technique until the reliability is demonstrated at any particular institution.\r"

  ".W": "Patients commonly present to the emergency department with a suspected diagnosis of renal colic. A prospective study of 98 patients presenting with acute flank or abdominal pain or both was conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound scan compared with excretory urography for the diagnosis of urinary tract calculi. All patients underwent standardized ultrasound scan and excretory urography as independent procedures. Two staff radiologists who reported the procedures were blinded to the results of the other diagnostic test and ultimate clinical outcome. All patients discharged home from the ED were followed to the hospital urology clinic. The diagnosis of urinary calculus was made only by identification of calculus at surgery or by reported passage of a stone by the patient. Of 85 patients available for follow-up study (56 men, 29 women; mean age, 40.5 years; range 18 to 77 years), calculi were identified in 69 (81%). Ultrasound identified calculi in 44 patients (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 100%). Excretory urography identified calculi in 44 patients (identical sensitivity and specificity). When the presence of obstructive hydronephrosis only was used to diagnose renal calculi, ultrasound scan identified 59 patients (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 100%) and excretory urography identified 62 patients (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 94%). When the results of both diagnostic modalities were combined, calculi were identified in 59 patients (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 100%) and hydronephrosis was seen in 66 patients (sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 94%). Our study shows that the diagnostic abilities of these procedures are equal in the detection of renal calculi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While the diagnosis of this condition is usually on the basis of wet-mount microscope slide preparations, other diagnostic technology exists. We studied the accuracy of the traditional wet-mount technique as compared with detection using direct immunofluorescence and culture techniques in ED patients with the presenting complaint of vaginal discharge. Of 157 patients evaluated, the wet-mount technique detected 27 cases of Trichomonas, compared with 35 cases diagnosed by direct immunofluorescence and 52 cases detected by culture. This represents a false-negative rate for the wet-mount technique of 51%; the false-negative rates for direct immunofluorescence and culture technique were 36% and 5%, respectively. Our study suggests that the wet-mount technique is relatively insensitive in the detection of Trichomonas vaginitis.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical markers and preoperative dipyridamole-thallium imaging are both useful in predicting ischemic events after vascular surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Two hundred fifty-four consecutive patients referred to a nuclear cardiology laboratory before surgery. Forty-four patients had surgery cancelled or postponed after clinical evaluation and dipyridamole-thallium imaging. Surgery was not confirmed for ten. Two hundred patients receiving prompt vascular surgery were the study group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty patients (15%) had early postoperative cardiac ischemic events, with cardiac death in 6 (3%) and nonfatal myocardial infarction in 9 (4.5%). Logistic regression identified five clinical predictors (Q waves, history of ventricular ectopic activity, diabetes, advanced age, angina) and two dipyridamole-thallium predictors of postoperative events. Of patients with none of the clinical variables (n = 64), only 2 (3.1%; 95% CI, 0% to 8%) had ischemic events with no cardiac deaths. Ten of twenty (50%; 95% CI, 29% to 71%) patients with three or more clinical markers had events. Eighteen of one hundred sixteen (15.5%; 95% CI, 7% to 21%) patients with either 1 or 2 clinical predictors had events. Within this group, 2 of 62 (3.2%; 95% CI, 0% to 8%) patients without thallium redistribution had events compared with 16 events in 54 patients (29.6%; 95% CI, 16% to 44%) with thallium redistribution. The multivariate model using both clinical and thallium variables showed significantly higher specificity at equivalent sensitivity levels than models using either clinical or thallium variables alone. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative dipyridamole-thallium imaging appears most useful to stratify vascular patients determined to be at intermediate risk by clinical evaluation. For patients with one or two clinical predictors, thallium redistribution correlates with substantial change in probability of events. For nearly half the patients, however, thallium imaging may have been unnecessary because of very high or low cardiac risk predicted by clinical information alone.\r"

Women participating in exercise or dietary programs or taking medication were excluded. All subjects completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Total body fat mass was determined by hydrostatic weighting, and fat distribution was assessed by subscapular skinfold thickness, subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio, the waist-to-hip ratio, and computed tomography. Cardiovascular risk was assessed by the serum insulin response during oral glucose stimulation; levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to total cholesterol concentrations; and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The anthropometric parameters chosen were significantly associated with the cardiovascular risk profile (P less than 0.001). Visceral fat distribution assessed by computed tomography accounted for a significantly greater degree of variance in the cardiovascular risk factors than the total body fat mass (P less than 0.05). The cumulative insulin response was the primary metabolic variable relating the anthropometric indices to cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal fat deposition constitutes a greater cardiovascular risk than obesity alone. Hyperinsulinemia may constitute an important component of the increased cardiovascular risk of abdominal obesity.\r"

DESIGN: A 10-week prospective incidence study (group 1), and then an 8-week randomized, open trial of intestinal decontamination (groups 2 and 3). SETTING: A medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with unit stay of over 2 days and a severity score at admission of more than 2; 124 patients were included in group 1, 50 in group 2 (control), and 36 in group 3 (intestinal decontamination). INTERVENTIONS: Neomycin, polymyxin E, and nalidixic acid were given to group 3 patients throughout their stay in the unit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intestinal colonization with multiresistant strains occurred in 19.6% of patients in group 1, at a mean of 16 days after admission, and preceded detection in clinical samples by a mean of 11 days. During the decontamination trial, intestinal colonization rates decreased to 10% (group 2), and 3% (group 3) (P = 0.12 and P less than 0.01, compared with group 1, respectively). Corresponding infection rates were 9% (group 1), 3% (group 2), and 0 (group 3). No new cases were detected in the following 4 months. The intestinal colonization rate with gram-positive cocci was higher in group 3 than group 2 (P less than 0.001). The overall rate of nosocomial infections was at 28% (group 1), 33% (group 2), and 32% (group 3). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal decontamination can help to control an outbreak of intestinal colonization and infection with multiresistant gram-negative bacilli in the intensive care unit, but should not be recommended for routine prevention of endemic nosocomial infections.\r"

Many elements of the diagnostic process have been identified, and many principles of effective clinical reasoning have been formulated. Three reasoning strategies are considered here: probabilistic, causal, and deterministic. Probabilistic reasoning relies on the statistical relations between clinical variables and is frequently used in formal calculations of disease likelihoods. Probabilistic reasoning is especially useful in evoking diagnostic hypotheses and in assessing the significance of clinical findings and test results. Causal reasoning builds a physiologic model and assesses a patient's findings for coherency and completeness against the model; it functions especially effectively in verification of diagnostic hypotheses. Deterministic reasoning consists of sets of compiled rules generated from routine, well-defined practices. Much human problem solving may derive from activation and implementation of such rules. A deeper understanding of clinical cognition should enhance clinical teaching and patient care.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1972-1988) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: Primary research articles on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of hypertension in the elderly were reviewed. Particular emphasis was placed on large randomized clinical trials. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design and quality were assessed, with particular attention to subject selection, sample size, definition of outcome variables, and applicability of the results to management of the elderly hypertensive patient. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Epidemiologic studies confirm that elevated systolic blood pressure in the elderly is more highly correlated with subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than is elevation of diastolic blood pressure. Results of several large randomized trials of the treatment of diastolic hypertension in elderly patients indicate that treatment is beneficial, at least up to age 80. For instance, the European Working Party on Hypertension in the Elderly reported that drug treatment resulted in a significant relative reduction (27%) in overall cardiovascular mortality, or an absolute reduction of 29 fewer cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years of treatment. Data from well-designed studies are not available to make a definitive statement about the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension. CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular risk reduction from treating mild to moderate diastolic hypertension in the elderly is significant, but the magnitude of absolute risk reduction is not so great that treatment should invariably be pursued if serious side effects cannot be avoided.\r"

In normal mice the efficacy of treatment, which was assessed on the basis of the number of C. albicans cultured from the kidney, was greater for amphotericin B than for the triazoles. Fluconazole was more potent than itraconazole on the basis of equivalent doses, although itraconazole was more potent on the basis of the amount of free drug that was available. In neutropenic mice amphotericin B was less effective than it was in normal mice, whereas the triazoles were equally effective in normal and neutropenic mice. This was not expected, since in vitro data showed that amphotericin B was highly fungicidal, whereas both fluconazole and itraconazole had only a minimal effect on the growth of C. albicans in vitro.\r"

In vitro toxic effects of the drugs on human erythrocytes and Candida albicans were determined by measuring leakage of intracellular potassium ions (K+). Liposomal formulations of both drugs greatly reduced K+ leakage from human erythrocytes, whereas liposomal gramicidin S, but not liposomal amphotericin B, prevented K+ leakage from C. albicans. In both free and liposomal forms, the combinations of drugs produced decreased toxicity to erythrocytes compared with the drugs alone. This protective effect was more apparent with liposomal combinations than with free drug combinations. A significant increase in fungal cell toxicity was observed, however, when free and liposomal drug combinations were tested against C. albicans. The results suggest that optimal concentrations of liposomal drug combinations (amphotericin B and gramicidin S) may provide increased toxicity against fungal cells and simultaneously protect mammalian cells.\r"

Multiple regression analysis of the relationship between physical properties of 20 glycopeptides and their in vitro activities against the vancomycin-susceptible mutant revealed a significant correlation with molecular mass (P = 0.007). pI, hydrophobicity, and affinity of the glycopeptide for the pentapeptide target were not as important for activity. This suggested that a block of access of the antibiotic to its target could be the major factor determining activity. Outer membrane proteins of the vancomycin-susceptible mutant, resistant parent, and revertant strains appeared normal. The mutant exhibited increased susceptibility to both erythromycin and fusidic acid which was lost in single-step revertants to vancomycin resistance. Polymyxin B nonapeptide was synergistic with erythromycin and fusidic acid against the parent and revertant but not against the susceptible mutant. Analysis of the susceptibilities of control strains of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium with known defects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis revealed that core LPS mutants (Re chemotype) were phenotypically similar to the E. coli mutant under study. However, the LPS core of the mutant migrated slightly less rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than wild-type or revertant core LPS and did not resemble Re chemotype LPS core obtained from Salmonella rfaC and rfaD mutants. These data suggest that defects in LPS core structure other than loss of heptose moieties may also be important in loss of resistance to large, hydrophilic molecules such as glycopeptides.\r"

  ".W": "SM-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. At a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, SM-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. The spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. A collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by SM-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. SM-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. Of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but SM-7338 was much more active against Haemophilus, Branhamella, and Neisseria spp. and all genera of Enterobacteriaceae tested. The MIC of SM-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. When tested against 124 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SM-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. Both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against Bacteroides spp., but SM-7338 was more active than imipenem against Clostridium spp. The MBC of SM-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the MIC. SM-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Advances in management of the rheumatic diseases over the past 20 years have been substantial. Over this period, survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus improved dramatically. Previously fatal renal crisis in scleroderma became treatable. Survival in Wegener's granulomatosis improved from 7% after 2 years to over 90%. Gout became an easily and effectively managed disease. Polymyalgia rheumatica became readily recognized and dramatically treatable. Less quantifiably, the shift toward more aggressive use of an increasing repertoire of \"disease-modifying\" agents in rheumatoid arthritis gave hope of having altered the natural history of the disease. Replacement of destroyed joints dramatically reduced pain and improved function in appropriately selected individuals. An increasingly broad mission of the National Institutes of Health has provided support for systematic evaluation of clinical management, including the Multi-Purpose Arthritis Centers, the American Rheumatism Association Medical Information System, and the Cooperating Clinics, effectively complementing research in fundamental mechanisms of disease. The role of the concerned clinician and the clinical epidemiologist in identification of new syndromes and new diseases and in innovating approaches to their management has been extremely important; this role appears far from over.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if there were characteristics that distinguish elderly patients with heart failure (greater than 65 years of age) from younger patients with heart failure. We studied 128 consecutively admitted patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) under uniform conditions, with measurement of systemic hemodynamics, vasoactive hormones and sodium status, and renal function. Additional characterization included the hemodynamic response to gravitational stress (head-up tilt; n = 65), and renal blood flow and function by steady-state clearance techniques (n = 46). Compared with younger patients with CHF, there was a greater frequency of ischemic heart disease in the elderly patients with CHF. Within the CHF population there was an increase of systemic vascular resistance and a trend of decreased heart rate with aging. Heart rate responsiveness was attenuated during tilt according to age. Circulating norepinephrine increased with aging, but a clear-cut age-related effect was not observed for renin system activity or sodium status. Both serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine increased with age. More detailed renal studies confirmed an age-related decrease of glomerular filtration rate and a noncompensatory filtration fraction, despite increasing renal vascular resistance. We conclude that elderly patients with CHF have relatively greater vasoconstriction (or decreased compliance) and blunted heart rate responsiveness associated with increased circulating norepinephrine. Furthermore, renal function in the elderly patient with CHF is markedly compromised. These findings are consistent with superimposition of an aging effect on the CHF process, which must be considered in evaluating the response to drug therapy and the outcome of multicenter CHF trials.\r"

However, a clear demonstration of this phenomenon is still lacking for fluorinated corticosteroids. We performed an oral glucose tolerance test in six healthy volunteers after the short-term administration of deflazacort (18 + 18 mg), prednisone (15 + 15 mg), and betamethasone disodium phosphate (1.5 + 1.5 mg) at equivalent anti-inflammatory doses, in random sequence, and in a triple crossover design. Fasting plasma glucose levels were not modified by deflazacort, whereas fasting plasma glucose levels together with insulin and C-peptide values were progressively and significantly increased by prednisone and betamethasone. During oral glucose tolerance testing a significant increase in the plasma glucose and insulin peaks was recorded after betamethasone and, to a lesser extent, after prednisone and deflazacort. These results suggest that betamethasone induces greater glucose intolerance and insulin resistance than prednisone and deflazacort.\r"

Ninety-seven percent of the grafts remained clear at their latest follow-up examination. Cystoid macular edema (36.4%) and age-related macular degeneration (14.0%) accounted for poor visual acuity in most cases.

  ".W": "Twelve patients (17 eyes) with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome were analyzed with special reference to the development of an acute optic neuropathy. Six patients (9 eyes) without acute optic nerve involvement were treated with intravenous acyclovir sodium and/or vitreoretinal surgery (group 1). Six patients (8 eyes) fulfilling absolute and relative criteria for acute retinal necrosis optic neuropathy were treated with intravenous acyclovir as well as optic nerve sheath decompression, and, in addition, some of these patients also underwent vitreoretinal surgery. Despite more pronounced initial visual loss compared with group 1, six eyes in group 2 regained visual acuity of 20/400 or better. In contrast, only 2 of 9 eyes in group 1 maintained their entry level visual acuity, and the visual acuities of the remaining 7 eyes deteriorated to counting fingers or worse. Therefore, the acute optic neuropathy complicating the acute retinal necrosis syndrome appears to benefit from prompt recognition and surgical decompression of the intraorbital optic nerve meninges in conjunction with intravenous acyclovir.\r"

All eyes were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at monthly intervals for clinical appearance and refractive alteration. In a preliminary surgical series, several factors, such as tight sutures and implant design, resulted in a poor refractive yield. The final surgical series used a microkeratome with a pediatric microkeratome ring for smooth interface cuts, interrupted suturing with sufficient tension to align the wound without compression, a suture through the lens to prevent its dislocation, and intraoperative keratometry to reduce postoperative cylinder. The predicted vs measured refractive alteration for a range of 6 to 20 diopters had a correlation coefficient of .95. Keratometry changes correlated to the refractive changes with a coefficient of .97 but understand the change in refraction created by the surgery.\r"

The other idiotypes were not increased in biopsy samples from patients with SLE. Deposition of IdGN2 was associated with a subendothelial location of Ig and proliferative changes in the glomeruli. In studies of glomerular eluates from 4 immunosuppressed SLE patients, an average of 26% of total Ig and 37% of anti-DNA was composed of IdGN2. Compared with IdGN2- immunoglobulin, IdGN2+ immunoglobulin was enriched in IgG1 in all 4 eluates, and was enriched in high-avidity anti-DNA in 2 eluates. IdGN2 is a marker of antibody subsets that are characteristic of SLE and are associated with severe lupus nephritis.\r"

We report a case of benign lymphocytic angiitis of T cell lineage. Extensive studies found no evidence of viral antigens in the inflammatory infiltrates, and immunologic evaluation of the pathologic lesions revealed the infiltrating cells to be predominantly CD3+, CD8+, CD4-. A significant number of these lymphocytes demonstrated a deletion of T cell antigen receptor determinants. We believe that in certain cases of human immunodeficiency virus disease, there occurs a spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders with angiocentric features that lead to the clinical picture of systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Clinicians should be aware of this association.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure (BP), plasma renin concentration (PRC), and 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepenta acetate (DTPA) renography with determination of single kidney 99mTc-DTPA clearance and parenchymal mean transit time (MTT) were measured in exactly the same way on two consecutive days in 14 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH), unilateral renal artery stenosis in nine and bilateral stenosis in five, and ten patients with essential hypertension (EH). The examination on day 1 served as a control for day 2 during which captopril (25 mg) was given orally one hour before measurements of PRC and DTPA clearance. Blood pressure was reduced by captopril in both groups, but the maximum decrease in systolic BP was slightly more pronounced (P less than .01) in RVH (22%, median) than EH (13%). Plasma renin concentration increased to a much greater extent (P less than .01) after captopril in RVH (366%) than in EH (46%), Single kidney 99mTc-DTPA clearance was significantly (P less than .01) reduced (-39.5%) and MTT considerably prolonged (170%) on the affected/most affected side in RVH, but both parameters were only slightly changed or unchanged on the unaffected/least affected side (-6.5%, -2% respectively) and were not significantly changed in any of the sides in EH. The degree of renal artery stenosis was significantly correlated to the increase in PRC (rho = -0.786, n = 14 patients, P less than .01), to the reduction in single kidney 99mTc-DTPA clearance (rho = 0.729, n = 19 kidneys, P less than .01) and to the prolongation in MTT (rho = -0.785, n = 16 kidneys, P less than .01). By analysis of the captopril-induced changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance and MTT, it was possible to predict the existence of a moderate to several renal artery stenosis in arterial hypertension with a very high degree of probability, and the use of changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance and MTT after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may become a valuable tool in differentiation between RVH and EH.\r"

Of 173 identified papers, 16 were specifically selected because they used single dose oral captopril and obtained pre-dose and post-dose peripheral renin levels in at least one patient with renovascular hypertension. These 16 studies were appraised independently by three reviewers using standardized forms for evaluation of diagnostic tests. The 16 studies included 805 patients. All studies involved referred hypertensive populations; detailed demographics and clinical characteristics were not provided. Captopril test procedures varied in all studies. Thirteen of 16 studies used arteriography as a gold standard for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, and three of 16 used surgical outcome data. In ten studies, patients with renovascular hypertension clearly had a significantly greater increase in plasma renin activity than patients with essential hypertension. In the remaining six, plasma renin activity was increased in patients with renovascular hypertension but control comparisons were not made adequately. Existing data suggest that the captopril test may be useful in identifying patients with renovascular hypertension. However, specific clinical recommendations regarding its use cannot be made until future research better defines test cutoff points and identifies which patients are most likely to benefit from the test.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups: normotensive (n = 32), controlled hypertensive (n = 49) and uncontrolled hypertensive group (n = 63). In addition to the difference in their blood pressure status, the three groups had significantly different levels of serum creatinine at entry to the study (mean +/- SE in mg/dL: 1.41 +/- 0.02, 8.89 +/- 0.02 and 2.30 +/- 0.03, respectively, P = .0002). Cumulative graft survival (CGS) at ten years for normotensive patients was 81%, whereas it was 58% for controlled hypertensive patients and 50% for uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The difference of CGS between normotensive and hypertensive patients was significant (P = .01), whereas the difference between the two hypertensive groups, controlled v. uncontrolled, was not. If serum creatinine levels at entry to the study were adjusted and the CGS of hypertensive patients was compared to normotensive patients with comparable levels of serum creatinine, the differences in CGS between the two groups were no longer significant. Regression analyses for potential prognostic factors revealed that serum creatinine levels were of more primary importance as a prognostic variable than blood pressure status. We conclude that hypertension is an important risk factor for renal graft survival, but control of hypertension alone does not appear to improve it. Graft survival appears to be influenced more by the severity of graft dysfunction at entry to the study irrespective of blood pressure control.\r"

  ".W": "During the course of a long-term, prospective, randomized study in 77 hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients, five patients developed evidence suggestive of renal artery stenosis. However, arteriography demonstrated patent renal arteries. The evidence suggestive of renal artery stenosis was: (1) converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI)-induced renal dysfunction including marked and reversible increases in serum creatinine and urea concentrations, (2) minoxidil-induced hyperreninemia despite beta-adrenoceptor blockade and volume expansion, and (3) minoxidil-induced salt and water retention with diuretic resistant edema. Thus, the renal dysfunction induced by CEI in these patients with patent renal arteries is similar to the alterations occurring in patients having bilateral renal artery stenosis. The diuretic resistant edema and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker resistant high renin release are also functional alterations of renal artery stenosis. We suspect that the long-standing and usually severe hypertension in these patients has caused sufficient arteriolar hypertrophy or sclerosis to interfere with renal blood flow and to induce these functional lesions of renal artery stenosis. With widespread use of the new CEI agents in patients with renal disease, this syndrome suggestive of renal artery stenosis may be encountered in as many as 10% of hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients during long-term treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors.\r"

To address the same problem in chronically treated essential hypertensives, we studied 116 uncomplicated essential hypertensives, whose diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg at the end of a two-week placebo run-in period (time 0). According to a randomized crossover design, these patients received three doses (10, 20, or 40 mg) of enalapril qd and a placebo, each treatment being given for one month. At the end of each treatment period as well as at time 0, blood pressure and heart rate were measured 24 hours after the last dosing. In spite of a two-week run-in placebo period, placebo treatment further and significantly reduced blood pressure; however enalapril further and significantly reduced blood pressure when compared to placebo. Although absolute blood pressure values after 40 mg of enalapril were significantly lower than those after 10 mg of enalapril the relevance of this difference, mainly when compared to placebo, seems to be inconsistent. Taken together these data suggest that the hypotensive effect of enalapril chronically given to essential hypertensives and measured 24 hours after last dosing, is dose independent.\r"

The testis also synthesizes renin, as does the anterior pituitary. In contrast, very low levels of renin (ie, below plasma levels) are found in the heart and extrarenal vascular tissues. The predominant form of renin in the human ovary, placenta, and uterus is prorenin and the human ovary, testis, and adrenals have been shown to secrete prorenin into the circulation. The kidney is the only organ that secretes active renin and it is also the major source of plasma prorenin. We have used the ovary as a model to study extrarenal renin. Ovarian prorenin secretion changes dynamically during the menstrual cycle and during gestation. Secretion occurs during the LH surge and when hCG is present in the blood during pregnancy. Plasma active renin does not change concurrently and only low levels of active renin are found in association with very high concentrations of prorenin in ovarian follicular fluid after gonadotropin stimulation. To explain the preponderance of prorenin, and the virtual absence of renin in the ovary we hypothesize that prorenin need not be converted to active renin to have effect. In vitro, when prorenin is acidified to pH 3.3 or cooled to 0 degrees C, it develops intrinsic catalytic activity without cleavage of the prosegment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Human prorenin, secreted from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the cDNA for preprorenin, has been purified in mg quantities by a novel single-step procedure. The method takes advantage of reversible acid activation as a means of generating active prorenin that may be bound and eluted from an affinity column for renin. Analysis of the prorenin so purified revealed that it contained about 80% intact zymogen; the remaining 20% comprised a mixture of various prorenin derivatives truncated in the prosegment, and a small amount of renin. After exposure to 37 degrees C and pH 7.5, the refolded, partially active preparation was passed once more over the affinity column to remove renin and any truncated prorenin forms that were still active and that were, therefore, again retained by the column. Over a period of several hours, refolded and inactive prorenin not bound to the column slowly regains 5% to 10% renin activity, even when maintained under conditions that are optimal for zymogen inactivation. This activity is observed toward both model peptide substrates and natural human angiotensinogen. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which, under physiological conditions, a small amount of open, active prorenin is in equilibrium with a predominant, closed, and inactive form of the zymogen. Support for the model is provided by binding studies with a strong renin inhibitor that displaces the equilibrium entirely to a 1:1 zymogen:inhibitor complex. Limited cleavage of prorenin by several different proteinases has provided a number of fully active renin derivatives with varying N-terminal sequences. Results thus obtained, together with analysis of prorenin and its truncated forms bound, or not bound, to the affinity column under a variety of conditions, suggest that the propeptide region, -Arg-Ile-Phe-Leu-Lys- (positions 10P-14P), is essential for the reversible refolding of the prosegment that leads to zymogen inactivation.\r"

When plasma prorenin rises above the normal range in an adolescent or adult with type 1 diabetes, signs of nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy follow within one to two years. The earliest sign may be intermittent microalbuminuria, which can often be abolished by improved control of hyperglycemia. The association between increased plasma prorenin and complications of noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes is less reliable in patients with hypertension and in those receiving medication that affects plasma prorenin. The oral hypoglycemic agent, glipizide, lowers plasma prorenin, but its effect on prognosis is unknown. Plasma prorenin and renin decline as blood pressure rises, whereas the prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria increases. Many drugs used to control hypertension affect the level of prorenin. In the majority of our patients with type 2 diabetes who are hypertensive or are taking a medication that affects plasma prorenin, microalbuminuria may prove to be a more reliable warning of vascular complications.\r"

The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten behavior toward its two substrates, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ATP, with Km values of 0.42 mumol/L and 0.4 mmol/L, respectively. The presence of other inositol-phosphate metabolizing enzymes in the cytosolic fraction was indicated by the appearance of additional inositol polyphosphates during prolonged incubation with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These included inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate, and inositol pentakisphosphate. These findings are consistent with the rapid phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to the 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent 3-kinase, and its subsequent conversion to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate and thence to inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate in angiotensin-stimulated bovine glomerulosa cells. The formation of inositol pentakisphosphate during prolonged incubations suggests that inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate is slowly phosphorylated and serves as a source of inositol pentakisphosphate in the adrenal. The metabolic conversion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to several higher inositol polyphosphates provides potential new messengers for intracellular regulation in agonist-stimulated target cells.\r"

  ".W": "The development of recombinant DNA technology has introduced new directions for the study of the angiotensinogen molecule. The cloning and sequencing of the human and rat cDNAs demonstrate the similarity of angiotensinogen to various serine protease inhibitors produced by the liver and was the beginning of studies looking for new physiological roles of angiotensinogen, in addition to the substrate for renin. The determination of the nucleotide sequence of these cDNAs also allowed the identification of angiotensinogen mRNA in many tissues in addition to the liver that is the major site of synthesis. This multilocalization of angiotensinogen is one of the arguments for the presence and the function of local renin-angiotensin systems. Finally, the hepatic biosynthesis of angiotensinogen is regulated by many different hormonal factors including glucocorticoid, estrogen, thyroid hormone, insulin, and angiotensin II. The cloning of the angiotensinogen gene offers the opportunity to study this regulation at the transcriptional level. We present in this paper a review of the literature concerning the new aspects of angiotensinogen using molecular biological tools and its regulation together with the characterization of the human angiotensinogen gene.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated the presence of six active forms of renin in rats, based on their isoelectric points (pI). Intravenous or intraventricular injections yielded different renal effects with the different forms. Additional work is presented supporting the hypothesis that these forms are functionally different. Renin form 2 (pI = 5.7), form 4 (pI = 5.2) or form 6 (pI = 4.8) was infused intravenously (IV) in Spague-Dawley rats. The total renin infused over 30 minutes was the amount that could generate 1000 ng angiotensin I (Ang I)/h/100g body weight. Arterial blood pressure, urine volume, sodium, and potassium excretion were determined at 15-minute intervals. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentrations were measured 45 minutes after the start of infusion of renin forms. Infusion of renin form 4 increased urine volume and sodium excretion significantly. Renin forms 2 and 6 were without effect on renal excretion in spite of the fact that the same activity was infused. Both PRA and aldosterone concentrations after renin infusions were similar for all groups. Nonrenin renal protein with the same pI as form 4 was used as a control. This preparation was inactive and implies that our data with renin form 4 were not the result of contamination with a nonrenin protein having a pI of 5.2. In addition, the urinary responses could not be attributable to change in renal perfusion pressure as arterial blood pressure was not altered. These data support the hypothesis that there are functional differences among the different renin forms.\r"

Serum samples from patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) provided antibodies for ADCC. The effector cells were lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy human donors. The SCC cell lines served as targets. Lysis of SCC, as measured by 51Cr release, was significantly enhanced by the presence of serum from patients with PV, but not by healthy human serum. Serum alone produced no target cell killing. Nonepithelial cell lines were not affected by the presence of PV antibodies. The results demonstrate that SCC is susceptible to ADCC. Thus, tumor-specific antibodies may have a role in the treatment of cancer of the head and neck. This system can serve as a positive control for further testing of ADCC against SCC.\r"

Furthermore, the value of ultrasound examination, combined with cytologic examination, of neck nodes was evaluated. Ultrasound examination was characterized by high sensitivity, ie, 96.8%; specificity was 32.0%. When the results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy were added to the ultrasound findings, specificity was as high as 92.9%. From these results, it was concluded that ultrasound examination with fine-needle aspiration biopsy is an accurate method for assessment of the neck in head and neck oncology.\r"

Among the 52 patients who completed the study, there were 17 complete responses (33%), 28 partial responses (54%), five patients with no change (10%), and two with progressive disease (4%). Toxic side effects of all courses summed together included leukopenia in 65% of courses, thrombocytopenia in 45% of courses, nausea or vomiting in 29% of courses, and change in serum creatinine level in 3% of courses. These data were compared with the results of our study with cisplatin and fluorouracil in comparable patients and indicated that carboplatin and fluorouracil is better for induction chemotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer than cisplatin and fluorouracil due to similar effectiveness but less toxic effect.\r"

Twenty FTSGs and 20 PCCGs were harvested from the ears and grafted onto the backs of seven New Zealand white rabbits. The results confirmed that the PCCG provides superior coverage to the FTSGs with regard to thickness, contraction properties, and hair retention.

It is hoped that in addition to adding the 47th case of TA to the literature, this article will provide some insight into the pathogenesis, presentation, and management of this anomaly. It must be emphasized that as TA carries a fatal prognosis, great care must be taken in establishing the diagnosis.

  ".W": "The ability of streptokinase and urokinase to lyse intravascular fibrin-based clots is firmly established. However, there is a lack of enthusiasm for these agents because of serious haemorrhagic complications and a lack of controlled randomized studies indicating their efficacy. Thrombolytic therapy is suitable in only 15 per cent of patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. It restores the venous circulation to normal in up to 95 per cent of these patients if therapy is instituted within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. These patients have significantly fewer symptoms on follow-up than patients treated with heparin although the ability of thrombolytic therapy to preserve venous valvular function and to prevent the post-phlebitic syndrome is now in question. Thrombolytic therapy is as effective as heparin in preventing pulmonary embolism and may be superior in its treatment. Pulmonary haemodynamics are rapidly improved, diffusion capacity is restored and, although the evidence is inconclusive, long-term pulmonary hypertension may be prevented. Although the mortality rate is not decreased, controlled studies show that thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in massive pulmonary embolism with clinical shock. Thrombolytic therapy is indicated for acute arterial and acute bypass graft occlusion when the surgical alternative is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. Partial thrombolysis is achieved in up to 90 per cent of cases and the need for further therapeutic intervention is eliminated in one-third of the patients treated. New thrombolytic agents with greater specificity and potentially greater efficacy and fewer complications are being developed. Tissue plasminogen activator has been successfully used. Prourokinase, fibrin-seeking urokinase and acetylated streptokinase-plasminogen complex may expand the role of thrombolytic therapy in surgical practice.\r"

At a minimum follow-up period of 1 year the overall patency rate was 95.0 per cent with a revision rate of 15.8 per cent. There was no correlation between revision rate and vein complexity or calf vein diameter. Calf vein diameter greater than 2.5 mm was correlated with a successful bypass (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that B-map is the investigation of choice for saphenous vein assessment before infrainguinal bypass surgery.\r"

Over the last 9 years at St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK, we have managed severe acute pancreatitis by intensive supportive therapy followed by sub-total pancreatic resection and/or debridement in those who fail to improve. Of the 22 patients who have undergone this form of surgery, nine were found to have colonic involvement in the form of either necrosis or perforation. In addition, one patient presenting at West Middlesex University Hospital, Isleworth, UK, had severe acute pancreatitis and almost total colonic necrosis as an unexpected finding at emergency laparotomy. These ten patients comprised seven men and three women of median age 59 years and with a median of four Ranson criteria. In seven patients, colonic involvement was discovered at the time of pancreatic surgery or laparotomy for pancreatitis and in the remainder it presented between 1 and 3 weeks later as either a faecal fistula (n = 2) or persistent abdominal sepsis (n = 1). The ascending colon was involved in one patient, the splenic flexure and descending colon in one, the transverse colon in three, the splenic flexure alone in four, and one patient had almost total colonic involvement. All patients underwent resection of the involved colon and exteriorization with either a proximal colostomy (n = 7) or ileostomy (n = 3) and a distal mucous fistula. Pathological examination of the resected colons revealed a spectrum of changes from pericolitis through to ischaemic necrosis suggesting at least two possible mechanisms. Six patients died from overwhelming sepsis between 1 day and 4 weeks (median 11 days) after colonic resection. Severe acute pancreatitis must be recognized as a cause of colonic ischaemia and necrosis; this complication is associated with a very poor prognosis despite surgical intervention.\r"

In a longitudinal analysis of the first 4 postoperative days, lavage did not show any advantage over drainage, as measured by seven prognostic signs (serum creatinine, blood glucose, base excess, haematocrit, white blood cells, C-reactive protein and immunoreactive phospholipase A2 concentration). Furthermore, the study did not find that lavage had any positive effect on the incidence of mortality (36 versus 17 per cent in the drainage group) or on septic complications in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. In the total series the extent of pancreatic necrosis was an essential predictor of the outcome.\r"

We interpret our results to indicate that the survival of intermingled grafts is dependent upon an as yet undefined local protective effect exerted by the presence of auto-skin islands in the allotypic portion of intermingled grafts.\r"

Graft survival is not disturbed by stools or gently wiping of the wound to remove stools, as grafts are buried in the holes. If infection occurs soon after the operation, graft survival does not appear to be affected because the grafted holes show good drainage. This procedure is considered to be very useful for treating perianal or perineal granulating wounds in extensively and deeply burned patients who have limited autograft donor sites.\r"

Heat causes an increase in dermal thickness of between 50 and 100 per cent for the period between 1 and 6 h after injury. Identifying the layers corresponding to the histological slides makes it is possible to measure the distance between the interfaces. This improves the quantitative assessment of both the depth and the area of thermal injury.\r"

Sequence analysis showed that the trial could finish when eight patients had been treated. The Duoderm dressing resulted in solid re-epithelialization almost 3 days earlier than Omiderm, and it was more comfortable for the patients.

Two basic types of instrument are available: generic instruments, which include health profiles and utility measurements based on the patient's preferences in regard to treatment and outcome; and specific instruments, which focus on problems associated with individual diseases, patient groups or areas of function. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive; each has its strengths and weaknesses and may be suitable under different circumstances. We surveyed 75 randomized trials published in three medical journals in 1986 and categorized them according to the importance of quality of life as a measure of outcome and the extent to which quality of life was actually measured. Although a number of the investigators used quality-of-life instruments in a sophisticated manner, in only 10 of 55 trials in which the measurement had been judged to be crucial or important were instruments with established validity and responsiveness used. We conclude that although accurate measurement of quality of life in randomized trials is now feasible it is still not widely done. Using the framework we have outlined, investigators can choose generic or specific instruments according to the purpose and the focus of their trial.\r"

In 60% of cases either T-cell or B-cell specific antigens were detected on Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Most T-cell cases were of nodular sclerosing (NS) and mixed cellularity (MC) type (65% and 30%, respectively) and most B-cell cases were either of NS or lymphocyte predominant (LP) type (55% and 45%, respectively). Leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was usually negative on RS cells in NS, but was present in approximately 50% of the cases of MC and LP types. Almost all cases were positive for the CD30 antigen (Ki-1). Most cases were also positive for CD15 (LeuM1) with the exception of the LP type. Activation antigens (Ia, CD25, T9) were expressed in a high proportion of cases regardless of subtype. The results suggest that most cases of HD are histogenetically derived from activated T-cells or B-cells.\r"

Affinity absorption of the antibody with N-acetyl-galactosamine but not with N-acetylglucosamine or d-galactose effectively removed the lymphoma reactive antibodies. Soy bean agglutinin but not wheat germ agglutinin demonstrated lectin activity towards an epitope on the lymphoma membrane. Finally, digestion of cryostat sections of the lymphoma with N-acetylgalactosaminidase effectively removed the sugar epitope involved in EMA marking. Such data taken together would tend to indicate a membrane positioned complex carbohydrate with galactosamine dominancy. By analogy to the purported \"late differentiation antigen secretory function\" of EMA this lymphoma may be close to plasma cell stage.\r"

Overall, 55% of the carcinomas studied stained positively for GCDFP-15. In certain histologic subtypes, the percentage of carcinomas that stained positively was greater: those subtypes with apocrine histologic features (75%), intraductal carcinoma (70%), and infiltrating lobular carcinoma with signet-ring cell differentiation (90%). In contrast, only 5% of medullary carcinomas exhibited positive staining. Only 23% of breast carcinomas without apocrine features stained positively for GCDFP-15. Carcinomas that stained positively were more likely to have involved axillary lymph nodes (P less than 0.054). The staining was independent of nuclear grade, mitotic index, tumor size, and estrogen receptor status. Positive staining was related to a history of gross cystic disease but not to age, parity, menopausal status, or age at first birth. A positive stain was not related to risk of recurrence or survival.\r"

The clinical data for the seven patients with hepatoblastoma were also reviewed. The ratio of fucosylation of AFP was significantly higher in all seven patients with hepatoblastoma, whereas it was minimal in all other cases of benign hepatic conditions such as neonatal hepatitis or biliary atresia, as well as in normal newborns. The ratio of fucosylation in hepatoblastoma, however, definitely decreased with the age of the patient at presentation. This finding suggests a correlation between fucosylation and a rapid rate of tumor growth, because all hepatoblastomas are believed to originate early in fetal life.\r"

Transformation of cells from the normal to the malignant phenotype in experimental studies has been associated with point mutations within the coding region for these ras proteins. Recent reports demonstrate that 40% of human colon cancers and 20% of acute leukemias contain ras mutations in the twelfth or thirteenth codon that can result in amino acid substitutions at these positions in the p21 products. Similarly, studies of ras mRNA detected 40% of human colon tumors with twelfth codon c-Ki-ras mutant mRNA. The authors previously developed a nonradioactive double-antibody enzyme-linked immunoblot assay (ELIBA) for detection of normal and mutant ras p21. They have adapted that technology to specifically detect twelfth codon activated ras p21 utilizing mutation-specific antisera. In this report the authors show that one of seven de novo human bladder cancers and four of seven colon cancers express a twelfth codon activated ras p21. These results document that mutations at both the DNA and mRNA levels are ultimately translated into an abnormal protein product present in human tumors.\r"

  ".U": "89248806\r", 
  ".W": "From July 1958 to June 1978, a total of 333 cases with pathologically proven primary liver cancer (PLC) were admitted to the Zhong Shan Hospital, Shanghai Medical University, Shanghai, the people's Republic of China. Of these, 39.6% (132 of 333) were resected and 14.4% (19 of 132) survived over 10 years after resection for PLC. These 19 patients surviving over 10 years were investigated in this paper. All 19 patients underwent radical resection, including right hemihepatectomy in two cases, left hemihepatectomy in ten cases, left lateral segmentectomy in three cases, and local resection in four cases. By the end of June 1988, follow-up varied from 10 years and 1 month to 26 years and 7 months, with a mean follow-up of 15 years and 4 months. All 19 patients are still alive with free of disease. The longest survival patient had a tumor measuring 10 X 8 X 6 cm in size and underwent local resection. Upon follow-up after 26 years and 7 months, the patient was found to be still living and well. Two patients with intraperitoneal ruptured PLC have survived for 19 years and 4 months, and 16 years and 11 months, respectively, after resection of the tumors free of disease and have returned to work. Subclinical recurrence of PLC was discovered in one patient in whom reoperation with cryosurgery was carried out. The patient has been in good condition with negative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for 8 years and 10 months after cryosurgery. Subclinical solitary pulmonary metastasis was detected in two patients because of a secondary rise in AFP level. Reoperations were carried out and the metastatic tumors were removed. These two patients are still in good health with negative AFP 9 years and 6 months, and 10 years and 1 months, respectively, after reoperation. These results indicate that early and radical resection are the principal factors influencing long-term survival; reoperation for subclinical recurrence and solitary metastasis remains an important approach to prolong survival further; intraperitoneal rupture of PLC does not exclude the possibility of cure; new surgical techniques, such as cryosurgery and bloodless hepatectomy, have been shown to be effective in some patients.\r"

In this prospective study, its reactivity was tested on the ABC from 25 breast lesions interpreted as suspicious. The stain was applied directly to the Papanicolaou-stained specimen by the avidin-biotin peroxidase methodology at a concentration of 40 micrograms/ml. In 11 aspirates from invasive carcinomas, the reactivity to MoAb B72.3 was strongly positive in nine cases and weakly positive in two. Ten of these tumors were homogeneous or heterogeneous infiltrating lobular neoplasms, tumors causing special diagnostic pitfalls by ABC. The cells from seven of the nine benign lesions were nonreactive, and in two cases from fibrocystic change, weakly reactive. The ABC from five patients with noninvasive carcinomas or atypical lobular hyperplasia showed a variety of responses. The findings indicate that in select circumstances, MoAb B72.3 used in conjunction with clinical and cytologic findings may be a useful diagnostic adjunct.\r"

The medical factors include a lack of knowledge on the part of health care professionals regarding the rational use of opioid drugs. This is coupled with real limitations in the general understanding of the mechanisms of pain and its treatment using pharmacologic, anesthetic, and neurosurgical approaches. Several pharmacologic controversies, including the choice of drug, route and method of administration, and tolerance development and risk of substance abuse, have emerged with the use of opioids on a chronic basis in the cancer population. The social and moral implications involve the issue of who will pay for high technology pain management approaches for patients either at home or in hospice care and the ethical considerations in managing pain with opioid drugs. Carefully designed studies to assess these factors, coupled with broad educational programs, will improve the care of cancer patients in pain and expand our understanding of these important issues.\r"

Somatic and visceral pain result from activation of nociceptors by tumor infiltration of tissues and from secondary inflammatory changes with release of algesic chemicals that act to sensitize nociceptors. Pain may be experienced locally (somatic and visceral) or referred to remote cutaneous sites (visceral). Deafferentation pain results from injury to the nervous system due to tumor infiltration or cancer therapy and may persist even after the cause of the injury has been removed. Somatic, visceral, and deafferentation pain may be complicated by sympathetically maintained pain, in which efferent sympathetic activity promotes persistent pain, hyperpathia, and vasomotor and sudomotor changes after tissue injury from cancer or its therapy. The neurobiology of cancer pain is complex and incompletely understood. This article summarizes current knowledge in this area and briefly discusses approaches to cancer pain management that are based on this knowledge.\r"

An increased incidence of psychiatric disturbance, in particular, anxiety and depression, is found in patients with pain. Psychiatric symptoms in patients with cancer pain must be initially viewed as a consequence of uncontrolled pain. Personality factors may be quite distorted by the presence of pain, and its relief often results in the disappearance of a perceived psychiatric disorder. Reassessment after pain control is imperative. Optimal treatment of cancer pain includes pharmacologic, psychologic, behavioral, anesthetic, stimulatory, and rehabilitative approaches, often in combination. Cognitive and behavioral interventions, such as relaxation, imagery, hypnosis, distraction, and biofeedback, are effective as part of a comprehensive multimodal approach and must never be used as a substitute for appropriate analgesic management of cancer pain. Psychotropic drugs, particularly the tricyclic antidepressants, are useful as adjuvant analgesic agents in the pharmacologic management of cancer pain.\r"

Anesthetic procedures are desirable when they will not compromise bodily functions important to the patient, and when tumor-directed therapy and noninvasive or less-invasive, low-risk approaches (primarily pharmacologic tailoring of analgesic drugs) fail to control pain. Nondestructive techniques include the epidural/intrathecal use of opioids via an implanted catheter, and local anesthetic blocks of nerves and sympathetic ganglia. Chronic intrathecal or epidural opioid infusion seems ideal if the life expectancy is 2 to 3 months. Local anesthetic blocks can help prognosticate results of subsequent neurolytic blocks, including undesirable effects. Destructive anesthetic procedures comprise injections of neurolytic agents (most commonly phenol or alcohol), and insertion of freezing probes, into nerves and ganglia. The types of nerve blocks performed, their complications, and success rates, and limitations of commonly used neurolytic agents as well as their proper applications, are described. The importance of proper patient selection and knowledge of the pathophysiology of the pain being treated is stressed, as is the appropriate timing of anesthetic procedures in the course of the disease.\r"

Currently, opioid analgesics are the mainstay of pain control, but side effects limit their use in some patients. When pharmacologic pain control is inadequate or associated with intolerable side effects, neurosurgery should be considered. Currently the implantation of a pump for the intraspinal infusion of opioid analgesics is the most popular procedure, but its usefulness may be limited by the development of opioid tolerance. The most effective ablative pain control procedure at the current time is cordotomy, which is indicated in patients with unilateral pain. Although the place of neurostimulatory procedures in controlling cancer pain is not well established, they are attractive because of their nondestructive nature and potential usefulness in the treatment of bilateral pain syndromes. Specific antitumor surgical procedures should be considered in patients with certain spinal and plexopathy syndromes, because such intervention offers the prospect of both pain relief and tumor control. In this article, the neurosurgical procedures used in the management of cancer pain are reviewed.\r"

There are three evaluable published reports of double-blind randomized controlled studies and a number of prospective open studies and retrospective reviews. There are also several published pharmacokinetic studies and substantial accumulated clinical experience with MST since its introduction in the United Kingdom in 1981. A critical review of the evidence indicates that MST is effective in patients with opioid-responsive pain; that for almost all patients twice-daily administration is sufficient; that the potency ratio compared with standard (immediate-release) oral morphine formulations is one to one; and that the side effect profile is similar. An immediate-release morphine preparation is preferable during the dose titration period when frequent dose adjustment may be required. However, once patients have been stabilized MST is much more convenient and simpler to use than conventional morphine elixirs or tablets and is the preferred formulation for maintenance treatment.\r"

In HCG-positive tumors, the presence of human placental lactogen (HPL) and pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein (SP-1) also was assessed. HCG immunoreactive cells were found in nine of the 47 high-grade tumors (19%), whereas none of the low-grade tumors were positive for HCG. This hormone was predominantly detected in the most undifferentiated and pleomorphic areas; however, HCG-positive cells also were found in areas of carcinoma in situ and well-differentiated transitional cell carcinoma in two cases. The serum HCG level was increased in two of the four cases studied. HPL and SP-1 immunoreactive cells were observed in seven and five cases, respectively, and it was found that tumors positive for SP-1 also were positive for HPL. Five tumors, including the two with trophoblastic differentiation, contained the three placental proteins. The HPL and SP-1 immunostained cells were usually found in the same areas of the tumor that were positive for HCG, but there was always a lower number of HPL and SP-1 immunoreactive cells than HCG immunoreactive cells. In one case, HPL and SP-1 could be found in areas of well-differentiated transitional cell carcinoma. These findings suggest that the morphologic and functional trophoblastic differentiation in urothelial carcinomas is a progressive phenomenon evolving from transitional cell carcinomas.\r"

The technique was first studied in a test system in which human or monkey bone marrow was seeded with MCF-7 cells, and was determined to be sensitive enough to detect fewer than one cancer cell in 10(4) hematopoietic cells. An immunoglucose oxidase method was used for patient specimen antibody localization and was found to be free of false-positive staining. Marrow specimens from 25 patients with breast cancer of various stages were examined. No correlation with disease stage was observed.

Although the number of reported cases is small, basaloid-squamous carcinoma appears biologically virulent, with a propensity to aggressive local behavior and early regional and distant metastasis, and subsequent poor survival. The authors add a further case of basaloid-squamous carcinoma to the world literature.\r"

A review of the literature on DGP indicates that this case represents the youngest patient and is the second case of DGP with metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilament (NF), pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin showed positive results for epithelioid and ganglion-like cells, whereas spindle cells showed immunoreactivities for S-100 protein, NSE, and NF. The histogenesis of DGP is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has a broad spectrum of responsibilities that range from support of basic laboratory research to the clinical testing of new therapeutics and, finally, the dissemination of results of this research to the practicing physician and the public. The reduction of cancer mortality is largely dependent on the responsibility for widespread application of state-of-the-art cancer treatments. A major cancer control focus of the NCI over the last decade has been the development and implementation of programs designed to improve awareness, access and application of state-of-the-art cancer treatment. In addition to the computerized Physician Data Query system, three targeted programs, the Cooperative Group Outreach Program (CGOP), the Community Hospital Oncology Program (CHOP), and the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) have all been aimed at establishing mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of new patient care technology; and, thereby, provide the highest quality cancer treatment in the community setting. An evaluation was conducted to determine if patterns and outcomes of cancer care management changed over time, and whether this could be related to the presence of CGOP, CHOP, and CCOP. Measurement of required program implementation was relatively straightforward. However, measurement of resultant changes in \"quality of care\" and the factors that influence physician performance are complex and controversial. Critical elements in the treatment of breast, colon, rectum, and small cell lung cancer were used as tracers to measure changes in the patterns of care in communities where programs were implemented. Results from this study highlight issues in state-of-the-art assessment of quality, such as the difficulty in defining quality cancer care, relationships between process and outcome indicators, and the problems of documentation and missing data. Assurance of quality cancer care requires the interaction of health care professionals with knowledge of the most up-to-date cancer research results working in a health care delivery system that encourages and rewards application of these results.\r"

However, intraoperative changes in extravascular lung water (EVLW) have not been studied. Nine patients undergoing elective surgery, either aortic aneurysm repair or aorto-bifemoral grafting, were monitored invasively with arterial lines, pulmonary artery catheters and Edwards lung water catheters inserted in either the brachial or axillary artery. Determinations of EVLW were made prior to and five minutes after application of the aortic cross-clamp and at 30-minute intervals during the course of the operation. Baseline EVLW was found to be 7-9 ml.kg-1. There were no significant changes in haemodynamic variables and no changes in EVLW with cross-clamping of the aorta. The EVLW did not change during the course of surgery. The EVLW did not increase in the absence of sustained elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. One patient developed an axillary artery thrombosis which required thrombectomy at the site of lung water catheter insertion. Two other patients lost their distal pulses without overt ischaemic changes. It was felt that such relatively high incidence of complications precluded further use of the lung water catheter in the axillary or brachial artery.\r"

Patients presenting for hip fracture surgery have a high prevalence of preoperative medical problems and may require medical stabilization before surgery. Regional anaesthesia for hip fracture repair may be contraindicated due to perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis. The use of regional anaesthesia increases the magnitude and frequency of hypotensive episodes when compared with general anaesthesia. Intraoperative blood losses, averaging 250-300 ml, are not affected by anaesthetic technique. Following hip fracture surgery under spinal anaesthesia, patients exhibit better oxygenation in the early postoperative period than those after general anaesthesia. The frequency of postoperative confusion is unrelated to anaesthetic technique. The incidence of deep venous thrombosis is reduced following spinal anaesthesia as compared with general anaesthesia. The one-month mortality rate, approximately eight per cent, is unrelated to anaesthetic technique. Spinal, epidural and general anaesthesia have been used successfully for total hip arthroplasty. Intraoperative blood loss of 0.5-1.5 litres is reduced with regional anaesthesia. General anaesthesia with controlled hypotension also significantly reduces blood loss. Intraoperative instability with hypoxaemia, hypotension and cardiac arrest may follow impaction of the femoral prosthesis and are related to absorption of acrylic cement monomers and pulmonary embolism of fat, air, and platelet-fibrin aggregates. Postoperative deep venous thrombosis is common and the incidence may be reduced with epidural anaesthesia. Operative mortality is less than one per cent and pulmonary embolism is the commonest cause of death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred and twenty-nine adverse reactions were reported as disturbing and possibly drug-related. Profound bradycardia or sinus arrest was reported in four cases and disturbing hypotension in 37.

This is like saying, \"If a little epinephrine is good, more is better.\" That is wrong in the use of epinephrine and it can be wrong with too much testing. Worse than wasteful, I believe this extra testing is causing iatrogenic disease by pursuit and treatment of borderline and false-positive test results. It is increasing our medicolegal risk and decreasing the efficiency of practice. Fortunately, this history of too much testing can now be turned to our advantage. It provides an arena where we can demonstrate to our constituency, the patient, and our watchdog, the bureaucrat, that we can use inexpensive technology to reduce costs substantially and improve the quality of care.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of stimulation of the cervical sympathetic ganglia on the upper limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation was studied in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following intravenous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 mg/kg). CBF was measured using the intracarotid 133Xe injection method in halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthetized WKY and SHR. Arterial blood pressure was raised stepwise by the intravenous infusion of noradrenaline. Toward the end of the study, Evans blue was injected and the brains examined for gross blood-brain barrier breakdown. In SHR, sympathetic stimulation reextended the upper limit of CBF autoregulation, which was at a mean arterial blood pressure level of 120-139 mm Hg in the control group of eight SHR and above 170 mm Hg in the stimulated group of nine SHR. In the group of nine WKY subjected to sympathetic stimulation, the upper limit of CBF autoregulation was reached at a mean arterial blood pressure level of 110-129 mm Hg as opposed to 90-109 mm Hg in a previous unstimulated group of WKY. In the two groups subjected to sympathetic stimulation, there was no extravasation of Evans blue in any of the brains. In the control group of SHR, in which there had been marked increases in CBF, three out of eight brains had foci with extravasation of the dye. It is concluded that in normotensive and in hypertensive rats sympathetic stimulation attenuates the downward shift of the upper limit of CBF autoregulation, which is known to accompany intravenous administration of captopril.\r"

We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites in intact tissue slices to determine whether the total tissue content of receptors is reduced and to characterize the transmural distribution of receptors in cardiac myocytes and the coronary vasculature in hearts obtained from nine cardiac transplant patients with severe congestive failure. Binding of [125Iodo]cyanopindolol to transmural slices of human myocardium was rapid, saturable, stereoselective, and displaceable by agonists and antagonists with an appropriate rank order of potency. Binding isotherms in four normal and nine failing ventricles showed a significant reduction in the total tissue content of beta-receptors in failing myocardium (38.3 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein) compared with normal tissue (52.4 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein, p = 0.038). In the normal ventricles, the greatest receptor density was observed autoradiographically in myocytic regions of the subendocardium. Receptor density of the coronary arterioles was approximately 70% of that in adjacent myocytic regions. The density of binding sites in both myocytic regions and arterioles was diminished in all regions of the failing ventricles, but down-regulation was due primarily to a selective reduction of beta-receptors of subendocardial myocytes (63 +/- 5% of subepicardial receptor density vs. 115 +/- 6% in controls, p less than 0.0001). These observations indicate that down-regulation occurs nonuniformly in the transmural distribution and thus is likely not related simply to elevated circulating catecholamine levels.\r"

We describe here the methodology of the trial and data regarding enrollment of patients in the trial. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether electrophysiologic study or electrocardiographic Holter monitoring more accurately predicts antiarrhythmic drug efficacy in patients with aborted sudden death or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Consenting patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and at least 480 premature ventricular contractions during 48 hours are randomized to undergo antiarrhythmic drug selection either by electrophysiologic study or by Holter monitoring. Up to six drugs (mexiletine, pirmenol, procainamide, propafenone, quinidine, and sotalol) are assessed in random order until one is predicted effective. An efficacy prediction is achieved in the electrophysiology limb if ventricular tachyarrhythmias are no longer inducible and in the Holter limb if ventricular ectopy is largely suppressed. Patients in whom a drug is predicted effective are followed while they are taking that drug to detect one of the three primary endpoints: arrhythmia recurrence, sudden death, or unmonitored syncope. In the first 37 months, 967 patients satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria to undergo baseline studies. Two hundred eighty-six were eligible for and consented to randomization. In total, approximately 500 patients will be randomized and 285 subjects will be followed while receiving drugs that are predicted effective in this trial. Approximately 70 patients are expected to attain a primary end-point during a mean follow-up ot 3 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Restenosis after successful PTCA remains a major problem limiting the efficacy of the procedure. The pathophysiologic mechanism of restenosis has been enigmatic so far, but accumulated evidence strongly suggests that intimal hyperplasia is the major mechanism. Based on current understanding of the process of intimal hyperplasia, one unifying concept may be that there are at least two major local biologic determinants influencing this process, lesion characteristics and regional flow dynamics. Lesion characteristics include the plaque structure and the quantity of smooth muscle. These may provide the anatomic substrate that determines the extent of injury and the degree of smooth muscle cell proliferation. The amount of smooth muscle cells in the stenotic lesion activated by injury to undergo proliferation may determine the eventual bulk of the restenotic lesion. In addition, low wall shear stress could promote intimal hyperplasia and cause structural change of vessels to decrease the lumen, whereas high wall shear stress exerts the opposite effects. Intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury is a complex process involving platelets, growth factors, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mechanical injury, wall shear stress, and probably other unknown factors. Platelets not only contribute growth factors such as PDGF but also cause organized thrombus. Different growth factors may be involved in initiating smooth muscle cell proliferation and may come from many different sources, including smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Intact confluent endothelial cells may produce heparin sulfates and inhibit intimal proliferation; however, regenerating endothelial cells may have the opposite effect. Thus, the proliferative potential of smooth muscle cells, endothelial recovery, extent of injury, wall shear stress, and other unknown factors may all influence this process. Based on these concepts concerning the biology of restenosis, some research directions concerning potential forms of therapy are proposed.\r"

Based on analysis of available data, efforts to improve results might be directed toward a more general application of mitral valve reconstruction in this population. Other promising therapeutic measures include the liberal use of reperfusion therapy in the acute papillary muscle dysfunction group, better selection of patients for operation, and, perhaps, operative recommendation to a greater proportion of the more stable patients who previously were treated medically. Incorporating these therapeutic concepts into routine clinical practice may improve the overall prognosis of this difficult subgroup.\r"

Probable incremental risk factors include emergency operation, acute myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, poor left ventricular function, pulmonary hypertension, advanced age, and renal failure. Early valve repair or replacement with myocardial revascularization improves survival in patients with circulatory insufficiency due to acute postinfarction mitral regurgitation. Although the technique of repair of nonacute ischemic mitral insufficiency is not standardized, repair with revascularization is preferred. Preliminary data suggest that long-term results are primarily related to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

If cardiac damage is overwhelming and irreversible, selected patients may be \"bridged\" with mechanical biventricular circulatory assist devices and transplanted. Infarctectomy for acute myocardial infarction remains controversial and unproven; successful repair of free left ventricular wall rupture is uncommon. In patients with cardiogenic shock, operations for acute postinfarction ventricular septal defect or mitral insufficiency have operative survival rates of 45% and 54%, respectively. Long-term (greater than 2-year) survival for patients after repair of acute postinfarction ventricular septal defect is 84%. However, 5-year survival after successful operation for acute postinfarction mitral insufficiency complicated by cardiogenic shock is only 40%.\r"

Acute failure of coronary angioplasty led to emergency operation in 701 patients with 25 (3.6%) deaths. There was a 37.6% incidence of perioperative infarction. Thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, sometimes followed by angioplasty, led to emergency operation within 8 hours in 145 instances with four (2.1%) deaths. Emergency coronary bypass was primary therapy for 1,051 patients with acute myocardial infarction with 51 (4.9%) hospital deaths. Emergency operation for failed angioplasty is frequently mandated in the setting of surgical standby and iatrogenic ischemia although some operations could be postponed to an elective status. Emergency operation after thrombolytic therapy has been used for unsuccessful angioplasty of the infarct vessel, left main stenosis of greater than 50%, left main equivalent, multivessel disease with complex lesions not amenable to angioplasty, or failure to restore patency of the infarct vessel with thrombolysis. Operation within 12 hours of thrombolytic therapy is associated with a coagulopathy causing increased bleeding, the need for transfusion, and a greater incidence of reoperation for perioperative bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "Compared with isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the combination of valve replacement or repair with coronary revascularization generally increases operative risk. However, complete revascularization is superior to no revascularization in patients with valvular and coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients who undergo aortic valve replacement and CABG have two unrelated disease processes; these patients only infrequently have ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the operative mortality is slightly increased to 4-7% for the combined procedure versus isolated aortic valve replacement. Patients who are operated on for mitral valve disease and CAD fall into two groups: 1) where CAD and mitral valve disease are not etiologically related, and 2) where mitral valve dysfunction is the result of ischemic changes. In the latter group, operative mortality significantly exceeds that for isolated mitral valve surgery, and surgical priority increases that difference (operative mortality 7-20%). Thus, the operative risk for a mitral valve procedure plus CABG exceeds that for isolated coronary revascularization or isolated valve replacement. In the combined procedure, risk increases if valve dysfunction is caused by CAD, if severe left ventricular function is present, if the patient has been assigned to Class IV, or if emergency operation is required.\r"

Subsequently, this rate doubles, so that at 10 years, approximately 50% of grafts become occluded due to the occurrence of graft atherosclerosis. A similar percentage of patent grafts show atherosclerotic changes at the end of the 1st decade. Sequential vein grafts probably suffer the same fate although late follow-up is lacking. Reoperation is estimated to be 30% at 10 years, as judged by angiographic criteria. The operative risk of reoperation is at least double that of primary operation; symptomatic relief appears to be of shorter duration. Recent technical changes to better preserve medial and endothelial function and to pharmacologically inhibit platelet function may lead to longer duration of the venous conduit.\r"

ITA grafts can be used for up to 70% of all distal anastomoses and in up to 95% of patients. ITA grafts are more technically demanding; inadequate length, traumatic arterial injury, torsion, separation of intima and adventitia, and anastomotic stricture are important pitfalls. Postoperative problems of bleeding, phrenic nerve injury, mediastinal infection, and arm paresis or paresthesia are complications attributed to ITA grafts, but they are uncommon if meticulous technique is used.\r"

  ".W": "Over the last 20 years, operative mortality has decreased and late survival has improved for patients with chronic stable angina who have coronary artery bypass surgery. However, this favorable trend may not continue because the operation is now extended to elderly and high-risk patients. The most powerful predictors of operative mortality include indexes of left ventricular function, age, and the number of associated medical conditions. Female gender, severity of angina, and extent of coronary artery disease appear to be predictors of operative mortality in some series but not in all. Indexes of left ventricular dysfunction remain the most powerful predictors of late death, but the extent of coronary disease, older age, and presence of associated diseases (including noncardiac vascular disease) remain important determinants. Analyses of the randomized trials and registry studies reveal a consistent trend: in patients at high risk on the basis of clinical, functional, and anatomic characteristics, coronary artery bypass surgery prolongs survival in comparison with medical therapy alone. In patients determined to be at low risk, medical therapy is initially recommended with the realization that revascularization may be necessary subsequently if symptoms worsen or the severity of ischemia increases.\r"
