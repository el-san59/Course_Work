  ".W": "The populations of New Haven and Boston are demographically similar and receive most of their hospital care in university hospitals, but in 1982 their expenditures per head for inpatient care were $451 and $889, respectively. The 685,400 residents of Boston incurred about $300 million more in hospital expenditures and used 739 more beds than they would have if the use rates for New Haven residents had applied. Most of the extra beds were invested in higher admission rates for medical conditions in which the decision to admit can be discretionary. The overall rates for major surgery were equal, but rates for some individual operations varied widely. These findings indicate that academic standards of care are compatible with widely varying patterns of practice and that medical care costs are not necessarily high in communities served largely by university hospitals. They also emphasise the need for increased attention to the outcome and cost implications of differences in practice styles.\r"

  ".W": "In 40,635 deliveries in 1978-85, unexplained stillbirths were an important component (nearly a quarter) of all perinatal deaths. The rate of unexplained stillbirth (unexplained stillbirths divided by total births) was highest among preterm deliveries, fell to a minimum at 39-40 weeks' gestation, then rose at 41-42 weeks. Rate is generally accepted as measuring risk, but since it is the population of undelivered, not delivered, infants that is at risk of intrauterine death, stillbirth risk would be better measured as the number of impending stillbirths divided by the total number of undelivered fetuses. With this measure the risk of unexplained stillbirth was least in preterm pregnancies, rising fourfold after 39 weeks to a maximum at 41 weeks. At this time, it was also four times higher than at 33 weeks, in contrast to the rate, which was nineteen times lower.\r"

  ".U": "87201890\r", 
  ".W": "Degradation of intracellular proteins through the ubiquitin and ATP-dependent proteolysis pathway involves several steps. Initially, ubiquitin is covalently linked to the proteolytic substrate in an ATP-requiring reaction. Proteins marked by ubiquitin may then be selectively lysed in a reaction that also requires ATP (for reviews see refs 1-3). A major question concerns the structural features of a protein that make it a specific substrate for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. It was shown that a free alpha-NH2 group is one important feature of the protein structure recognized by the ubiquitin ligation system, and that the half-life in vivo of a protein with an exposed amino terminus depends on its amino terminal residue. We have previously demonstrated that transfer RNA (tRNA) is essential for conjugation of ubiquitin and for the subsequent degradation of proteins with acidic amino termini (aspartate or glutamate). We now show that tRNA is required for post-translational conjugation of arginine to acidic amino termini of proteins, a modification that is essential for their degradation by the ubiquitin pathway.\r"

Vaccination with TSA or anti-idiotypic (TSA) antibodies has also been used to control tumour growth in model systems. An effective immune response nevertheless demands copresentation of antigen with host histocompatibility determinants. We therefore examined whether live vaccinia virus recombinants expressing TSA in cells of the vaccinated host might better elicit tumour immunity. Polyoma virus (PY) is tumorigenic in rodents; because killed PY-transformed cells can elicit tumour immunity, a PY-specific TSA has been postulated. Tumorigenesis involves expression of three early PY proteins, large-T (LT), middle-T (MT) and small-T (ST), but their role as TSAs is unclear. We therefore expressed the three T proteins in separate vaccinia recombinants. Rejection of PY tumours was observed in rats immunized with recombinants expressing either LT or MT. Further, tumour-bearing animals could be induced to reject their tumours by inoculation of recombinants.\r"

  ".W": "The continuing discovery and development of beta-lactams as antibiotics has had an unparalleled impact on the overall health and well-being of society. Recently, appropriately substituted cephalosporins were shown to be potent inhibitors of elastase, suggesting a novel therapeutic role for the beta-lactams in the control of emphysema and other degenerative diseases. We have now solved and partially refined at atomic resolution the structure of a complex of porcine pancreatic elastase with the time-dependent irreversible inhibitor 3-acetoxymethyl-7-alpha-chloro-3-cephem-4-carboxylate-1,1-dioxide tert-butyl ester (I), the most potent of the beta-lactam elastase inhibitors yet reported. (Porcine pancreatic elastase is a close relative of the desired drug target, human polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase.) A mechanism of action is presented, based on the structure and on biochemical evidence (T.-Y.L. et al., in preparation), which clarifies the operational similarities and differences between beta-lactam elastase inhibitors and antibiotics. Features of the reaction include the expulsion of a leaving group at the cephalosporin 3' position and the formation of two covalent bonds with the active site of porcine pancreatic elastase at residues Ser 195 and His 57.\r"

Bandura's (1977) social learning theory and the relationship between control and stress formed the theoretical framework; Q methodology was central to implementation and replication of the descriptive design. Consistent with Q methodology, major and replication samples were purposively selected, each consisting of 30 medical-surgical inpatients of both sexes, ranging from 24 to 75 years of age. Instruments used were the Client Control Q Set, Health Opinion Survey (HOS), a demographic data form, and a semi-structured interview. Q factor analysis and the construction of factor arrays resulted in three dimensions of client control in the original data set which replicated and were supported by interview and HOS data. These orthogonal dimensions were: knowing and fulfilling the patient role, being involved in making decisions, and directing interpersonal and environmental components. A theme common to all dimensions was the importance patients attached to having cognitive control over diagnostic tests, surgery, and treatment and to understanding concomitant life-style implications. Identification of the kinds of people who find control in various ways remains elusive, although patients hospitalized for diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer were predominant among those who wanted to be involved in making decisions.\r"

From this perspective, a person's appraisal or evaluation of stress and one's coping modes are determined by both personal and situational factors specific to the individual. Children were interviewed preoperatively and rated as using avoidance modes, active modes, or a combination of avoidance-active coping. Results showed that all three independent variables related to children's adopted coping strategy.

Thirty normal, term newborns were sequentially assigned to one of three treatment groups: a control group given the routine hospital feeding of up to 30 ml of sterile water at 4 HOL and up to 30 ml of formula at 8 HOL; a water-fed group given up to 30 ml of sterile water at each feeding at 1, 2, and 3 HOL; and a third group fed formula at the same times and in the same amounts as the water-fed group. The time of initial meconium passage was significantly earlier in both groups of early fed infants than in the control group, F = 4.202, p = .026. The difference between the water-fed and the formula-fed groups was not statistically significant, but the mean time of passage was earlier in formula-fed infants. Serum indirect bilirubin levels at 48 HOL did not differ significantly, F = 0.412, p = .666, although the mean for the formula-fed group was lower. The correlation between the time of initial meconium passage and serum indirect bilirubin levels at 48 HOL was r = .3271, p = .083. Nine infants in the control group were jaundiced, compared to six in the water-fed group and six in the formula-fed group, a difference that was statistically significant, chi 2 = 6.79, p = .034.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Air flow obstruction and dyspnea were induced on Day 1 with inhalations of methacholine in doubling concentrations from 0.063 to 2.0 mg/ml. Cough was induced on Day 2 with inhalations of 3% sodium gluconate solution. Dyspnea was assessed on both days by a visual analog technique. The magnitude of dyspnea was not related to airway caliber. There was a significant negative relationship between age and magnitude of dyspnea and between cigarette pack years and dyspnea intensity. Dyspnea at baseline was positively related to dyspnea intensity during induced bronchoconstriction. Dyspnea during cough was not related to airway caliber, but there was a significant difference between males and females in the intensity of dyspnea at cough threshold. These findings may explain some of the variability observed in the experience of dyspnea in asthma.\r"

The model includes materials technology as the nature of the ambulatory care client and knowledge technology as the principal type of activities pertinent to nursing care delivery. The characteristics of these technology types were organized into causal paths to explain complexity of care. Two ambulatory care sites were sampled to obtain a client sample of 610 rating sets. Results were essentially similar to earlier research with R2s for complexity indexes at the same level of .34. Only one regression equation evidenced instability in regression coefficients and the R2. Analysis of findings indicated that other variables, such as some aspects of structure, may need to be further specified in the model in order to increase its explanatory power.\r"

A well-constructed and sited stoma accompanied by diligent, competent, and compassionate nursing management and education will insure this outcome. Information is vital in all stages of the process. Preoperative information needs to center around the nature of the surgery and the expected post-operative course. Once the information needs are met, the nurse can concentrate on the emotional support required. Preoperatively, the patient becomes dependent on health care providers to meet all of his needs. He requires patience, understanding, and repeated explanations to allay his apprehension and anxiety. Postoperatively, the patient needs information on self-care techniques and emotional support to adjust to his new method of toileting. He needs assistance to \"accept\" the new arrangement and incorporate it into his self-image and lifestyle. Long-term, the patient needs information about possible complications, the need for lifelong medical monitoring, and the availability of support services in his community. By physically preparing the patient for self-care and discharge, the nurse can gently ease him onto the road to independence and a new lease on life.\r"

The patient and family should be taught every step of protecting the skin and recognizing early signs and symptoms of potential breakdown. The loss of peristomal skin integrity affects the person's entire well-being. Pouches will not adhere as well and accidental leaks occur. The impact on psychologic well-being is difficult to measure, but can be assumed to be significant. A circular effect can begin in which the skin irritation leads to accidents, which further compromise the skin integrity. Time may be lost from work or school. Damaged skin is also painful. The cost of treating peristomal skin breakdown can be high. The products used in ostomy care are relatively expensive. A single skin barrier may range from $3 to $5. Frequent changes will be necessary to assess and treat the lesions adding to the cost. Prevention is in the realm of effective nursing care and will include assessment of the skin, selection and application of appropriate pouches and skin barriers, patient and family teaching programs, and follow-up evaluations after hospitalization.\r"

The process of pressure sore prevention requires skilled nursing assessment of the integumentary system and knowledge of risk factors, as well as an ongoing evaluation plan to monitor incidence and the efficacy of nursing care. Pressure sore assessment is greatly aided by the availability of several research-based instruments. Assessment instruments grounded in research are rather unique because few nursing problems, other than pressure sores, have such instruments available. Further testing of the predictive validity of risk factors is needed even though instruments have already proved valuable in delineating high-risk patients. Well-designed programs of process and outcome evaluation can result in lower incidence rates and reduced severity of pressure sores. Assessment and evaluation are essential to quality nursing care.\r"

Nursing functions required when there is an infection complicating the healing process or when wounds have had a surgical repair are usually determined by the physician's plan of care. Correction of malnourished states, control of diabetes, and improvement of anemia and subsequent tissue perfusion contribute to optimal states for wound healing to occur. Independent nursing functions regarding wound management include vigilance, protection from intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impede healing, and support of those factors that promote optimum environment for the healing to occur.\r"

Class II: conditions for which permanent pacemakers are frequently used but for which there is divergence of opinion with respect to the necessity of their insertion. Class III: conditions for which there is general agreement that pacemakers are unnecessary.

A large number of AIDS patients show evidence of neurologic involvement, known as AIDS-related subacute encephalopathy, which has been correlated with the presence of HIV in the brain. In this study, two genetically distinct but related viruses were isolated from one patient from two different sources in the central nervous system: brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Both viruses were found to replicate in peripheral blood lymphocytes, but only virus from brain tissue will efficiently infect macrophage/monocytes. The viruses also differ in their ability to infect a brain glioma explant culture. This infection of the brain-derived cells in vitro is generally nonproductive, and appears to be some form of persistent or latent infection. These results indicate that genetic variation of HIV in vivo may result in altered cell tropisms and possibly implicate strains of HIV with glial cell tropism in the pathogenesis of some neurologic disorders of AIDS.\r"

Ramipril lowers blood pressure in various models of hypertension and improves states of acute cardiac failure mainly by suppression of angiotensin II formation. Actions on both vasoconstrictor and volume factors are involved because ramipril causes vasodilation and mild natriuresis but preserves potassium. Sustained inhibition of converting enzyme in target tissues such as vascular wall, kidney and heart may explain cardiovascular changes over the long term. Ancillary effects may possibly emerge from modulation of the sympathetic nervous system but the contribution of bradykinin potentiation remains unclear.\r"

Washing bran with hydrochloric acid but not with water removed inhibitory factor(s). Inhibition was almost restored by reconstituting phytate level. Removal of phytates in bran by endogenous phytase significantly increased absorption of iron. Removing, by washing with water, phosphates formed from phytates during enzymatic dephytinization led to a bran fraction with only a small remaining inhibitory effect on iron absorption. Half the iron in bran is in the form of monoferric phytate, which is well-absorbed. When potassium and magnesium phytates were added in amounts present in bran, the same inhibitory effect on iron absorption was seen. Although there appear to be other factors in bran that partly explain the inhibition, phytates are the main cause of the inhibitory effect of bran on iron absorption.\r"

The increase in peroxidase activity was homogeneous in three patients (P less than 0.05). The most striking finding, however, was the occurrence of single abnormal neutrophils with peroxidase activity higher than the major neutrophil population (i.e., HPX [high peroxidase] cells). The importance of this phenomenon was correlated with the clinical status, higher HPX values being found in patients with more advanced disease. These instrumental observations were associated with the morphologic finding of atypical neutrophils, much larger than normal, with irregular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm filled with peroxidase-positive granulations. Such cells represent, in the authors' experience, the most common expression of dysgranulopoiesis in AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Serum elastase-1, amylase, lipase, and trypsin-like immunoreactivity were measured in a group of 17 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis. When assayed within 24 h of the onset of symptoms, all enzymes were found to be elevated, thus showing similar sensitivity. Elastase-1 did not improve the diagnostic score of the other enzymes studied. Owing to their much quicker and less expensive determinations, amylase and lipase should be considered the best initial markers of pancreatic injury. However, during the course of pancreatitis, amylase and in a lesser degree lipase returned to normal in more cases than elastase or trypsin; both were still elevated in 90% of the patients 10 days after the onset of the symptoms. Thus, trypsin and/or elastase-1 should be reserved for cases of doubtful or delayed diagnosis. The specificity and the positive predictive value of these enzymes need to be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin is a new 6-fluoro-7-piperazino-4-quinolone that is highly active against a broad array of microbial pathogens. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin are generally below 0.5 micrograms/ml for Hemophilus, Neisseria, and Enterobacteriaceae and are 1.0 microgram/ml or less for many non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria. Most staphylococci, including strains resistant to methicillin, are inhibited by 1.0 microgram/ml or less of ciprofloxacin, whereas streptococci are somewhat less susceptible. Obligate anaerobes are generally not susceptible to ciprofloxacin at concentrations below 1.0 microgram/ml. The antimicrobial potency of ciprofloxacin is twofold to fourfold greater than that of norfloxacin and is considerably greater than that of cephalosporins and aminoglycosides in tests with most gram-negative bacteria. Factors diminishing the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin include acidic pH, high levels of magnesium ions, and an inoculum size of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml or greater. Ciprofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations near its MIC for most bacteria. In vivo tests with experimentally induced infections in animals confirm the potency of ciprofloxacin. Doses required to protect 50 percent of animals from death are generally less than 2.0 mg/kg for gram-negative infections and range from 0.7 to 7.0 mg/kg for staphylococcal infections. The antimicrobial spectrum and potency of ciprofloxacin demonstrated in these preclinical studies make this quinolone a promising new antimicrobial agent.\r"

Prevalence of infection among homosexual/bisexual study subjects increased from an estimated 22.8 per cent during the last half of 1982 to 48.6 per cent during the period July through December 1984. During three subsequent six-month periods, prevalence remained stable at approximately 50 per cent. Annual infection rates, measured by seroconversion among seronegative study subjects, decreased from an estimated 18.4 per cent per year from 1982 to 1984, to 5.4 and 3.1 per cent during the first and second halves of 1985, and to 4.2 per cent during the first six months of 1986. These declines were associated with reductions of 60 per cent or more in the prevalence of high-risk sexual practices associated with both acquiring and disseminating infection by the human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

The granule enzyme myeloperoxidase, which can markedly amplify hydrogen peroxide-dependent antimicrobial activity, is also lost in vitro. Adherent monocytes were examined immediately, 3 and 10-14 days following explantation, for the magnitude of the stimulated respiratory burst and for cellular myeloperoxidase. Fresh cells generated 254 +/- 38 nmol O2-/mg protein as compared to a peak of 782 +/- 45 nmol O2-/mg at 3 days and less than 100 nmol O2-/mg after 10-14 days. The myeloperoxidase content of the cells also decreased; over 85% was lost after 3 days. Fresh monocytes killed over 90% of ingested Toxoplasma gondii or Leishmania major. In contrast, 10-14 day explanted monocytes killed only 12% of ingested Toxoplasma and 33% of Leishmania, and surviving organisms replicated readily. The 3-day monocytes were significantly less able to kill protozoa than were fresh cells despite their nearly 3-fold greater generation of O2-. If peroxidase was reintroduced into 3-day monocytes by coating organisms with eosinophil peroxidase prior to phagocytosis, their antiprotozoa activity was nearly restored to that of freshly explanted cells.\r"

Elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) and the total protein concentration increased acutely in lung lavage fluid, consistent with the histologic evidence of pulmonary edema, then subsided but remained above control levels for the entire exposure period. The ratio of EIC to total protein remained unchanged relative to that in control animals. Neutrophils accumulated in the lung and were recoverable by lavage with the same relative concentration profile as observed for total protein. The average elastase activity per neutrophil in cells recovered from the air space by lung lavage was 60% less than in cells recovered from peripheral blood. This was true for control or NO2-exposed rats. Thus, emphysematous changes in the NO2-exposed rat were accompanied by a marked neutrophil recruitment concomitant with an increased neutrophil elastase burden in the lung, which may have directly contributed to lesion development.\r"

Purified elastase from rabbit and human leukocytes is capable of modulating the metabolism of the cell by causing a marked decrease in both proteoglycan and protein biosynthesis. Addition of 125I-labeled elastase to chondrocytes maintained in suspension culture has shown that binding occurs, and that it is saturable and is inhibited by the addition of unlabeled enzyme. We ascertained that the active site of the enzyme was necessary for binding to the chondrocyte, since phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inactivated leukocyte elastase failed to bind. Pancreatic elastase had only a slight affinity for the receptor, whereas trypsin and bovine serum albumin failed to bind to any significant extent. Autoradiographic studies and the use of inhibitors of endocytosis, such as dansyl cadaverine, confirmed that endocytosis of elastase was the secondary event after cell binding.\r"

The exposed group showed evidence of lung fibrosis with reduced static lung volumes and lung compliance, although only three subjects had signs of interstitial fibrosis at standard chest radiography. Lung density was significantly increased in the exposed workers compared to control subjects, with greater differences between nonsmokers than between smokers. Lung density correlated inversely with static lung volumes. There was no appreciable difference in the regional distribution of lung density between exposed workers and control subjects. We conclude that lung density is often increased in workers with mild asbestosis, even in the presence of a normal chest radiograph. Measurement of lung density may be of value in the evaluation of asbestos-exposed workers for assessment of the extent of parenchymal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Lung inflammatory cells of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were evaluated for their ability to injure 51Cr-labeled AKD alveolar epithelial cells in the presence and absence of IPF alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF). The IPF cells were spontaneously releasing exaggerated amounts of superoxide (O.2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) compared with normal (P less than 0.02). Cytotoxicity of the AKD cells was markedly increased when the IPF inflammatory cells were incubated with autologous ELF (P less than 0.02). The majority of IPF patients had ELF myeloperoxidase levels above normal (P less than 0.002). Incubation of IPF ELF with AKD cells in the presence of H2O2 caused increased cellular injury (P less than 0.01 compared with control), which was suppressed by methionine, a myeloperoxidase system scavenger. IPF patients with high concentrations of ELF myeloperoxidase deteriorated more rapidly than those with low ELF myeloperoxidase (P less than 0.05). Thus, IPF is characterized by an increased spontaneous production of oxidants by lung inflammatory cells, the presence of high concentrations of myeloperoxidase in the ELF of the lower respiratory tract, and a synergistic cytotoxic effect of alveolar inflammatory cells and ELF on lung epithelial cells, suggesting oxidants may play a role in causing the epithelial cell injury of this disorder.\r"

Two hundred and twenty three sera had HIV antibodies detected by both types of assay, with confirmation of the results by further tests carried out at the Virus Reference Laboratory (VRL) in Colindale. There was a 97.3% correlation between the results obtained by the two commercial ELISA assays on the tests carried out on unheated sera. The Abbott ELISA gave significantly more false positive results than the Wellcome test when the manufacturer's instructions for cut off values were followed. There was one false negative Abbott results: it failed to react to repeated Abbott ELISA but was positive by Wellcome and confirmatory assays. Of 283 heat treated sera 14.8% gave falsely reactive results with the Abbott assay whereas there were no differences between heated and unheated sera with the Wellcome assay. VRL or Western blot confirmatory assays, or both, confirmed all the 235 positive results obtained with the Wellcome assay.\r"

  ".U": "87224044\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the immunological status of seven normal, control Mangabey monkeys and 23 Mangabey monkeys experimentally inoculated with Mangabey-origin Mycobacterium leprae. Clinically, these monkeys were divided into three broad groups: a recently inoculated group, a resistant group, and a susceptible group. The resistant group included 11 monkeys, seven of which showed no clinical sign of disease to date and four of which had shown local disease that partially regressed spontaneously. The susceptible group included eight monkeys, five of which have disseminated disease and three with local but stable disease. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these monkeys were cultured with Dharmendra-type human lepromin, one of seven normal monkeys, four of four of the recently inoculated group, seven of 10 resistant monkeys, and three of eight susceptible monkeys showed significant responses. In this experimental monkey model, we studied possible regulatory mechanisms by using OKT4- and OKT8-enriched lymphocytes, and Fc receptor-positive (FcR+) and FcR- monocyte (M phi) subsets. The OKT4+ subset was the main lepromin-responsive cell type. High percentages of OKT8+ cells showed a good negative correlation with the lymphoproliferative responses of T-enriched cells supplemented with unfractionated M phi. But the depletion of OKT8+ cells could not increase the response of nonresponding monkeys' lymphocytes. The resistant group and susceptible group did not differ in their percentages of OKT8+ cells. Because OKT8+ cells negatively regulate the response of lymphocytes and OKT4+ cells are the main responding cells, OKT8+ cells are phenotypically and functionally suppressor cells and OKT4+ cells are the helper/inducer cell population in this system. The FcR- M phi population mainly includes antigen-presenting activity, but high percentages of FcR- M phi showed a significant negative correlation with lymphoproliferative responses in the resistant group. A weak but significant lymphocyte response to Dharmendra lepromin was obtained by depleting FcR+ M phi from cultures of some susceptible monkeys, whereas lymphocytes of other susceptible monkeys remained unresponsive to lepromin. By these criteria, we could find an array of immunological defects in monkeys with experimental leprosy. The data suggest that some immunological defects may exist in the OKT4+ lymphocytes or FcR- M phi of leprosy monkeys.\r"

Through the perseverance of many individuals, stumbling blocks were overcome. The lessons learned at St. Clare's can be applied anywhere.\r"

One hundred forty-three 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups and exposed to hyperoxia (0.96 to 1.0 Fio2) or room air for 8 postnatal days. Each group was subdivided into five treatment groups, which received 6, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg/d SOD or a placebo, intramuscularly every 12 hours. All rats were then placed in room air; 52 were killed, and lung tissue and blood samples were obtained for measurement of bovine SOD concentration. The remaining rats received routine care until 58 to 60 days of age, when functional and morphologic cardiopulmonary changes were assessed. Bovine SOD concentration of pooled plasma samples increased 26-fold, from 2 to 50 micrograms/mL, between the 6 and 200 mg/kg/d SOD groups, but mean tissue concentration increased only six-fold, from 0.34 to 2.1 micrograms/lung. Cardiovascular and pulmonary changes found in each oxygen group, regardless of SOD dosage, included elevated right ventricular pressure, increased right ventricular weight, decreased number of small pulmonary arteries/mm2, decreased number of alveoli/mm2, and increased volume proportion of lung parenchyma. Thus, high plasma concentrations of bovine SOD failed to prevent the chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary sequelae of neonatal oxygen exposure in the rat, possibly because SOD did not reach the intracellular sites of action.\r"

These Group I IVS RNAs contain several conserved sequences and possess a common secondary structure. The Tetrahymena precursor ribosomal RNA possesses an IVS of this group that is known to self-splice in vitro. The nature of this IVS is of great interest to both biology and chemistry, because understanding its catalytic activity should shed new light on the function of RNA in biological systems and the evolution of RNA which might be relevant to the early stages of life on Earth. We have analysed the minimum requirement for this reaction as one approach to understanding the mechanism of this RNA catalysis. We now show that a fragment of the IVS RNA of Tetrahymena can mediate a simple transesterification reaction between the substrate GpN (where N is A, C, G or U) and the nucleophile CpU. This newly discovered reaction and its reverse reaction represent the fundamental catalytic activity of the self-splicing Group I IVSs.\r"

  ".W": "Review of published reports shows confusion regarding the pathologic sequelae of neonatal respiratory distress. To examine this problem the authors studied histologic slides of lung from 46 patients so diagnosed listed in the autopsy files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two distinct morphologic patterns emerged. In 26 patients (Group 1) there were varying sized areas of interstitial fibrosis with associated distortion of air spaces. The process was nonspecific and closely resembled the interstitial fibrosis of varying etiologies found in adults. This lesion appears to correspond to most descriptions of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A second process predominated in 10 patients (Group 3). There were normal conducting bronchi, marked uniform enlargement of distal air spaces, and little or no interstitial fibrosis. In 10 patients (Group 2) both lesions coexisted. To gain further insight into the morphology of these disorders, the authors reconstructed serial histologic sections of lung from three infants of varying sizes with normal lungs and infants of varying ages with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results confirmed the observations made on routine histologic sections by showing interstitial fibrosis in the early stages of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a reduced number of very large terminal air spaces without interstitial fibrosis in the late stages. There were no obvious differences in the clinical courses of infants with the different morphologic stages; but Group 1 patients averaged 39 days of age, Group 2 lived 142 days, and Group 3 survived 277 days. It seems probable that early bronchopulmonary dysplasia is simply the healing of alveolar wall injury of whatever cause, most commonly hyaline membrane disease of the newborn; and that in the later phases of repair, with continuing growth, there is a thinning of airway walls, but a failure of alveolar development. Recognition of these two pathologically different patterns is important for further studies of the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

Comparison of laboratory results obtained a mean of 4.9 months before and 5.4 months after the estimated date of seroconversion revealed that a significant increase in the serum IgG level (from 1149 to 1335 mg/dl on average) and in C1q binding (from 8.8% to 14.2% on average) was associated with early HIV infection (p less than 0.001). A marginally significant decrease in the ratio of helper to suppressor (CD4 to CD8) cells (from 1.55 to 1.29 on average) was also noted (p = 0.025). A marked decrease in absolute number of CD4 cells was not seen with seroconversion, which suggests that profound loss of these cells may be a long-term effect of HIV infection. The occurrence of symptoms (including fatigue, fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, joint pains, cough unrelated to smoking, shortness of breath, oral thrush, herpes zoster and rash) did not increase with seroconversion. This finding suggests that most cases of HIV seroconversion may be asymptomatic or associated with relatively minor symptoms. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy was found to develop after HIV seroconversion in about 50% of cases.\r"

The indicators used were 51Cr-labelled erythrocytes, 125I-albumin, 3H-water, and 14C-urea. Results were compared with previously obtained data in newborn lambs without hyaline membrane disease also delivered by cesarean section. Extravascular lung water was significantly higher in lambs with hyaline membrane disease [23.2 +/- 1.0 (SEM) vs. 10.7 +/- 1.4 ml/kg body wt]. Vascular permeability-surface area products for 14C-urea were significantly lower in lambs with hyaline membrane disease (0.30 +/- 0.10 vs 0.78 +/- 0.11 ml/s per kg). It is concluded that extravascular lung water is high in lambs with hyaline membrane disease. Permeability-surface area products for 14C-urea is low in lambs with hyaline membrane disease, which probably indicates a decrease in detectable surface area for exchange due to derecruitment or hypoperfusion of pulmonary exchange vessels in edematous and hypoxic areas of the lungs.\r"

Little is established, however, regarding appropriate decision-making guidelines and efficacy. The 5-year experience of the Western Massachusetts Apnea Evaluation Program was reviewed to examine patient outcome and to identify prognostic clinical features. Significant recurrent sleep apnea occurred in 7 of 110 infants in the combined awake and asleep group, and in 2 of 45 siblings of babies dying of SIDS. Unclear histories, normal laboratory tests, and uncertain diagnoses made it impossible to identify features that would indicate infants at risk for recurrence of apnea. Our data indicate that home apnea monitoring lacks specificity but is probably effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. It currently appears to be the most optimal means of managing infantile apnea.\r"

We asked whether two neutrophil secretory products, human neutrophil cationic protein (NCP) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE), would nonenzymatically alter the movement of albumin across a cultured endothelial monolayer. Both enzymes were inactivated by heating before use. HNE was additionally enzymatically inactivated with a chloromethylketone oligopeptide (CMK) inhibitor and with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). Heated NCP, heated HNE, and CMK-complexed HNE all increased transendothelial albumin transfer. The cation protamine also increased albumin transfer across the endothelium and this increase was blocked by heparin. Alpha 1-PI and fetal bovine serum also prevented the cationic proteins from increasing albumin transfer. Using the release of lactate dehydrogenase as a marker of cytotoxicity, heated HNE was toxic to endothelial cells, heated NCP had only minimal toxicity, and protamine had no toxicity. Changes in endothelial cell shape with gap formation was seen after exposure to both heated HNE and heated NCP. Both the cytotoxicity associated with heated HNE and the cell shape changes associated with heated NCP and heated HNE could be blocked by heparin. These results suggest that in addition to neutrophil proteases and reactive O2 molecules, neutrophil-derived cationic proteins can directly and nonenzymatically contribute to edema formation during acute inflammation.\r"

We found that the inhibitor is antigenically related to the Bb fragment of complement factor B. Lupus plasma and purified inhibitor significantly reduced the chemotactic activity of zymosan-treated normal serum, an effect that was abolished by antibodies to factor B. Similar results were obtained when purified Bb was used. Neither purified inhibitor nor Bb inhibited the chemotactic activity of purified human C5a or C5a des Arg. As reported previously, the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg was enhanced significantly by the addition of an anionic polypeptide (cochemotaxin) present in normal serum and plasma. Interestingly, both purified lupus inhibitor and Bb inhibited the chemotactic activity exhibited by mixtures of C5a des Arg and its cochemotaxin. This effect was due, most likely, to their ability to neutralize the enhancing effect of the cochemotaxin on the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg. Immunoelectrophoresis and western blots revealed that the purified inhibitor reacted with anti-factor B and exhibited a similar charge and molecular weight as purified Bb.\r"

Total RNA was purified from IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma activated macrophages, and Northern blot analysis was performed by using subcloned fragments specific for precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) as probes. All types of interferon (alpha, beta, gamma) at the doses normalized for induction of cytotoxic activity caused accumulation of 45S, 41S, and 36S pre-rRNA. In contrast, the levels of 32S pre-RNA and 28S, 5.8S, and 18S mature rRNA were not affected by IFN treatment. Therefore, the accumulation of pre-rRNA in macrophages activated to cytotoxicity by IFN was not paralleled by changes in total content of mature rRNA. No accumulation of pre-rRNA upon IFN treatment was found in a murine fibroblast cell line (L929 cells) or in a macrophage cell line (GG2EE) immortalized from bone marrow of C3H/HeJ mice. Neither of those cell lines become cytotoxic in response to IFN. Overall, our data support the concept that IFN acts selectively on the mechanism controlling the levels of some pre-rRNA and that the mechanism of IFN action involves the post-transcriptional control of ribosomal gene expression.\r"

Viral particles in the cultures and the brain were of various sizes and shapes; particles ranged from 70 to over 160 nm in diameter, with a variable position of dense nucleoids and less dense core shells. In the brain, viral particles were located free in the cytoplasm of both multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear macrophage-like cells. There was intracellular budding of HIV particles from unidentified membranes, yielding intracellular immature or recently budded particles, with crescentic densities. By contrast, HIV particles in the infected H9 lymphocytes were not free in the cytoplasm but were instead located either extracellularly or in intracellular vacuoles. A small percentage of cells in the cultures were surrounded by immature particles only. Production (replication) of HIV occurred within infected macrophage-like cells in the brain of the child.\r"

Selenium content of cow milk was found to be lower than that of either human or goat milk. Regardless of source, less than 3% of total milk selenium was associated with the lipid fraction. Selenium within the 120,000 X g supernatant accounted for 72, 62 and 30% of the total in cow, human and goat milk, respectively. Glutathione peroxidase occurred in all milk samples with goat greater than human greater than cow. Percent of total peroxidase activity associated with glutathione peroxidase was 29, 27 and 65 for human, cow and goat milk, respectively. Approximately 20-28% of the selenium in milk was removed by dialysis (molecular exclusion of 6-8 kDa). After gel chromatography, 8-12 selenoprotein fractions were detected in undialyzed skim milk from each species. Most of the glutathione peroxidase activity was found in the fractions corresponding to 170 and 96 kDa in milk from all species examined. The diameric form of glutathione peroxidase also appeared in dialyzed and undialyzed milk. Distinct differences in the content and distribution of selenoproteins among these species in fresh and dialyzed milk are discussed.\r"

Procedure A, no supplemental oxygenation, was compared to Procedure B, in which controlled supplemental oxygenation was used. For controlled supplemental oxygenation, the FiO2 was increased until TcPO2 measurements rose to levels between 90 and 100 torr. Sixteen premature infants who required mechanical ventilation were studied in the neonatal center. Both procedures were performed on each patient in random order. In both procedures, a precipitous decrease in TcPO2 was observed during chest vibration, and further decrease in TcPO2 was noted with endotracheal suctioning. Except for baseline readings, throughout the tracheobronchial hygiene TcPO2 measurements were significantly higher and more subjects maintained TcPO2 values greater than 40 torr in Procedure B. In Procedure A corresponding TcPO2 measurements were 40 torr or less. Mean recovery time was shorter in Procedure B, 2.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, than in Procedure A, 4.9 +/- 2.8 minutes, p less than .003. Thus, in most patients, controlled supplemental oxygenation without manual bag ventilation seems sufficient to prevent hypoxia during tracheobronchial hygiene; it also shortens recovery time from hypoxemia as a result of the bronchopulmonary hygiene procedure.\r"

Time 1 interviews were conducted approximately 3 days after surgery; Time 2 interviews were conducted 30 days later. Psychosocial adjustment was measured as a multidimensional construct using the Affects Balance Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale. Repeated measures analysis indicated that husbands' scores did not differ significantly from patients' scores on the adjustment measures that assessed level of mood and amount of symptom distress. Both patients and husbands reported levels of distress significantly above the level reported for the normal population. Patients and husbands differed only on the adjustment measure that assessed problems in carrying out various psychosocial roles, with patients reporting more role adjustment problems than husbands. Although both patients and husbands reported dramatic improvement in their levels of mood from Time 1 to Time 2, no significant change occurred in their levels of distress. Medical and demographic factors had little relationship to subjects' levels of adjustments at either time.\r"

Findings implied that for some patients seclusion may have been unnecessary, but for others it was beneficial. Subjects who reported out-of-control impulses or pathological intensity of relationships prior to seclusion and who showed positive change in mood, behavior, or thinking toward staff and/or other patients during or after seclusion seem to have benefited from the experience.\r"

Both parents reported a significant decline in marital satisfaction from 3 months prebirth to 3 months postbirth. Mothers' evaluations of their postbirth marital relationships were positively influenced by more nontraditional sex role attitudes and greater father involvement in infant care, and negatively influenced by marital inequity and a more temperamentally active infant. Fathers' postbirth marital satisfaction was more negatively influenced by marital inequity than mothers'. Other factors did not contribute to fathers' marital assessment. Results suggest that a mother's perception of marital satisfaction after parenthood is more complex than a father's, and that equity is a greater consideration for men than for women during the transition to parenthood.\r"

Based on important components of synchronous interaction reported in the literature, the instrument consists of six items, a total score, and a summary rating. Videotapes of 38 term and preterm mother-infant pairs were studied to establish reliability and validity of the tool. Interrater reliability was determined using Cohen's kappa and percent of agreement; kappa was .86 for the total score and ranged from .63 to .92 for each of the six items. A discrimination index, applied to each item, indicated that four items are good predictors of the final rating and two require further testing. Dyadic Mini Code summary ratings compared to mean coherence values computed from Monadic Phase Scale (Tronick, Als, & Brazelton, 1980) scores on the same data yielded moderate concurrent validity; point bi-serial analysis, rpb = .488, p less than .01; and chi 2 = 4.878, df = 1, Fisher's exact test (1-tail) = p less than .05. Construct validity was demonstrated by finding that the instrument discriminated between preterm and term dyads according to expected differences, chi 2 = 4.071, df = 1, Fisher's exact test (1-tail) = p less than .05. Further refinement of the DMC is indicated.\r"

However, 65% of proposals funded by private organizations and 59% of intramurally supported projects were for $3,000 or less. A variety of strategies led to private sector support of successful nursing research proposals. These included making direct, personal contact with funding agencies, matching proposals with the needs and interests of the funding agency, networking with other professionals to obtain funding information, and submitting well-written proposals consistent with agency guidelines.\r"

In this retrospective study of 25 granulocytopenic patients recently treated with tobramycin and ticarcillin, a combined favorable or partial response rate of 78% was achieved, without loss of efficacy over time as a result of emerging resistance of organisms. Our reevaluation of this antibiotic regimen emphasizes that it continues to be as efficacious and safe as newer antibiotic combinations, and supports its continued use until a newer regimen is shown to have significant advantages. This study also emphasizes the significance of staphylococci as pathogens in granulocytopenia, and suggests the need to add specific antistaphylococcal coverage whenever catheter-related infection is suspected.\r"

The purpose of the present investigation was to utilize a newly developed competitive kinin receptor antagonist to test the hypothesis that kallikrein-induced dilation was due to the conversion of brain kininogen to vasoactive kinins. As in our previous study, we measured rabbit pial arteriole diameter with a microscope using the closed cranial window technique. The kinin antagonist (6 microM) reduced the dose-dependent dilation produced by bradykinin and blocked the dilation induced by kallikrein. In addition, the kinin antagonist was specific since it did not alter the cerebral arteriole dilation produced by adenosine, acetylcholine, or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. These experiments provide further evidence for a possible role of the endogenous brain kallikrein-kinin system in the modulation of the cerebral circulation and provide the necessary pharmacologic foundation for future use of this antagonist in testing the role of kinins in the normal or altered cerebral circulation.\r"

This method was much more sensitive and faster than other technics with which it was compared. Fragment Ba was detected in 22 of 28 rheumatoid arthritis plasma samples and in 12 of 15 systemic lupus erythematous samples but in only 8 of 68 samples obtained from healthy volunteers. The traditional approach of measuring total Factor B for the assessment of activation of the alternative pathway showed values that were even higher than normal in these diseases. The measurement of plasma Ba promises to be a valuable means of assessment of the activation of Factor B and the alternative pathway of complement in clinical disorders.\r"

  ".W": "How does pulmonary emphysema affect aerosol deposition? Groups of awake hamsters with emphysema (intratracheal elastase, 0.2 mg/100 g body wt) and age-matched controls (intratracheal saline) were exposed for 30 minutes to an insoluble radioactive aerosol (0.45 mu aerodynamic diameter) at 30, 60, or 90 days after instillation. Immediately after exposure, the animals were sacrificed. The lungs were excised, dried at total lung capacity, and sliced into 1-mm thick sections. Each slice was cut into pieces, which were counted for radioactivity and weighed. Then a measure of the uniformity of deposition, the evenness index (EI), was calculated. With perfect uniformity, all EIs would be one. We found fewer particles in the emphysematous, as compared with the control, lungs at 60 or 90 days after elastase instillation. The deposited particles were distributed less uniformly throughout the emphysematous lungs than in the control lungs. In controls, the standard deviation (SD) of the EI distribution (mean 1.0) averaged 0.33 for the three times studied. In elastase animals, the SD increased to 0.48 at 30 days, and at 60 days and 90 days the distributions were no longer normally distributed. This increased heterogeneity of deposition was also manifested as a loss of the normal apex-base gradient observed in control animals, an increase in the amount of nonventilated parenchyma, enhanced airway deposition, and an altered lobar deposition pattern. Morphometric analysis showed an increase in the mean linear intercept (MLI) of emphysematous lungs as compared with control lungs. However, the author found no correlation between MLI, a measure of emphysema, and EI, a measure of deposition, quantified in the same lung pieces. It is concluded that the emphysematous lesions produced by elastase markedly alter the deposition of an inhaled submicrometric aerosol. Factors that may contribute to these changes include airway obstruction and differences in breathing pattern in emphysematous as compared with control animals.\r"

Endocarditis was treated with ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg [body weight] intravenously every 8 h) or vancomycin (17.5 mg/kg intravenously every 6 h) for 3 days. Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were equally efficacious in clearing bacteremia. Both reduced vegetation bacterial counts by 5 log10 CFU/g and renal and splenic bacterial counts by more than 3 log10 CFU/g as compared with untreated control rabbits after 26 h of infection (P less than 0.001). Both antimicrobial agents were able to eradicate the infectious process in an equivalent proportion of animals. No methicillin-resistant S. aureus that was recovered from ciprofloxacin-treated rabbits developed resistance to ciprofloxacin during therapy. Peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin in the sera of rabbits with endocarditis were significantly higher than those predicted by single-dose studies in uninfected rabbits. This finding was likely due to changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drug with multiple dosing and in infected versus uninfected rabbits. This study demonstrated that intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is as efficacious as vancomycin is in an in vivo model of a serious systemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.\r"

Dissociation of the antimycobacterial and prooxidative effects of clofazimine was possible by manipulation of the chemical group in position 2 of the phenazine molecule. When nitrogen-containing substituents in this position were replaced by oxygen, the mode of the prooxidative action of the compounds was altered.\r"

Experiments were performed in vitro on isolated bundles of muscle stimulated electrically. In control animals peak twitch tension was similar in the two muscles. In contrast, the twitch contraction time and one-half relaxation time of the transverse abdominis were significantly greater than that of the external oblique. The isometric tension generated over a range of stimulus frequencies (i.e., the force-frequency relationship) was a greater percent of the maximum value in response to subtetanizing frequencies (10-40 Hz) in the transverse abdominis than in the external oblique. For both abdominal muscles, however, the tension generated over this range of stimulus frequencies was less than that of the diaphragm. The endurance of the transverse abdominis during repeated contractions was significantly greater than that of the external oblique but similar to the diaphragm. The effect of chronic hyperinflation produced by elastase-induced emphysema on the contractile function of the two muscles was assessed in a second group of adult hamsters. In emphysematous animals peak twitch tension, contraction time, and one-half relaxation time of the twitch and force-frequency curves of muscles from emphysematous animals were similar to values obtained in control animals for both the external oblique and transverse abdominis. However, the endurance of both the transverse abdominis and external oblique muscles was greater in emphysematous than control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
