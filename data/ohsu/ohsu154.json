Sham treatment produced no such favourable changes. It is concluded that haemodilution therapy can be clinically effective in patients with arterial obstructions in the legs. It seems particularly promising when the vascular obstructions are such that low average shear stresses act on the blood in multiple, long collaterals.\r"

Clinical improvement was evident within 2 days of the start of steroid therapy, and in none of the 10 patients did clinical deterioration or recurrence of PCP occur on cessation of steroid therapy. In 1 steroid-treated patient disseminated herpes zoster developed 2 days after discontinuation of methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone seems to be a useful adjunctive therapeutic agent for patients with AIDS in whom Pneumocystis carinii is the sole respiratory pathogen.\r"

Samples from 47 (94%) of 50 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome and 1 (7%) of 14 patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome reacted with the recombinant La. No reactivity was demonstrated in 196 patients with other ANA-associated autoimmune diseases or in 100 healthy subjects. The study confirms the high correlation between ANA, anti-La, and primary Sjogren's syndrome and shows how gene cloning can provide large quantities of human autoantigens for use in highly specific and sensitive diagnostic assays.\r"

In contrast, success rates in general medical practices are similar with nicotine gum (11.4%) and with placebo gum (11.7%) at 6 months (n = 1022). However, in general practices, the success rates are 17% for nicotine gum and 13% for the no gum control at 4-6 months, and 9% and 5% at 12 months, a significant difference between the treatments at each time (n = 2238). The data suggest that proper use of nicotine gum in specialised clinics will increase the rate of stopping patients smoking. The use of the gum in general medical practices is questionable.\r"

All of the controls remained positive for HBeAg and HBsAg. Seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe was preceded in all cases by a pronounced increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels of more than ten times the upper limit of normal at eight to twelve weeks; this response was exclusively associated with interferon therapy. These results suggest that loss of HBsAg and a hepatitis-like illness in the third month of therapy are direct effects of interferon treatment.\r"

T-cell sensitisation to HBcAg followed, with IgM anti-HBc appearing 10 days later. A cellular immune response to HBsAg was the last to appear, 10 days before the onset of liver damage.

The 95% CI for the difference between the placebo and prednisolone groups in the proportion of patients having pain at 6 months was minus 17% to plus 20%. Prednisolone, however, relieved pain for the first 3 days. The 1-2 week interval between admission and reappearance of pain and development of triggered pain seems to be the time needed to establish neuralgia. Once established, the type and intensity of pain remained largely unaltered.\r"

  ".W": "In 11 pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios due to spontaneous rupture of the membranes in the second trimester of pregnancy fetal breathing movements were assessed regularly by ultrasonographic examinations. In the 6 cases in which fetal breathing movements were detected the babies were liveborn and there was no evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia or the other non-renal features of Potter's syndrome. In the other 5 cases there were no fetal breathing movements. 1 pregnancy was terminated electively, and 1 ended in an intrauterine death; the remaining 3 infants died in the neonatal period. All 5 cases showed necropsy evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia. These findings indicate that premature and prolonged rupture of membranes in the second trimester of pregnancy does not uniformly result in a poor prognosis. They suggest that fetal breathing movements could be used as a predictor of favourable neonatal outcome.\r"

The other 41 patients received parallel treatment in which the main differences were less extensive initial local anaesthesia and manipulation, and substitution of saline for proliferant. Neither patients nor assessors knew which treatment had been given. When assessed by disability scores the experimental group had greater improvement than the control group at one (p less than 0.001), three (p less than 0.004), and six (p less than 0.001) months from the end of treatment; at six months an improvement of more than 50% was recorded in 35 of the experimental group versus 16 of the control group and the numbers free from disability were 15 and 4, respectively (p less than 0.003). Visual analogue pain scores and pain diagrams likewise showed significant advantages for the experimental regimen.\r"

All patients received cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation before transplantation and cyclosporin after BMT. Marrow treatment removed 97% of T cells (median) in group B and 99% in group C. Although both serious and mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were reduced in T-cell depleted patients, graft failure and relapse were increased. Graft failure was caused by GVHD and transplant complications in the controls and by rejection and relapse in the T-cell depleted groups; relapse-free survival did not differ between the groups. Without better control of host immunity and of the residual leukaemia T-cell depletion of the marrow, BMT should not be pursued in standard-risk patients.\r"

Recent studies indicate that in patients with head and neck cancer, a decrease in LIF (leukocyte migration inhibiting factor) production is usually present in advanced disease. In this study, the authors investigate: the LIF production in lymphocytes derived from the peripheral blood and cervical nodes of patients with laryngeal carcinoma by using an autologous pattern (i.e., for each patient, the specific LIF production was challenged by means of an autologous cell extract derived from his own tumor); the influence of histologically confirmed cervical node metastases on LIF production. Our results indicate that: There is a significant decrease in LIF production in patients with histologically proven cervical node metastases as compared to patients with no metastatic foci. The decrease of LIF production is related to the presence of mononuclear adherent cells. When the latter are removed, there is a significant reversal of specific LIF suppression. The possible meaning of the data is discussed.\r"

The mean age of the runners was 43.8 yr (range = 18 to 70), the mean years' running was 6.8 yr (range = 0.5 to 29), and the mean best standard 42.2 km marathon time was 3 h 28 min (range = 2 h 33 min to 4 h 28 min). Coronary artery disease was diagnosed either clinically, angiographically, or at autopsy in 27 runners (75%), two of whom also had histological evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Seventy-one percent of the runners with coronary artery disease had premonitory symptoms, and most ignored such symptoms and continued to train or race. Fifty percent of all cardiac events occurred either during or within 24 h of competitive running events or long training runs. The marathon running population does not constitute solely persons with excellent cardiovascular health. Marathon runners, especially those with a family history of heart disease and other coronary risk factors, should not consider themselves immune to either sudden death or to coronary heart disease and should seek medical advice immediately if they develop any symptoms suggestive of ischemic heart disease. Physicians should not assume that \"physically fit\" marathon runners cannot have serious, life-threatening cardiac disease.\r"

  ".W": "Nine healthy subjects were studied to determine their performance and the metabolic and hormonal responses to prolonged exercise after ingestion of a carbohydrate or a lipid diet. Subjects exercised on a bicycle ergometer (60% VO2max) until exhaustion four times at weekly intervals. The exercise test was performed 1 h after ingestion of three different isocaloric meals (400 Kcal) containing either glucose, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). The fourth test was performed after a night fast. The metabolism of these nutriments was followed using [U-13C]glucose, [1-13C]octanoate, and [1-13C]palmitate added as tracers. The average work time was comparable whatever nutriment used (116 +/- 11 min). Oxidation of the ingested nutriment over this period was 80% for glucose, 45% for MCTs, and 9% for LCTs. Glucose ingestion produced an early insulin peak associated at the end of the exercise with a lower glycemia compared to the fat diets. After MCT ingestion, an increase in ketone bodies was observed. Catecholamine response to physical exercise was decreased by all the meals when compared to fasting. Thus, we conclude that a different lipid meal, MCTs, or LCTs, compared to glucose feeding, do not modify exhaustion time in spite of differences in hormonal and metabolic responses.\r"

In only one-third of cases was the angiogram diagnostic, and in a single case it altered the pre-angiogram diagnosis by revealing a previously unsuspected embolus. Among the cases clinically diagnosed as cerebral emboli, the 2 confirmatory angiograms were performed early (within 48 hours), and demonstrated medium-large or large vessel filling defects. Two-thirds of the negative angiograms in the embolic clinical category were delayed, but there was no statistically relevant predilection for specific vessel size involvement. The category, primary cerebral vasculopathy, comprised the largest group, 10 in all, and one-half had angiographic confirmation despite time delays. Angiographic recognition was dependent on a characteristic picture of vascular involvement, and not on timing or vessel size predilection. Mitral valve prolapse figured prominently in the clinical cases of vasculopathy of uncertain etiology, which contained a total of 4 cases. The 3 cases with nondiagnostic angiograms were all delayed and demonstrated nonspecific radiographic changes. Clinically, these cases demonstrated signs or symptoms of autoimmune dysfunction, raising the specter of primary cerebral vasculopathy as a cause of cerebral infarction, in contrast to recurrent cerebral emboli.\r"

In the present study, serum lipids were examined in 201 clinically stable renal transplant recipients before, 1 year after, and at the time of the last follow-up, 5.0 +/- 0.1 yr after transplantation. Hypertriglyceridemia, present in 36% of patients treated with dialysis before transplantation, occurred in 23% 1 year after successful transplantation. At last follow-up, 29% had elevated triglyceride levels. Hypercholesterolemia, present in only 8% of patients before transplantation, was found in 27% 1 year after receiving a renal allograft. At the time of last follow-up, 30% had elevated cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels were normal 1 year after transplantation, and increased significantly during the posttransplant follow-up period. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was used to determine factors independently associated with serum lipid levels. Age, body weight, pretransplant serum lipids, and variables linked to allograft function (urine protein excretion, serum creatinine, and the use of loop diuretics) were independently associated with posttransplant cholesterol and triglycerides. Diabetes, the use of alternate day steroids, beta-adrenergic-blocking antihypertensive medications, and thiazide diuretics were not linked to hyperlipidemia. In addition, changes in variables associated with renal function helped to explain why different factors were associated with lipid levels at 1 year than at the time of last follow-up. Thus, the results of this study suggest that hyperlipidemia is a frequent and persistent complication in clinically stable renal transplant recipients. Multiple factors, including several associated with declining allograft function, appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of posttransplant hyperlipidemia.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) is structurally similar to insulin and shares many of its biologic properties. We compared the short-term metabolic effects of recombinant IGF I (100 micrograms [13.3 nmol] per kilogram of body weight) and insulin (0.15 IU [1 nmol] per kilogram) in eight healthy volunteers (four men and four women). The hypoglycemic responses to both hormones were nearly identical in the doses used. The lowest blood glucose levels were reached after 30 minutes: 1.98 +/- 0.44 mmol per liter after IGF I and 1.78 +/- 0.29 after insulin. On a molar basis, IGF I was only 6 percent as potent as insulin in the production of hypoglycemia. Insulin also inhibited lipolysis more effectively than IGF I. Levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, glucagon, and cortisol responded similarly to both agents. The hypoglycemia produced by IGF I is probably due to the supraphysiologic concentrations of the free peptide that result from its rapid intravenous injection. Fifteen minutes after injection, the serum level of IGF I increased from 144 +/- 38 ng per milliliter at base line to 424 +/- 56, of which 80 percent was free in the plasma (not bound to IGF carrier proteins). The determination of whether any of the short-term metabolic effects of IGF I have any clinical application will require further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of oral azidothymidine (AZT) in 282 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) manifested by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia alone, or with advanced AIDS-related complex. The subjects were stratified according to numbers of T cells with CD4 surface markers and were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of AZT or placebo by mouth every four hours for a total of 24 weeks. One hundred forty-five subjects received AZT, and 137 received placebo. When the study was terminated, 27 subjects had completed 24 weeks of the study, 152 had completed 16 weeks, and the remainder had completed at least 8 weeks. Nineteen placebo recipients and 1 AZT recipient died during the study (P less than 0.001). Opportunistic infections developed in 45 subjects receiving placebo, as compared with 24 receiving AZT. The base-line Karnofsky performance score and weight increased significantly among AZT recipients (P less than 0.001). A statistically significant increase in the number of CD4 cells was noted in subjects receiving AZT (P less than 0.001). After 12 weeks, the number of CD4 cells declined to pretreatment values among AZT recipients with AIDS but not amonG AZT recipients with AIDS-related complex. Skin-test anergy was partially reversed in 29 percent of subjects receiving AZT, as compared with 9 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that AZT administration can decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in a selected group of subjects with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, at least over the 8 to 24 weeks of observation in this study.\r"

Although significant clinical benefit was documented (N Engl J Med 1987; 317:185-91), serious adverse reactions, particularly bone marrow suppression, were observed. Nausea, myalgia, insomnia, and severe headaches were reported more frequently by recipients of AZT; macrocytosis developed within weeks in most of the AZT group. Anemia with hemoglobin levels below 7.5 g per deciliter developed in 24 percent of AZT recipients and 4 percent of placebo recipients (P less than 0.001). Twenty-one percent of AZT recipients and 4 percent of placebo recipients required multiple red-cell transfusions (P less than 0.001). Neutropenia (less than 500 cells per cubic millimeter) occurred in 16 percent of AZT recipients, as compared with 2 percent of placebo recipients (P less than 0.001). Subjects who entered the study with low CD4 lymphocyte counts, low serum vitamin B12 levels, anemia, or low neutrophil counts were more likely to have hematologic toxic effects. Concurrent use of acetaminophen was also associated with a higher frequency of hematologic toxicity. Although a subset of patients tolerated AZT for an extended period with few toxic effects, the drug should be administered with caution because of its toxicity and the limited experience with it to date.\r"

Among 91 patients who met preestablished criteria for randomization, cure or improvement was noted in 75 percent of those treated for four weeks and in 85 percent of those treated for six weeks. The estimated relapse rate for the four-week regimen was higher--27 as compared with 16 percent--whereas the incidence of toxic effects for the two regimens was similar--44 as compared with 43 percent. Among 23 transplant recipients, 4 of 5 treated for four weeks relapsed, leading to the decision to treat the rest of the group for six weeks. Only 3 of the 18 treated for six weeks relapsed. In a third group of 80 patients, the protocol was not followed during the initial four weeks, and these patients were not randomized. Thirty-eight died or relapsed. Multifactorial analysis of pretreatment factors for all 194 patients identified three significant predictors (P less than 0.05) of a favorable response: headache as a symptom, normal mental status, and a cerebrospinal fluid white-cell count above 20 per cubic millimeter. These and other findings in this study are consistent with the view that the four-week regimen should be reserved for patients who have meningitis without neurologic complications, underlying disease, or immunosuppressive therapy; a pretreatment cerebrospinal fluid white-cell count above 20 per cubic millimeter and a serum cryptococcal antigen titer below 1:32; and at four weeks of therapy, a negative cerebrospinal fluid India ink preparation and serum and cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal-antigen titers below 1:8. Patients who do not meet these criteria should receive at least six weeks of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Although the risk of Down's syndrome increases with maternal age, women under 35 bear about 80 percent of the infants born with this condition. We prospectively investigated the utility of measuring maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester in women under 35 in order to identify pregnancies in which the fetus was affected with Down's syndrome. Over a two-year period, 34,354 women in this age group were screened. Amniocentesis was offered when the risk of Down's syndrome, calculated as a function of maternal age and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration adjusted for maternal weight and race, was 1:270 or higher, the risk for a 35-year-old woman. This threshold was exceeded in 1451 women in whom gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound; 9 women in this group had a fetus with the syndrome. In three women whose fetuses had trisomy 18 and one whose fetus had trisomy 13, the calculated risk of Down's syndrome was 1:270 or higher. Thus, among women in whom the risk exceeded our cutoff point, 1 in 161 were found to have a pregnancy in which the fetus was affected with Down's syndrome; the figure was 1 in 112 for all autosomal trisomies. Eighteen pregnancies involving Down's syndrome, three involving trisomy 18, and two involving trisomy 13 were not associated with a calculated risk above the cutoff point. The available data indicate that in our population, using a cutoff for risk at which 5 percent of women under 35 are offered amniocentesis, we will detect one quarter to one third of pregnancies in which the fetus has Down's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "High blood pressure is prevalent in obesity and in diabetes, both conditions with insulin resistance. To test whether hypertension is associated with insulin resistance independently of obesity and glucose intolerance, we measured insulin sensitivity (using the euglycemic insulin-clamp technique), glucose turnover (using [3H]glucose isotope dilution), and whole-body glucose oxidation (using indirect calorimetry) in 13 young subjects (38 +/- 2 years [+/- SEM]) with untreated essential hypertension (165 +/- 6/112 +/- 3 mm Hg), normal body weight, and normal glucose tolerance. In the postabsorptive state, all measures of glucose metabolism were normal. During steady-state euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (about 60 microU per milliliter), hepatic glucose production and lipolysis were effectively suppressed, and glucose oxidation and potassium disposal were normally stimulated. However, total insulin-induced glucose uptake was markedly impaired (3.80 +/- 0.32 vs. 6.31 +/- 0.42 mg per minute per kilogram of body weight in 11 age- and weight-matched controls, P less than 0.001). Thus, reduced nonoxidative glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis and glycolysis) accounted for virtually all the defect in overall glucose uptake (1.19 +/- 0.24 vs. 3.34 +/- 0.44 mg per minute per kilogram, P less than 0.001). Total glucose uptake was inversely related to systolic or mean blood pressure (r = 0.76 for both, P less than 0.001). These results provide preliminary evidence that essential hypertension is an insulin-resistant state. We conclude that this insulin resistance involves glucose but not lipid or potassium metabolism, is located in peripheral tissues but not the liver, is limited to nonoxidative pathways of intracellular glucose disposal, and is directly correlated with the severity of hypertension.\r"

If we are to conquer this disease we will need a protective vaccine or effective drugs able to block the life cycle of the virus. An early stage in the invasion of the host cell is the conversion of the RNA genome of the virus to a double-stranded DNA intermediate which subsequently becomes integrated into the host cell chromosome. The enzyme reverse transcriptase is crucial in this process and is thus an obvious chemotherapeutic target. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis of this enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli to reveal several important functional regions of the protein including putative components of the triphosphate binding site and pyrophosphate exchange sites.\r"

The 2-deoxy analogue of beta-KDO (3-deoxy-beta-D-manno-2-octulopyranosonic acid) is a potent inhibitor of a key enzyme (CMP-KDO synthetase) in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis of Gram-negative bacteria, but it fails to penetrate intact bacteria. Coupling an L-L-dipeptide to the 8-amino-2,8-dideoxy analogue of beta-KDO enabled it to be recognized and actively accumulated by certain peptide permeases of the cytoplasmic membrane. The dipeptide was hydrolysed in the cell and the inhibitor released. Subsequent inhibition of CMP-KDO synthetase led to the accumulation of large amounts of lipid A precursor and bacterial death. These compounds represent a new class of synthetic antimicrobials with a novel mechanism of action and considerable potential as chemotherapeutic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli that cause infections of the human urinary tract produce so-called Pap-pili, which are hair-like appendages consisting of about 10(3) helically arranged subunits of the protein PapA. These pili mediate binding to digalactoside-containing glycolipids present on the epithelial cells which line the urinary tract. Recently, it has been suggested that three proteins, PapE, PapF and PapG, are responsible for this binding. In the absence of PapA, non-piliated bacteria are formed which nonetheless exhibit binding, showing that the bulk of the pilus is not essential for binding. Although pili can form without PapF and PapG, such pili are unable to bind to the digalactoside. The protein PapG mediates binding specificity in trans-complementation experiments, so this protein is the digalactoside-specific adhesin. Using immuno-electron microscopy we have found that Pap-pili are heteropolymers composed of the major pilin, PapA, the minor pilins, PapE and PapF, and the adhesin, PapG. The last three proteins are located at the tip of the pilus.\r"

  ".W": "Identification of the source of energy for protein translocation across biological membranes is important in understanding the mechanism of this process. In eukaryotic cells, the tight coupling between translation and translocation and firm attachment of the secreting ribosomes to membranes, as well as theoretical calculations, have led to the suggestion that energy derived from protein synthesis is sufficient for protein translocation. On the other hand, in bacterial systems neither the attachment of ribosomes to membrane (other than nascent chains) nor tight coupling of translocation to translocation has been observed. Moreover, certain proteins can be translocated across membranes either at the time of, or after, translation. The separation of protein translocation from translation has made possible the demonstration that ATP hydrolysis is essential for post-translational protein translocation across bacterial membranes and, more recently, also across canine and yeast endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Here we report that certain ATP analogues inhibit co-translational protein translocation at concentrations that do not interfere with protein synthesis, suggesting that ATP is also required for co-translational protein translocation.\r"

  ".W": "A 12 amino-acid synthetic peptide (NANP)3 comprising the immunodominant epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide, and administered intramuscularly in three doses at monthly intervals to 35 healthy males as a malaria vaccine. No significant adverse reactions were noted, with mild soreness at the injection site the only common symptom. Seroconversions against NANP occurred in 53% and 71% of recipients of 100 or 160 micrograms, respectively, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Most ELISA-positive sera reacted with sporozoites by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Three vaccinees with the highest ELISA and IFA titres and four unimmunized controls were challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites introduced via the bites of infective Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood stage parasites were detected in all controls by 10 days (mean 8.5 days, range 7-10). In contrast, the two vaccinees who became infected did not manifest parasitaemia until day 11 and the third vacinee showed neither parasites nor symptoms during the 29 day observation period. This first synthetic peptide parenteral vaccine against a communicable disease tested in man is safe and stimulates biologically active antibodies. These observations encourage the development of improved vaccine formulations which, by enhancing immunogenicity, may lead to practical vaccines to assist in the control of falciparum malaria.\r"

It has been proposed that an essential component of this structure is a zinc ion bound between two pairs of cysteine residues. The GAL4-encoded protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which binds to DNA and activates the transcription of several genes, contains this sequence motif. Here I describe a gal4 mutant with an alteration in the cysteine-zinc DNA binding finger whose defect is corrected in vivo by high concentrations of ZnCl2. The DNA binding activity of the altered protein from this mutant is restored by ZnCl2 in vitro. This is evidence that the GAL4 protein indeed contains zinc ions essential for its DNA binding activity.\r"

  ".U": "87258277\r", 
  ".W": "U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217, including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, suggesting the presence of a distant control element. DNase I footprinting of the 5' flanking region of the U6 gene shows protection of the octanucleotide sequence. Moreover, the 5' flanking sequence from -217 to -315 can replace the enhancer of a human U2 RNA gene. We therefore conclude that although U6 RNA genes appear to be transcribed by pol III, they are preceeded by an enhancer-like element which can functionally substitute for the enhancer of a pol II-transcribed U RNA gene.\r"

  ".W": "Two different models have been proposed to explain the relative frequencies of the non-mendelian allelic segregations which are detected by tetrad analysis after meiosis in fungi. The first model maintains that 6:2 type tetrads result from correction of heteroduplexes containing mismatched sites and 5:3 type tetrads result from failure to correct mismatched sites. The second model suggests that 6:2 segregations result from the filling-in of double-strand gaps using information obtained from both strands of a homologous duplex. In this model 5:3 type tetrads result if the allele is included in the heteroduplex regions flanking the gap and the resulting mismatched nucleotides are not corrected. We have studied the correction of heteroduplex plasmid DNA in pms1 mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are known to exhibit higher frequencies of 5:3 type tetrads and lower frequencies of 6:2 tetrads than wild-type strains. Our results suggest that the pms1 mutation causes a defect in mismatch correction, supporting the hypothesis that meiotic gene conversion in wild-type yeast cells often results from the correction of heteroduplex DNA.\r"

The group consisted of 10 men and 3 women, aged 17 to 81 (mean, 55 years; median, 60 years). The lesions on CT were characteristically hyperdense, homogeneously contrast-enhancing, and associated with mild to moderate mass effect. Five patients had more than one lesion visible on CT. Complete staging procedures for occult systemic lymphoma were negative in all 13 patients. The majority (eight) of the tumors were of the diffuse, large-cell type. Five biopsy specimens underwent special immunostaining as a supplemental diagnostic effort. Two patients with small lymphocytic tumors demonstrated features consistent with T cell phenotype. Two patients with diffuse, large-cell tumors were confirmed as B cell phenotype by monotypic immunoglobulin light chain content. Primary CNS lymphomas represent a treatable group of primary brain tumors. Because of their tendency to develop in deep cerebral regions, they are often inaccessible to conventional neurosurgical techniques. We propose that stereotaxic neurosurgery can provide safe and accurate diagnosis, which is a prelude to planning comprehensive management.\r"

Complications (intrapartum fetal distress, traumatic deliveries, meconium aspiration, postmaturity syndrome) were significantly more frequent in patients in the study group (25.1%) than in the controls (5.6%). Similarly, fetal macrosomia occurred significantly more often in the study patients (29.6%) than in the controls (10.4%). To study the efficacy of antepartum surveillance in predicting these abnormal events, the postterm patients were randomized between two plans of management: 126 were followed with weekly nonstress testing (NST), and 117 with NST plus weekly ultrasound evaluation of fetal size, amniotic fluid volume, and placental grade. Contraction stress testing (CST) was used if the NST was nonreactive. Electronic monitoring had positive and negative predictive values of 42.8 and 87.7%, respectively, whereas ultrasound-plus-electronic monitoring had values of 50 and 65.3%, respectively. These results indicate that the increased incidence of complications in pregnancy prolonged beyond 40 weeks cannot be adequately predicted with antepartum electronic monitoring and ultrasound evaluation of fetal size, placental grade, and amniotic fluid volume.\r"

When growing in tissue culture medium, either organism significantly weakened the membranes as compared with controls (membranes incubated in the absence of either organism). Membranes derived from pregnancies delivered vaginally or abdominally responded similarly. When organisms were grown in bacteriologic medium, bursting pressures did not decrease. Addition of bacteriologic medium (20-60%) to tissue culture medium did not affect bacterial growth, but inhibited significantly the lowering of bursting pressures. Bacteriologic medium also inhibited the peroxidase-H2O2-halide system in vitro. Heat-killed bacteria and/or supernatants of culture medium previously inoculated with bacteria were not effective in weakening membranes. The results suggest that live bacteria in conjunction with active membrane metabolism lead to a weakening and eventual rupture of the membranes.\r"

To clarify the association between elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and low birth weight independent of maternal weight, we applied a weight correction formula to maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values from 9507 singleton viable pregnancies without major fetal malformations. Before adjusting for weight, 486 of the women (5.1%) had maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values of 2.0 or more multiples of the median. The weight adjustment process removed 100 lighter-weight women from this category, added 58 heavier women, and led to an equivalent proportion of women in the various weight categories who were classified as having maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values of 2.0 or more multiples of the median. Of the 388 low birth weight pregnancies (2500 g or less), 50 initially had maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values of 2.0 or more multiples of the median; after weight adjustment, seven lighter-weight women were removed, four heavier women were added, the median birth weight fell from 2217 to 1956 g, and a threefold increase in risk was found for low birth weight outcome regardless of weight class. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein elevations predict increased risk for low birth weight outcome independent of maternal weight.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind controlled study of the effects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual symptoms was conducted. Fifty-five women who reported moderate to severe premenstrual mood changes participated in the study. Symptoms were monitored prospectively through daily home record-keeping over a one-month baseline period followed by two months of treatment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily supplements of 150 mg of vitamin B6 or placebo over the entire two-month treatment period. Analysis of covariance suggested that even though vitamin B6 may improve premenstrual symptoms related to autonomic reactions (eg, dizziness and vomiting) and behavioral changes (eg, poor performance and decreased social activities), a significant amount of physical and affective symptomatology remained during the premenstrual phase. In light of recently reported, potentially toxic effects of low doses of vitamin B6, our results call for caution in using this therapy for premenstrual symptoms.\r"

Serum fructosamine levels in mothers of macrosomic infants were significantly higher (P less than .05) during the first trimester of pregnancy as compared with mothers of normal birth weight infants. Moreover, first-trimester fructosamine concentrations correlated significantly with birth weight (r = 0.68, P less than .001) and with ultrasound measurements of fetal abdominal circumference and femur length. The fetus destined to be macrosomic had an enlarged abdomen in the second trimester, often before 20 weeks' gestation. We conclude that maternal diabetic control during early gestation has an important influence on fetal growth and contributes to the development of fetal macrosomia.\r"

Twenty-six fetuses with open spina bifida were diagnosed. Values below the fifth percentile for gestation were found for biparietal diameter (BPD) in 17 fetuses (62%) and for head circumference in nine (35%). The anterior horn of the lateral cerebral ventricle/hemisphere ratio was above the 95th percentile in 11 (42%), and there was ventriculomegaly of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle in 14 (54%). Scalloping of the frontal bones, referred to as the \"lemon sign,\" was present in all 26 cases and also in five (1%) of the structurally normal fetuses. A cerebellar abnormality was found in 25 cases (96%). In nine fetuses (35%), the cerebellum was absent, and in 16 cases (62%), the cerebellar hemispheres curved anteriorly, producing the \"banana sign.\" The predictive ability of each ultrasound marker to detect open spina bifida was evaluated by measuring the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a positive and negative test. These findings demonstrated that certain cranial and cerebellar markers, in particular the lemon sign and the banana sign or absent cerebellum, are consistent features of open spina bifida and are likely to improve the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in the evaluation of pregnancies at high risk for this fetal abnormality.\r"

A separate comparison of the Doppler signals against real-time ultrasound observations of fetal activity showed that 913 of 970 visualized trunk movements (94%) were associated with Doppler signals. Other Doppler signals were found to be due principally to fetal breathing and fetal hiccups. Appropriate processing of the Doppler signals obtained during antenatal cardiotocography may allow an objective assessment of fetal activity to be added to the fetal heart rate recording.\r"

The normal position of the posterior portion of the heart can also be defined. The axis or position of the heart deviated from the established normal range in 15 cases, the outcome of which is discussed. Abnormal axis was associated with 50% mortality; abnormal position with 81% mortality. Deviation from the normal position of the fetal heart should initiate a search for an intrathoracic mass, whereas an abnormal axis is an indication for fetal echocardiography. Axis and position of the fetal heart are easily evaluated during a standard obstetric scan.\r"

Our understanding of dysgerminoma has improved, so that treatment schemes with better therapeutic ratio may now be used. Approximately 65% of patients present with stage IA disease. For those wishing to preserve fertility, conservative surgery with close clinical, radiologic, and serologic follow-up is the treatment of choice, with chemotherapy for relapse. Cure rates should approach 100%, and fertility is usually preserved. Intra-abdominal relapse in those not wishing to preserve fertility should be treated with modest-dose pelvic and abdominal irradiation. For those patients with disease presenting in stages IB, II, and III who wish to maintain fertility, unilateral oophorectomy followed by combination chemotherapy may be curative and spare ovarian function. Otherwise, complete surgery, followed by abdominopelvic radiation therapy, is recommended. This treatment produces less morbidity than chemotherapy and will cure approximately two-thirds of patients. Chemotherapy should be used for salvage of subsequent relapse. Both radiation and chemotherapy are highly effective treatment modalities for dysgerminoma. This information, coupled with better understanding of the patterns of disease spread and improved ability to identify nondysgerminomatous elements using serum tumor markers, means that a more conservative approach can be taken to management without compromising the chance of cure. Cure rates for dysgerminoma should now approach the role of 97% achieved in the comparable tumor, testicular seminoma.\r"

  ".W": "Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy is now the most common reason for penetrating keratoplasty. In previous reports, the type of intraocular lens (IOL) most frequently encountered in these eyes was the iris plane IOL. The authors reviewed 27 cases of IOL removal during penetrating keratoplasty. Lenses were removed if they were dislocated or associated with iritis, recurrent hyphema, glaucoma, or persistent cystoid macular edema. The IOL encountered most often was the anterior chamber lens (in 22 eyes); closed thin loop, semiflexible or flexible anterior chamber lenses accounted for 19 of these. Iris plane lenses were removed from five eyes. No posterior chamber lenses were removed. Clear grafts were obtained in 24 of 27 cases (89%); visual acuity improved or remained the same in 24 cases, to 20/60 in 11 cases. The most common causes of poor postoperative vision were retinal disease (6/27 cases) and glaucoma (6/27 cases). The association between anterior chamber lenses and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy is probably the result of both the increase in use of these lenses and the documented propensity of the closed loop semiflexible anterior chamber lenses to cause complications.\r"

  ".W": "Because the teeth are housed and develop within the jaws, skeletal development of the maxilla and mandible is a primary factor in the consideration of any problems pertaining to the developing dentition. Growth of the posterior nasal choanae, the maxilla, and the nasopharynx should be evaluated as a unit in assessing the favorable or unfavorable character of the nasopharyngeal region. Both large and small adenoidal tissues should be examined in light of the morphologic character of the nasopharynx (be it small, large, narrow, or wide) and related to the developing maxilla. Variables in size and location of the maxilla and the pharynx will play an important role in the impact that lymphoid tissue will have on the patency of the nasopharyngeal isthmus. Synchronized growth between the normally developing adenoids and the migration of the maxilla away from the cranial base will produce a balanced environment that precludes nasal obstruction by the presence of adenoids. With time, the changes in spatial relationships between the posterior border of the maxilla and the posterior pharyngeal wall plus atrophy of the adenoidal tissue will generally minimize or eliminate the problems of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing. Growth data may be used to evaluate the status, assess progress, measure comparability, determine inheritance patterns, and confer individuality. Unit-trait inheritance of the teeth, alveolar processes, maxilla, mandible, soft-tissue profile, tongue, pharynx, and lymphoid tissues may well produce more definitive answers to the question of the developing dentition and the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue. Finally, at present, no clinician can categorically state that enlarged tonsils or adenoids per se are responsible for abnormal dentition in the absence of other factors.\r"

Half of the siblings of these patients had concurrent nonbloody diarrhea. No source for infection with this organism was identified. Enteric infection with E coli O157:H7 occurs in the majority of cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome following diarrheal illness in the Pacific Northwest and may represent a previously overlooked cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in other locales. Evaluation of all cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome for enteric pathogens should routinely include cultures for E coli O157:H7 until results of additional studies clarify the distribution of agents associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome in different geographic regions. These findings may provide new opportunities for the design of therapeutic and preventive strategies in this disorder.\r"

Three studies of reliability are reported here, using raters who varied in level of educational preparation and geographic region. Two prospective studies of predictive validity were completed to determine the scale's sensitivity and specificity. Reliability ranged from r = .83 to r = .94 for nurses' aides and licensed practical nurses; when used by registered nurses, the reliability increased to r = .99. Predictive validity was calculated for each cut-off point of the scale. Using a cut-off point of 16, sensitivity was 100% in both studies. Specificity ranged from 64% to 90%. This instrument has highly satisfactory reliability when used by RNs, and greater sensitivity and specificity than instruments previously reported.\r"

The amino acid composition of the A and B subunits of SLT is very similar to that previously established for Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae 1, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the B subunit of SLT is identical with that reported for the B subunit of Shiga toxin. The genes for the A and B subunits of SLT apparently constitute an operon, with only 12 nucleotides separating the coding regions. There is a 21-base-pair region of dyad symmetry overlapping the proposed promoter of the slt operon that may be involved in regulation of SLT production by iron. The peptide sequence of the A subunit of SLT is homologous to the A subunit of the plant toxin ricin, providing evidence for the hypothesis that certain prokaryotic toxins may be evolutionarily related to eukaryotic enzymes.\r"

The promoter region was identified by nuclease S1 mapping with c-erbB-2 mRNA. Seven transcriptional start sites were identified. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region contains a \"TATA box\" and a \"CAAT box\" about 30 and 80 base pairs (bp), respectively, upstream of the most downstream RNA initiation site. Two putative binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 were identified about 50 and 110 bp upstream of the CAAT box, and six GGA repeats were found between the CAAT box and the TATA box. This region had strong promoter activity when placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transfected into monkey CV-1 cells. These data indicate that the promoter of the human c-erbB-2 protooncogene is different from that of the protooncogene c-erbB-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor gene), which does not contain either a TATA box or a CAAT box. Comparison of the promoter sequences and activities of the two protooncogenes should be helpful in analysis of the regulatory mechanism of expression of their gene products, which are growth-factor receptors.\r"

In a complex formed from purified alpha and epsilon subunits, polymerase activity increased 2-fold, and that of the 3'----5' exonuclease increased 10- to 80-fold. The alpha-epsilon complex contains one each of the subunits as does the core. Stimulation of 3'----5' exonuclease activity is due mainly to a greatly increased affinity of the epsilon subunit for the 3'-hydroxyl terminus, resulting from DNA binding by the alpha subunit. Proofreading in the course of DNA synthesis by the alpha-epsilon complex was indistinguishable from that of the core. These findings identify the participation of the alpha subunit in proofreading by polymerase III holoenzyme and suggest that the fidelity of DNA replication may be influenced by the relative levels of the alpha and epsilon subunits in the cell.\r"

The putrescine concentration in these mutants was found to be 1/2500th that in spe+ cells. The pathway of putrescine synthesis appears to be through the biodegradative arginine decarboxylase, which converts arginine to agmatine, in combination with a low agmatine ureohydrolase activity--1/2000th that in spe+ strains. These results suggest that even such low levels of polyamines permit a low level of protein synthesis. Evidence is presented that the polyamine requirement for the growth of the polyamine-dependent speAB, speC deletion mutants, which are also streptomycin resistant, is not due to a decreased ability to synthesize polyamines.\r"

Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from both proteins increased their immunoreactivities by 4- to 8-fold. Removal of these oligosaccharides also increased their specific biological activities about 20-fold, to reach approximately the specific activity of recombinant hGM-CSF from E. coli.

The stabilities were quantitatively examined except for the mutant protein substituted by arginine, which was not obtained in enough quantity.

The Gibbs energy of unfolding in water at pH 7.0 varied from 0.72 to 1.92 times that of the wild-type protein by the substitutions, but the activation Gibbs energy of unfolding in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride varied only from 0.95 to 1.03 times that of the wild-type protein. Moreover, the stability of the protein substituted at this position, which is buried in the interior of the molecule, tended to increase linearly with increasing hydrophobicity of the substituted residue, unless the volume of the substituted residue was over a certain limit.\r"

The organization and complete nucleotide sequence of the genes for these enzymes have been determined on a 4.2-kilobase-pair (kbp) Bgl II fragment cloned from the plasmid pAC27, based on the agreement of open reading frame lengths with apparent mobilities of polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli maxicells, predicted N-terminal amino acid sequences with those of the purified proteins, and predicted total amino acid compositions with those of the purified proteins. The 4.2-kbp fragment contains the three genes and ribosome binding sites for those genes but no promoter. When placed downstream of the tac promoter in the broad-host-range plasmid pMMB22, this fragment directs the synthesis of all three enzymes in both E. coli and Pseudomonas putida only on induction with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, suggesting that the gene cluster is regulated as a single unit under the control of a single promoter. Endogenous transcription initiation of the gene cluster on pAC27, however, occurs from a site present within a 386-bp Bgl II fragment upstream of the 4.2-kbp fragment, and sequences 5' to that site are similar to the sequences of other positively controlled Pseudomonas promoters occurring on the TOL and NAH plasmids.\r"

A trial structure in the form of a type I beta turn with asparagine side chains hydrogen-bonded to the backbone peptide linkages was used as a starting point. A repeating oligomer of this trial structure was modeled using energy minimization and molecular dynamics computer simulations in conjunction with image boundary conditions. The most stable structure generated is a right-handed 12(38) helix, which is unlike any previously identified protein secondary structure. The helix has 12 residues per turn, corresponding to an angle of twist of 120 degrees per tetrapeptide unit, and a pitch of 4.95 A, corresponding to a rise of 1.65 A per tetrapeptide unit. It is highly stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding, with each tetrapeptide unit acting as an acceptor for five hydrogen bonds and as a donor for five hydrogen bonds to residues in adjacent turns as well as having four weak internal hydrogen bonds. A number of nearly isoenergetic variations on the most stable structure that still retained the basic 12(38) helical motif were also discovered. The implications of these structures for vaccine development are discussed.\r"

While c-src transcripts were detected in myeloid leukemia cells representative of all stages of differentiation, the highly related gene c-fgr was expressed at high levels only at later developmental stages, both in normal cells committed to the monocytic lineage and in leukemic cells with a differentiated myelomonocytic phenotype. When bone marrow-derived monocytic cells were synchronized and stimulated to proliferate with CSF-1, c-fgr transcripts (but not transcripts from the highly related genes c-src or c-yes) were induced 8 hr after the addition of CSF-1 and decreased to low levels by 20 hr as the monocytic cells entered S phase. The selective induction of c-fgr mRNA by CSF-1 suggests that this tyrosine kinase may have a unique function in normal monocytic cells, distinct from other src-related tyrosine kinases.\r"

We have studied the heterogeneity of cellular growth rate and drug response in mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells and in NIH 3T3 cells transformed with the human HRAS gene (homologue of the Harvey sarcoma virus oncogene v-Ha-ras) from the EJ human bladder carcinoma cell line. Growth-rate heterogeneity was detected as a broad distribution of numbers of cells per colony. In spite of this heterogeneity, secondary colonies have numbers of cells per colony that resemble that of the primary colony from which they were derived. The variance between unrelated secondary colonies is increased by HRASEJ. Colony-size measurements are reliable because primary colonies divided in half formed two groups of secondary colonies (on two separate plates) that had indistinguishable mean colony sizes. Based on these observations, a divided-colony procedure was devised to detect the drug response of heterogeneous cell populations. Primary colonies are divided into two groups of cells, one of which is treated with a drug and the other is left untreated as a control. The size distribution of treated secondary colonies is then compared to that of the untreated control and to that of the primary colony from which it was derived. The divided-colony procedure is proposed as a modification of the human-tumor-cloning system to increase the sensitivity and reliability of in vitro procedures used to determine the drug response of heterogeneous tumor-cell populations.\r"

Analysis of purified populations of spermatogenic cell types detected c-mos RNA in the earliest haploid postmeiotic germ cell, the round spermatid, indicating that c-mos was expressed transiently during spermatogenesis. c-mos RNA was detected by blot hybridization in the ovaries of prepubertal mice and decreased in relative concentration following gonadotropin-stimulated proliferation of granulosa cells. These results suggested that c-mos was transcribed in oocytes and were confirmed by detection of high levels of c-mos RNA in isolated grown oocytes. Thus, c-mos is expressed in both male and female germ cells, suggesting possible roles for this protooncogene in meiosis, germ-cell development, fertilization, and early embryogenesis.\r"

Here we describe the development of typical hepatitis in two chimpanzees following intravenous inoculation with the medium in which the transfected cells had grown. The liver biopsies from these animals showed characteristic lesions in parenchyma and portal tracts, more conspicuous at an earlier time in the chimpanzee that had received a greater number of virions. The amount of HBsAg in the serum of one infected chimpanzee increased with time after the initial inoculation and then decreased concomitantly with the appearance of antibodies against HBsAg and core antigens. HBsAg remained detectable in the other animal throughout the course of the experiment. The levels of hepatitis B \"e\" antigen in both animals peaked at week 5, signifying the acute phase of the infection. The activities of serum enzymes that are markers for necroinflammation also increased. The hepatitis HBsAg subtype of the virions isolated from the patient whose DNA was cloned and then used for transfection of the Hep G2 cells was the same as that found in the chimpanzees. Furthermore, the restriction enzyme analysis of the viral DNA isolated from the chimpanzees was identical to the cloned DNA. Thus, HBV DNA-transfected Hep G2 cells can support the replication of virions that, in turn, produce hepatitis in chimpanzees.\r"

  ".U": "87260869\r", 
  ".W": "A single base mutation was constructed at position 1538 of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA, changing a cytidine to a uridine. This position is in the Shine-Dalgarno region, thought to be involved in base-pairing to mRNA during initiation of protein synthesis. The mutation was constructed by using a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide that differs in sequence by one base from the wild-type sequence of 16S rRNA. This oligonucleotide was used as a primer on single-stranded DNA of phage M13, into which was cloned a specific region of DNA encoding 16S rRNA. The mutation is lethal when expressed from the normal promoters of rRNA operons, P1 and P2, in a high-copy-number plasmid. Expression can be repressed by a temperature-sensitive repressor, cI857, in combination with the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter. Induction of transcription by temperature shift yields mutant 16S rRNA that is processed and assembled into functional ribosomal subunits. The presence of mutant ribosomes retards cell growth and dramatically alters incorporation of [35S]methionine into a large proportion of the cellular proteins. The change in level of synthesis of individual proteins correlates with the change in base-pairing between mutant rRNA and the Shine-Dalgarno region of the mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "87260870\r", 
  ".W": "In Escherichia coli, all mRNAs are translated by one pool of functionally identical ribosomes. Here, we describe a system in which a subpopulation of modified ribosomes are directed to a single mutated mRNA species. This was accomplished by changing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence that precedes the heterologous human growth hormone gene from 5' GGAGG to 5' CCTCC or 5' GTGTG. Translation of these modified mRNAs by wild-type ribosomes is very inefficient. When the anti-Shine-Dalgarno region (i.e., the region complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) at the 3' end of the gene encoding 16S rRNA (rrnB) was altered from 5' CCTCC to 5' GGAGG or 5' CACAC, thus restoring its potential to base-pair with the mutated human growth hormone mRNA, significant expression of this mRNA occurred. Growth hormone synthesis was dependent on induction of the mutated rrnB operon. Subsequently, these specialized ribosomes were made spectinomycin-resistant by the introduction of a C----U substitution at position 1192 of the 16S rRNA. Thus, host protein synthesis could be shut off by the addition of spectinomycin and the specificity and efficiency of the specialized ribosomes could be assessed. Since the specialized ribosomes represent a nonessential subpopulation in the cell, this system offers an approach to the study of mutations elsewhere in the 16S-rRNA gene that otherwise would be lethal to the cell.\r"

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of enzyme IIBgi, enzyme IIMtl, and enzyme IIGlc/enzyme IIIGlc, which catalyze the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of beta-glucosides, mannitol, and glucose, respectively, reveals considerable sequence homology. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal region of enzyme IIBgl is so homologous to the whole of enzyme IIIGlc as to suggest a common function. We postulate that His-547 of enzyme IIBgl receives a phosphate group directly from the cytoplasmic protein HPr and transfers this phosphate to His-306 located in the amino-terminal half of enzyme IIBgl. This latter histidine is conserved in enzyme IIBgl and enzyme IIGlc and, in both proteins, occurs in a region that shows homology with the His-15 region of HPr, which is known to act as the phosphate carrier. An equivalent histidine residue, His-195, is also present in enzyme IIMtl, although here the flanking sequence is different. None of these specified histidine residues is likely to be buried within the membrane.\r"

Under appropriate conditions this translocation depends on an interaction between the cell or particle surface and fibronectin. We now show that this interaction takes place at a site located within the first 31 kDa of the amino-terminal end of the fibronectin molecule. Using defined fibronectin fragments and monoclonal antibodies directed against specific fibronectin domains, this site is established as both necessary and sufficient for the promotion of matrix-driven translocation. Competition experiments using heparin, heparan sulfate, and other sulfated polysaccharides show that this fibronectin site interacts with heparin-like cell or particle surface components in promoting matrix-driven translocation. Treatment of cells with heparinase renders them unresponsive to the translocational effect. An antibody directed against the amino-terminal domain of fibronectin completely inhibits matrix-driven translocation without interfering with heparin binding, suggesting that a post-binding conformational change in fibronectin may be required for promotion of the effect.\r"

The mechanism(s) by which protease inhibitors suppress carcinogenesis, however, is not fully understood. Presumably, these agents inhibit one or more intracellular proteases whose functions are essential for the induction and/or expression of the transformed phenotype. We have isolated an endopeptidase activity capable of hydrolyzing the substrate Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA (Boc = butoxycarbonyl; MCA = 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) from C3H/10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast cells. This intracellular protease was inhibited by the soybean-derived Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI), chymostatin, and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, all of which have anticarcinogenic activity, but was unaffected by soybean trypsin inhibitor, which lacks anticarcinogenic activity. Other protease inhibitors affected the proteolytic activity to an extent that correlates with their relative ability to suppress transformation in vitro. The enzyme has a mass of about 70 kDa, contains a single subunit, and exhibits maximal activity at pH 7.0. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate covalently binds to this enzyme and blocks its activity, indicating that the enzyme is a serine protease. We have previously demonstrated that several protease inhibitors are effective suppressors of radiation-induced transformation of C3H/10T1/2 cells. Since these agents reduce the Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA-hydrolyzing activity to an extent that correlates with their ability to inhibit malignant transformation in vitro, this endopeptidase activity may be a cellular target of the anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors.\r"

Normal stability of an untranslated bla gene mRNA segment required its linkage to a ribosome-bound segment of bla gene mRNA. These findings indicate that depriving an mRNA segment of ribosomes does not necessarily render it more susceptible to degradation.

Addition of a large polyvalent anion to the medium bathing a phospholipid bilayer containing the voltage-dependent channel from the mitochondrial outer membrane, VDAC, induced up to a 12-fold increase in the channel's voltage sensitivity. The highest polyvalent anion concentration tested resulted in an e-fold conductance change for a 0.36-mV change in membrane potential. On the low end, a concentration of 2 microM resulted in a 50% increase in VDAC voltage dependence. A mechanism based on polyvalent anion accumulation in the access resistance region at the mouth of the pore is consistent with all findings. Perhaps the voltage dependence of voltage-gated channels is amplified in vivo by polyvalent ions. If so, the control of excitable phenomena may be under much finer regulation than that provided by membrane potential alone.\r"

The virus genome contains both viral and nonviral, cell-related sequences; the nonviral sequence has been designated v-akt, the presumed viral oncogene of the AKT8 virus. This gene lacks homology to the 16 other oncogenes tested. The cloned provirus has undergone a partial deletion, during cell passage in vitro, that prevents direct demonstration of the transforming ability of this molecular clone. Two human homologues of the v-akt oncogene, AKT1 and AKT2, were cloned. A survey of 225 human tumors for changes involving AKT1 led to the discovery of a 20-fold amplification of this gene in one of the five gastric adenocarcinomas tested. The results demonstrate that AKT8 has the characteristic structure of a directly transforming retrovirus and that it contains a gene derived from highly conserved cellular sequences that may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Phencyclidine (PCP) and some of its pharmacological congeners inhibit the signal transduction at specific excitatory amino acid receptors of cerebellar granule cells in primary cultures. These drugs do not bind to the transmitter recognition sites, and affinity of this specific binding site is increased by the presence of the transmitter bound to its recognition sites. PCP inhibits phosphatidylinositol phosphate hydrolysis mediated by Mg2+-sensitive glutamate receptors (GP1) but not that mediated by Mg2+-insensitive glutamate receptors (GP2). In addition, PCP inhibits Ca2+ influx and cGMP formation mediated by the activation of Mg2+-sensitive glutamate receptors (GC1) but not that mediated by Mg2+-insensitive glutamate receptors (GC2). In this cell culture the activation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate hydrolysis by muscarinic receptor agonists is not affected by PCP. Since PCP inhibits noncompetitively GP1 and GC1 signal transduction it may act as a negative allosteric modulator of signal transduction at both receptors. The pharmacological profile of PCP and its congeners delimits a class of drugs modulating allosterically the action of the primary transmitter at GP1 and GC1 receptors. These drugs need the presence of the transmitter to act and they cannot be termed inverse agonists because they are devoid of activity in the absence of the transmitter; moreover, they do not bind to the transmitter recognition site nor do they prevent the transmitter binding to its recognition sites.\r"

The hybrid is processed normally into alpha and hybrid beta subunits, is expressed on the cell surface at high levels, and binds insulin with near-wild-type affinity. Furthermore, insulin stimulates the phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the hybrid beta subunit in vivo and the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate [poly(Glu,Tyr)] in vitro. Thus the hybrid is capable of heterologous transmembrane signaling. However, the hybrid mediates neither the insulin-activated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose nor the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, suggesting that the physiological response(s) mediated by ligand-activated protein-tyrosine kinases may utilize distinct intracellular mechanisms for postreceptor signaling.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and sequenced cDNAs for corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) prepared from human liver and lung mRNAs. Our results indicate that CBG mRNA is relatively abundant in the liver but is also present in the lung, testis, and kidney. The liver CBG cDNA contains an open reading frame for a 405-amino acid (Mr 45,149) polypeptide. This includes a predominantly hydrophobic, leader sequence of 22 residues that precedes the known NH2-terminal sequence of human CBG. We, therefore, predict that the mature protein is composed of 383 amino acids and is a polypeptide of Mr 42,646. A second, in-frame, 72-base-pair cistron of unknown significance exists between the TAA termination codon for CBG and a possible polyadenylylation signal (AATAAA) located 16 nucleotides before the polyadenylylation site. The deduced amino acid sequence of mature CBG contains two cysteine residues and consensus sequences for the attachment of six possible N-linked oligosaccharide chains. The sequences of the human lung and liver CBG cDNAs differ by only one nucleotide within the proposed leader sequence, and we attribute this to a point mutation. No sequence homology was found between CBG and other steroid binding proteins, but there is a remarkable similarity between the amino acid sequences of CBG and of alpha 1-antitrypsin, and this extends to other members of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily.\r"

The three B. licheniformis substitutions (Ser-156/Ala-169/Leu-217) were introduced into the wild-type B. amyloliquefaciens subtilisin (Glu-156/Gly-169/Tyr-217) by site-directed mutagenesis. The substrate specificity of the triple mutant approaches that of B. licheniformis enzyme when assayed with seven different substrates that vary in charge, size, and hydrophobicity. Thus, specificity properties of distantly related and functionally divergent enzymes can be exchanged by limited amino acid replacements, in this case representing less than 4% of the sequence differences.\r"

The majority of the 5' ends map within a large open reading frame between two in-frame ATGs at positions +1 and +49. A small fraction of the 5' ends are located upstream of the first ATG. Both AUGs of the TRM1 mRNAs are used to initiate translation, and two forms of N2,N2-dimethylguanosine-specific tRNA methyltransferase, which differ by an amino-terminal extension of 16 amino acids, are made. Mitochondrial tRNAs are modified when the initiation of translation is limited to one or the other of the AUGs, suggesting that the amino-terminal extension is not necessary for import of the protein into mitochondria. Mitochondrial targeting information must, therefore, be located in a region of N2,N2-dimethylguanosine-specific tRNA methyltransferase that is found in both forms of the enzyme.\r"

The gene encoding C62.5 (named htpG) is located between the dnaZ and adk genes at 11.1 minutes on the E. coli chromosome. The htpG gene appears to be a newly identified locus.

The gene also activates the transcription of the same operon in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol, but for this activation another regulatory gene, xylR, is required. In this study we examined the xylS expression by determining the mRNA by reverse transcriptase mapping and by monitoring the enzyme activity of the xylE gene product, which was expressed under the control of the xylS promoter. The results of the above experiments provide evidence that xylR positively controls the transcription of xylS in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. The xylS product thus amplified may in turn activate the xylDLEGF operon. The nucleotide sequence of the xylS promoter resembles that of the promoter of the xylCAB operon for the m-xylene-degrading pathway, which is also activated by xylR in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. In addition, we have demonstrated that the expression of xylR is negatively controlled by its own product. On the basis of these findings, we propose a revised model for the regulation of expression of xyl genes on the TOL plasmid.\r"

We have purified pro-OmpA to determine which additional soluble proteins are necessary for its membrane assembly. [35S]Pro-OmpA was bound to Sepharose-linked antibody to OmpA, then eluted with 8 M urea and chromatographed on an anion-exchange resin in 8 M urea. This pro-OmpA is purified 2000-fold and is radiochemically pure. After dialysis, it is soluble but incompetent for membrane assembly. Addition of an Escherichia coli cytoplasmic fraction (S100) to the assembly reaction does not allow translocation. However, when S100 is added to pro-OmpA prior to dialysis, full assembly competence is restored, suggesting that a soluble factor, termed \"trigger factor,\" triggers the folding of pro-OmpA into an assembly-competent form as the urea is removed. We noted that, prior to the last purification step, the immunoaffinity-purified pro-OmpA was partially competent for membrane assembly without addition of trigger factor. To test whether trigger factor had bound to the antibody column by means of its association with pro-OmpA, the crude pro-OmpA was acid-denatured prior to immunoadsorption. In this experiment, the trigger factor did not bind to the anti-OmpA column, and S100 was required for renaturation of this [35S]pro-OmpA. As suggested by this experiment, the crude [35S]pro-OmpA was in a complex with other proteins. Sedimentation velocity studies showed that the trigger factor has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 60,000. We propose that it is required for translocation-competent folding of pro-OmpA and other precursor proteins.\r"

After transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells with this construct, seven cell lines expressing insulin receptors were isolated; two cell lines had more than 10(6) receptors per cell. The cell line with the highest insulin binding (NIH 3T3 HIR3.5) had 6 X 10(6) receptors with a Kd of 10(-9) M. This level was not dependent on exposure to metals but could be increased further to 2 X 10(7) receptors per cell by addition of sodium butyrate to the culture medium. The alpha and beta subunits had apparent molecular weights of 147,000 and 105,000, respectively (compared to 135,000 and 95,000 in IM-9 human lymphocytes), values identical to those of the alpha and beta subunits of the insulin receptors of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells. This size difference was due to altered carbohydrate composition, as N-glycanase digestion reduced the apparent receptor subunit size of the transfected cells and IM-9 lymphocytes to identical values. The alteration in N-linked oligosaccharide composition could not be ascribed to differences in the kinetics of posttranslational processing of the insulin receptors, which was comparable to that of other cells studied. The basal rate of glycogen synthesis in the cells overexpressing insulin receptors was increased 4- to 5-fold compared with controls. Low levels of added insulin (0.1 nM) caused a 50% increase in the rate of glycogen synthesis.\r"

The arbors were established by extension of processes and resembled dendrites. We used this system to study the regulation of cell shape. alpha-MSH is known to induce increases in cAMP levels, and agents such as forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine that led to increased cAMP also caused arborization. However, equally dramatic arbors were formed after incubation with the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-alpha-methyl-piperazine]. Phorbol diesters that activate protein kinase C led to cell rounding and antagonized alpha-MSH. The actions of protein kinase C cannot be rationalized in terms of indirect effects on cAMP: neither H-7 nor phorbol diesters alone altered cAMP levels, nor did they affect the increase in cAMP induced by MSH. We show also that MSH produced longer-term effects that cannot be mimicked by cAMP. Specifically, even in the continued presence of alpha-MSH, arborization was followed by morphological reversal to the unstimulated flattened configuration within 2 hr. (This did not occur with other agents that increase cAMP or with H-7.) Most importantly, whereas MSH-induced arborization occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, actinomycin D, or in enucleated cells, the reversal of arborization did not. Thus, MSH induced a program of rapid shape change that was dependent on new protein synthesis and gene transcription.\r"

Serologic analysis using a monoclonal antibody against purified recombinant interleukin 1 alpha proved conclusively that the potentiating activity in HBT 5637 serum-free supernatants is due to interleukin 1 alpha.

In nine such regrown neurites analyzed for microtubule polarity, the + ends of microtubules faced the newly formed growth cones, i.e.,--ends of microtubules were now at the original distal terminal of the neuron. These results indicate that microtubules reorganized concomitant with neurite regrowth to form a uniformly polar microtubule array but with reversed polarity. This suggests that mechanisms within the neurite, independent of the cell body, are sufficient for organization of microtubule assembly during axonal elongation. Our data also indicate that microtubule + ends were correlated with growth cone formation in the following three experimental classes of neurites: normal, regrown, and amputated but extended. We speculate that + ends of microtubules are a requirement for growth cone formation and advance.\r"

Using probes and synthetic peptides derived from the Hox 1.1 sequence, we were able to isolate cDNAs and antibodies that allowed us to characterize the product of this homeobox-containing gene. From the open reading frame on the cDNA clone B21, a protein could be predicted, made up of 229 amino acids and having a calculated molecular weight of 25,740. A unique feature of this protein is that it has 15 glutamic acid residues as its carboxyl terminus, which gives it a very hydrophilic and acidic carboxyl terminal structure, most probably folding onto an alpha-helix. A second domain of six amino acids is present on the Hox 1.1 protein, which is conserved in other homeodomain proteins. Antibodies generated against synthetic peptides from the homeobox region were used in the immunoblotting procedure and revealed a major protein band of Mr 31,000 in extracts from 3T3 cells and F9 teratocarcinoma cells induced by retinoic acid and cAMP. The nuclear location of the protein was established by immunofluorescence.

  ".W": "A family of peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity has been isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. It consists of two closely related peptides that are each 23 amino acids and differ by two substitutions. These peptides are water soluble, nonhemolytic at their effective antimicrobial concentrations, and potentially amphiphilic. At low concentrations they inhibit growth of numerous species of bacteria and fungi and induce osmotic lysis of protozoa. The sequence of a partial cDNA of the precursor reveals that both peptides derive from a common larger protein. These peptides appear to represent a previously unrecognized class of vertebrate antimicrobial activities.\r"

Thirty-nine patients, 14 male and 25 female, underwent the procedure. Average operating time was 43 minutes (range 15 to 70 minutes). Perioperative pain was remarkably mild, and patient satisfaction was extremely high, even among patients unhappy from previous chin implants. The overall complication rate was 20 percent, including two wound infections and one mental nerve injury. Both wound infections resolved uneventfully without detracting from the final result. Neither bleeding nor airway problems were encountered. An osseus genioplasty is a useful technique for correction of the hypoplastic chin. This technique may be performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia with minimum pain and excellent patient acceptance. In light of the low risk and favorable results from this procedure, we recommend this technique as a practical alternative to alloplastic chin augmentation in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that experimental vascularized bone allografts are subject to host rejection. To be useful clinically, this rejection response would need to be controlled. Cyclosporin is a potent immunosuppressant whose precise role in vascularized bone allograft transplantation has not been established. Using a proven reliable vascularized knee allograft model in inbred rats, cyclosporin was used postoperatively both continuously and short term (14 days after transplant) at 10 mg/kg per day as recipient treatment. Across a strong histocompatibility barrier, continuous cyclosporin was required for long-term graft survival. Short-term therapy delayed rejection for 4 to 6 weeks. However, across a weak histocompatibility barrier, short-term therapy was as effective as continuous therapy in achieving long-term graft survival. The implication is that a limited course of cyclosporin may be clinically successful in sustaining vascularized bone allograft survival, provided the genetic disparity between graft and host has been minimized by genetic matching techniques.\r"

Ph. D. authorship was associated with increased percentage of articles using statistical analysis. When compared with general surgery articles, plastic surgery articles performed four times fewer statistical analyses. However, when statistical analyses were performed, there were few differences between these two specialties. Although there were no differences in the types of statistical analysis errors, there were differences in the types of study design errors. The causes of these discrepancies may lie in the nature of plastic surgery; they may be reduced by adherence to Feinstein's principles of study design and result interpretation.\r"

Patients will look to their personal physician for advice in dealing with their illness and commonly ask, \"What would you do?\" Knowing the patient well, whether he or she desires to fight for every possible day of life or apparently welcomes an earlier death with freedom from life prolongation therapies, is the basis for helping the patient to choose alternatives. Informed decisions by the physician are facilitated by appropriate classification and staging of the tumor. Entrusted to the primary physician are numerous responsibilities that include team management, aiding the patient and family to cope with the illness, and maintaining a quality life with the best possible functional status. Both patient and physician must fully understand and share what is known about the cancer in order to individualize treatment with the proper level of care. Modern cancer care is highly sophisticated and changeable; to do it well requires a special interest and attention from the physician.\r"

For many of these tumors, appropriate screening holds greater promise than improved cures for decreasing mortality rates. Screening of asymptomatic patients can be associated with significant costs, both financial and emotional. Excessively rigorous screening efforts can alienate patients from the concept of early diagnosis and may even cause them to avoid seeking other needed medical care. Failure to screen adequately may result in unnecessary loss of life from potentially curable tumors. Because of the complexities involved in carrying out adequate randomized controlled trials of various cancer-screening methods, recommendations must necessarily be based on incomplete information. Although there is room for disagreement among authors and organizations formulating screening plans, the recommendations of the ACS were selected and reproduced in this article. A review of other recommendations is available.\r"

Nondrug therapies are tried first. When drugs must be used, the pain is treated by regular dosing to prevent recurrent breakthroughs--no PRN orders are used. The pain is blocked and its memory erased so that continued, uninterrupted relief is given. Drug management should provide ease of administration to maintain patient independence, unclouded and normal affect, and minimal troublesome side effects. Anticipatory treatment of expected problems with constipation and nausea should be done. By using a reproducible pain measurement scale, titration of drugs is carried out in a stepwise fashion, increasing dosage or potency until the desired effect is achieved. With multimode therapy, no patient should have to suffer the aching/agony pain cycle of terminal illness with cancer.\r"

Medical attention to these discomforts will help the patient and family to cope better with the dying process.\r"

Rehabilitation may be preventive, restorative, supportive, or palliative, depending on the type and stage of the disease and characteristics of the patient. Rehabilitation is most effectively planned and carried out by a team composed of various disciplines, as appropriate, but always with the patient and family as the central members of the team. Patients need to be well-informed about the illness and treatment from an early stage and assisted in learning methods to deal with problems they may face in areas such as coping, independent functioning, sexual functioning, employment, and financial pressures. The physician can provide the most effective care to the patient by being familiar with and involving the wide range of rehabilitation services, community support programs, and necessary resources. Through these services, patients can be helped to lead productive and satisfying lives.\r"

Histologically, several specific types could be distinguished: lymphangioma, 19 cases; nonpancreatic pseudocyst, 11 cases; enteric duplication cyst, six cases; mesothelial cyst, three cases; and enteric cyst, two cases. A lymphangioma is usually a multiloculated cyst located in the mesentery that shows no discernible wall on computed tomography (CT) and may have characteristics of fat on CT and magnetic resonance imaging. Abnormalities in the small bowel mucosa were frequently noted on barium studies. A nonpancreatic pseudocyst is usually a unilocular or multilocular cyst located in either the mesentery or the omentum, with abundant debris sonographically and an enhancing wall on CT. An enteric duplication cyst is a unilocular cyst with an enhancing wall on CT. Mesothelial and enteric cysts are anechoic, thin-walled cysts. Emphasis is placed on the importance of identifying lymphangioma, which is more difficult to manage than the other forms of mesenteric and omental cysts.\r"

Various flow rates were produced by the infusion of dopamine. Splenic artery blood flow and superior mesenteric artery blood flow measured with the duplex system exhibited significant correlations with corresponding values obtained with electromagnetic flow measurements (r = .93 and r = .93, respectively). Changes in splanchnic circulation with the progression of chronic liver disease in humans were then investigated with the use of the duplex system. Splenic artery blood flow and superior mesenteric artery blood flow were significantly increased in patients with cirrhosis compared with patients with chronic hepatitis and healthy subjects.

US findings alone could not be used to make a specific prediction of malignant disease or to classify a neoplasm histologically. However, different kinds of tumors exhibited characteristic echomorphologic features that corresponded to their gross morphologic appearance; a knowledge of these echomorphologic features is extremely useful for the US differentiation of tumors from nonneoplastic scrotal pathologic conditions. All neoplasms in this series displayed distinct abnormalities in parenchymal texture, and all were detected with US. The sensitivity and predictive value of a normal sonogram were as high as 100%. With regard to the detection of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases from testicular tumors, abdominal US had an overall accuracy rate of 96% and was of superior diagnostic value compared with bipedal lymphangiography.\r"

In the third trimester, a decrease in size was documented regardless of initial size. The most common patterns of echotexture were hypoechoic, heterogeneous, and echogenic rim. The development of a heterogeneous pattern or anechoic/cystic spaces on a follow-up study was accompanied in seven of ten patients by severe abdominal pain, compared with 12 cases of abdominal pain in 103 patients without such echotexture changes. Although the number of patients was small, the development of these patterns apparently indicates significant degeneration of the fibroid. Fibroids located in the lower uterine segment were accompanied by a higher frequency of cesarean section and retained placenta. Fibroids located in the uterine corpus were more frequently associated with early abortions. Multiple fibroids were accompanied by a higher frequency of malpresentation and premature contractions compared with cases with one or two fibroids.\r"

In marked hypertriglyceridemia, where there is an accumulation of chylomicrons, platelet function is reduced. Treatment, whether by diet, medication, or plasmapheresis, that will result in a change in lipoprotein pattern is accompanied by a parallel change in platelet responsiveness. Incubation of lipoproteins with isolated platelets results in enhancement of platelet activation by LDL and VLDL and suppression of activity by HDL and chylomicrons. These findings have in vivo confirmation. They are even more pronounced and sometimes altered when the lipoproteins are derived from hyperlipidemic subjects. The effects of the lipoproteins on platelet activity appear to be dependent on lipoprotein composition and on factors such as cholesterol:protein ratio, apo C-III0:apo C-III2 ratio, apo B concentration, and triglyceride:protein ratio. The lipoproteins interact with platelets at specific receptor sites. Rapid change in platelet composition, particularly with regard to cholesterol, phospholipid, and fatty acid content, might ensue, with consequent alterations in membrane fluidity and enzyme activities and either suppression or activation of platelet function. This review has indicated that lipoproteins have a clear influence on platelet function. This interaction could be well of paramount importance in determining atherogenic risk.\r"

Delusions of parasitosis can exist as an isolated psychosis or as part of a much more complicated medical and/or psychiatric illness. To diagnose these patients, physicians must be familiar with the patterns of presentation usually seen in patients with delusions of parasitosis and must be confident that other psychiatric and/or medical conditions that could be causing the symptoms--including true parasitosis--have been ruled out. Clinical signs, such as the presence of cutaneous lesions on exposed and accessible parts of the body (wounds self-inflicted in efforts to extricate parasites with needles, knives, or fingernails), and behavioral signs, such as the collection of bottles and jars purported to contain samples of the parasites, are characteristic. These patients can be rigid, antagonistic, distant, and demanding; they may write long letters to physicians describing their parasites in detail, enclosing drawings or samples. Psychotherapy, with or without confrontational denial, has a reported efficacy of approximately 10%; placebo therapy is usually not recommended. The recent application of a new neuroleptic agent, pimozide, to the treatment of this disorder is controversial and a new neuroleptic agent, pimozide, to the treatment of this disorder is controversial and needs further study. Guidelines for an appropriate approach to patients with delusions of parasitosis include the necessity of identifying medical or psychiatric disease, if present, and of listening carefully to the patient's history.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The major issues for AIDS research during the next few years must be practical ones: the development of a safe, effective vaccine for individuals not yet infected with the causative virus and the development of drug therapies for those already infected. Suitable animal models will be needed for studies designed to achieve these goals. Areas of investigation in animal models can be divided into four categories on the basis of increasing direct relevance to AIDS in humans: retroviruses that have no obvious, close relation to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but can induce chronic diseases with manifestations that include immunologic abnormalities; ungulate lentiviruses; HIV-related viruses of Old World primates; and HIV infection of chimpanzees. It is hoped that important research developments in experimental models can be quickly extrapolated to human AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "The inclusion of subtherapeutic doses of antimicrobial agents in animal feed is credited for having contributed to lower costs of meat, milk, and eggs. The practice often is associated with the acquisition of resistant enteric flora by the involved animals, a phenomenon that in turn may contribute to the human reservoir of coliforms and salmonellae resistant to antimicrobial agents. Farm workers may transiently acquire resistant intestinal flora and on rare occasions develop salmonellosis. Although irrefutable evidence of the growth-promoting properties of antibiotics in animal feed was provided 30-40 years ago, additional studies--with a focus on mechanisms of the effect--are presently needed. It may be possible to identify factors effective in promoting growth without deleterious effects on the intestinal flora. A national program of surveillance of antimicrobial administration (in both subtherapeutic and therapeutic doses) to food-producing animals should be established. Molecular epidemiologic research efforts must be undertaken to determine whether genetic information of animal origin contributes significantly to the human environmental pool of antimicrobial resistance. In the meantime, it does not appear that the banning of drugs as feed additives, with concomitant unrestricted use of these agents for the treatment of both animals and people, would favorably influence the problems of antimicrobial resistance and salmonellosis in human populations.\r"

Virtually all adults have been infected, as is demonstrated by the presence of serum antibodies, but previous infection does not protect against new infection with the same or a different serotype. Rotaviral infection of adults is seen in five settings: secondary contacts from pediatric cases, with variable attack rates in adults; waterborne outbreaks, which are often characterized by higher attack rates in adults than in children; travelers' diarrhea; epidemic spread in isolated or closed populations, often in the absence of contact with children; and endemic infections, which may account for 5%-10% of sporadic cases of diarrhea in adults. Frequent asymptomatic infections with rotavirus occur, and they may be important in the epidemiology of the disease. Although rotaviral infections in adults tend to be milder than those in children, death due to rotaviral infection in adults have been reported.\r"

  ".U": "87262866\r", 
  ".W": "Bacterial adherence to the uroepithelium is recognized as an important mechanism in the initiation and pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTI). The uropathogens originate predominantly in the intestinal tract and initially colonize the periurethral region and ascend into the bladder, resulting in symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Thereafter, depending on host factors and bacterial virulence factors, the organisms may further ascend and give rise to pyelonephritis. Uropathogens are selected by the presence of virulence characteristics that enable them to resist the normally efficient host defense mechanisms. Considerable progress has been made in identifying bacterial adhesins and in demonstrating bacterial receptor sites on uroepithelial surfaces. Recent studies have identified natural anti-adherence mechanisms in humans as well as possible increased susceptibility to UTI when these mechanisms are defective and when receptor density on uroepithelial cells is altered. Knowledge of bacterial adherence mechanisms may permit alternative methods of prevention and management of urinary infection, including the use of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics, vaccine development, nonimmune inhibition of bacterial adhesins and receptor sites, and the use of autochthonous flora, such as lactobacilli, to exclude uropathogens from colonizing the urinary tract.\r"

Microorganisms may act cooperatively, with the occurrence of infection resulting from their joint action. Alternatively, each organism of the infecting inoculum may independently possess the potential to cause infection, and, with an inoculum size approximating the 50% infectious dose, infection may result from the survival and multiplication of a single organism. Several lines of experimental data involving several bacterial species strongly support the independent-action, or \"single-organism,\" hypothesis of the pathogenesis of colonization and infection. Available data also support the independent-action hypothesis in the pathogenesis of experimental viral infections. This hypothesis provides an explanation for the occurrence of sporadic episodes of infection.\r"

When young mice born to pregnant mice immunized with a polysaccharide-protein conjugate (e.g., 19F polysaccharide-human IgG) are given an additional dose of polysaccharide-protein conjugate immunogen, they develop an antibody response stronger than that of young mice not receiving additional immunogen. Injection of female mice (before their mating) with type 19F or type 3 polysaccharide may also induce a stronger antibody response in offspring. Combined passive immunization with immunoglobulin and active immunization do not cause suppression or observable harmful immunologic effects; rather, such immunization may elicit sufficient 19F antibody formation for protection against infection during early life. IgG receptor molecules have been isolated from rabbit yolk-sac membranes, and their physicochemical properties have been characterized.\r"

Many of these persons request rabies prophylaxis, and their physicians prescribe it because of their insecurity, a situation that is expensive and often unnecessary. Records of the Centers for Disease Control and the literature were reviewed to examine the current practice of prophylaxis of contacts and the actual need for it. Rabies virus is present in a variety of human fluids and tissues during the first five weeks of illness, but there are only four well-documented reports of human-to-human transmission--all in corneal transplant recipients. Prophylaxis of contacts of 14 rabid patients was predominantly for saliva exposure to open wounds or mucous membranes and was given most often to medical personnel having the greatest contact with the patient. Although it has never been documented, human-to-human transmission of rabies following saliva exposure remains a theoretical possibility. Virus shedding by rabid patients should be studied thoroughly in the future. Recommendations for managing contacts of rabid patients are presented.\r"

The drug has a long half-life (16 hr) in humans and a marked tissue tropism, with tissue levels five- to 10-fold higher than that in the serum. In animals rifabutin is no more toxic than rifampin. A large experience from the compassionate use of rifabutin for life-threatening mycobacterial infections in humans, most commonly disseminated M. avium complex disease in patients with AIDS, has also indicated relative drug safety.

  ".W": "Hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies were raised to enterotoxins of the cholera family and to chimeric B-subunit proteins in which individual amino acid residues of a heat-labile, cholera-related enterotoxin from an Escherichia coli strain of porcine origin (P-LT) were substituted with corresponding residues from such an enterotoxin from an E. coli strain of human origin (H-LT). Single amino acid substitutions were found to have profound effects on the physicochemical behavior of the proteins and on their immunologic reactivity. With the use of enzyme-linked immunosorption assays (ELISAs) with and without the GM1 ganglioside receptor for these toxins, several distinct epitopes in GM1-binding domains were identified by different monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to synthetic peptides of the cholera enterotoxin B subunit were cross-reactive to various degrees with the proteins in our library, which include two different cholera enterotoxins, two H-LTs, P-LT, and four chimeric proteins. Some of these reactions were blocked by GM1 ganglioside but not by the oligosaccharide of GM1, a finding suggesting that the peptides generated antibodies to epitopes near, but not in, a GM1-binding domain. A hypothetical evolutionary tree based on the reported amino acid sequences of the various enterotoxins is constructed. As additional enterotoxins are described, it will be interesting to determine if and where they fit in this scheme.\r"

However, evidence has been accumulating that this conventional view is wrong and that an environmental nonhuman source is critical to some human infections with Mycobacterium leprae. Observations, some of which date back to the nineteenth century, support soil, vegetation, water, arthropods, and armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) as environmental sources of leprosy. Disparate clinical, epidemiologic, and microbiologic evidence has been critically reviewed in light of the fact that 50%-70% of sporadic cases of leprosy in well-studied populations occur in persons who have had no known contact with human leprosy. Historical data and current information alike substantiate the concept of nonhuman sources of the disease; recent observations with monoclonal antibody have shown that phenolic glycolipid-I antigen, which is unique to the M. leprae cell wall, is present in soil. In the absence of a technique for in vitro cultivation, indirect methods and the body of observations reviewed here persuasively favor but do not prove the existence of environmental nonhuman sources of M. leprae.\r"

  ".U": "87262876\r", 
  ".W": "Leprosy is generally accepted as being caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an acid-fast organism often present in great numbers in certain forms of leprosy. However, it has not been possible to confirm with scientifically acceptable evidence that this entity is the cause of leprosy; laboratory cultivation, an essential factor in the proof, has not been accomplished with the acid-fast bodies seen in leprotic tissue. The mechanisms of transmission of the disease also remain conjectural; prolonged, close contact and transmission by nasal droplet have both been proposed, and, while the latter fits the pattern of disease, both remain unproved. It is proposed that the causative agent of leprosy is not a difficult-to-transmit agent but, rather, an organism that has evolved a highly efficient state of parasitism in stable types of populations and that everyone in the population harbors the leprosy parasite at some time. The majority of the population incubate subclinical infections at various levels; clinical leprosy arises from within the pool of subclinical infection in the endemic population rather than by transmission from an index case. A theory of complete infection of endemic populations is consistent with the rate of development and distribution of positive lepromin reactions among healthy persons in endemic regions and provides an explanation for the difficulty in controlling leprosy in endemic populations by isolation of patients or by therapy for clinical cases.\r"

  ".W": "During the past five years, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has become recognized as a major form of therapy for end-stage renal disease. Despite continued advances, peritonitis remains a major limiting factor in the widespread application of CAPD. The pathogenesis of CAPD peritonitis is strikingly different from that of surgical peritonitis. Not only are the sources of infection and the microbiologic findings dissimilar, but the severity of infection is markedly different. Moreover, in CAPD peritonitis, both biofilms (extracellular slime substances) associated with microbial growth on the implanted silicone catheter and compromised local defenses (depletion of opsonins and intracellular survival of certain microorganisms) are of pathogenic importance. Once the diagnosis of peritonitis is suspected, therapy should be instituted immediately. However, the optimal antibiotic regimen and the best route, dose, and duration of antibiotic administration remain unknown because of a paucity of randomized, controlled studies. New approaches to the prevention and treatment of CAPD peritonitis are being evaluated; if this infection can be successfully managed, CAPD promises to become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic renal failure.\r"

Marshall Fabyan, who was the moving spirit behind the affair, also designed an eight-inch by ten-inch souvenir card on which twenty-six sketches depicted Smith's signal researches. This previously unpublished card is reproduced in the present paper, and a digest of the work represented by each sketch is provided. Collectively these summaries are evidence of the remarkable range of Smith's accomplishments, and they serve as a remainder of why Smith is universally regarded as the premier American microbiologist of his day.\r"

Resistance to older antibacterial agents appears to have stabilized overall, but shifts of resistance genes into new strains and species have continued to cause new clinical problems. Resistance to newer antibacterial agents has increased. Resistance is more prevalent in developing countries. Systematic surveillance of resistance integrated with understanding of its molecular basis is needed for control of resistance.\r"

The task force recognized the impact of respiratory and diarrheal diseases on morbidity and mortality among young children in developing nations. Another major concern was the potential for global spread of resistant strains. Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is augmented in settings in which treatment may be inadequate because of socioeconomic constraints and where there is crowding and poor sanitation. Much of the information concerning the factors that govern antibiotic use in these countries is anecdotal. No two countries are identical in their use of antimicrobial agents, and patterns of use may differ greatly in regions within the same country. Efforts to improve the usage of antibiotics in developing countries must take into consideration the perception of health and disease of the populations, the availability of antibiotics, and the characteristics of the established systems of medical care.\r"

A growing literature describes how prescribers and patients acquire the information that influences them in their utilization of these agents. The quality and content of this information ultimately determine whether a given microorganism will ever meet a particular drug. Most evidence indicates that there is considerable room for improvement in such decision making. Research data, including those from randomized controlled trials, have been used to compare the efficacy of several methods of improving the flow of information about proper antibiotic use. While traditional passive forms of education are not powerful means of changing prescribing behavior, innovative approaches, including person-to-person tutorials, can improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing. Benefit-cost analysis documents that these programs can save more than they cost. Additional research on these questions will be a powerful way of maximizing both effectiveness and efficiency in the treatment of infectious diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The economic consequences of antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy for bacterial infections in humans are profound. The reduction in real-dollar terms in the amount of illness and disability resulting from the use of developed and marketed antibiotics far outweighs costs of adverse effects, including resistance. Although bacterial infections continue to cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, standard criteria for assessing the relation of infection to death or the contribution of resistance to mortality and morbidity do not exist. While local outbreaks of resistance may have serious consequences, bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial therapy has remained virtually unchanged nationally where studied. Nevertheless, discriminating use of antimicrobial agents is held widely to be the keystone for minimizing resistance. It is not clear whether risk of selecting resistance is lowered by current community or clinical practices. Some analysts concentrate on the \"problem\" and \"cost\" of resistance and forget the benefits of the use of antibiotics. Development of resistance is a natural consequence of antibiotic use, but further quantification of this relation is required. Reports that resistance is increasing worldwide have presented a scientific challenge and economic opportunity to the pharmaceutical industry for the development of new antimicrobial agents. However, if a reasonable rate of return cannot be foreseen, capital for research and development is likely to be invested in areas that appear more financially attractive.\r"

A cross was made between two clones of Plasmodium falciparum differing in enzymes, drug sensitivity, antigens, and chromosome patterns. Parasites showing recombination between the parent clone markers were detected at a high frequency. Novel forms of certain chromosomes, detected by pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis, were produced readily, showing that extensive rearrangements occur in the parasite genome after cross-fertilization. Since patients are frequently infected with mixtures of genetically distinct parasites, mosquito transmission is likely to provide the principal mechanisms for generating parasites with novel genotypes.\r"

To evaluate whether antiviral drugs could cross the placental barrier and influence the course of the disease, the drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) was administered to infected embryos through the drinking water of pregnant females. AZT treatment markedly retarded the onset and course of virus-induced central nervous system disease, permitting animals to survive beyond 4 months of age. These results are evidence for effective antiviral treatment during gestation and in the perinatal period and are of potential significance for the management of maternal transmission of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus.\r"

Antibodies to the major rat liver gap junction protein (27,000 daltons) recognize a gap junction antigen in hydra and are effective in eliminating junctional communication between hydra cells. The antibodies perturb the head inhibition gradient in grafting operations, suggesting that cell-cell communication via gap junctions is important in this defined tissue patterning process.\r"

A further five- to tenfold increase in its expression under influence of the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine leukemia virus was associated with activation of erbB-2 as a potent oncogene. The high levels of the erbB-2 product associated with malignant transformation of NIH/3T3 cells were observed in human mammary tumor cells that overexpressed this gene. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism for acquisition of oncogenic properties by genes encoding growth factor receptor-like proteins and provide a functional basis for the role of their overexpression in the development of human malignancies.\r"

The nrdB intron was shown to be absent from the genomes of the closely related T-even phages T2 and T6. Evidence for variable intron distribution was provided by autocatalytic 32P-guanosine 5'-triphosphate labeling of T-even RNAs, DNA and RNA hybridization analyses, and DNA sequencing studies. The results indicate the nonessential nature of the intron in nrdB expression and phage viability. Furthermore, they suggest that either precise intron loss from T2 and T6 or lateral intron acquisition by T4 occurred since the evolution of these phages from a common ancestor. Intron movement in the course of T-even phage divergence raises provocative questions about the origin of these self-splicing elements in prokaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin is a gonadal glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary gland and exhibits intragonadal actions as well. The present study shows that inhibin-like immunoreactivity (inhibin-LI) is present in cells of the cytotrophoblast layer of human placenta at term and in primary cultures of human trophoblasts. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulated secretion of inhibin-LI from these cultured placental cells. This effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP), forskolin, and cholera toxin, suggesting that the mechanism of hCG induction of placental inhibin-LI secretion is cAMP-dependent. Incubation with an antiserum that binds the alpha-subunit of human inhibin increased the secretion of hCG and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-like immunoreactivity (GnRH-LI) from trophoblast cells in culture, suggesting a local tonic inhibitory action of endogenous inhibin on hCG and GnRH-LI release. The action of inhibin on hCG secretion may partially require the presence of placental GnRH, as suggested by evidence that a synthetic GnRH antagonist partially reverses the hCG increase induced by inhibin immunoneutralization. Results suggest paracrine roles for both inhibin and GnRH in the regulation of placental hCG production.\r"

  ".W": "A polygenic basis for susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice has been established by outcross to a related inbred strain, nonobese normal (NON). Analysis of first and second backcross progeny has shown that at least three recessive genes are required for development of overt diabetes. One, Idd-1s, is tightly linked to the H-2K locus on chromosome 17; another, Idd-2s, is localized proximal to the Thy-1/Alp-1 cluster on chromosome 9. Segregation of a third, Idd-3s, could be shown in a second backcross. Neither Idd-1s nor Idd-2s could individually be identified as the locus controlling insulitis; leukocytic infiltrates in pancreas were common in most asymptomatic BC1 mice. Both F1 and BC1 mice exhibited the unusually high percentage of splenic T lymphocytes characteristic of NOD, suggesting dominant inheritance of this trait. The polygenic control of diabetogenesis in NOD mice, in which a recessive gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex is but one of several controlling loci, suggests that similar polygenic interactions underlie this type of diabetes in humans.\r"

  ".W": "A novel approach to engineering enzyme specificity is presented in which a catalytic group from an enzyme is first removed by site-directed mutagenesis causing inactivation. Activity is then partially restored by substrates containing the missing catalytic functional group. Replacement of the catalytic His with Ala in the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene (the mutant is designated His64Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis reduces the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by a factor of a million when assayed with N-succinyl-L-Phe-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide (sFAAF-pNA). Model building studies showed that a His side chain at the P2 position of a substrate bound at the active site of subtilisin could be virtually superimposed on the catalytic His side chain of this serine protease. Accordingly, the His64Ala mutant hydrolyzes a His P2 substrate (sFAHF-pNA) up to 400 times faster than a homologous Ala P2 or Gln P2 substrate (sFAAF-pNA or sFAQF-pNA) at pH 8.0. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme hydrolyzes these three substrates with similar catalytic efficiencies. Additional data from substrate-dependent pH profiles and hydrolysis of large polypeptides indicate that the His64Ala mutant enzyme can recover partially the function of the lost catalytic histidine from a His P2 side chain on the substrate. Such \"substrate-assisted catalysis\" provides a new basis for engineering enzymes with very narrow and potentially useful substrate specificities. These studies also suggest a possible functional intermediate in the evolution of the catalytic triad of serine proteases.\r"

These proteins of 44 and 37 kilodaltons are converted to 25.5 kilodaltons by enzymatic deglycosylation. Although adipsin is principally synthesized in adipose tissue, it is also produced by sciatic nerve and is found in the bloodstream. Because of the apparent restriction of adipsin synthesis to tissues highly active in lipid metabolism, its presence in serum, and its modulation in altered metabolic states, this molecule may play a previously unrecognized role in systemic lipid metabolism or energy balance.\r"

  ".W": "Adipsin, a serine protease homolog, is synthesized and secreted by adipose cells and is found in the bloodstream. The expression of adipsin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was analyzed in rodents during metabolic perturbations and in several experimental models of obesity. Adipsin mRNA abundance is increased in adipose tissue during fasting in normal rats and in diabetes due to streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency. Adipsin mRNA abundance decreased during the continuous infusion of glucose, which induces a hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic state that is accompanied by an increased adipose mass; it is suppressed (greater than 100-fold) in two strains of genetically obese mice (db/db and ob/ob), compared to their congenic counterparts, and is also reduced when obesity is induced chemically by injection of monosodium glutamate into newborn mice. Circulating adipsin protein is decreased in these animal models of obesity, as determined by immunoblotting with antisera to adipsin. Little change in adipsin expression is observed in a model of obesity obtained by pure overfeeding of normal rats (cafeteria model). These data suggest a possible role for adipsin in the above-mentioned disordered metabolic states, and raise the possibility that adipsin expression may be used to distinguish obesities that arise from certain genetic or metabolic defects from those that result from pure overfeeding.\r"

This clone encodes a 60-kilodalton protein that differs from chicken or human pp60c-src primarily in having six extra amino acids (Arg-Lys-Val-Asp-Val-Arg) within the NH2-terminal 16 kilodaltons of the molecule. S1 nuclease protection analysis confirmed that brain c-src RNA contains an 18-nucleotide insertion at the position of the extra six amino acids. This insertion occurs at a position that corresponds to a splice junction in the chicken and human c-src genes. The isolated c-src cDNA clone encodes a protein that displays an identical V8 peptide pattern to that observed in pp60c-src isolated from tissues of neuronal origin.\r"

Recently, a novel gene named erg, closely related to the v-ets oncogene, was identified in human COLO 320 cells and the nucleotide sequence of its approximately 5.0-kilobase transcript, erg 1 was determined. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the alternatively spliced transcript, erg 2, was found to differ from erg 1 by a splicing event that causes a coding frameshift near the amino terminus, resulting in an additional 99-amino acid insertion at the amino-terminus. Expression of complementary DNAs for the two transcripts in vitro resulted in synthesis of polypeptides of approximately 41 and 52 kilodaltons, suggesting the use of alternative translation initiation codons in the case of erg proteins. The erg gene was localized by somatic cell genetic analysis to human chromosome 21. It is proposed that alternative sites of splicing and polyadenylation, together with alternative sites of translation initiation, allow the synthesis of two related polypeptides from a single erg gene transcriptional unit.\r"

However, it is not known whether any level of naturally acquired antibodies to the circumsporozoite protein can predict resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In this study, 83 adults in a malaria-endemic region of Kenya were tested for circumsporozoite antibodies and then treated for malaria. They were monitored for the development of new malaria infections for 98 days. Antibody levels, as determined by four assays in vitro, were indistinguishable between the 60 individuals who did and the 23 who did not develop parasitemia during follow-up, and there was no apparent relation between day of onset of parasitemia and level of antibodies to circumsporozoite protein. Unless immunization with sporozoite vaccines induces antibodies that are quantitatively or qualitatively superior to the circumsporozoite antibodies in these adults, it is unlikely that such antibodies will prevent infection in areas with as intense malaria transmission as western Kenya.\r"

Thus, gastric devascularization was performed upon miniature swine and the gastric mucosal blood flow was serially measured in order to attempt to explain its efficacy. Total gastric mucosal blood flow decreased immediately, a maximum 36 per cent at 60 minutes. At three hours, gastric mucosal blood flow, although still significantly lowered (11 per cent), had begun a recovery that was total at one week. These results suggest that the efficacy of devascularization lies in its ability to modulate decreased gastric mucosal blood flow and, thereby, stop hemorrhage from established lesions. The rapid rebound of gastric mucosal blood flow to near normal levels prevents extension of the erosive process. These factors form the physiologic basis for the efficacy of gastric devascularization.\r"

During a period of 12 years, a total of 29 patients were operated on by this technique, among them 12 children. In the adult, the procedure was carried out with the patient awake and sitting upright; the pediatric patients required general anesthesia and the head was supported either manually or by a clamp. Representative specimens were obtained in all cases but one, showing a wide diagnostic spectrum. As a rule, the procedures were performed smoothly, with no serious side effects. Stereotactic biopsies in the posterior fossa, hitherto seldom performed, open new diagnostic perspectives, one of which is for use in obscure brain stem lesions. The transcerebellar approach has been proven to be easy, direct, and safe provided an appropriate technique is used, such as that described in the present paper.\r"

Accurate localization of the intracerebral mass lesion was obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans, but CT-guided stereotactic aspiration was required for diagnosis and treatment in every case. After Nocardia asteroides was seen on Gram's stain and subsequently identified by culture, appropriate antibiotic therapy was initiated. Both heart transplant patients survived in good neurological condition. We believe that stereotactic aspiration followed by prolonged antibiotic therapy may significantly improve the outcome of patients with nocardial brain abscess.\r"

AMD is an advanced stage of a deteriorative process that takes place in all eyes. The primary lesion in AMD appears to reside in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), possibly resulting from its high rate of molecular degradation. Beginning early in life, and continuing throughout the life span, cells of the RPE gradually accumulate sacs of molecular debris. These residual bodies (lipofuscin) are remnants of the incomplete degradation of abnormal molecules which have been damaged within the RPE cells or derived from phagocytized rod and cone membranes. Progressive engorgement of RPE cells with these functionless residues is associated with the extrusion of aberrant materials which accumulate in Bruch's membrane and aggregate in the form of drusen and basal laminar deposits. These excretions contribute to the further deterioration of the RPE. Loss of vision results from death of visual cells due to degeneration of RPE cells, or the effects of leakage from neovascular membranes that invade the region of abnormal extracellular deposits.\r"

Sections on pharmacology and design of clinical trials are included to aid the ophthalmologist in evaluating the new drugs and published clinical reports. The major questions to consider in evaluating the therapeutic potential of a new beta-blocker for the treatment of glaucoma involve efficacy and safety: Is the drug as effective as timolol?

The regulation of blood flow was very rapid; only 2.3 seconds elapsed from application of the light stimulus to 50% of full response. Full regulation (90% of full response) took 4.6 seconds. The blood flow response adapted slightly after about 10 seconds. Flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery increased significantly, by 3.3%, while flow in the superior cerebellar artery showed no significant change in response to this stimulus. These findings suggest the mechanism of very fast metabolic regulation of cerebral blood flow in humans.\r"

To define the optimal dose of Pentastarch, 12 subjects donated granulocytes by continuous-flow, centrifugation leukapheresis on three occasions at 3-week intervals. Each subject received approximately 250,500, or 1000 ml of Pentastarch according to a random sequence during procedures in which 81 of donor blood was consistently processed. Plasma Pentastarch concentrations (mean mg/ml) measured immediately after leukapheresis were 3.1, 6.7, and 12.7 for the 250, 500-, and 1000-ml doses, respectively. Total leukocyte and neutrophil yields with the 500- or the 1000-ml doses of Pentastarch were similar, and both were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than those with the 250-ml dose. Neutrophil yields per concentrate (mean X 10(-10) were 0.74, 1.72, and 1.73 for the 250-, 500-, and 1000-ml doses, respectively. Pentastarch dose had little effect on lymphocyte and platelet yields. No serious adverse effects were evident for any dose of Pentastarch during 12 weeks of observation. In particular, the 1000-ml dose did not produce increased toxicity. Thus, a single 500-ml bottle of 10 percent Pentastarch produced maximal yields; efficacy was not improved by doubling the dose.\r"

Some deterioration in retinopathy was found in 2/18 patients in the CIT group, in 5/13 in the CSII group, and in 3/9 of those who declined the pump treatment. The proportion of patients whose retinopathy progressed did not differ significantly between the groups, and in the majority the deterioration was mild. However, two patients in the CSII group developed acute ischaemic retinopathy, which progressed to proliferative stage in spite of laser treatment. In these two cases the decrease in the Hb AIc level was among the greatest and fastest in the study. These data suggest that a rapid near normalization of glycaemic control by CSII during pregnancy can accelerate the progress of retinopathy in poorly controlled diabetic patients.\r"

Home blood glucose levels were lower during CSII (8.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, mean +/- SEM) than during CIT (9.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, p less than 0.05). During the first six months, HbA1 fell on CSII therapy (from 10.6 +/- 0.4 to 9.7 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.001), whereas no change occurred during CIT. After the crossover, HbA1 decreased again on CSII (p less than 0.05), but rose in patients shifted from CSII to CIT (p less than 0.05). The fall in glycosylated haemoglobin during CSII correlated with the initial HbA1 level (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001). Ketoacidosis was more common during CSII (16 vs. 2 verified episodes). Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently, without difference between CSII and CIT. Fifty-six per cent of the patients preferred CSII after the study. In conclusion, while CSII slightly improves the metabolic control, the improvement in the unselected study population is less than previously reported among highly selected patients.\r"

The number of exacerbations were significantly lower than during the previous winter in both groups: 0.6 compared to 3.8 in the trimethoprim group, and 0.6 to 3.0 in the placebo group. Tolerance of trimethoprim was good and did not differ from that of placebo. The necessity of double-blind trials in evaluating the prophylactic value of antibiotics in COPD is emphasized, since the exacerbations are also dependent on many unknown factors. There were no statistically significant differences in blood counts of folate levels.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic transplantation was performed in 46 patients over a 2-year period at the University of Minnesota. Thirty-six of these patients subsequently underwent 166 sonographic examinations of the upper abdomen. Forty-three examinations were performed within 2 weeks of transplantation, 47 between 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation, and 76 more than 8 weeks after transplantation. The sonograms were reviewed retrospectively and correlated with the available clinical and histopathologic data. Diffuse, nonspecific parenchymal abnormalities were seen in 27 patients. Focal regions of parenchymal abnormality seen in four patients were associated with abscess and infarction. Moderate to severe biliary dilatation was seen in seven patients with biliary obstruction diagnosed by percutaneous or T-tube cholangiography. Obstruction was seen most commonly in children who had undergone cholecystojejunostomy biliary reconstruction, and it required radiologic or surgical intervention. Routine sonographic assessment of the upper abdominal vasculature showed thrombosis of the portal vein in two cases, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava in one case, thrombosis of the donor aorta in three cases. Focal intraabdominal fluid collections were identified in 14 patients and represented hematomas in all but one. Free peritoneal fluid was detected in 19 patients. Sonography was used to guide percutaneous aspiration of abdominal fluid and to guide fine-needle puncture for percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Upper abdominal sonography provides a noninvasive means of evaluating and confirming a wide spectrum of complications that can follow hepatic transplantation. Because clinical and laboratory findings often are nonspecific in these patients, sonographic detection of focal parenchymal abnormalities, biliary dilatation, and vascular compromise is especially valuable.\r"
