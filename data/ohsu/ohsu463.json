  ".W": "Persistent inability to tolerate discontinuation from mechanical ventilation is frequently encountered in patients recovering from acute respiratory failure. We studied the ability of inspiratory pressure support, a new mode of ventilatory assistance, to promote a nonfatiguing respiratory muscle activity in eight patients unsuccessful at weaning from mechanical ventilation. During spontaneous breathing, seven of the eight patients demonstrated electromyographic signs of incipient diaphragmatic fatigue. During ventilation with pressure support at increasing levels, the work of breathing gradually decreased (p less than 0.02) as well as the oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles (p less than 0.01), and electrical signs suggestive of diaphragmatic fatigue were no longer present. In addition, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure was progressively reduced. For each patient an optimal level of pressure support was found (as much as 20 cm H2O), identified as the lowest level maintaining diaphragmatic activity without fatigue. Above this level, diaphragmatic activity was further reduced and untoward effects such as hyperinflation and apnea occurred. When electrical diaphragmatic fatigue occurred, the activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was markedly increased, whereas it was minimal when the optimal level was reached. We conclude that in patients demonstrating difficulties in weaning from the ventilator: (1) pressure support ventilation can assist spontaneous breathing and avoid diaphragmatic fatigue (pressure support allows adjustment of the work of each breath to provide an optimal muscle load); (2) clinical monitoring of sternocleidomastoid muscle activity allows the required level of pressure support to be determined to prevent fatigue.\r"

Three patients required operative intervention for management of complications of their disease. This review discusses the presentation, diagnosis, and operative management of GITB. The authors feel that the increasing prevalence of GITB noted in their institution is primarily the result of the growing prevalence of mycobacterium tuberculosis pneumonia across the nation. With the recent influx of patients from areas of endemic tuberculosis and the increasing number of immunosuppressed patients, a surge in the number of patients presenting with GITB is likely to occur in the United States. Surgeons must be conversant with the diverse clinical features and operative management of this disease.\r"

It is considered to have a 95 per cent sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis. Occasionally, a small contracted gallbladder associated with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize with ultrasonography. Two patients with agenesis of the gallbladder were recently treated by the authors. Each patient had ultrasonographic evidence suggestive of a contracted gallbladder with stones. Both patients were explored and found to have absent gallbladders and normal operative cholangiograms. Agenesis of the gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly with a reported incidence of from 0.01 to 0.04 per cent. Approximately 220 cases have been reported in the literature. Most of these are from necropsy studies. Many of these were newborns with more serious anomalies. One might project an increase in adult cases on the basis of increased usage of ultrasonography in patients with abdominal problems. At the present time, only operative findings including cholangiography can be considered as diagnostic of gallbladder agenesis. However, as more of these cases are reported, preoperative awareness of this entity will be increased.\r"

Treatment modalities gradually evolved from primarily operative decompression in the first 20 years to selective, sigmoidoscopic, nonoperative reduction in the most recent 10-year period. Operative reduction was associated with a 10 per cent mortality, while no deaths were associated with nonoperative reduction. A 60 per cent mortality was noted when gangrenous bowel was present. In the most recent 10-year period, 71 per cent of cases were associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, and one third had a previous episode of sigmoid volvulus. The diagnosis was made on the initial plain abdominal radiograph in 60 per cent, and nonoperative sigmoidoscopic reduction attained in 95 per cent. Following nonoperative reduction, elective resection was performed during the same hospitalization with a 5 per cent mortality. Initial management of sigmoid volvulus should consist of nonoperative attempts at reduction with operative reduction reserved for refractory cases or those with ischemic bowel. Elective resection can be safely performed during the same hospitalization.\r"

Twenty-eight consecutive patients with benign strictures treated between 1972 and 1987 are reviewed in this report. Stricture etiology was iatrogenic in 13 patients, pancreatitic in 11, idiopathic in three, and traumatic in one. The authors performed 27 operations and three percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatations in the treatment of these patients. Operative morbidity was 18 per cent; there were no operative deaths. Treatment was successful in 23 of 28 patients with a mean followup of four years, and four of the five patients with initially unsuccessful results have undergone successful remedial operations. Roux-en-Y biliary enteric diversion procedures have been most successful in these patients: seven patients with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy without recurrence (mean followup of 62 months) and eight patients with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy with a success rate of 87.5 per cent (mean followup of 50 months). Two patients underwent three percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatations; one has had a good result with short followup and the other failed on two occasions and has required a remedial operation. Benign biliary strictures have multiple etiologies. Therapeutic approaches, which now include nonoperative procedures, must be tailored to the needs of individual patients. The potential for recurrence is always present. Longterm followup remains essential in the management of patients with this disorder.\r"

DESIGN: Plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained following a single 80 mg/m2 body surface dose infused over 1 hour (n = 9), and during a continuous infusion of 0.5 (n = 3), 0.9 (n = 8), 1.4 (n = 7), or 1.8 (n = 3) mg/kg body weight per hour. SETTING: Outpatient clinic and inpatient ward of the Pediatric Branch of the National Cancer Institute. PATIENTS: Twenty-one children (seventeen boys) ranging in age from 14 months to 12 years with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection who were being treated on a phase I-II study of continuous intravenous infusion zidovudine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Zidovudine disappearance following bolus administration was rapid and biexponential with half-lives of 9.6 and 92 minutes, and a total clearance of 705 +/- 330 mL/min.m2. Zidovudine remained above 1 mumol/L, the optimal virostatic concentration in vitro, for only 1.5 hours. In contrast, with continuous infusion steady-state plasma zidovudine concentrations (Css) were maintained above 1 mumol/L continuously, even at the lowest infusion rate. At steady state the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid zidovudine concentration to plasma was 24% +/- 9%. Patients who developed severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/L) on the continuous infusion regimen had significantly higher plasma Css. Six of eight had a Css greater than 3.0 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic parameters show that continuous infusion is better than an intermittent schedule in maintaining minimal virostatic concentrations of the drug with a lower daily dose.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported from 1983 to July 1988 were identified by computer searches of MEDLINE and TOXLINE, and review of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: Of 57 articles originally identified, 39 were selected by two readers. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality and significance were independently assessed by each reader. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of praziquantel have been well documented. Yet, despite extensive in vivo and in vitro laboratory studies, the drug's mechanism of action in killing parasites is unknown. Although the efficacy of praziquantel was first established for treating schistosomiasis, in the last 5 years its clinical use has been expanded to the treatment of intestinal, tissue, and lung flukes, and intestinal and tissue cestode infections, including neurocysticercosis. The introduction of praziquantel was a significant advance in antihelminthic therapy, in that it was effective therapy for several parasites that had been previously considered untreatable. Availability of a safe, effective broad-spectrum oral antihelminthic agent consolidated the central role of chemotherapy in population-based control of many trematode and cestode parasites. Randomized trials have shown, however, that older, cheaper agents may be more cost-effective in controlling Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in some endemic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although praziquantel is the treatment of choice for most human trematode and cestode infections, cost factors have limited its use in developing countries.\r"

In addition to their effects on hematopoiesis, some colony-stimulating factors prime mature cells for enhanced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing in response to physiologic stimuli. The action of colony-stimulating factors is mediated by growth factor receptors on precursor and mature effector cells. The results of studies of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) suggest a possible therapeutic role for colony-stimulating factors in augmenting mechanism of host defense.\r"

DESIGN: Information synthesis based on historical review of developments in the understanding of the pathophysiology of allergic diseases and on selected recent literature on efficacy of specific diagnostic tests. MAIN RESULTS: Skin testing is most effective when based on clues from the patient's history. The sensitivity and specificity of skin testing methods are compared: skin prick testing alone is often sufficient to identify or exclude immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity, including food allergy. Except for penicillin and certain macromolecules, skin testing is not useful for evaluating drug allergy. Skin test titration may be useful for determining the starting dose for immunotherapy; otherwise it is rarely necessary. The patch skin test helps identify the cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Bronchial provocation testing is useful in special cases. Oral provocation testing may be used to identify allergy or other intolerance to suspected foods, food additives, and certain drugs. Provocation testing is time-consuming and requires special precautions. In-vitro methods for identifying allergen-specific IgE are especially useful when skin testing is unreliable, equivocal, or cannot be done. In-vitro tests should be used as adjuncts to the clinical interview and examination. CONCLUSIONS: Tests that are effective for identifying allergenic substances usually can be determined from a careful patient interview. Clinicians should be aware of nonspecific test results and allergy tests of unproven effectiveness.\r"

Degenerative changes consisted of cytoplasmic vacuolation and fenestration, abundant satellite cells, neurofilament accumulation in neurons, and axonal dystrophy with spheroid formation and torpedolike structures arising from the neuronal cytoplasm. Dystrophic axons, axonal spheroids, and some ganglion cells were labeled with monoclonal antibodies to a phosphorylated epitope of neurofilaments (200 kDa). Polyclonal antibodies to purified scrapie-associated fibril/prion protein (molecular weight 27-30 kDa) extracted from scrapie-infected hamster brains, as well as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to a synthetic 15-amino acid polypeptide of the 27- to 30-kDa protein, demonstrated variable immunoreactivity with degenerating neurons in the CJD cases, but not in the controls. Furthermore, some of the satellite cells and dystrophic axons were stained by the antibodies to the synthetic peptide. These data indicate that the first-order neurons of the trigeminal ganglia may form a route by which the CJD agent may travel from the brain to the periphery or vice versa. As in other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, disturbances of neuroaxonal transport seem to occur in CJD.\r"

The CSF samples from 48 patients were reactive, and the medical history and results of the CSF-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (CSF-VDRL) for syphilis for 38 of these patients were reviewed. Likely active neurosyphilis was diagnosed if the patient had a reactive CSF-FTA-ABS test, recent onset of neurological signs consistent with neurosyphilis, abnormal CSF, and no other recognized cause for the neurological illness. Fifteen patients were so classified. Four had a reactive CSF-VDRL test. The specificity of the CSF-VDRL in diagnosing likely active neurosyphilis was 100%, but the sensitivity was only 27%. The insensitivity of the CSF-VDRL test limits its usefulness as a screening test for neurosyphilis. The CSF-FTA-ABS test appears more sensitive for screening but is less specific than the CSF-VDRL test in distinguishing currently active neurosyphilis from past syphilis. These findings imply that clinical judgment is still essential in establishing the diagnosis of active neurosyphilis.\r"

Currently there is wide variation in assessment methods used, and even well-designed clinical assessment techniques have a wide observer error: objective assessment methods may have advantages. The clinical assessment techniques used in 30 clinical trials of treatment in chronic plaque psoriasis in 1985 and 1986 were reviewed and a detailed analysis is presented. In only 18 trials were individual regions assessed, and widely differing methods of scoring signs were used. Reproducibility of the assessment by clinicians of area of skin involvement by psoriasis was studied. Ten patients with chronic plaque psoriasis had standardized photography, and four clinicians assessed area of involvement from the photographs. The clinicians significantly differed in their rank ordering of the area of psoriatic skin involvement. Area of involvement by psoriasis in the same photographs was assessed objectively using computer-assisted planimetry. Although the clinicians' assessment did not differ randomly from the objective measurement, the accuracy of subjective area assessment is not the same for all clinicians. As even experienced clinical observers show wide variation when attempting to record clinical severity of psoriasis, there is clearly a need for better objective measures of psoriasis severity.\r"

Acquired progressive kinking of the hair is an acquired disorder of hair formation in which patches of hair become tightly curled and resemble pubic hair. It seems to be more common in males and is associated with darkening of the involved hair in about two thirds of the patients. The differential diagnosis includes inherited forms of kinky hair and kinky hair secondary to mechanical, chemical, or traumatic manipulation. Drugs are infrequently implicated in its causation.\r"

  ".W": "Symptomatic vulvar burning (vulvodynia) in the absence of abnormal physical findings was long thought to be an unusual psychosomatic gynecologic problem. Within the past decade, however, a number of investigators began to study patients with this frustrating problem. Initial physician insistence on a major role for psychological factors has gradually given way to sophisticated searches for evidence of persistent infectious agents, especially human papillomavirus and Candida. Gynecologists searching for causes and surgical relief of vulvodynia have even reevaluated elements of vulvar anatomy. The purpose of this article is to introduce dermatologists to current perspectives on vulvodynia in the context of the clinical experience of the author, who has been actively involved in the multidisciplinary investigation of this problem since its recognition in the early 1980s. To date, the following five sign-symptom complexes have been identified by the author and recognized by other vulvodynia investigators: (1) vulvar dermatoses, (2) cyclic vulvitis, (3) vulvar papillomatosis, (4) vulvar vestibulitis, and (5) essential vulvodynia. A given patient's complaint may be primarily associated with one of these factors, but it is not unusual to see others develop simultaneously or sequentially. Remission or exacerbation of symptoms may occur when treatment for one condition affects the onset of another. It is evident that vulvodynia is a complex diagnosis and that recognition of multiple factors is important to appropriate patient evaluation and management.\r"

The immunologic processes that conspire to produce this damaging tissue reaction are derived from the normal immunologic balance between a protection of self and a destruction of nonself. Experimental work in the last decade has focused on the role of antigen-presenting cells, and specifically Langerhans' cells, in its initiation, as well as on the competing roles of subsets of T lymphocytes in its regulation. For humans, an important goal has been the development of techniques by which tolerization and desensitization may be achieved, and for those who work with laboratory animals, contact hypersensitivity has provided methods to examine immunoregulation in general. In the coming decade, new techniques from molecular biology, molecular genetics, tissue culture, and, above all, shrewd clinical observation will provide a new array of ideas and possibilities.\r"

Eleven patients, three from the medium-dose and eight from the high-dose conditions, dropped out owing to side effects. No instructions or encouragement for self-directed exposure to phobic situations or other coping strategies with panic or fear were given throughout the trial. Compliance, as assessed by pill counts and by plasma tricyclic levels, was high. Results provided strong evidence for a positive dose-response relationship on panic and phobic symptoms and confirmed earlier suggestions (1) that imipramine without concurrent exposure possesses a significant antipanic and antiphobic effect, (2) that improvement correlates primarily with imipramine but not N-desmethylimipramine plasma levels, and (3) that side effects prevent optimum dose buildup in a substantial proportion of patients with this disorder.\r"

In the first study, intravenous clonidine (2 micrograms/kg) and placebo were administered on a blind basis to 12 patients with panic disorder and ten normal controls. Clonidine produced significantly greater decrements in anxiety at one hour in the patients with panic disorder than in the controls. The changes in pulse, blood pressure, and ratings of sleepiness did not differ significantly between patients and controls. In the second study, oral clonidine was administered to 18 patients in a double-blind, flexible-dose treatment trial averaging ten weeks in duration. While anxiolytic effects were noticed in some patients, these effects did not persist in the group as a whole. These two studies indicate that while clonidine has short-term anxiolytic effects in patients with panic disorder, these effects do not persist with long-term administration in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "The standard of care for acute thromboembolic stroke is changing rapidly with the advent of new pharmacologic therapies. The deterioration of focal cerebral ischemia to infarction can be lessened with timely restoration of cerebral blood flow. As pharmacologic therapy of acute stroke evolves, emergency physicians will increasingly facilitate its implementation. The purpose of this study was to elucidate those factors significantly affecting the acute stroke patient's emergency department (ED) evaluation time. The pretreatment ED evaluations of 20 patients entered in an ongoing trial of a fibrinolytic agent (ancrod) for acute ischemic stroke were reviewed. Pretreatment screening factors included the assessment of hematologic status, concurrent illness, and potential neoplastic disease or cerebral hemorrhage as the etiology for the neurological deficit. The following factors had a statistically significant effect on pretreatment evaluation time (range, 2.6 to 11.4 hours) by multiple linear regression analysis: time from arrival until bleeding time completed (P less than .005), time from arrangement of computed head tomography until its completion (P less than .05), chosen site of treatment (ED v neurological step-down unit; P less than .005), order of patient entry (P less than .01), and time from arrival until completion of fibrinogen level assay (P less than .05). These results emphasize the need to coordinate and streamline the clinical evaluation process. The use of the ED as the site of treatment, abbreviating the time until pharmacologic therapy, has not been previously documented. Expedient completion of an evaluation compatible with safe pharmacologic therapy of acute ischemic stroke will dictate the time of definitive therapy. These results should assist other institutions considering rapid pharmacologic therapy for acute ischemic stroke.\r"

Encouragement of deep breathing is also recommended to avoid secondary or delayed pulmonary complications. The use of circumferential rib belts in treating patients with acute rib fractures has been discouraged because of possible complications from restricted ventilation. A review of the literature revealed no previous clinical studies to support this view. We designed and conducted a controlled, prospective, randomized pilot study to determine if there was any increased morbidity associated with the use of rib belts in the treatment of patients with acute rib fractures. Twenty-five adult patients with radiographically proven acute rib fractures were randomized into two groups. The first group was treated with analgesics and a standard circumferential rib belt (Zimmer Universal Rib Belt). The second group was treated with oral analgesics alone. Patients were contacted by telephone three days after the initial injury and then reexamined 14 days postinjury. Rates of pain resolution, compliance, and delayed complications were determined. Rib belts were not found to significantly reduce the severity of pain. Four complications (one case of bloody pleural effusion requiring hospitalization, two cases of asymptomatic discoid atelectasis, and one case of allergic contact dermatitis) were identified, all occurring in the group of patients receiving rib belts. This pilot study indicates that while rib belts are widely accepted by patients for control of pain, they appear to be associated with an increased incidence of complications. Clinical studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to confirm these findings.\r"

Factor(s) offering \"protection\" from hypertension in these patients remain unknown. Hormonal and hemodynamic parameters involved in blood pressure regulation were evaluated in normotensive, stable sickle cell patients and black nonsickle normotensive controls. There was no difference in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressure between the two groups. The characteristic hemodynamic findings of increased cardiac index, renal plasma flow, and plasma volume were observed in the sickle cell patients. Urinary sodium excretion was comparable on an ad libitum, high sodium, and low sodium diet. In contrast, plasma renin activity was greater in sickle cell patients at all levels of sodium intake in both supine and upright positions. These findings suggested possible altered vascular responsiveness to endogenous angiotensin II. Plethysmography revealed that sickle cell patients had greater forearm blood flow than normal controls and black nonsickle chronic anemic controls at rest, during cold stimulation, and during exercise. Forearm vascular resistance was significantly lower in the patients and did not increase with cold-induced, sympathetic-mediated stimulation. To assess these findings more directly, the pressor response to the exogenous administration of graded doses of angiotensin II and norepinephrine was measured. There was a marked decrease in the pressor response to angiotensin II but not to norepinephrine in the sickle cell patients. The findings in these studies indicate fundamental differences in blood pressure control in the sickle cell patient, probably at the vascular level.\r"

There was a significant rise in PRA in the treatment group when compared to placebo (P less than .05), but the mean blood pressure response was similar in the two groups. When the treatment group was divided according to pretreatment PRA it was, however, seen that subjects with low PRA displayed a reduction in diastolic blood pressure, whereas those with high PRA raised their blood pressure compared to placebo. Also subjects with low pretreatment values for plasma-ionized calcium and high levels of parathyroid hormone showed a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. This study supports the idea of a relationship between calcium metabolism and the renin-aldosterone system in essential hypertension and describes a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure in low-renin hypertension.\r"

They are also useful in the symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement and in decreasing mortality of patients with congestive heart failure.

The emerging differences among the three marketed ACEIs and promising new agents that are expected to be marketed in the next few years are the subject of this review.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of an organ-specific, circulating renal growth factor, renotropin, has been established through various bioassays. However, renotropin may be more than a growth factor. The pathogenesis of essential hypertension is unknown, although a humoral agent related to renal metabolism is believed to be responsible, at least in part. In parallel with the development of a renotropin assay, we have measured vasomotor and natriuretic serum activities. Our data suggest that renotropin possesses vasomotor and natriuretic properties. Through one or both properties, renotropin may play an important role in essential hypertension. This possibility is strengthened by observations that: a) many methods to produce experimental hypertension involve elevations of renotropin--a reduction of renal mass and/or prevention of compensatory growth; b) high renotropin activity has been demonstrated in genetically hypertensive rats (SHR); and c) sera containing high renotropic activity stimulate contraction of isolated rat aortic rings and influence organic anion and cation transport.\r"

As a result of bone grafting, all but two patients had a correction of the enophthalmos to within 1 to 2 mm of the opposite eye. Of the 20 patients with diplopia, 15 had correction, and an additional four had an improvement of diplopia so it occurred in only one field of gaze. Of the 22 patients with grafts to the malar bone, 16 were thought to have good to excellent results; however, six developed some degree of reabsorption at the graft site. No patients had any decrease in vision. The advantages and disadvantages of the surgical procedure are described and compared with other methods.\r"

It has been used extensively for middle ear surgery with little or no adverse effects. A historical review of tissue adhesives and a discussion of technical considerations is outlined. A clinical trial of 100 patients treated with Histoacryl on various surgical wounds revealed no significant adverse effects with wound healing, graft rejection, or infection over a six-month period. Histoacryl appears to offer many advantages and few disadvantages over conventional suture techniques.\r"

Blepharoplasty of the ptotic lid, without repair of the ptosis, may result in exaggeration of the drooping eyelid postoperatively. Acquired senile ptosis is produced by dehiscence or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis and is characterized by a high or absent eyelid crease, thinning of the upper eyelid tissue, and normal levator function. Frequent causes of acquired ptosis include dermatochalasis, eyelid edema from trauma or allergies, previous ocular surgery, or use of contact lenses. When discovered, repair of the ptosis should be performed at the time of blepharoplasty to produce the best functional and cosmetic result. It is important for every surgeon who performs blepharoplasties to be aware of the presentation and management of acquired senile ptosis for consistent surgical results.\r"

After aortic bypass surgery, 77 patients were evaluated and nine stenoses were found; no anastomotic aneurysms were seen. In 105 patients with femoro-distal bypass procedures, occlusion was reported in 11 cases and stenosis in 13 cases. One patient had two anastomotic aneurysms. To summarize, major abnormalities were present in 81 cases (12.7%) and consisted of 59 stenoses of greater than 30%, 17 occlusions and six patients with anastomotic aneurysms. Most of these were unexpected and were reason for more critical follow-up or re-operation.\r"

Providers should be cautious in withholding or withdrawing resuscitative measures from incompetent patients when brain death has not occurred and cardiovascular unresponsiveness has not been demonstrated. However, resuscitation may be withheld when a competent patient refuses it or if there is another medically and legally valid reason to do so.\r"

The traditional techniques for anatomic visualization have been plain-film radiography and myelography, but they have limitations. The development of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have substantially improved anatomic imaging. However, invasive procedures, such as discography, percutaneous nerve-root blocking and percutaneous facet injection, may be helpful in patients with disabling pain in whom noninvasive methods give negative findings, show abnormalities that do not correlate with the symptoms or identify multiple sites of disease. The invasive procedures are believed by some to be associated with too many complications. We have attempted to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of the currently available methods of investigating low back pain and the indications for their use.\r"

All tumors were Stage III with comparable amounts of residual tumor left after the primary resection. Similar postoperative chemotherapeutic regimens were given to each patient, and there was a clinical followup of at least four years in each case. The tumors were classified according to their predominant (greater than 50%) histology as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) (18 tumors), papillary serous (18), undifferentiated (8), or endometrioid (3). There were six mixed carcinomas without predominant histology. In 17 of 18 patients, TCC predominant tumors responded completely to chemotherapy and 15 of 18 patients (83%) are alive without disease 4 to 10 years after presentation (average 6.8 years). In comparison, tumor progression/recurrence developed in 31 of 35 non-TCC tumors (18 serous, eight undifferentiated, one endometrioid predominant, and four mixed carcinomas). Of these 35 patients, 27 (77%) died of disease from 6 months to 7 years after presentation (average 2.5 yrs.). Flow cytometric determination of DNA content and immunoperoxidase studies did not allow discrimination between the histologic types of high-grade ovarian carcinomas. We conclude that TCC should be recognized as a distinct histologic type of ovarian carcinoma because of the favorable response to chemotherapy and improved patient survival.\r"

The immunostaining procedures were applied on frozen tissue sections, tumour imprints, and fine-needle aspirates in order to compare the variations in the distribution of the antigens detected in the three different types of preparations. Positive reactions detected with peroxidase-antiperoxidase and avidinbiotin-peroxidase, and alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase complexes were evaluated through a computerized system of image analysis referred to as SAMBA 200 (SAMBA TITN, Grenoble, France). Application programs specifically developed for the analysis of tissue sections and of cytologic preparations were applied. This system allowed a multiparametric, accurate, reliable, reproducible and automatized evaluation of the heterogeneity of the antigenic sites in tumors. For each markers positive cell surface (PS), and integrated and mean optical densities (IOD, MOD) and IOD histograms were compared. It was shown that (1) there was no significant variation in optical densities in cell imprints and aspirates whereas PS significantly (P less than 0.01) differed in both preparations; (2) there were significant differences of the optical densities between tissue sections and cytological preparations, either imprints or aspirates, likely due to randomly cut nuclei in tissue sections; and (3) there was a significant difference between the PS of tissue sections and aspirates but no significant difference between tissue sections and imprints. It is concluded that fine-needle aspiration constitutes a convenient method for cell sampling, reliable for the diagnosis of malignancies. However, it may not reflect the heterogeneity of cell subpopulations in tissue.\r"

It is suggested that the development of both the ECM and the carcinoids is highly related to the atrophic change of the fundic mucosa and a trophic action of subsequently raised serum gastrin in type A gastritis and that the both lesions arise from the pseudopyloric glands or atrophic fundic glands. In addition, the definition of neoplastic ECM (microcarcinoid) of the stomach was made with comparative study on both the cases with ECM and multiple carcinoids and the cases with ECM alone.\r"

  ".W": "To provide further understanding of humoral hypercalcemia in Hodgkin's disease (HD) the authors describe the clinical features and laboratory investigation of three patients recently treated at Massachusetts General Hospital. All were middle-aged men who presented with symptomatic hypercalcemia which led to a diagnosis of bulky intraabdominal HD. None had evidence of bone involvement or hyperparathyroidism. In the two cases tested 1,25(OH)2D3 was elevated at the time of diagnosis. These characteristics are remarkably similar to those of ten patients with HD and probable humoral hypercalcemia described in the literature. The diagnosis of HD was supported in Cases 1 and 3 by genomic blot analysis which showed no evidence of T-cell or B-cell tumor origin. In an in vitro assay, primary tumor medium from Case 1 stimulated dose-dependent bone resorption which was not entirely ascribable to 1,25(OH)2D3. The authors conclude that humoral hypercalcemia in HD predominantly affects males of middle age, that intraabdominal bulky disease is common, and that hypercalcemia appears to be mediated by tumor related production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in concert with a second factor.\r"

Both were secondary to regional lymph flow obstruction by lymph nodes massively involved by nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Though a temporary remission was achieved by combination chemotherapy, skin lesions were quick to reappear in spite of continued treatment. This was felt to be due to local mechanical factors. A review of the literature reveals two main patterns of Hodgkin's disease of the skin. In one, the disease is either confined to the skin, or is unrelated to existing nodal or visceral involvement. In the other, skin infiltration is secondary to regional lymph node involvement by Hodgkin's disease, as seen in our patient. The pattern of skin involvement by Hodgkin's disease should be taken into consideration in assessing its prognostic significance.\r"

Rhabdomyosarcoma was the fourth most common oral sarcoma (7.5%) from this period after osteosarcoma (32%), fibrosarcoma (19%), and chondrosarcoma (9%). In patients younger than 20 years, RMS was the second most common sarcoma (six cases) after osteosarcoma (ten cases). Combined analysis with 113 further cases documented in the literature showed the majority of cases (71.2%) were embryonal. The alveolar subtype was considered a distant second in frequency (12.3%) even though the pleomorphic subtype was apparently more common (16.4%). However, the pleomorphic cases were diagnosed before histologic criteria were established to discern this entity from other pleomorphic sarcomas and this data is probably unreliable. Site predilections were found for the soft palate, maxillary sinus and alveolus, posterior mandibular region, cheek and lip and possibly tongue. The gingiva and floor of mouth were uncommon sites. There was a predilection for occurrence in the first two decades with a decline in the third decade. Documentation of recent cases treated with a multidisciplinary approach indicated that lesions in the oral soft tissues have a good prognosis; 17 of 21 such cases showed no evidence of disease after a mean follow-up period of 7.2 years (SD = 4.4). In contrast, four of five cases in the posterior mandible resulted in death after a mean period of 1.1 years (SD = 0.3).\r"

It is encouraging to note that although the prevalence of hypertension in women has not changed over the past 20 years, the proportion of treated hypertensive women has increased dramatically and the proportion with controlled blood pressure has doubled since 1960. It is also encouraging to note that the number of adult women who smoke cigarettes has decreased since 1960, but the number of young girls who smoke has increased at an alarming rate. Researchers have noted that the number of cigarettes smoked per day by women has increased from the 1950s to the present. The Framingham data reveal that serum cholesterol level increases substantially with age and that women should take steps to eat a healthy, low-saturated fat, low cholesterol diet to maintain a low blood cholesterol level. The Framingham Study data also show that although the same risk factors operate in men and women, the standard risk factors do not explain the marked differences in morbidity and mortality from heart disease between the two sexes. We must continue to study the epidemiology and biology of coronary heart disease in women both to better understand the disease process in women and to understand the large gender differential for CHD in most Westernized countries.\r"

  ".U": "89119433\r", 
  ".W": "During an acute bout of dynamic exercise, cardiac output increases in direct proportion to the increase in oxygen uptake. The mechanisms by which the cardiac output is increased during exercise may differ between men and women. The increased blood flow is distributed to the exercising skeletal muscle, to the myocardium, and, if exercise lasts longer than 5 minutes, to the skin. Blood flow to tissues whose metabolic rate has not been increased is reduced as a result of a general, sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. During dynamic exercise, muscle blood flow, degree of peripheral vasoconstriction, increase in heart rate, and increase in myocardial blood flow and oxygen uptake are all functions of relative workload, often expressed as a %VO2 max. During an acute bout of resistive exercise, the increase in oxygen uptake and cardiac output is small, at least partially because perfusion of the exercising muscles is difficult as a result of high intramuscular pressures. The heart rate increase is also small. Blood pressure increases markedly as a result of increased total peripheral resistance. Dynamic exercise training results in cardiovascular adaptations both at rest and during exercise. At rest, myocardial hypertrophy of the volume overload type is the most common, but not universal, finding. Dynamic exercise that involves a sizable resistive exercise component may produce changes in myocardial structure and function similar to those resulting from static exercise. The effects of dynamic exercise training on myocardial function at rest need further investigation. The cardiovascular effects of dynamic exercise training are manifest during submaximal exercise by reduced heart rates, blood pressures, and less vasoconstriction in nonexercising tissues; increased stroke volumes; and unchanged cardiac outputs and oxygen uptakes at any given exercise load. During maximal exercise, VO2 max, maximal cardiac output, and maximal stroke volume are all increased. Maximal heart rate and blood pressure at maximal exercise are unchanged. Redistribution of the cardiac output to better perfuse the exercising muscles also occurs. Certain other factors that may modify the cardiovascular response to exercise include phase of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, age, exercise mode, length of the exercise session, and environmental conditions such as heat stress. Although there are some physiologic differences that may affect the mechanism of the changes, the overall response of the cardiovascular system to exercise is similar in men and women.\r"

Diagnostic evaluations should be approached somewhat differently in male and female populations, and gender should be one of the variables assessed when options for medical and surgical therapy are considered. Risk factor modification can be offered as a potentially effective form of therapy for coronary heart disease in women. These modifications would include cessation of smoking, avoidance of oral contraceptives in women greater than 35 years of age, hypertension control, and normalization of blood lipid profile and body weight. Risk factor modification may be particularly important in prevention of accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic women. Prognosis after myocardial infarction is significantly worse in women despite better post-infarction left ventricular ejection fraction and higher incidence of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in that population. Definitive assessment of coronary anatomy and aggressive management of coronary heart disease should be considered in women judged to be at high risk. Little information is available regarding gender-specific responses to medical management of coronary heart disease. Women seem to have a less favorable short-term outcome after PTCA, but better long-term results. Coronary artery bypass grafting results appear to depend less on gender than on coronary anatomy, preoperative risk factors, and patient size, and thus should not be withheld from women.\r"

The sex mortality differential covers all ages and races in most developed nations. The magnitude of the sex mortality differential varies with age, being especially high at younger ages. The most important contributor to the difference in mortality between women and men is the major cause of death in men, i.e., cardiovascular diseases. The universality of the sex mortality differential in various geographical areas, the lower female infant mortality, and the possible hormonal-mediated relative protection of CHD in women all indicate that biological factors contribute to the lower mortality in women than in men. Secular changes in mortality of various diseases over short periods cannot be explained by innate endogenous alterations but instead have to be influenced by behavioral factors and other components of the environment. Longstanding biological differences between women and men might play a role in producing a relatively rapid emergence of sex mortality differential only by interaction with relatively new exogenous environmental factors. The vast majority of studies on the sex differential in mortality trends confirm the importance of smoking as a major contributor to the higher mortality in men than in women. Along this line, other behavioral factors also seem to influence longevity in women. With ongoing changes in society, especially increasing participation of women in the labor force, new components of the environmental setting will have to be assessed by comparable and identical instruments in different populations. Ongoing monitoring of trends in cardiovascular and noncommunicable diseases will provide valuable insight into the sex mortality differential and its determinants. Experimental studies on biological reactivity, sex endocrinology, and atherogenesis are also needed to help explain why women live longer than men.\r"

Although its pathophysiology is unknown and its outcome may be grave to both mother and child, toxemia is preventable, treatable, and curable. This is unlike the three other forms of heart disease occurring in pregnancy discussed here. Aortic dissection, pulmonary hypertension, and peripartum cardiomyopathy are not preventable and are unpredictable, difficult to treat, and incurable. These latter disorders carry on indefinitely for the duration of the patient's life and seriously limit future options, including those for more pregnancies. Among the disorders of the heart in pregnancy, toxemia and peripartum cardiomyopathy are the subjects of especially active investigation at present. Major advances in understanding these disorders could minimize cardiovascular risk to the pregnant woman.\r"

Twenty-one per cent of the patients arrived in the recovery room with hypoxia as measured with a pulse oximeter (SaO2 less than 90 per cent). Fifteen minutes later all patients who arrived hypoxic were well oxygenated on their chosen oxygen therapy. Only one patient that arrived normoxic became hypoxic using a nasal catheter 15 minutes later. There was no statistical difference between patients given 40 per cent O2 by mask versus patients given oxygen by nasal catheter. The mean SaO2 for the group given 40 per cent O2 at 15 minutes was 96.7 +/- 2.15 per cent versus 96.6 +/- 2.48 per cent for nasal catheters. Nasal catheters are as effective as 40 per cent O2 masks for treating hypoxia in the recovery room. Obesity and age were statistically significant risk factors in the patients that arrived hypoxic. Patients were 47.4 +/- 15.6 years in the hypoxic group versus 38.3 +/- 15.6 years in the non-hypoxic group (p less than 0.001). Patients having an endotracheal tube with intermittent positive pressure ventilation or having a premedication were more apt to be hypoxic on arrival. These last two factors were closely associated and may reflect bias. The patient's gender, history of smoking, presence of obstructive lung disease, not including asthma, location of incision, or type of anaesthetic were not statistically significant risk factors.\r"

This relationship was studied after the administration of the full dose of the antagonist in all groups. Edrophonium 1.0 mg.kg-1 was administered either in a single bolus dose (Group I, controls) or in an initial dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.2 mg.kg-1 followed one minute later by the remainder of the 1.0 mg.kg-1 dose in Groups II to V. Reversal was attempted at the ten per cent spontaneous recovery of twitch height (T1) from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Of all the groups studied, Group V had a significantly greater recovery in the TOF ratio at any given T1 value. When first twitch tension (T1) had recovered to 100 per cent of the control, it was found for the same tension that the TOF ratio was greater in Group V, being 0.75 compared to 0.63, 0.65, 0.65 and 0.64 in Groups I to IV respectively. The implication is that this differential ability to reverse fade (or prejunctional activity) may be involved in the acceleration of recovery.\r"

This study was designed to verify whether the same occurred with neostigmine-assisted recovery, and whether this apparent acceleration could explain the previously reported effectiveness of the priming technique for reversal agents. Fourteen adults received atracurium, 0.5 mg.kg-1, during a thiopentone-nitrous oxide-enflurane anaesthetic. The ulnar nerves of both arms were stimulated with train-of-four stimulation every 12 seconds until 1 per cent recovery of first twitch, at which time stimulation in one arm was switched to single twitch. When mean first twitch height reached 10 per cent of control, neostigmine, 0.04 mg.kg-1, was administered either as a single bolus, or as a \"priming\" dose of 0.01 mg.kg-1, followed 3 min later by 0.03 mg.kg-1. No statistically significant differences were observed between single twitch in one arm and first twitch height of the train-of-four in the other arm for the next 10 min.

Partitions chosen by the method of percentile estimation to include 95% of normal subjects remained highly specific in subjects with nonanginal pain syndromes. Sensitivities of the derived partitions for detection of myocardial ischemia were tested in an additional 150 patients with a high likelihood of coronary disease, including 100 patients with angiographically demonstrated coronary obstruction and 50 patients with stable angina. In contrast to the 68% (102 of 150 subjects) sensitivity of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of disease in this population, the sensitivity of an ST segment/heart rate slope partition of 2.4 muV/beats/min was 95% (142 of 150 subjects, p less than 0.001), and the sensitivity of a delta ST segment/heart rate index partition of 1.6 muV/beats/min was 91% (137 of 150 subjects, p less than 0.001). Analysis of receiver-operating curves confirmed the superior performance of the heart rate-adjusted indexes throughout a wide range of test specificities. These findings suggest that heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression can markedly improve the clinical usefulness of the treadmill exercise electrocardiogram.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity or beta-receptor density or both has been described in several animal species after denervating the heart. The transplanted human heart is also denervated and, therefore, may exhibit supersensitivity to beta-adrenergic agonists and an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density. In 16 patients examined 1-3 months after orthotopic cardiac transplantation, beta-adrenergic receptor density measured by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding in endomyocardial biopsy specimens was not significantly different in transplant recipients compared with normal controls (transplant = 1,429 +/- 199, control = 1,728 +/- 263 fmol/g wet wt; p = NS). However, when normalized to Lowry protein, the [125I]iodocyanopindolol in beta-adrenergic receptor density in biopsy tissue from transplant recipients was significantly lower than in tissue from controls (transplant = 58.1 +/- 6.2, control = 93.5 +/- 13.4 fmol/g Lowry protein; p = 0.011). Atrial sinus node activity of the denervated donor heart and the innervated atrial cuff of the native recipient heart could be detected on the surface electrocardiogram in six patients. In these six patients, the heart rate response to graded infusions of epinephrine (taken up by the adrenergic nerve terminals) and isoproterenol (not taken up by the adrenergic nerve terminals) was measured. The epinephrine dose-response curve in transplanted donor atria was significantly to the left of the native recipient atrial dose-response curve (p less than 0.0001). The isoproterenol dose-response curves for native and transplanted atria were not different. We conclude that myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors are not increased in human orthotopic cardiac allografts and that there is no evidence for beta-receptor-mediated supersensitivity of postsynaptic origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence (8.0%, 14 of 176 patients) was strikingly higher than that for patients without transplant (0.2%) who underwent routine cardiac catheterization. These 14 patients had 21 coronary artery fistulas: single in nine and multiple in five patients. Fifty-two percent arose from the right, 43% from the left anterior descending, and 5% from the circumflex coronary artery. All drained into the right ventricle. Four patients underwent oximetric evaluation, and left-to-right shunting was not detectable. No patient had symptoms attributable to the fistula. Hemodynamic measurements were similar to those of a control group of 28 age- and sex-matched recipients of heart transplant without coronary artery fistula; however, the cardiac index (p = 0.02) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturation (p = 0.03) were significantly higher, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference (p = 0.01) was significantly lower in the group with coronary artery fistula. The histologic features of rejection, large arterioles, or epicardial fat on any biopsy specimen predating coronary artery fistula diagnosis were not associated with the development of the fistula when the two groups were compared. Nine patients (11 coronary artery fistulas) had follow-up studies performed, and three fistulas were larger, three were unchanged, two were smaller, and three had resolved. No complications of coronary artery fistula developed during a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 12-42 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors recently diagnosed CRMO in an 8-year-old girl who had complained of toe pain for several weeks. A number of other involved, asymptomatic areas were discovered by bone scan. Biopsy of the lesions did not reveal any pathogens. Antibiotics and inflammatory agents were not used, and the patient recovered. A review of previously reported cases of CRMO showed 1) that this entity affects children almost exclusively, 2) that from two to 18 sites, usually in the extremities, can be affected at one time, and 3) that about 20 percent of the patients develop a pustular rash on their palms and soles. Other than an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, there are no consistent laboratory abnormalities, and cultures of affected bone are negative. Histopathology typically shows a chronic inflammatory response, sometimes with granulomas. Antiinflammatory agents and antibiotics offer little consistent beneficial effect. The disease is self-limited, and patients usually recover fully, although exacerbations may occur. In the proper clinical setting, CRMO should be considered, since recognition of this entity avoids costly and potentially harmful diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, the carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) level has been used to estimate the severity of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Through extensive clinical experience, we have found this to be an inaccurate correlation; thus, other variables such as pHa or psychometric abnormalities have been assessed to determine severity from CO poisoning. In a 5-yr experience with 247 patients, on admission 114 had an arterial blood gas and HbCO determinations, and 88 also had psychometric testing. The data were evaluated to determine any relationship between pH and HbCO level; a weak correlation (r approximately equal to -0.3) was discovered. A comparison of psychometric testing with HbCO level showed a much stronger statistical relationship. The definition of HbCO poisoning severity may be better determined by psychometric testing than by the HbCO level because psychometric testing measures actual neurologic disability. The weak correlation between both psychometric testing and the HbCO level with pHa reinforces the clinical impression that patients with acidosis, alkalosis, or normal blood gases could have equally severe neurologic symptomatology at HbCO levels ranging from 1% to 62%.\r"

To test whether sclerosis restricts diaphragmatic excursion, we measured diaphragmatic excursion by ultrasonography in subjects with unilateral pleural sclerosis and compared it with diaphragmatic excursions in normal subjects, in subjects with cystic fibrosis (a diffuse bilateral lung disease), and in those who underwent surgical procedures that obliterate the pleural space. In five subjects with unilateral chemical sclerosis, diaphragmatic excursion was significantly less on the sclerosed side than on the contralateral side (10.7 +/- 1.3 vs 17.3 +/- 1.7 mm, mean +/- SEM; p less than .01). Compared with those of normal subjects, the side-to-side differences in excursion were increased by pulmonary disease (p less than .03) and additionally by unilateral sclerosis (p less than .015). There was no significant difference between diaphragmatic excursions on left and right sides of subjects without history of pleural disease. These data suggest that chemical pleural sclerosis causes a measurable reduction in diaphragmatic excursion on the affected side. The physiologic significance of this effect is not known.\r"

  ".W": "Results of isocyanate challenge tests performed on 63 workers referred with a diagnosis of probable isocyanate asthma between 1974 and 1988 were reviewed. Thirty (48 percent) had an acute episode of asthma with a greater than 20 percent decline in FEV1 following subirritant exposure to isocyanates. No difference in the frequency or type of respiratory complaints between isocyanate reactors and nonreactors was found. No differences in lung function results were present when comparing smoking and ex-smoking reactors and nonreactors. In never-smokers with complaints consistent with isocyanate-induced asthma, the presence of obstructive lung disease increased the likelihood that isocyanate-induced asthma was present. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine occurred in nearly all isocyanate reactors but predicted isocyanate-induced asthma in only 68 percent of the workers. In nearly all cases of challenge-confirmed toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma, a 15-min exposure to 20 ppb of the commercial TDI mixture (80:20 2,4:2,6) provoked asthma. Conversely, in the absence of an asthmatic response following exposure to this dose for this duration, a second exposure at this concentration for a longer time would be reasonable to confirm the absence of isocyanate-induced asthma. Among workers employed in the production of polyurethane foam and confirmed to have TDI-induced asthma by inhalation challenge to the different TDI isomers, there appeared to be increased airway reactivity to the 2,6 isomer. This may have relevance to the frequency and intensity of respiratory symptoms that workers with TDI-induced asthma develop in differing industrial settings.\r"

The two groups of patients were similar in respect to age, sex, obesity, preoperative weight loss, diabetes, type of disease, type, and mean duration of surgery. The abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group A and 9.1 percent in group B (difference not significant). The number of patients with infections at nonsurgical sites (respiratory and urinary tract, phlebitis, and septicemia) was significantly greater in group A than in group B (17 vs. 9.1 percent, P less than .05). The mean postoperative hospital stay was similar in both the cefoxitin and cefotetan groups (15.1 vs. 15.9 days).

Moreover, no studies have been done on the neuroendocrine apparatus and glycoprotein production of the heterotopic mucosa. This study reports on a 13-year-old boy, admitted with rectal bleeding and persistent tenesmus. An ulcerative lesion was found on colonoscopy; biopsies revealed a fundic-type gastric tissue. Medical therapy (H2-blockers) promptly healed the rectal ulcer; surgical excision of the heterotopia was performed with complete and permanent relief of symptoms (3-year follow-up). Immunocytochemistry (PAP) revealed 5-Ht and somatostatin cells in the gastric-type mucosa, as in the normal human stomach. These cells also were present in the surrounding rectal epithelium where PYY-enteroglucagon cells were detected, which were absent in the heterotopic tissue. Mucin histochemistry showed PAS-positive cells also strongly stained by LA lectin in the heterotopic tissue, differentiating the rectal epithelium that remained unstained. Therefore, the morphofunctional status (endocrine cells and mucins) of the gastric heterotopia was almost identical to its orthotopic counterpart, confirming the hypothesis that endocrine cells and mucin-producing cells differentiate their metabolic products according to the anatomic and functional activity of the epithelium where they grow.\r"

Experiments have shown that cholesterol synthesis is increased in the small intestine of various diabetic animals. This increase is a generalized phenomenon occurring in all segments of the small intestine. Insulin therapy that normalizes blood glucose levels markedly decreases intestinal cholesterol synthesis in diabetic animals to a level similar to that observed in control animals. Studies have suggested that the hyperphagia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes is the chief stimulus for the increase in intestinal cholesterol synthesis. However, the direct contact of the intestinal mucosa with nutrients is not the sole trigger for increasing cholesterol synthesis in the small intestine, suggesting that circulating and/or neurological factors play a role. The transport of newly synthesized cholesterol, most of which is in the chylomicron lipoprotein fraction, from the intestines to the circulation is increased in diabetic rats. The sterols associated with these chylomicrons are rapidly cleared from the circulation and delivered to the liver. The increased transport of chylomicrons from the intestine to the circulation in diabetic patients could potentially result in several alterations in lipid metabolism that may increase the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "An insulin-degrading enzyme has been purified from human erythrocytes. This enzyme degraded 125I-labeled insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) more slowly than 125I-IGF-II and degraded IGF-II more slowly than 125I-insulin. The time course of 125I-insulin degradation suggested the presence of intermediates, each of which was itself shown to be a substrate for the enzyme. One of these intermediates appeared to be made up entirely of B-chain residues and had HisB10 as its NH2-terminal. The final major radiolabeled degradation product of A14-[125I]monoiodoinsulin was a peptide with TyrA14 at the A-chain NH2 terminal. This peptide could be reduced with dithiothreitol, suggesting that it contained amino acid residues from both A- and B-chains. It was partially precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and anti-insulin antibody but bound poorly to IM-9 lymphocytes. The final major degradation product of B26-[125I]monoiodoinsulin was a peptide whose NH2-terminal was TyrB26 and could not be reduced by dithiothreitol. It was partially precipitated by anti-insulin antibody but was precipitated poorly, if at all, by trichloroacetic acid and bound poorly to IM-9 lymphocytes. The results show that this enzyme degraded insulin by sequential cleavage of peptide bonds on both A- and B-chains. We identified LeuA13-TyrA14, SerB9-HisB10, and PheB25-TyrB26 as three of the bonds that are cleaved.\r"

Obese males, but not obese females, developed hyperglycemia in the fed state and were more glucose intolerant during an intragastric glucose tolerance test than obese females. Lean Wistar fatty rats did not become hyperglycemic on the sucrose diet. Obese males also showed a smaller insulin response during the glucose tolerance test than did obese females. The Wistar fatty rat is a sexually dimorphic model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in which the male but not the female obese rats become diabetic. The diabetic condition and impaired glucose tolerance in the obese male Wistar fatty rat may be related to impaired pancreatic insulin release and peripheral insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Enzymatic glucose sensors are based on the amperometric detection of an oxidable species generated during the oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase. This measurement usually requires a working electrode (anode), an auxiliary electrode (cathode), and a reference electrode, the function of the latter being to keep constant the working potential of the anode, which is responsible for current generation. However, in the needle-type glucose sensors proposed so far, the reference electrode is missing, and its function is performed by the auxiliary electrode. We investigated, in vitro and in vivo in rats, the ability of several cathode-needle materials to behave as a reference electrode in two-electrode glucose sensors, i.e., to present a stable auxiliary electrode potential. In vitro, when glucose concentration was raised from 0 to 30 mM, the auxiliary potential of both gold- and silver-coated sensors presented a cathodic drift, whereas that of silver/silver chloride-coated sensors remained stable. In vivo, during insulin-induced hypoglycemia (5.9-2.4 mM), the auxiliary potentials of all sensors remained stable, whereas during glucose infusion (mean blood glucose concentration 11.2 mM), the auxiliary potentials of both gold- and silver-coated sensors presented an anodic drift, whereas those of silver/silver chloride-coated sensors remained stable. We also indirectly quantified the changes in sensor response induced by variations in the working potential in vitro and in vivo, simulating those that might be produced by a drift in the auxiliary potential. Such changes in the working potential could bring about a 30% unspecific variation in sensor response. We conclude that improvements in sensor analytical characteristics should be obtained with silver/silver-chloride-coated cathodes.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) are currently the subject of intensive investigation as potential markers for autoimmune insulitis. However, the results of different reports vary widely. In an attempt to elucidate the reasons for the discrepant reports and to initiate standardization procedures, the International Diabetes Workshop (IDW) undertook two studies in which 22 centers worldwide measured IAA in coded samples. The variance in binding signal from the 49 sera in study 1 was considerable, even when results were standardized, but was largely systematic and attributable to basic differences in assay type (liquid phase versus solid phase) and to differences in the ligand used (human vs. nonhuman insulin). In study 2, 5 sera were prepared and presented blindly to compare dilution curves, insulin-species specificity, interference from irrelevant serum proteins, precision, and dose-dependent displaceability. Many assays, both liquid and solid phase, were influenced by marked and unpredictable nonspecific binding, revealed by loss of parallelism between dilution curves in pooled normal serum and buffer, by variable binding signals with different normal sera, and by difficulty in distinguishing human insulin-specific from cross-reactive IAA sera. It was concluded from the experience of both studies that variance could probably be reduced by using a standard curve with derived common units, a single species of ligand, and methodology to minimize the effect of nonspecific binding. Variation related to assay type was probably due to liquid- versus solid-phase systems being differentially more sensitive to certain aspects of antigen-antibody binding; this issue will be addressed in future serum exchanges and workshops.\r"

Downregulation induced by insulin was time and dose dependent. After a 20-h incubation with 1 microM insulin, Scatchard analysis revealed approximately 80% loss of insulin receptors. Studies of receptor half-life indicated that treatment with insulin accelerated the degradation of both the alpha- and beta-subunits of the insulin receptor by 30-60%. In addition, biosynthetic-labeling studies indicated that insulin inhibited the biosynthesis of the insulin-receptor precursor by greater than 30%. This decreased biosynthesis of the precursor was associated with decreased production of mature receptor subunits. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from control cells and cells treated for 24 h with 100 nM insulin. Slot blots and Northern transfers revealed that insulin induced an approximately 50% decrease in insulin-receptor mRNA levels. Therefore, these studies indicate that insulin may diminish the concentration of its receptors in target cells by at least two mechanisms: acceleration of receptor degradation and inhibition of receptor biosynthesis at the level of mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "89121201\r", 
  ".W": "Although there is compelling pharmacological evidence based on Ca2+-channel antagonist studies suggesting that the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels regulate insulin release, no direct comparison with Ca2+ currents exists. This is particularly important because of the recent demonstration in other cell types of one and possibly two Ca2+ channels that are insensitive to Ca2+-channel antagonists, the dihydropyridines and the phenylalkylamines. Using an SV40-transformed pancreatic beta-cell line (HIT cells), we determined how voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are involved in stimulus-secretion coupling. Ca2+ currents were measured with the tight-seal technique for whole-cell recording. The cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was followed with the fluorescent probe Fura 2, and the measurements were compared with insulin secretion stimulated by depolarizing the cells with K+. The Ca2+ current contained two components: a rapidly decaying current activated at -50 to -40 mV that decayed with a time constant of 25 ms and a very slowly decaying component activated at -40 mV. Both components were sensitive to the Ca2+-channel antagonist nimodipine. There is excellent agreement in the concentration of nimodipine that inhibited Ca2+ and the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to K+ depolarization (IC50 of 15 and 6 nM, respectively). Nimodipine inhibited insulin release over a similar dose-response range with an IC50 of 1.5 x 10(-9) M. These studies indicate that the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to beta-cell depolarization can be accounted for by the influx of this ion through a single class of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane.\r"

  ".U": "89121203\r", 
  ".W": "Mouse islets were used to study whether mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient to account for acetylcholine (ACh) amplification of glucose-induced insulin release. In the presence of 15 mM glucose, the acceleration of 45Ca efflux and insulin release by 1-100 microM ACh increased with the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (0.25-2.5 mM). Low concentrations of the Ca2+-channel blockers D 600 (1 microM) or nifedipine (0.1 microM) partially inhibited glucose-induced insulin release and its amplification by ACh. At higher concentrations, D 600 (25 microM) or nifedipine (2 microM) practically abolished the ionic and secretory effects of 1 microM ACh. However, 100 microM ACh still caused a fast, large, but transient acceleration of 45Ca efflux, accompanied by a small, short-lived release of insulin. Similar results were obtained in a Ca2+-free medium, indicating that this peak of 45Ca efflux reflects Ca2+ mobilization. Addition of nifedipine or omission of Ca2+ during ACh stimulation rapidly and strongly inhibited 45Ca efflux and insulin release. Both glucose and ACh-induced 45Ca uptake were inhibited by D 600. Only high concentrations of ACh (100 microM) mobilize enough cellular Ca2+ to trigger a small and transient insulin release when Ca2+ influx is prevented or impossible. A continuous influx of Ca2+ is necessary for low ACh concentrations to increase release and for high concentrations to have a sustained effect. The amplification of release by the neurotransmitter results from a slight enhancement of Ca2+ influx associated with a marked increase in the effectiveness of incoming Ca2+ on the releasing machinery.\r"

ACh and NE were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Diabetic rats showed low body weight and heart weight at 2, 4, and 8 wk and higher heart-to-body weight ratio and bradycardia at 8 wk, almost all of which were normalized after insulin treatment. Myocardial ACh and NE concentrations in the diabetic rats at 2 and 4 wk were not significantly different from those in age-matched control rats. However, ACh and NE concentrations in the diabetic rats at 8 wk significantly increased compared with the control rats. Diabetic rats at 8 wk also had increased myocardial choline concentration and choline acetyltransferase activity and decreased acetylcholinesterase activity. Insulin treatment normalized all of these changes in the diabetic rats. Thus, in STZ-induced diabetes (STZ-D), the concentrations of both cholinergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitters in the myocardium increased. The results of this study confirm a previously reported increase in sympathetic activity to the heart and also indicate that there is an increase in the synthesis and a decrease in the metabolism of ACh in STZ-D and that adequate insulin treatment normalizes these changes.\r"

Before treatment, the proportions of total T-lymphocytes (CD3+) and helper-inducer T-lymphocytes (CD4+) were normal, whereas significantly decreased values of suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+), as compared with normal controls, were found in 31% of the patients. The interleukin 2 (IL-2)-receptor expression was significantly increased in IDDM patients compared with control subjects, although the single values were low: patients, 2.02 +/- 0.41%; controls, 0.88 +/- 0.25% (means +/- SE). Circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor were also significantly increased in IDDM patients compared with controls: patients, 372.3 +/- 25.4 U/ml; controls, 235.5 +/- 29.3 U/ml (means +/- SE). However, no major abnormalities were found in mitogen (phytohemagglutinin)-induced IL-2 production, cell proliferation, or IL-2-receptor expression. After 6 mo of cyclosporin treatment, no major modifications of any of the parameters analyzed were noted, even in patients who had cyclosporin blood trough levels greater than 300 ng/ml, i.e., the threshold value associated with clinical efficacy. One explanation for the absence of a major effect of cyclosporin, in contrast with its demonstrated clinical effectiveness, is the reversibility of its activity. Our results preclude the use of the described tests to reliably monitor IDDM patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

However, there is no detailed information about the effect of glycemic control on this abnormality. We investigated the effect of glycemic control by dietary treatment on serum proinsulin level in the basal state and in response to an oral glucose load. Ten NIDDM patients (7 men and 3 women), aged 19-60 yr, with mean (+/- SD) body mass index of 28 +/- 6 kg/m2 (range 21-42 kg/m2) and normal renal and liver function were studied. Before and after dietary therapy (25-30 kcal/kg ideal body wt), 100-g oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Proinsulin was measured with our proinsulin-specific antiserum, which recognizes the connecting site of the B-chain of insulin and C-peptide. After dietary treatment, fasting plasma glucose decreased from 197 +/- 35 to 113 +/- 18 mg/dl (P less than .001). Both serum insulin and proinsulin decreased (insulin from 15 +/- 8 to 10 +/- 4 microU/ml, P less than .02; proinsulin from 31 +/- 18 to 13 +/- 5 pM, P less than .02), and the molar ratio of proinsulin to insulin also tended to decrease (from 0.321 +/- 0.08 to 0.24 +/- 0.10, P less than .10). Insulin response to oral glucose increased after dietary treatment, whereas proinsulin response did not change, resulting in a significant decrease in the molar ratio of the area under the curve of proinsulin to insulin after glucose load (from 0.28 +/- 0.12 to 0.13 +/- 0.07, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of PYY on gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)-stimulated insulin release in conscious dogs with gastric and duodenal fistulas. In control experiments, 6 dogs received GIP (400 pmol/kg, i.v., for 1 h) and glucose (0.6 g/kg, i.v., for 1 h); the integrated insulin response over a 1-h period was 142 +/- 32.7 ng-60 min/ml. The plasma GIP levels achieved by this procedure were similar to those observed by intraduodenal infusion of Lipomul (2 ml/min), suggesting that the dose of GIP used was within the physiologic range. Intravenous infusion of three different doses of PYY (100, 200, or 400 pmol/kg.h) caused a significant inhibition of insulin release stimulated by GIP + glucose; the integrated insulin response was reduced to 105, 88, and 79 ng-60 min/ml, respectively. On the other hand, PYY (400 pmol/kg.h) had no effect on insulin secretion induced by intravenous glucose (0.6 g/kg.h) alone. These results indicate that PYY specifically inhibits the insulinotropic action of GIP and that PYY may play a negative-feedback regulatory role in the enteroinsular axis.\r"

Patients were evaluated at entry and at the end of the 6-wk study by upper gastrointestinal manometry, scintigraphic evaluation of gastric emptying of solids and liquids, measurement of body weight, and scoring of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and distention. Cisapride and placebo groups were strictly comparable for all parameters assessed. Cisapride resulted in a significant increase in the gastric emptying of solids (p less than 0.05) compared with placebo; cisapride also tended to increase the postcibal antral motility and normalize the abnormal manometric features in the patients with intestinal dysmotility, particularly the characteristics of fasting interdigestive motor complexes and the fed motor pattern. Both cisapride and placebo groups showed an improvement in total symptom scores and there was no significant difference in overall symptom response between the two groups. However, the change in abdominal pain was greater with cisapride (p = 0.07). Cisapride facilitates gastric emptying in patients with upper gut dysmotility. The overall symptomatic benefit during a 6-wk trial of cisapride, 10 mg t.i.d., was not greater than that of placebo, and dose-response as well as longer term trials are necessary to determine the clinical efficacy of this medication.\r"

Serum concentrations of the drug were well reproducible within 1 wk. Octreotide significantly raised 24-h median intragastric pH on day 1, but no longer on day 6. Peptone-stimulated gastric acid and volume secretion were markedly less suppressed by octreotide on day 7 compared with day 2. Peptone-stimulated gastrin release was abolished on days 2 and 7, as was peptone-stimulated insulin release. Blood glucose was altered in a biphasic pattern on days 2 and 7. All effects of octreotide were without clear-cut dose-response relationship. A mean half-life of 115 min was calculated. Dose-unrelated side effects (e.g., abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and fatty stools) were registered. In conclusion, octreotide is a powerful inhibitor of gastric acid and volume secretion during acute treatment. Its loss of efficacy during a 1-wk administration may be due to the adaptation of somatostatin receptors and hormonal counterregulation.\r"

Under basal conditions the ECL cells divided very slowly. A progressive increase in the ECL cell labeling index was observed from the second day of omeprazole treatment. The ECL cell density increased progressively from the ninth day of treatment. The plasma gastrin levels were doubled and the labeling index of the cells in the progenitor cell zone was significantly increased. Our data indicate that the omeprazole-evoked ECL cell hyperplasia is a result of accelerated self-replication. The positive correlation between the plasma gastrin concentration and the ECL cell labeling index is compatible with a causal relationship between circulating gastrin levels and increased ECL cell density.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of glucose, galactose, and lactitol on intestinal calcium absorption and gastric emptying were studied in 9, 8, and 20 healthy subjects, respectively. Calcium absorption was measured by using a double-isotope technique and the kinetic parameters were obtained by a deconvolution method. The gastric emptying rate was determined with 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and was expressed as the half-time of the emptying curve. Each subject was studied under two conditions: (a) with calcium alone and (b) with calcium plus sugar. Glucose and galactose increased the calcium mean transit time and improved the total fractional calcium absorption by 30% (p less than 0.02). Lactitol decreased the mean rate of absorption (p less than 0.001) and reduced the total fractional calcium absorption by 15% (p less than 0.001). The gastric emptying rate did not appear to influence directly the kinetic parameters of calcium absorption. These results show that both glucose and galactose exert the same stimulatory effect as lactose on calcium absorption in subjects with normal lactase whereas lactitol mimics the effects of lactose in lactase-deficient patients. Thus the absorbability of sugars determines their effect on calcium absorption.\r"

Ninety-seven patients with IBD described problems they had experienced as a result of the disease; the 32 most frequent and important items were included in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Sixty-one IBD patients were evaluated twice. One month separated the evaluations, at which disease activity indices, the IBDQ, and a number of other questionnaires were administered. Reproducibility studies in 19 stable patients showed improvement in scores, but also a small within-person standard deviation. Responsiveness studies revealed large changes in scores in patients who had improved or deteriorated and suggested that the IBDQ was more responsive than a general health status measure. Responsiveness appeared greater in patients with ulcerative colitis than in those with Crohn's disease. Predicted and observed correlations between changes in IBDQ score and changes in other measures were similar. We conclude that although further testing is required, particularly in examining the relation between changes in the IBDQ and changes in the activity of Crohn's disease, the IBDQ shows promise as a measure of health status for clinical trials in IBD.\r"

  ".W": "Comparative measurements of portal vein blood flow were performed at laparatomy in anesthetized dogs using either a pulsed Doppler echo system or electromagnetic flowmeters. Three hundred four simultaneous determinations were obtained under baseline conditions and during vasopressin and glucagon infusions. In each dog, serial triplicate measurements were taken within 10 min of each other. In all the cases, flow changes induced by vasoactive drugs followed the same direction regardless of the method used. Portal vein blood flow as measured by electromagnetic flowmetry ranged from 85 to 1570 ml/min. Portal vein blood flow values obtained with Doppler and electromagnetic flowmeters were not significantly different (609 +/- 335 vs. 600 +/- 370 ml/min; p = NS) and were highly correlated (r = 0.918, p less than 0.001). The difference between values obtained by the two techniques was -3 +/- 159 ml/min or -1.0% +/- 21.2% (mean +/- SD). This difference was not influenced by the portal vein diameter but increased slightly as a function of the angle of insonation. When considering the mean of triplicate measurements, we also found a highly significant correlation between data obtained by the two techniques (r = 0.934, p less than 0.001; n = 63). The mean difference was 11 ml/min, but limits of agreement between these methods were -267 and +239 ml/min. This relative discrepancy was explained by a coefficient of variation higher in Doppler measurements than in electromagnetic measurements (10.9% vs. 5.9%). These data demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, Doppler flowmetry is probably not an ideal method to measure absolute portal vein blood flow values, and that more sophisticated equipment is needed to improve its reproducibility and accuracy. In humans, however, this method might be a useful tool to assess the direction of portal flow changes in the same individual.\r"

Optimal management of these varied syndromes hinges on the accurate identification of their clinical forms and a thorough search for their possible etiologies.\r"

All participants were black. After incubation with chlortetracycline, platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged into a pellet and fluorescence was measured with a microspectrofluorometer. At an interval of 45 minutes mean fluorescence values were 11% higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (567 +/- 95 vs. 512 +/- 100 counts/sec, p less than 0.02). With both groups of participants combined, a correlation of borderline statistical significance was noted between diastolic blood pressure and chlortetracycline fluorescence (r = 0.213, p = 0.056). In parallel experiments, sodium and potassium concentrations were measured in red blood cells. Intracellular sodium was also significantly higher in the hypertensive group (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that the total cell burden of calcium is increased in the platelets of hypertensive individuals, possibly a result of abnormal cell metabolism of calcium, and further suggest that circulating platelets in hypertensive individuals may be in a hyperaggregable state.\r"

Over half the angiomas developed within the first 5 years of life, but only three patients reportedly had lesions at birth. The clinical course was variable, but most of the lesions slowly extended, eventually covering a large part of the trunk and neck in some patients. Despite the progressive spread of angiomas, they appear to be benign, and malignant change has not been encountered. The microscopic appearance of the angiomatous tufts shows some similarity to the angiomatous tissue of strawberry angioma, but the angiomatous lobules are much larger and extend deeper in the latter condition. Cell marker studies suggest that the cell lobules of the angiomas consist of closely packed blood capillary endothelial and perithelial cells. Familiarity with distinctive histologic features of tufted angioma should prevent these lesions from being misdiagnosed as either Kaposi's sarcoma or as angiosarcoma.\r"

There were two kinds. One, arranged in chains, had been called streptococci already; the other, in clumps, he named staphylococci. He injected micrococci into animals. If blood poisoning occurred in them, it followed localized tissue infection. This information, applied to surgical events, suggested that the \"hospital diseases\" were a sequel to wound suppuration and explained why antiseptic surgery controlled both conditions. Ogston's observations are now common knowledge, but Lister rejected them. It is suggested he did so because he relied on intuition rather than experiment. The scene is set for Lister and Ogston's discoveries by a review of the historical background. Patients subjected to surgery faced a terrible ordeal and a very real chance of death from the mysterious hospital diseases. Surgeons viewed the mortality with bland detachment, blaming fate. But Simpson and Semmelweis were deeply concerned. However, puerperal fever was regarded as entirely distinct from the hospital diseases, and neither condition connected in any way with suppuration in wounds. Simpson, Semmelweis, Lister, and Ogston all found their ideas scorned by members of the profession, which may have feared being held responsible for deaths. Ogston's achievement lives on, but he has been forgotten. We should remember him.\r"

The histologic and histochemical differences between varicose and normal veins are presented. The pathophysiology of varicose veins is related to congential or acquired abnormalities of the deep venous system, venous valves, and/or fascial or vein wall weakness. Increased deep venous pressure may be both proximal and distal in etiology, arising from arteriovenous anastomoses, incompetent communicating veins, or venous obstruction. Primary valvular incompetence arises from venous obstruction (thrombosis), thrombophlebitis, or valvular agenesis. Secondary valvular incompetence occurs from deep venous obstruction or increased venous distensibility (usually secondary to circulating estrogens). Finally, fascial weakness of the vein wall or supporting fascia provided a genetic basis for the pathophysiology of varicose veins. Understanding the anatomy and pathophysiology of varicose veins should lead to a more rational and efficacious treatment.\r"

Use a syringe suited to the size of your hand. The disposable 3-cc syringe fits most hands, and does not require a reload after injection of 1 cc of sclerosant. The TBC syringe may be too long, and holds only 1 cc of sclerosant. 2. Be sure your needle is sharp. Change your needle as often as needed. It is surprising what a difference this can make. 3. Magnify your work! 4. Once you are in the vein, keep your eye on target (the needle point). A fractional deviation can cause you to perforate the tiny blood vessel. 5. Don't aim your needle under the vein; go parallel to it. 6. Inject a small bolus of air before the sclerosant solution. This ensures that you are in the venule and reduces chances of local side effects. Therefore, the syringe and needle must be tilted up, or else the bolus of air is behind the solution. 7. Remember to always store your hypertonic saline separately from all other injectables.\r"

The present studies were carried out to further characterize the functional role of the CD16 Ag and the mechanisms whereby cytotoxicity is activated by using human NK clones. In phenotypic studies Fc gamma RIII was found to be expressed heterogeneously on various human cloned NK cells. Expression on CD3- and CD3+ clones varied with the donor and mAb used for detection. Functional data demonstrated that cytotoxicity against NK-resistant target cells can be induced in CD3-CD16+ NK clones and CD3+CD16+ clones with NK activity when various CD16 mAb were used. CD16 antibodies but not reactive isotype control antibodies induced cytotoxicity. In contrast to complete CD16 antibodies F(ab')2 fragments were not able to activate the cytotoxic mechanism. Both an antibody against FcR on the target cell (Fc gamma RII) and a CD11a antibody blocked induction of cytotoxicity. These results suggest that three steps are critical for activation of CD16+ cells via Fc gamma RIII: 1) specific binding of CD16 antibodies to Fc gamma RIII on effector cells irrespective of the epitope recognized; 2) cross-linking of effector cell CD16 Ag through binding of the Fc site of CD16 antibodies via corresponding FcR on the target cell membrane; and 3) interaction of CD11a/18 molecules with the target cell membrane.\r"

Mice were protected from septic death if IL-2 was administered i.p. within 1 h after the bacterial challenge. Optimal protection was provided by treating the lethally challenged mice with rIL-2 at 1 and 5 h or 1, 5, and 10 h after the bacterial challenge and was dose-dependent (greater than or equal to 5.0 x 10(5) U/kg). Furthermore, treatment of mice with anti-IL-2R antibody abolished the protective effect induced by rIL-2 administration. These data suggest that the rIL-2-induced protection against septic death in mice is mediated by a cell type expressing a functional IL-2R. One potentially important therapeutic application of rIL-2 may be to modulate the course of sepsis once the host has been exposed to potentially lethal microbial pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic inflammatory diseases in humans have been intensively investigated, however the immune mechanisms underlying diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, and periodontal disease (PD) remain elusive. In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of IgM, IgG, and IgA secreting cells with emphasis on the IgG and IgA subclasses among mononuclear cell populations isolated from gingiva at different stages of PD. Surgically removed tissues were treated with Dispase to gently dissociate cells and the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation was used to enrich for viable mononuclear cells rich in lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells. The total numbers of plasma cells increased with the severity of disease. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that most Ig-containing cells were of the IgG isotype; however, significant numbers of IgA-positive cells but few IgM-positive cells were seen. This isolation procedure allowed analysis, at the single cell level, of the distribution of IgG and IgA subclasses of antibody-secreting cells with monoclonal antibodies to human IgG and IgA subclasses. For this, we selected four monoclonal anti-IgG subclass (anti-gamma 1, -gamma 2, -gamma 3, and -gamma 4) antibodies with no subclass cross reactivity for use in the enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Analysis of slight, moderate, and advanced stages of PD showed a progressive increase in spotforming cells (SFC) numbers, and the major isotype of SFC was IgG followed by IgA. The major IgG subclass SFC seen was IgG1 followed by IgG2 whereas similar numbers of IgG3 and IgG4 SFC were observed, a pattern also seen with cells from synovium of RA patients and in mitogen-triggered spleen and PBMC. In terms of the IgA subclass distribution, IgA1 predominated in moderate stages, whereas a selective increase in IgA2 SFC were seen in the more advanced stage of PD. These results show that significant numbers of viable plasma cells/Ig-secreting cells can be isolated from inflamed gingival tissues. Further, careful analysis has shown that IgG subclass responses in gingiva are similar to those found in synovia of RA subjects, and in stimulated PBMC and spleen. However, it should be noted that the number of IgG4- and IgA2-secreting cells increased in the advanced stage of PD.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism(s) underlying the potent accessory cell function of dendritic cells (DC) remains unclear. The possibility was considered that a soluble factor(s) released during the interaction of DC and T cells might contribute to the potent T cell activating function of DC. Culture supernatants were generated from mixtures of murine spleen DC and periodate-treated spleen T cells and were examined for the presence of known cytokine activities and factors capable of enhancing T cell responsiveness to IL-2. Serum-free supernatants from 24 h DC-T cell co-cultures exhibited high levels of IL-2, detectable levels of IL-3, and negligible levels of IL-1, -4, -5, -6, and TNF. A factor(s) was also identified with an apparent Mr of 12.5 to 17.0 kDa, henceforth designated IL-2 enhancing factor (IL-2EF), which enhanced the IL-2-induced proliferation of murine thymocytes, CTLL, and HT-2 cells by approximately three- to fourfold. This enhancement was also observed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to murine IL-1 alpha, -1 beta, -3, -4, -5, -6, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, TNF, and IFN-gamma. However, IL-2EF failed to enhance: 1) the activity of IL-1, -3, -4, -5, or -6 on cells responsive to these cytokines; 2) IL-2-augmented, IL-5-induced BCL1 proliferation; and 3) either PHA- or Con A-stimulated thymocyte proliferation. Moreover, neither IFN-gamma nor GM-CSF exhibited IL-2EF activity. When DC and T cells were cultured separately (after an initial 12 h co-culture period), IL-2EF activity resided predominantly in the T cell-derived supernatants. These and other data indicate that IL-2EF, a heat-labile T cell-derived 12.5 to 17.0 kDa protein, is distinct from IL-1 alpha, -1 beta, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, TNF, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and previously described factors that co-stimulate thymocyte proliferation in the presence of Con A or PHA. It is suggested that IL-2EF functions to specifically enhance IL-2-driven T cell proliferation and contributes to the potent activation of T cells induced by DC.\r"

Eight peptides, six of which were not overlapping, induced proliferation of lymphocytes from one to five volunteers, suggesting either genetic restriction of response to each of the T epitopes, or dominance of some T sites on the immunizing sporozoites. The 28 volunteers were radically cured of malaria and during the next 126 days 25 of the 28 were reinfected. Resistance to malaria was not correlated with antibodies to malaria Ag, but was significantly correlated with lymphocyte responses to CS protein residues 361-380 and 371-390. Among the 25 volunteers who became re-infected with malaria, lymphocytes from only two responded to a peptide including residues 361-380 of the P. falciparum CS protein, and only one to peptide 371-390. In contrast, lymphocytes from all three volunteers who did not become infected responded to peptide 361-380 (p = 0.003), and lymphocytes from two of the three responded to peptide 371-390 (p = 0.023). The significant correlation between proliferation to peptides 361-380 and 371-390 and resistance to malaria suggests that at least one epitope within these overlapping peptides is involved in a protective cellular immune response. The data support inclusion of these residues in future CS protein vaccines.\r"

The kinetics of killing are characterized by initial target bacterial multiplication, followed by rapid bacterial death. Experiments demonstrates that for each donor there is a threshold number of effector cells necessary to observe a net killing effect. Below the threshold, even use of high effector-to-target ratios lack killing activity and the bacterial growth cannot be stopped. In contrast, if the number of NK cells is larger than the threshold, complete killing is achieved, even at ratios as low as 1/1000. The threshold number varies among donors, ranging between 1200 and 12000 purified NK cells/tube, and provides a quantitative measure of antibacterial activity. Performing the assay at 4 degrees C raised the threshold number required for killing. Experiments performed in Boyden chambers confirm that NK cell-bacteria contact is not necessary for efficient killing, although the kinetics of bacterial lysis is slower. The fit between model and data supports the hypothesis that the bactericidal mechanism is extracellular and is mediated by an anti-microbial factor released from NK cells. Accumulated evidence also indicates that this factor is distinguishable from the mechanisms mediating tumor cell cytotoxicity.\r"

To determine the effects of LPS on TNF activity and the pulmonary inflammatory response in vivo, we challenged rats systemically or intratracheally with LPS. Intravenous LPS significantly increased serum TNF content from nondetectable levels in control specimens to peak levels at 90 min, which declined to baseline by 3 h. In response to intratracheal LPS, levels of TNF both in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and associated with alveolar macrophages increased significantly from near nondetectable levels in control animals. Increases in TNF levels were confined to the LPS-challenged compartment. Intravenous LPS resulted in a decrease in the number of peripheral blood neutrophils and in sequestration of these cells within the pulmonary vasculature. In contrast, intratracheal LPS elicited a marked intraalveolar inflammatory response.\r"

The F glycoprotein remained cell associated, whereas the Ft glycoprotein was secreted into the media of infected cells. In contrast to the processing of the F0 precursor into its F1 and F2 subunits that was observed in mammalian cells, a second cleavage site within the F1 subunit was recognized by the insect cell proteases and resulted in the formation of two F1 subunits. The baculovirus-expressed Ft glycoprotein induced neutralizing antibodies in cotton rats and protected vaccinated animals from challenge with respiratory syncytial virus.\r"

All five patients were farmers. All patients, with the possible exception of one who had hemoglobin typing performed after receiving a blood transfusion, had thalassemia hemoglobinopathy syndrome. Fungal isolation was difficult. Amphotericin B treatment seemed to be ineffective. Radical surgical removal of infected tissues and oral administration of a saturated solution of potassium iodide are proposed therapy. In the tropics, where Pythium is ubiquitous, one should actively look for this fungal infection in patients with unexplained arterial occlusion, especially in the case of patients with thalassemia hemoglobinopathy syndrome.\r"

For beta-lactams, Emaxs were similar, whereas P50s increased 10- to 50-fold with longer intervals in both models. Aminoglycosides were significantly more bactericidal in the lung than in the thigh, and dosing interval had little impact on P50s in either model.

Quantitative cultures of the catheter insertion site (25 cm2) revealed significantly greater colonization (P less than or equal to .009) after 48 h in the transparent versus the gauze dressing group. Local catheter-related infection occurred significantly more often (P = .002) in the transparent (62%) than in the gauze group (24%). Seven episodes of catheter-related bacteremia occurred in the transparent group (16.6%) and none in the gauze group (P = .015). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that cutaneous colonization at the insertion site of greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu/mL (relative risk, 13.16) and difficulty of insertion (relative risk, 5.39) were significant factors for catheter-related infection. These data suggest that transparent dressings are associated with significantly increased rates of insertion site colonization, local catheter-related infection, and systemic catheter-related sepsis in patients with long-term central venous catheters.\r"

  ".W": "Entamoeba histolytica, a cause of invasive colitis or liver abscess, is responsible for substantial worldwide morbidity and mortality. An understanding of the biochemical basis for the parasite adherence and cytolytic activities and antiamebic host immune response mechanisms are prerequisites for vaccine development. The E. histolytica galactose (Gal) or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) inhibitable adherence lectin mediates attachment of trophozoites to colonic mucins or mammalian target cells. Amebic cytolysis of target cells requires Gal/GalNAc-lectin-mediated adherence, parasite phospholipase A activity, and maintenance of an acid pH in amebic intracellular vesicles. Cytolytic activity is stimulated by phorbol esters (activators of protein kinase C) and results from an E. histolytica-mediated increase in free Ca++ within the target cell. The Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin is a highly conserved antigen that is universally recognized by human immune sera; patients cured of invasive amebiasis possess antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity effective in vitro against E. histolytica trophozoites. Promising vaccines include the purified adherence lectin, for eliciting an intestinal secretion of IgA antibody to lectin, and additional E. histolytica antigens, which elicit cell-mediated amebicidal responses.\r"

HMAbs Z01 and X20 immunoprecipitated a major protein at 64 kDa. HMAb Z02 immunoprecipitated a major protein of 48-50 kDa.

A fetal IgM response to T. pallidum antigens with apparent molecular masses of 72, 47, 45, 42, 37, 17, and 15 kDa was observed among sera of infants with congenital syphilis. Fractionation of sera into IgM and IgG components by high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that fetal IgM antibodies in every case were directed specifically against a 47-kDa antigen. Two asymptomatic infants from group II also showed serum IgM reactivities with the 47-kDa antigen, thereby appearing to confirm in utero infection.

Unlike serum from neonatal rats injected with albumin, serum from neonatal rats injected with human IgG opsonized and killed E. coli K1 efficiently. Heat treatment abolished the bactericidal effect of serum from IgG recipients, suggesting a role for complement. A radioimmunobinding assay demonstrated that the capacity of neonatal rat serum to deposit IgG and C3 onto E. coli K1 was impaired. However, intraperitoneal human IgG enabled serum from neonatal rats to deposit human IgG onto the bacteria and enhanced C3 deposition to a level equivalent to that observed with adult rat serum. Therefore, neonatal rats have a functionally competent classic pathway of complement.

Only 40 of the 53 pairs of isolates could be analyzed by plasmid profiles; 36 of these 40 were concordant with RFLP analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns showed poor concordance with RFLP analysis. This study demonstrates the utility of RFLP analysis and indicates that isolation of E. coli from elderly women after sterilization of the urinary tract usually results from introduction of a new strain; elderly women who fail antibiotic therapy or receive no therapy may remain persistently infected with the same E. coli strain.\r"

No such priming of leukocyte activation occurred if phorbol myristate acetate was used as a stimulant or if bovine serum albumin was substituted for the type 1 pili preparations. When free in solution, neither pili preparation directly stimulated cellular oxidative metabolism. Type 1 pili-mediated priming was not inhibited by polymyxin B, by mannose congeners, or by boiling the pili preparations but was prevented by trypsinization of the pili. This priming property indicates a further means by which type 1 pili may modulate the inflammatory response of the host and provides another tool that can be used to dissect the relationship between the structure and function of type 1 pili and to characterize leukocyte receptors for these pili.\r"

In addition, the effectiveness of a 2-g single dose of metronidazole was compared with a seven-day course of 500 mg of metronidazole twice a day in patients with bacterial vaginosis. Statistically significant benefits of partner treatment were noted in the initial cure rate by Gram-stained smear criteria (P less than .01) and in percentage of women with symptoms eight weeks after initiating therapy (P less than .05). The seven-day course of metronidazole was superior to the single-dose regimen in the percentage of patients with clue cells and the percentage of patients with a positive \"sniff\" test at the first follow-up visit; however, differences in the initial cure rate assessed by clinical criteria and Gram-stained smear criteria were not statistically significant between the two patient treatment regimens. Recurrence rates by Gram-stained smear criteria between patient and partner treatment groups at five and eight weeks after initiation of treatment were also not significantly different between the two patient regimens. Single-dose metronidazole treatment of the sexual partner of women with bacterial vaginosis improves initial bacterial vaginosis cure rates. The seven-day course of metronidazole was not found by statistical analysis to be significantly superior to single-dose therapy when considering initial cure rates by clinical or Gram-stained smear criteria or recurrence rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three decades of psychiatric practice with tricyclic, tetracyclic, and heterocyclic antidepressants have shown that these drugs are effective not only for major depression, endogenous depression in particular, but also for a range of other disorders. Tricyclic and other antidepressants are now used to treat enuresis and attention-deficit disorders in children, bulimia and anorexia nervosa, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain, migraine, and peptic ulcer disease. As with some of the antidepressants, the body of literature on the relationship between clinical response in these diseases and plasma or serum levels of the drugs is not complete or well understood, but for some of these disorders, sufficient preliminary serum level data are available to take advantage of therapeutic drug monitoring as an adjunct to treatment. Therapeutic monitoring can be particularly important where studies indicate that successful therapy occurs at blood levels substantially different from those used to treat depression. This paper presents a brief overview of antidepressant treatment of these disorders, focusing on the available pharmacologic data related to serum level measurements and their relation to clinical response.\r"

The explanation of this finding is that (a) disruption of any circuit, whether taking place in the connections or in the nuclei, leads to dysfunction and (b) thalamofrontal connections are not topographically arranged according to the thalamic nuclei, but show a frontal rostrocaudal/thalamic mediolateral interrelationship irrespective of thalamic nuclear masses.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo effect of yeast-derived recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rh GM-CSF) was investigated in 30 patients with advanced malignancy in a phase Ib trial. Patients were treated at four different dose levels (120 to 1,000 micrograms/m2/d) by either daily intravenous (IV) bolus injection or 24-hour continuous infusion. Administration of rh GM-CSF resulted in a broad spectrum of dose- and schedule-dependent hematopoietic effects. Sustained infusion of rh GM-CSF elicited a maximum 17-fold average peak increase of the total WBC count with mainly neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes accounting for this rise, and increases in bone marrow cellularity with a shift to immature myeloid elements. Elevation of lymphocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes was not induced. Within five days after discontinuation of treatment the leukocytosis had disappeared. Adverse reactions encountered with rh GM-CSF seen in 65% of the patients studied were never life-threatening and always rapidly reversible. They included mild myalgias, facial flushing, low-grade fever, headache, bone discomfort, nausea, dyspnea, and transient decline of platelet counts. These results suggest that rh GM-CSF can be safely administered at the doses and schedules used and that it can induce in vivo some of the biological effects reported in in vitro studies. Although no objective antitumour responses have been seen, the ability of rh GM-CSF to increase number and function of leukocytes in vivo may prevent neutropenia and infections when GM-CSF is added to cytotoxic cancer therapy.\r"

We performed a phase I study of CBDCA in adult patients with relapsed acute leukemia. Therapy was administered as a five-day continuous infusion. The initial dose of 875 mg/m2 over five days was escalated in 15% increments to a final dose of 2,100 mg/m2 over five days. Twenty-eight patients received 35 induction courses of CBDCA, including two patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) following the first course, and received a second induction course at the time of relapse. Therapy was well tolerated. No grade 3 or 4 extramedullary toxicity was seen. Myelosuppression was regularly observed, with prolonged myelosuppression at 2,100 mg/m2 over five days being the indication to cease dose escalation. Eight of 28 patients (28.5%) responded to CBDCA therapy (six CR, two partial remission [PR]) or ten of 30 initial induction courses (33.3%). Continuous-infusion CBDCA has an advantage over other therapy for acute leukemia because of its highly selective myelotoxicity and minimal gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. A standard phase II study should be undertaken to establish a more accurate response rate.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-one patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease who had failed a mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP)- and a doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD)-like regimen were treated with a high-dose combination chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV) and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Fifty-nine patients were treated in relapse and two were intensified early in third remission. Following therapy, 29 patients (47%) were in complete remission (CR), 18 patients (30%) achieved a partial response (PR), and 14 patients (23%) had progressive disease (PD). Among the partial responders, six patients achieved a CR following addition of local radiation therapy to sites of residual nodal disease. For a minimum follow-up of 2 years, 23 patients (38%) are alive and free of disease. High-dose CBV therapy produced severe myelosuppression, and there were four (7%) treatment-related deaths. A multivariate analysis identified failure of more than two prior chemotherapy treatments and poor performance status as important adverse risk factors for survival. Patients who had no adverse risk factor and/or were intensified with CBV while Hodgkin's disease was still responding to conventional chemotherapy, had a CR rate of 63%, with 77% projected 3-year survival; whereas, all other patients had a CR rate of 31%, and a projected 3-year survival of only 18%. Our results demonstrated that CBV and ABMT can induce remission duration of 2 years or greater in a significant proportion of patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease.\r"

Severe complications occurred in grade III patients, but no deaths were directly linked to the cystitis. Fourteen patients recovered within two to 120 days of onset. The other patients died before the cystitis resolved, either of a relapse of the malignancy or of infection. Predisposing factors were age (increased incidence in older children), conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide, previous vesical irradiation, association with prolonged aplasia, and hepatic complications. The role of busulfan was also probable. No viral agent was found.\r"

Adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) mediates potent antitumor effects in murine tumor models. Clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of these cells in patients with advanced cancer are underway. We have investigated whether infused TIL labeled with indium 111 (111In) oxine can traffic and localize to metastatic deposits of tumor. Six patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who had multiple sites of subcutaneous, nodal, and/or visceral disease were the subjects of the study. The patients received cyclophosphamide 36 hours before receiving the intravenous (IV) infusion of TIL followed by IL-2 IV every eight hours. The distribution and localization of the TIL were evaluated using serial whole body gamma camera imaging, serial blood and urine samplings, and serial biopsies of tumor and normal tissue. 111In-labeled TIL localized to lung, liver, and spleen within two hours after the infusion of activity. Activity in the lung diminished within 24 hours. As early as 24 hours after injection of 111In-labeled TIL, localization of TIL to sites of metastatic deposits was demonstrated in all six patients using either imaging studies or biopsy specimens or both. 111In activity in tumor tissue biopsies ranged from three to 40 times greater than activity in normal tissue. A progressive increase in the radioactive counts at sites of tumor deposit was seen. This study shows that labeled TIL can localize preferentially to tumor, and provides information concerning the possible mechanism of the therapeutic effects of TIL.\r"

  ".W": "The defining histological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, although neither is pathognomonic for this disorder. The distribution of AD histopathology suggests selective neuronal vulnerability, with specific cell populations affected within discrete regions of the cerebral hemispheres and within certain subcortical and brain-stem nuclear areas. At the ultrastructural level, tangles and plaque neurites contain paired helical filaments whose composition is unknown but may include altered cytoskeletal elements. Amyloid, deposited in plaque cores and often focally present within the cerebral vasculature, contains a polypeptide (\"beta-protein,\" or \"beta-amyloid\") encoded by a chromosome 21 gene. At least in occasional families, AD has been linked to a separate chromosome 21 locus, but different underlying genetic factors may operate in other cases. Inorganic substances, including aluminum and silicon, are reported to co-localize within tangle-bearing neurons and plaque cores. Specific environmental agents have not been confirmed to be pathogenetically important, however, but may eventually prove to exert a permissive, facilitatory, or even causative role in many AD patients.\r"

The diagnostic and prognostic value of flow-cytometric DNA analysis was also evaluated using ethanol-fixed paraffin-embedded BUdR-labeled specimens; these were the same specimens as were used for measuring the BUdR and Ki-67 labeling indices. Both the Ki-67 and the BUdR labeling indices correlated with the degree of malignancy estimated from conventional histological preparations. The Ki-67 labeling index was 1.7 times greater than the BUdR labeling index. The relationship of DNA aneuploidy to the labeling indices or to morphology in cases of glioma was examined. All of the tumors with an aneuploid line corresponded to malignant glioma classified by histological criteria, although malignant glioma did not always show DNA aneuploidy. In addition, the cases with aneuploid lines showed high BUdR and Ki-67 labeling indices. The cell kinetic data, which indicate the biological character of tumors, allowed prediction of the prognosis of the patients with gliomas. In contrast, despite the presence of an aneuploid line, three of 13 meningiomas showed a benign histological pattern without an aggressive clinical course, and neither the Ki-67 nor the BUdR labeling index was high. These results indicate an unequivocal relationship between DNA aneuploidy and clinical behavior; in general, both labeling indices may prove to be objective indicators of the outcome of patients with brain tumors.\r"

Presenting symptoms included subarachnoid hemorrhage in 13 and mass effect in 11. Several of these aneurysms were documented to rapidly increase in size over a 3-month to 2-year period of observation. All aneurysms were surgically treated: direct clipping was performed in 14; trapping with bypass in four; trapping alone in four; and direct excision with end-to-end anastomosis in two. The postoperative results were excellent in 21 aneurysms (87%), good in two (8%), and poor in one. The pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms is reviewed.\r"

The authors have sought to establish a stereotaxic technique to predictably deposit dispersed cells in primate brain. Human lymphocytes were cultured in recombinant interleukin-2, labeled with sodium 51 chromate (51Cr), and stereotaxically injected into the frontal white matter of six anesthetized rhesus monkeys. A 10-microliters aliquot of cell suspension (2 X 10(7) cells/ml) was deposited 16 mm deep to the dura at 5 microliters/min via Hamilton No. 22s or 26s needles. Five control aliquots were counted for each injection. Reflux out of the needle track was absorbed on gauze, and the recovered cells were counted. The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after implantation and the brain was removed and sectioned such that the cortex and white matter along the needle track were separate. The tissue sections were then counted. Recovery was expressed as the percentage of total injected radioactivity (cpm) that was present in each brain section. Two additional injected hemispheres were processed for autoradiography and histological study. Cell recovery in the brain (mean +/- standard deviation) was 87.2% +/- 13.9% (3.3% +/- 4.9% in cortex and 83.9% +/- 15.9% in white matter). The autoradiograms and histological examination showed a dense accumulation of radioactivity (cells) at the target site and minimal radioactivity (cells) in the needle track. Accurate intracerebral deposition of dispersed cells in primates was achieved with the technique described. This knowledge permits reliable stereotaxic implantation of cells into the brains of nonhuman primates and humans for investigation and therapy.\r"

A literature review has confirmed a favorable prognosis in at least 50% of patients with this disorder. Seventeen of 35 reported patients are still alive and often seizure-free for a mean period of 7.4 years (range 2 to 18 years) after diagnosis. Five patients have died within 2 years and four between 9 and 25 years after diagnosis of PXA. In some cases in which death followed shortly after diagnosis, there may have been histological confusion between PXA and a malignant glioma with heavily lipidized tumor cells. Nonetheless, transformation of PXA into a malignant astrocytoma or glioblastoma with eventual death may occur many years after initial diagnosis. From the currently reported cases it does not appear possible on clinicopathological grounds to predict which patients will have a favorable prognosis. Optimal management of PXA seems to be primary surgical resection with later surgery for residual or recurrent tumor. The role of radiotherapy in the management of PXA is at this time uncertain.\r"

The authors found that patients prefer that decisions be made principally by their physicians, not themselves, although they very much want to be informed. There was no correlation between patients' decision making and information-seeking preferences (r = 0.09; p = 0.15). For the majority of patients, their desire to make decisions declined as they faced more severe illness. Older patients had less desire than younger patients to make decisions and to be informed (p less than 0.0001 for each comparison). However, only 19% of the variance among patients for decision making and 12% for information seeking could be accounted for by stepwise regression models using sociodemographic and health status variables as predictors. The conceptual and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

These monoclonal antibodies were directed to lacto series type 2 antigens with sugar-chain structures: lactosylceramide, lactoneotetraosylceramide (paragloboside), Lex (a chemically well-defined fucosyl carbohydrate antigen), difucosyl Lex, and sialosyl-difucosyl Lex, respectively. The staining pattern in fetal renal tissue changed significantly according to the stage of organogenesis. In addition, expression of the antigens, especially paragloboside and sialosyl-difucosyl Lex, was closely related to the prognosis of the patient. These results suggest that the expression of a series of oncofetal antigens in development or differentiation of organs is reflected in the reversion to an immature pattern of antigenic expression in tumor tissue. The pattern of antigen expression in renal tumors offers a good criterion for ascertaining the degree of tumor differentiation and malignancy and is valuable for determining prognosis.\r"

Instead, we suggest that GH therapy be evaluated from the perspective of cultural norms. We compare GH therapy for short normal children with currently accepted therapies for non--life-threatening pediatric conditions such as well-child care, cosmetic therapy, treatment of psychological problems, and invasive outpatient therapy for chronic conditions. Based on this analysis, we argue that the burdens of therapy, the uncertainty about long-term risks and benefits, the unclear therapeutic end point, and the implications for child health policy place routine GH therapy for children without documented deficiency of GH secretion outside current pediatric ethical norms. Such therapy is properly administered within a comprehensive clinical research protocol.\r"

Yet most research on its prevention and treatment has focused on perimenopausal women, although there are significant differences between perimenopausal and older women in factors related to bone mineral metabolism, rates of bone loss, the structural integrity of remaining bone, risk factors for fractures, and the types of fractures sustained. Currently recommended therapies, which slow bone loss in perimenopausal women, may be of less benefit for older women whose loss of bone has already slowed or ceased and whose remaining bone may be of inadequate quantity and quality to prevent fracture. Thus, the application of currently available modalities is unlikely to mitigate significantly the consequences of osteoporosis in this population. Further research is urgently needed, and some directions for future investigation are suggested.\r"

The mechanism of injury has been studied in the sheep lung lymph preparation, where it has been demonstrated that the reperfusion resulting in pulmonary edema is due to an increase in microvascular permeability of the lung to protein. This respiratory failure caused by reperfusion appears to be an inflammatory reaction associated with intravascular release of the chemoattractants leukotriene B4 and thromboxane. Histological studies of the lung in experimental animals revealed significant accumulation of neutrophils but not platelets in alveolar capillaries. We conclude that thromboxane generated and released from the ischemic tissue is responsible for the transient pulmonary hypertension. Second, it is likely that the chemoattractants are responsible for leukosequestration, and, third, neutrophils, oxygen-derived free radicals, and thromboxane moderate the altered lung permeability.\r"

While the dangers of hyperoxia to the fetus have been demonstrated in animal models, careful review of animal studies and human clinical experience indicates that the short duration of hyperoxic exposure attained during HBO therapy for CO poisoning can be tolerated by the fetus in all stages of pregnancy and reduces the risk of death or deformity to the mother and fetus.

  ".W": "Three hundred fifteen smokers who attended a family practice clinic and wished to quit smoking were assigned in a random, double-blind manner to receive either nicotine (2 mg) or placebo gum. Smokers initially received brief advice from a physician and nurse, a slide presentation and written materials (29 to 35 minutes), and a single follow-up visit (12 to 20 minutes) one week after cessation. After corrections for marital status and income, 10% of those who received nicotine gum and 7% of those who received placebo gum reported continuous abstinence for 11 months and passed observer and biochemical verification (this difference was not statistically significant). We conclude that, when used in a nonselected group of smokers along with a brief intervention in a general medical practice, the pharmacologic effects of nicotine gum to increase cessation are either small or nonexistent.\r"

In all of the three lymph node groups, in the paracortex, helper/inducer T cells were more numerous than suppressor/cytotoxic T cells. The number of whole T cells in the paracortex diminished with increasing proximity to the primary tumor. In the three lymph node groups, no significant difference was found regarding the ratio of the cell number among suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. Lymphocytes in the paracortex of lymph node had a positive correlation to lymphocytes in the peritumoral stroma and intratumoral fields. These data neither suggest the presence of a powerful immunological reaction in the mesocolic lymph node nor support the concept of conservation of uninvolved regional lymph nodes in the surgery of the colorectal cancer.\r"

SCLC cells (N417, H526, H209) were synchronized by double thymidine block and assessed by DNA content with flow cytometry, and the period for the maximal accumulation of cells in S, G1, or G2-M phase was determined. Cells in different cell cycle phases were exposed to 0.9% NaCl, BLM, or 111In-BLMC for 1 hour and observed for colony formation. The survival of H526 cells treated with 111In-BLMC was 71% (for enriched S phase), 46% (G1), and 31% (G2-M). For N417 cells, it was 25% (S), 20% (G1), and 8% (G2-M) for 111In-BLMC and 18% (S), 33% (G1), and 10% (G2-M) for BLM.

The plasma insulin concentration 30 min after glucose ingestion was lower in the diabetic patients than in matched controls for both non-obese (11-83 pmol/l vs 136-297 pmol/l, p less than 0.01) and obese subjects (23-119 pmol/l vs 137-378 pmol/l, p less than 0.01). By means of another two-site immunoradiometric assay, the basal intact proinsulin level was found to be higher in the NIDDM patients than in the controls for both non-obese (7.1 [SEM 1.2] pmol/l vs 2.4 [0.4] pmol/l, p less than 0.01) and obese subjects (14.4 [2.2] pmol/l vs 5.9 [1.9] pmol/l, p less than 0.01). The basal level of 32-33 split proinsulin was also raised in NIDDM. Previous failure to show clear separation between normal and NIDDM insulin responses was probably due to the high concentrations of proinsulin-like molecules in the plasma of NIDDM patients. These substances cross-react as insulin in most, if not all, insulin radioimmunoassays but have very little biological insulin-like activity. It is therefore now possible and necessary to designate most NIDDM patients as insulin deficient.\r"

No survival advantage was observed with this therapy as compared with no postoperative therapy during four years of follow-up (87 percent vs. 86 percent; P = 0.8). However, there was a significant prolongation of disease-free survival among women who received this therapy as compared with those who did not (80 percent vs. 71 percent; P = 0.003). An advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old and those greater than or equal to 50. At four years, treatment failure was reduced by 24 percent in the younger group and by 50 percent in the older group. The rates of both local and regional and distant metastases were decreased. These benefits, achieved without the use of an alkylating agent, were associated with tolerable side effects. Multivariate analysis testing for potential interactions failed to identify subgroups of patients who did not benefit from the therapy. These results, although promising, do not obviate the need for additional trials to evaluate potentially better regimens of therapy, but they do suggest that sequential methotrexate-fluorouracil should be used in the control arm in such studies. Their use is also justified for the treatment of patients who refuse to participate in clinical trials, provided the patients meet the eligibility criteria of the present study. Since women with tumors too small for conventional analysis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor concentrations were not included in this study, we do not recommend systemic treatment for them outside of a clinical trial.\r"

This advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old (P = 0.0005) and those greater than or equal to 50 (P = 0.0008), particularly in the former, among whom the rate of treatment failure was reduced by 44 percent. Multivariate analysis indicated that all subgroups of patients benefited. Tamoxifen significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure at local and distant sites, tumors in the opposite breast, and the incidence of tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and breast irradiation. The benefit was attained with a low incidence of clinically appreciable toxic effects. The magnitude of the improvement obtained does not preclude the need for future trials in which patients given tamoxifen could serve as the control group in an evaluation of potentially better therapies. Tamoxifen treatment is justified in patients who meet the eligibility criteria of the present study and who refuse to participate in those trials. Since patients with tumors too small for conventional analysis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor concentrations were not eligible for this study, no information is available to indicate that such patients should receive tamoxifen.\r"

  ".W": "A period of early, intensive insulin treatment is thought to improve subsequent beta-cell function in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). To study this hypothesis, we randomly assigned adolescents with newly diagnosed IDDM to receive either conventional treatment (n = 14) (NPH insulin, 1 U per kilogram of body weight per day, in two divided doses) or an experimental treatment (n = 12) (a two-week hospitalization with maintenance of blood glucose levels between 3.3 and 4.4 mmol per liter by continuous insulin infusion delivered by an external artificial pancreas [Biostator]). During the two-week intervention, the experimental-therapy group received four times more insulin than the conventionally treated group, and their endogenous insulin secretion was more completely suppressed, as evidenced by a urinary C-peptide excretion rate one seventh that of the conventionally treated group. After the first two weeks, both groups were treated similarly and received similar amounts of insulin. At one year, the mean (+/- SEM) plasma level of C peptide was significantly higher after mixed-meal stimulation in the experimental-therapy group than in the conventionally treated group (0.51 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.06; P less than 0.01). The experimental-therapy group also had better metabolic control, as evidenced by lower glycohemoglobin values (7.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.8 +/- 1.2 percent; P less than 0.01). We conclude that suppression of endogenous insulin by intensive, continuous insulin treatment during the first two weeks after the diagnosis of IDDM may improve beta-cell function during the subsequent year.\r"
