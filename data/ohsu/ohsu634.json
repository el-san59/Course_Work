This study was performed to investigate the changes in Substance P (SP) and Vasoactive-Intestinal Peptide (VIP), found in the dorsal root ganglion, following discography in normal and abnormal canine lumber intervertebral discs. The data from this study suggest that dorsal root ganglion SP and VIP are indirectly affected by manipulations of the intervertebral disc. It may be that various neurochemical changes within the intervertebral disc are expressed by sensitized (injured) annular nociceptors, and in part modulated by the dorsal root ganglion. Therefore, the concomitant pain sometimes associated with an abnormal discogram image may in part be related to the chemical environment within the intervertebral disc and the sensitized state of its annular nociceptors.\r"

The CT/discograms were classified by discographic pain response, the amount of degeneration and annular disruption. Eighty-two percent of DH patients, 80% of DD, 56% of LS, and 59% of LRS patients had both positive discographic pain provocation and moderate or severe disc deterioration.

Highly significant (P = 0.0001) relationships were found within the biomechanical parameters of trauma as well as between the trauma and the functional parameters at 4 weeks after injury.

An inter-rater agreement trial was undertaken to estimate the reliability of measuring these spinal parameters. Two orthopaedic surgeons and two trained technicians from a scoliosis clinic independently read 30 anteroposterior roentgenograms of AIS patients. Skeletal maturity was assessed using the six-point Risser sign scale, and spinal curvature was measured using the method of Cobb. Excellent agreement was observed in evaluating Risser signs (Kappa = 0.8) and primary Cobb angles (intra-class correlation coefficient, Rho = 0.98). The standard deviation of inter-observer error in measuring primary Cobb angles was 2.5 degrees, and the intra-reader error, based on one observer's reassessments of 15 films, was 1.9 degrees. Inter-rater agreement for assessing secondary Cobb angles was much lower (Rho = 0.52) because small curves (less than 20 degrees) were often not noticed. Differences in agreement between surgeons and technicians were relatively minor. These results indicate that personnel trained at this clinic are able to assess these spinal parameters reliably.\r"

Charts of 636 patients were reviewed for the presence or absence of pain. Curve measurements and the occurrence of rotatory olisthesis were noted. Rotatory olisthesis was statistically unrelated to the occurrence of pain associated with idiopathic scoliosis. It was significantly associated with increasing age and curve magnitude. Lumbar curves with rotatory olisthesis were more likely to be associated with radicular pain.\r"

The posterior approach was used in these patients instead of an anterior one because of translocation (4), three-column disease (16), three or more vertebral bodies involved (13), disease at two separate locations (2), and inability to tolerate an anterior approach (3). All patients had maintenance of spinal alignment for the length of follow-up or until their ultimate demise. Good pain relief was achieved in 19 of 25 patients. Six of ten patients with significant paresis recovered. Four patients developed recurrent spinal cord compression within 12 months postoperative from regrowth of tumor that was not controlled by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Resistance to flexion of the L4-L5 joint was simulated using various ligament cross-sectional areas, and combined loading modes of compression coupled with bending in an attempt to understand physiologic conditions that may occur during activities such as lifting. Results suggest that the interspinous ligament sustains the greatest stress during flexion at L4-L5, is the dominant component in resistance to flexion, and also creates large shear components that must be resisted by the facet complex. Simulated compressive loads of 6300 N were noted to allow an additional 2 degrees of flexion at the joint.\r"

Of the families in Group I and Group II, 35 and 37%, respectively, had at least one member with a history of discogenic back pain and 5 and 10%, respectively, had one or two members who had undergone disc surgery. Of the asymptomatic subjects in Group III, only 12% had at least one or more affected relatives and 1% had a relative who had undergone disc surgery; of the affected families, 41% had two or more members with a history of back pain. The proportion of symptomatic relatives in the affected families was higher among sedentary workers and motor vehicle drivers than among heavy or light manual workers. An immunogenetic study comparing the frequencies of HLA-A, B, and C antigens in 39 patients who had undergone lumbar disc surgery with those in 60 asymptomatic individuals showed no significant differences between the two groups. This study indicates that there is a strong familial predisposition to discogenic low-back pain, and suggests that the etiology of degenerative disc disease is related to both genetic factors, not linked to the HLA antigen system, and environmental factors.\r"

Only nine patients (16.7%) had the diagnosis confirmed, significantly lower than most published results. An anatomic study performed suggests that extravasation into the epidural space occurs following rupture of the joint capsule. This provides an explanation by which good therapeutic results can be obtained if large volumes of therapeutic agent are used.\r"

Of these, 255 (70%) still complained of back pain, and 83 (23%) of this group complained of constant heavy pain; 172 patients (45%) have a residual sciatica; 131 (35%) are still under some kind of treatment; 47 (14%) patients are receiving a disability pension. Repeat operations were performed in 17%. Based on the criteria given by Spine Update 1984 as related to justified or unjustified indication there was no statistical difference in long-term results concerning the above-mentioned criteria of success. The so-called justified indication for disc herniation neurosurgery does not necessarily imply a good long-term result. In the preoperative investigation, not only symptoms and neurological signs, but also the socially and personally defined career of the illness are of importance. The patients with complaints, mainly those receiving a pension, are psychologically conspicuous and show more psychopathological features as monitored by MMPI than the patients without complaints after surgery. Psychological assessment should increasingly be used in the preoperative evaluation, especially in patients who do not present an absolute indication for neurosurgical intervention.\r"

Independent from the preoperative low-back pain condition and the immediate postoperative results, the operated patients showed, several years after the operation, traceable differences in several psychosocial factors according to the socially and personally defined illness career and its stages. The difference is particularly strong between the patients without complaints and the pensioned patients. The patients with complaints, mainly those receiving a pension, showed more psychopathological features as monitored on MMPI than the patients without complaints. They also reported substantially less satisfactory occupational, family and social life than the patients considered to be complaint-free. Finally, they also differed in their modes of coping with their back problems.\r"

The clinical status of patients was assessed at 6 weeks and at 6 months, and evaluation was made from responses of the patients to a questionnaire at 1 year. Evaluation at 1 year demonstrated that the results of chemonucleolysis were successful for 181 patients (84.6%). Of the 172 patients who received no worker's compensation, the procedure was successful for 90.7%. Of 42 with worker's compensation, the success rate was 59.5%. After chemonucleolysis, most patients showed neurologic improvement. Data comparing neurologic symptoms and signs between compensation and noncompensation patients are presented. This is the first report of objective data after chemonucleolysis in these two groups. A discussion on the morbidity and mortality of chemonucleolysis is included, along with a comparison of cost between chemonucleolysis and laminectomy.\r"

The in vitro production of plasminogen activator by alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage was studied in 22 normal subjects and 28 patients with interstitial lung disease to determine whether plasminogen activator is produced by normal alveolar macrophages and whether this is increased in patients with interstitial lung disease. Plasminogen activator activity, measured with an iodine-125 labelled fibrin release assay, was found to be dependent on time, effector cell numbers, and plasminogen concentration. Plasminogen activator production by alveolar macrophages from 14 normal non-smokers and eight normal smokers was similar and the mean value was 0.78 (SEM 0.16) urokinase (UK) units x 10(-8)/cell/hour. Alveolar macrophages from the seven patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and six patients with histiocytosis-X produced more plasminogen activator (1.89 (0.25) and 4.54 (1.3) x 10(-8) UK units/cell/hour respectively) than macrophages from normal subjects (p less than 0.05), whereas those from 15 patients with sarcoidosis did not (1.09 (0.2) x 10(-8) UK units/cell/hour). Exposure of normal alveolar macrophages to immune complexes enhanced plasminogen activator production to 2.07 (0.27) x 10(-8) UK units/cell/hour, whereas exposure to products of activated T cells and to purified gamma interferon reduced plasminogen activator production (to 0.38 (0.11) and 0.62 (0.11) x 10(-8) UK units/cell/hour respectively). These studies show that plasminogen activator is produced by normal human alveolar macrophages and that its production is increased in patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and histiocytosis-X.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of the bronchoalveolar response was assessed in rats exposed, at equal airborne mass concentration (10 mg/m3), to titanium dioxide--a non-pathogenic dust--and the two pathogenic mineral dusts quartz and chrysotile asbestos. Rats were killed at intervals over a 75 day exposure period and groups of rats exposed for 32 and 75 days after recovery for two months. Bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out and the lavage fluid characterised for cellular content, macrophage activation, and concentrations of free total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Inhalation exposure to the two pathogenic dusts resulted in an increased number of leucocytes, macrophage activation, and increased levels of free enzymes and total protein. The pattern and magnitude of the responses to quartz and chrysotile differed. Chrysotile caused less inflammation than quartz, and the main cellular response peaked around the middle of the period of dust exposure whereas the highest levels of enzymes occurred towards the end. The difference in timing suggests that macrophages were not available for lavage towards the end of the exposure, owing to their playing a part possibly in deposition of granulation tissue. Quartz caused a greater cellular and enzyme response than chrysotile, particularly towards the end of the dust exposure phase. There was a noticeable progression of inflammation in the quartz exposed groups left to recover for two months, but not in the chrysotile recovery groups.\r"

A questionnaire was completed before each of 100 biopsies (in 97 patients) to determine the clinician's pretest diagnosis and the likelihood of malignancy. The latter estimates were combined with the previously established sensitivity (71%) and specificity (100%) of the procedure for diagnosing malignancy in the unit to allow calculation in each case of the change in certainty of malignancy as a result of the investigation. Among the 100 biopsies there were 73 true positive and 13 true negative results. There were no false positive results but there were 14 false negatives (cases where malignancy was later proved but where the biopsy did not show unequivocal evidence of malignancy). Among the 27 negative biopsy results the clinician had estimated the likelihood of malignancy as 80% or more in 13 cases. In 11 of these 13 patients the eventual diagnosis proved to be a malignant tumour; on the other hand, six of the 10 patients given a less than 50% chance of malignancy had a benign outcome. A positive biopsy result was therefore quantitively of greatest value when the prior estimate of malignancy was low. In the case of the false negative results the prior probability of malignancy was usually sufficiently high to merit further investigation. It is estimated that the procedure led to the avoidance of thoracotomy in up to 14 of 97 patients.\r"

Thoracic gas volume (TGV) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) were measured plethysmographically and maximum forced expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) was derived from the partial expiratory flow-volume curve. At the time of the initial evaluation respiratory function was correlated with the clinical condition of the infants but not with age. There was a good correlation between sGaw and VmaxFRC when both were expressed as percentages of the predicted normal values. On the basis of the normal range for sGaw the infants were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 9), who had normal sGaw, were younger and had a lower clinical score and normal VmaxFRC and TGV values. Group B (n = 19), who had low sGaw, had increased TGV and decreased VmaxFRC. There was no correlation with age for any measure of lung function for the population as a whole. Repeat testing was undertaken at intervals in 17 representative infants. In most of these infants the relation between sGaw and VmaxFRC was maintained; there was no evidence that VmaxFRC was affected before sGaw. There was no functional evidence that the earliest changes in cystic fibrosis occur in small airways, as reflected by changes in VmaxFRC in infancy.\r"

To elucidate the question of whether products of mast cells affect the proliferative behaviour of structural cells in the lung and thereby contribute to fibrogenesis, the effect of histamine, a prominent mast cell derived mediator, on the in vitro proliferation of primary cultures of normal adult human lung fibroblasts was studied. Histamine enhanced fibroblast proliferation in a dose dependent manner, with an optimum effect at a physiological concentration of 10(-7) mol/l. This effect occurred when cells were exposed to histamine at restricted times during cell growth and was shown to depend in part on the stage of the cell cycle reached by the fibroblasts. The histamine induced proliferation was mediated through an H2 histamine receptor on the fibroblast, being inhibited by cimetidine, an H2 antagonist, and not by pyrilamine maleate, an antagonist of the H1 receptor. Mast cell products such as histamine may interact with and promote the increased fibroblast proliferation found in pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

Subjects were studied 22-35 years after their first pneumothorax with measurement of static and dynamic lung volumes. Eighty patients had been treated with talc pleurodesis and 34 with simple pleural drainage. At the follow up examination 17 had died from what appear to be unrelated causes and two had emigrated. Of the remainder, 75 participated fully in the study, 14 completed a postal questionnaire, and six failed to respond. The group treated with talc poudrage showed a mild restrictive impairment of lung function with a mean total lung capacity (TLC) of 89% predicted. In subjects treated with simple drainage mean TLC was 96% predicted. One subject treated with talc poudrage had extensive pleural calcification and a substantial reduction in lung function (TLC 58% predicted) with some evidence of lung fibrosis. None of the subjects had developed a mesothelioma. We conclude that, although talc poudrage may cause a mild restrictive impairment of lung function and pleural thickening on the chest radiograph, the long term outlook is good.\r"

To examine this possibility, whole body irradiation, bleomycin injections, and exposure to hyperoxia were used to induce various types of lung damage in mice. The morphology of the lung and the cellular and protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were used to assess injury. Collagen breakdown was assessed from the hydroxyproline concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. When lung cell injury was observed, protein leaked in to alveoli and hydroxyproline was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. An increase in hydroxyproline followed endothelial damage by irradiation and was greatly increased when type 1 epithelial cell necrosis also occurred after bleomycin injection or hyperoxia. Maximal concentrations of hydroxyproline occurred in mice showing respiratory distress after six days of hyperoxia. Concentrations returned to zero during the subsequent phases of cell regeneration and fibrosis seen after bleomycin injection and irradiation. There was little change in the cellular components of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at any time. The results indicate that collagen breakdown occurs during acute lung injury and can be quantified in terms of the hydroxyproline concentration in lavage fluid. Such a change in the extracellular matrix might influence the subsequent division and differentiation of regenerating cells during repair.\r"

Significant increases were noted in systemic systolic and diastolic blood pressures concomitant with significant increases in total systemic vascular resistance and systemic arteriolar resistance. Pulmonary arterial pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance increased as well. Mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure rose modestly during smoking. Finally, the double product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, increased considerably during the smoking and postsmoking periods.

The absolute number and percentage of neutrophils recoverable by BAL increased significantly at 24 hours after infusion of endotoxin. Alveolar macrophages isolated from the BAL of sheep after endotoxemia produced a substance that is chemotactic for neutrophils, a response that is also maximal 24 hours after endotoxin infusion. We conclude that endotoxemia causes migration of neutrophils into lung air spaces and that this response may result from in vivo production of a chemotactic factor(s) by activated alveolar macrophages.\r"

We, therefore, studied cytochrome P450 in addition to the level of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme catabolism, and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis, in the remnant liver and intact kidneys of rats after two-thirds hepatectomy. The level of hepatic heme oxygenase was elevated threefold in partially hepatectomized rats as compared to sham-operated rats, while ALA synthase was decreased by 40%. This was reflected in decreased hepatic cytochrome P450 content, ie, from 0.689 +/- 0.175 nmole/mg to 0.505 +/- 0.089 nmole/mg protein and associated decreased drug metabolizing enzymes: aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, and benzphetamine N-demethylase, by 40%, 40%, and 47%, respectively.

Renal cytochrome P450, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, and benzphetamine N-demethylase were increased after partial hepatectomy by 84%, 360%, 165% and 406%, respectively. These data indicate that partial hepatectomy decreases liver cytochrome P450 levels by inducing heme oxygenase and inhibiting ALA synthase activities. In this situation the kidney plays a substitutive role in metabolizing endogenous substrates oxygenated by cytochrome P450 isozymes.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the use of microbiologic reports by physicians in prescribing antimicrobial agents in a community hospital setting. Patients were identified by daily review of all blood, urine, and sputum cultures that grew pathogen(s) during a 7-week period. Appropriateness of antibiotic therapy was based on results of antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolated pathogen(s). The physician response to culture results was evaluated on changes made in antimicrobial therapy. Seventy-one patients with 73 cultures (infections) were identified; 70% of the infections were community acquired. The frequency of each infection during the study period was: bacteremia (N = 12), pneumonia (N = 18), definite urinary tract infection (N = 26) and probable urinary tract infection (N = 17). Initial treatment was appropriate in 49 of 73 (67%) episodes; the organism(s) isolated were resistant to initial therapy in 24 of 85 (33%) episodes. After culture results were available, 34 of 73 (47%) regimens were changed, but only 50% of the changes were considered appropriate. Overall, there was no significant difference in the proportion of all treatment regimens considered appropriate before (67%) and after (56%) culture results were known. We conclude that results of cultures and antibiotic susceptibility data had little influence on appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in the hospital setting.\r"

We found a statistically significant diminution of cholinergic muscarinic and somatostatin binding sites in mucosa taken from the dilated part of the jejunum, compared with those taken from the normal part. Tunica muscularis of the dilated part of the jejunum contained a significantly higher concentration of peripheral cholinergic muscarinic binding sites (M2) than the normal part did, whereas concentration of M1 cholinergic muscarinic and somatostatin binding sites was similar in both examined parts. These results indicate that IIP-syndrome may be related to alterations in cholinergic muscarinic binding sites in the tunica muscularis of the intestine.\r"

Twenty-eight patients were allocated randomly to either general anaesthesia with retrobulbar block or general anaesthesia alone. The anaesthetist involved was blinded as to whether a retrobulbar block was performed or not. Significantly fewer patients in the general anaesthesia plus block group complained of postoperative pain than patients in the general anaesthesia group (21.4% as compared with 64.3%, p less than 0.05). Those who received general anaesthesia plus block recovered significantly more rapidly than those receiving general anaesthesia alone. The time to opening of eyes on command (p less than 0.05), telling the correct date of birth (p less than 0.01), reaching a full recovery score (p less than 0.005) and performing a simple motor task (p less than 0.025) was shorter in patients with general anaesthesia plus block.

Severe cerebral ischaemic damage was sustained during this episode and the patient died 4 days later. This fatal reaction was shown to be anaphylactic in origin; the causative agent was suxamethonium. High levels of IgE antibodies specific to the quaternary ammonium group (two of which are present in suxamethonium) were detected by the radioallergosorbent test. Results of the leucocyte histamine release test were less clear, partly as a result of steroid treatment. The two most relevant points were the absence of a history of previous anaesthesia, and involvement of the heart as the principal target of the reaction. This unfortunate and extreme case indicates the necessity for allergy testing (screening) before anaesthesia, and the need for organisation and funding of this procedure, if these fatal or near-fatal reactions are to be prevented. It is a timely reminder that action should be taken, since neuromuscular blockers have been confirmed as the most common culprits, and that specific tests for IgE antibodies are now available against haptenic groups generally common to all neuromuscular blockers.\r"

The plasma atracurium and laudanosine concentrations were 1.5 micrograms/ml and 0.985 micrograms/ml respectively. Subsequently there was an exponential decline in the serum laudanosine concentration which had decreased to 0.014 micrograms/ml 24 hours later.

Fifty-six children became significantly hypoxaemic (oxygen saturation less than 90%) at some stage. Hypoxaemia occurred most frequently after termination of anaesthesia (immediate postoperative period) and then later in the recovery ward when the children began to wake up (post-waking period). The administration of 100% oxygen at the end of anaesthesia had no effect on the incidence of early hypoxaemia which was greatest in children whose trachea had been intubated. Late hypoxaemia was associated most commonly with crying and breath-holding and was reduced significantly by supplemental oxygen. The oxygen saturation of children on return to the ward was significantly lower than the pre-operative value (p less than 0.001).\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the effects of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) on the ground reaction forces, the position of the center of pressure, and the timing of stance phase events during walking in 18 healthy volunteers between the ages of 19 and 38 years. The magnitude and direction of the ground reaction forces and the locus of the center of pressure were recorded every one-sixtieth of a second during free-speed ambulation. The horizontal force components of the ground reaction force were plotted vectorially, and the vertical force component was displayed by its magnitude expressed in percentage body weight. All this information was superimposed on the subject's footprint and statistically analyzed, comparing right to left, narrow to wide, and ipsilateral to contralateral use of an AFO. The results showed a significant reduction in the mean duration of the stance phase of 4.83% (p less than 0.05) with the AFO. This reduction was due primarily to the significant reduction during midstance of 7% (p less than 0.025), which was more pronounced with the use of the wide AFO. Using an AFO also resulted in a mean increase of 20% (p less than 0.05) in the vertical force magnitude at the end of push-off. With the use of an AFO, there was a shift of the point of impact at heel strike to a more posterior location and a shift of the trajectory of the center of pressure to a more lateral position throughout the stance phase. These changes should be kept in mind when prescribing an ankle-foot orthosis.\r"

The test consisted of a series of unilateral or bilateral lights on a semicircular array to which the subject responded by pushing a button. A computer controlled the sequence of stimuli and stored the responses. Results of the computer test were compared to conventional occupational therapy and beside clinical tests. Extinction was present in 16 subjects on the computerized test, and in 11 on the clinical test. Neglect was present in 13 subjects on the computerized test, in seven subjects on the occupational therapy test, and in five subjects on the clinical test. The computerized test was more sensitive than the other tests. On both computerized and clinical testing, all subjects with left-sided neglect also had left-sided extinction, but not all subjects with extinction had neglect. Neglect may represent a more severe manifestation of an underlying perceptual defect that produces both neglect and extinction.\r"

Pretreatment data were obtained at an initial evaluation, and posttreatment data were obtained at the most recent follow-up contact, usually at 12 months after treatment. Treatment outcome was assessed on the basis of eight quantitative measures: pain ratings; health care utilization; activity tolerance; daily \"up time\"; hours per week spent in paid employment, housework, volunteer work, or school; medication intake; SCL-90R somatization, depression, and anxiety scores; and an overall summary measure. Pretreatment data indicated that older and younger groups were similar on both demographic variables and clinical status. There was a larger percentage of women in the older group. The older patients were initially somewhat more impaired than the younger ones, with nearly four times the rate of health care utilization and almost two times higher medication intake. Both groups improved significantly from pretreatment to posttreatment on most of the eight measures. Older patients showed a greater decrease in health care utilization. Women and men did not respond differentially to treatment. The data indicated that geriatric patients can benefit from chronic pain rehabilitation programs at least as much as, if not more than, younger patients.\r"

Compensation patients were younger and less likely to be female; they also tended to report fewer surgeries, shorter pain durations, and more vocational and sexual disability. Finally, they perceived their medical conditions to be more severe than had been diagnosed by physicians. The groups did not seem to differ in severity of pain or psychologic distress. These data are consistent with studies indicating that compensation patients are not \"symptom magnifiers,\" although the data do indicate that the life disruptions reported by these patients may be greater than those reported by patients not involved in compensation systems.\r"

The subjects were put on five weeks of strict horizontal bed rest. They were allowed to sit up for bowel movements only; however, no lower extremity weight-bearing was allowed. During bed rest, the subjects were required to ingest a fixed nutritionally adequate diet. Data for muscle torque were obtained using a Cybex II dynamometer, Upper Body Exercise Table (UBXT), and a data analysis computer (HUMAC). The subjects were tested on Cybex at the speed of 60 degrees/sec during the week before starting bed rest and the day after starting reambulation. The muscle groups tested were soleus, gastrocnemius-soleus, dorsiflexors, knee flexors, knee extensors, elbow flexors, and elbow extensors. The torque in all groups but elbow extensors was reduced by 24%, 26%, 8%, 8%, 19%, and 7%, respectively. Student's t-test for paired means demonstrated significant loss of torque in all muscle groups except elbow extensors (p less than 0.05). The results of this study suggest that a strengthening exercise program should be administered to these patients while they are on bed rest, and that the earliest possible attempt should be made to ambulate patients after prolonged bed rest to minimize the loss of muscle torque.\r"

  ".W": "Modified aerobic exercise may have a role in the management of patients with symptoms of postpolio syndrome by improving biomechanical efficiency, alleviating secondary cardiorespiratory and muscular deconditioning, and avoiding some risks associated with traditional strengthening exercises. The effects of a walking program on the functional capacity of patients with symptoms of postpolio syndrome were studied. Three patients participated in full oxygen consumption studies during submaximal treadmill exercise tests before and after an eight-week period. Two patients participated in an eight-week program designed to prolong walking duration while maintaining perceived exertion and discomfort/pain at minimal levels. A third patient was tested before and after eight weeks but did not receive training. The untrained patient showed some reduction in the retest compared with the initial test at all workloads with respect to oxygen consumption, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure, but ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort/pain were comparable for the two tests. Reductions in metabolic responses during the retest could be explained by the effect of habituation to the testing situation. In contrast, the trained patients showed relatively marked reductions in both metabolic and subjective responses after training. These results suggest that patients with symptoms of postpolio syndrome can increase their functional work capacity after a modified aerobic walking program. This improvement reflects improved biomechanical efficiency and possible training effects at the cardiorespiratory and muscular levels. Further research is needed to elucidate the role and interactions of these mechanisms in improving the functional work capacity of patients with chronic neuromuscular dysfunction.\r"

Participants were interviewed by telephone. Sensation-seeking was assessed by the Disinhibition (Dis) and Boredom Susceptibility (BS) subscales of Zuckerman's Sensation-Seeking Scale (SSS, Form V). Although an earlier study found no difference on the SSS between a group of SCI patients and published norms, modest but statistically significant differences were found between SCI subjects and control subjects with respect to both subscales and the combined SSS score. The mean difference on the latter was 1.6 units on a scale of 0-20 (t = 4.11, p = .0001). Compared to patients scoring below the tenth percentile on the SSS, those scoring above the 90th percentile were significantly younger at the time of SCI, more likely to report an arrest before their SCI, and more likely to be using drugs or alcohol at the time of SCI.\r"

Only 15 cases involving IT MTX have been documented and even fewer with IT Ara-C. Three patients were studied who developed permanent or ascending myelopathy from treatment of their leukemia or rhabdomyosarcoma with IT chemotherapy. The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 62 years. Two of the three patients had electromyographic examinations. These revealed a primary motor neuron degeneration or a polyradiculopathy, superimposed on a mild axonal peripheral neuropathy associated with vincristine therapy. This is consistent with other electromyographic studies. Two of the patients showed an elevation of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein before development of paraplegia; one also showed a rise in myelin basic protein associated with his myelopathy. Neuropathologic findings suggest demyelination as the primary process leading to myelopathy. Increasing evidence has shown that total CSF protein, or more specifically, the myelin basic protein, may be elevated before development of paraplegia. Routine serial testing of the CSF for total protein could be used as a screening test during therapy.\r"

There were eight subjects in each group: five received active drug and three received placebo; each subject was given only one dose. All subjects completed the study, and lomefloxacin was well tolerated at all doses. No drug crystals were noted in the urine at 3 and 6 h after the dose. The mean maximum concentration in serum (Cmax) ranged from 1.11 to 7.46 micrograms/ml for the 100- to 800-mg doses, respectively, and the AUC increased proportionally with the dose. The mean time to Cmax (Tmax) values averaged 64.8 +/- 28.8 min. The elimination half-life and plasma clearance averaged 7.7 +/- 0.52 h and 259 +/- 37 ml/min, respectively. Mean concentrations in urine were highest during the first 4 h after the dose and ranged from 104 to 713 micrograms/ml following the 100- and 800-mg doses, respectively. Concentrations above 20 micrograms/ml in urine were observed in most subjects over 24 h at the three lower doses and averaged over 120 micrograms/ml during the 12- to 24-h interval at the 400-mg dose, thus supporting once-per-day dosing. Excretion rates from urine and the cumulative amount excreted increased in a dose-related fashion. Renal clearance decreased moderately at the higher doses. Thus, lomefloxacin was well tolerated, and dose proportionality was demonstrated by most pharmacokinetic parameters. The 400-mg dose produced concentrations in plasma and urine above the MIC for susceptible pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous paper, we showed that during a long-term, moderate restriction in sodium intake, sympathetic nervous system activity was only transiently stimulated, whereas a sustained rise of plasma renin activity occurred. However, the contribution from stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis during a low-salt diet is still unclear. To investigate this issue, in eight normal subjects blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, renin activity, and aldosterone were measured during normal sodium intake (150 mEq/d), after converting-enzyme inhibition (enalapril 20 mg/d po), and during one month of sodium intake restriction (50 mEq/d) associated with chronic inhibition of converting-enzyme (CEI). During a low-salt diet with CEI, plasma renin activity rose significantly as a result of CEI. In addition, even in the presence of a marked and sustained increase in plasma norepinephrine and in upright heart rate, a decrease in blood pressure was observed in all the measurements performed during the course of the study as compared to the control values. Our findings support the hypothesis that renin-angiotensin system activation plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis during a low-salt diet. In fact, in the presence of an effective blockade of angiotensin II formation, blood pressure is decreased, despite the concurrent, sustained stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

Blood pressure correlated negatively with serum phosphate (P less than 0.001) and positively with plasma epinephrine (P less than 0.01) and heart rate (P less than 0.01). Serum phosphate was significantly lowered during infusion of epinephrine, increasing arterial plasma epinephrine within the lower pathophysiological range corresponding to arousal reactions. Serum concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone were unchanged. Thus, hypophosphatemia in patients with mild essential hypertension appears to be inversely related to sympathetic adrenal tone and may be caused by increased plasma epinephrine within pathophysiologic arterial concentrations.\r"

There was a good correlation (p less than 0.001) between the presence of IgA rheumatoid factor and the presence as well as levels of IgG immune complexes, but not between levels of IgA rheumatoid factor and other clinical or immunological parameters. However, higher levels of serum IgA were found in the subgroup of patients with constantly positive IgA rheumatoid factor. Using aggregated human IgG, we could not demonstrate antiglobulin activity in renal biopsy specimens from 36 patients. These results suggest that IgA rheumatoid factor does not play a primary role in renal damage in IgA nephropathy, but could simply reflect a response to IgG immune complexes in a disorder characterized by abnormalities of IgA production. Nevertheless, the presence of circulating IgA rheumatoid factor in a substantial proportion of patients, especially in those with features of polyclonal IgA activation, provides additional evidence for a general perturbation of IgA metabolism in this disease and could represent an antigen-specific system with which to study regulation of IgA synthesis.\r"

The patients were divided into 4 groups. Groups 1 and 2 were intravenously given cefotiam (5 patients) and cefsulodin (4 patients), respectively. Groups 3 and 4 (5 patients each) were given cefsulodin intraperitoneally. Group 3 did not have peritonitis, while the patients in Group 4 were studied during peritonitis. Blood and dialysate samples were obtained at selected times during the 5-hour dwell and, for plasma, until 24 hours after drug administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data showed that only 6.0 and 8.7% of the intravenous doses of cefotiam and cefsulodin, respectively, were recovered in the dialysate at the end of the dwell. The net amounts of cefsulodin lost from the dialysate after intraperitoneal administration were 81 and 84%, in Groups 3 and 4 respectively. The peritoneal transfer clearances (using a unidirectional clearance model), calculated after intravenous (17 +/- 10 ml/min, Group 2) and intraperitoneal (17 +/- 5 ml/min, Group 3) administrations were the same. Mass balance of cefsulodin in the body and in the dialysate after intraperitoneal administration indicated that a significant amount (40%, Group 3) of the dose is unaccounted for. One explanation for this imbalance is retention of the drug in the peritoneal lining. This hypothesis is supported by the retention being lower in the peritonitis patients (less than 20%, Group 4), for whom the linings are expected to be partially eroded.\r"

Fourteen children, four of whom had anuric, four oliguric and six non oliguric acute renal failure were treated with intravenous fluids and high dose intravenous furosemide therapy. Polyuria was induced in all, obviating the need for dialysis. We hypothesize that oligo-anuria in this syndrome may be due to the previously recognized hyperuricemia causing a urate nephropathy superimposed on the glomerulopathy thus explaining its possible amenability to fluid and diuretic therapy.\r"

The relationship was linear throughout the entire range of normal and abnormal protein excretion, an ONU rate of 1 mg/h/m2 body surface area being proportional to an EMU Up/Uc of 5 mg/mmol. Using the Coomassie Blue dye-binding method the upper limit of Up/Uc in 377 apparently healthy children and adolescents aged 3-19 years was shown to be 20 mg/mmol. Albumin/creatinine ratios (Ua/Uc) were also determined in the 377 healthy subjects, yielding a normal working upper limit of 3 mg/mmol. Although in normal individuals studied longitudinally the day-to-day variation of both Up/Uc and Ua/Uc was appreciable, all measurements remained within the cross-sectional normal range. While the determination of Ua/Uc has a role in the study of \"microproteinuria\", it is comparatively costly for routine use. The measurement of the EMU Up/Uc avoids errors and difficulties associated with timed urine collection, simplifies sample handling by the laboratory and is inexpensive. In clinical practice this is the method of choice for the quantification of proteinuria in patients with renal disease.\r"

Bioavailability of pyrazinamide was only slightly increased in patients, its dialysis extraction coefficient being 55.3%. In contrast, pyrazinoic acid has an elimination rate-dependent metabolism with a bioavailability markedly increased in patients and a dialysis extraction coefficient of 59.8%. These data may lead to recommendations of a reduction in the dosage of pyrazinamide in dialysis patients. However, administering the usual dosage of the drug at the end of each dialysis session seems preferable to the daily administration of a reduced dosage.\r"

Chosen for this study were 28 hypertensive patients and 46 normotensive subjects during an observation period of 3.84 +/- 2.17 years, which extended from the first to the last biopsy. In a comprehensive analysis, the following findings were observed: Glomerular sclerosis was analyzed semiquantitatively and estimated as \"glomerular index\" (GI). Interstitial volume (IV) was determined by the point-counting method. Mesangial electron dense deposits (MDD) and arteriolar hyaline change (HC) were also analyzed semiquantitatively. Arterial fibroelastic intimal thickening was analyzed morphometrically and estimated as the luminal \"occlusive rate\" (OR). These morphological parameters including their serial changes were compared between the hypertensives and the normotensives. The serial changes in GI and IV from the first to the last biopsy were significantly greater in the hypertensives than in the normotensives. Both OR and HC, including their serial changes, were significantly higher in the hypertensive subjects. In the study of MDD and its serial changes, no difference was apparent between the two groups. In the study of OR and HC, there was no correlation observed with GI. Our observations show that hypertension accelerates the progression of both glomerular and vascular sclerosis in case of human glomerulonephritis and suggests that this acceleration cannot only be explained by ischemia-related factors resulting from vascular sclerosis.\r"

Based on the apparent isoelectric point and molecular weights, the urinary cationic components in the urines of type I diabetic patients were superimposable to purified cationic proteins derived from human platelets. Furthermore, they also shared common antigenic components as evidenced by the ability of a goat anti-human platelet-derived cationic protein serum to immunoprecipitate the 45 kD protein fraction. The latter induced vascular permeability when injected intradermally in the rabbit's skin. The occurrence of urinary cationic proteins was associated with the significant increase in albumin excretion rate (AER) in diabetic patients. No urinary cationic components were ever detected in the urines of 6 healthy subjects before, during, or after exercise. The possible pathogenetic relevance of the urinary excretion of cationic proteins in diabetic AER is discussed.\r"

All patients received a bolus dose of 1.5 g of cefuroxime intravenously and the concentrations of cefuroxime in serum and ultrafiltrate were followed during the hemofiltration period and up to 16 hours after injection of cefuroxime. During IHF the mean terminal half-life of cefuroxime was 1.6 +/- 0.3 hours compared with a terminal half-life of 21.7 +/- 5 hours after treatment. The total cefuroxime clearance was 120 +/- 22 ml/min. The hemofiltration clearance represented 86% of the total clearance and the hemofiltration process removed in average 63% of the dose. During CAVH the terminal half-life of cefuroxime was 7.9 +/- 2.2 hours. The total plasma clearance for cefuroxime was 32 +/- 7.5 ml/min where the CAVH-treatment represented only 34% of the total clearance. From these data we suggest that a full loading dose (1.5 g of cefuroxime) should be given after each intermittent hemofiltration treatment when performed every second day. In CAVH, where nonrenal clearance will influence the dosage scheme significantly, we suggest an initial dose of 1.5 g of cefuroxime to be followed by a supplementary dose of 750 mg every 20-24 h.\r"

Three patients died from myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, and renal failure, respectively. No patients required further hemostatic measures after pack removal. Perineal wound infection or delayed perineal wound healing occurred in 22 percent and abdominal wound infection in 6 percent of the patients. There were no instances of anastomotic leak, abdominal abscess, or pelvic abscess requiring laparotomy for treatment in this series. Pelvic packing is a safe, simple, and effective procedure for patients with problematic pelvic bleeding after rectal resection.\r"

Seventy-four percent of the patients had no leakage or staining and 82 percent had a deferral time of more than one hour. Nightly evacuations were significantly more common in men than in women. Leakage and short deferral time were significantly more common in patients over 40 years of age than in those under 25. Early experience with the S-pouch was encumbered by evacuation problems and ileoanal separations. Shortening of the efferent conduits and the muscle cuffs reduced these complications significantly. Postoperative continence was improved significantly after reduction of anal dilatation and preservation of the transitional zone. The length of bowel used for the double-loop reservoirs seemed to be of importance concerning frequency.\r"

The colonic mucosa was normal at endoscopic and histologic examinations (UCRN). The remaining 16 patients had normal colonic mucosa, but had an adenoma or an adenocarcinoma elsewhere in the colon. Several ultrastructural parameters were investigated, such as the number of crypts per area, the distance between the crypts, the outline of mucosal units, the number of mucous cells, the outline of absorptive cells, and the number of villi per area. Quantitative determinations of SEM structures (including measurements with an interactive digital image analyzer system; MOP 30, Zeiss Contron) were made. The results showed no significant differences between the various parameters (except for the number of crypts per area) between patients with UCRN and controls. The possibility of a total (or quasi-total) restitutio ad integrum of the colonic mucosa in certain patients with UCR is discussed. An international policy regarding the colonoscopic surveillance of patients with UCRN should be elaborated. It is suggested that the time interval between control colonoscopic biopsies in patients with UCRN should be increased substantially.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment in young children of the bioavailability of slow-release theophylline formulations is hampered by the requirement for frequent blood sampling. Calculations of bioavailability from serial serum and passively absorbed saliva samples were therefore compared in six 9- to 12-year-old asthmatic children receiving multiple doses of Theo-Dur Sprinkle every 12 hours, using Theo-Dur tablets, a previously characterized formulation, as a reference. Results indicated 85 +/- 5 percent and 82 +/- 8 percent (mean +/- SEM) relative bioavailability based on serum and salivary measurements, respectively. Correlation coefficient for serum and passively absorbed saliva bioavailabilities was 0.90. Passively absorbed saliva provides an acceptably accurate, noninvasive method for theophylline bioavailability assessment and may be a useful alternative for bioavailability studies in young children.\r"

A wide range of variation has been shown to occur with large-volume infusion devices. The intent of this investigation was to examine flow variation resulting from the use of selected small-volume syringe and mobile infusion devices and determine whether these devices have greater flow continuity than large-volume infusion pumps. Each syringe and mobile infusion device delivered iv fluid at three flow rates (1, 5, and 10 ml/h). The effusate was collected in a tared beaker and serial weights were measured every ten seconds using a computerized, gravimetric technique. Accuracy, continuity, and pattern of flow were determined for each of the syringe and mobile infusion devices. All of the devices produced accurate flow, within +/- 10 percent of the desired 5 and 10 ml/h rates. However, the actual iv flow rate ranged from 53 to 93 percent for the 1 ml/h rate. Continuity and pattern of flow resulting from each device were diverse. When compared with large-volume, microrate infusion devices, no significant differences could be observed. Therefore, no clear advantage to delivering drug solutions on a continuous basis can be expected from the use of small-volume devices. Specific infusion devices may be preferable for certain clinical applications; flow continuity data may be valuable when selecting an infusion device.\r"

We present case reports of two obese patients each requiring very large doses of phenytoin sodium (1000 mg/d) to sustain therapeutic serum concentrations and seizure control. There are very few reports in the literature regarding phenytoin pharmacokinetic changes in the obese. We can only theorize possible changes in these parameters. Further investigation in the form of controlled research trials need to be performed before final dosage recommendations can be given.\r"

We extended these studies to dogs and examined the persistence of the fetal pattern of airway epithelial permeability and ion transport in the neonatal animal. Plasma and lung liquid from fetal dogs were analyzed for Na+, K+, Cl-, and HCO3-. Only the Cl- concentration of fetal lung liquid (129 meq/l) was significantly different from that of fetal plasma (111 meq/l). Segments of trachea from fetal and neonatal (less than 1, 7-10, and 21-46 days after birth) dogs were excised and mounted in flux chambers. The transepithelial potential difference (PD) of all tissues was oriented lumen negative (9.8-14.8 mV). Under short-circuit conditions, unidirectional Na+ flows were symmetrical. Cl- was secreted, and the secretion was equivalent to short-circuit current (Isc). Cl- secretion persisted under open-circuit conditions. Lobar bronchi from 21- to 46-day neonates absorbed Na+ (1.9 mueq.cm-2.h-1), but unidirectional flows of Cl- were symmetrical. Amiloride (10(-4) M) reduced Isc of neonatal bronchi by 47% but did not affect fetal bronchi. Isoproterenol increased Isc of both fetal (33%) and neonatal (40%) bronchi. These responses suggest that fetal bronchi do not absorb Na+ but can be stimulated to secrete Cl-. We conclude that Cl- secretion by epithelium of large airways may contribute to fetal lung liquid production, but it is unlikely that the tracheal epithelium is involved in fluid absorption at birth. Whereas fetal bronchi appear to secrete Cl-, neonatal bronchi absorb Na+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fluid secretion by the fetal sheep lung is thought to be driven by secretion of Cl- by the pulmonary epithelium. We previously demonstrated Cl- secretion by tracheal epithelium excised from fetal dogs and sheep. In this study we characterized the ion transport pathways across fetal canine tracheal epithelium. The transport of Na+ and Cl- across trachea excised from fetal dogs was evaluated from transepithelial electrical properties and isotope fluxes. Under basal conditions the tissues were characterized by a lumen-negative potential difference (PD) of 11 mV and conductance of 5.2 mS/cm2. The short-circuit current (Isc) was 43 microA/cm2 (1.6 mueq.cm-2.h-1). Basal Na+ flows were symmetrical, but net Na+ absorption (1.1 mueq.cm-2.h-1) could be induced by exposure of the luminal surface to amphotericin B (10(-6) M). Bilateral replacement of Na+ reduced Isc by 85%. Replacement of submucosal Na+ or exposure to submucosal furosemide (10(-4) M) reduced net Cl- secretion by 60-70%. Luminal exposure to indomethacin (10(-6) M) induced a 50% decrease in Isc, whereas isoproterenol (10(-6) M) increased Isc by 120%. The properties of the Cl- secretory pathway across fetal dog trachea are consistent with the model proposed for Cl- secretion across adult dog trachea and other Cl- -secreting tissues (e.g., bullfrog cornea and shark rectal gland). The absence of basal Na+ absorption by fetal dog trachea probably reflects limited apical membrane Na+ permeability.\r"

Plots of airway cross-sectional area vs. lung volume, measured during inspiration and expiration, were used to determine the relative magnitude of the airways vs. parenchymal hysteresis. Airway cross-sectional area was measured by means of the acoustic reflection technique. We found that the hysteresis of the proximal part of the trachea was greater than that of the lung parenchyma, whereas the hysteresis of the distal trachea and subcarinal segments of the airways was smaller than that of the lung parenchyma. The transition zone between the proximal and the more distal airway properties occurred 8-26 cm distal to the glottis. This transition zone was reproducible in its location on repeated testing in each subject but varied among subjects. To the extent that relative hysteresis of the airways depends on bronchomotor tone, our findings suggest that the bronchomotor tone is inhomogeneous, being maximal at the proximal part of the trachea and gradually decreasing toward the more distal trachea and subcarinal airway segments.\r"

The effect of epithelium removal (by gentle rubbing) on the responsiveness of isolated canine bronchi was studied. Simultaneous recordings of mechanical and electrical activity were made in paired circumferential strips (with and without epithelium) of third-order bronchi. Changes in tension were recorded with a force transducer, and changes in membrane potential were measured with a microelectrode. The cell membrane potential and resting tension of the bronchial smooth muscle were stable over a 150-min period and were not affected by removal of the epithelium. In the presence of antagonists at muscarinic and adrenergic receptors, the resting tension and membrane potential were comparable in preparations with and without epithelium. By contrast, the anticholinesterase, echothiophate, caused depolarization in bronchi without epithelium. Exposure to high potassium induced similar levels of depolarization and contraction in tissues with and without epithelium. No significant differences in threshold for depolarization or for mechanical activation in the membrane potential-tension relationship were noted in the presence or absence of epithelium. In the presence of echothiophate, removal of the epithelium augmented the contraction of the bronchi to acetylcholine; the depolarization of the cell membrane induced by the cholinergic transmitter was significantly larger than in control tissues, even when matched contractions were compared. These observations indicate that the respiratory epithelium generates an inhibitory substance that dampens depolarization and contraction of bronchial smooth muscle caused by acetylcholine.\r"

The average increases occurred over the 2-yr follow-up period in the maximal neural activation (integrated electromyogram, IEMG; 4.2%, P = NS), maximal isometric leg-extension force (4.9%, P = NS), averaged concentric power index (4.1%, P = NS), total weight-lifting result (2.8%, P less than 0.05), and total mean fiber area (5.9%, P = NS) of the vastus lateralis muscle, respectively. The training period resulted in increases in the concentrations of serum testosterone from 19.8 +/- 5.3 to 25.1 +/- 5.2 nmol/l (P less than 0.05), luteinizing hormone (LH) from 8.6 +/- 0.8 to 9.1 +/- 0.8 U/l (P less than 0.05), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from 4.2 +/- 2.0 to 5.3 +/- 2.3 U/l (P less than 0.01), and testosterone-to-serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) ratio (P less than 0.05). The annual mean value of the second follow-up year for the serum testosterone-to-SHBG ratio correlated significantly (r = 0.84, P less than 0.01) with the individual changes during the 2nd yr in the averaged concentric power. The present results suggest that prolonged intensive strength training in elite athletes may influence the pituitary and possibly hypothalamic levels, leading to increased serum levels of testosterone. This may create more optimal conditions to utilize more intensive training leading to increased strength development.\r"

At each water temperature (Tw) male volunteers wearing only swimming trunks completed four 1-h experiments while immersed up to the neck. During one experiment, subjects remained at rest (R), and the other three performed leg exercise (LE) at three different intensities (LE-1, 2 MET; LE-2, 3 MET; LE-3, 4 MET). In water warmer than Tcw, there was no difference in metabolic rate (M) during R. The M for each work load was independent of Tw. Esophageal temperature (Tes) remained unchanged during R in water of ATtn (36 degrees C). However, Tes significantly (P less than 0.05) declined over 1 h during R at Ttn (delta Tes = -0.39 degrees C), Tcw (delta Tes = -0.54 degrees C), and BTcw (delta Tes = -0.61 degrees C). All levels of underwater exercise elevated Tes and M compared with R at all Tw. In water colder than Tcw, the ratio of heat loss from limbs compared with the trunk became greater as LE intensity increased, indicating a preferential increase in heat loss from the limbs in cool water. Tissue insulation (Itissue) was lower during LE than at R and was inversely proportional to the increase in LE intensity. A linearly inverse relationship was established between Tw and M in maintaining thermal equilibrium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in unanesthetized, chronically catheterized pregnant sheep to determine the fetal behavioral response to prolonged hypoxemia produced by restricting uterine blood flow. Uterine blood flow was reduced by adjusting a vascular occluder placed around the maternal common internal iliac artery to decrease fetal arterial O2 content from 6.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.1 +/- 0.3 ml/dl for 48 h. Associated with the decrease in fetal O2 content, there was a slight increase in fetal arterial PCO2 and decrease in pH, which were both transient. There was an initial inhibition of both fetal breathing movements and eye movements but no change in the pattern of electrocortical activity. After this initial inhibition there was a return to normal incidence of both fetal breathing movements and eye movements by 16 h of the prolonged hypoxemia. These studies indicate that the chronically catheterized sheep fetus is able to adapt behaviorally to a prolonged decrease in arterial O2 content secondary to the restriction of uterine blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the characteristics and function of the muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall, we have examined the isometric contractile properties of bundles of canine rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles. In addition, we have related the lengths of these muscles measured sonometrically in vivo at supine functional residual capacity (FRC) to in vitro optimal force-producing length (Lo). We also investigated the action of the abdominal muscles on the displacement of costal and crural diaphragm. We found that 1) contraction time of RA was longer and that the RA developed greater force than the EO at submaximal stimulation frequencies; 2) maximal tetanic force and the active length-tension curves were similar in both abdominal muscles; 3) on passive stretch, the compliance of the RA was one-third that of the EO; 4) at supine FRC, the EO is operating at 83% of Lo, whereas the RA is operating at 105% of Lo; 5) stimulation of either RA or EO (abdominal pressure of 15 cmH2O) lengthened the costal and crural diaphragm toward their Lo values, with greater crural excursion occurring than costal. We conclude that the RA is well suited for restraining the abdominal viscera in prone quadrupeds, whereas the EO is better designed to assist expiration. Stimulation of both muscles improves in situ diaphragmatic operating length.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in mammals have found that during breathing the triangularis sterni (TS) muscle regulates expiratory airflow and the end-expiratory position of the rib cage and furthermore that the respiratory activity of this muscle is influenced by a variety of chemical and mechanical stimuli. To assess the role of the TS during coughing and sneezing, electromyograms (EMGs) recorded from the TS were compared with EMGs of the transversus abdominis (TA) in eight pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. During coughing induced by mechanically stimulating the trachea or larynx (n = 7 dogs), peak EMGs increased from 23 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 5 U (P less than 0.00002) for the TS and from 21 +/- 6 to 66 +/- 4 U (P less than 0.0002) for the TA. During sneezing induced by mechanically stimulating the nasal mucosa (n = 3 dogs), peak EMG of the TS increased from 10 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 7 U (P less than 0.005) and peak EMG of the TA increased from 10 +/- 2 to 73 +/- 7 U (P less than 0.02). For both muscles the shape of the EMG changed to an early peaking form during coughs and sneezes. Peak expiratory airflow during coughs of different intensity correlated more closely with peak TS EMG in three dogs and with peak TA EMG in four dogs; peak expiratory airflow during sneezes of different intensity correlated more closely with peak TS than TA EMG in all three animals. These results suggest that the TS is actively recruited during coughing and sneezing and that different neuromuscular strategies may be utilized to augment expiratory airflow.\r"

Airway resistance was measured in nine lungs, and in five lungs the site of airway narrowing was located radiographically. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, degassed by O2 absorption, then rapidly exsanguinated when O2 absorption was almost complete. Liquid trapping was assessed from the pressure-volume behaviour measured in saline-filled lungs. During a slow deflation from maximum volume, alveolar liquid pressure (Palv) was measured by the micropipette-servonulling method, airway opening pressure (Pao) by a strain gauge, and flow rate (Q) by weighing a reservoir connected to the airway. Airway resistance (Raw) was calculated at different lung volumes from the relationship: Raw = (Palv-Pao)/Q. In untreated lungs, Raw and fluid trapping were relatively high, and severe bronchoconstriction occurred at the level of the main stem and lobar bronchi. Nifedipine infusion reduced Raw 40-fold and decreased trapping. Raw was further reduced 10-fold and fluid trapping was minimal in lungs pretreated with nifedipine before exsanguination. Results suggest a close association between bronchoconstriction and fluid trapping in guinea pig lungs.\r"

Previous studies have suggested an assumption of a linear dynamic system for O2 uptake kinetics. The implication is that model parameters estimated from ramp tests should be similar to those estimated from other dynamic tests. In nine healthy subjects, we found that model parameters used to characterize O2 consumption ramp data were not consistent with those used to characterize step data, when the comparison was made on a subject-to-subject basis. Furthermore the ramp data model parameter values were highly dependent (P less than 0.0001) on the ramp slope. A linear dynamic system interpretation of the ramp data model does not appear to be appropriate, suggesting that caution is needed in the interpretation of ramp data aerobic parameters. The data may be better described by nonlinear or higher order function. Ramp exercise testing is not suitable for assessing dynamic control properties of the cardiorespiratory response to exercise.\r"

Exercise of the same work load was repeated after 75 min of recovery (exercise II). Exercise duration (range) was 65 (50-90) and 21 (14-30) min for exercise I and II, respectively. Femoral venous blood samples were obtained before and during exercise and analyzed for NH3 and lactate. Plasma NH3 was 12 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 6 mumol/l before exercise I and II, respectively and increased during exercise to exhaustion to peak values of 195 +/- 29 (exercise I) and 250 +/- 30 (exercise II) mumol/l, respectively. Plasma NH3 increased faster during exercise II compared with exercise I and at the end of exercise II was threefold higher than the value for the corresponding time of exercise I (P less than 0.001). Blood lactate increased during exercise I and after 20 min of exercise was 3.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and remained unchanged until exhaustion. During exercise II blood lactate increased less than during exercise I. It is concluded that long-term exercise to exhaustion results in large increases in plasma NH3 despite relatively low levels of blood lactate. It is suggested that the faster increase in plasma NH3 during exercise II (vs. exercise I) reflects an increased formation in the working muscle that may be caused by low glycogen levels and impairment of the ATP resynthesis.\r"

The exercise was repeated on another day with the same power output and duration but without propranolol (control). The total adenine nucleotide (TAN) content in muscle (quadriceps femoris) decreased during exercise, and the decrease was more pronounced during beta B (delta TAN = 4.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/kg dry wt) than during control (delta TAN = 2.8 +/- 0.9; P less than 0.01, beta B vs. control). The decrease in TAN corresponded with a similar increase in inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). The increase in IMP was more pronounced during beta B (delta IMP = 5.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/kg dry wt) than during control (delta IMP = 2.8 +/- 0.7; P less than 0.05, beta B vs. control). Similarly, the increase in the content of NH3 in muscle was twice as high during beta B vs. control (P less than 0.01). The increase in muscle lactate and the decrease in phosphocreatine during exercise were similar between treatments, but postexercise hexose phosphates were approximately twofold higher (P less than 0.05) during control than during beta B. It is concluded that beta B enhances the degradation of TAN and the production of NH3 and IMP in muscle during intense exercise. This indicates that the imbalance between the rates of utilization and resynthesis of ATP is more pronounced during beta B possibly because of a decreased O2 transport to the contracting muscle and a diminished activation of glycolysis by the hexose phosphates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also measured the blood flow to several other tissues in the cat. Blood flow experiments were performed on 13 cats that were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with air. Different numbers of differently labeled 9-, 15-, and 25-micron microspheres were injected via a catheter into the left atrium. It was determined that one injection of 5 x 10(6) 15-micron microspheres was appropriate for the determination of carotid body blood flow. Flows to the carotid bodies and other organs by use of this protocol were as follows (ml.min-1.100 g-1, means +/- SE): carotid bodies, 1,417 +/- 143; adrenal glands, 406 +/- 89; left kidney, 355 +/- 69; right kidney, 375 +/- 74; heart, 201 +/- 39; liver 81 +/- 14; pancreas, 80 +/- 21; superior cervical ganglia, 62 +/- 9; carotid artery wall, 2.4 +/- 1.1. The blood flow to the carotid bodies was the highest for any organ. This measurement provides new evidence that tissue blood flow to the carotid body is very high. This high flow is consistent with the prompt physiological reflex functions of the carotid body.\r"

Additional results suggest that a few respiratory neurons near the retrofacial nucleus may be involved in the mediation of the inspiratory inhibitory effects of intercostal tendon organs. These results do not establish the mechanism by which intercostal muscle tendon organs reduces medullary inspiratory activity.\r"

By the use of an extended version of the system to measure active drag (MAD system), Pd was measured directly. Simultaneous measurement of O2 uptake (VO2) enabled the establishment of the relationship between the rate of the energy expenditure (PVO2) and Po (since when swimming on the MAD system Po = Pd). These individual relationships describing the mechanical efficiency (8-12%) were then used to estimate Po in free swimming from measurements of VO2. Because Pd was directly measured at each velocity studied by use of the MAD system, ep could be calculated according to the equation ep = Pd/(Pd + Pk) = Pd/Po. For the four top class swimmers studied, ep was found to range from 46 to 77%. Total efficiency, defined as the product of mechanical and propelling efficiency, ranged from 5 to 8%.\r"

We therefore examined these pathways, measuring tension in an innervated tracheal segment, flow resistance in more distal airways, and dynamic compliance, in 10 anesthetized mechanically ventilated cats. Initially, cervical vagal stimulation evoked contraction followed by relaxation of smooth muscle of trachea and lower airways; sympathetic stimulation evoked relaxation only. After muscarinic blockade and restoration of smooth muscle tone with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) applied topically to the tracheal mucosa, vagal stimulation did not affect tracheal segment tension, whereas sympathetic-evoked relaxation was preserved. Similar results were found when tone was restored with intravenous 5-HT, with vagal stimulation also decreasing resistance and increasing compliance. We conclude that NANC pathways are present in lower airways but not in the cervical trachea of the cat. We hypothesize that parasympathetic constriction of cat airway smooth muscle can occur without simultaneous NANC activation, whereas NANC activity occurs only in tandem with parasympathetic stimulation.\r"

Animals that received BCNU and were immediately exposed to hyperbaric O2 showed enhanced toxicity by seizing earlier in the exposure than controls. Animals that received BCNU 18 h before the hyperbaric O2 exposure were paradoxically protected from the effects of the exposure with a prolongation of their time to initial seizure and a marked increase in their survival time during the exposure. Tissue glutathione concentrations were also measured in the various groups and the hyperbaric O2 exposure produced marked decreases in hepatic glutathione levels in all control animals. In animals treated with BCNU 18 h before exposure, hepatic glutathione concentrations also decreased, but the concentrations had significantly increased during the 18-h waiting period, allowing these animals to maintain hepatic levels in the normal range even during their hyperbaric exposures. We conclude that treatment of rats with BCNU 18 h before exposure to hyperbaric hyperoxia results in enhanced protection of the animals during the exposure.\r"

To determine whether hypoxia due to decompression causes weight loss, six men, provided with a palatable ad libitum diet, were studied during progressive decompression to 240 Torr over 40 days in a hypobaric chamber where hypoxia was the major environmental variable. Caloric intake decreased 43.0% from 3,136 to 1,789 kcal/day (P less than 0.001). The percent carbohydrate in the diet decreased from 62.1 to 53.2% (P less than 0.001). Over the 40 days of the study the subjects lost 7.4 +/- 2.2 (SD) kg and 1.6% (2.5 kg) of the total body weight as fat. Computerized tomographic scans indicated that most of the weight loss was derived from fat-free weight. The data indicated that prolonged exposure to the increasing hypoxia was associated with a reduction in carbohydrate preference and body weight despite access to ample varieties and quantities of food. This study suggested that hypoxia can be sufficient cause for the weight loss and decreased food consumption reported by mountain expeditions at high altitude.\r"

Glucose infusion equaled the average exercise-induced increase from basal to steady state in HGP found in saline-infused control rats. Rats were studied at two work loads, running at 21 (series I) or 18 m/min (series II) for 35 min. Glucose turnover was measured by means of an intravenous [3H]glucose infusion. HGP was suppressed by glucose infusion corresponding to the infused amount of glucose in both series, except for late in exercise in series I, where HGP plus infused glucose tended to exceed HGP in saline-infused rats (P less than 0.10). Muscle glycogenolysis and fat metabolism were similar in both groups in the two series. Plasma glucose was never elevated, whereas insulin was, in glucose- vs. saline-infused rats of both series. Plasma catecholamines were lower in glucose- compared with saline-infused rats in series II. In conclusion, HGP is very sensitive to metabolic feedback inhibition at low exercise intensities. Feedforward control of HGP may play a role at higher work loads (series I). Exogenously supplied glucose, in moderate amounts, may replace HGP specifically without concomitant changes in mobilization of other substrates.\r"

The hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was determined from the rate of volume flux in response to hydrostatic pressure gradients applied to either the mucosal or serosal surface of the pleural membrane. The diffusional permeability (Pd) of radiolabeled water, sucrose, inulin, and albumin was determined under equilibrium conditions from the unidirectional tracer flux. The Lp of the visceral pleura was 0.39 +/- 0.032 (SE) X 10(-4) ml.s-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2 and that Lp of parietal pleura was 1.93 +/- 0.93 X 10(-4) ml.s-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2 (P less than 0.001). The Pd of the visceral pleura ranged from 12.21 +/- 0.45 X 10(-4) cm/s for 3H2O to 0.34 +/- 0.03 X 10(-4) cm/s for [3H]albumin. The Pd of the parietal pleura for water and sucrose was similar to that of the visceral membrane, whereas its Pd for the larger inulin and albumin molecules was greater than that of visceral pleura (P less than 0.01). A spontaneous potential difference could not be detected across either membrane. The relatively higher parietal pleural Lp and Pd for larger solutes is probably due to the presence of stomata in this membrane. These results indicate that both the parietal and the visceral pleura are extremely permeable tissues which offer little resistance to water and solute flux.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure-volume measurements and the punch indentation test are used to obtain the bulk modulus (kappa) and the shear modulus (mu) of lung parenchyma of air- and liquid-filled rabbit lungs. Plots of kappa and mu vs. transpulmonary pressure obtained from these measurements indicate that there is very little difference between the elastic behavior of the air- and liquid-filled lung, suggesting that the mechanism of resisting deformation in both cases is similar. On the other hand, from plots of kappa and mu vs. lung volume, it appears that the elastic moduli are higher in the air-filled lung than in the liquid-filled lung at the same volume. These differences, referred to as kappa gamma and mu gamma, as well as the difference in transpulmonary pressures (P gamma), are presumably due to the additional elastic recoil of the air-filled lung provided by alveolar surface tension (gamma). No conclusion could be reached about the shape of the kappa gamma vs. P gamma curve. However, the mu gamma vs. P gamma relationship appears to be approximately linear, with a slope of approximately 0.5. This result agrees qualitatively with the model (T. A. Wilson and H. Bachofen, J. Appl. Physiol. 52: 1064-1070, 1982) in which the part of the parenchyma that provides P gamma is pictured as mechanically analogous to an open cell liquid foam, having mu gamma = 0.4P gamma (J. Appl. Mech. Trans. ASME 51: 229-231, 1984), but it is statistically significant only at high lung volumes.\r"

In this hemodilution experiment, the rabbits were ventilated by an intermittent positive pressure of 6 mmHg at a frequency of 30-35 cycles/min. Based on the Fahraeus effect for capillary blood flows and the dispersion of the density indicator in the rabbit's central circulation, we computed from the fluctuation of the measured density within a ventilation cycle the fluctuation of pulmonary capillary blood volume and found it to be 4.1 +/- 0.4% of the capillary blood volume for all hematocrits. Since the same fluctuation in the airway pressure was used to induce the volumetric fluctuation, its independence of Ha indicates that the hemodilution has no effect on the viscoelasticity of pulmonary capillaries.\r"

SP alone (10(-7) to 10(-4) M; each concentration, 7 breaths) caused no change in total pulmonary resistance (RL, P greater than 0.5). Phosphoramidon (10(-4) M, 90 breaths) caused no change either in base-line RL (P greater than 0.5) or in the response to aerosolized acetylcholine (P greater than 0.5). However, in the presence of phosphoramidon, SP (7 breaths) produced a concentration-dependent increase in RL at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-5) M (P less than 0.001). Phosphoramidon (10(-7) to 10(-4) M; each concentration, 90 breaths) induced a concentration-dependent potentiation of SP-induced bronchoconstriction (10(-4) M, 7 breaths; P less than 0.01). Vagus nerve stimulation (0.5-3 Hz), in the presence of atropine, induced a frequency-dependent increase in RL (P less than 0.001). Phosphoramidon potentiated the atropine-resistant responses to vagus nerve stimulation (P less than 0.001) at frequencies greater than 0.5 Hz. The tachykinin antagonist [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P abolished the effects of phosphoramidon on the atropine-resistant response to vagus nerve stimulation (2 Hz, P less than 0.005). NEP-like activity in tracheal homogenates of guinea pig was inhibited by phosphoramidon with a concentration producing 50% inhibition of 5.3 +/- 0.8 nM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven sea level resident males, aged 22 +/- 1 yr, performed moderate to near-maximal steady-state cycle exercise at sea level in normoxia [inspired PO2 (PIO2) 150 Torr] and acute hypobaric hypoxia (barometric pressure, 445 Torr; PIO2, 83 Torr), and after 18 days' residence on Pikes Peak (4,300 m) while breathing ambient air (PIO2, 86 Torr) and air similar to that at sea level (35% O2, PIO2, 144 Torr). In both hypoxia and normoxia, after acclimatization the femoral arterial-iliac venous O2 content difference, hemoglobin concentration, and arterial O2 content, were higher than before acclimatization, but the venous PO2 (PVO2) was unchanged. Thermodilution leg blood flow was lower but calculated arterial O2 delivery and leg VO2 similar in hypoxia after vs. before acclimatization. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance in hypoxia were greater after, than before, acclimatization. We concluded that acclimatization did not increase O2 delivery but rather maintained delivery via increased arterial oxygenation and decreased leg blood flow. The maintenance of PVO2 and the higher MAP after acclimatization suggested matching of O2 delivery to tissue O2 demands, with vasoconstriction possibly contributing to the decreased flow.\r"

SMDS was computed according to the following equation: SMDS = (BW) (K) (CKr), where BW is body weight, K is a constant, and CKr is the cumulative amount of creatine kinase (CK) released over time. The method takes into account CK distribution space, fractional disappearance rate of CK, proportion of CK degraded in skeletal muscle, and proportion of CK released into the circulation. Assumptions are made regarding the relative amount of CK lost from skeletal muscle into the circulation. The SMDS in men, 808 +/- 1,229 (SD) CK g-eq was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than in women, 160 +/- 147 (SD) CK g-eq. The ranges of SMDS (CK g-eq) were 23-5,397 in men and 7-624 in women. A significant difference (P less than 0.05) also remained after correction for body surface area; men 432 +/- 583 (SD), women 100 +/- 63 (SD) CK g-eq/m2. In men and women, no significant correlation existed between SMDS and age or marathon finish time. Although relatively theoretical, results indicate that greater skeletal muscle damage occurred in men vs. women runners after a marathon. Whether the release of CK from skeletal muscle is the result of irreversible and/or reversible injury has not yet been determined.\r"

On two separate occasions, 10 highly trained distance runners increased their training load for 5 days (20 km/day, approximately 80% maximal O2 consumption) while eating a diet whose carbohydrate composition either equaled (EQ-CHO) or contained approximately 50% of the runner's estimated daily expenditure (LO-CHO). Total muscle glycogen levels were lower after the LO-CHO regimen. Photometric analysis of the glycogen content in individual fibers revealed that 27% type I and 17% type II fibers had optical densities less than 0.2 U after the LO-CHO regimen, whereas 7% type I and 0% type II were similarly depleted after the EQ-CHO diet. A linear relationship was observed between the histochemical and direct chemical analysis of muscle glycogen content. Treadmill O2 uptake measured at 185 and 238 m/min was higher during the LO-CHO than the EQ-CHO regimen. Ratings of perceived exertion were higher during the 238-m/min run for the LO-CHO regimen. After 3 days of rest, running economy and perception of effort returned to pretraining levels and muscle glycogen stores were approximately 85% of the pretraining values. Thus when CHO intake was only approximately 50% of the energy requirements there was a marked depletion of muscle glycogen stores, particularly in type I fibers, and a concomitant decrease in running economy and increased perception of fatigue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, lungs from hypoxia-preexposed rats developed less acute edematous injury (decreased lung weight gains and lung lavage albumin concentrations) than lungs from normoxia-preexposed rats when isolated and perfused with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by xanthine oxidase (XO) or glucose oxidase (GO). In contrast, when perfused with elastase or exposed to a hydrostatic left atrial pressure challenge, lungs isolated from hypoxia-preexposed rats developed the same acute edematous injury as lungs from normoxia-preexposed rats. The mechanism by which hypoxia preexposure conferred protection against H2O2 appeared to depend on hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS)-dependent increases in lung glutathione redox cycle activity. First, before perfusion with GO, lungs from hypoxia-preexposed rats had increased glutathione peroxidase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (but not catalase or glutathione reductase) activities compared with lungs from normoxia-preexposed rats. Second, after perfusion with GO, lungs from hypoxia-preexposed rats had increased H2O2 reducing equivalents, as reflected by increased GSH/GSSG and NADPH/NADPH+, compared with lungs from normoxia-preexposed rats. Third, pretreatment of rats with an HMPS inhibitor, (6-aminonicotinamide) or a glutathione reductase inhibitor, [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea] prevented hypoxia-conferred protection against H2O2-mediated acute edematous injury in isolated lungs. These findings suggest that increased detoxification of H2O2 by glutathione redox cycle and HMPS-dependent mechanisms contributes to tolerance to hyperoxia and resistance to H2O2 of lungs from hypoxia-preexposed rats.\r"

In the isolated perfused lung of the normal and O2-exposed rat, change in pre- and postcapillary resistance was determined in response to challenge with angiotensin II (ANG II; 5, 25, and 50 micrograms) or histamine (0.5 and 1.0 microgram). In the hyperoxic lung both pre- and postcapillary resistance were increased at base line, although the latter less consistently so. In response to each agent precapillary resistance increased more than postcapillary resistance in the hyperoxic lung. In the normal lung pre- and postcapillary reactivity to histamine were similar but the latter was the greater in response to ANG II. In the hyperoxic lung only the pre- and postcapillary response to the first challenge of ANG II (5 micrograms) was greater than normal. The magnitude of the precapillary response was not related to the level of base-line resistance, and this response was significantly increased in a small number of hyperoxic lungs with base-line resistance in the normal range. Tachyphylaxis occurred after the first dose of ANG II. In the hyperoxic lung only the precapillary response to 0.5 micrograms histamine was greater than normal. We conclude that exposure to hyperoxia for 7 days causes an increase in pulmonary arterial reactivity. Furthermore, the alteration in reactivity is not caused by vascular restriction. We hypothesize that it is attributable to peripheral extension of smooth muscle in alveolar wall arteries.\r"

Beagles from sea level were exposed to an altitude of 3,100 m (PB 525 Torr) for 12-19 mo and compared with age-matched controls remaining at low altitude of 130 m (PB 750 Torr). In beagles taken to high altitude as adults, pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) at 3,100 m were 21.6 +/- 2.6 vs. 13.2 +/- 1.2 Torr in controls. Likewise, in beagles taken to 3,100 m as puppies 2.5 mo old, PAP was 23.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 13.8 +/- 0.4 Torr in controls. This PH reflected a doubling of pulmonary vascular resistance and showed no progression with time at altitude. Pulmonary vascular reactivity to acute hypoxia was also enhanced at 3,100 m. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis did not attenuate the PH or the enhanced reactivity. Once established, the PH was only partially reversed by acute relief of chronic hypoxia, but reversal was virtually complete after return to low altitude. Hence, beagles do develop PH at 3,100 m of a severity comparable to that observed in humans at the same or even higher altitudes.\r"

The regional flow per unit volume was shown to correspond to the time derivative of the regional activity of the dynamic series divided by the corresponding activity. Both the relative timing of the gas flow to different lung regions and the flow per unit volume as a function of time were obtained from the dynamic series. The dependent lung was seen to be better ventilated throughout the respiratory cycle except for brief periods at the start of inspiration and the end of expiration. Most of the dead-space gas can be construed to enter and leave the dependent lung.\r"

Data for speech production indicated that the lateral region of the abdomen was highly active in the upright position and occasionally active in the supine position. In the upright position, lateral EMG levels during speech production were characterized by generally higher levels in the lower than upper lateral sites and were almost always higher than during resting tidal breathing. In the supine position, EMG levels during speech production occasionally exceeded those associated with resting tidal breathing but were substantially lower than those associated with upright speech production. Abdominal EMG activity was most prevalent during loud speech production and during speech produced at low lung volumes.

Maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), ventilatory anaerobic threshold, and O2 uptake kinetics were assessed. Metabolic control was optimized 12 h prior to and during testing by intravenous insulin infusion. Patients with diabetic neuropathy had a reduced VO2max [83 +/- 6% predicted vs. 104 +/- 6% (nonneuropathic diabetics) and 107 +/- 5% (normals); P less than 0.05]. However, there was no difference in ventilatory anaerobic threshold [14.8 +/- 0.9 (neuropathic diabetics) vs. 18.0 +/- 1.0 (nonneuropathic diabetics) and 16.7 +/- 1.5 ml O2.kg-1.min-1 (normals); P greater than 0.25]. The phase I increment in O2 uptake (VO2) and estimated cardiac output and the time constant of VO2 during constant-load exercise at 40% VO2max also were similar in all groups. We propose that the instantaneous increase in VO2 and cardiac output at exercise onset in diabetes with impaired neurogenic reflexes is caused primarily by mechanical and metabolic events in exercising muscle that cause venous compression and vasodilation.\r"

In the present study we isolated alveolar type II cells from rabbits at various times during hyperoxic exposure and recovery and measured rates of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, cellular lipid content, and the specific activity of glycerol 3-phosphate (G-3-P) acyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes one of the early reactions in phosphoglyceride biosynthesis. These biochemical parameters were compared with measurements of cell size and cell cycle phase by laser flow cytometry. Results showed that alterations in alveolar phospholipid levels in vivo correlated consistently with cellular lipid metabolic changes measured in isolated type II pneumocytes. In particular, alveolar pneumocytes isolated from lungs of rabbits exposed to 100% O2 for 64 h exhibited a 60% decrease in PC synthesis, cell lipid content, and G-3-P acyltransferase activity. All variables then followed a pattern of recovery to normal and ultimately supranormal levels beginning at approximately 3 days postexposure, at which point there was also a measured increase in the number of type II cells in S phase. These findings suggest that O2-induced changes in type II cell surfactant biosynthesis may account, at least in part, for observed changes in lung phospholipid levels in vivo.\r"

Twitch force after the fatigue test was potentiated (i.e., greater than the value before the fatigue test) in many muscles, despite the development of considerable fatigue. This coexistence of fatigue and twitch potentiation was observed in 7% (5/70) of soleus and 48% (31/64) of extensor digitorum longus muscles. The coexistence was exhibited only by the least fatigable muscles of the fast-contracting extensor digitorum longus. The extensor digitorum longus muscles that did not exhibit twitch potentiation probably experienced a higher proportion of muscle-fiber inactivation, such as due to failure of neuromuscular propagation, that was induced by the fatigue regimen.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the nature of the combined effect of the hypoxias of altitude (ALT) and CO exposure, 11 men and 12 women nonsmokers served as subjects in a double-blind experiment. The exposure conditions were four ambient CO levels (0, 50, 100, and 150 ppm) at each of four ALT (55, 1,524, 2,134, and 3,048 m). Each subject, after attaining the required ALT and ambient CO level, performed a maximal aerobic capacity test (VO2max). Blood samples were obtained before, at 50-W, 100-W, 150-W, and maximum work loads and at the 5th min of recovery. Blood were analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit, plasma proteins, lactates, and carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). VO2max was similar at 55 and 1,524 m and decreased by 4 and 8% from the 55-m value at 2,134 and 3,048 m, respectively. On the basis of all statistical analyses, we concluded that VO2max values measured in men were only slightly diminished due to increased ambient CO. HbCO attained at maximum was highest at 55 m and lowest at 3,048 m. Women's HbCO concentrations were lower than men's. At maximal work loads CO shifted into extravascular spaces and returned to the vascular space within 5 min after exercise stopped. The independence of altitude and CO hypoxias on parameters of the maximum aerobic capacity test and a decrease in the CO to HbCO uptake with increasing altitude were demonstrated and attributed in part to the decrease in driving pressure of CO at altitude.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies using inanimate and animal models suggest that the afterdrop observed upon rewarming from hypothermia is based entirely on physical laws of heat flow without involvement of the returning cooled blood from the limbs. During the investigation of thermoregulatory responses to cold water immersion (15 degrees C), blood flow to the limbs (minimized by the effects of hydrostatic pressure and vasoconstriction) was occluded in 17 male subjects (age, 29.0 +/- 3.3 yr). Comparisons of rectal (Tre) and esophageal temperature (Tes) responses were made during the 5 min before occlusion, during the 10-min occlusion period, and for 5 min immediately after the release of the cuffs (postocclusion). In the preocclusion phase, Tre and Tes showed similar cooling rates. The occlusion of blood flow to the extremities significantly arrested the cooling of Tes (P less than 0.05) with little effect on Tre. Upon release of the pressure cuffs, the returning extremity blood flow resulted in an increased rate of cooling, that was three times greater at the esophageal site (-0:149 +/- 0.052 vs. -0.050 +/- 0.026 degrees C.min-1). These results suggest that the cooled peripheral circulation, minimized during cold water immersion, may dramatically affect esophageal temperature and the complete neglect of the circulatory component to the afterdrop phenomenon is not warranted.\r"

The effects of using liquid O2 and compressed O2 apparatus were compared in each subject. Evaporative heat exchange was much greater with the liquid O2 type of apparatus, causing a significantly lower rate of rise of rectal temperature and heart rate. Convective heat exchange was negligible. Mean values for evaporative heat loss (maximum) were 61 +/- 16 (SD) W with liquid O2 and 20 +/- 18 W with compressed O2 (P less than 0.0001, 2-sided t test). Mean values for rectal temperature (rate of increase) were 0.022 +/- 0.009 (SD) degrees C.min-1 for liquid O2 and 0.036 +/- 0.015 degrees C.min-1 for compressed O2 (P less than 0.005, 2-sided paired t test).

This study quantifies, for the first time, the respiratory enthalpy change in exercising heat-stressed mine rescue workers and shows, from a physiological point of view, that the liquid O2 apparatus is clearly superior to the compressed O2 apparatus.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of atropine on lung function and airway reactivity in two groups of ponies were measured. Principal ponies had a history of recurrent airway obstruction when housed in a barn and fed hay; control ponies had no history of airway obstruction. Principal and control ponies were paired, and measurements were made when principal ponies were in clinical remission (period A) and during an acute attack of airway obstruction (period B). Atropine did not alter pulmonary resistance (RL), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), or airway responsiveness in either group of ponies at period A or in the controls at period B. In principal ponies at period B, atropine did not alter Cdyn or the concentration of aerosol histamine required to decrease Cdyn to 65% of base line (ED65Cdyn) but reduced RL and the change in RL induced by 0.1 mg/ml histamine (delta RL0.1). It is likely that the latter observation was due to geometric changes in the airways, because the change in RL and in delta RL0.1 were significantly correlated. The results of this study show little resting bronchomotor tone in normal ponies, but a major portion of the increase in RL in principals at period B is mediated via muscarinic receptors. Little evidence exists for muscarinic receptor involvement in the response to aerosol histamine in either principal or control ponies.\r"

In a preliminary study (study A), we showed that the resistance plus TFD was effective in controlling breathing strategy. We subsequently used the resistor plus TFD in a 5-wk study (study B) of VMT in 17 COPD patients who were randomized into high-intensity (HI) and low-intensity (LI) training groups. Compared with the LI group, the HI group showed significant increases in static maximal inspiratory pressure (21.3 vs. 5.0 cmH2O), maximal sustained ventilatory capacity (MSVC, 3.2 vs -0.1 l/min, sustained maximal mouth pressure (12.1 vs. 0.6 cmH2O), mean mouth pressure (6.9 vs. 3.9 cmH2O), peak inspiratory flow rate (12.3 vs. 4.0 l/min), and maximal sustained work rate (12.2 vs. 4.2 cmH2O.l-1.min-1). We conclude that targeted VMT with control of breathing strategy improves both ventilatory muscle strength and endurance.\r"

In six prone sheep, we therefore measured pulmonary airflow resistance (RL) and cumulative aerosol deposition during five standard breaths (AD5) at base line and 3 min after inhalation challenge with 2% carbachol in buffered saline (10 breaths, tidal volume = 500 ml) or after an intravenous loading dose of carbachol (3 micrograms/kg) followed by a constant infusion of 0.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 with and without instillation of 20 ml of a mucus simulant (MS) into the distal end of each of the main bronchi or 30 ml of MS into the right main bronchus only by means of a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope. Before carbachol challenge, RL did not change with MS into either both lungs or one lung only. AD5 increased from 36 +/- 2% (SE) before to 42 +/- 2% after MS instillation into both lungs (P less than 0.05) but remained unchanged after MS into one lung. After carbachol inhalation, RL increased significantly by 154 +/- 20 before and 126 +/- 25% after MS into both lungs and 162 +/- 24 before and 178 +/- 31% after MS into one lung (P less than 0.05). When the percent increase in RL was normalized for total aerosol deposition (% delta RL/AD5), the normalized values were lower after MS (3.0 +/- 0.5) than before MS (4.4 +/- 0.3) into both lungs (P less than 0.05) but were not significantly different before and after MS into the right lung only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of hemodynamics and blood metabolites in rats are often made by insertion of a small polyethylene (PE-50) catheter into the aorta via the carotid artery. Although the effect of this type of procedure on animal body weight has been described, little information exists regarding the quantitative and temporal effects of this procedure on liver and skeletal muscle glycogen concentration. Relative to the control group (group C), liver glycogen concentration was reduced by 56% 24 h after catheterization (group CN). With respect to liver glycogen concentration, it was apparent that a postcatheterization recovery period of variable duration (2-8 days; group CNR) based on attainment of a normal food consumption-to-body weight ratio (FdWt/BdWt) was more effective than was a fixed 6-day recovery period (group CN6). This was probably due to the large between-animal variability in recovery times required to reach normal FdWt/BdWt values. After aortic catheterization, FdWt/BdWt was a reasonable predictor of postprocedural liver (y = 2,601x + 43.9; r = 0.72; P less than 0.01) and diaphragm muscle glycogen concentration (y = 146.3x + 14.0; r = 0.57; P less than 0.05). Aortic catheterization did not affect the glycogen concentration in the other skeletal muscles examined. Since the results of certain types of experiments can be significantly influenced by liver glycogen concentration, the use of FdWt/BdWt on 24-h food intake as a general indicator of recovery after instrumentation via aortic catheterization is proposed.\r"

It was always ipsilateral to the associated paraesthesiae/numbness (9 cases) and weakness (6 cases). The distribution and restricted localisations of limb pain were similar to those of the sensory symptoms and could not be accounted for by primary dysfunction of the peripheral or autonomic nervous systems. A central origin for limb pain is postulated. A temporary dysfunction in the somatosensory cortex, and/or its thalamic connections, during migraine or cluster headache attacks, might mediate such pain in a number of patients.\r"

The findings are discussed in relation to (1) functional convergence of different sensory fibres on central neurons (2) the phenomenon of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and (3) secondary hyperalgesia. The observed effect of clinical pain on the warm pathway could be explained as an intrasegmental noxious inhibitory effect.\r"

Median nerve SEPs were normal in all cases. In posterior tibial nerve SEPs, the potential recorded at the 12th thoracic spinal process was normal in every case but cortical components were significantly prolonged in 10 cases, although five of these showed no sensory impairment. BAEPs were normal in every case whose hearing was intact, but VEPs were abnormal in two cases whose visual acuities were normal. The present results in HAM indicate predominant lesion in the thoracic cord, and might also suggest some subclinical lesion in the visual pathway.\r"

No significant differences in HLA-A or -B antigen frequencies were found in any comparisons of these groups. However, in comparisons of seropositive AIDS-free men with the AIDS groups, HLA-Cw7 was increased in frequency in OI and HLA-DR1, -DRw14, and -DQw1 in KS. HLA-DR3 and -DQw3 frequencies were decreased in KS, and DRw53 was decreased in OI. In a cohort of 102 HIV seropositive individuals that were followed for a mean of 43 months, AIDS developed in HLA-DR1 positive men more frequently than in individuals with other HLA-DR phenotypes (p = 0.02). These results demonstrate probable genetic differences between individuals developing KS and OI and indicate that the HLA-DR1 phenotype is a risk factor in disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.\r"

Antibodies to HTLV-I were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using purified disrupted whole virus as antigen, with confirmation by p24 protein RIA or competitive binding. Four of 63 SLE patients were HTLV-I seropositive (6.3%). There was no evidence for excess HTLV-I infection in SLE patients when their age- and sex-standardized HTLV-I seroprevalence rate was compared to that of a large group of healthy food service employees. None of 13 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were seropositive for HTLV-I. We conclude that HTLV-I infection does not appear to be linked with SLE in Jamaica.\r"

Cryptococcal meningitis is most prevalent among intravenous drug abusers, Haitians, and blacks, and is most commonly reported in New Jersey, a state with a large proportion of AIDS patients in these three groups. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is reported much more often in Haitians than in other risk groups and is most prevalent in Florida among both Haitians and non-Haitians, probably because of greater exposure to Toxoplasma gondii organisms in the semitropical climate of Florida. The prevalence rates for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and primary central nervous system lymphoma are similar throughout various risk groups and regions of the United States.\r"

Until then five cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had been registered in Angola. During this study, another three cases with clinical AIDS were found and confirmed by HIV-1 serology. A total of 1,215 sera from groups of healthy persons and patients were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2/HTLV-IV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Sera positive by ELISA were also tested by Western blot (WB) analysis. In Luanda, the capital, HIV-1 antibodies were demonstrated in 0.4% (2/452) of male blood donors, in 0.3% (1/357) of pregnant women, in 1% (1/100) of tuberculosis patients, in 4% (4/94) of patients at medical wards, and in none of 22 women hospitalized with pelvic infections. In the Cabinda province, 11% (4/38) of postnatal women at a maternity ward were found to be HIV-1 seropositive, but only 2% (1/55) of other hospitalized patients and none of 32 male blood donors or 59 healthy persons in a village on the border to Zaire. Specific antibodies to HIV-2/HTLV-IV were not found in any of the sera. However, 16 out of 17 HIV-1 positive sera cross-reacted with HIV-2/HTLV-IV core proteins by WB. In October 1987, 280 of the blood donors from Luanda were retested for HIV-1 antibodies and one of them was found to have seroconverted during the previous year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 2651 diagnostic and screening specimens in the province of Manitoba submitted over a similar period, 103 were positive (3.9%). HIV seropositivity in Manitoba was noted mainly in homosexual/bisexual males (especially those who were also intravenous drug abusers), hemophiliacs, and individuals from endemic regions of the world. Individuals whose only risk factor was intravenous drug abuse, those with sexually transmitted diseases, or those with high risk sex contacts have not demonstrated HIV seropositivity in Manitoba to date. Manitoba is currently a low seroprevalence region for HIV infection. Our study demonstrated that the awareness level of people at risk for HIV infections was low. In our study population, one-on-one counseling was demonstrated to be an effective way to improve short-term knowledge about HIV infections. Appropriate education approaches must be considered for Native/Metis peoples (26.4% of our MAVES study population), who were younger and had a lower educational and employment level compared to Caucasian/other racial groups.\r"

Twelve men (10%) were seropositive for HIV and 6 (5%) for HTLV-I; 1 man had possible coinfection with HIV and HTLV-I. One third of the men reported having had homosexual encounters with foreign visitors or while travelling outside Jamaica, and sexual contact with men in the U.S. was weakly associated with HIV infection (p = 0.11). The median number of partners was 12 per year (range 0-135) and a greater number of homosexual partners per year was associated with HIV seropositivity (p = 0.01). HIV seropositives also were more likely to have a history of lymphadenopathy (p = 0.07). For HTLV-I, there were no obvious risk factors identified, and age-adjusted seroprevalence was not significantly higher than that of heterosexual men. Compared to studies of homosexual men in the U.S. prior to the advent of extensive AIDS education, the Jamaican homosexual population was more sexually conservative. Despite this circumstance, HIV appears to have entered this population via sexual contact with foreign men and spread efficiently among men with a greater number of sexual partners. The frequency of bisexuality (65/125 men) and the 11% HIV prevalence in bisexual men suggest that secondary infection of female sexual partners may occur.\r"

Study participants each had a median of 200 different sexual partners in the preceding year. Six women had a history of intravenous drug abuse and none had a history of any other recognized risk factor for HIV infection. Ninety percent of the women studied used condoms during intercourse with at least some of their partners. One of the six women with a history of drug abuse and none of the 72 non-drug-abusers were seropositive for HIV. This study indicates that despite their promiscuity, HIV infection is still uncommon in call girls in New York City.\r"

Data were collected once from 178 patients using a modified version of the AIDS Beliefs and Behaviors Questionnaire (ABBQ). Study results showed that in 1987, most outpatients (73%) in an AIDS epicenter wanted more information about building their immune systems. Few patients (12%) wanted more explicit information about safe sexual behaviors, although 3 years into the epidemic this information was a central concern. Results suggest that health professionals need to take an active role in monitoring and addressing patients' changing informational needs.\r"

Attention is focused on the part models can play in short-term prediction, parameter estimation, the interpretation of observed patterns, and the identification of areas in which knowledge is inadequate. Methods for short-term predictions, over 1-3 years, have proved reliable and can take account of distributed delays in the interval between reporting and diagnosis. Parametric and nonparametric methods have been developed for estimating summary statistics (e.g., means) for the distributed incubation period of AIDS. Current estimates, based on cohort or transfusion-associated AIDS cases, lie in the range of 7-10 years. Transmission models for longer-term prediction are less reliable at present given the many uncertainties concerning key epidemiological parameters. Theoretical studies highlight the need for quantitative data on temporal changes in the distribution of rates of sexual partner change and fluctuations in viral abundance in serum, secretions, and excretions (i.e., infectiousness) throughout the long and variable incubation period of the disease.\r"

Recently there has been increased public and research attention to this problem. Five areas of public health concern for AIDS among i.v. drug users are identified and discussed: (a) the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to drug users in developing countries; (b) the emergence of cocaine use associated with HIV infection; (c) ethnic differences in seroprevalence rates among i.v. drug users, with ethnic minorities tending to have higher rates; (d) difficulties in changing the sexual behavior of i.v. drug users; and (e) an increased frequency of fatal infections among HIV seropositive drug users that are not counted with the current surveillance definition of AIDS. There have been numerous studies of AIDS risk reduction among i.v. drug users, but the ultimate effect of the behavior change on spread of the virus is not yet clear. Preliminary studies from New York City, San Francisco, and Stockholm indicate a relative stabilization of seroprevalence in those cities, suggesting that the behavior changes reported in those cities may be significantly slowing the rate of viral spread.\r"

Innovations include dedicated inpatient and outpatient AIDS treatment and research units, extensive community service organizations, active volunteers, hospices, visiting nurses, AIDS information hot lines, confidential testing sites, outpatient infusion centers, integration of research and clinical care, and new roles for health professionals including AIDS as an unofficial medical subspecialty. Patient care has replaced medical care, and nurture and technology must coexist when a cure cannot be assured. Physicians expecting choice in patients they care for must accept HIV; staggering health care costs, a sorely taxed public care system, fear of infection or medical inadequacy, declining nursing school enrollment, decreased interest in primary care medical specialties, a dwindling supply of community volunteers, and sparse extended care facilities hamper our efforts to provide for AIDS patients. However, the abundance of vacant hospital beds, the social and scientific challenge of AIDS care and research, employment opportunities, and a new generation of health care professionals accepting AIDS as part of the challenge of medicine all offer hope for change. In AIDS, we have the opportunity to strike an alliance between the art of healing and the advanced technology of modern medicine. In doing so, we will all face our own mortality.\r"

In this paper, attention is drawn to the limitations of the law in achieving the modification of human behavior. Successes and failures in public health education campaigns, directed to the same end, are mentioned. The author cautions against putting too much trust in the law to achieve containment of the AIDS virus. However, there are three reasons for optimism about the developing laws on AIDS. These are the necessity of a rare degree of international cooperation, the encouragement of attention to fresh approaches to laws on human sexuality and drug taking, and the vital importance of attention to the neglected issues of efficiency and cost effectiveness in the design of new laws. This last point leads to a suggestion that AIDS has produced three new viruses called \"HIL\" (highly inefficient laws). HIL-I is the mandatory testing of the entire population for HIV antibodies. HIL-II is the mandatory testing of specially vulnerable groups, especially foreigners. HIL-III is the mandatory requirement of HIV-free certificates at the frontier. The ineffectiveness and potential for injustice of such laws are exposed. The lesson derived is that there is no \"quick fix\" either for the AIDS virus itself or for the social and legal problems presented by it.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if alterations exist in three early stimulatory events of PMN function in individuals with intraoral manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Peripheral PMNs were isolated from nine HIV-seropositive male homosexuals with HIV-associated periodontitis and intraoral candidiasis and healthy HIV-seronegative age-matched heterosexuals (controls). Phagocytosis was assessed using fluorescent microspheres, oxidative burst was assessed via hydrolysis of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (FCDH) to 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (FCDA) with PMA stimulation, and F-actin formation was assessed with NBD-phallacidin stain after stimulation with f-Met-Leu-Phe. Compared to controls, seven of nine HIV-seropositive patients demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of phagocytic cells while seven of nine HIV-seropositive patients demonstrated a 5-59% increase in number of beads per cell. In the oxidative burst assay, seven of seven HIV-seropositive patients demonstrated a significant increase over controls in FCDA stain with PMA stimulation. In the F-actin assay, four of five HIV-seropositive patients demonstrated a significant increase over controls in NBD-phallacidin staining after f-Met-Leu-Phe stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the hypothesis that individuals infected with human immune deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience significant, specific alterations in mechanisms protecting the oral cavity prior to the appearance of AIDS-related systemic opportunistic infections. In a study of 13 early-stage, stable anti-HIV antibody positive patients, parotid salivary function was found to be generally intact. In contrast, several indicators of submandibular gland dysfunction were detected. In particular, stimulated fluid output was decreased and salivary lysozyme levels were increased relative to controls by 50-60% for both resting (p less than 0.05) and stimulated (p less than 0.001) conditions. Also, the frequency of albumin detection in submandibular saliva samples was approximately 65% in HIV-1 infected patients vs. 0% in controls (p less than 0.05). In addition, cytologic evaluation of oral mucosa revealed a fivefold increase in the prevalence of candidal hyphae in HIV-1 infected patients compared to controls (41% vs. 8%, p less than 0.05). We conclude that normal oral defense mechanisms show signs of compromise in HIV-1 infected individuals. We suggest that (a) effects of HIV-1 infection are seen early in the oral cavity, (b) impairment of oral defense mechanisms may facilitate entry of microorganisms with an attendant increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and (c) intensive oral surveillance and prophylactic care should be part of the routine management afforded to AIDS patients soon after HIV-1 infection is recognized.\r"

The WR classification was applied to a cohort of 431 men who were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus on entry into a prospective study. The WR classification was of limited usefulness, as only 133 men (31%) could be assigned to a WR stage. Among men who could be WR classified, only individuals in WR stage 5 were found to have a significantly more rapid progression to AIDS. The seropositive cohort was also classified based on initial CD4 cell number. Low CD4 counts (less than 400 cells/mm3) were significantly associated with progression to AIDS, and grouping seropositive men by CD4 number alone provided as much prognostic information as the WR classification. Skin test anergy was also a significant predictor for progression to AIDS, but only in individuals with low CD4 counts.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the initial experience in hospice care for a predominantly poor, black and Hispanic intravenous drug user AIDS population in New York City. Hospice care was provided in a skilled nursing facility with a certified hospice program delivering home care and inpatient care. A formal education program preceded patient admission to familiarize the staff and institution with AIDS issues. Between February 1986 and January 1988, 62 of 175 referred patients were accepted for hospice admission. The patients' mean age was 39 years and all had AIDS dementia complex. The mean length of stay was 35 days (range 1-280 days) and a total of 2011 days of hospice care was provided. Ninety-one percent of hospice days were spent on the inpatient unit; only 9% of hospice days were provided at home. Despite the requirement of expensive inpatient hospice care for most patient days, the estimated savings in decreased costs compared to acute hospital inpatient care was $751,488 for these 62 patients. Continuing fear of transmission among hospice staff was not a major problem; however, several unanticipated problems arose including (a) inability to provide home services, (b) continued drug abuse, (c) increased staff stress, (d) difficulty maintaining confidentiality, (e) difficult interactions with funeral directors, and (f) unsupportive and inappropriate funding requirements. Hospice care of AIDS patients is feasible, humane, and cost effective but problems of the intravenous drug using population require special attention and program modifications if hospice care is to be provided for this substantial and growing AIDS population.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody prevalence and drug-using behaviors among intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) enrolled in Milwaukee drug treatment programs. Six (2.3%) of 266 study participants were positive for HIV antibody by Western blot assay. A history of needlesharing was reported by 91% of participants, injection of drugs within the past 6 months by 76%, visits to a shooting gallery by 34%, and drug injection outside of Wisconsin by 41%. Nonwhite participants were more likely than white participants to share needles greater than 5 times per month (odds ratio of 2.0) and more likely to have visited a shooting gallery greater than 5 times (odds ratio of 2.7). The average frequency of injection did not differ significantly by race or gender. Pharmacies were the most frequently listed source of sterile needles, and the most common reason for sharing needles was convenience. We conclude that as of late 1987, HIV seroprevalence in Milwaukee IVDAs remained relatively low compared to that of IVDAs in the northeastern United States. There may be racial differences in drug-using behaviors that define distinct subpopulations of IVDAs. These differences should be assessed further, since they have important implications for the success of AIDS education efforts.\r"

Until October 1986, two new seroconversions were detected out of 270 examined (seroconversion rate of 0.74% per year). Further HIV infections have not been detected among the 282 prostitutes followed to 1988. This should be attributed to avoidance of clients from Central Africa and mainly to almost universal use of condoms as a result of the intensive educational campaign.\r"

Among i.v. drug abusers, the prevalence was 32.3% for HIV-1 and 6.6% for HTLV-1. For both viruses, the total figures did not significantly change from 1985 through 1987, accounting for a slow viral circulation in this group. No seropositivity (HIV-1, HTLV-1) was found among laboratory workers, whereas one subject was found seropositive for HIV-1 among household contacts. From 1985 to 1986, 5 out of 58 subjects seronegative for HIV-1 and 5 out of 82 seronegative for HTLV-1 seroconverted (incidence rates of 8.6 and 6.1%, respectively). From 1986 to 1987, none out of 11 seronegatives for HIV and 1 out of 16 seronegatives for HTLV-1 seroconverted. The total figures for hepatitis B markers were 79.2% among IVDAs, 24.4% among household contacts, and 25.6% among laboratory workers. A significant correlation was found between presence of HBV markers and seropositivity for HIV and HTLV-1. A significant association with HIV-1 seropositivity was found for history of sexual intercourse with HIV-1 seropositive partners and for sexual promiscuity. These data emphasize the important role played by sexual behavior in addition to needle-sharing in the spreading of multiple infections among drug abusers.\r"

The demographic, surgical, efficacy and safety variables were statistically similar. Prior to discharge from the hospital, 12 women (5.3%) developed major postoperative pelvic infections that required parenteral antimicrobial therapy; no wound infections occurred. There was no correlation between a depressed antimicrobial development of significant postoperative infection. An expanded spectrum of antibacterial activity and a longer serum half-life did not improve clinical efficacy, and single-dose intravenous cephalosporin prophylaxis before abdominal hysterectomy was associated with a low incidence of pelvic infection.\r"

These measurements were obtained before and after the intermittent clamping sequence, which was carried out for a 24-hour period. No difference in bladder tone was noted when comparing prestudy to poststudy intravesicle pressures. Posturethropexy bladder conditioning failed to improve detrusor tone or bladder function in these patients.\r"

Subjects viewed four videotapes of a 21-year-old male engaged in simulated counseling interviews after he was given drinks containing alcohol to achieve one of four target Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) goals: .00%, .05%, .10%, .15%. Results indicated that alcohol counselors were not uniformly more accurate than mental health therapists, nor were more-experienced alcohol counselors uniformly more accurate than less-experienced alcohol counselors at recognizing intoxication or estimating BAL. In addition, subjects generally underestimated the target's sober-intoxicated status and BAL when he was given alcohol, but almost every subject recognized that the target was at least moderately intoxicated when his BAL was .15%.\r"

Results showed that both treatments improved Block Design performance in abstinent male alcoholics to levels comparable to nonalcoholic controls, while unremediated alcoholics remained significantly impaired. Unstructured practice was sufficient to improve Block Design performance, with no additional advantage evident in alcoholics receiving strategy training. Hence, forced use of cognitive skills appears to be the important factor in experience-dependent recovery.\r"

Using samples of high-school students, the COALES was found to have satisfactory test-retest reliability, internal-consistency reliability and construct and concurrent validity. Children who self-identified as having an alcoholic parent reported higher levels of negative events and lower levels of positive events than did their peers from nonalcoholic homes. Scores on the positive- and negative-event subscales were significantly correlated with the children's scores on measures of anxiety and depression.\r"

These data demonstrate that the taste-rating task conveys implicit \"how to drink\" demands that seem to alter natural drinking topography. Examination of the correspondence between self-report and analogue consumption revealed that preexperimental estimates of typical drinking were significant yet modest predictors of analogue consumption. Moreover, postexperimental estimates of analogue consumption revealed that subjects accurately self-reported laboratory drinking, with taste-rating subjects showing more accuracy. Limitations of taste-rating methodology and directions for further investigation of analogue consumption measures are discussed.\r"

In 1985, 68.5% of employees with medical insurance had coverage for alcoholism treatments and 61.6% had coverage for drug-abuse treatments. Alcoholism coverage increased 89% from 1981 to 1985. The increases were reflected across all regions, firm sizes and occupational groups. Self-insured firms, exempt from mandated coverage laws, had the greatest increase in coverage. HMOs appear to have reduced coverage since 1981. Finally, substance abuse coverages did not appear to be discretionary and, therefore, were unlikely to be eliminated if tax laws on fringe benefits were changed.\r"

Both samples were interviewed using the same questionnaire. Response rates were 72% in the United States and 92% in Mexico. Results show that Mexican-American men drink more frequently than men in Michoacan, who, as a group, drink infrequently but consume more often five or more drinks at a sitting as compared with Mexican Americans. Mexican-American women have a lower rate of abstention and a higher rate of women who drink at least once a week and who consume five drinks at a sitting at least once a year than do women in Michoacan. Among men, changes in drinking seem to occur soon after coming to the United States--often within 5 years. Among women, drinking patterns are not related to length of residence in the United States. In spite of less drinking, respondents in Michoacan report more alcohol problems than do Mexican Americans.\r"

Since heterogeneity within a sample can confound genetic linkage analysis, obscuring linkage relationships, alcoholism was studied in these families as a disorder unrelated to depression or antisocial personality. No allelic associations were found to be significant after allowing for the multiple tests. In a sib-pair linkage analysis, significant differences between the mean proportion of genes identical by descent in concordant and discordant sib pairs were found for the esterase-D (ESD) marker locus (p less than or equal to .01). This suggested that a linkage may exist between a gene for alcoholism and the ESD locus on chromosome 13q. Lod score linkage analysis yielded odds in favor of linkage to ESD of 44 to 1, most of the information relevant to linkage residing in a single family in which three offspring were classified as alcoholic and five were not.\r"

  ".W": "The prevailing sentiment of North American neurosurgeons is that there is no significant difference in overall morbidity between patients who are treated with early aneurysm surgery and those who are treated with delayed aneurysm surgery. This concept is based primarily on the high incidence of ischemic events after early intervention. Recent experience, however, indicates that prophylactic hypervolemic hypertensive therapy may be beneficial in reducing delayed ischemia after early aneurysm surgery. During the preceding 21 months, we have performed 125 operations for intracranial aneurysms. Fifty-six patients in this group presented less than 7 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (47 within 3 days) and were treated by a prospective protocol of urgent aneurysm surgery performed within 24 hours after presentation. In all cases, the aneurysm was clipped with the use of mannitol and spinal drainage for brain relaxation. All patients were then treated with prophylactic volume expansion therapy and induced hypertension with a central venous pressure or a Swan-Ganz catheter until the 14th day after SAH. Preoperatively, 17 patients were Hunt and Hess Grade I, 9 were Grade II, 28 were Grade III, and 2 were Grade IV. In this group of 56 patients at risk for delayed ischemia from vasospasm, 5 patients had significant intraoperative complications. Ten patients (18%) had delayed cerebral ischemia, totally reversible in 6 cases, with small infarcts in 3 cases, and with 1 death (2% mortality from delayed ischemia), there were 5 cases of shunted hydrocephalus, and 3 deaths from other complications. Overall, 41 patients (73%) returned to their premorbid occupations without neurological deficit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study included 11 patients who underwent 12 operations for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The CBF data were analyzed to investigate the neurological state, presence or nonpresence of vasospasm, timing of the operation, and outcome of each patient. Autoregulation disturbance, in terms of reaction to hypotension, was consistently seen in patients in poor neurological states, and this disturbance was correlated with poor outcome. This simple monitoring system, used during emergency operations for ruptured aneurysm, was useful in predicting outcome.\r"

The most common causes are recurrent herniation and postoperative scarring; routine x-ray and myelographic differentiation between herniation and scarring is difficult or impossible. High resolution computed tomography (CT) has shown some results in the evaluation of postoperative patients, but the role of epidural fibrosis in failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is not clear. Some knowledge of the \"normal\" CT physiological healing and scarring after disc surgery is necessary. We scanned 20 asymptomatic operated patients and 20 patients with recurrent sciatic nerve pain after disc surgery who did not have bony stenosis, recurrent disc herniation, or other causes of FBSS. Our observations showed no important differences in the fibrosis demonstrated by CT between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The degree and type of fibrosis are not related to recurrent symptoms.\r"

All patients presented with pain, and 16 (67%) had neurological deficits. Patients were divided into two treatment groups. Thirteen patients treated from 1949 to 1977 usually underwent limited tumor resection and external radiation therapy. The second group, 11 patients treated from 1978 to 1984, underwent more aggressive surgical resection and received combination chemotherapy as well as local radiation to the tumor bed. In the second group, there were 5 long term survivors, and only 1 patient developed metastatic disease while on therapy. Failure to obtain local control was the major cause of treatment failure. Complete surgical resection of the tumor by spondylectomy and combination chemotherapy offer the best prospect for cure of osteogenic sarcoma of the spine.\r"

Histological findings are helpful in recognizing the malignant potential of a given tumor, but often fail to correlate with gross features, liability of recurrence, and extent of associated cerebral edema. To find alternate approaches to improve the correlation between biological and clinical behavior, 20 meningiomas were studied by flow cytometry (FC), an assessment that has been applied to meningiomas previously. Such FC features as DNA index (DI) and proliferative index (PI, %G2 + %S) were correlated with size, location, brain invasion, associated edema, and recurrence. Tumors with severe edema had significantly higher PIs (19.5 +/- 4.1) than those with moderate (12.6 +/- 4.5) or minimal (8 +/- 0) edema (P less than 0.05). The PI was greater than 16 in those tumors that recurred (n = 3) or invaded the brain (n = 3). Six tumors were aneuploid (DI, 1.33 +/- 0.17; PI, 17.1 +/- 5.3). These were uniformly large when compared with the diploid tumors, which were more variable in size. All of the aneuploid tumors were associated with moderate to severe cerebral edema. Two partly psammomatous tumors with high PIs and foci of high cellularity suggesting recent growth were associated with severe edema. One of these exhibited brain invasion. These preliminary data indicate that FC may have a potential use in the clinical management of meningiomas.\r"

Often, however, the metastasis recurs and limits the quality of life and survival of the patient. Once the metastasis recurs, therapeutic options are limited. Brachytherapy delivers a high total dose of radiation to a localized area, allowing reirradiation at the time of recurrence. Three patients with recurrent brain metastases treated with iridium-192 implants are presented; two of these patients had breast carcinoma and one had malignant melanoma. The implants allowed long term survival in the two patients with recurrent metastatic breast carcinoma. Unfortunately, the patient with melanoma did not respond to the brachytherapy and died within 7 months of implantation. The approaches to treatment to metastatic brain tumors and the rationale for using brachytherapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most frequent neurological sequelae seen by the specialist in rehabilitation is the spastic foot. Spasticity in the foot may be responsible for abnormal posture and painful or trophic disturbances impairing standing and walking. This disability can be corrected by a simple neurosurgical procedure, the selective tibial neurotomy. In this procedure, one sections the tibial nerve branches to the muscles sustaining spasticity, i.e., the soleus and/or the gastrocnemius nerves for equinus and ankle clonus or the posterior tibialis branch for varus and the flexor fascicles for tonic flexion of the toes. After microsurgical dissection of each tibial nerve branch at the lower part of the popliteal region and their identification with bipolar electrostimulation, the selected branches are partially sectioned under the operating microscope. The present series consists of 62 operations performed in 53 patients, 9 bilaterally and 44 unilaterally. Operation obtained complete suppression of the disabling spasticity that had been present for 2 to 17 years (4 on average), total pain relief, and consequently improvement of the residual voluntary movements (by achieving a better balance between agonist and antagonist muscles) in 51 of the 62 spastic feet (i.e., 82% of the cases). For all of these patients, the beneficial effects were long-lasting over the 1- to 10-year follow-up (3 years on average). Selective neurotomy of the tibial nerve should be considered only after failure of intensive prolonged kinestherapy and of all available medical treatment. It must take place, however, before the onset of irreversible articular disturbances and musculotendinous retractions, which require complementary orthopedic corrections.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the cardiac mass, isomyosins polymorphism, and collagen network in the left ventricle have been studied in renovascular, hypertensive, spontaneously hypertensive, and normotensive rats. The isoenzyme profile of left ventricular myosins was used as an indirect marker of the intrinsic property of contractility, whereas the collagen network, measured by a morphometric method, represented an indirect structural marker of the arrhythmogenic risk. One-clip, two-kidney renovascular hypertension was associated with cardiac hypertrophy, a shift in the isomyosin profile, and accumulation of collagen within the left ventricular myocardium. In this renin-angiotensin-dependent model, one month of treatment with converting enzyme inhibitor normalized blood pressure and consistently reversed cardiac hypertrophy and the isomyosin profile. Converting enzyme inhibitor treatment of 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats for three months significantly decreased blood pressure but did not completely normalize it. The increase in cardiac mass observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats was not reversed by this short treatment. Nevertheless, the percentage of the V1 form of myosin increased slightly after treatment, and the collagen content of the left ventricle was considerably decreased. Converting enzyme inhibition did not decrease blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension, and no changes were observed in cardiac hypertrophy, isomyosin profile, or the collagen network. The cardiac hypertrophy that occurs with aging in normotensive rats was associated with a significant shift in isomyosin profile and a large accumulation of collagen. Thus, aging mimics several of the quantitative and qualitative changes in the left ventricular protein profile observed in hypertension. In young normotensive rats, converting enzyme inhibition significantly decreased blood pressure and left ventricular mass, increased the percentage of V1 isomyosin, and prevented the accumulation of collagen. In one-year-old normotensive rats, treatment for six months with converting enzyme inhibitor decreased blood pressure, decreased cardiac mass, and prevented the accumulation of collagen; the isomyosin profile was not modified. Converting enzyme inhibition, by acting on cardiac afterload, can bring about quantitative and qualitative changes in the cardiac proteins of both hypertensive and normotensive rats.\r"

This review summarizes the biochemical and molecular changes occurring during progression and with regression of cardiac hypertrophy in rats, humans, and other animals, and focuses on the role played by antihypertensive drugs in modulation of ventricular isomyosins. The implications of these observations for humans remain to be fully determined.\r"

Posterior wall thickness, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass were determined by M-mode echocardiography. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma renin activity was related to 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. Of all the endocrine parameters, only the angiotensin II level correlated with posterior wall thickness (r = 0.50, p less than 0.05) and relative wall thickness (r = 0.46, p less than 0.05). This relationship was confirmed by stepwise multiple regression analysis taking arterial pressure, obesity, and sodium excretion into account (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity but not the angiotensin II level correlated positively with the ejection fraction (r = 0.42, p less than 0.05) and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (r = 0.57, p less than 0.01). Thus, angiotensin II emerged as a determinant of left ventricular structural adaptation in essential hypertension.\r"

Cardiac angiotensin may adversely influence myocardial metabolism and provoke ventricular arrhythmia during ischemia and reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. Local angiotensin may stimulate cardiac contractility. In addition, angiotensin may influence cardiac myocyte growth and may contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. Recent data show that the pharmacologic inhibition of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme may have important therapeutic consequences for the ischemic, hypertrophic, or failing heart.\r"

Therefore, coronary sinus blood flow (gas chromatic argon technique) was determined in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, with or without dilatation, associated with entirely normal coronary arteriographic results: 12 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (left ventricular mass-to-volume ratio, 3.66 +/- 0.52 g/ml), 22 patients with hypertensive heart disease due to essential hypertension (left ventricular mass-to-volume ratio, 2.12 +/- 0.26 g/ml), 18 patients with hypertensive dilatation (left ventricular mass-to-volume ratio, 1.6 +/- 0.48 g/ml), six patients with aortic stenosis (left ventricular mass-to-volume ratio, 1.99 +/- 0.41 g/ml), 12 patients with aortic incompetence, and 20 patients with normal heart function. Coronary sinus blood flow was determined as a control value and as the value following intravenous injection of dipyridamole (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). Coronary reserve was calculated as the ratio of coronary resistance before and after dipyridamole. Normal coronary reserve averaged 4.89 +/- 0.11. Similar values, despite marked left ventricular hypertrophy, were present for both hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (4.4 +/- 0.19) and aortic stenosis (4.66 +/- 0.12), whereas coronary reserve was considerably reduced in the concentrically hypertrophied hypertensive hearts (3.22 +/- 0.19) (p less than 0.001). Moderate decrease in coronary reserve was found in aortic incompetence and in dilated essential hypertension. These results indicate that patients with nonhypertensive hypertrophy, despite left ventricular mass augmentation, may have normal coronary reserve, whereas at a comparable degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, patients with hypertensive hypertrophy have a specific reduction in coronary reserve. Independent from vascular effects, ventricular dilatation may result in deterioration of coronary reserve because of an abnormal component of coronary vascular resistance. These results were also verified in experimental hypertension. Moreover, prevention and/or regression of the impaired coronary circulation in experimental hypertensive heart disease, most probably due to the reduction of smooth muscle layers of the media of coronary resistance vessels, could be achieved by long-term vasodilator therapy.\r"

Their primary evolutionary role may be a response to the extreme stress of hemorrhage. Derangements of reflex control may lead to adverse effects on organ blood flow, particularly renal blood flow; adjustments appropriate for support of the circulation during hemorrhage may be inappropriate in congestive heart failure. The balance between one control system and another may be altered by disease. Arterial baroreflex control of the circulation is impaired in hypertension, but may be partially compensated by increased gain in cardiopulmonary reflexes. Changes in autonomic balance in acute myocardial ischemia may be important in the mechanism of sudden death. Physical training can favorably modify arterial baroreflex function and adds to the evidence in favor of active rehabilitation after infarction.\r"

Striking decreases in stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal impairment have been observed when blood pressure is reduced. However, the ability of traditional, diuretic-first, stepped-care therapeutic algorithms to reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction or angina has been exceedingly difficult to demonstrate. An increased frequency of sudden death among hypertensive men with electrocardiographic abnormalities has been observed in some diuretic-based treatment trials. The failure of conventional therapy to reduce coronary artery disease and death has forced a re-appraisal of antihypertensive treatment. The risk factors for coronary disease are reviewed in detail with an emphasis on the impact of various classes of antihypertensive drugs on these factors. The emergence of effective antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure without adversely affecting cardiovascular risk factors provides a new opportunity to further extend the benefit of treatment by reducing such risk.\r"

Verzella later introduced the concept of clear lensectomy with low-power implants for the correction of myopia. Although phakic myopic intraocular lenses were tried and abandoned in the 1950s, it is my contention that this modality should be reconsidered.
