Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBL) of healthy adults were IL2-cultured for 72 h either together with a gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-28 or with phytohemagglutinin, then IL2-cultured for another 11 days. Cytotoxicity of the MKN-28 precultured lymphocytes against MKN-28 was particularly increased. Presence during preculture or during cytotoxicity assay of sera from gastric cancer patients having the same histological type as MKN-28 suppressed the cytotoxicity. However, the serum suppressive effect on cytotoxicity of the IL2-cultured lymphocytes was far milder than that on PBL cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Although increasing use is being made of arterial grafts (the internal mammary arteries) for direct myocardial revascularization, it is frequently not possible to reach the posterior surface of the heart with the internal mammary as either a pedicle or a free graft. Since June 1984 we have used the right gastroepiploic artery in nine patients as a pedicle graft to the distal right coronary artery (four patients), the posterior descending artery (three patients), and the distal circumflex branches (two patients). Eight patients survived the operation. Celiac axis opacification confirmed patency in six and coronary angiography strongly suggested patency in the remaining two. All survivors are functionally in New York Heart Association Class I or II. The early angiographic and clinical results demonstrate the feasibility of using the right gastroepiploic artery as a bypass graft to coronary vessels on the posterior surface of the heart when traditional conduits are unsuitable. If its long-term patency as a living arterial graft is similar to that of the internal mammary arteries, the gastroepiploic artery may become the coronary bypass graft of choice for the distal right coronary and circumflex systems.\r"

  ".W": "The phenomenon of a pressure gradient between central and radial arteries was evaluated in 48 patients immediately after coronary artery bypass operations. All were in stable hemodynamic condition, none receiving catecholamine support. In eight patients (Group A) mean femoral pressure was significantly higher than mean radial pressure (range 10 to 30 mm Hg). In the remaining 40 (Group B) radial and femoral pressures were equal. Mean cardiac index (thermodilution) was 3.3 +/- 0.68 versus 2.1 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2, systemic vascular resistance 1,181 +/- 218.4 versus 2,049 +/- 501 dynes/sec/cm-5, toe temperature 23.8 degrees +/- 1.2 degrees C versus 24.02 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C, core temperature 33.9 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C versus 34.1 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C, mixed venous oxygen saturation 78% +/- 3% versus 62% +/- 5%, and peak radial dP/dt 1,485 +/- 366 versus 2,028 +/- 392 in Groups A and B, respectively. These data indicate, first, that the low radial pressures measured in Group A patients did not represent the true central aortic pressures; that is, they were false. Second, these low pressures had nothing to do with compromised cardiac function; rather, they were due to peripheral constriction and volume factors and also probably to proximal shunting. It is therefore recommended that while the chest is still open, if a discrepancy exists between a low radial artery pressure, a high palpable aortic pressure, and a satisfactory cardiac contraction, a femoral cannula for pressure measurement should be inserted. Treatment is by blood infusion until the femoral-radial gradient has been abolished.\r"

The isolates were identified as HIVs by antigenic cross-reactivity and nucleic acid hybridizations to HIV-specific antibodies and DNA probes. The replication and cytopathic properties of these isolates were studied and compared with lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HIVLAV). All isolates had replication competence equivalent to LAV, but four isolates did not kill T4 (CD-4) cells. This isolation of non-cytocidal natural variants of HIV raises the possibility that in some AIDS cases the neurological disorders might be due to HIV variants that are non-cytocidal to T4 cells. The results also indicate that virus replication and cytotoxicity are not always concordant functions in HIV.\r"

The results were compared with those for 115 healthy controls. The exposed subjects showed significantly more body sway, estimated as movement of the centre of gravity in the horizontal plane, than the controls. This swaying correlated poorly with the recalled level of noise exposure, though subjects with more severe hearing loss (by audiometric deterioration of high-frequency sound, 4 kHz and 6 kHz) showed more sway than those with less severe hearing loss. Age was not significantly correlated with body sway among the controls but men seemed to sway more than women. These results suggest subclinical disturbance of the vestibular system among subjects with impulse-noise-induced hearing loss.\r"

The prevalence of CMV antibodies was higher in the surgical group than in the control group (90% and 74%, respectively), and a significantly greater percentage (p less than 0.001) of surgical cases than controls had high titres of CMV antibodies (57% and 26%, respectively). Small but not significant differences in antibodies to HSV1 were observed, and there were no differences in HSV2 antibody titres. For each virus there was no correlation between antibody titre and blood levels of total cholesterol or triglycerides. It is suggested that periodically activated virus may have a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\r"

Owing to its coagulation properties, the laser was used effectively in treating patients with oral lesions compounded by blood dyscrasias. Because of the advantages of a relatively bloodless surgery; decreased postoperative discomfort; minimal swelling and scarring; and the laser's ability to coagulate, vaporize, or cut, the CO2 surgical laser offers the dental surgeon a viable and in many cases an improved alternative to the scalpel. Laser techniques and several case reports are discussed.\r"

The reduction in transmitter release was accompanied by an increased variability in the latency between the presynaptic spike and the release of transmitter. The aminoglycoside antibiotics amikacin, gentamycin, and bekanamycin, when applied at concentrations within their therapeutic levels, markedly enhanced the blockade of transmitter release in BoTx-poisoned junctions. 3,4-diaminopyridine strongly antagonized the effects of BoTx at early stages of poisoning, and the combined presynaptic effects of BoTx and aminoglycoside antibiotics provided that transmitter release was not completely blocked by the toxin. The antagonism was apparent at all frequencies of stimulation. Since the aminoglycoside antibiotics enhanced the neuromuscular block caused by BoTx, these drugs should be avoided in patients suspected of poisoning by this toxin.\r"

Each patient first received a single intravenous dose; 48 hours later a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion of the agent was begun. The doses used were 1.3 X 10(3) (n = 4), 2.6 X 10(3) (n = 4), 5.2 X 10(3) (n = 4), 1.0 X 10(4) (n = 3), or 2.0 X 10(4) (n = 1) U per kilogram of body weight per day. Administration of recombinant GM-CSF resulted in dose-dependent increases in circulating leukocytes and in increases in circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. The peak leukocyte count ranged from 4575 +/- 2397 cells per microliter at the lowest dose, to 48,700 in the patient receiving the highest dose. Mild side effects--low-grade fever, myalgia, phlebitis, and flushing--were observed in some patients; there were no life-threatening toxic reactions. Our data demonstrate that recombinant human GM-CSF is well tolerated and biologically active in leukopenic patients with AIDS. Strategies to increase the number and function of circulating leukocytes may reduce the morbidity and mortality of infections in these and other patients with leukopenia.\r"

  ".W": "Myeloma cells destroy bone by producing an osteoclast-stimulating factor that has chemical and biological characteristics similar to the bone-resorbing activity present in the supernatants of activated leukocyte cultures. Recently, a number of bone-resorbing leukocyte cytokines have been identified, including interleukin-1, lymphotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor. We have examined the products of human myeloma cells for the presence of these bone-resorbing cytokines. In a tumor cell line derived from a patient who had myeloma with osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia, we found that the myeloma cells induced bone-resorbing activity and cytotoxic activity in vitro. Most of the bone-resorbing activity and all cytotoxic activity were suppressed by neutralizing antibodies to lymphotoxin. The myeloma cells expressed both lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor mRNA, but no tumor necrosis factor could be detected in the cell-culture medium. Interleukin-1 mRNA was not detected in the myeloma cells, and biologic activity of interleukin-1 was not measurable in the medium harvested from the cultured cells. The bone-resorbing activity induced by recombinant tumor necrosis factor and recombinant interleukin-1 was not affected by treatment with the lymphotoxin antibodies. When lymphotoxin was infused subcutaneously into normal mice (10 micrograms per day for three days), their plasma calcium levels increased. We also evaluated four established cell lines derived from three other patients with myeloma, and found a similar pattern of lymphotoxin expression in each. It appears that production of the bone-resorbing cytokine lymphotoxin is related to osteoclastic bone destruction and hypercalcemia in patients with myeloma.\r"

Simian T-lymphotropic virus type III (simian immodeficiency virus) from macaques (STLV-IIIMAC) induces symptoms similar to those of AIDS in infected macaques, but isolates from African green monkeys (STLV-IIIAGM) and mangabeys (STLV-IIMM) appear to be non-pathogenic in these animals. A human virus immunologically related to STLV-IIIAGM (HTLV-IV), reported to have been isolated from healthy humans, has been shown to be almost identical to STLV-IIIAGM, which has called into question the independent origin of these viruses. Here we report the complete DNA sequence of STLV-IIIAGM and analyse its relationship with the genomes of the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1, HIV-2ROD (previously called LAV-2) and several ungulate lentiretroviruses. STLV-IIIAGM and HIV-2 are closely related, and more distantly related to HIV-1.\r"

  ".W": "That the sporadic and inherited forms of a particular cancer could both result from mutations in the same gene was first proposed by Knudson. He further proposed that these mutations act recessively at the cellular level, and that both copies of the gene must be lost for the cancer to develop. In sporadic cases both events occur somatically whereas in dominant familial cases susceptibility is inherited through a germline mutation and the cancer develops after a somatic change in the homologous allele. This model has since been substantiated in the case of retinoblastoma, Wilms tumour, acoustic neuroma and several other tumours, in which loss of heterozygosity was shown in tumour material compared to normal tissue from the same patient. The dominantly inherited disorder, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP, also called familial polyposis coli), which gives rise to multiple adenomatous polyps in the colon that have a relatively high probability of progressing to a malignant adenocarcinoma, provides a basis for studying recessive genes in the far more common colorectal carcinomas using this approach. Following a clue as to the location of the FAP gene given by a case report of an individual with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q, who had FAP and multiple developmental abnormalities, we have examined sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas for loss of alleles on chromosome 5. Using a highly polymorphic 'minisatellite' probe which maps to chromosome 5q we have shown that at least 20% of this highly heterogeneous set of tumours lose one of the alleles present in matched normal tissue. This parallels the assignment of the FAP gene to chromosome 5 (see accompanying paper) and suggests that becoming recessive for this gene may be a critical step in the progression of a relatively high proportion of colorectal cancers.\r"

  ".U": "87287282\r", 
  ".W": "The growth of normal diploid fibroblasts is generally thought to be tightly controlled by exogenous growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Subversion of a growth factor pathway at a regulatory point is considered to be a key event in neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis. Thus, simian sarcoma virus has acquired the gene encoding the B-chain of PDGF and there is direct experimental proof that SSV-transformation is mediated by a PDGF-like growth factor. There is accumulating evidence that PDGF-like molecules are also synthesized and released by certain normal cells, suggesting an important role of cellularly produced PDGF in development and tissue regeneration. We now present evidence that a transient expression of the gene encoding the PDGF A-chain, and the synthesis and release of functional A-chain homodimers, is an early event in the prereplicative phase of normal human foreskin fibroblasts exposed to PDGF or EGF. Since these cells are PDGF-responsive, the results imply the existence of a positive autocrine signal that may serve as an amplifier of the mitogenic response under certain conditions.\r"

The purpose of the present experiment was to assess the value of direct current stimulation for enhancing the recovery of spinal cord function after clip compression injury of the rat spinal cord. Twenty Wistar rats underwent a 1-minute, 50-g clip compression injury at T-1, after which electrodes were placed epidurally with the anode proximal and the cathode distal to the injury site. These electrodes were attached to a stimulator implanted subcutaneously. Ten animals received stimulators that produced a constant current of 14 microA, and the remainder received stimulators with no electrical output and served as controls. Assignment of stimulators was random, and the treatment group was not identified until sacrifice. Neurological function was tested weekly for 15 weeks by the inclined plane technique, after which the animals were killed and the injured cords were examined for histological evidence of regeneration. The mean inclined plane result for the treatment group (39 +/- 5 degrees) was significantly better than that for the control group (31 +/- 6 degrees) (P less than 0.02), although there was no significant difference in histological findings between the two groups. Thus, direct current stimulation of the injured mammalian spinal cord produced improvement in neurological function and warrants further investigation.\r"

We report nine children who developed second episodes of disease 1 week or more after receiving rifampin prophylaxis. The median interval between the last dose of rifampin and admission to the hospital for the second episode was 70 days (range, 9 to 138). Analysis of biotypes and outer membrane protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of paired isolates from eight cases revealed that the second episodes in two of the children were caused by acquisition of new type b Haemophilus strains, whereas the second episodes in the remaining six children were caused by isolates which were indistinguishable from the respective isolates from the first episodes. Rifampin prophylaxis of the index patient may prevent some episodes of recurrent disease. However, in some patients who have received prophylaxis, second episodes can occur, probably as a result of reacquisition of the organism from contacts who did not receive rifampin or from acquisition of new type b strains.\r"

Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae biotype 2 predominated in CJ-AOM; however, Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated nearly as frequently as H. influenzae in conjunctivitis without AOM. Younger age (P = 0.001) and more episodes of AOM in the previous year (P = 0.006) were risk factors for CJ-AOM. Persistence of AOM was frequently observed in CJ-AOM. The frequency of AOM secondary to conjunctivitis was reduced (P = .01) in amoxicillin recipients (2 of 41) compared with placebo (11 of 42), but amoxicillin failed to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae. More episodes of AOM per year (P less than 0.001) and day care (P less than 0.001) were found to be risk factors for AOM secondary to conjunctivitis.\r"

Eighty-five children were evaluated in a prospective, double-blind, randomized fashion. Postvaccination antibody concentrations (measured by radioimmunoassay) and response rates were not significantly different between the two manufacturers' vaccines but immunogenicity was significantly less in 18-month-old children (antibody concentration, 0.149 microgram/ml) compared with 24-month-old children (0.838 microgram/ml) (P = 0.001). No significant differences were noted in the safety of the two vaccines. This study suggests that previously observed differences of immunogenicity data between various type b capsular polysaccharide vaccines are due to differences in antibody assays, not in vaccines. Eighteen-month-old children appear to have a relatively poor immune response to type b capsular polysaccharide. Therefore to optimize the benefits of immunization, we suggest children receive this vaccine at 24 months of age.\r"

The vast majority of adverse reactions were benign. Because there are many biases that result in the reporting of or failure to report an adverse reaction, it is not possible to derive a rate of reactions from these data.

We identified 31 patients with unsuspected Hib bacteremia and 19 with unsuspected Hib antigenemia and sterile blood cultures. Bacteremic patients were typically under two years of age (81%), had high fevers (mean = 39.5 degrees C), and frequently had otitis media (65%) diagnosed as their only focus of infection at presentation. Nineteen of 31 were empirically treated with oral antibiotics. Ten of 31 (32%) developed focal infectious complications consisting of meningitis (n = 7), cellulitis (n = 2), and pneumonia (n = 1). Children with focal infectious complications differed from those without infectious complications in having a significantly higher mean fever of 40.3 degrees C compared to 39.7 degrees C (P less than 0.05). Five of 19 (26%) empirically treated patients developed focal complications (all meningitis) compared to five of 12 (42%) untreated patients. Blood cultures at follow-up visit were positive in three of 19 (9%) treated patients and seven of 12 (42%) untreated patients (P less than 0.05). Of the 19 children with antigenemia and sterile blood cultures, 16 (84%) were empirically treated with antibiotics, and none had positive blood cultures or focal infections on follow-up evaluation. Children with occult Hib bacteremia are at high risk for developing serious focal infections, particularly meningitis, despite empiric antibiotic therapy. Once Hib bacteremia is suspected, strong consideration should be given to parenteral in hospital antibiotic therapy. The utility of rapid antigen detection for identifying high-risk patients requires further evaluation.\r"

The enhancer stimulates both the homologous alpha 2 type I [alpha 2(I)] collagen promoter and the heterologous early simian virus 40 promoter. In transient expression experiments, enhancer-dependent transcription from the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter utilizes the same transcriptional start site as the one used in the endogenous alpha 2(I) collagen gene. The enhancer activates transcription at a distance of at least 3 kilobase pairs from the transcriptional start site. The alpha 2(I) collagen enhancer displays cell specificity, since it is functional in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but completely inactive in a lymphoid cell line, in contrast to two immunoglobulin gene enhancers that show the opposite behavior. We find several areas of sequence homology with viral enhancers, particularly the enhancer of simian virus 40.\r"

This includes the complete sequence of the amino-terminal tryptic fragment of 290 residues comprising the von Willebrand factor-binding domain. Two primary sets of overlapping fragments were obtained by cleavage of the S-carboxymethylated protein at methionyl and lysyl bonds following treatment with cyanogen bromide and Achromobacter protease I, respectively. Additional fragments were obtained by treatment of native glycocalicin with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and Serratia marcescens protease. Analysis of all these fragments provided data that allowed determination of the continuous sequence corresponding to approximately half of the alpha-chain polypeptide. This region of glycoprotein Ib is largely hydrophobic and contains only two N-linked and one O-linked carbohydrate chains. A hydrophilic region exists between residues 215 and 299, which contains a cluster of 10 negatively charged residues at 269-287. This area is likely to attract positively charged molecules. The hydrophilic, highly glycosylated (at serine and threonine residues) region corresponding to the previously described \"macroglycopeptide\" and representing the carboxyl-terminal half of the alpha chain is likely to begin at residue 292. The determined sequence of the alpha chain of glycoprotein Ib contains a region (residues 29-193) with seven repeats, which is indicative of gene duplication and is highly homologous to human leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein. This protein sequence agrees completely with that deduced from the cDNA sequence reported by Lopez et al. [Lopez, J.A., Chung, D.W., Fujikawa, K., Hagen, F.S., Papayannopoulou, T. & Roth, G.J.

  ".W": "Recent studies have focused on the potential role of transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) as an immunoregulatory peptide. In this context, we demonstrate that TGF-beta is a potent chemoattractant for human peripheral blood monocytes. At concentrations from 0.1 to 10 pg/ml, TGF-beta induces directed monocyte migration in vitro. Consistent with this observation is the expression of high-affinity TGF-beta receptors on the monocytes with a Kd of 1-10 pM. At higher concentrations of TGF-beta (greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml), monocytes are stimulated to generate biologically active mediator(s) that enhance fibroblast growth. Gene expression for one of these growth factors, interleukin 1, is induced in monocytes within hours after exposure to TGF-beta. Thus, TGF-beta may provide an important signal for monocyte recruitment and for regulation of their synthesis of mediators of fibroblast growth and activity in wound healing.\r"

  ".W": "A genomic DNA library prepared from the kidney of the mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi was screened with mouse probes representing major histocompatibility complex genes that encode alpha and beta polypeptide chains of class II molecules (alpha and beta genes). Restriction maps were constructed for the cross-hybridizing clones, and the class II genes borne by these clones were identified. By this procedure, five main regions containing class II genes were established. One region contained four genes and two gene fragments, the second region contained two genes, the third region contained one gene and one gene fragment, and the remaining two regions contained one gene each. Altogether, six beta genes, two alpha genes, and three alpha-gene fragments were identified. Two of the genes (one alpha and one beta) were established as belonging to the DQ subclass, and all other genes were found to be members of the DP subclass. (Subclass designations are based on the human HLA class II genes). No genes belonging to the DR and DO (DZ) subclasses were found in the library. The absence of DR genes in S. ehrenbergi was also indicated when other experimental methods were used. At least some of the DP loci are polymorphic and most likely also functional. Thus, in the evolution of the mole rat, the DR (and probably also the DO) loci have been deleted and their function(s) has been taken over by the DP loci, which have expanded to a great extent. These findings argue for functional interchangeability of the individual subclasses of class II loci.\r"

By utilizing an EBV-negative BL (BJAB) and several EBV-positive sublines derived from it by in vitro infection, it was possible to show that the presence of the virus was associated with altered expression and copy number of MYC. In the EBV-negative BJAB line, the level of MYC transcripts declined progressively as cells approached the stationary phase of growth. In contrast, in EBV-infected BJAB cells MYC expression remained elevated as cells entered stationary phase. This effect on MYC expression was reversibly linked to the presence of the virus. Furthermore, following EBV infection of BJAB cells by two different strains of EBV, amplification of MYC in association with the appearance of a homogeneously staining region on chromosome 8 at the mapped location of MYC had occurred. These studies suggest that both the deregulation of MYC transcription and the chromosomal rearrangement in the region of the MYC locus in this B-cell line may have occurred as a result of EBV infection.\r"

  ".U": "87289701\r", 
  ".W": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common genetic disorder due to defective 21-hydroxylation of steroid hormones. The human P450XXIA2 gene encodes cytochrome P450c21 [steroid 21-monooxygenase (steroid 21-hydroxylase), EC 1.14.99.10], which mediates 21-hydroxylation. The P450XXIA2 gene may be distinguished from the duplicated P450XXIA1 pseudogene by cleavage with the restriction endonuclease Taq I, with the XXIA2 gene characterized by a 3.7-kilobase (kb) fragment and the XXIA1 pseudogene characterized by a 3.2-kb fragment. Restriction endonuclease mapping by several laboratories has suggested that deletion of the P450XXIA2 gene occurs in about 25% of patients with CAH, as their genomic DNA lacks detectable 3.7-kb Taq I fragments. We have cloned human P450c21 cDNA and used it to study genomic DNA prepared from 51 persons in 10 families, each of which includes 2 or more persons with CAH. After Taq I digestion, apparent deletions are seen in 7 of the 20 alleles of the probands; using EcoRI, apparent deletions are seen in 9 of the 20 alleles. However, the apparently deleted alleles seen with Taq I do not coincide with those seen with EcoRI. Furthermore, studies with Bgl II, EcoRI, Kpn I, and Xba I yield normal patterns with at least two enzymes in all cases. Since all probands yielded normal patterns with at least two of the five enzymes used, we conclude that the P450XXIA2 gene \"deletions\" widely reported in CAH patients probably represent gene conversions, unequal crossovers, or polymorphisms rather than simple gene deletions.\r"

We have now found that these cells express T-cell receptor proteins on their surface. Our observations further indicate that the expression of the Thy-1 antigen does not correlate with the expression of alpha-chain and beta-chain T-cell receptor polypeptides. Interestingly, T-cell receptor gamma-chain RNA expression may be influenced or correlate with Thy-1 molecular expression. These studies indicate unusual relationships of different cell-surface structures that may reflect unexpected developmental programs.\r"

By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized this gene to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, IL-3 was found to be deleted in the 5q-chromosome of one patient with refractory anemia who had a del(5)(q15q33.3), of three patients with refractory anemia (two patients) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) de novo who had a similar distal breakpoint [del(5)(q13q33.3)], and of a fifth patient, with therapy-related ANLL, who had a similar distal breakpoint in band q33 [del(5)(q14q33.3)]. Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids retaining the normal or the deleted chromosome 5 from two patients with the refractory anemia 5q- syndrome indicated that IL-3 sequences were absent form the hybrids retaining the deleted chromosome 5 but not from hybrids that had a cytologically normal chromosome 5. Thus, a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-3, GM-CSF (the gene encoding granulocyte-macrophage-CSF), CSF-1 (the gene encoding macrophage-CSF), and FMS (the human c-fms protooncogene, which encodes the CSF-1 receptor). Our findings and earlier results indicating that GM-CSF, CSF-1, and FMS were deleted in the 5q-chromosome, suggest that loss of IL-3 or of other CSF genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders associated with a del(5q).\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative 2-deoxy[14C]glucose autoradiographic method was used to map the distribution of alterations in local cerebral glucose utilization that accompanies clinically effective chronic L-dopa therapy of rhesus monkeys made parkinsonian by the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). This pattern of changes was compared to the effects of a similar treatment regimen in normal monkeys. L-Dopa (100 mg with 10 mg carbidopa) was administered orally to normal and parkinsonian monkeys 3 times daily for 60-120 days prior to measurement of local cerebral glucose utilization. In parkinsonian monkeys treated with L-dopa, signs and symptoms of parkinsonism were controlled or suppressed, and widespread increases in glucose utilization were seen throughout the brain. Cerebral metabolic activity was increased both in areas rich in dopaminergic receptors, such as the caudate and putamen, and in nondopaminergic areas involved in motor functions. In many structures the rates of glucose utilization in L-dopa-treated parkinsonian monkeys were increased to levels that far exceeded rates measured in normal monkeys. In sharp contrast, similar treatment with L-dopa in normal monkeys had little if any effect on local cerebral glucose utilization. L-Dopa, then, appears to have an action in animals with selective lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta produced by MPTP that is distinctly different from its effects in the normal monkey.\r"

The accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was evaluated for this purpose. Multiphasic electrocardiographically gated MR imaging examinations were performed in 25 patients with a total of 72 grafts. Transverse images of the heart at ten anatomic levels were obtained at five or six phases of the cardiac cycle. The MR images were read blindly to determine CABG patency versus occlusion, and these results were compared with those of coronary angiography performed within 2 months before the MR imaging. MR imaging correctly disclosed 43 patent grafts and 13 occluded grafts (predictive accuracy, 78%). Patency and occlusion were incorrectly diagnosed from MR imaging findings in five and four CABGs, respectively. CABG status could not be determined in seven (10%) grafts because the grafts were visualized at only one anatomic level. Thus, the accuracy of a definitive MR imaging evaluation was 91% (43 of 47 grafts) for patency determination and 72% (13 of 18 grafts) for occlusion determination. MR imaging appears to be a useful method for the noninvasive evaluation of CABGs.\r"

The effect of the pericardium on pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures, and on systemic arterial pressure was not significant. Central venous pressure increased from 8 +/- 2 mmHg to 9 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.05) after pericardial closure and decreased to 7 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.05) when the pericardium was reopened. Left ventricular end-diastolic cavity diameter by echocardiography decreased in 19 of the patients studied from 46 +/- 6 mm to 41 +/- 5 mm (p less than 0.01) when the pericardium was closed, and increased to 45 +/- 6 mm (p less than 0.01) after re-opening of the pericardiotomy incision.

Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of such blood were obtained from the suction reservoir in 20 cases 2, 4 and 6 hours postoperatively. The results were negative, apart from Staphylococcus albus in one 6-hour sample. The blood, which was in some degree hemolyzed, contained acceptable amounts of red cells and albumin. Alterations of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems indicated massive proteolysis with degradation of the proteins to an extent that precluded coagulation. This proteolysis had taken place in the mediastinum, resulting in total defibrinogenation of the blood. The authors conclude that in about one-fourth of cases in cardiac surgery, postoperatively shed blood is worth saving for red cell and volume substitution.\r"

In the 16 patients the mean CSF-AK was substantially increased (0.122 U/l) and the psychometric performance distinctly impaired (-12 points) postoperatively; in the 81 patients the figures were 0.55 U/l and -3.4. Psychometrically, 60% of the patients showed cerebral dysfunction, which was pronounced in 16%. CSF-AK analysis indicated cerebral damage as absent or trival in 45%, moderate in 33% and marked in 22%. CT revealed postoperative cerebral infarction in two cases. Results from the various methods showed reasonable correlation, but also considerable overlap. Open-heart surgery thus can cause brain damage additional to that neurologically discernible. Fatigue is an important sign in this context. In research on postoperative brain damage, the relative insensitivity of routine neurologic investigation calls for supplementary, refined methods.\r"

When the animals were evaluated 4 weeks later, human alpha 1AT was detected in both sera and the epithelial surface of the lungs. The transplanted clone of fibroblasts could be recovered from the peritoneal cavities of those mice and demonstrated to still be producing human alpha 1AT.

  ".W": "The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 contains at least eight genes, of which three (sor, R, and 3' orf) have no known function. In this study, the role of the sor gene was examined by constructing a series of proviral genomes of HIV-1 that either lacked the coding sequences for sor or contained point mutations in sor. Analysis of four such mutants revealed that although each clone could generate morphologically normal virus particles upon transfection, the mutant viruses were limited in their capacity to establish stable infection. Virus derived from transfection of Cos-1 cells (OKT4-) with sor mutant proviral DNA's was resistant to transmission to OKT4+ \"susceptible\" cells under cell-free conditions, and was transmitted poorly by coculture. In contrast, virus derived from clones with an intact sor frame was readily propagated by either approach. Normal amounts of gag-, env-, and pol-derived proteins were produced by all four mutants and assays in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells indicated that their trans-activating capacity was intact and comparable with wild type. Thus the sor gene, although not absolutely required in HIV virion formation, influences virus transmission in vitro and is crucial in the efficient generation of infectious virus. The data also suggest that sor influences virus replication at a novel, post-translational stage and that its action is independent of the regulatory genes tat and trs.\r"

  ".W": "Local presentation of autoantigen by organ-resident cells inappropriately expressing Ia determinants has been implicated in organ-specific autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, induced in rats by immunization with retinal soluble antigen, is used as a model of organ-specific autoimmunity. In an in vitro system derived from this model, uveitogenic rat T-helper lymphocytes specific to the retinal soluble antigen, or control T-helper lymphocytes reactive to the purified protein derivative of tuberculin, were cocultured with Ia-expressing syngeneic retinal glial cells (Muller cells) in the presence of specific antigen. Antigen presentation was not apparent under ordinary culture conditions, and the Muller cells profoundly suppressed the proliferative response of primed T-helper lymphocytes to antigen presented on conventional antigen-presenting cells, as well as their subsequent interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent expansion. Suppression of proliferation was accompanied by inhibition of IL-2 production in response to antigen, as well as by reduction in high-affinity IL-2 receptor expression, and proceeded via a contact-dependent mechanism. These results suggest a role for locally acting suppression mechanisms in immune regulation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of human recombinant beta-interleukin-1 (IL-1) on adrenocortical stimulation was investigated. This study asked three questions: Does IL-1 increase the corticosterone levels of rat serum? Is there a direct effect on the adrenal cortex? What is the mechanism of this effect? The intraperitoneal injection of IL-1 (70 micrograms) in anesthetized male Fisher rats resulted in elevated corticosterone levels at 30 minutes and reached a maximum at 180 minutes (94 +/- 12 versus 34 +/- 4 micrograms/dl, p less than 0.01). Next, the adrenal glands from separate animals were perfused in situ. Corticosterone secretion was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) 90 minutes after a single arterial bolus of 35 micrograms of IL-1. The response to IL-1 was dose dependent, beginning at 3.5 micrograms and reaching a maximum at 35 micrograms. The addition of indomethacin (3 mumol/L) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of IL-1. This study demonstrates that IL-1 increases rat serum corticosterone levels, IL-1 directly stimulates the adrenal cortex, and the stimulation may be mediated through prostaglandin synthesis. This is the first evidence that IL-1 has a direct stimulatory effect on the adrenal cortex.\r"

  ".W": "Although major tissue trauma produces profound depression of cell-mediated immunity, it is not known whether surgical trauma (i.e., midline laparotomy) has any adverse effect on the antigen presentation function and membrane interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity of peritoneal macrophages. To study this, C3H/HEJ (endotoxin-tolerant) mice were anesthetized. An approximately 1-inch midline abdominal incision was made, followed by abdominal closure. On days 1, 3, 5, and 7, peritoneal macrophages were harvested by means of peritoneal lavage, and antigen presentation capability was tested by incubating various numbers of peritoneal macrophages with 2 X 10(4) D10.G4.1 cells per well in the presence of conalbumin (400 micrograms/ml). The T helper cell clone (D.10.G4.1) proliferates on recognition of conalbumin in the context of Iak and also proliferates in the presence of membrane-bound IL-1 plus concanavalin A. To measure membrane IL-1 expression in peritoneal macrophages, Concanavalin A (10 micrograms/ml) was substituted for conalbumin. Cultures were incubated for 72 hours, pulsed with tritiated thymidine, and harvested. Peritoneal macrophages from laparotomized mice induced significantly less T helper cell proliferation on days 1 and 3 in the antigen presentation assay (37% and 30%, respectively; p less than 0.05) and in the membrane IL-1 assay (14% and 10%, respectively; p less than 0.05) as compared with the control. This difference was not detectable on day 5. More effective antigen presentation capability (167% of control; p less than 0.05) was seen on day 7. Thus laparotomy by itself produces marked depression of both antigen presentation function and membrane IL-1 activity of peritoneal macrophages, which may enhance susceptibility to intra-abdominal sepsis.\r"

Large numbers of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells can be generated in vitro by growth in high concentrations of interleukin-2 (IL-2), but relatively few arrive at the tumor site after intravenous injection. We hypothesize that the delivery of LAK cells to tumor sites may be augmented by previously demonstrated lymphocyte-recruiting factors, including activated macrophage products such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor. 111Indium-labeled LAK cells were injected intravenously into syngeneic mice bearing the macrophage activator endotoxin (LPS) in one hind footpad, and saline solution was injected into the contralateral footpad. Significantly more activity was recovered from the LPS-bearing footpad at all times during a 96-hour period. Recombinant IL-1 also attracted more LAK cells after injection into tumor-free hind footpads. Furthermore, LAK cells preferentially homed to hind footpads that were bearing 3-day established sarcomas after intralesional injections of LPS, IL-1, or tumor necrosis factor when compared with contralateral tumor-bearing footpads injected with saline solution alone. In preliminary experiments, mice with hind-footpad tumors appeared to survive longer after combined systemic IL-2 and LAK therapy if intralesional LPS was administered. These studies demonstrate that macrophage activation factors that have been shown capable of attracting circulating normal lymphocytes can also effectively attract LAK cells from the circulation. By the stimulation of macrophages at the sites of tumor growth, more LAK cells can be attracted. It is hoped that by \"focusing\" the migration of LAK cells to tumors, LAK cells and IL-2 would effect tumor regression more efficiently and with less toxicity.\r"

Cimetidine (10(-4) mol/L to 10(-6) mol/L) increased IL-2 production to a maximal 8.8 +/- 1.6 U (IL-2 activity), as compared with media controls of 1 U. Ranitidine (10(-4) mol/L to 10(-6) mol/L) also increased IL-2 production to a maximal 5.6 +/- 1.2 U, as compared with media controls of 1 U. The increases for both drugs were statistically significant- (p at least less than 0.03 for all doses tested). These data suggest that our previously demonstrated immunofacilitation of proliferative and cytotoxic lymphocyte responses by cimetidine was probably mediated by the presence of increased IL-2. These data further suggest that histamine type-2 receptor antagonists may have immunorestorative potential in clinical immunotherapy of IL-2 deficient states.\r"

Twenty-four hours later animals showed a greater than 95% depletion of Thy1.2 cells in peripheral blood and spleen. Thirty control mice received nonspecific rat immunoglobulin (1 mg). Twenty-four hours after treatment mice underwent a 2.5 cm dorsal skin incision with subcutaneous placement of polyvinyl alcohol sponges. Injections were repeated at weekly intervals. Wound healing was assessed at 2, 3, and 4 weeks by the breaking strength of wound strips and by the hydroxyproline content of sponge granulomas (an index of wound reparative collagen deposition). Thy1.2 depletion at death was 95% to 57% in peripheral blood and 86% to 68% in the spleen. Both groups gained weight equally. We found that T cell depletion significantly impairs wound breaking strength and wound collagen deposition at all times studied. The data strongly suggest that T-lymphocytes modulate fibroblast activity during normal wound healing.\r"

Histologic findings and PCA were evaluated on days 1, 2, and 3 and every 2 to 3 days after SIT. No pathologic findings of graft or host tissue developed in group 1 (n = 14). Histologic rejection (blunted villi and mononuclear cell infiltration) was seen beginning on day 5 in group 2 (n = 19); early GVHD (loss of nodal and splenic architecture) was first noted on days 5 and 6 in group 3 (n = 17). PCA elevation in SIT was seen to precede histologic evidence of rejection or graft versus host disease in this model and may constitute an important marker for these immunologic events.\r"

Bronchial reactivity to less than or equal to 8 mumol histamine was present in 14% and was associated with positive skin test responses to common allergens and with smoking history. Both of these relationships were in turn dependent on age, skin sensitivity being the more important determinant of reactivity in the young and smoking the more important in older subjects. Bronchial reactivity was least prevalent in the 35-44 year age group. No independent effect on reactivity of sex, social class, or area of residence was detected, and no significant effect from recent respiratory tract infections. Interpretation of the bronchial response to histamine in selected groups of subjects must take account of age, atopic state, and smoking history.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiological problems arising from the absence of an agreed definition of asthma have led to the use of bronchial reactivity tests in community surveys of asthma prevalence. Since only a minority of the general population will develop bronchoconstriction in response to the dose of histamine considered acceptable for use in the community it is important to make maximum use of the data available. Several methods for summarising the information in the dose-response curve obtained from a histamine challenge test have been compared. A standardised histamine challenge test was administered to 797 subjects selected from two communities, and a repeat test to 106 subjects. The test was well accepted. For most subjects FEV1 rose initially after administration of histamine (median rise 100 ml), so maximum FEV1 was used as the baseline from which the 20% fall to achieve a PD20 was calculated. In order to use all the data rather than just two points on the FEV1-log dose graph, PD20 was estimated by means of curve fitting, and the values were compared with PD20 from linear interpolation. An exponential curve was found to fit the data well. Extrapolation from the maximum dose of 4 mumol up to 8 mumol was allowed in the estimation of PD20 by both methods. The curve fitting method gave slightly more reproducible PD20 values than did linear interpolation, and also gave more estimates in the range 0.03-8 mumol. The repeatability of PD20 compared well with that of asthmatic subjects tested in a clinical environment. Curve fitting has an advantage over linear interpolation in large community studies, for which analysis of data by computer is essential.\r"

  ".W": "The original findings of peripheral anergy in sarcoidosis led to the conclusion that sarcoidosis was a disease associated with immune deficiency, but patients with sarcoidosis do not appear to suffer from repeated infections suggestive of immune suppression. With the technique of bronchoalveolar lavage it is now possible to examine the local immune response within the lung, the most commonly affected organ in sarcoidosis. In this study three different indices of cell mediated immunity (lymphocyte transformation, interleukin-2 production, and interleukin-1 production) have been examined by comparison of cells recovered by lavage with those collected from peripheral blood. It was found that in vitro anergy was confined to peripheral blood cells, where all three markers of the immune response used in this study was impaired in the 12 patients with sarcoidosis group when compared with results in the 12 controls, with the most depressed responses seen in those patients classified as having active disease (lymphocyte proliferation 45% (SD 17%); interleukin-2 production 44% (13%), and interleukin-1 production 31% (10%) of control levels). By contrast, T lymphocytes recovered from the lungs of patients with sarcoidosis showed a greater response than did those from controls in terms of lymphocyte transformation and interleukin-2 production; these differences were greatest in those with active disease (lymphocyte proliferation 209% (27%) and interleukin-2 production 202% (19%) of control levels). Interleukin-1 production by cells of the monocyte lineage recovered from the lung gave similar results to those of the control and sarcoid groups. It is concluded that the anergy seen in the peripheral blood compartment possibly reflects redistribution of T lymphocytes rather than a generalised immune deficiency.\r"

The underlying cause of the symptoms may be an inappropriate spasm of of the distal urethra/external sphincteric unit, leading to increased pressure in the prostatic urethra with a resultant reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts. The presence of urine (sterile or infected) could induce ductal and periductal inflammation, which could further aggravate spasm of the involved pelvic musculature, exacerbating the voiding dysfunction. We present 3 patients in whom this sequence of events was documented radiographically and urodynamically. Consequently, treatment involved modulation of the dysfunction of the distal urethra/external sphincteric unit: (1) reeducation by reassurance and biofeedback was the initial line of therapy; (2) pharmacologic manipulation using alpha-blockers (to affect smooth and striated muscle irritability) and striated muscle relaxants was next tried; (3) finally, in unremitting symptoms, we used selective sacral-root electro-stimulation, successfully fatiguing the involved muscles and relieving the voiding dysfunction.\r"

We describe the techniques and results in 25 patients with 30 fibrinolytic infusions of the popliteal and tibial arteries and compare them with the initial and long-term results of treatment using streptokinase and urokinase. The roles of catheter delivery systems and systemic heparin in the prevention of pericatheter thrombus were also studied. Urokinase was initially successful in 18 (90%) of 20 intraarterial infusions, whereas streptokinase was effective in 8 (80%) of 10 intraarterial infusions. Urokinase had the advantages of a shorter effective infusion time and fewer complications. Long-term follow-up was available in 20 of the successfully treated patients. Sixteen of these patients were doing well with an average follow-up of 27 months. The duration of the initial occlusion may be useful in identifying patients at risk for early reocclusion. No limbs were lost because of complications of therapy. The coaxial catheter system with a divided fibrinolytic dose provided protection against pericatheter thrombus, while systemic heparin was ineffective. Our results suggest that urokinase is more effective than streptokinase for intraarterial infusion in the treatment of occlusion of the popliteal and tibial arteries; this procedure is an important alternative to surgery or an adjuvant to surgery in selected patients.\r"

Angiographers A, B, and C judged the arteriograms of 24, 29, and 25 patients, respectively, as positive for pulmonary embolism. Mean interobserver agreement was 86%. Interobserver agreement was not associated significantly with the quality of the arteriogram or with selective injection of a lobar vs a pulmonary artery, but was associated strongly with the magnitude of thromboembolism. All angiographers agreed that the arteriograms were positive in 18 cases of pulmonary embolism graded as massive, lobar, or segmental, but agreed in only two of 15 cases graded as subsegmental. We conclude that conventional selective pulmonary arteriography is reliable in the detection of embolus in segmental or larger pulmonary arteries. Observer disagreement becomes considerable for embolus limited to subsegmental pulmonary arteries, indicating that emboli of this size are at the resolution limit of the technique.\r"

CT showed evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease in 30 patients (15%). This included mediastinal nodal enlargement in 21, pulmonary metastases in 12, pleural effusions in six, and pleural masses in two. CT not only showed disease in five patients with normal chest radiographs, but also showed additional sites of disease in four other patients with abnormal chest radiographs. The results suggest that mediastinal nodal enlargement is the most common intrathoracic manifestation of metastatic testicular seminoma. CT is more accurate than chest radiography in the detection of metastatic seminoma in the chest and defines the extent of metastatic disease more precisely.\r"

This entity accounted for 1.8% of all appendicitis patients undergoing surgery at our institution during a recent 9-year period. Preoperative radiologic studies in 18 (72%) of 25 cases showed abnormalities indicating the presence of appendicitis or periappendiceal abscess, but not the specific diagnosis of Crohn's disease as the underlying cause. Histopathologic evidence for an isolated, transmural, or granulomatous appendicitis was found in 20 patients; in two of these there was a local recurrence within 3 years after surgery, while 18 others have remained asymptomatic during follow-ups of up to 8 years. In the other five patients Crohn's disease caused appendicitis with concurrent inflammation of the cecum or terminal ileum; three of these cases were complicated by progressive granulomatous ileocolitis within 2 years. The data presented herein indicate that Crohn's disease can originate in and be confined to the appendix, yet manifest clinical symptoms leading to emergency laparotomy; preoperative radiologic findings are similar to those of suppurative appendicitis, but visualization of a markedly thickened appendiceal wall with patent or irregularly narrowed lumen supports the diagnosis of Crohn's appendicitis; and primary Crohn's disease of the appendix has a favorable long-term prognosis after simple appendectomy, despite a 10% incidence of recurrence as granulomatous ileocolitis.\r"

All had IV urography, and half had cystoscopy. Sources of bleeding were found in seven (29%) of 24 patients by IV urography and in five (42%) of 12 patients by cystoscopy. Abnormalities considered responsible for bleeding included renal stones (four), transitional cell carcinoma (one), calcified renal mass (one), lymphoma (one), bladder tumors (two), hemorrhagic cystitis (two), and a bleeding prostate tumor (one). Additionally, an enlarged prostate was the only abnormal finding in five patients. If an enlarged prostate is considered a source of bleeding, the workup that included both IV urography and cystoscopy identified a cause of bleeding in 17 (71%) of 24 patients. The results suggest that IV urography and cystography are warranted in patients who take anticoagulants and who have gross hematuria.\r"

Degenerative changes were found at 58 interspaces; an abnormal bone marrow signal was identified in 29 (50%) of these. On spin-echo pulse sequences with short and long repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs), an area of relative increased signal intensity was seen in the vertebral body adjacent to the disk in 24 cases (17 were bandlike on both sides of the disk, four were focal on one side of the disk, and three were bandlike and focal on one or both sides of the disk). In one patient decreased signal was noted on both short and long TR/TE imaging. In the other four patients decreased signal was noted on short TR/TE pulse sequences and increased signal was evident on long TR/TE. These marrow changes were not present adjacent to normal disks. The relatively high signal intensity on both short and long TR/TE pulse sequences suggests that the increased signal resulted from the conversion of normal hemopoietic bone marrow to fatty marrow. We conclude that bandlike or focal areas of high signal intensity in the bone marrow adjacent to degenerated intervertebral disks occur commonly on MR images of the spine and must not be confused with signal changes from tumors or infections involving the disk space and adjacent vertebral end plates.\r"

Over a 1-year period, emergency room house officers were encouraged to complete a special form that listed only three acceptable indications for lumbosacral spine radiographs: history of trauma, evidence of focal neurologic abnormality, and \"other.\" Neurologic abnormalities included hypesthesia, hyperesthesia or anesthesia of lumbar or sacral dermatomes, weakness or hyporeflexia of the lower extremities, and bladder or bowel incontinence. If the indication \"other\" was chosen, radiographs were done only if the form contained both a one- to two-sentence history and the signed approval of a supervising attending physician. The number and results of lumbosacral spine examinations were compared with those from the previous year, which served as a control. In the control year 1443 examinations were performed, and in the experimental year only 759 were done (a decrease of 47%). The percentage of patients with vertebral fractures increased from 5.1% to 5.8% in the experimental year if only the detection of new fractures was considered positive, and from 9.1% to 13.4% if the detection of fractures of all ages was regarded as significant. The use of the special requisition form appears to be a simple and effective means of reducing unnecessary lumbosacral radiography in the emergency room setting.\r"

The cartilage cap was clearly seen as a region of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. A superficial zone of low signal intensity was seen covering the cartilage cap, corresponding to an intact perichondrium, in all of the five cases in which histologic examination confirmed the presence of an intact perichondrium. The results of MR in these cases suggest that MR is useful in the preoperative planning of cases in which excision of an osteochondroma is necessary. Optimal surgical resection of the lesion requires complete excision of an intact perichondrium to prevent possible recurrence of the tumor.\r"

More than half of the patients with either Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were detected in the earlier stages (stage I or II). Four types of abnormalities were identified with CT: nodal involvement alone (type 1), extranodal involvement alone (type 2), a combination of extranodal and nodal disease (type 3), and multifocal extranodal disease with or without nodal involvement (type 4). In the 18 patients with Hodgkin's disease, a subgroup of mixed cellularity was most common; type 1 was the prevailing CT presentation, and no type 2 or 4 lesions were observed. In the 50 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large-cell lymphoma was the most common histologic subtype, and the most common CT presentation was type 2, followed by type 3. Lymphomatous nodes may be extensive and confluent, but often they are smaller than 2 cm and rarely are necrotized. The most frequent extranodal sites of head and neck lymphomas are Waldeyer's ring, paranasal sinuses, and nasal cavity. Extranodal lymphoma cannot be differentiated reliably from the more commonly occurring carcinoma, although it is less often associated with invasion and destruction of adjacent bony structures. Multiple sites of extranodal involvement, with or without neck lymphadenopathy, may suggest a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

We report 19 cases of increased density in a middle cerebral artery or one of its major branches visible on the initial CT scan of patients subsequently clinically proven to have suffered a cerebrovascular accident. In three cases angiography confirmed the presence of embolus or thrombus as seen on the CT scans. In several cases subsequent CT scans showed the density to dissipate, thereby confirming its nature as thrombus or embolus. Recognition of this finding will allow earlier diagnosis of ischemic infarction, which may be important in instituting an appropriate therapeutic regimen.\r"

Clinical signs and symptoms that characterized a hazardous carotid cavernous fistula included increased intracranial pressure, rapidly progressive proptosis, diminished visual acuity, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks. Cortical venous drainage from the carotid cavernous fistula is secondary to occlusion or absence of the normal venous outflow pathways and is associated with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Angiographic demonstration of a cavernous sinus varix, with extension of the sinus into the subarachnoid space, is associated with an increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Identification of these high-risk features provides a basis for making decisions about treatment.\r"

To differentiate these groups, we propose a functional scan through C1-C2 in which patients are scanned initially as they present, with their heads fixed in lateral rotation. Subsequent scans are obtained with their heads turned to the maximum contralateral rotation. CT scans in patients with atlantoaxial rotary fixation demonstrate no motion at C1-C2 during this maneuver, while those in patients with transient torticollis show a reduction or reversal of the rotation of C1 on C2.\r"

Its value in excluding major arterial injury has not yet been determined. During a 12-month period we obtained dynamic enhanced thoracic CT studies in 20 patients with blunt decelerating thoracic trauma who had abnormal or equivocal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs. In all cases diagnosis was confirmed by either digital subtraction (18 patients) or conventional thoracic angiography (two patients). CT scans showed evidence of direct aortic injury in three patients and evidence of mediastinal hematoma in five others. Four of these eight patients had major arterial injury verified angiographically and at surgery. In two patients the CT scan was considered equivocal; both patients had normal thoracic angiograms. CT excluded direct vascular injury or mediastinal hematoma in 10 patients. All 10 had normal thoracic angiograms. This preliminary study suggests that, in patients sustaining blunt decelerating thoracic trauma, thoracic CT may be more valuable than chest radiography in excluding major vascular injury and, in some cases, may reduce the need for thoracic angiography.\r"

Major angiographic abnormalities were found in 77 patients. Arterial occlusion (46 patients) was caused by intimal flap injury or arterial transection with subsequent thrombosis and frequently presented with an acutely ischemic extremity (27 patients, three of whom required subsequent amputations). Intraluminal defects typical for intimal flaps (20 patients) were the most difficult pathologic entity to diagnose, accounting for two false-positive angiograms and the sole false-negative examination. Focal luminal widening (five patients) corresponded with a partial-thickness injury of the arterial wall. Major angiographic extravasation of contrast material (19 patients) was caused by arterial laceration or transection and usually presented with clinical signs of acute hemorrhage; massive pelvic hemorrhage was the cause of death in three patients. Acute arteriovenous fistulas (four patients) were from arterial laceration with venous communication. Arterial narrowing with a smooth margin (50 patients) was a finding associated with a benign clinical course, except when combined with slowed arterial flow--a characteristic finding of compartment syndrome (six of 13 patients). An irregular beaded pattern of arterial narrowing (23 patients) was associated with severe injuries, subsequent poor fracture healing, and wound infection. A detailed angiographic map is of considerable value in planning surgical management. The absence of major angiographic abnormalities usually eliminates the need for surgical exploration; the location of injury and routes of distal blood flow affect the feasibility of conservative therapy; the length of occlusion influences the necessity of saphenous vein harvesting; the location of arterial extravasation determines the advisability of surgical ligation or transcatheter embolization; and the need for fasciotomy may be suggested first by the angiographic features of compartment syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "87295633\r", 
  ".W": "There is currently a widespread consensus on the importance of monitoring patient radiation exposures during radiographic examinations. Diagnostic facilities under federal jurisdiction already legislate maximum patient exposure limits for various diagnostic radiologic examinations, while an increasing number of state legislatures have instituted such regulations. Compliance requires that institutions be capable of assessing each patient's entrance exposures. A method is proposed that would facilitate the acquisition of such patient exposure information in a relatively straightforward and accurate manner, requiring a minimum number of measurements and access to a suitable programmable calculator. A standardized set of exposure measurements obtained on an accurately calibrated three-phase radiographic unit has been fitted by an analytic function. The average accuracy of the fit between the limits of 40-140 kVp and 2.5- to 6.0-mm aluminum filtration was 0.3%. The concept of linear scaling was employed to allow the analytic function to accurately reproduce the exposure outputs of different radiographic units. Validation experiments on patients indicated that an overall accuracy of 10% can be expected when using well-calibrated radiographic equipment. The method described permits institutions to verify their compliance with federal and/or state regulations and to confirm that their radiation exposures are consistent with national averages.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) measured during maximal exercise testing early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 75 patients, aged 65 years or younger, a mean of 36 days after AMI. At follow-up for a mean 12 months (range 6 to 26), medical complications developed in 15 patients: cardiac death in 5, ventricular fibrillation in 1, reinfarction in 2, unstable angina in 5, and severe cardiac failure in 2. Seven other patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting for severe angina. When LVEF less than 50% at rest was compared with LVEF of 50% or more, the 2-year life-table survival free of complications was 54 +/- 21% compared with 84 +/- 19% (p less than 0.05). When exercise LVEF less than 50% was compared with LVEF of 50% or more, the 2-year survival rate free of medical complication was 42 +/- 32% compared with 83 +/- 20% (p less than 0.05). LVEF change from rest to exercise was not related to prognosis. Patients with combined medical and surgical events tended to have lower rest and exercise LVEFs, but changes in LVEF during exercise were again unrelated to prognosis. Sixty-five patients underwent coronary arteriography. After inferior AMI the mean LVEF was lower in those with multivessel than in those with 1-vessel coronary artery disease at rest (47 +/- 13% vs 59 +/- 7%, p less than 0.005) and during exercise (47 +/- 13% vs 59 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005); however, the change in LVEF during exercise was not related to coronary anatomy anatomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum folacin levels and dietary folacin intake decreased with increasing age but not significantly. During the first year, 75% and 66% of the subjects that were folacin deficient based upon serum and erythrocyte folacin values, respectively, were the same subjects considered to be deficient during the third year. Folacin status, as indicated by serum and erythrocyte folacin values, was not related to per capita income. These findings demonstrate that folacin status is less than adequate in females during the adolescent years.\r"

They also exhibited reduced levels of serum calcium (SCa) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (SAP). The response to calcium (1000 mg/d) and ergocalciferol (20 micrograms/d) supplementation given for 6 mo was evaluated in 65 patients with 69 subjects taken as controls. The treatment induced a significant increase in SCa and in 25-OHD levels, and a subsequent decrease in PTH levels without modification of the mean calcitriol levels. The biochemical changes were more marked in long-stay hospital patients than in outpatients. All these changes were significantly different from those observed in the control group. Increasing the calcium and vitamin D intake reduces the biochemical signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism in elderly people.\r"

Crude IL-1 samples were prepared from acute PEC and assayed for activity. IL-1 preparations from severely and moderately iron-deficient rats enhanced mouse thymocyte proliferation in vitro less than half as much as IL-1 preparations from control rats. In a rabbit bioassay, injection of IL-1 prepared with PEC from either group of iron-deficient rats had little effect on body temperature or plasma minerals, while IL-1 from iron-adequate source PEC produced a febrile response and markedly lowered plasma iron and zinc in recipient rabbits. Severe or moderate iron deficiency, then, clearly impairs IL-1 production by rat PEC.\r"

Chromosome analysis revealed a dicentric X;Y translocation with Xq and Yp breakpoints. Centromeric banding demonstrated a Y centromere and a \"suppressed\" X centromere. The karyotype of the patient was interpreted as 46,X,t(X;Y)(q22;p11). The Yp breakpoint was confirmed by DNA-hybridization studies with six probes detecting Y-specific sequences. These DNA-hybridization studies were consistent with the presence of the long arm, centromere, and much of the proximal short arm of the Y. The Y-DNA studies of this female also revealed the absence of the distal short arm of the Y chromosome, to which the testis-determining factor has previously been localized.\r"

Twenty-five control subjects were studied simultaneously. They were all given a single intravenous infusion of 500 mg of aspirin (lysine acetylsalicylate), and bleeding time was measured two hours later. Both in the control group and in the patient group, aspirin significantly prolonged the bleeding time, but the average prolongation was significantly more pronounced in the patients. In comparison with the control subjects, the patients had a statistically significant reduction of platelet serotonin content and no difference in the production of platelet lipoxygenase derivative 12-HETE or plasma von Willebrand factor properties. Fourteen patients had abnormal platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate, adrenaline (epinephrine), or collagen. In six of them, all with very low serotonin content, the bleeding time was prolonged above the upper limit of the post-aspirin values in the control group. Thus, cyclooxygenase inhibition by aspirin unmasked a bleeding tendency in patients with a severe reduction in platelet dense bodies content. These findings might be relevant in relation to the use of antiplatelet drugs.\r"

During a six-month period, 256 patients who had received anticoagulants were screened for occult bleeding with guaiac-impregnated cards. Twenty-one (12 percent) of the 175 patients who had received anticoagulants and who voluntarily completed the cards had occult gastrointestinal bleeding compared with only two (3 percent) of 74 control patients who had not received anticoagulants. The mean prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time did not differ significantly in the patients who had received anticoagulants with and without subsequent bleeding. Fifteen of 16 patients who had received anticoagulants and who underwent diagnostic evaluation had previously undiagnosed lesions in the intestinal tract. These results indicate that occult gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient who has received an anticoagulant should not be attributed to the anticoagulant; instead, such bleeding often indicates the presence of significant intestinal disease.\r"

  ".W": "The authors tested whether two oncogenic poxviruses, Shope fibroma virus (SFV) and malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MV), coded for an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein. Virus-free lysates of SFV or MV-infected rabbit kidney cells do not appreciably affect proliferation of EGF-unresponsive RK-13 cells. Comparable lysates inhibit the background proliferation of two EGF-responsive cell lines, human foreskin fibroblasts and normal rat kidney cells. Inhibition of EGF-stimulated proliferation is also observed in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition is greatest when the virus lysate preparations are added either simultaneously with or before EGF. When EGF is added to cultures 24 hours before the SFV or MV preparations, the latter then have little or no effect on EGF-induced target cell proliferation. The inhibitory factor competed with radiolabeled EGF for its receptor site. Electroblotting shows a protein of 35 kd molecular weight in the lysates of virus-infected RK-13 cells which reacts with anti-EGF antibody. These findings interpreted to indicate that SFV and MV code for an inhibitor of EGF activity, and that this inhibition occurs at least in part by competitive inhibition of EGF-EGF receptor interactions.\r"

The specific role of alveolar macrophages (AM) in modulating the local cellular immune response to antigens is controversial. Immunoregulatory function and properties of AM and blood monocytes (MN) were compared. The AM were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of healthy volunteers, MN by adherence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to plastic. These accessory cells were added in increasing ratios to a responder population rendered rigorously accessory cell-dependent by nylon wool adherence and depletion of cells bearing the surface Class II MHC determinant, HLA-DR. At low ratios of mononuclear phagocytes to lymphocytes (less than or equal to 1:10), MN and AM supported significant and comparable blastogenic responses to tetanus toxoid (3H-thymidine incorporation at a 1:10 ratio was 9,697 +/- 2,508 for MN and 8,969 +/- 1,454 for AM, mean cpm +/- SE, n = 9, p = NS) and other antigens. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity in supernatants of MN stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 micrograms/ml, was 115 +/- 28 versus 67 +/- 21 U/ml in supernatants of AM (n = 9, p greater than 0.2). At suboptimal concentrations of LPS, however, MN expressed more IL-1 activity than did AM. The specific mean fluorescence intensity of surface expression of HLA-DR determinants as assessed by flow cytometry was similar for MN and AM. At the higher ratio of 1:2, MN supported 32% increased responses to tetanus toxoid compared with that at 1:5 (p less than 0.05). In contrast, AM at a ratio of 1:2 suppressed lymphocyte response by 69% (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After adjusting for smoking habits, age, gender, and city of residence, subjects with either occupational exposure had significantly elevated prevalences of chronic cough, chronic phlegm, persistent wheeze, and breathlessness. The adjusted relative odds of chronic respiratory symptoms for subjects exposed to dust ranged from 1.32 to 1.60. Subjects with gas or fume exposure had relative odds of symptoms between 1.27 and 1.43 when compared with unexposed subjects. Occupational dust exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as defined by an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.6, when comparing exposed and unexposed participants (OR = 1.53, 95% Cl = 1.17-2.08). Gas or fume exposure was associated with a small, but not significant, increase in COPD prevalence. Significant trends were noted for wheeze and phlegm with increasing duration of dust exposure. Although 36% of exposed subjects reported exposure to both dust and fumes, there was no evidence of a multiplicative interaction between the effects of the individual exposures. Smoking was a significant independent predictor of symptoms, but did not appear to modify the effect of dust or fumes on symptom reporting. These data, obtained in random samples of general populations, demonstrate that chronic respiratory symptoms and disease can be independently associated with occupational exposures.\r"

Design: Longitudinal survey of consecutive patients who were given the treatment. Each patient was initially interviewed within 5 days before treatment, and a personal and family psychiatric history was obtained during this first session. Cognitive tests and mood self-rating instruments were administered at the beginning and end of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell treatments, before discharge, and at a follow-up visit 2 to 4 weeks after discharge. Setting: National Cancer Institute inpatient units at the National Institutes of Health. Patients or Other Participants: Sequential samples of 44 patients with metastatic cancer (age range, 28 to 69 years) who were treated systemically with recombinant interleukin-2 combined with autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells between 30 December 1985 and 31 March 1986. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 44 patients studied, 15 developed severe behavioral changes that necessitated acute intervention, and 22 patients had severe cognitive changes (all 22 became disoriented and many also had psychometric evidence of cognitive deterioration). The neuropsychiatric side effects were dose and time related, appearing more frequently at the higher dose and almost uniformly at the end of each treatment phase. All 39 patients who were seen at follow-up had a return to their baseline cognitive scores. None of the factors investigated was found to be predictive of the development of neuropsychiatric toxicity. Conclusions: The development of clinically significant neuropsychiatric changes during the administration of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells was common and may be treatment limiting. A marked latency in the appearance of neuropsychiatric changes after treatment onset was noted in almost all patients. Every patient studied recovered from the neuropsychiatric side effects.\r"

As the eye inflammation resolved, healing of the chorioretinal lesion was complicated by the development of a subretinal neovascular membrane.

About 50-fold more ganciclovir triphosphate was produced by LH7 cells than by either LM or LMTK- cells. Growth inhibition studies indicated that 180 and 120 microM ganciclovir were required to achieve 50% growth inhibition of LM and LMTK- cells, respectively; only 0.07 microM ganciclovir was necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of LH7 cells. DNA synthesis in the transformed cells was significantly reduced by ganciclovir treatment, whereas ganciclovir had little effect on DNA synthesis in the nontransformed cells. Alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of transformed cellular DNA indicated that LH7 DNA synthesized in the presence of ganciclovir chased into mature DNA. Both LM and LH7 DNA synthesized in the presence of ganciclovir exhibited a concentration-dependent reduction in the rate of elongation into mature DNA. Finally, [14C]ganciclovir was incorporated internally into the growing chains of LH7 cells.\r"

These agents efficiently inhibited the cytopathic effects and expression of HIV-specific antigens in MT-4 cells after infection of the virus. Both DHT and DHC also strongly blocked viral replication as determined by our quantitative bioassay system using a plaque-forming assay. These antiviral effects were obtained at concentrations at which the drugs produced little or no toxicity and were comparable to those with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. These findings warrant further investigation of the use of DHT and DHC for the treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related diseases.\r"

Each patient was followed in the postoperative period with serial electrocardiograms and continuous monitoring. In the last 70 patients, a technetium pyrophosphate scan was obtained 48 to 72 hours after operation. Postoperatively, new bundle-branch or fascicular block developed in 42 patients (45%) and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, in 4 (4%). The occurrence was compared with patient age, preoperative bundle-branch block or fascicular block, number of diseased arteries, number of bypassed arteries, total time of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping time, occurrence of a preoperative or perioperative myocardial infarction, and presence of disease in the left anterior descending or right coronary artery. Only the number of bypassed arteries, the total time of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the aortic cross-clamping time were related to the development of postoperative conduction defects (all, p less than .05). The conduction defect resolved partially or completely by the time of hospital discharge in 54% of patients. In the 4 patients with third-degree AV block, AV block resolved on postoperative day 2 in 1 patient and resolved transiently for up to 5 days or persisted in 3 patients. At two months of follow-up, all 3 patients discharged in third-degree AV block with a permanent pacemaker were no longer in AV block. In conclusion, following CABG, the occurrence of new AV conduction defects is related to the number of vessels bypassed, the cardiopulmonary bypass pump time, and the aortic cross-clamping time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty-three patients (59%) required intravenous administration of nitroglycerin and/or the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) for relief of angina. Oral medications relieved angina in the remaining 44 patients. Thirty-eight patients underwent CABG 7 days or less after the infarction (Group 1), 25 received it between 8 and 15 days later (Group 2), and 44 had CABG between 16 and 30 days later (Group 3). There were 9 in-hospital deaths: 4 in Group 1, 2 in Group 2, and 3 in Group 3. Thirteen patients needed the IABP for hemodynamic stability as well as relief of angina. Even when the patient was stable hemodynamically, death was more likely to occur among these 13 patients if CABG was conducted within 7 days of infarction. Follow-up was 94% complete at 29.4 months. Eighty-six percent of patients were asymptomatic or in New York Heart Association Functional Class I, and 6% were in Class II. There were 2 late deaths. CABG for angina can be accomplished within 30 days of an acute infarction with good results. The exception to this rule is the patient in whom shock develops after a myocardial infarction and who, despite stabilization, receives CABG within 7 days of the infarction.\r"

All patients were operated on at least 10 years ago and follow-up at 10 years was 93.8% complete. The overall 14-year survival probabilities were: for one-vessel disease, 73.3%; for two-vessel disease, 45.9%; for three-vessel disease, 34.2%; and for left main coronary artery disease, 41.9%. Patients with good left ventricular function had an overall survival rate of 53.3%, and patients with poor ventricular function had a survival rate of 31.9%. Preoperative variables predictive of greater risk of total mortality were: digoxin usage, multivessel disease, poor quality of left ventricular function, age at operation, electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, previous stroke, diabetes, heart failure, diuretic usage, cigarette smoking, and residual ungrafted coronary artery disease. The major determinants of long-term survival were variables associated with preoperative left ventricular function. Diabetes was the only important metabolic risk factor identified. This study suggests that unfavorable preoperative conventional risk factors should not be considered a contraindication to operation in patients with adequate coronary anatomy and left ventricular function.\r"

To delineate the hemodynamic effects of nitrous oxide after cardiac surgery, we studied 11 patients with a mean age of 63 years who had undergone isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. All patients had major coronary artery disease and normal preoperative hemodynamic function. When patients were in stable condition in the intensive care unit, hemodynamic measurements were made at an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% with progressive doses of nitrous oxide (0, 10, 20, 40, and 60%). Measured and calculated hemodynamic data were compared using analysis of variance. Nitrous oxide caused significant decreases in mean arterial pressure in a dose-related fashion; pressure fell 6 mm Hg at 10% nitrous oxide and 11 mm Hg at 60% nitrous oxide (6 and 13% decreases). These changes were not associated with significant alteration in pulmonary artery pressure or cardiac index. Left ventricular stroke work index decreased significantly with the administration of nitrous oxide. We conclude that, in patients with normal hemodynamic and ventricular function, the administration of nitrous oxide for its sedative and antihypertensive effects is safe in the postoperative period and may be useful, especially in patients who are candidates for early extubation.\r"

With paraffin sections, three lectins--wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I), and concanavalin A (Con A)--stained the abnormal deposits. In frozen sections, the abnormal deposits were stained by five lectins--WGA, RCA-I, Con A, peanut agglutinin (PNA), and soybean agglutinin (SBA). In paraffin sections, PNA and SBA did not stain amyloid deposits. In both paraffin and frozen sections, some lectin-positive deposits corresponded to the Congo red-positive material, whereas others were present surrounding and encroaching on the Congo red-reactive material. This study demonstrates that WGA-, RCA-I-, Con A-, PNA-, and SBA-positive abnormal deposits are present in corneas with lattice dystrophy. Since lectins bind to specific sugar residues, we conclude that the abnormal deposits consist, at least in part, of glycoconjugates and that these glycoconjugates contain oligosaccharides with N-acetylglucosamine/sialic acid, mannose/glucose and terminal beta-galactose residues and chains with terminal beta-galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine disaccharides.\r"

Since the HLA-D region is complex (composed of at least 3 subregions encoding multiple molecules, each in turn presenting multiple alloantigenic epitopes), we sought to clarify whether one strongly associated factor might explain the previous findings. To search for the pertinent HLA-D region stimulatory epitopes, alloreactive T cells were primed against DR5 and DRw6 haplotypes and cloned by limiting dilution. Three T cell clones and 1 alloantiserum met the criteria for significant association with juvenile arthritis on patient testing, including DR5, DRw6, and DRw8 haplotypes. Monoclonal antibody blocking revealed that all 4 recognized epitopes on DR subregion products. For 2 of the clones, the relative risks for JA (10.5 and 9.4) were higher than the risks with any other previously described typing reagents.\r"

Helper to suppressor ratios were within the norm for the total group, but specific site variances were detected in patients with oral cavity and hypopharyngeal primary carcinomas. Similarly altered T4/T8 ratios were noted with stage III disease. Substantive differences in natural killer cell activity were not observed. These data suggest that perturbations in T-lymphocyte subsets can be associated with decreased survival.\r"

Two principles of clinical management are derived: (1) information regarding head trauma sustained before SD symptom onset is significant; (2) the absence of neuropathology on a single measure of central nervous system function should not be considered conclusive evidence that no neurologic lesions exist.\r"

  ".W": "A new primate retrovirus, STLV-IIIAGM, has been recently isolated from healthy African green monkeys and is apparently nonpathogenic in its natural host. However, spontaneous infection as well as inoculation of STLV-IIIAGM into macaques induces a disease with clinical features that resemble human AIDS. Independent isolates of human retroviruses, serologically closely related to STLV-IIIAGM, have been obtained from healthy individuals (HTLV-IV) and patients with immunodeficiency (LAV-2FG and SBL 6669) from West Africa. The latter have also been referred to as HIV-2 because, like HTLV-III/HIV-1, they may be associated with immune deficiency, or as West African human retroviruses because of their prevalence and probable origin from that region. We have molecularly cloned the STLV-IIIAGM genome and have generated probes from the gag-pol and envelope genes to analyze the genetic relatedness of these simian and human retroviruses. Our results indicate that all these retroviruses are genetically closely related to each other, HTLV-IV and STLV-IIIAGM differing only by a few restriction enzyme sites while LAV-2FG and SBL 6669 exhibit greater polymorphism from HTLV-IV/STLV-IIIAGM. These data mirror the variable degree of relatedness among members of the first subgroup of human retroviruses, HTLV-III/HIV.\r"

Here we report that elements upstream of position -104 (start site +1) do not affect transcriptional activity in vitro whereas sequences between -104 and -57 are required for such activity. Using a reconstituted RNA polymerase II system, we demonstrate that a partially purified fraction containing Spl not only stimulates, as was previously reported, but is required for accurate initiation of transcription directed by the HIV LTR. In addition, based on a computerized analysis, we report the presence of a region in the HIV LTR (positions -151 to -80) that is similar to the 72 base pair enhancer element of SV40 and that includes a highly conserved segment also present in the cytomegalovirus enhancer. Moreover, the HIV and HTLV-I LTRs are shown to share a region of similarity that includes the 21 base pair motif found in the enhancers of the human and bovine T-lymphotropic viruses. The R region of the HIV LTR is found to have two extensive regions of dyad symmetry rather than one as was previously reported. The significance of these observations for HIV pathogenesis is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the mechanism of lymphocytotoxicity induced by human T-lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), an in vitro model has been developed. Introduction of an HTLV-III/LAV proviral clone, HXB2, into normal lymphocytes results in the production of virions and cell death. The complete nucleotide sequence of the proviral form of HXB2 has now been determined. Its structure is quite similar to that previously determined for HTLV-III/LAV clones whose biological capacities had not previously been demonstrated. The biological function of two additional clones of HTLV-III/LAV, BH10 and HXB3, are reported. Clone BH10 which lacks the 5' long terminal repeat sequences (LTR) and a portion of the 3' LTR is reconstituted by substituting the corresponding sequences of HXB2 and is shown to be capable of generating infectious cytopathic virions. Clone HXB3, which has been partially sequenced, is also found to be capable of producing lymphocytopathic virus. Clone HXB3 differs from HXB2 in its lack of a termination codon in 3' orf, demonstrating that 3' orf plays no major role in virus replication or cytopathic activity. These data provide the necessary background to allow the identification of viral determinants of replication, cytopathic activity, and antigenicity using these functional proviral clones.\r"

  ".W": "Tetanus toxoid (TT) reactive CD4+ cells were infected with HTLV-IIIB and exposed to TT at various times throughout a 7-day interval. Acute infection per se failed to produce overt cytopathology. However, exposure of infected cells to TT resulted in a rapid loss of cell viability, an increase in viral p24 expression, and a decline in T-cell blastogenesis. To determine whether HIV infection of antigen presenting cells (APC) could impact on T-cell activation, virus infected APC were utilized to present TT to responsive CD4+ cells. Use of infected APC produced effects similar to antigen stimulation of infected T-cells. These results suggest that the conditions of antigen presentation during T-cell activation may provide an excellent opportunity for virus transmission which may produce maximal immune dysfunction. However, preincubating antigen specific T-cells with the virostatic agent 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) could prevent most of these effects.\r"

The assay used a murine fibroblast cell line which is sensitive to the effects of tumor necrosis factors, but nonpermissive for HIV-1 replication. Cytotoxic activity was detected in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1. However, no differences in activity were found in conditioned media from infected lymphoid or monocytoid cell lines compared to their uninfected counterparts. These data suggest that cytotoxic activities of this type are not mediators of cell killing resulting from HIV-1 infection. Thus, this cytotoxic activity is a direct or indirect result of virus replication or cytopathicity. One should consider a role for this cytotoxic factor, secreted by HIV-1 infected mononuclear cells, in various aspects of infection in vivo, such as AIDS encephalopathy or the systemic manifestations accompanying ARC.\r"

A newly described antibody (NK9) recognizing natural killer (NK) cells and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes was included, and the numbers and activity of circulating NK cells was determined. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the numbers of NK9-positive cells were highest in LIS. The distribution of T lymphocytes (OKTII + ve), helper T cells (OKT4 + ve), suppressor T cells (OKT8 + ve), Langerhans cells (OKT6 + ve) and activated T cells (anti-Tac + ve) in LIS differed from those in DLE,SLE and allergic contact reactions. However, the number of circulating NK cells (large granular lymphocytes) and the NK activity in peripheral blood were normal in LIS. We conclude that in LIS a distinct type of T cell activation occurs; the cause of this remains to be determined.\r"

Assessment before and after treatment was by 7-day bladder charts, urethral pressure profiles and perineometry. Approximately two-thirds of the hospital-treated patients (groups 1, 2 and 3) experienced marked or moderate subjective improvement and at 6 months, 27% were dry or almost dry. There was little difference in outcome between groups 1, 2 and 3 but hospital-based therapy was more effective than home treatment. Statistical analyses showed that there were significant improvements in the objective indices measured in the 45 hospital-treated patients. Successful treatment was more likely in younger patients, in those with lesser degrees of genuine stress incontinence and those who had had no previous pelvic floor surgery.\r"

TCR alpha gene transcription was also studied. TRG gamma and TCR beta genes were found to be rearranged in all but one case. The TRG gamma rearrangement pattern seen in most cases is compatible with biallelic rearrangement by loop excision involving the J gamma 2 regions. The sizes of all but two rearranged bands were identical to those of the rearranged bands seen in polyclonal T lymphocytes also studied in this work. One identical-sized band was found in 11 of the 18 rearranged cases. The expression of TRG gamma mRNA (transcripts of 1.6 kilobases [kb]) was highly variable from case to case and did not correlate with the stage of differentiation of the malignant cells, the expression of the molecules CD4 and CD8, the expression and size of the transcripts of the TCR beta genes, and the transcription of TCR alpha genes. In one CD3 + case, strong expression of the TRG gamma transcripts coexisted with the exclusive presence of TCR beta mRNA of 1.0 kb. The cells from this case did not react with anti-Ti antibody and exhibited no natural killer activity. These findings are suggestive of a malignancy that may express the recently isolated CD3-TRG gamma complex.\r"

Our results confirm the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of the cells from acute T cell malignancies, which contrast with the more limited phenotypic diversity of subacute or chronic T cell malignancies. Our study of normal children and fetal thymus cells shows that the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of the malignant cells reflects the heterogeneity of the thymic subpopulations and shows that most of the phenotypes observed on malignant T cells have a normal counterpart, particularly in the fetal thymus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CD1a molecules, which can form three different types of noncovalent intermolecular complexes on the surface of normal thymus cells, do not form any noncovalent intermolecular complexes on the surface of leukemic cells. We also show that CD1a molecules can form covalent intermolecular complexes with CD8 molecules on some but not all malignant cells.\r"

In cBML, CD10 intensity is positively correlated with CD34 (MY10) and terminal transferase (TdT) expression and inversely correlated with common leukocyte antigen (CLA), CD20 (B1), and ctyoplasmic mu chain (Cmu) expression. In cALL, CD10 density was inversely correlated with CLA and Cmu expression and strongly correlated with CD34 expression as in cBML. In contrast to cBML, TdT and CD20 expression were not related to CD10 density in cALL. Furthermore, cALL TdT intensity measured by enzyme immunoassay was not related to expression of CD10, CLA, or CD34, but was positively correlated with CD20 expression. Cmu expression in cALL was inversely correlated with expression of CD34 and positively correlated with CLA as in cBML, but showed no association with TdT intensity or CD20 expression in contrast to the relationship found in cBMLs. Analysis of TdT intensity and Cmu expression in sorted subpopulations of cells from individual patients that were positive or negative for CD34, CD20, or CD10 was consistent with the data obtained by comparison of cells from different patients. These results indicate that from patient to patient and within individual patients, cALL cells express the markers CD34, CLA, CD10, and Cmu in a coordinated fashion similar to cBMLs, but demonstrate differences in expression of TdT and CD20 with respect to the marrow cells considered their normal counterparts. The cALL cells that are CD34 positive show increased expression of CD10 and are less likely to be CLA or Cmu positive, suggesting that they may represent a phenotypically less differentiated form of cALL than does CD34-negative cALL.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the suggestion that von Willebrand factor (vWf) can substitute for fibrinogen in supporting ADP-induced aggregation of human platelets, we studied platelet reactions in two media: (1) a high calcium medium, Tyrode-albumin solution containing calcium ions in the physiological range of 2 mmol/L, and (2) a low calcium medium, modified Tyrode-albumin solution from which calcium salt was omitted (calcium ion concentration approximately 20 mumol/L). In the high calcium medium vWf even at concentrations up to six times as high as physiological, showed little or no potentiation of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, whereas fibrinogen strongly potentiated reversible aggregation without thromboxane formation or release of granule contents. In the low calcium medium, either vWf or fibrinogen supported biphasic aggregation in response to ADP, with thromboxane formation and release of granule contents. Aspirin and the thromboxane receptor blocker BM 13.177 inhibited these secondary responses to von Willebrand factor, indicating that they require thromboxane A2 formation and feedback amplification by thromboxane A2. A monoclonal antibody, 10E5, to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex inhibited both primary and secondary aggregation. Although vWf supports ADP-induced aggregation when the concentration of ionized calcium is in the micromolar range, it does not support ADP-induced aggregation in the presence of a concentration of ionized calcium in the physiological range, indicating that vWf probably cannot substitute for fibrinogen in supporting ADP-induced aggregation in vivo.\r"

Oesophageal varices were eradicated in 33 patients after seven injections (range 1-17) over a mean of 14.5 months (range 1-48). Fewer injections were needed to eradicate varices in older patients. Variceal bleeding occurred on 13 occasions in 9 patients before eradication of varices and on 4 occasions in 4 of the 33 patients in whom varices had been eradicated, with a mean follow-up of 44 months (range 3-105). There were no deaths during the study period. Complications, mostly of a minor nature, occurred in 25 patients and included injection site leak in 5, stenosis in 7 and mucosal ulceration in 23. We conclude that injection sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice in patients with EHPVO.\r"

The frequency of re-bleeding before the eradication of oesophageal varices was significantly less in the over-tube group than in the free-hand group (P less than 0.01), although all re-bleedings were well controlled with additional injections of 5 per cent ethanolamine oleate. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regard to the frequency of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for eradication of oesophageal varices. The over-tube technique is safer than the free-hand technique and takes less time to accomplish; at the initial session of treatment, time and bleeding during these techniques were 11.5 +/- 2.3 min (mean +/- s.d.) and 7.3 +/- 5.9 ml in the over-tube technique, and 20.4 +/- 4.1 min and 45.1 +/- 30.0 ml in the free-hand technique (P less than 0.001, in both time and bleeding).\r"

Adjuvant treatments directed at this site should be investigated in an attempt to improve survival in patients with these cancers. In the study reported here, a model of intraperitoneal tumor in the mouse was established and shows the effectiveness of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the control of intraperitoneal tumor. A standard regimen was used to treat seven different tumors in three different mouse strains. In all seven cases a significant reduction in the intraperitoneal tumor mass was observed when LAK cells plus IL-2 were used as immunotherapy. A prolonged survival was also demonstrated in mice with intraperitoneal tumor. The relevance of these observations to patients with cancer was demonstrated in that allogeneic and syngeneic LAK cells were equally effective, LAK cells generated from normal and from tumor-bearing donors showed equal reactivity, and this treatment was successful in the immuno-compromised host. Both IL-2 derived from an IL-2-producing subline of the EL-4 thymoma and recombinant IL-2 were equally effective in the control of intraperitoneal tumor. The local-regional effects of the intraperitoneal administration of IL-2 were demonstrated by high levels of LAK cell cytotoxicity in peritoneal exudate cells. Intraperitoneal IL-2 or IL-2 plus LAK cell regimens should be investigated in the treatment of malignancy that spreads by implantation onto peritoneal surfaces.\r"

Levels were measured by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and specific radioimmunoassays. The subjects included eight children ages 2 years, 5 months to 9 years, 10 months. There were three girls and 5 boys with pseudoprecocious puberty due to adrenocortical tumors (histologically, four were AC and four, AA). The preoperative showed that DOC and S levels were elevated in all patients, F levels were elevated in four of eight children when compared with age-matched controls, whereas B was normal. Postoperatively, all levels returned to normal. The ratios of B/DOC and F/S as an index of adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase activity were calculated. The preoperative ratios of B/DOC were markedly decreased in all patients with AC compared to controls (7.7,4.1,5.9,1.9 versus 23.5, median), but normal in three of four patients with AA (16.2, 29.6, 16.1). The F/S ratios were significantly lower in AC and AA when compared with controls. The data indicate a deficiency in 11 beta-hydroxylation in cases of adrenocortical tumors. Despite a still limited number of patients, the decreased B/DOC ratios may possibly indicate malignancy and could be helpful in distinguishing by biochemical means between benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Aortocoronary vein bypass surgery might not restore normal maximal coronary flow reserve to bypassed coronary vessels because residual diffuse coronary atherosclerosis might limit maximal hyperemia. To investigate the effect of diffuse atherosclerosis and a focal stenosis at the graft-coronary anastomosis, we measured coronary flow reserve with an extensively validated subselective Doppler catheter in 24 patients with 35 bypass grafts perfusing angiographically normal coronary vessels. The Doppler catheter was positioned in the midportion of the graft, and coronary flow reserve was measured as the peak/resting velocity ratio after selective graft injection of a maximally vasodilating dose of papaverine. Luminal dimensions of the bypass graft, graft-coronary insertion, and bypassed coronary vessel were measured by quantitative coronary angiography (Brown/Dodge method). Measurements of coronary flow reserve and coronary dimensions of vein bypass grafts were compared with similar measurements obtained from 13 patients with normal coronary vessels and normal myocardium. Seventeen of the 35 bypass grafts perfused unobstructed coronary-vein graft anastomoses (less than 50% area stenosis) and normal myocardium. The coronary flow reserve of these 17 bypass grafts was normal (5.0 +/- 0.4, mean +/- SEM) and not significantly different from that measured in normal arteries (5.1 +/- 0.6), even though the cross-sectional area of the native coronary artery just distal to the bypass insertion was 40% smaller than in matched normal vessels. Bypass grafts perfusing hypertrophied (n = 2) or infarcted (n = 6) myocardium had significantly reduced coronary flow reserve compared with normal vessels (2.7 +/- 0.3; p less than .01), even when the infarcted wall had only minimal hypokinesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The composition of the infiltrates was similar in allergic and irritant reactions and consisted of T-lymphocytes of helper/inducer types in association with T-cell accessory cells, i.e., Langerhans cells and HLA-DR-positive macrophages. No differences in expression of T-cell or macrophage associated antigens were seen in early as opposed to late biopsies. In contrast, the proportion of cells positive for markers associated with activation (interleukin-2 receptor) or proliferation (transferrin receptor, the Ki-67 nuclear antigen) of lymphoid cells was found to increase with time in both types of reaction. These data substantiate the view that T-cell immune reactions are implicated in both allergic and toxic patch test lesions, and indicate that the lymphocytes in the infiltrates are activated and proliferate.\r"

  ".U": "87303975\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed a microperifusion system in which we have examined the ACTH secretory responses of acutely dispersed normal rat anterior pituitary cells to ovine CRF (oCRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), alone and in combination. The system approached square-wave stimulus hydrodynamics. ACTH secretion was observed within 5 sec of exposure to either secretagogue and reached a maximum within 20-40 sec. ACTH secretion remained constant for as long as oCRF was perifused and then fell gradually toward the basal level. Persistent ACTH release after oCRF perifusion was stopped could not be explained by persistence of oCRF in the perifusion chamber. In contrast to the response to oCRF, ACTH secretion fell progressively toward basal despite continued AVP perifusion. AVP had a synergistic effect with oCRF only if it was perifused simultaneously with oCRF or within 30 sec after oCRF was stopped; it had no synergistic effect if perifused immediately before oCRF. Simultaneous perifusion of oCRF and AVP resulted in an oCRF-like response of greater magnitude, whereas sequential perifusion of oCRF followed by AVP resulted in the usual plateau response to oCRF followed by the initial spike response characteristic of very high concentrations of AVP alone and a subsequent rapid decrease in secretion despite continued perifusion of AVP. The different kinetic response profiles suggest that oCRF and AVP act via different intracellular signal transduction pathways, and the time and sequence dependency of their synergism suggests that the factors that mediate their interactions have different intracellular half-lives. The microperifusion system appears to be uniquely suited to detailed kinetic analysis of anterior pituitary hormone secretion and the intracellular pathways through which secretagogues act and interact.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the bone-resorbing activity in the conditioned medium from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures with that of partially purified human monocyte-derived interleukin 1 (IL-1), human recombinant IL-1 alpha (pI 5) and IL-1 beta (pI 7), human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and PTH in fetal rat long bone cultures. An antiserum to the products of activated human mononuclear cells, including IL-1, completely blocked the bone-resorbing activity of all three forms of IL-1 and of unfractionated PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell supernatants, but did not inhibit resorption stimulated by recombinant human TNF alpha. This antiserum also had no effect on the resorptive response to 3 nM PTH, but did decrease the response to 1 nM PTH slightly. These results imply that IL-1, but not TNF alpha, mediates the bone-resorbing activity found in the supernatants of PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. It is not known whether the small inhibitory effect that the antiserum to IL-1 had on the response to 1 nM PTH resulted from a nonspecific action or an effect of PTH on local IL-1 synthesis in bone. Since cytokines are found in the circulation of normal individuals and are produced at local sites of pathology, these results suggest that they can influence both normal and abnormal skeletal metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The functional role of central catecholamines in regulation of ACTH secretion remains controversial. In the present report, the nature of catecholaminergic influences was directly assessed by measurement of hypophysial-portal plasma immunoreactive CRF (irCRF) levels after activation of endogenous aminergic pathways by electrical stimulation or administration of norepinephrine (NE). Electrical stimulation of the ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle, a fiber system primarily carrying catecholaminergic fibers arising from brainstem regions, resulted in a 2.9-fold elevation of portal irCRF levels. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist coryanthine, but not the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, blocked the facilitatory effect of electrical stimulation and reduced prestimulation irCRF levels by 34.7 +/- 4.2% (P less than 0.05). Intracerebroventricular administration of 0.1-5.0 nmol NE resulted in a dose-dependent facilitation of portal plasma irCRF levels which could be blocked by pretreatment with coryanthine. Alternatively, administration of greater than or equal to 5 nmol NE caused a dose-dependent inhibition of irCRF release which could be prevented by pretreatment with propranolol. Finally, irCRF secretion evoked by nitroprusside-induced hypotension was also blocked by pretreatment with coryanthine, but not propranolol. These observations provide strong evidence in favor of a predominantly stimulatory action of NE (and possibly epinephrine) at the hypothalamic level to evoke secretion of CRF and thus to activate the pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

Patients receiving phenytoin (PHT) at the time of scan and patients with less than 5 years total PHT exposure had lower LCMRglu, but the differences were not significant. There were weak inverse correlations between PHT level and cerebellar LCMRglu in patients receiving PHT (r = -0.36; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1), as well as between length of illness and LCMRglu (r = -0.22; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1).

Baseline and 3-month evaluation of psychological performance through selected Beta R, Wechsler memory scale, visual discrimination, MMPI, and Zung's rated depression scale. Tests were evaluated for significant changes by the parametric student's t test and Mann Whitney nonparametric test. Clinical seizures were significantly reduced by electrical stimulation (ES), as were EEG interictal spikes and EEG slow waves. Psychological performance improved beyond that expected by reduction in seizure activity. ESCM induced a local afterdischarge (AD) that progressively developed in time and intensity, and the beneficial effects outlasted ES for periods of weeks to months, suggesting that a state of hyperexcitability of stimulated tissue, similar to \"kindling,\" was created by chronic ES.\r"

When EP was applied into the perfusate 18% of warm-responsive neurons decreased their activity, and 23% of warm-responsive neurons increased their activity. Most of the thermally insensitive neurons did not respond to EP. PGE2 inhibited 29% of warm-responsive neurons and facilitated 15% of them. Moreover, when EP and PGE2 were applied to the same neurons at different times, the same directions of changes in neuronal activity were observed in 72% of total neurons examined. These results suggest that EP and PGE2 change the neuronal activity of the thermoresponsive neurons in the PO-AH region involved in fever induction. However, by these results, the direction of neuronal response induced by these substances could not be generally categorized based on the thermoresponsiveness of the individual neuron.\r"

We examined three HTLV-I-transformed lymphocyte cell lines, two HTLV-II-transformed lymphocyte cell lines, and six HTLV-negative B and T-lymphocyte leukemia cell lines for metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3). One HTLV-I-positive cell line, designated S-LB1, converted the substrate 25OH-[3H]D3 to several more polar metabolites, which were identified by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis as putative 1,25-(OH)2D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25-(OH)2D3], and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,24,25-(OH)3D3]. The other cell lines gave no evidence of 25OH-[3H]D3 metabolism. Likewise, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes did not metabolize 25OH-[3H]D3. The characteristics of 25OHD3 metabolism by S-LB1 cells were investigated in more detail. Kinetic studies revealed average Km values of 92 and 383 nM for 25OHD3 1-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase, respectively. Time-course studies showed that both 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 and 24,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 were further metabolized by S-LB1 cells to more polar compounds [primarily 1,24,25-(OH)3D3] and to compounds from which part of the side-chain had been cleaved. Exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1) inhibited endogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 production, (2) stimulated 24,25-(OH)2D3 production, and (3) stimulated production of compounds more polar than 1,25-(OH)2D3. Bovine PTH-(1-34) had no effect on 25OH-[3H]D3 metabolism by S-LB1 cells. Our results indicate that the 25OH-[3H]D3-metabolizing system of cultured HTLV-I-transformed S-LB1 lymphocytes is similar but not identical to that of kidney cell culture systems. It appears, however, that infection of lymphocytes with HTLV does not uniformly result in acquisition of the competence to metabolize 25OHD3.\r"

These findings explain the clinical endocrine effects of ketoconazole in the usual therapeutic doses, which include inhibition of cortisol and androgen secretion, compensatory ACTH-mediated secretion of 17-desoxysteroids such as progesterone and aldosterone, and suppression of PRA.\r"

To investigate whether this abnormality is a common feature of other autoimmune diseases, we studied 10 EBV-immune normal subjects and 22 EBV-immune patients with Graves' disease (GD); 11 had newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism, and 11 had received carbimazole treatment for hyperthyroidism for at least 6 months. Peripheral B lymphocytes infected with EBV were cultured for 20 days in the presence or absence of autologous T cells at different ratios. Immunoglobulins M and G secretion into the supernatants was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The extent of suppression when T cells were added, as measured by a suppression ratio, was not significantly different in normal subjects and newly diagnosed GD patients (0.65 vs. 0.63 on the 16th day and 0.77 vs. 0.72 on the 20th day of culture, respectively). In carbimazole-treated patients, the appearance of functional suppressor T cells was delayed slightly, but the overall suppression ratios on the 16th and 20th days were normal. Thus, a T cell regulation abnormality of EBV-induced B cell activation could not be demonstrated in patients with untreated hyperthyroid GD, suggesting that the autoimmune reactivity in such patients is probably dependent upon a specific thyroid suppression defect rather than a generalized suppression defect.\r"

We compared serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], and bone Gla-protein (BGP), a specific marker of bone formation during the first month of life in fullterm and preterm neonates. Measurements were performed in cord blood and on days 1, 5, and 30 of life. In maternal blood, mean serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations were higher in the mothers of premature than in those of fullterm neonates, and serum BGP concentrations were lower than those in nonpregnant women. In cord blood mean serum BGP levels were 2-3 times higher than in adults. Serum BGP increased significantly on days 5 and 30 in fullterm infants. In preterm infants, and increase was found only on day 30. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations were lower in neonates than in mothers, but not different in fullterm and preterm neonates. In fullterm infants serum 1,25-(OH)2D increased rapidly from birth to day 5 and decreased on day 30. The pattern was similar in preterm infants, but 1,25-(OH)2D was higher than in fullterm infants on day 30. No sustained correlation between serum BGP and 1,25-(OH)2D levels was found. These data support the contention that changes in 1,25-(OH)2D reflect the perinatal equilibration of calcium homeostasis. Serum BGP may be a potential marker of bone growth in premature neonates.\r"

All patients who had SCA involving 7p13, 11q23-24, or 12p11-13, and patients with a Philadelphia chromosome had high PE values. The S phase percentage, expression of CD19 antigen, and relapse status were also correlated with PE. Significantly, colony blasts had slightly different surface marker profiles in each case and were common ALL antigen negative in 33% of cases, which indicates the existence of a marked immunological heterogeneity at the level of leukemic progenitor cells.\r"

Reduced cellular reactivity, which exists in a high proportion of such patients, can be attributed to a failure of the monocyte population to support the process of primary T cell activation in vitro. This defect results in a lack of interleukin 2 production, which is critically dependent on a monocyte-derived signal. In contrast, T lymphocyte function was found to be physiologic. Perhaps more important, the degree of monocyte dysfunction in vitro correlated with the same patients' in vivo responses to hepatitis B vaccination. Addition of recombinant human interleukin 2 fully reconstituted their deficient immune response in vitro.\r"

Among these interacting cells are monocytes and/or macrophages. Monocytes are capable of producing both interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These two factors display a positive influence on T cell colony formation. Recombinant IL-1 and recombinant TNF were both shown to stimulate T cell colony growth in a dose-dependent manner, and this stimulation could be blocked by prior incubation with anti-IL-1 or anti-TNF, respectively. In addition, conditioned medium obtained from monocytes cultured in the presence of endotoxin also stimulated T cell colony formation. This stimulation by monocyte-conditioned medium was partially suppressed by incubation with anti-TNF or anti-IL-1, while incubation with both antibodies together displayed greater suppression. In conclusion, monocytes produce at least two factors, IL-1 and TNF, which can stimulate T cell colony formation by peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, the gene for a novel mammalian hematopoietic growth factor homologous to murine interleukin 3 was isolated from a gibbon T cell line and expressed in monkey COS cells. The factor, termed multi-colony stimulating factor (multi-CSF) or interleukin 3, is stimulatory to human target cells. We investigated the range of enriched human bone marrow and fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors responsive to multi-CSF; compared the colony types observed with those obtained in the presence of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF); and analyzed the effects on colony formation of combining multi-CSF with GM-CSF or granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF). The results show that multi-CSF acts as a multipoietin. Alone it stimulates the formation of colonies derived from granulocyte, macrophage, eosinophil, and megakaryocyte progenitors. In combination with erythropoietin it supports the development of both erythroid and mixed colonies. Furthermore, the data show that multi-CSF is a more potent stimulus of erythroid progenitors than GM-CSF. In combination with G-CSF multi-CSF substantially increases granulocyte colony number over the number obtained with each factor alone. We conclude that multi-CSF may prove to have important therapeutic potential in vivo as a stimulus for hematopoiesis.\r"

When EC supernatant, containing 2.8-11.0 U/dl of von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and vWF multimeric forms larger than those present in normal plasma, was the red blood cell (RBC)-suspending medium instead of serum-free medium (SFM), the adhesion of sickle RBC, but not normal RBC, to endothelial cells was greatly increased (range of enhancement of sickle RBC adhesion, 2- to 27-fold). Adhesion of sickle RBC to endothelial cells was reduced to near serum-free levels when EC supernatant was immunologically depleted of vWF forms. Sickle RBC suspended in SFM containing 200 U/dl of purified vWF multimers of the type found in normal human plasma or 300 micrograms/ml human fibronectin were only slightly more adhesive to endothelial cells than sickle RBC suspended in SFM alone. These data indicate that unusually large vWF multimers produced by endothelial cells are potent mediators of the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells. Vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell anemia may be caused, at least in part, by adhesive interactions between the abnormal surfaces of sickle RBC and the endothelium after the release of unusually large vWF multimeric forms from stimulated or damaged endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is a T cell neoplasm etiologically associated with human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. ATL cells often abnormally express interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors, and ATL patients may show clinical evidence of hypercalcemia, osteolytic bone lesions, or increased bone turnover. Whereas interleukin 1 (IL-1) is not generally recognized as a product of T cells, this cytokine is capable of both altering IL-2 receptor expression and activating osteoclasts. Thus, we investigated the possibility that primary ATL leukemic T cells and HTLV-I-infected long-term ATL cell lines produce IL-1. S1 nuclease protection assays demonstrated that primary leukemic ATL cells from five out of six patients, as well as one patient with T4+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia, contained considerable quantities of IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) and small amounts of IL-1 alpha mRNA. These primary leukemic T cells also released biologically active IL-1 protein as evaluated in the murine thymocyte comitogenesis bioassay. In contrast to primary tumor cells, four out of six long-term ATL cell lines produced variable amounts of IL-1 alpha mRNA in the absence of detectable IL-1 beta mRNA as measured by S1 nuclease protection. These data demonstrate that IL-1 gene (especially IL-1 beta) expression occurs in many primary HTLV-I-infected leukemic T cells raising the possibility that this mediator may play a role in the pathological changes associated with this leukemia. Also, these studies show that the pattern of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta gene expression differs between primary ATL tumor cells and long-term cultured ATL cell lines, indicating an interesting biological difference in these two HTLV-I-infected cell populations.\r"

Serial jejunal biopsy specimens were taken from five treated coeliac patients for six hours after a gluten challenge. In four of these five infiltration of the surface epithelium by both T cell phenotypes, together with deterioration in the villus architecture, had occurred both within two hours of having started the challenge. This suggests that T lymphocytes may have a role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.\r"

Fc receptor blockade was more commonly detected in sera from patients with stage B rather than stage A CLL (Binet classification), though this did not achieve significance beyond the 90% level, and it was noted in 62.5% of those with lymphocyte doubling times of less than one year, compared with 36.3% of those whose lymphocyte doubling time was more than one year. The results indicate that autologous Fc receptor blocking antibody activity occurs in sera from patients with CLL, is more likely to be generated by the tumour itself than by allogeneic stimulation, and is associated with increased tumour load. Such antibodies may permit tolerance of tumour by the host.\r"

Myocardial infarction was defined by a concordant reduction in segmental perfusion and glucose utilization, and myocardial ischemia was identified by preservation of glucose utilization in segments with rest hypoperfusion. Of the 51 segments studied, 36 had a fixed thallium defect, 11 had a partially reversible defect and 4 had a completely reversible defect. Only 15 (42%) of the 36 segments with a fixed defect and 4 (36%) of the 11 segments with a partially reversible defect exhibited myocardial infarction on study with positron tomography. In contrast, residual myocardial glucose utilization was identified in the majority of segments with a fixed (58%) or a partially reversible (64%) thallium defect. All of the segments with a completely reversible defect appeared normal on positron tomography. Apparent improvement in the thallium defect on delayed images did not distinguish segments with ischemia from infarction. Thus, positron emission tomography reveals evidence of persistent tissue metabolism in the majority of segments with a fixed or partially resolving stress thallium defect, implying that markers of perfusion alone may underestimate the extent of viable tissue in hypoperfused myocardial segments.\r"

In untreated mice, absolute GCT volume and the frequency of cells strongly immunostained for EGF increased with age. Concentrations of EGF rose fourfold. Both T3 and DHT had inductive effects at each age: GCT cells were enlarged, contained more granules, and stained very strongly for EGF; EGF concentrations and the volume of GCTs also increased. However, the pattern of induction differed with age for the two hormones. After T3 treatment EGF concentration declined with age with respect to the degree of induction over same age control levels. By contrast, after DHT treatment the level of induction of EGF over control levels was the same at all three ages. The pattern of aging of GCT cells and their responsiveness to T3 or DHT in female mice differ from that previously reported for males.\r"

  ".W": "Although type 2 antigens, such as PVP, generally do not activate specific TH, previous studies have established that low doses of PVP (0.0025 microgram) can activate TH in vivo which provide help in primed B cells for PVP-specific IgG responses. Doses of PVP that are optimally immunogenic for IgM antibody production (0.25 to 25 micrograms) preferentially activate PVP-specific TS, which suppress IgG antibody production. In the studies reported here, TH and TS that regulate PVP-specific IgG antibody responses were activated in vitro by culturing normal spleen cells for 4 days with PVP. Induction of the TH and TS is dependent upon the amount of PVP in culture: 10(-4) micrograms PVP activates TH, whereas 10(-2) micrograms PVP preferentially activates TS. TH induced in vitro express Thy-1, L3T4, and I-A determinants and help provided by these TH is similar in magnitude to that provided by TH from mice primed with 0.0025 microgram PVP in vivo. TH can also be activated in vitro if donor mice are treated with Cy before culture of their spleen cells with 10(-2) micrograms PVP. Cy pretreatment prevents TS activation, and TH are then induced in these cultures. The presence of TS does not prevent activation of TH by 10(-2) micrograms PVP, because removal of TS by treatment of T cells with anti-Lyt-2 + complement at the end of culture uncovers TH activity. This TH activity is comparable with that of TH obtained after culture with 10(-4) micrograms PVP. The ability to activate PVP-specific TH and TS in vitro should allow determination of the mechanisms involved in activation of T cells by type 2 antigens and the mechanisms by which TS and TH interact with one another.\r"

A human-human hybridoma, constructed from an Epstein-Barr virus transformed tonsil B cell that secreted IgA anti-phosphorycholine (PC) and a human plasmacytoma cell, was utilized to examine this issue. The cloned hybridoma expressed membrane IgA and secreted IgA specific for PC. Stimulation of the hybridoma cells with PC conjugated to Sepharose beads (PC-Sepharose) but not glycine-conjugated Sepharose resulted in an increase in DNA synthesis. Affinity purified goat anti-human IgA bound to Sepharose also augmented DNA synthesis. Soluble PC did not increase DNA synthesis and inhibited the increase in DNA synthesis resulting from PC-Sepharose. IgA secretion was augmented in response to PC-Sepharose, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of Ig-secreting cells detected by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and by quantitation of the IgA secreted per cell by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mitogen-stimulated T cell supernatants increased IgA secretion of the hybridoma cells but did not cause synergistic stimulation of the cells in the presence of PC-Sepharose. These data indicate that Sepharose-bound antigen was sufficient to induce proliferation and augment IgA secretion by this membrane IgA anti-PC-bearing hybridoma. The results suggest that cross-linking of membrane IgA by specific antigen may be a sufficient stimulus for proliferation and differentiation of B cells at this stage of maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of B lymphocytes in young New Zealand Black (NZB) mice proceeds at an accelerated rate resulting in a deficiency of B lineage precursors in adult (greater than 15 wk old) animals. To study the characteristics of B lineage cells in young (4 wk) and old (6 mo) NZB mice, bone marrow from these animals was used to initiate long term lymphoid bone marrow cultures (LBMC) that permit the long term maintenance of B cells and their precursors. Age-matched cultures from BALB/c mice and NZB.xid marrow were established in parallel. Primary LBMC were readily established from these strains and showed similar patterns of growth for the 3-mo observation period. No significant differences in numbers of 14.8 positive cells were observed. However, NZB mice at both ages had a higher percentage of membrane IgM (mIgM)-expressing cells. Significant levels of supernatant IgM were found only in cultures of 6-mo NZB and BALB/c mice; levels were highest in NZB culture supernatants and were often more than 500 ng/ml; significant, although much lower, levels of IgG were likewise detected. Lymphoid cells from NZB.xid mice were unable to generate significant levels of IgM in supernatant fluids indicating the effects of the xid gene were displayed in vitro. Autoantibodies were not detected in any of the culture supernatants. Additional evidence for NZB hyperactivity in primary B lymphopoiesis was observed upon initiation of primary myeloid bone marrow cultures (MBMC) from these strains of mice and subsequently transferring them to LBMC conditions. This results in the cessation of myelopoiesis at the initiation of B lymphopoiesis. At the time of converting MBMC to LBMC, cultures of NZB and BALB/c mice morphologically resembled myeloid cultures and had neither B cell colony-forming units nor cells that expressed 14.8 or mIgM. However, following the switch, NZB mice had a 5-fold higher number of B cell colony-forming units. Further, MBMC established from NZB bone marrow cells had a reduced capacity to form colonies in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit assay. These studies indicate that defects of NZB hemopoietic cells are manifest in vitro and suggest the use of in vitro long term cultures as a valuable technique to further dissect the hematopoietic abnormalities of NZB mice and possible underlying microenvironmental defects.\r"

To determine whether the treatment in vivo with anti-IA antibodies is haplotype-specific, we studied the development of EAE in F1 (SJL/J X BALB/c) mice following anti-IA antibody therapy. We report that treatment of animals with monoclonal antibody directed against the high responder allele product, I-As, was successful in preventing disease when therapy was begun either at the time of immunization with antigen, or following passive transfer of MBP-sensitized T cells. Therapy with antibody directed to the low responder allele product (I-Ad), while effective when used at the time of immunization with antigen, was ineffective following passive transfer of MBP-sensitized lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of age on the ability to elicit the various immune functions comprising experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in mice has been examined. Compared with young mice (2 to 3 mo), CBA/CaJ and A/J aged mice (20 to 30 mo) show a drastic reduction in their ability to develop circulating antibody after injection of mouse thyroglobulin (MTg) or mouse thyroid extract (MTE) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses were also depressed, as well as the ability of aged lymph node cells to proliferate in vitro to antigen and the ability of aged splenic T cells to function as helper cells for in vitro antibody production. However, after injection of these thyroid antigens in CFA, aged mice developed thyroid lesions either comparable to or only slightly less intense than those observed in young mice. The disparity between the levels of immune responses and thyroid lesions observed in aged mice can be explained by the greater susceptibility of aged thyroids to tissue damage, since transfer of identical numbers of Con A-activated MTE-primed young splenocytes to young and aged recipients results in a more severe thyroiditis in the aged recipients. Priming mice to MTE in CFA at 9 mo of age, at which time mice are responsive to MTE, did not enhance either T or B cell responsiveness to injection of MTE in CFA at 24 mo of age. Lymphocytes from MTE-injected aged mice also failed to transfer thyroiditis to young recipients after in vitro activation of the lymphocytes with Con A.\r"

  ".W": "The BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) rat provides a good model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. There are several sublines of the BB/Wor rat. The diabetes prone (DP) sublines develop diabetes at a frequency of 50 to 80% from 60 to 120 days of age. The DP rats are lymphopenic, have a severe deficit in phenotypic OX 19+ OX 8+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc), and lack RT 6.1 T cells. These rats have a relative increase in OX 19- OX 8+ natural killer (NK) cells and in NK activity as compared with the diabetes resistant (DR) sublines. The DR sublines have a normal complement of phenotypic Tc and RT 6.1 T cells, fewer NK cells, and lower NK activity than the DP rat. The ability to elicit functional Tc in the BB/Wor rat has not been well studied. In these experiments, by using a model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in DP and DR rats, we have studied the functional activity of Tc in these lines. Seven days after infection with LCMV, DR rats develop lymphocytes which are cytotoxic for LCMV-infected syngeneic fibroblasts. These cytotoxic lymphocytes are phenotypic Tc (OX 19+ OX 8+), and do not kill Pichinde virus-infected syngeneic fibroblasts or LCMV-infected allogeneic fibroblasts. This cytotoxic activity is accompanied by an increase in phenotypic Tc from 17 to 33%. DP rats produced neither functional nor phenotypic Tc. These studies confirm that NK cells are the predominant cytotoxic lymphocyte in the BB/Wor rat and suggest that these rats may not utilize a Tc mechanism in islet destruction or another immunologic process such as graft rejection.\r"

  ".U": "87309753\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously identified two BCGF II-like factors which can be distinguished by their differential reactivity in several murine BCGF II assays. Prototype sources of these two factors are a partially purified preparation derived from PHA-P-stimulated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (designated human BCGF), and supernatant from antigen-stimulated D10.G4.1 murine T cells (designated D10 sup). Extending the characterization of these two factors, we show here that human BCGF and D10 sup both cause tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation and IgM secretion by T cell-depleted, in vivo-activated, large murine B cells. In contrast, only the human BCGF consistently induced proliferation and IgM secretion by T cell-depleted, small murine B cells. When simultaneously added to cultures, D10 sup and human BCGF synergized to produce optimal IgM secretion by large murine B cells and murine BCL1 B lymphoma cells. The same factors were tested in an IgM-specific plaque assay, and a similar synergistic response was observed for the large B cells, but not for the BCL1 cells. The combination of factors also produced maximal [3H]TdR incorporation by large murine B cells. In contrast, the addition of human BCGF totally abrogated D10 sup-induced BCL1 proliferation. Together, these data suggest that the synergies observed in IgM secretion result from an increased production of plaque-forming cells (PFC) in cultures of large B cells and an increase in IgM production per responding cell in BCL1 cells. Kinetic analysis of the time of action of the two BCGF II-like lymphokines in the induction of the PFC response by large B cells indicated that human BCGF was required within the first 24 hr of a 4-day culture period, while D10 sup could be added as late as the final 15 hr without significant diminution of the response. In summary, these data provide further support for the existence of two distinct B cell stimulatory factors which cause growth and differentiation of activated B cells, and indicate that these two factors synergize to produce optimal Ig secretion. For ease of discussion, the activity in the human BCGF preparation is referred to as BCGF IIA, and the activity in D10 sup is referred to as BCGF IIB.\r"

No endothelial staining was detectable before culture. Interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide each induced 2+ to 3+ H4/18 staining of microvascular endothelium at 6 hr. Combining mediators produced additive (3+ to 4+) effects, and reactivity was lost or markedly diminished by 24 hr. Incubation with culture medium alone resulted in 1+ to 2+ H4/18 staining at 6 hr, and medium conditioned by cultured foreskins, but not mock-conditioned medium, could induce H4/18 binding in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The spontaneous expression of microvascular staining in the foreskins was markedly inhibited by cyclosporin A, but not polymyxin B sulfate or dexamethasone; cyclosporin A did not inhibit induction of staining by exogenous mediators. Both light level and immunoultrastructural studies demonstrated H4/18 expression to be associated predominantly with postcapillary venular endothelial cells of the superficial vascular plexus. We conclude that microvascular endothelium of skin can undergo activation in response to exogenous and endogenous cytokines, with the greatest changes occurring in those portions of the vessels most involved in leukocyte and lymphocyte trafficking.\r"

  ".W": "The dominant T cell determinant on moth and pigeon cytochromes c in B10.A (E beta k:E alpha k) mice is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, contained within residues 93-103 or 93-104. Thirty-seven antigen analogs, containing single amino acid substitutions at positions 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, and 104, were synthesized. The effects of the substitutions on in vitro antigenicity and in vivo immunogenicity were determined. Functional assays with T cell clones identified residues 99, 101, 102, and 103 as critical, based on their effect on antigenic potency. Peptides containing substitutions at residues 99, 101, and 102 were capable of eliciting unique clones upon immunization of B10.A mice. This was consistent with the identification of these residues as part of the epitope, the site on the antigen that interacts with the T cell receptor. Immunization with peptides substituted at residue 103, however, failed to elicit clones with unique specificity for the immunogen. When these peptides were tested for their ability to stimulate the T cell clones with antigen-presenting cells from B10.A(5R) mice expressing the E beta b:E alpha k Ia molecule, a consistent change in the relative antigenic potency was observed with 50% of the peptides. The effect of the Ia molecule on the antigenic potency ruled out the possibility that residue 103 nonspecifically affected antigen uptake or processing and identified residue 103 as part of the agretope, the site that interacts with the Ia molecule. The locations of the agretope and the epitope on this antigenic determinant appear to be fixed, even in the presence of large numbers of amino acid substitutions. However, some substitutions were found to affect both the agretope and the epitope, placing limits on the functional independence of the two sites. The results are discussed in terms of the trimolecular complex model of T cell activation and the implications of these data for antigen-Ia molecule interactions.\r"

Antigen presentation was assessed by measurement of lymphokine released by antigen-specific T cell hybridomas. Depending on the experimental conditions, the crosslinked antibodies decreased the amount of antigen required to give a response by the hybridomas by factors of 10(2) to 10(3). Enhanced presentation occurred when antigen was targeted to MHC class I and class II molecules, surface immunoglobulin, or Fc gamma receptors on the surface of the murine B cell lymphoma-hybridoma, TA3. An enhancement of antigen presentation also occurred when antigen was targeted to surface IgD, or class I and class II MHC molecules on murine splenic B cells, and when antigen was targeted to class I and class II molecules on irradiated adherent spleen cells. No response was seen when antigen was targeted to Fc gamma R on B cells or adherent spleen cells. The ability of each crosslinked antibody to enhance presentation paralleled the total amount of each that bound to the surface of the antigen-presenting cells. Antigen presentation, mediated by crosslinked antibody, was antigen-specific and I-A restricted. The presentation of one antigen by using crosslinked antibody did not result in enhanced presentation of a second, bystander antigen. These results suggest that a novel means of stimulating immune responses may be possible in vivo, by targeting antigen to surface structures on antigen-presenting cells.\r"

  ".W": "The acidic glycosphingolipid, ganglioside GM1, which is the binding site for cholera toxin on many cell types, was identified by chemical and by flow cytometric analyses of mouse interleukin 3-dependent, bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC). Ganglioside GM1 and other acidic glycosphingolipids were isolated from BMMC by chloroform/methanol extraction and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The presence of ganglioside GM1 in the BMMC extract was demonstrated by its co-migration with ganglioside GM1 standard in thin layer chromatography and by the binding of peroxidase-labeled cholera toxin B subunit to both molecules. As assessed by fluorescence flow cytometric analysis of the binding of fluorescein-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, the majority of BMMC expressed ganglioside GM1 on their surface, and the total presentation per cell increased as cells progressed from the G1 to S to G2 + M phases of the cell cycle. The addition of increasing amounts of cholera toxin starting with 0.08 microgram/ml to BMMC cultured in 50% WEHI 3-conditioned medium containing IL 3 for 48 hr caused the adhesion of BMMC to the tissue culture flasks to increase in a dose-related manner, from less than 1% adherent cells in cultures without toxin to a plateau value of approximately 17% adherent in the presence of 1.25 micrograms/ml of toxin. The histamine content of BMMC increased from 26.7 +/- 3.59 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SD, n = 4) for control cultures to 201 +/- 17.4 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SD, n = 4) for nonadherent cells and to 588 +/- 89.4 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SD, n = 4) for adherent cells after 48 hr of culture in 0.31 microgram/ml cholera toxin, which was the optimal dose for nonadherent and adherent populations. The content of another preformed intragranular mediator, beta-hexosaminidase, did not increase appreciably in the presence of cholera toxin (n = 3). The increase in the histamine content of BMMC after the addition of 0.31 microgram/ml cholera toxin was detectable at 4 hr, plateaued by 24 to 48 hr, and gradually declined over the next 6 days. Cholera toxin also augmented the histamine content of BMMC in the presence of purified synthetic IL 3. Preincubation of whole cholera toxin with purified ganglioside GM1 inhibited the histamine-augmenting effects of cholera toxin on BMMC, indicating that the effect was not due to a contaminant, and neither the A nor B subunit of cholera toxin alone increased the histamine content of BMMC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The data presented here indicate that a protein of m.w. 78,000 (pp78) co-immunoprecipitates with gp57Tac when a monoclonal antibody against gp57Tac is used. The 78 kd molecule is phosphorylated in vitro within the immune complex only in the presence of exogenously added IL 2, whereas the 57 kd molecule is phosphorylated equally in the presence or absence of IL 2. Phosphorylation in vitro of pp78 was demonstrated in extracts of human peripheral blood T cells (PBL-T) and the human T cell line Jurkat, but not in extracts of the human macrophage line U937 or the murine T cell line 2.8.2. Metabolic phosphorylation in intact cells reflects results observed in vitro; both pp78 and gp57Tac are phosphorylated in PBL-T and Jurkat, but not in U937. These data demonstrate that the IL 2 receptor complex contains an IL 2 responsive protein kinase activity and may signal the cell through a phosphorylation event.\r"

In vivo stimulated blast T cells were isolated for comparison. RNA extracted from highly purified blast cell populations elicited in vivo was probed for TCR transcripts by Northern blot analysis. In contrast to the blast T cells which expressed high levels of the alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon genes, blast NK cells expressed very low to not detectable levels of these genes. Blast NK cells isolated from euthymic mice were comparable to those isolated from athymic mice and both populations had profoundly reduced levels of transcripts for TCR genes. The expression of gamma-chain genes was extremely low in the in vivo elicited blast T cells as well as the blast NK cells. Highly purified NK cells isolated from unmanipulated mice and propagated in culture with recombinant interleukin 2 for short periods of time also had extremely low levels of delta and epsilon, whereas T cells expanded in culture had high level expression of these genes. As delta and epsilon appear to be required for expression of a functional recognition structure on the T cell surface and are expressed early in T cell ontogeny, these results indicate that the functional NK cells responding to proliferation signals do not form a conventional T cell recognition structure. Furthermore, the results support a separation of the T cell and NK cell lineages early in ontogeny.\r"

This question was addressed by investigating the effect of three individually derived anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies (mAb) on purified human B cells (less than 1.5% T cells) stimulated by either the T-independent mitogen Staphylococcus aureus or the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The three anti-HLA class I antibodies, whether specific for gene products of the HLA-A locus (mAb 131), HLA-B locus (mAb 4E), or HLA-A, -B, and -C locus (mAb W6/32), inhibited S. aureus-induced proliferation by 70 to 90%. This inhibition was significant over a 5-day culture period, was not altered by the addition of exogenous interleukin 2 or B cell growth factor, and was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity. In addition, the inhibition of proliferation was unchanged when the mAb were added 12 hr after the initiation of culture. The proliferative response was not affected by either of the control antibodies OKB7 and R3-367. In contrast with S. aureus-stimulated B cells, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced proliferation was resistant to the inhibitory activity of HLA class I-specific antibodies. These results suggest that HLA class I molecules are involved in human B lymphocyte proliferation and may regulate a critical event preceding the upregulation of protein kinase C activity.\r"

Although BALB/c (H-2d) is resistant to EAE through use of an identical immunization protocol, (BALB/c x SJL/J)F1 hybrid mice develop EAE after immunization with BP. T cell clones specific for BP have been isolated from a highly encephalitogenic line of (BALB/c x SJL/J)F1 hybrid T cells raised against bovine BP. The clones were examined for their H-2 restriction and specificity for heterologous forms of BP (mouse, rat, and bovine BP). The results revealed the clones cross-reacting with mouse (self) BP were almost always restricted to F1 hybrid class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) elements. In contrast, mouse cross-reactive clones derived from a nonencephalitogenic (BALB/c x SJL/J) T cell line raised against rat BP were largely restricted to H-2d elements. These clones did not cross-react with bovine BP. Four additional lines were generated by carrying the original rat and bovine F1 T cell lines on parental antigen-presenting cells thus generating lines biased toward homozygous (SJL/J, H-2s, or BALB/c, H-2d) restriction elements. These \"parentally restricted\" T cell lines did not induce EAE when injected in vivo. These results suggest that in this F1 strain sensitivity to T cell-induced EAE is associated with epitopes on murine BP that associate with F1 class II MHC restricting elements. In contrast, nonencephalitogenic T cell lines contain a high proportion of murine cross-reactive clones restricted to H-2d, the haplotype of the classically resistant BALB/c mouse. This work illustrates the use of T cell lines and clones in a model system to further analyze the role of MHC restriction elements in autoimmune disease occurring in heterozygous individuals.\r"

In experiments here described, we have demonstrated that recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulates the adhesion of T lymphocytes to confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein EC. The increase in adhesion induced by TNF was EC-specific inasmuch as preincubation of the lymphocytes with TNF did not alter binding, and preincubation of human dermal fibroblasts with TNF did not increase their inherently low adhesiveness for lymphocytes. Stimulation of T-EC binding occurred after treatment of the EC with as little as 0.01 U/ml (1 pg/ml) of TNF. In kinetic experiments, preincubation of EC with TNF for 4 hr resulted in optimal adhesion. TNF-treated EC retained their increased adhesiveness after fixation with paraformaldehyde, suggesting that TNF stimulated binding by increasing the expression or accessibility of EC surface receptors for lymphocytes. Although antibodies to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 alpha- or beta-chains on the T cell markedly inhibited unstimulated T-EC binding, such antibodies had no effect on the increase in EC adhesiveness induced by TNF, indicating that the increased binding resulted from the generation of an alternate binding receptor on the EC membrane. These findings provide additional evidence that cytokines participate in the mobilization of mononuclear cells in the chronic inflammatory reaction by stimulation of the adhesiveness of endothelium for circulating lymphocytes.\r"

The recovery of total nucleated bone marrow cells and of hematopoietic progenitor cells was enhanced in IL-1 treated, as compared to untreated, irradiated mice. This suggested that IL-1 administration may affect the cells in the bone marrow of normal mice. Intraperitoneal administration of recombinant IL-1 resulted in bone marrow cell enlargement and increased cycling of these enlarged cells. In addition, the capacity of bone marrow cells from IL-1 treated mice to proliferate in response to granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in cell suspension cultures was enhanced. The above effects were not genetically restricted as C57BL/6, B6D2F1, C3H/HeN, and C3H/HeJ mice showed similar responses. A comparative study showed that 100 ng of IL-1 was much more effective in stimulating bone marrow cells by the above criteria than 5 micrograms GM-CSF. Since IL-1, unlike CSF, can not be demonstrated to have a direct in vitro stimulatory effect on bone marrow cells, the aforementioned in vivo effects of IL-1 are presumably mediated by other hematopoietic growth factors. We have previously shown that IL-1 induces the appearance of high titers of CSF in the serum. Consequently hematopoietic growth factors that are generated at local sites following IL-1 administration may mediate the observed cell cycling effect.\r"

In this study, IL-2 was directly assessed for its ability to inhibit in vitro granulocyte and/or macrophage colony-forming cell formation (GM-CFC/M-CFC). C57BL/6 bone marrow cells were cultured with different colony-stimulating factors (CSF), i.e., partially purified macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) or recombinant granulocyte and macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) in the presence or absence of different IL-2 preparations. Partially purified mouse IL-2 or recombinant human or mouse IL-2 (rHuIL-2 and rMuIL-2) totally inhibit GM-CFC and M-CFC formation at 7 days of culture. The level of inhibition mediated by IL-2 was concentration-dependent, with as little as 1 U/ml giving total inhibition of colony formation. The ability of IL-2 to inhibit colony formation was completely abolished by treatment with antisera to IL-2. MuIFN-alpha/beta and MuIFN-gamma appeared to play no role in IL-2-induced myelo-suppression in that addition of antisera to these IFN failed to block IL-2-induced suppression. Myelo-suppression mediated by IL-2 was independent of the concentration of CSF used in the bone marrow cultures. Suppression was also not dependent upon the initial presence of T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Bone marrow cells depleted of Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, Lyt-2+, NK-1.1+, Asialo GM1+, or Qa-5+ cells were as susceptible to IL-2 induced suppression as untreated or complement-treated bone marrow cells. These results suggest that IL-2 may play an important role in regulating different aspects of hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of the tumor necrosis factors, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, products of activated macrophages and lymphocytes, respectively, to stimulate interleukin 1 (IL-1) release from endothelial cells derived from human umbilical veins was examined in vitro. Recombinant TNF-alpha caused IL-1 release by 4 hr with maximal levels of 17 U/ml by 24 hr; half-maximal stimulation occurred at approximately 80 pM. In contrast, recombinant TNF-beta was a relatively poor stimulus for IL-1 release. Even at concentrations as high as 600 pM, only 3 U of IL-1/ml were recovered; maximal IL-1 release (10 to 12 U/ml) required up to 5 nM TNF-beta. Natural, glycosated human TNF-beta was comparable in activity to recombinant TNF-beta. TNF-beta did not directly inhibit the IL-1 comitogenesis assay, nor was there evidence that TNF-beta induced the release of an IL-1 inhibitor, in that supernatants generated in the presence of TNF-beta did not inhibit thymocyte proliferation to a recombinant IL-1 standard. Binding of the recombinant TNF to endothelial monolayers was assessed by using [125I]TNF-alpha in competition studies with cold TNF-alpha and TNF-beta. Binding of TNF-alpha was half-maximal at 80 pM with an average of 664 receptors/cell and Kd = 0.043 nM. Although TNF-beta was capable of fully competing for [125I]TNF-alpha binding, half-maximal binding occurred at 800 pM TNF-beta. These data suggest that the TNF receptors on human endothelial cells may reflect the structural differences between these two homologous cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays an important role in host defense mechanisms by increasing body temperature, inducing the synthesis of a variety of lymphokines and hepatic acute phase proteins and acting as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes. However, in some microenvironments such as injured tissue or joint spaces, elevated IL-1 levels may contribute to pathologic processes, for example, proliferation and fibrosis of tissue involved in pannus formation as well as degradation of matrix and abnormal tissue architecture. To investigate potential mechanisms that may lead to excessive production of IL-1, we have examined the ability of IL-1 to participate in an amplification event by inducing its own gene expression leading to synthesis of biologically active IL-1. When injected into rabbits, recombinant human IL-1-alpha induced biphasic fevers, and during the second temperature elevation 3 hr later, a circulating pyrogenic material was detected by passive transfer of plasma to other rabbits. Induction of the biphasic fever was not caused by endotoxin contamination of the recombinant IL-1. The 3-hr circulating pyrogen was heat-labile and was not residual injected IL-1-alpha. Chromatographic separation of this plasma and biologic assay suggested that it was new IL-1 of rabbit origin. We next incubated human blood mononuclear cells with recombinant IL-1-alpha and measured the intracellular and extracellular levels of IL-1 by bioassay using the D10.G4.1 murine T cell line. In order to control for the carryover of recombinant IL-1-alpha used to stimulate the mononuclear cells (MNC), we used neutralizing antibodies that were specific for IL-1-alpha or IL-1-beta. The results of these neutralizations showed that recombinant human IL-1-alpha induces the synthesis of IL-1-beta in human MNC in vitro. These results were verified with a radioimmunoassay specific for IL-1-beta. At concentrations of 100 ng/ml, IL-1-alpha induced prostaglandin E2 production in the MNC culture, and this was associated with decreased production of immunoreactive IL-1-beta. Adding indomethacin to the cultures prevented the decreased production of IL-1-beta induced by high concentrations of IL-1-alpha. Using nonadherent MNC, we observed an increase in IL-1-beta as well as IL-1-alpha mRNA after 4 hr of exposure to recombinant IL-1-alpha. These results demonstrate that IL-1-alpha induces biologically active and immunoreactive IL-1-beta from MNC in vitro and that the same concentrations of IL-1-alpha induce gene expression for both forms of IL-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) alters several potentially pathogenic endothelial cell (EC) functions. The authors report here that recombinant human IL-1 (rIL-1) alpha (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) or IL-1-beta (1 to 100 ng/ml) induce concentration- and time-dependent increases in IL-1-beta mRNA levels in EC derived from adult human saphenous vein. rIL-1 induced IL-1-alpha mRNA only in EC treated concomitantly with cycloheximide (2 micrograms/ml). IL-1-beta mRNA production began within 1 hr of exposure to rIL-1, peaked after 24 hr, and declined thereafter. Actinomycin D prevented the appearance of IL-1 mRNA in rIL-1-treated EC. rIL-1 also induced the release of biologically active IL-1 from EC, which was inhibited by cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml). When compared on the basis of their activity in the thymocyte costimulation assay, rIL-1-alpha and rIL-1-beta were equipotent as inducers of IL-1 production by EC. EC stimulated with rIL-1 produced prostaglandin E2, which inhibits IL-1 production by other cell types and also decreases the responsiveness of thymocytes to IL-1. When EC were exposed to rIL-1 in the presence of indomethacin (1 microgram/ml), which blocked prostaglandin E2 production, greater amounts of rIL-1-induced IL-1 release were detected, although the inhibitor did not affect IL-1-beta mRNA levels. IL-1-induced IL-1 production was unlikely to be caused by endotoxin contamination of tissue culture media or IL-1 preparations, because the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antagonist polymyxin B (10 micrograms/ml) blocked LPS-induced IL-1 production by EC but did not affect IL-1 release in response to rIL-1-beta (100 ng/ml). The IL-1-inducing property of rIL-1-beta was heat-labile, whereas heated LPS stimulated EC IL-1 production. The source of IL-1 in our cultures was not monocyte/macrophages, as treatment of EC with monoclonal antibody to the monocyte antigen Mo2 under conditions that lysed adherent peripheral blood monocytes did not affect production of IL-1 by EC in response to LPS (1 microgram/ml) or rIL-1-beta (100 ng/ml). IL-1 elicits a coordinated program of altered endothelial function that increases adhesiveness for leukocytes and coagulability. IL-1-induced IL-1 gene expression in human adult EC could thus provide a positive feedback mechanism in the pathogenesis of vascular disease including atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and allograft rejection.\r"

By using an ovalbumin-reactive T cell line (designated Hen-1), which does not produce BSF-1 following activation, it was possible to demonstrate that the antigen-specific proliferative response of trinitrophenyl (TNP)-binding B cells to TNP-ovalbumin required exogenous BSF-1 in addition to direct interaction with irradiated Hen-1 T cells. The activation obtained under these conditions was highly efficient, being sensitive to antigen doses as low as 0.001 microgram/ml. The addition of saturating amounts of BSF-1 did not alter the antigen-specificity or the requirements for hapten-carrier linkage or major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-B interaction in this system. The involvement of BSF-1 was confirmed by the ability of 11B11 anti-BSF-1 antibody to specifically suppress the response of TNP-binding B cells to TNP-ovalbumin, BSF-1, and irradiated Hen-1 T cells. Finally, this response was augmented by addition of the monokine interleukin 1. These data indicate that the proliferative response of small B cells to the thymus-dependent antigen and carrier-reactive T cell line used in our experiments can be regulated by the same factors that govern B cell proliferation induced by thymus-independent type 2 antigens or anti-IgM antibodies.\r"

At xyloside concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mM, CSPG synthesis was completely inhibited with marginal inhibition of protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect on CSPG synthesis was completely reversible. The number of class II molecules on the cell surface was not affected by xyloside, but biosynthesis and appearance of newly synthesized class II molecules at the cell surface were both decreased by xyloside. Recognition of influenza virus-infected cells by class II-restricted, virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes was not diminished by the presence of xyloside in the effector phase of the cytotoxicity assay. However, sensitization of target cells was markedly inhibited when target cells were exposed to virus in the presence of xyloside. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the CSPG form of invariant chain has a role in antigen processing.\r"

Normal adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Epstein-Barr virus secreted anti-PRP antibody with a frequency of 1/552 to 1/1190 relative to total Ig secreting cells; the frequency of AbSC to tetanus toxoid (TT) was 7.5 times higher (p less than 0.05). These frequencies did not change significantly after in vivo immunization, although the isotype distribution shifted toward increased IgG for TT and increased IgG and IgA for PRP. At 8 days postimmunization, spontaneous AbSC to PRP and TT were detected; frequencies for total anti-TT AbSC again being higher than anti-PRP, but there were significantly more IgA plaques among anti-PRP AbSC. Spontaneous AbSC were suppressed in culture by pokeweed mitogen and enhanced by cyclosporine. Three wk after in vivo immunization with PRP and TT, in vitro stimulation with pokeweed mitogen, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 bacteria, or antigen induced anti-TT but not anti-PRP in vitro antibody secretion, although Epstein-Barr virus induced both.

A cDNA clone, pR27, was isolated from a cDNA library constructed using mRNA from the T cell line RL-5. The pR27 insert was 1.9 kb long and included sequences that correspond to class I exons 2, 3, and 4 encoding external domains. Intron 4 sequence was found downstream followed by an unusually long 3' region which contained a sequence highly repeated in the rabbit genome. Although the pR27 exons encode structures typical of class I antigens, structural comparisons show no close relationship to other rabbit class I genes in the 3' regions, and no relationship to the 3' region of any murine gene including those encoded in the T1a region. By contrast, similarity of the 3' sequence has been found with human genes of the HLA-A type both by sequence comparison and by DNA hybridization studies. Southern blot analyses with a specific probe from this clone indicated that the gene encoding pR27 is present as a single copy in all rabbit DNA samples examined. Northern blot analysis and S1 nuclease mapping studies revealed that transcripts corresponding to pR27 are present in virally transformed T cell lines, thymus, and, to a lesser extent, in spleen and appendix but not in nonlymphoid tissue. The sizes of the detected transcripts (2.8 and 3.9 kb) were larger than that normally observed for a class I gene.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous report, we have demonstrated the induction of tumor-specific immunity by monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies generated against a monoclonal anti-tumor antibody, 11C1, that also cross-reacts with mouse mammary tumor virus envelope glycoprotein gp52. Also, we showed that whereas one anti-idiotype antibody, 2F10, could induce protective immunity, another anti-idiotype antibody, 3A4, induced nonprotective immunity. Here we demonstrated the existence of T helper cells which recognize anti-idiotypes that exert differential controls on tumor growth. The qualitative nature of idiotype recognizing T cells generated in response to 2F10, 3A4, irradiated tumor, and progressively growing tumor was compared. The reactivity pattern of idiotype recognizing T cells obtained from 2F10 and irradiated tumor immunized mice were similar in nature in the sense that Lyt-2- T cells obtained from these immunized mice responded to both 2F10 and 3A4 as antigen, although T cells from tumor immunized mice responded better to 3A4 antigen. On the other hand, the idiotype-recognizing T cells obtained from 3A4-immunized mice showed a similar reactivity pattern to T cells isolated from mice during the early phase of tumor growth (within day 4 to 5 after the inoculation of 10(4) live tumor cells). Lyt-2- T cells isolated from mice immunized with 3A4 or during the early phase of tumor growth responded only to 3A4 antigen. The inability of Lyt-2- T cells, isolated from 4- to 5-day-old tumor in mice, to cooperate with 2F10-TNP is not due to the absence of 2F10 idiotype recognizing T cells as 2F10 id recognizing T cells are present when examined at the precursor level. These data on the idiotype specificity of T helper cells show a correlation with the presence of anti-tumor immunity. This information will help in the design and application of idiotype vaccine in tumor immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were obtained from BALB/c mice immunized against either of two transplanted, chemically induced syngeneic sarcomas, MCA-1490 or MCA-1511. Two mAb, 4.72 and 5.96, were obtained, one from each immunization. They were found to have apparent anti-idiotypic specificity in that they, when injected s.c., primed naive BALB/c mice for delayed-type hypersensitivity that was specific for the immunizing tumor and required homology at genes linked to the Igh-1 allotype locus. Neither mAb bound tumor antigen. When mice with established transplants of MCA-1490 or MCA-1511 were treated by repeated i.p. injections of the appropriate anti-idiotypic mAb (4.72 and 5.96, respectively), a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed in those mice that had received the appropriate mAb. The idiotope defined by mAb 4.72 was expressed by T cells in mice responding to MCA-1490. mAb 4.72 bound to T cell suppressor factors that were specific for MCA-1490 and were derived from T cell hybridomas or sera of mice bearing MCA-1490. mAb 4.72 also bound to cells from lymph nodes draining the area of a growing MCA-1490 tumor. It was used, in combination with cell sorting, to establish a T cell line, which mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity to MCA-1490 and inhibited the outgrowth of MCA-1490 in BALB/c mice. Thus, mAb specific for idiotopes on T cells responding to syngeneic tumor antigen had both direct immunotherapeutic activity and could be used to establish cultures of tumor-reactive T cells.\r"

  ".W": "When UVB-irradiated urocanic acid, the putative photoreceptor/mediator for UVB suppression, is administered to mice it induces a dose-dependent suppression of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1), of similar magnitude to that induced by UV irradiation of mice. In this study, the efferent suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by UV-irradiated urocanic acid is demonstrated to be due to 2 phenotypically distinct T cells, (Thy1+, L3T4-, Ly2+) and (Thy1+, L3T4+, Ly2-). The suppression is specific for HSV-1. This situation parallels the generation of 2 distinct T-suppressor cells for HSV-1 by UV irradiation of mice and provides further evidence for the involvement of urocanic acid in the generation of UVB suppression.\r"

In childrens' sera, [\"Ab\"] can disagree between laboratories and between intralaboratory assays using different preparations of radioantigen. Immunochemical variables causing disagreement include the dilution of test serum at which [\"Ab\"] is assigned and the concentration and size distribution of radioantigen. Binding-dilution curves of many childrens' sera displayed shallower slopes than did the standard, thus [\"Ab\"] increased with dilution, particularly in low-binding sera. An increase in radioantigen concentration also raised [\"Ab\"]. Using larger-sized radioantigen raised the binding in standard and childrens' sera comparably and thus would not directly affect [\"Ab\"] but would raise [\"Ab\"] indirectly by increasing the serum dilution. These results are theoretically predicted if the affinity of childrens' antibodies are lower than that of the standard.\r"

Daily doses of 2 X 10(6) U of rHuIFN-beta/kg inhibited clinical disease in monkeys inoculated with simian varicella virus, and doses of DHPG between 20 and 60 mg/kg per day were necessary for similar antiviral effects. Intravenous administration of combinations of rHuIFN-beta and DHPG permitted an approximately 100-fold reduction in the effective dose of rHuIFN-beta and a 10-fold reduction in the effective dose of DHPG. Analysis of data relating to viremia by using the method of the median-effect principle showed the combination of rHuIFN-beta and DHPG was strongly synergistic in treatment of this infection.\r"

However, no support was obtained for the hypothesis that the metropolitan sample was feeling less communally supported than the rural sample, and the rates in a small county center proved to be lower than in the rural area, not higher as would be predicted on the assumption that its life is urban. Finally, the rural-metropolitan differences proved to be concentrated in two minorities, the unemployed men and the unpartnered women, rather than spread widely. It is suggested for these reasons that the traditional urban-rural dichotomy may now be inappropriate for sociopsychiatric research.\r"

Treatment was administered weekly for 6 weeks followed by a 2-week rest. Twenty-five patients were evaluable for response. Twelve of them had received previous combination chemotherapy that included 5-FU. Median age was 59 years, and median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 2. Three patients had partial responses and two of them had been treated previously with 5-FU. Twelve patients had stable disease. Five of these patients had subjective improvement with improved performance status and/or decreased dysphagia. The 95% confidence interval for response is 3% to 32%. Median survival time for all 28 patients enrolled in the study was 22 weeks. Toxicity was moderate and consisted primarily of diarrhea. Myelosuppression, skin rash, and increased lacrimation also occurred. Plasma concentrations of the active reduced folates, I-CF and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-CH3FH4), were greater than the 10 mumol/L levels that potentiate 5-FU activity in in vitro models, for more than four hours in all five patients in whom pharmacokinetics were studied. 5-FU and high-dose dl-CF has activity in patients with gastric carcinoma including patients who had previously progressed on 5-FU-containing combinations. Further study in a larger patient population is necessary to determine the usefulness of this regimen in gastric carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two consecutive patients with high-grade, B-cell lymphomas related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were accrued onto two sequential phase II studies, consisting of a standard regimen (M-BACOD, group no. 1, N = 13), or a novel, intensive regimen (group no. 2, N = 9), which included high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-Ara-C), and high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), in an attempt to prevent CNS relapse and improve response rates. Stage IV disease was present in 82%. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in seven of 13 patients (54%) in group no. 1, and in three of nine (33%) group no. 2 (P = NS). By multivariate analysis, the most significant factor in predicting response was a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) greater than 60 (P = .04). Three of the ten patients who achieved CR on either regimen have relapsed; in all, five of 13 patients (31%) in group no. 1 have achieved disease-free survival for more than 1 year, compared with one of nine (11%) in group no. 2. CNS progression occurred in six patients in group no. 2, and in two patients in group no. 1. Hematologic toxicity was significantly greater in group no. 2, and these patients had an increased risk of opportunistic infection (one in group no. 1 v seven in group no. 2; P less than .01). Survival was similar, with a median of 11 months in group no. 1 and 6 months in group no. 2. We conclude that the intensive regimen of combination chemotherapy described here is associated with significant risk of early death due to opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS-related lymphoma, and that progression in the CNS remains a major problem. Trials of combination chemotherapy of a less intensive nature, perhaps in combination with immunomodulators or antiretroviral agents should be explored.\r"

Many patients had liver (62%) and/or multisite metastases (53%), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) greater than 10 (76%), documented tumor progression before entry (51%), and tumor-related symptoms (36%), but also good performance status (84%). Prior therapy consisted of radiotherapy (RT) in 18%, chemotherapy in 22%, both in 4%, and none in 56%. There were 36% objective responses and 31% stabilization, which we believe is a significant change in the natural history of these patients. Median survival was 8 months. Improved survival was seen in patients with single- rather than multiple-site involvement. Decreasing CEA levels were seen in 59% (always in responders or patients with stable disease), and correlated with longer survival time (11.0 v 5.5 months, P = 0.01). Palliation of tumor related symptoms occurred in 75%, with or without antitumor effect. One patient with prior RT died of neutropenic sepsis after only the three-day load, so we now recommend only weekly therapy in previously radiated patients. Otherwise, toxicity was mild, manifest as weakness in 62%, nausea in 53%, or diarrhea in 47%, which was the most common dose-limiting side effect. The occurrence or absence of toxicity did not predict outcome. Because of equivalent efficacy, mild toxicity, and less expense, this regimen should be considered for patients who desire therapy.\r"

After extraction of the DNA, the degree of substitution of the thymidine by BUDR was determined by density gradient centrifugation. All the cell lines and tissues tested utilized both exogenous BUDR and endogenous thymidine sources to a similar extent. The relative utilization of the exogenous pathway could be manipulated by varying the exogenous concentration of BUDR. Our results demonstrate that one can predict the relative utilization of these two pathways and can calculate the effective specific activity of the intracellular thymidine nucleotide pool. Such information is needed in interpreting 11C-labeled thymidine uptake as measured by positron emission tomography.\r"

Carbon-14 leucine disappeared rapidly from plasma following intravenous injection and there was relatively selective uptake of the [14C]leucine and [14C]arginine by the parathyroid glands when compared with uptake by the thyroid gland and neck muscle. These data suggest that both agents warrant further investigation for their potential utility in positron emission tomographic scanning of the parathyroid gland.\r"

Total N, whey, casein, nonprotein nitrogen (NPN), cell N and N in the fat fraction were analyzed by micro-Kjeldahl analysis after a series of centrifugation and ultracentrifugation separations. Fresh milk samples (colostrum, transitional milk and mature milk) were centrifuged at 500 X g to separate milk cells and at 5000 X g to skim the milk. Decelled milk and skimmed milk were ultracentrifuged at 189,000 X g to separate fat and casein micelles from whey. NPN was analyzed after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Whole milk, decelled milk, skimmed milk and whey were analyzed for protein with the Lowry method, modified for fat-containing samples, the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) and the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Cell nitrogen had a tendency to be lower in mature milk than in colostrum. Colostrum contained only 6% casein protein, whereas mature milk contained 13%. Fat from skimming was lower in N than fat from ultracentrifugation. Average NPN levels were similar for milk from all three lactation periods, and constituted 10% of colostrum N and 25% of mature milk N. Protein determined by the Bio-Rad method on whole milk samples had the lowest variability (square root MSE) when correlated to Kjeldahl values. All three assays had lower variability when analyzing whey and skimmed milk than when analyzing whole milk. The Lowry method and the Bio-Rad method had low variability for whey and skimmed milk samples, but the Lowry method yielded analytical values closest to Kjeldahl protein values. The BCA method consistently overestimated Kjeldahl protein by 30%.\r"

Inhibitor levels against cysteine proteinases, such as ficin and cathepsin H, and against serine proteinase such as trypsin were examined. Vitamin E deficiency for 4 mo after weaning induced a fivefold increase in cysteine proteinase inhibitor level in testis, a two- to fourfold increase in prostate and epididymis and no change in seminal vesicle. No appreciable change was observed in trypsin inhibitor level in testis, epididymis or seminal vesicle. Therefore, vitamin E deficiency was reflected most sensitively by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor level in testis. These observations agree with our previous findings that alpha-cysteine proteinase inhibitors in serum increased greatly whereas trypsin inhibitor in serum did not change in vitamin E-deficient rats. Major histological changes were observed in the testes of rats fed a vitamin E-deficient diet for 4 mo, although testis weight was not significantly affected by vitamin E deficiency.\r"

By protein labeling, fractionation and electroblotting, we showed that the supernatant LAI activity was located in the 14-20 kDa region of the gel and was actively secreted upon MNC stimulation. Under negative conditions, the factors with LAI activity were able to constitute larger complexes and their charge was heterogeneous. Their relationship to interleukin-1 (IL-1) is discussed, since the supernatant gave a positive response in the thymocyte proliferation assay; small amounts of IL-1 had the capacity to inhibit PMN adhesiveness and anti-IL-1 blocked this activity.\r"

The gut biopsies of the 7 patients with active joint disease continued to show inflammatory lesions. One of these patients underwent a 3rd ileocolonoscopy after having gone into clinical remission, possibly secondary to treatment with sulfasalazine; the histology was completely normal. The strong relationship between clinical articular inflammation and gut inflammation seems to support the hypothesis that in B27 related diseases, repetitive exogenous triggering causing transgression of oral tolerance by increased gut permeability, provokes and maintains the joint inflammation.\r"

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was diagnosed in 13 patients; the other 19 cases were classified as reactive arthritis with recurrent or persistent pauciarticular synovitis. Twenty-two patients (68%) were HLA-B27 positive; 8 patients (25%) carried the HLA-Bw62 antigen. Ileocolonoscopy was performed 6 months to 32 years after the initial manifestation of the disease (mean : 9 years). Fourteen patients had macroscopic lesions of the ileum and ileocecal valve although only 8 of these had a history of intestinal complaints. Twenty-six patients (81%) presented histological signs of gut inflammation. Most of the gut abnormalities were classified as active chronic or Crohn-like lesions (19/26). Only 7 patients had acute or bacterial enteritis-like lesions. Acute lesions were seen in only one patient with AS. All but 2 patients with sacroiliitis, in whom signs of gut inflammation were found, had active chronic lesions. All the 8 HLA-Bw62 positive patients had histological evidence of gut inflammation. Only chronic or Crohn-like lesions were found. In the majority of patients with JCA with pauciarticular onset, gut inflammation was found on ileum biopsy. Some of their lesions are related to Crohn's disease, and the presence of the HLA-Bw62 antigen could predispose to the arthritis seen in these cases.\r"

The 185 patients all underwent ileocolonoscopy with biopsy of ileum, ileocecal valve and cecum. HLA-B27 was found elevated in the groups with reactive arthritis (48%, chi 2 = 82, p less than 0.0005) and the AS groups (78%, chi 2 = 157, p less than 0.0005), compared to healthy controls. HLA-Bw62 was significantly raised in the patients with reactive arthritis (34%, chi 2 = 73, p less than 0.0005) (particularly the HLA-B27 negatives (48%, chi 2 = 90, p less than 0.0005) and in the HLA-B27 negative patients with AS (25%, chi 2 = 5.5, p less than 0.02).

HLA-Bw62 could be associated with a specific clinical picture of asymmetrical pauciarticular arthritis, accompanied by enthesopathies and sacroiliitis classified as idiopathic reactive arthritis, especially when the disease is of enterogenic origin. The frequency of HLA-Bw62 was very high in patients with reactive arthritis and in patients with AS with active chronic (n = 39, 23%, chi 2 = 13, p less than 0.0005) and Crohn-like lesions (n = 14, 50%, chi 2 = 35, p less than 0.0005) on gut biopsy, normal in patients with acute lesions (n = 35, 11%, NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inflammatory cells in cryostat sections were stained in situ using monoclonal hybridoma antibodies applied in a sensitive avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. In 4 of 8 ligament specimens, focal inflammatory cell infiltrates consisting mainly of T11 + T lymphocytes (77 +/- 9%) and M1 + monocytes (21 +/- 6%) were found. The occurrence of lymphocyte activation markers Ia, 4F2 and T9, 46 +/- 8%, 38 +/- 10% and 14 +/- 5%, respectively, suggests active involvement of the lymphocytes in the local immune inflammation. Our findings suggest a mechanism eventually leading to slackening of the cervical spine ligamentous apparatus and atlantoaxial subluxation in RA.\r"

Conditioned media from PBMC of patients with systemic onset JA (3/3) and 5/7 patients with polyarticular JA increased release of proteoglycan when added to cartilage cultures. Mitogen stimulation of the PBMC was unnecessary for activity and addition of mitogen did not alter proteoglycan release. The PBMC conditioned media from the other patients (2/7) with polyarticular JA, from patients (3/3) with systemic onset JA which had progressed to polyarticular JA, and from patients with pauciarticular JA, did not enhance proteoglycan release without mitogen stimulation. PBMC of normal children produced media which enhanced proteoglycan release after mitogen stimulation.

We examined outcomes among 88 patients (76 men; average age, 59 years) referred for a second opinion as to the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. All patients had undergone coronary arteriography, which disclosed in 63 (72%) multivessel coronary artery disease, while in the remaining 25 patients single-vessel disease involved the left anterior descending coronary artery. Continuation of medical therapy was recommended for 74 (84%) of the 88 patients. Sixty of these 74 patients chose this option and continued to receive medical therapy without any fatalities during a follow-up period of 27.8 months. The remaining 14 patients elected to cross over to surgical therapy at an average of 11.3 months from the second opinion. We conclude that second opinions for selected, motivated patients slated for coronary artery bypass graft operation afford a significant and safe option. Moreover, a majority of patients will adhere to a second opinion recommending medical therapy, thus reducing the need for surgical intervention by as much as 50%. Since the study was based on a small sample size of self-selected patients, these data require caution in extrapolating to the general population with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 mice with Corynebacterium parvum (CP), iv, resulted in a depression of splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity 7-17 days after treatment. This decline in reactivity was accompanied by an increase in splenic tumor-binding cells and a decrease in cytotoxic tumor-binding cells as evaluated in a single-cell assay. Morphologic analysis indicated that the increased tumor-binding cells following CP injection were due to erythroblasts binding to YAC-1 tumor cells. With the use of a double-fluorescent binding technique, nonlytic tumor-binding cells of CP-treated mice inhibited NK cytotoxicity of normal syngeneic mice by competing with effectors for binding to tumor cells. Removal of erythroblasts by hypotonic shock treatment eliminated this competition and significantly improved the lytic capacity of CP-treated mice, thus indicating that erythroblasts contributed to the suppression of NK activity in these mice. The presence of a second inhibitory mechanism in CP-treated mice was found following asialo GM1 treatment or Percoll density gradient separation of erythroblast-depleted CP splenocytes; this inhibitory population was identified as Thy 1.2+ lymphocytes. Further analysis of the mechanism of suppression indicated that it was mediated by a soluble factor. In addition to the presence of suppressor cells, CP-treated mice displayed a decrease in splenic large granular lymphocyte content, which may also contribute to their NK deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Recently much interest has been focused on the role of immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL 1) and interleukin 2 (IL 2) during the pathogenesis of immunological as well as inflammatory diseases. Therefore peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of eight patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) were tested for IL 1 and IL 2 production. Before starting HD, cytokine production by PBMC in culture was not altered in comparison to normal healthy controls, however, a significant increase of IL 1 and IL 2 production was observed within the first HD hour which lasted throughout the end of HD. Moreover direct effects of cellulose membranes on PBMC cytokine production as well as serum IL 1 levels have been investigated. Serum IL 1 levels were already elevated before onset of HD and increased further during HD. The discrepancy between PBMC IL 1 production and serum IL 1 levels may be due to the diminished excretion in patients with end-stage renal disease. Since addition of dialysis membrane particles enhanced monocytes to produce more IL 1 as well as lymphocytes to release more IL 2, a direct stimulatory membrane effect is postulated. The increased release of immunoregulatory cytokines may account for some of the pathologic findings observed during hemodialysis.\r"

Strains of subtype 1c caused proportionately more meningitis and less epiglottis than did strains of subtype 1c. Furthermore, children with disease due to strains of subtype 1c were younger than those with disease due to strains of subtype 1. The significant difference in association between subtype and the diagnosis of epiglottitis or meningitis remained even when the strong influence of age was accounted for. This finding may suggest a true difference in the virulence between these subtypes not previously demonstrated for Haemophilus influenzae type b.\r"

  ".W": "Apache Indian infants have a high frequency of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal infections. Forty percent of Hib infections in these infants occur before the age of six months, when active immunization may not be protective. To evaluate the efficacy of passive immunization with a human hyperimmune globulin (bacterial polysaccharide immune globulin [BPIG]) prepared from the plasma of immunized adult donors, we randomly assigned 703 infants in a double-blind fashion to receive 0.5 ml of BPIG per kilogram of body weight (n = 353) or 0.5 ml of saline (n = 350) intramuscularly at 2, 6, and 10 months of age. Hib-antibody levels were significantly higher in BPIG recipients than in placebo recipients at 4, 6, and 10 months of age (P less than 0.001). During the first 90 days after BPIG or placebo injection, no Hib or pneumococcal infections were detected in the BPIG group, whereas seven Hib infections (six cases of bacteremia and one of meningitis) and four pneumococcal infections (bacteremia) were detected in the placebo group (P = 0.007 and 0.06, respectively). During the fourth month, one case of Hib meningitis and two cases of pneumococcal bacteremia developed in the BPIG group, whereas there were no Hib or pneumococcal infections in the placebo group. We conclude that BPIG given at four-month intervals provided significant protection against serious Hib disease for three months, and that in high-risk infants it might be used alone, perhaps at three-month intervals, or together with active immunization.\r"

This model denies a role for specific antigen selection of B cells and predicts instead a multiclonal population of unmutated or randomly mutated autoantibodies. We have found that the genetic features and clonal composition of spontaneously derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) antiself-IgG (rheumatoid factor (RF] autoantibodies derived from the autoimmune MRL/lpr mouse strain are inconsistent with both the predictions of this model and the actual outcome of experimental polyclonal activation. Instead we have found that MRL/lpr RFs are oligoclonal or even monoclonal in origin. They harbour numerous somatic mutations which are distributed in a way that suggests immunoglobulin-receptor-dependent selection of these mutations. In this sense, the MRL/lpr RFs resemble antibodies elicited by exogenous antigens after secondary immunization. The parallels suggest that, like secondary immune responses, antigen stimulation is important in the generation of MRL/lpr RFs.\r"

TGF-alpha has therefore been regarded as an embryonic growth factor which is inappropriately expressed during neoplasia. Here we report that primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes synthesize TGF-alpha. Furthermore, we show that addition of EGF or TGF-alpha to these cultures induces TGF-alpha gene expression, suggesting that a mechanism of auto-induction exists. Analysis of normal skin biopsies using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrates the in vivo presence of TGF-alpha messenger RNA and protein in the stratified epidermis.\r"

  ".U": "87315340\r", 
  ".W": "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 170,000 with intrinsic ligand-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of EGF to its receptor activates a number of immediate biochemical processes, such as alterations of intracellular free calcium, pH, and increased transcription of several responsive genes, which usually culminate many hours later in DNA replication and cell division. Abolishing the tyrosine kinase activity of three related oncogenes, v-src, v-mos, and v-fps, eliminates their capacity to transform cell. Several reports have suggested that specific aspects of EGF receptor function are independent of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity; however, these studies used an antibody against EGF receptor which failed to activate phosphorylation of exogenous substrates and an insertional mutation in the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase domain which had not been shown to abolish protein kinase activity in cells. Because many transmembrane receptors interact with intrinsic membrane proteins to activate second messenger systems, it is important to resolve experimentally whether mechanisms, in addition to activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, mediate some EGF actions. From functional analyses of an EGF receptor containing a single amino-acid mutation at a site required for phosphate transfer from ATP, we conclude that the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is essential for the diverse biochemical effects of EGF, including rapid alterations in intracellular calcium, activation of gene transcription, receptor down-regulation and the ultimate stimulatory effects on cell proliferation.\r"

In parallel, tests were performed with a pair of previously described peptides, including the homologous region of the glycoprotein (gp) 41 of the HIV strain HTLV-IIIB. In tests with three groups of 20 sera it was shown that the different peptide ELISAs allowed a categorical distinction of antibodies to the two types of HIV. Tests using peptide antigens may provide excellent opportunities for large-scale testing for type-specific antibodies against HIV. The tests are simple, sensitive and specific and are readily standardized.\r"

Studies of peptide antigen binding to detergent-solubilized class II MHC molecules (Ia) have established that peptide-Ia interaction occurs in the absence of the T-cell receptor and varies according to allele-specific features of Ia molecules. The residues of immunogenic peptides thus contribute to two largely independent functions--the control of association with Ia molecules and the determination of the specificity of T-cell receptor binding. Two analogous and potentially independent functional sites have been postulated for Ia molecules--a region that controls binding to peptides and a region that interacts with T-cell receptors. Here we present evidence from functional analysis of recombinant class II molecules that these two postulated functional regions of Ia molecules do exist and can be independently manipulated, consistent with our recent demonstration of the segmental nature of Ia molecule structure-function relationships.\r"
