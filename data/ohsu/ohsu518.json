  ".W": "Alterations in Na, K ATPase pump activity as well as erythrocyte (RBC) intracellular sodium concentration (Nai) have been demonstrated in humans and rats with established hypertension. The contribution of hypertension itself to these changes is unclear. Accordingly, we investigated RBC ion transport and plasma ouabain-like factor (OLF) in four- to five-week old normotensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats on low salt diet. Although both strains were normotensive, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of DS (123 +/- 2 mm Hg) was higher than that of DR (116 +/- 1 mm Hg). No interstrain difference was evident in RBC pump activity measured as ouabain-sensitive 86rubidium (86Rb) uptake (DS = 0.277 +/- .030 and DR = 0.271 +/- .029 mumol/10(9)RBC/h) even though RBC Nai was greater in DS than DR (14.9 +/- 2.0 v 10.7 +/- 1.0 mEq/L; P less than 0.05). Plasma OLF was higher in DS than DR (28.9 +/- 4.7 v 16.5 +/- 2.3 pmol/mL; P less than 0.05), but did not correlate with RBC pump activity in either strain. RBC Nai was directly correlated with pump activity in DS (r = 0.84, P less than 0.01) and demonstrated a trend to correlate in DR (r = 0.71, P = 0.07). RBC Nai was also directly correlated with SBP in DR (r = 0.73, P less than 0.05) and DS (r = 0.70, P = 0.05). We conclude that RBC Nai is genetically determined in Dahl rats and is elevated in normotensive DS who are at risk for hypertension development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes from involved psoriatic plaques (PP), uninvolved, clinically symptomless skin of psoriatic patients (PN) and normal healthy skin (NN) have been cultured in a low calcium serum free system for multiple passages. In this way, the keratinocytes were removed from microenvironmental factors present in the skin. While the basal rate of proliferation of the PP, PN and NN keratinocytes was not different, the PP cells produced more transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) than NN cells, and the antiproliferative response of PP cells to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), a product of activated T lymphocytes, was reduced. We studied IFN-gamma because it can inhibit the proliferation of NN keratinocytes, induce their differentiation and the appearance of two immunoregulatory cell surface molecules, HLA-DR and intercellular adherence molecule-I (ICAM-I), and because in another epithelial cell system, epidermal growth factor (EGF) modulates IFN-gamma activity. The mean antiproliferative effects of IFN-gamma at 50,200, and 500 U/ml for the PP group (n = 10) was less compared to the NN group (n = 11); P less than 0.001, while the PN group (n = 5) had a less dramatic, but statistically significant, reduction in growth inhibition by IFN-gamma only at 200 and 500 U/ml compared to NN cells; P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively. The amount of TGF-alpha produced and secreted by PP keratinocytes from five different individuals was significantly greater than by NN keratinocyte cultures. In addition, IFN-gamma induced TGF-alpha to a lesser extent in PP keratinocytes compared to NN keratinocyte cultures. Keratinocytes isolated from atopic dermatitis and Sezary syndrome patients were similar to NN keratinocytes. In contrast to its differential effects on TGF-alpha production and proliferation, IFN-gamma induced similar amounts of HLA-DR and ICAM-I on PP, PN and NN keratinocytes. Thus, for the PP keratinocytes, there was a dissociation between the antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects of IFN-gamma. These results support our previous hypothesis that the hyperproliferation and altered differentiation of keratinocytes in psoriatic plaques is linked to an altered responsiveness of the keratinocytes to IFN-gamma. Moreover, these results provide an in vitro correlate of our in vivo observation of increased TGF-alpha levels in psoriatic plaques. A new pathophysiological model to understand psoriasis is proposed which integrates these observations involving IFN-gamma and TGF-alpha. This experimental approach also provides a system to dissect biochemical pathways of pathophysiological importance for keratinocyte hyperproliferation in psoriasis.\r"

The values in PIH and pregnancy-aggravated hypertension were significantly higher, although those in chronic hypertension were no different from normal pregnancy. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide showed a clear circadian rhythm with acrophase in the middle of the night, in mild and severe PIH. In the other hypertensive disorders, a circadian rhythm could not be confirmed. The results indicate that the elevated values of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy relate to generalized vasoconstriction, and that the diurnal rhythm is a specific characteristic of PIH.\r"

  ".W": "This is a comparative video-electroencephalographic (EEG) study of typical absence seizures in 4 epileptic syndromes. In 20 patients, 224 absences were recorded and analysed. Significant clinical and EEG differences were found in the seizure patterns of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with absences (JMEA) and myoclonic absence epilepsy (MAE). Clinically, CAE demonstrated more severe impairment of consciousness than JAE while, in JMEA, ictal manifestations were frequently mild and difficult to detect. In the latter, the adolescent patient usually continued his activity, was able to perform even mathematical calculations and often his speech was not disturbed. In children with JMEA, impairment of consciousness was more apparent and sometimes severe. Automatisms occurred in all 4 epileptic syndromes and were proportional to the severity of the demonstrated impairment of consciousness, being rare in JMEA but frequent in CAE and JAE. Expressive speech and overbreathing usually persisted for 1-2 s after the onset of the EEG ictal discharge in CAE. It was less disturbed in JAE where in some absence seizures, interrupted speech and overbreathing were restored during the ictus. A characteristic clinical manifestation of CAE was opening of the eyes in all absence seizures within 1.8 +/- 0.6 s (max. 2.5 s) from the onset of the EEG paroxysms. This early eye-opening behaviour was not observed in JMEA. In MAE, rhythmical myoclonic jerks at 3 Hz make the diagnosis unmistakable. Myoclonic jerks were extremely rare in the absences of JMEA, although all patients had independent myoclonic jerks on awakening. The ictal EEG discharge was longer in JAE (mean 16.3 +/- 7.1 s) than in CAE (12.4 +/- 2.1 s) or JMEA (6.6 +/- 4.2 s). The opening phase of the EEG paroxysms did not show significant differences in CAE, JAE and JMEA but significant changes were found in their initial and terminal ictal phases. In JMEA, the spike-multiple spike-slow wave complexes were not rhythmic and frequently demonstrated variable spike-slow wave relationships. Ictal discharge fragmentations and spike-wave discharges looking like compressed capital Ws were often seen and are characteristic of JMEA. seen and are characteristic of JMEA. Absence seizures demonstrated a more severe impairment of expressive rather than receptive speech, irrespective of differences between syndromes.

In 1987 the risk of infection among infants in that age group was 4 times and among those aged 1 to 4 years 2.5 times that of the general population. The most susceptible appear to be infants about 3 months of age. The annual CFRs had exceeded 50% before the antibiotic era, but with early diagnosis, modern therapy and supportive measures they have been less than 10%. A revised form for reporting cases, currently being considered by provincial epidemiologists across Canada, could help to provide more clinical and epidemiologic information.\r"

Three received 0.05 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) three times a week, three received 0.1 mg/m2 for 4 weeks, and one patient withdrew from study before receiving adequate treatment for evaluation. No significant clinical response was seen. The side effects were fever and chills, and no serious toxicity occurred. Natural killer (NK) and lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) precursor activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined before and during treatment, and expression of HLA-A,B,C molecules was looked for on the tumor cells in the bone marrow of five patients. The NK activity initially low, reached control levels in six patients, but the increase was transient. The LAK precursor activity remained normal.

The two chemotherapy programs, dibromodulcitol, Adriamycin, vincristine, and Halotestin (fluoxymesterone) (DAVH), and thiotepa, Adriamycin, vinblastine, and Halotestin (TAVH), were chosen for comparison on the basis of reported response rates of 40% to 50% with remission durations of 11 months in patients refractory to other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cycles of DAVH were repeated every 4 weeks. Cycles of TAVH were repeated every 3 weeks. Of 184 patients evaluable for response, 32% of patients treated with DAVH and 38% of patients treated with TAVH had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). An additional 5% of patients had nonmeasurable improvement in osseous disease for an overall rate of response (CR + PR + improvement) of 40%. Patients who had previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease or had early failure after adjuvant therapy had a lower response rate to DAVH, but not to TAVH than those who did not fail prior chemotherapy. Duration of response and survival were similar with the two treatments. There were seven treatment-related deaths, five among patients receiving DAVH and two among patients receiving TAVH. Patients receiving DAVH had significantly more thrombocytopenia and neurologic toxicity than those receiving TAVH. These treatments appear to be reasonable second-line regimens and are good candidates to be used in initial therapy of metastatic disease or adjuvant therapy studies that explore the use of alternating non-cross-resistant combinations with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil.\r"

Clinical efficacy was defined in terms of accuracy in staging the tumor based either on surgery, biopsy, or clinical and radiologic follow-up. The CT provided significantly superior accuracy in 27 patients and minor additional staging information in 17 patients compared with the gallium scan. Whole-body gallium scintigraphy provided important additional information in nine patients and minor additional information in a further eight. The diagnostic yield of CT and gallium scanning was considered equivalent in 39 cases. Of the nine cases in which gallium was significantly superior to CT, clinical findings which suggested the presence of metastases had been noted before the scan in four cases. The authors' results confirm the utility of CT for staging lung cancer and indicate that the additional yield from gallium scintigraphy is relatively low provided a thorough history and physical examination have been performed.\r"

Postoperative external-beam (EB) radiotherapy has the advantage of patient selection based upon surgical findings, comprehensive treatment of the pelvic nodal and vaginal cuff areas, and elimination of the need for an intracavitary procedure. Although frequently utilized, this technique is surprisingly poorly described in the medical literature. From 1979 to 1986, 46 surgical Stage I patients received adjuvant postoperative EB therapy at Georgetown University Hospital (GUH) (Washington, DC). Indications for treatment were Grade greater than or equal to 2 and/or depth of myometrial invasion of greater than 33%. The 5-year actuarial survival was 90% with a disease-free survival of 82%. The failure rate within the irradiated field was 6.5% with a distant failure rate of 8.7%. The rate of significant long-term complications was acceptable at 6.5%. The authors conclude that postoperative EB radiotherapy is an effective adjuvant therapy with results comparable to other available radiotherapeutic techniques.\r"

Bioavailability increased from the normal 28% to 65% (p = 0.001) in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Routine liver tests did not correlate with the elimination of flumazenil in individual patients. It can be concluded that elimination of flumazenil is impaired in patients who have stable alcoholic cirrhosis. Despite the relative wide margin of safety of flumazenil, somewhat lower doses could be effective in such patients if long-term oral use is anticipated.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the effect of adding a single bedtime low-dose NPH insulin injection to the previous ineffective sulfonylurea therapy in 23 NIDDM patients with true secondary failure to OHAs. This treatment schedule was conducted for 3 mo by 18 patients (78%) who completed the study. In these patients, the addition of NPH insulin (0.2 +/- 0.01 IU/kg body wt) greatly decreased fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (P less than .001) and glycosylated hemoglobin (P less than .005). No weight gain was observed in any of the patients studied. Five patients dropped out: 2 patients (9%) due to insufficient compliance, 2 patients (9%) due to the multiple insulin injections required to achieve good metabolic control, and 1 patient (4%) due to recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. No correlation was observed between glucagon-stimulated C-peptide values and amelioration of metabolic control. In conclusion, most NIDDM patients with secondary failure to OHAs may be successfully treated with the addition of a single low-dose bedtime NPH insulin injection, and residual beta-cell function evaluation is not able to predict the effectiveness of the combined treatment.\r"

The mechanism of action of antiepileptic drugs is nevertheless inextricably linked to epileptogenesis itself, and investigations of several promising new compounds are underway to establish the levels at which these drugs act. Compounds act on synapses and membranes as well as affecting receptors, neurotransmitters, and peptides. The most extensive data are available on drugs that inhibit the action of GABA or its receptors, including new benzodiazepine-like agents and barbituric-acid derivatives. The few drugs that act by inhibiting the effects of excitatory amino acids are reviewed. Finally, the maximal electroshock test is an empirical method to determine the antiepileptic properties of a drug; several agents under development have been effective in this screening technique.\r"

JME is characterized by myoclonic seizures alone or combined with generalized tonic-clonic seizures or absence seizures. Seizures are precipitated by sudden awakening, sleep deprivation, photic stimulation, and alcohol consumption. The ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a typical 4- to 6-Hz polyspike and wave pattern; the interictal EEG may be normal. Valproate controls seizures in approximately 80% of JME patients and is recommended for successful management of this disorder.\r"

Valproate is the only available antiepileptic drug that has been shown to be effective in controlling the generalized seizure components of JME--myoclonic, tonic--clonic, and absence seizures--without significant side effects. Data were collected using the EpiMonitor software and represented case follow-up from 2 months to 9 years. Forty-three patients (86%) were seizure free for at least 1 year; 25 patients (50%) relapsed at some point during follow-up. Relapses were precipitated most frequently by fatigue, noncompliance, stress, sleep deprivation, and alcohol consumption. With accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy, seizures in JME can be adequately controlled, although JME is a chronic disorder that may require lifelong therapy. To minimize relapse, patient management must also focus on patient lifestyle to eliminate or control lifestyle-associated precipitants of seizure relapse.\r"

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is the first of such epilepsies to be mapped to a chromosome, namely chromosome 6p21.3. Family studies of 68 JME probands from California revealed 50% of all families reported seizures in first- or second-degree relatives. Twelve percent of all family members other than the proband had epileptic seizures. Eighty percent of symptomatic siblings and 6% of asymptomatic siblings had diffuse 4- to 6-Hz multispike-wave complexes. Twelve percent of asymptomatic parents had diffuse, nonspecific slow waves mixed with spikes or sharp waves. JME is tightly linked to the Bf-HLA loci in chromosome 6. No matter what mode of inheritance is assumed, linkage to the clinical manifestations of JME and its associated EEG traits is indicated by lod scores over 3.0, as long as \"EEG affected\" but clinically asymptomatic family members are counted as affected during LIPED analysis. Studies are now being done to further localize the JME site. At the same time, further linkage studies should decide if JME is heterogeneous within itself and whether the same JME site in 6p21.3 underlies absence and grand mal epilepsies.\r"

A statistically significant reduction in uterine and tumor volumes (maximal after 4 months of treatment) was observed in all the patients except one. Two patients discontinued the treatment after 2 months, preferring surgery. A nonsignificant decrease in the mean bone-mineral density was noted after completion of therapy. Minor side effects such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, backache, vaginal spotting, and nervousness, were encountered frequently, disappearing within 6 weeks after the last injection.

The concentrations of follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone (P), and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in the follicular fluids (FF) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). FSH concentration in the FF of the OCs group (15 women, 76 follicles) was significantly lower (2.1 mIU/mL) as compared to the FSH (15.9 mIU/mL) in the FF of the control group (20 women, 60 follicles). The LH FF concentrations after hCG injection were similar in the two groups. The E2/P ratio in the OCs group (9.6) was significantly lower than the E2/P ratio in the control group (20.6).

Pooled analysis of five randomized controlled studies showed a highly significant improvement in mental recovery (p less than 0.001) from high-grade encephalopathy over follow-up times varying from 5 to 14 days. The significance level of the treatment effect did not change when the analysis was repeated using alternative methods of counting and attributing events in these trials. Sharp differences in direction of treatment effect precluded pooling case fatality data. Two studies reported an increased risk of death in the treatment group. Two others showed a clear benefit from administration of parenteral nutrition: the aggregate relative risk reduction was 0.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.80, p = 0.002). Addition of unpublished data from a third positive study increased the relative risk reduction to 0.82 (p less than 0.0001), and the most conservative interpretation of the published data still yielded a significant reduction in mortality (p = 0.023). However, given the uncertainty about effects on mortality and short follow-up times in all studies, a confirmatory randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up periods is warranted.\r"

Rats were treated intragastrically with enprostil (1 or 15 micrograms/kg b.i.d.), BY 831-78 (15 mumol/kg once daily), the combination of enprostil and BY 831-78, ranitidine (300 mumol/kg b.i.d.), and placebo. Plasma gastrin and somatostatin levels and gastric acid secretion were measured during a 1-day treatment in animals fitted with chronic gastric fistulas and repeatedly during 9 wk of treatment in intact rats. Despite inhibiting acid secretion, enprostil did not increase plasma gastrin. When combined with BY 831-78, enprostil transiently reduced the BY 831-78-induced increase of integrated plasma gastrin (1375 +/- 206 vs. 2137 +/- 256 pmol/L.12 h, p less than 0.05) in fasted rats with fistulas, but failed to prevent the marked hypergastrinemia following 9 wk of treatment with BY 831-78 (717 +/- 80 vs. 731 +/- 56 pmol/L) in intact rats. However, enprostil reduced the BY 831-78-induced increase of oxyntic mucosal volume (458 +/- 31 vs. 567 +/- 33 mm3, p less than 0.01), whereas BY 831-78 prevented the enprostil-induced increase of antral mucosal volume (42 +/- 3 vs. 56 +/- 3 mm3, p less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that some of the trophic effects induced by a hydrogen-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor are not exclusively governed by gastrin.\r"

  ".W": "The human colon carcinoma cell line CaCo-2, grown in vitro under standard culture conditions and in the absence of differentiation inducers, spontaneously exhibits structural and functional characteristics of mature small bowel enterocytes. Differentiation is complete at late confluency. High activities of ornithine decarboxylase and diamine oxidase are present in enterocytes. Although these enzymes are involved in polyamine metabolism and therefore in cell replication, their function in small bowel epithelium remains to be defined. In this study ornithine decarboxylase and diamine oxidase activities were assessed in CaCo-2 cells at different stages of proliferation and differentiation. Diamine oxidase was also assayed in spent culture media to assess its spontaneous release by CaCo-2 cells. The trigger effect of medium replacement on ornithine decarboxylase activity was also investigated. Cell growth and cell cycle kinetics were determined by hemocytometric cell count and [3H]thymidine labeling index. Sucrase activity was assayed to evaluate brush-border functional maturation. Elevated ornithine decarboxylase activity was recorded during the replication phase (highest value 0.3 +/- 0.02 U/mg) characterized by high thymidine labeling index (43%), and was greatly enhanced by medium replacement (2.1 +/- 0.3 U/mg). Diamine oxidase activity was low in both cells and medium during the active phase of cell growth, and during the differentiation period it progressively increased (highest value 499 +/- 78 U/mg) along with sucrase activity. The high diamine oxidase activity recorded in the medium (highest value 1292 +/- 310 U/ml) and the evidence of diamine oxidase secretion through the basolateral membrane of the cells cultured on porous filters support the hypothesis of an extracellular role of intestinal diamine oxidase. The CaCo-2 cell line, which shows several analogies with small bowel enterocytes, can be proposed as an interesting in vitro model for studying many aspects of cell replication and differentiation depending on polyamine metabolism.\r"

Eight Tanner stage I adolescents with Crohn's disease, mean age 14 yr 5 mo, had a mean weight gain of 0.38 kg and height gain of 1.4 cm for the year before initiation of nasogastric feedings. All had been either asymptomatic or had only minimal symptoms in the year before the study, but were ingesting only 55%-80% of their daily required caloric intake. The subjects were taught to pass by themselves a nasogastric feeding tube, through which 1000-1500 ml of commercial, nonelemental isocaloric formula was infused during sleep to supplement their usual dietary intake. After 12 mo of nocturnal feedings, the subjects had a mean weight gain of 11.75 kg and a mean height gain of 6.98 cm. Six control subjects, matched for age and degree of growth and sexual retardation at the beginning of the study period, but who had refused the nasogastric feedings, had no change in weight and height during the same period of observation. We conclude that home nocturnal nasogastric feedings can achieve dramatic improvement in weight gain and linear growth in motivated adolescents with Crohn's disease and growth retardation.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis is unknown, but enteral alimentation, infectious agents, and mesenteric ischemia have been frequently invoked as primary initiators of the disease. To define the vulnerability of the intestinal mucosa to ischemia and reperfusion in the developing piglet, we evaluated changes in mucosal permeability using plasma-to-lumen clearance of chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in the ileum of anesthetized 1-day-, 3-day-, 2-wk-, and 1-mo-old piglets as a function of (a) duration of intestinal ischemia (20, 40, or 60 min of total superior mesenteric artery occlusion), (b) feeding status (fasted or nursed), and (c) composition of luminal perfusate (balanced salt solution vs. predigested cow milk-based formula). Baseline chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance was not significantly altered by ischemia, irrespective of duration, or feeding in all age groups. However, clearances were significantly elevated during reperfusion after 1 h of total intestinal ischemia in all age groups, whether fasted or fed. Reperfusion-induced increases in clearance did not differ among age groups when the bowel lumen was perfused with a balanced salt solution. However, luminal perfusion with formula resulted in higher clearances in 1-day-old piglets compared with all older animals. Thus, the neonatal intestine appears to be more vulnerable to mucosal injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in the presence of formula than the intestine of older animals.\r"

  ".W": "The healthy relatives of patients with Crohn's disease were previously found to have increased intestinal permeability to polyethylene glycol 400. To determine whether the abnormal permeability is uniquely detectable by polyethylene glycol 400, we studied the intestinal permeability of three new probes (lactulose, rhamnose, and mannitol) in 25 patients with Crohn's disease, 41 of their healthy relatives, and 29 normal controls without a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with Crohn's disease had increased lactulose permeability when compared with relatives or controls. Lactulose absorption by patients with Crohn's disease was 0.41% +/- 0.07% (mean +/- SE), whereas that of their relatives and unrelated controls was 0.28% +/- 0.03% and 0.26% +/- 0.03%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the relatives and controls, but both groups differed from the patients (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.025, respectively). The patients' lactulose/rhamnose ratio was 70.5% +/- 9.2% vs. 37.2% +/- 3.3% in relatives and 40.6% +/- 5.7% in unrelated controls (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.0025, respectively). The two intermediate-sized probes, rhamnose and mannitol, did not detect permeability differences among the three groups. The inability of lactulose, rhamnose, or mannitol to detect permeability abnormalities in healthy relatives of patients with Crohn's disease suggests that these probes penetrate the intestinal barrier by routes or mechanisms that are different from those of polyethylene glycol 400. Lactulose, in particular, detects permeability changes in patients with intestinal inflammation, and polyethylene glycol 400 is able to detect permeability changes in the health relatives of our patients. These data indicate that permeability may be abnormal as a secondary result of inflammation, or as a result of a primary genetic abnormality.\r"

We measured the absorption of three probes (carbon monoxide, [14C]warfarin, 5.5 mM glucose) from a saline infusate or from saline containing 0.6% guar, which yielded a 20-fold increase in viscosity. Two animal models were used: (a) conscious nonlaparotomized rats with chronically implanted cannulas and (b) anesthetized laparotomized rats. In the anesthetized laparotomized rats, absorption was independent of perfusate viscosity. In the conscious nonlaparotomized rats, the absorption of each of the three probes was significantly greater than in the anesthetized laparotomized rats and increased viscosity caused a 60%-70% decrease in the clearance of the three probes. In anesthetized laparotomized rats, we have shown that fluid moves with laminar flow, and increased infusate viscosity cannot further reduce luminal stirring (or absorption). In conscious, nonlaparotomized rats, laminar flow is disrupted by normal gut motility causing better luminal stirring. Such stirring is inhibited by a viscous infusate resulting in decreased absorption. We conclude that the conflicting results seen in previous studies can be attributed to the model used. In conscious animals where luminal stirring was good, a viscous infusate caused decreased absorption.\r"

Rats were injected with either recombinant human interferon alpha A, recombinant human interferon gamma, recombinant rat interferon gamma, or vehicle and experiments were performed 24 h later. In some animals theophylline elimination was determined twice (10 days apart), once after interferon and once after vehicle. Theophylline clearance was also determined in the isolated perfused rat liver after pretreatment of animals with interferon or vehicle. Pretreatment of animals with rat interferon gamma significantly reduced theophylline clearance in the intact rat but neither human interferon alpha A nor human interferon gamma altered theophylline elimination in vivo. Similar results were observed in the isolated perfused rat liver. We then examined whether the effects of interferon on hepatic drug metabolism were generalized or confined to individual cytochrome P450 isozymes; androstenedione hydroxylation pathways were used as catalytic probes for individual cytochrome P450 isozymes. Rat interferon gamma (but not human interferon alpha A) decreased levels of total hepatic microsomal P450 and reduced androstenedione 16 beta-hydroxylation. The formation of three other hydroxylated androstenedione metabolites appeared reduced to a similar extent, although these changes were not significant. It is concluded that autologous but not heterologous interferons impair oxidative drug metabolism in the rat. The reduction of hepatic P450 produced by interferon may result from the suppression of multiple isozymes.\r"

Water contaminated with fecal matter was the apparent source of infection. Disease-associated virus-like particles were detected by immune electron microscopy in the feces of three patients within 5 days of illness. The virus-like particles were agglutinated by autologous acute-phase serum but not by convalescent serum. Rhesus monkeys inoculated with particle-containing fecal suspensions developed biochemical and morphologic features of acute, self-limited hepatitis. The findings in the present study and in earlier investigations of sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis suggest that (i) the epidemic form and a proportion of sporadic cases of this infection in India may be related, both being enterically transmitted and associated with infection by a 27- to 32-nm virus-like particle, (ii) antibody responses to this virus occur early in disease and are transient and (iii) the rhesus monkey may prove to be a suitable model for studies of epidemic non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

This hormone interacts with other organ systems in multiple and complex ways. Studies are in progress to elucidate further its physiologic importance, mechanism of action, and pathophysiologic significance in the development of certain cardiovascular and renal diseases, as well as other conditions with sodium and water imbalance. Also of great importance is its potential pharmacologic application in the treatment of these same diseases.\r"

We report 10 cardiac transplant recipients in whom acute rejection was dramatically reversed and clinical symptoms resolved after treatment with OKT3. Side effects were minimal, including febrile episodes, innocuous diarrheal syndromes, mild opportunistic infections, and one hypotensive episode. Critical care nurses administering OKT3 must be cognizant of the risks and benefits of therapy in addition to recognizing potential drug side effects. A nursing care plan was devised to identify nursing diagnoses and intervention related to patient and family education as well as recognition and treatment of the reported adverse effects.\r"

The prosthesis was prepared by extruding type-I collagen into fibers and crosslinking it either with glutaraldehyde or with dehydrothermal treatment followed by exposure to carbodiimide. A tendon prosthesis was assembled by coating a longitudinal array of the fibers with uncrosslinked collagen. In one leg of the rabbit, the Achilles tendon was replaced with the synthetic tendon; in the contralateral leg of the animal, the tendon was excised, devascularized, and anastomosed as an autogenous graft. The autogenous tendon grafts were seen to be infiltrated centrally by fibroblasts and capillaries ten weeks postoperatively and to have been partially replaced by repair tissue twenty weeks postoperatively. Three weeks after implantation, all collagen implants were noted to have been infiltrated with fibrous tissue. At ten weeks, reorganization of collagenous tissue was observed in and around the prostheses, and the carbodiimide-crosslinked implants had been resorbed and replaced by normal-appearing neotendon. The implants that had been treated with glutaraldehyde were resorbed more slowly and were surrounded by more inflammatory cells, compared with the prostheses that had been treated with carbodiimide. Neotendon in the glutaraldehyde-treated prostheses matured more slowly. When the implants were examined at intervals after the operation, their mechanical properties approached those of fresh tendon. The initial strength of the carbodiimide-treated implants was lower than that of the fresh autogenous grafts. Twenty weeks after implantation, the strength and modulus of the carbodiimide-treated implants approached those of fresh tendon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cells were prelabelled with 51Cr and cell injury was measured by release of 51Cr, cell detachment, and by electron microscopy. The injury was also studied after a rewarming period of 35 minutes in cell culture medium at 37 degrees C. Endothelial cells incubated with cell culture medium, but otherwise treated in a similar way, served as controls. Both cardioplegic solutions caused significantly greater release of 51Cr than cell culture medium when incubated at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C. The Bretschneider's solution induced slightly more release of 51Cr than did the St. Thomas' solution. The cells did not become detached during incubation. Electron microscopy of the cells after 5 hours with the cardioplegic solutions at 10 degrees C revealed contraction of the cells, mild intracellular oedema, swelling of mitochondria, and blebs or craters on the luminal surface of the cells. After rewarming in culture medium for 35 min the cells were not contracted and showed only minimal signs of injury, indicating a rapid and nearly complete reversibility of the changes. The present observations indicate that cultured endothelial cells get some protection, albeit not optimal, from the two crystalloid cardioplegic solutions tested. The presence of procaine-CL increased the injurious effect of the solutions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulates estradiol (E2) synthesis in human granulosa and granulosa luteal cells. Cells from individual follicles from spontaneous and human menopausal gonadotropin/CG-stimulated cycles were cultured in serum-free medium containing androstenedione, IGF-I, FSH, and/or CG. At 2, 4, and 6 days, E2 in the medium was measured by RIA. In the granulosa experiments, control cells produced basal levels of E2 at 2 days, and the levels increased with increasing follicle size. Treatment with FSH stimulated E2 production (on the average, 5-fold), and the effect was dose dependent (ED50 = 5 ng/mL or 16 mIU/mL). Incubation with IGF-I alone caused increases in E2 production comparable to those caused by FSH, and the IGF-I effect was dose dependent (ED50 = 8 ng/mL). In most cases, coincubation with FSH and IGF-I augmented E2 levels more than either hormone alone, and at 4 and 6 days the interaction was synergistic. The data from dose-response experiments suggested that the basis of the synergy between FSH and IGF-I was a marked potentiation by either hormone (approximately 10-fold) in the potency of the complementary hormone to stimulate E2 production. In the experiments with granulosa luteal cells from spontaneous and in vitro fertilization preovulatory follicles, the controls synthesized very high levels of E2 spontaneously at 2 days; however, E2 production declined 700% at 4 days, and no E2 was produced by control cells at 6 days. Treatment with FSH, CG, or IGF-I did not cause a significant increase in the high basal levels of E2 at 2 days. During subsequent culture, however, all three hormones stimulated E2 production at 4 and 6 days, but the increases were modest and not sustained. In contrast, coincubation of granulosa luteal cells with FSH plus IGF-I or CG plus IGF-I dramatically enhanced E2 production at 4 and 6 days (on the average, 4-fold), and the effects were sustained throughout the culture period.

As expected the fetal atria express the hANP gene at a high level, accruing substantial quantities of ANP immunoreactivity and ANP mRNA. The neonatal ventricle also expresses the hANP gene at a significant level. ANP mRNA levels in the ventricle were, on the average, about 20% of those in the right atria. ANP immunoreactivity in ventricle was less that 5% of that in the right atria, suggesting important differences in the way these tissues synthesize and store the ANP peptide. Much lower levels of hANP transcripts were also detected in the lung and aortic arch. Analysis of the 5' termini of cardiac hANP transcripts using three independent techniques suggests the presence of two transcription start sites. A major start site is located approximately 28 basepairs downstream from the primary TATA sequence. A second minor start site is positioned about 110 basepairs further upstream. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis indicate that the hANP gene is expressed in a homogeneous distribution throughout the atrial myocardium. Diffuse low level expression is also present within the ventricular myocardium. In addition, there are scattered foci of increased expression in the ventricle which tend to be concentrated in the subendocardium of that organ. These findings indicate that the developing human ventricles as well as the atria possess the capacity to express the hANP gene at a substantial level and suggest that the ventricle may contribute significantly to the circulating pool of plasma ANP.\r"

To investigate further the mechanism of the regulation of human muscle glycogen synthase by insulin, we measured the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase before and after a 200-min hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in Southwest American Indians. Insulin infusion resulted in a decreased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity assayed at physiological cAMP concentration with increased glycogen synthase activity in all subjects (n = 5; P less than 0.01). No significant change was observed in cAMP-independent protein kinase activity. These results suggest that 200 min of insulin administration during a euglycemic clamp may regulate human muscle glycogen synthase activity by mechanisms other than the stimulation of phosphatase; one probable mechanism is by decreasing the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\r"

  ".W": "The recurrent deficiency of progesterone (P) secretion by the corpus luteum has been associated with infertility and habitual abortion and given the clinical diagnosis of luteal phase deficiency (LPD). There is evidence that both follicular and luteal phase abnormalities can result in LPD cycles. In this study we have examined reproductive hormone levels and preovulatory follicular size in women with LPD (n = 10). For the purposes of this study, LPD was determined by an endometrial biopsy in the studied cycle that was more than 2 days out of phase. These biopsies were performed in women with infertility or habitual abortion who exhibited an out of phase biopsy in a prior cycle. The control group consisted of 28 normal women. Daily serum levels of the following hormones were determined in each subject: LH and FSH [immuno- and bioactive (LH-immuno and LH-bio)], P, estradiol (E2), and inhibin. The LPD women exhibited significant decreases in integrated luteal phase levels of inhibin [10,615 +/- 898 vs. 13,560 +/- 662 (U/L).days; P less than 0.02] and E2 [5,015 +/- 275 vs. 6,435 +/- 393 (pmol/L).days (1366 vs. 1753 (pg/mL).days); P less than 0.05] in addition to the expected decrease in P [280 +/- 23 vs. 420 +/- 23 (nmol/L).days (88 vs. 132 (ng/mL).days); P less than 0.01]. On days 6-11 after the LH surge (day 0), there was a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in mean LH-bio levels in LPD compared with those in normal women (146 +/- 26 vs. 212 +/- 24 micrograms/L). The midcycle LH surge was deficient in LPD when both LH-immuno [482 +/- 30 vs. 672 +/- 43 (micrograms/L).days; P less than 0.01] and LH-bio [1711 +/- 179 vs. 2248 +/- 226 (micrograms/L).days; P less than 0.05] levels were compared with normal values. When comparing the follicular phase in LPD with that in normal women, similar follicle size, peak and integrated E2 levels, and mean LH and FSH (immuno and bio) levels were found. The only follicular phase abnormality noted in this study was decreased mean levels of serum inhibin in the early and midfollicular phases (221 +/- 19 vs. 308 +/- 25 U/L; P less than 0.01). In this group of women with LPD, low levels of inhibin in the follicular phase were consistent with the concept of a defect in function of the preovulatory follicle, possibly as a result of previously described defects in gonadotropin secretion in this condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) is a reproductive disorder associated with infertility and spontaneous abortion. This study was undertaken to determine whether LPD might be related to an abnormal pattern of gonadotropin secretion. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the pattern of pulsatile LH secretion in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in normal women (n = 21) and women with LPD (n = 20), which was diagnosed on the basis of two out of phase endometrial biopsies. In addition, we sought to determine whether changes in progesterone (P) pulse patterns could account for the decrease in average serum P levels in women with LPD. To this end, we examined the pulse patterns of P and compared these patterns between normal women and those with LPD. Frequent blood sampling was performed in both groups to determine their respective hormone secretion patterns. In the follicular phase, blood samples were obtained every 10 min for 12 h; in the luteal phase the samples were obtained every 10 min for 12 h; in the luteal LH, FSH, and P were assayed in each sample. Pulse detection was performed by an adaptive threshold method of pulse analysis. The LH pulse frequency was significantly higher in the women with LPD than in the normal women in the early follicular phase [P less than 0.05; LPD, 12.8 +/- 1.4 (+/- SE); normal, 8.2 +/- 0.7 pulses/12 h]. LH pulse frequency was similar in the early and late follicular phases in the women with LPD, whereas it was higher in the late follicular phase in normal women. Mean serum FSH levels were not different between groups in both the early and late follicular phases. In the luteal phase the P pulse amplitude and mean serum P level were significantly lower in the LPD group than in the normal women (P less than 0.01). We conclude that 1) a too rapid LH pulse pattern in the early follicular phase may lead to inadequate LH support of the corpus luteum and become manifest as LPD; 2) the mechanism for inadequate P secretion in LPD is decreased P pulse amplitude; 3) the finding of similar serum FSH levels in the two groups in both the early and late follicular phases did not support compromised folliculogenesis as an etiological factor for LPD.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile GnRH administration for induction of ovulation is often ineffective in polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) patients. To clarify and correct the endocrine mechanisms underlying this deranged response we gave pulsatile GnRH (5 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) patients with primary amenorrhea for 19 cycles and to PCOD patients for 24 cycles before (pre-A) and for 25 cycles after (post-A) GnRH analog suppression. Compared to IHH, pre-A cycles were characterized by elevated LH, estradiol, and testosterone; reduced luteal phase progesterone; and low ovulatory (38%) and pregnancy rates (8%). Conversely, LH, estradiol, and follicular phase testosterone levels were lower in post-A than in pre-A cycles, while luteal phase progesterone was higher; the endocrine pattern of post-A cycles closely resembled the one of IHH cycles. The ovulatory and pregnancy rates of PCOD patients improved remarkably in post-A cycles (90% and 38%, respectively). Excessive body weight was associated with a lower incidence of ovulation in both pre-A (15%) and post-A cycles (75%). A worse endocrine pattern and a lower ovulatory rate (50%) were obtained when a second consecutive post-A cycle occurred without repeating GnRH analog suppression. No signs of even mild ovarian hyperstimulation and no multiple pregnancies were recorded in the post-A cycles. We conclude that in PCOD 1) deranged pituitary sensitivity, excessive ovarian androgen secretion, and obesity critically affect folliculogenesis and ovulation; 2) pituitary-gonadal suppression with a GnRH analog markedly improves the endocrine and clinical responses to pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction; 3) optimal results can be achieved only when each pulsatile GnRH cycle is preceded by GnRH analog suppression; and 4) pulsatile GnRH is highly effective and safe for ovulation induction, provided that PCOD subjects are pretreated with a GnRH analog.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the role of frequency of atrial contraction compared to acute increases in right atrial pressure in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release in humans. The studies were performed in patients undergoing electrophysiological study. In group 1 (n = 12) the rate of atrial contraction was increased by continuous rapid right atrial pacing at a rate of 120 beats/min (bpm; group 1A; n = 6) or 176 bpm (group lb; n = 6) for 5 min. No increases in atrial pressure or circulating ANP occurred in response to atrial tachycardia. In contrast, continuous rapid right ventricular pacing (group II: n = 12) at ventricular rates of 120 bpm (group IIa; n = 6) and 150 bpm (group IIb; n = 6) increased both right atrial pressure and circulating ANP. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to studies in vitro, increases in the frequency of atrial contraction in the absence of increases in atrial pressure do not release atrial natriuretic peptide. These studies, therefore, support the conclusion that atrial pressure is the primary physiological stimulus for ANP.\r"

After morning sc administration of 50 or 100 micrograms octreotide or placebo, plasma GH, TSH and GHRH were measured frequently for 6 h. Plasma GH or IR-GHRH concentrations did not change after placebo injection, but plasma TSH levels gradually decreased, in conformity with a circadian rhythm during the morning. The mean plasma GH levels after sc injection of 50 or 100 micrograms octreotide declined, and no spontaneous GH pulses occurred for 5 h. Plasma TSH decreased rapidly after both doses of octreotide and was significantly lower than the level after placebo treatment from 90-315 min (P less than 0.05) and 60-360 min (P less than 0.05 or P less than 0.01), respectively. Plasma IR-GHRH levels also were significantly lower from 30-360 min (P less than 0.05) in the group given 100 micrograms octreotide compared with the value in the placebo group. We conclude that octreotide inhibits not only GH and TSH secretion from the pituitary, but also GHRH release from the hypothalamus and/or peripheral tissues. These findings suggest that somatostatin controls GH secretion not only by suppressing pituitary secretion of GH but also by suppressing GHRH release from the hypothalamus.\r"

To verify whether a priming regimen might be able to reverse the reduced GH response to GHRH, elderly subjects underwent repetitive administration of hpGHRH-40 and placebo in a double blind design (100 micrograms hpGHRH-40 or volume-matched saline iv as a single morning dose, every 2 days for 12 days). After the hpGHRH-40-priming regimen, plasma GH values 30, 60, and 90 min after the acute GHRH test were significantly higher than values at the corresponding time points after placebo treatment. These findings suggest that somatotroph cells become less sensitive to GHRH with normal aging and demonstrate that repetitive administration of GHRH restores the attenuated response.\r"

To assess the differential effect of these antihistamines on reaction times and subjective symptoms, we compared terfenadine, 60 mg twice daily, to hydroxyzine, 25 mg twice daily, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 16 healthy, asymptomatic adults. Simple reaction time and choice reaction time were measured with a computer-based, eye-hand, reaction-time testing apparatus. Reaction times and symptom scores were assessed 90 minutes after the fourth and tenth doses of each drug. Hydroxyzine, but not terfenadine, significantly prolonged both simple and choice reaction time (p less than or equal to 0.0001). However, decision time, the time to process one bit of spatial information, was not prolonged by either antihistamine. Therefore, hydroxyzine prolonged the interpretation and response to stimuli of the central nervous system without increasing single-bit processing time. Although terfenadine was not different from placebo for any symptom assessed, hydroxyzine produced significant drowsiness (p = 0.001), dry mouth (p = 0.022), and irritability (p = 0.021). During the 5 days of hydroxyzine administration, neither objective nor subjective symptoms demonstrated the development of tolerance. No correlation was found between subjective symptoms and prolongation of reaction times by hydroxyzine, suggesting that side effect symptoms of traditional antihistamines are unreliable predictors of objective performance. Terfenadine provides a promising therapeutic alternative to traditional antihistamines for individuals performing critical tasks.\r"

The dependent variable was latency of the P3-evoked potential. The P3 is a cognitively evoked electroencephalographic response that is an objective and sensitive measure of sustained attention and cerebral processing speed. Disease and drug states that adversely affect the central nervous system can slow P3 latency. For example, the centrally active anticholinergic scopolamine slows cognitive processing speed and prolongs P3 latency. P3 latency (millisecond) means (+/- mean standard error) were pretreatment, 310 (+/- 1.7; placebo, 313 (+/- 3); terfenadine, 320 (+/- 3); and chlorpheniramine, 333 (+/- 3).

Also, no difference in response to AMP and saline was found between atopic and nonatopic subjects. We further investigated, in seven atopic subjects, whether the skin wheal-and-flare response to the single, highest dose of AMP, saline, and histamine could be inhibited by preadministration of 180 mg of terfenadine, a potent H1 antagonist. A significant inhibition of the wheal-and-flare response to histamine and no significant inhibition to AMP were found. There was a significant inhibition of the flare response caused by hypertonic saline but no inhibition of the wheal response. We interpret these findings as indicating that AMP does not specifically lead to mast cell degranulation in the skin and that there are functional differences between cutaneous and lung mast cells. The observation that terfenadine significantly inhibited the flare response to hypertonic saline suggests that this stimulus produced histamine release.\r"

  ".U": "89381302\r", 
  ".W": "The exposure of experimental animals to the inflammatory effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known to cause depressions in their ability to initiate and effectuate various types of cellular immune responses. Contact-type and delayed-type hypersensitivity, plus the ability to generate protective forms of anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity, are all affected by the prior exposure of normal animals to the effects of this physical agent. Presently, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) responsible for mediating the changes in immune function observed in UVR-exposed animals is not fully understood. Herein we report that one reproducible consequence of exposing normal mice to low doses of UVR is a dramatic change in the pattern of lymphokines secreted by their activated T cells. Lymphocytes isolated from UVR-exposed donors produce/secrete greatly reduced levels of the T cell lymphokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma activation in vitro with protein Ag of the polyclonal T cell stimulant anti-CD3. The secretion of IL-4 by these lymphocyte cultures, however, is consistently elevated in comparison to normal controls. Further studies determined that a similar change in lymphokine production was induced when mice were treated with either bacterial LPS or rIL-1 beta, a cytokine known to be elevated in vivo after UVR or LPS exposure. The ability of IL-1 to facilitate a change in the capacity of T lymphocytes to produce/secrete lymphokines after in vitro activation does not appear to represent a direct effect of this cytokine on lymphocyte or accessory cell targets because addition of IL-1 beta to cultures of Ag-primed lymphocytes obtained from normal donors was incapable of altering the pattern of lymphokine production. Collectively, our present results add further support to the hypothesis that UVR-induced elevations in endogenous IL-1 are, in part, responsible for the immunomodulatory effects of UVR. These findings provide compelling evidence that UVR, plus other agents capable of endogenously stimulating the production of IL-1, may function to alter the expression of different effector mechanisms in vivo. This could be facilitated through selective reductions in lymphokines produced by Th-1-type cells (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and a simultaneous augmentation in a lymphokine produced by Th-2-type cells (IL-4).\r"

  ".W": "Calcium ionophore, A23187, is known to be a comitogen, but it activates a suicide process characterized by DNA fragmentation at linker regions in mouse immature thymocytes. It did not induce DNA fragmentation in T lymphocytes prepared from lymph node and spleen cells. Induction of DNA fragmentation by A23187 depends on protein phosphorylation and synthesis of mRNA and protein, because an inhibitor of protein kinase, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), actinomycin D, and cycloheximide, respectively, inhibits the DNA fragmentation and cell death. Studies adding the inhibitors at various times show that protein phosphorylation and mRNA synthesis occur within a few hours after incubation with A23187 followed by the protein synthesis responsible for inducing DNA fragmentation. Phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PBD), which are capable of activating protein kinase C, also induced similar DNA fragmentation in immature thymocytes, followed by cell death. PBD committed the suicide process after 6 h of incubation, because the DNA fragmentation above the control level was not induced when PDB was removed from the medium before 6 h of incubation. A23187 or a phorbol ester alone induced DNA fragmentation followed by cell death, whereas the addition of TPA at low concentration inhibited the DNA fragmentation induced by A23187 accompanied with an increase in DNA synthesis. The result suggests that TPA switched a suicide process induced by A23187 to an opposite process: stimulation of DNA synthesis. Physiologic factors and mechanisms which regulate cell proliferation and death in the thymus are not known at present, but the signals by protein kinases and calcium ions may regulate both cell proliferation and death, independently, synergistically or antagonistically.\r"

  ".W": "The studies described show that functional Mls specific tolerance, which we previously reported in peripheral spleen cells of mice injected within 24 h of birth with Mls incompatible spleen cells, is observable in the thymus on day 6. At this time a significant positive response is not detectable in spleen cells of normal mice. In the limiting dilution assay, we are able to detect a more profound depletion than others have found with anti-TCR antibodies. The tolerance in the thymus is not due to active suppression or simple dilution of responders by nonresponsive cells of the neonatal inoculum. By tolerizing BALB/c (Mls(b,c] mice with spleen cells from Mls(a) congenic mice, we show that Mls(a) incompatibility alone is sufficient for tolerance induction. Data from these experiments also show that the T cells seen responding at high frequency to stimulators from mice expressing Mls(a) determinants, as well as many other non-H-2 encoded incompatibilities, are indeed responding to Mls(a) determinants. In addition, experiments involving neonatal injection of Mls(b) mice with Mls(a) and Mls(c) spleen cells show no cross-reactivity of tolerance between Mls(a) and Mls(c) haplotypes. Our findings also show coexpression of determinants common to both Mls(a) and Mls(c) haplotypes by the Mls(d) haplotype. In all, the described experiments elucidate a pattern of Mls determinant specific hyporesponsiveness, in mice neonatally injected with appropriate allogeneic spleen cells, which bears all the hallmarks of functional, alloantigen specific, clonal deletion type tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "An Ag-specific, IL-2-dependent Th clone induced the growth of B cells in a class II-restricted, Ag-specific, IL-2-dependent manner. The formation of stable Th-3.1-B cell conjugates was restricted by Ag and class II MHC. After activation of Th-3.1 by insolubilized anti-T3 (Th-3.1T3), Th-3.1T3 induced the growth of B cells in a class II unrestricted, Ag nonspecific manner. The formation of stable conjugates between Th-3.1T3 and B cells was also class II unrestricted and Ag nonspecific. Although the interaction of Th-3.1T3 and B cells was class II unrestricted, the interaction was inhibited by the combination of anti-IA and anti-IE mAb. This suggested that monomorphic domains of class II MHC molecules were involved in Th-3.1T3-B cell interaction. Fixed Th-3.1T3 but not fixed resting Th-3.1 induced B cell cycle entry, as measured by an increase in B cell RNA synthesis. Trypsin-treatment of Th-3.1T3 before fixation reduced their ability to activate B cells, indicating that cell surface proteins on Th-3.1T3 were required for enhanced B cell RNA synthesis. Anti-IL-4, anti-IL-2R, or anti-IFN-gamma did not affect the ability of Th-3.1T3 to induce heightened B cell RNA synthesis. Progression into S phase by B cells activated with fixed Th-3.1T3 was supported by the addition of soluble factors. When stimulated with fixed Th-3.1T3, EL4 supernatant (SN) enhanced B cell DNA synthesis. Depletion of IL-4, but not IL-2, from EL4 SN ablated its supportive capabilities. IL-4 alone was completely ineffective in supporting entry into S phase. Therefore, IL-4 and another activity(ies) in EL4 SN were necessary for B cell cycle progression into S phase. Taken together, these data suggest that after Th activation, Th cell surface proteins are expressed that mediate the binding of Th to B cells via recognition of nonpolymorphic domains of class II MHC molecules. Contact of Th-3.1T3 with B cells, not lymphokines, results in the entry of B cells into the cell cycle and heightened B cell lymphokine responsiveness. The addition of exogenous lymphokines supports the progression of Th-3.1T3-activated B cells into S phase.\r"

The PBMC source of BFU-E was prepared either to retain or deplete APC by treatment with appropriate mAb and C. BFU-E grown in cocultures were counted at day 14 and replicate cultures assayed for IFN-gamma production on days 1 to 7. Analysis of MLR cells indicated that large, rapidly cycling cells recovered from MLR at day 6 have significant NK activity, whereas CTL activity is minimal, and production of IFN-gamma requires reexposure to APC. The smaller, noncycling cells recovered from MLR at day 12 have comparable NK activity, also require reexposure to APC for IFN-gamma production, but in addition have significant CTL activity. The addition of day 12 MLR cells to BFU-E cultures results in MHC restricted inhibition of BFU-E growth, suggesting that the CTL activity and not the NK activity contained within this population of cells is responsible for BFU-E inhibition. Studies using enriched population of BFU-E indicated that appropriate APC are needed to trigger both IFN-gamma production and BFU-E inhibition by the PTC. By using various APC-BFU-E combinations it was determined that after reexposure of PTC to appropriate APC, the inhibition of BFU-E was still target-specific indicating a direct effect between the PTC and BFU-E.\r"

The CD3 components gamma and epsilon and the CD8 alpha subunit were phosphorylated after activation of the CTL clone with the protein kinase C activator PMA. Class I MHC molecules were phosphorylated irrespective of PMA activation. Constitutive phosphorylation of the MHC class I products was found to be intrinsic to the transmembrane/cytoplasmic portion of the molecules because it was transferred to the CD8 alpha hybrid molecules composed of extracellular CD8 and MHC class I transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains (CD8-e/MHC-t-i). Measurements of the dynamics of these cell surface molecules by using radiolabeled mAb revealed distinct behaviors: TCR/CD3 complex ligand internalization was increased (around 50% after 40 to 60 min) after PMA activation, whereas the ligand of class I MHC molecules was internalized at constant rate irrespective of PMA activation. Ligand bound to native CD8 molecules was poorly internalized, irrespective of the activation of the T cells with PMA. The same ligand bound to the CD8-e/MHC-t-i hybrid molecule was internalized at the same rate as a class I MHC molecule ligand, indicating that the behavior of the hybrid molecule was characteristic of the transmembrane/cytoplasmic portion of MHC class I molecules.\r"

Monocytes were obtained from the peripheral blood of normal volunteers by discontinuous gradient centrifugation and adherence to tissue culture plastic. Platelets were obtained from the platelet-rich plasma of the same donor. When 10(9) platelets and 2.5 x 10(6) monocytes were co-stimulated with 1 microM A23187, these preparations released greater quantities of 12(S)-hydroxy-10-trans-5,8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid, 5(S),12-(S)dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene C4, 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic (LTC4) when compared with monocytes alone. Release of arachidonic acid, 5-HETE, delta 6-trans-LTB4, and delta 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 from monocytes was decreased in the presence of platelets. A dose-response curve was constructed and revealed that the above changes became evident when the platelet number exceeded 10(7). Dual radiolabeling experiments with 3H- and 14C-arachidonic acid revealed that monocytes provided arachidonic acid, 5-HETE, and LTA4 for further metabolism by the platelet. Monocytes did not metabolize platelet intermediates detectably. In addition, as much as 1.2 microM 12(S)-hydroxy-10-trans-5,8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-10-trans-5,8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid had no effect on monocyte lipoxygenase metabolism. Platelets were capable of converting LTA4 to LTC4, but conversion of LTA4 to LTB4 was not detected. We conclude that the monocyte and platelet lipoxygenase pathways undergo a transcellular lipoxygenase interaction that differs from the interaction of the neutrophil and platelet lipoxygenase pathways. In this interaction monocytes provide intermediate substrates for further metabolic conversion by platelets in an unidirectional manner.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we reported that a derivative of wheat germ agglutinin (termed WGA-D) specifically inhibits human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis to FMLP by blocking reexpression (or recycling) of formyl peptide receptors. WGA-D (? formyl peptide receptor probe) binds to a protein on the PMN membrane that exhibits the same m.w. as the formyl peptide receptor. Since clustering (i.e., capping) of ligand-receptor complexes most likely precedes their internalization, we examined the ability of normal and stimulated PMN to cap fluoresceinated WGA-D. We found that, in contrast to capping of fluoresceinated Con A, PMN cap WGA-D in a chemotactic factor-specific fashion. Fluoresceinated WGA-D (5.0 to 20 micrograms/ml) alone did not induce either PMN shape changes (i.e., activation) or capping. Both FMLP (1 to 1000 nM) and human C5a (0.1 to 1.0 nM) induced PMN to polarize and to cap bound WGA-D, in a concentration-dependent fashion. Interestingly, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (5.0 nM), while inducing the same degree of PMN polarization as FMLP (100 nM) and C5a (0.5 nM), failed to induce PMN to cap bound WGA-D. In contrast, FMLP (100 nM), C5a (0.5 nM), and LTB4 (5.0 nM) induced PMN to cap bound fluoresceinated Con A (10 micrograms/ml) to the same extent. The effect of suboptimal concentrations of FMLP and C5a on capping of WGA-D by PMN was additive. LTB4 did not enhance either FMLP or C5a-induced capping of WGA-D by PMN. Also, FMLP and C5a (but not LTB4) were capable of inducing both desensitization and cross-desensitization of WGA-D capping by PMN. Studies using rhodamine-labeled WGA-D and a fluoresceinated analog of FMLP revealed that both capped to the same place on the PMN membrane. Thus, the data suggest that WGA-D binds to a site on the PMN membrane that is either the FMLP receptor or very closely associated with it.\r"

Combinations of IL-1 and TNF-alpha when added simultaneously to HMC resulted in a dose-dependent synergistic increase in PGE2 production. These stimulatory effects were specifically inhibited by anticytokine antibodies and the synergistic effect required the simultaneous presence of both IL-1 and TNF-alpha. Arachidonic acid (AA) release experiments and measurement of cyclooxygenase activity, revealed that while both were increased by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha alone (IL-1 beta greater than TNF-alpha), combinations of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha resulted in only additive increases in AA release and cyclooxygenase activity. Taken together, these data suggest that stimulation of PGE2 in HMC, by combinations of these cytokines, is not rate limited by AA release or cyclooxygenase activation, but may be related to the induction of the distal enzymes controlling specific PG synthesis.\r"

The culture supernatants contained significant levels of IL-1 which were consistently higher than those in the cell cultures stimulated with an optimal concentration of LPS. This finding extends to a macrophage cell line, P388D1, and peritoneal exudate cells stimulated with starch in vivo. However, the level of IL-1 produced was significantly reduced when the cells were preincubated with a lymphokine preparation (supernatant of Con A-stimulated rat spleen cells). The level of IL-1 produced seems to be directly correlated with the degree of parasitization of the macrophages. A similar and dose-dependent reduction in IL-1 production by infected macrophages could also be obtained when the cells were preincubated with IFN-gamma. This finding is in direct contrast to that of visceral leishmaniasis in which peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania donovani not only fail to produce IL-1 but also lose the capacity to produce IL-1. This apparent discrepancy is discussed in terms of a possible difference in the induction of cell-mediated immunity between the two leishmanial diseases.\r"

Significant lymphoproliferative responses were observed when T cells from immunized mice were challenged in culture with purified 18-kDa protein. Synthetic peptides have been prepared that span most of the 148 amino acid residues that constitute the sequence of the 18-kDa protein and used to map epitopes recognized by T cells. When mice were immunized with 18-kDa protein and lymph node cells subsequently prepared and challenged in microculture proliferative assays by using synthetic peptides, only one region of the intact protein appeared stimulatory. This T cell epitope was located between residues 116 and 121, adjacent to an epitope between residues 110 and 115 which we have previously shown to bind the L5 mAb. Immunization of mice with peptides, and subsequent challenge of lymph node cells in assays by using the 18-kDa protein as Ag revealed that residues 111-125 were the most effective in priming responses. Furthermore, the ability of 18-kDa primed lymph node cells to recognize determinants on both M. leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis indicates that in addition to possessing an M. leprae-specific B cell determinant, the 18-kDa protein contains a cross-reactive T cell epitope(s).\r"

The ability of spleen cells from infected mice to produce endogenous IFN-gamma and release H2O2 during the course of malaria was also studied. In BALB/cByJ mice, which are relatively susceptible to PyL and PyNL, there was an initial burst of IFN-gamma only in response to PyNL whereas in CBA/J mice, which are relatively resistant to these parasites, there was an initial burst of IFN-gamma in response to both PyL and PyNL. The kinetics of H2O2 release corresponded to that of IFN-gamma. In all infections, levels of IFN-gamma declined as parasitemia increased; however, nonlethal infections were characterized by a recovery of both IFN-gamma activity and H2O2 release as parasitemia declined. These data suggest that IFN-gamma may play an important role in modulating the course of malaria infections by activating macrophages for both intracellular and extracellular parasite destruction.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of endogenous IFN-gamma for prevention of toxoplasmic encephalitis was studied in mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma gondii by using a mAb to this lymphokine. Control mice chronically infected with the ME49 strain that received saline or normal IgG had slight inflammation in their brains whereas those that received the mAb developed severe encephalitis. In contrast to control mice, the mAb-treated mice had many areas of acute focal inflammation and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells in the meninges and parenchyma of their brains. In the areas of acute focal inflammation, tachyzoites and Toxoplasma Ag were demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining with the use of rabbit anti-Toxoplasma antibody, suggesting that the focal inflammation was induced by Toxoplasma organisms. Acute inflammation was also observed around cysts of Toxoplasma. Immunohistologic staining revealed tachyzoites and Toxoplasma Ag surrounding the periphery of these cysts suggesting cyst disruption had occurred. Mice treated with mAb against IFN-gamma had five times the numbers of cysts in their brains as did control mice. These results clearly indicate that endogenous IFN-gamma plays a significant and important role in prevention of encephalitis in mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma. The mAb-treated mice had the same Toxoplasma antibody titers and the same degree of macrophage killing of Toxoplasma as did untreated controls. These results suggest that IFN-gamma may have a direct role in preventing cyst rupture and toxoplasmic encephalitis.\r"

  ".W": "The association of the class II genes of the DRw10 haplotype from a cell line, NASC, initiated from a member of a well characterized family, was analyzed by sequencing cDNA clones corresponding to DR beta I, DQ alpha, and DQ beta genes. An identical haplotype was also identified in the Raji cell line. In addition to typing as DRw10 and DQw1 with HLA typing sera both, the NASC and Raji cell lines were shown to react strongly with the monoclonal antibodies 109d6 (specific for DRw10 beta 1 and DRw53 beta 2 gene products) and Genox 3.5.3 (specific for DQw1) and exhibited the restriction fragment length polymorphism indicative of a DRw10, DQw1 haplotype. The DR beta 1 gene corresponding to the DRw10 specificity was found to have a first domain sequence different from all other DR beta I genes. Sequence analysis of the 3'-untranslated region of this DR beta-chain gene showed a significant divergence from the 3' untranslated region of the DRw53 family of haplotypes and a lesser divergence from that of the DRw52 and DR1/DR2 families. The sequence of the DQ beta genes corresponding to the DQw1 specificity in the DRw10 haplotype was found to be identical to the DQ beta gene from a DR1, DQw1 haplotype. Surprisingly, however, the DQ alpha gene did not resemble other DQw1-like DQ alpha genes, but was identical in sequence to the DQ alpha gene found in DR4 haplotypes. The novel association of DQ alpha and DQ beta genes in the DRw10 haplotype revealed in these studies may result from a double recombinational event. More consequentially, these studies strongly suggest that the DQw1 specificity recognized by Genox 3.5.3 is determined by the DQ beta chain and is not affected by the DQ alpha-chain.\r"

The finding was extended to hybridomas prepared from nonimmune transgenic mice, many of which also failed to exhibit allelic exclusion. The proportions of mu a and mu b secreted by individual hybridomas varied markedly, and the product of an individual hybridoma was found to be heterogeneous with respect to the allotype content of individual molecules. The ratio of mu a:mu b chains secreted by individual hybridomas was found to correlate with the number of transgene copies remaining in each hybridoma, and several hybridomas that secrete only mu b-positive molecules had apparently lost all but one copy of the transgene. An idiotype characteristic of the transgene was found to be present only in association with the transgenic (mu a) allotype, and indirect evidence strongly suggests that the idiotype was present only on mu a polypeptide chains. Thus, there is no evidence in this system for the induction of idiotypically cross-reactive endogenous molecules.\r"

In this report we have directly determined the role of the thymus in the induction of HGG tolerance and the proliferative responsiveness of T cells from normal and HGG-tolerant mice. Draining lymph node T cells were isolated from HGG-tolerized and -challenged mice, and tested for their proliferative response to HGG in vitro. T cells from untreated but challenged adult CBA/CaJ and A/J mice proliferate in response to HGG, whereas such mice given monomeric HGG before challenge fail to show an HGG-specific proliferative response. APC from tolerant or nontolerant mice were equally effective in the support of Ag-specific proliferation of primed T cells. The influence of the thymus gland on HGG-induced T cell unresponsiveness was assessed by determining whether thymectomized mice could be tolerized to HGG. The results suggest that the generation of T cell tolerance to HGG is independent of thymic function as assayed by both antibody production in vivo and T cell proliferation in vitro. Unresponsiveness of T cells from tolerant mice was not a result of the presence of CD8+ cells since removal of CD8+ cells from lymph node T cells did not alter unresponsiveness to HGG in vitro. Further, mixing tolerant T cells with normal HGG-primed T lymphocytes did not inhibit proliferation of the HGG-primed cells. The results of this investigation suggest that this mouse model of tolerance to HGG represents a thymus-independent unresponsiveness of mature peripheral T cells to a nonself-Ag. Understanding the regulation of tolerance to HGG may give additional insight into the mechanisms required for the maintenance and possibly the induction of tolerance to certain self-Ag in peripheral lymphoid organs.\r"

  ".U": "89381356\r", 
  ".W": "The lytic activity of most CD8+ MHC class I allospecific CTL generated in vitro can be inhibited by anti-CD8 antibodies. Such inhibition has led to hypotheses that CD8/class I interactions normally contribute to the triggering of CTL with low or moderate avidity Ag-specific TCR by providing those CTL with auxiliary binding avidity. However, CD8 has also been proposed to play an active signaling role in T cell activation. We have recently reported that multivalent cross-linking of CD8 on CTL precursors in MLC does appear to mediate activation signals, and induces the generation of CD8+ MHC class I allospecific CTL whose lytic activity cannot be blocked by anti-CD8 antibodies. In our present study, we have further characterized such anti-CD8 uninhibitable effector cells. These CTL are resistant to blocking of their lytic function by anti-Lyt-3 mAb as well as anti-Lyt-2 mAb, but remain sensitive to blocking by anti-LFA-1 mAb, indicating that they do use non-CD8 cell adhesion molecules during target cell recognition and lysis. As a consequence of mAb-induced multivalent CD8 cross-linking during their generation, anti-CD8 uninhibitable CTL significantly reduce their cell surface expression of CD8, which permits their identification and facilitates their purification from heterogeneous MLC populations. Such anti-CD8 uninhibitable effector cells can be maintained as stable CTL lines, in the absence of anti-CD8 mAb after the initial induction period. The in vitro generation of anti-CD8 uninhibitable CTL, which may be highly enriched for cells bearing high affinity TCR, could represent a new experimental approach to studies of TCR gene usage and repertoire, as well as a potentially important strategy for the deliberate generation of high affinity effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Previous data generated by ourselves and others questioned the role of degranulation as a mechanism to explain CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. In this report we examine this tissue in greater depth. CTL-mediated lysis was probed with three different inhibitors. 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene inhibits degranulation in a wide range of cell types, including CTL. EGTA, through chelation of Ca2+, also inhibits degranulation processes in CTL, and would inhibit other events or processes dependent on extracellular Ca2+. We also used prolonged exposure to PMA to exhaust PKC activity in CTL. Using these inhibitors, we have defined three pathways of lysis used by CTL. One pathway requires Ca2+, is PMA sensitive, but does not depend on degranulation. The second pathway is independent of Ca2+, is not PMA sensitive, and also does not depend on degranulation. All primary CTL and cloned CTL lyse most target cells via pathway I. However, when confronted with certain target cells (which we have referred to previously as Ca2+-independent target cells), pathway II is induced. When pathway II is induced, pathway I apparently shuts down. We show here that pathway II does not depend on protein synthesis, and that it also leads to DNA solubilization in target cells. A limited number of cloned CTL use pathways I and II as just described, but use in addition, and simultaneously, a third pathway that appears to involve degranulation. This pathway is seen irregularly in most CTL clones, and may be influenced by levels of IL-2 in the culture medium.\r"

  ".U": "89381358\r", 
  ".W": "Previously, we demonstrated that two signals were required for accessory cells to induce B cell unresponsiveness: tolerogenic Ig and PG. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PGE2, in an accessory cellfree system, promoted fluorescein-specific B cell unresponsiveness in conjunction with ligands which bound to surface Ig (sIg) and/or FcR. Several conditions were found whereby PGE2 was obligatory for unresponsiveness. In the presence of aggregated, but not monomeric non-Ig fluorescein-Ag, direct plaque-forming cell responses were reduced by 60%. In contrast, engagement of the B cell FcR by aggregated IgG2b or by the 2.4G2 anti-FcR mAb failed to induce unresponsiveness, even when PGE2 was present. These data suggested that PGE2 could promote sIg-mediated negative signaling. A second condition where PGE2 promoted unresponsiveness occurred when sIg and FcR were simultaneously engaged by monomeric ligands. However, when sIg and FcR were cross-linked, PGE2-independent B cell unresponsiveness occurred. Interestingly, when subinhibitory doses of cross-linking agents were used, PGE2 dependent negative signaling resulted. PGE2 can thereby promote B cell unresponsiveness in three different situations. First, when sIg is extensively cross-linked by aggregated antigens or those with repeating determinants. Second, when sIg is engaged by monomeric antigen and when the B cell FcR is also occupied. Third, under conditions where B cell sIg and FcR are inadequately cross-linked. These situations can occur in vivo when macrophages in the B cell microenvironment (i.e., follicles) secrete PGE2 and when Ag with repeating epitopes, or immune complexes capable of binding B cell sIg and FcR are present. Thus, PGE2 can serve as an important regulatory element in limiting antibody formation.\r"

  ".W": "The murine B cell FcR for IgG (Fc gamma RII) is a membrane glycoprotein reported to mediate inhibition of B cell activation and differentiation. We show that IL-4 inhibits the enhanced expression of Fc gamma RII by LPS-stimulated B cells. This activity is completely reversed by anti-IL-4 mAb and is specific, in that multiple other lymphokines tested do not exert a similar effect. This effect of IL-4 is apparent by day 1 of culture, although maximal inhibition occurs on day 4 at a concentration of 500 U/ml. The IL-4-induced inhibition of enhanced Fc gamma RII expression by LPS stimulation observed on day 4 of culture is associated with a significant reduction in the steady state level of Fc gamma RII beta gene-specific mRNA. IFN-gamma which inhibits many of the effects of IL-4 on B cells, does not reverse the IL-4-induced inhibition of Fc gamma RII membrane expression nor the levels of beta gene-specific mRNA. Fc gamma RII expression is significantly increased in B cells stimulated with antigen-specific, CD4+ T cell clones of the Th1 type (i.e., IL-2 and IFN-gamma-producing). By contrast, three different Th2 clones (i.e., IL-4-producing) fail to stimulate an increase in Fc gamma RII levels. Anti-IL-4 mAb significantly enhanced Fc gamma RII expression by Th2-stimulated B cells indicating that IL-4 was the active, inhibitory, substance produced by the Th2 cells. Supernatants from stimulated Th2 clones inhibited the enhanced expression of Fc gamma RII by LPS-stimulated B cells and this activity was completely reversed by anti-IL-4 mAb. By contrast, supernatants from stimulated Th1 clones further enhanced Fc gamma RII expression by LPS-stimulated B cells. The differential regulation of B cell Fc gamma RII expression by Th subsets may play an important role in the regulation of humoral immunity by altering the sensitivity of B cells to IgG immune complex-mediated inhibition of B cell activation and differentiation in vivo.\r"

We found that primary (unprimed) CD4+ T cells mediated the rejection of pancreatic islet grafts, whereas, primary CD8+ T cells failed to do so, even though both T cell subpopulations were competent to reject skin allografts. These data indicate that primary CD4+ T cells are necessary for rejection of allogeneic pancreatic islet grafts, whereas primary CD8+ T lymphocytes are not. Implications concerning the nature of the APC involved in the initiation of the rejection response to islet allografts and the expression of MHC Ag by pancreatic islet cells are discussed.\r"

The addition of PMA (1 x 10(-9) to 8 x 10(-8) M) to 3-wk-old cultures of blood-derived monocytes induces cell fusion with a 30% to 80% fusion rate. Moreover, IFN-gamma-treated blood-derived monocyte cultures showed an additional enhancement of fusion rate with the addition of PMA. 1(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, a protein kinase inhibitor, inhibited the formation of macrophage-derived giant cells when added before phorbol ester and IFN-gamma. These findings suggest that protein kinase C may play an important role in the formation of macrophage-derived MGC.\r"

Our findings demonstrate that IL-2, alone and in serum-free conditions, can trigger and regulate TNF receptor expression on normal lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the receptor was rapidly induced on CD4, CD8, and CD16+ cells after IL-2 stimulation. Receptors increased with culture duration, became maximal between days 5 and 9, and were maintained for 18 to 20 days in the presence of IL-2. By using 125I-TNF and FITC-TNF binding, we present evidence that IL-2 concentration determines the magnitude of lymphoid TNF receptor expression--influencing both the percentage of TNF-positive cells within the population and the number of receptors/cell. Collectively, our results are persuasive for consideration of IL-2 as a central mediator in the regulation of lymphocyte TNF receptors.\r"

Lysis in the total hemolytic C assay by C2D sera was Ca2+-dependent and required a high concentration of hemolysin to sensitize E. Selective component depletion indicated a requirement for C1 and C4 of the classical pathway (CP) and proteins B, P, and probably D of the alternative pathway (AP). Total hemolytic C could be restored to normal in these C2D sera by utilizing heavily sensitized E or by the addition of a supranormal concentration of B. This system most closely resembles a pathway described by J. E. May and M. M. Frank which requires antibody, C1, and the AP but not C4 or C2. It differs in its requirement for C4. We hypothesize that this pathway represents vestiges of a more primitive C pathway. It becomes evident and possibly clinically important in the setting of C2 deficiency, by allowing C activation, other than the AP, and perhaps in normal individuals, by damaging microorganisms that have evolved means to inhibit early components of the CP.\r"

  ".W": "The addition of drugs which inhibit the lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism to 5 day cultures of mitogen-stimulated human B cells enhanced the proliferative response more than 10-fold. Several chemically dissimilar lipoxygenase inhibitors increased proliferation in this system, whereas the specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect. A lipoxygenase inhibitor could be added as late as 48 to 72 h after the initiation of culture and still cause a significant increase in B cell proliferation. These drugs increased the proliferation of both peripheral blood B cells and tonsillar B cells activated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I or anti-Ig M antibodies, in combination with a crude T cell supernate, a commercial B cell growth factor preparation, or recombinant lymphotoxin. A similar effect was observed in tonsillar B cells purified by counterflow centrifugal elutriation to remove esterase positive accessory cells, suggesting this is a direct effect on the B cell. Lipoxygenase blockade also caused a greater than twofold increase in polyclonal Ig production. The enhanced proliferation caused by lipoxygenase blockade could not be reversed by adding back exogenous leukotrienes or hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids to the cultures. Furthermore, B cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid did not produce radiolabeled lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid under the same culture conditions in which the addition of lipoxygenase inhibitors had a profound effect on proliferation. Thus, lipoxygenase inhibitors markedly stimulate B cell proliferation under a variety of experimental conditions, although the mechanism responsible for this action has not yet been elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The recombinant cytokines IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and granulocyte (G)-CSF are all known to affect the function of neutrophils. We have investigated their ability to alter the surface expression of neutrophil Fc gamma R and CR. FcRI, formerly considered to be mononuclear phagocyte specific, was found on a variable percentage of neutrophils after 12 h of tissue culture. These levels could be readily enhanced by IFN-gamma at 0.5 U/ml suggesting that neutrophil FcRI is extremely sensitive IFN-gamma. In addition, membrane expression of FcRIII, the most abundant receptor of neutrophils, could also be increased by IFN-gamma and by GM-CSF and G-CSF. However, the opposite effect was observed in samples in which the initial levels of FcRIII were high. In these situations IFN-gamma and GM-CSF caused a decrease in receptor expression. No consistent alterations were found in the levels of FcRII. Cytokine-induced increases in both FcRI and FcRIII were not evident within the first hour of treatment suggesting that these molecules are not available in an intracellular compartment but must be newly synthesized. In contrast, the CR, CR1 and CR3, could be rapidly induced by GM-CSF indicating that this cytokine causes the mobilization of preformed molecules to the membrane. G-CSF and IFN-gamma did not alter the expression of CR1 and CR3. Thus, the very different effects of IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and G-CSF suggest that the neutrophil functional profile will be distinctively affected by exposure to each of these cytokines.\r"

  ".U": "89381385\r", 
  ".W": "Human peripheral blood-derived eosinophils were assessed for their viability, density, and functional properties after 7 days of culture with purified mouse IL-5 and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Whereas none of the eosinophils remained viable after 7 days of culture in the absence of IL-5, 38 +/- 12% and 61 +/- 14% (n = 6, mean +/- SD) of the eosinophils survived in the presence of 1 pM IL-5 alone or 1 pM IL-5 in the presence of 3T3 fibroblasts, respectively (p less than 0.05). Direct contact between the fibroblasts and the eosinophils was not needed for this enhanced IL-5-dependent viability. After 7 days, 66 +/- 7% (n = 6) of the cocultured eosinophils were viable when the two cell types were separated by a 0.4-microns filter. As assessed by density-gradient centrifugation after 7 days of IL-5 exposure, all of the original normodense eosinophils became hypodense. The time course of this conversion was accelerated by the presence of 3T3 fibroblasts. Enhanced helminthic cytotoxicity was maintained by the 7-day cultured eosinophils only if they had been cocultured with fibroblasts. Eosinophils killed 10 +/- 11% (n = 5), 48 +/- 17%, and 31 +/- 15% of the larvae when they were cultured for 7 days in IL-5 alone, in IL-5 in direct contact with 3T3 fibroblasts, or in IL-5 with filter separation of the fibroblasts and the eosinophils, respectively. The ability of IL-5 to induce progenitor cells to differentiate selectively into eosinophils, and of 3T3 fibroblasts to facilitate the IL-5-mediated conversion of normodense eosinophils to hypodense eosinophils with increased viability and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity suggests a role for both hematopoietic and tissue factors in determining the presence and pathobiologic function of activated hypodense eosinophils in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions.\r"

Two of these, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil protein X (EPX), are reported to have similar m.w. and both possess neurotoxic and helminthotoxic activities. Therefore, the properties of these molecules were analyzed to determine whether they differ. EDN was purified from eosinophils of patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome and EPX from the buffy coat cells of normal individuals. By SDS-PAGE, both proteins showed a major band at 18.7 kDa and a minor band at 21.4 kDa. By two-dimensional non-equilibrium gel electrophoresis the proteins migrated identically. With radiolabeled proteins in reverse phase HPLC, both proteins eluted at the same concentration of acetonitrile and showed identical tryptic maps. Both proteins possessed comparable ribonuclease activity and both were comparably neurotoxic in the rabbit. By immunodiffusion the two proteins showed a reaction of identity; by RIA, with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, the proteins had very similar inhibitory activities. These results indicate that EDN and EPX have virtually identical properties and are probably the same protein.\r"

  ".W": "A delayed-type hypersensitivity response has been postulated as the effector mechanism of lung-phase immunity to Schistosoma mansoni. We have sought evidence for this response by examining the state of alveolar macrophage activation in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with radiation-attenuated cercariae, and challenged with normal parasites. As an index of activation, the capacity of macrophages to produce an oxidative burst upon stimulation with PMA, was measured at the single cell level by a flow cytometric method. Fourteen to 28 days after vaccination with 20-kr parasites, highly activated macrophages were recovered from the airways by bronchoalveolar lavage. Their probable role in resistance is to recruit T lymphocytes and macrophages to \"arm\" the lungs against subsequent challenge. The level of macrophage activation had declined to near background by the time challenge parasites arrived, although pulmonary leucocyte numbers remained elevated. Activated alveolar macrophages were not detected after vaccination with 80-kr parasites, which fail to reach the lungs or induce resistance. Challenge parasites, arriving in the lungs of 20-kr vaccinated mice, stimulated a rapid increase in the activation state of recruited macrophages, coincident with their retention in the pulmonary vasculature. These events occurred later in challenge control mice, with peak activation at day 21, when migration of parasites to the liver is complete. Mice vaccinated with 80-kr parasites lacked the accelerated response to challenge, behaving like the control group. The absence of activated peritoneal macrophages suggests a response restricted to organs such as the lungs, through which both vaccinating and challenge parasites migrate. We suggest that the role of activated alveolar macrophages in lung-phase immunity is to initiate and maintain the focal inflammatory responses which block onward migration of parasites and lead to their demise.\r"

Southern blot analysis, molecular cloning, and mapping revealed that the rearrangements are related to one another and are not due to normal VJ joining. Sequence analysis indicated that the rearrangement was due to the integration of the transposon like element ETn upstream of V lambda 2. Because a normal embryonic V lambda 2 is still retained in this cell line one of the rearranged fragments must be due to a secondary event after the aneuploidization of the plasmacytoma. RNA dot blot analysis showed that the transposon is strongly expressed not only in embryonic cells but also in plasmacytomas, B lymphomas and T cell lines.\r"

The transgenic animals had no biologic or developmental defects as human IFN-gamma does not bind to the mouse IFN R. Regulation of the transgene paralleled that of the endogenous murine IFN-gamma gene in that: 1) it is not expressed constitutively in any tissue examined thus far, 2) it can be induced in thymus and spleen cells by T cell mitogens, 3) it is not expressed in B cells stimulated by LPS, and 4) it produces normal mRNA and biologically active IFN protein. Whereas expression of the transgene is likely restricted to T cells, we had observed that both fibroblasts and B cell lines could express the same DNA when transfected in vitro; this indicates that in vivo, developmental factors restrict expression of the IFN-gamma gene to T cells. These findings also indicate that the 8.6-kb fragment contains the regulatory elements necessary for normal tissue specific expression in vivo. Moreover, they indicate that the regulatory elements for this gene are completely preserved over the phylogenetic distance separating mouse and man, even though substantial drift has occurred in the structural gene, and probably in the IFN-gamma R as well.\r"

  ".U": "89381400\r", 
  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that IL-2 promotes the adhesion of NK cells to endothelial cells (EC) and that EC are readily lysed by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in vitro, suggesting that cell mediated endothelial injury may contribute to the capillary leak syndrome observed in patients treated with IL-2. In this investigation, we sought to determine the effects of EC activation on the in vitro susceptibility of EC to LAK cell-mediated cytolysis. Despite increased binding of CD16+ lymphocytes to TNF-activated EC monolayers, prior exposure of EC to any of several IL-2-inducible cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IFN-gamma not only failed to render the EC more vulnerable to cytolysis but increased their resistance to LAK cells in 111Indium release cytolysis assays. This decrement in susceptibility to cytolysis resulting from prior exposure to cytokines preceded any detectable increase in HLA class I or II Ag expression. In cold target competition experiments with LAK cell effectors and radiolabeled K562 target cells, TNF-primed EC were no more competitive than unstimulated EC, and in assays with unstimulated PBMC effectors, the addition of unlabeled TNF-activated EC actually increased the cytolysis of the radiolabeled tumor cells. The effects of various cytokines and lymphocyte preparations on EC permeability were also evaluated. In these experiments, saphenous vein EC were cultured on porous filter disks, exposed to cytokines or lymphocytes, and the diffusion of 125I-BSA through the filters was then measured. Exposure to IL-2, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha did not increase the diffusion of the BSA through the EC-coated filters, whereas LAK cells markedly increased their permeability. Consistent with the results of the cytolysis assays, pretreatment of the EC with TNF, IL-1, or IFN-gamma diminished the LAK cell-induced increase in BSA diffusion. These results suggest that although circulating IL-2-inducible cytokines such as TNF and IFN-gamma may activate EC in vivo and contribute to lymphocyte margination and lymphopenia, they may not be directly responsible for the IL-2-induced capillary leak syndrome and may actually protect EC from LAK cell-mediated injury.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are cell surface adhesion molecules important in many lymphocyte-mediated responses. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can induce ICAM-1 expression by keratinocytes, and that lymphocytes adhere to IFN-gamma treated keratinocytes. In view of the importance of keratinocyte/lymphocyte interactions in the pathogenesis of cutaneous disease, we have examined the effects of in vivo IFN-gamma on cutaneous expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1. Fourteen volunteers received intradermal IFN-gamma (dose: 1 or 10 micrograms) daily for 3 d. Biopsy was obtained on day 6. Cryostat sections were stained by the peroxidase antiperoxidase technique employing murine monoclonal antibodies to CD11, CD18, and ICAM-1. IFN-gamma intensified ICAM-1 expression by dermal endothelial cells and induced keratinocyte expression of ICAM-1. Furthermore, after administration of 10 micrograms of IFN-gamma LFA-1 positive (LFA + ve) lymphocytes were observed along the basement membrane zone closely related to ICAM-1 + ve basal keratinocytes and also surrounding dermal endothelium. Exposure to IFN-gamma induced expression of both CD11a and CD18 antigens on epidermal Langerhans cells. These studies suggest that the distribution of adherence molecules expression within cutaneous tissue in vivo is modulated by IFN-gamma, and that these alterations may be important in interactions involving cutaneous immunocompetent cells.\r"

Three kinds of films were compared: polyvinylidine chloride, a low gas permeability film; polyurethane, a medium gas permeability film; and poly(dimethyl silicone), a high gas permeability film. Exudate under the silicone film had the highest P O2 and the lowest P CO2; exudate under the polyurethane had intermediate P O2 and P CO2; and exudate under the polyvinylidine chloride had the lowest P O2 and highest P CO2. Values for pH under the films correlated inversely with P CO2. The gas tensions and pH are a reflection of the ability of the films to control the diffusion of oxygen into and the loss of carbon dioxide from the wound exudate. Mean epithelialization values at 2 and 3 d were not significantly different under polyvinylidine chloride and polyurethane, but both were higher than under the silicone film. We infer from the data that the use of oxygen and carbon dioxide impermeable film dressings do not affect epithelialization in well-perfused, shallow wounds. The use of the silicone film (highly permeable to both oxygen and carbon dioxide) led to a loss of carbon dioxide. The resulting relatively high pH may have been responsible for the reduced rate of epithelialization which occurred beneath the silicone film.\r"

This association led directly in the same institution to carefully designed experimental studies undertaken in the rat, and a non-human primate, the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) with a heart and lipid metabolism more closely resembling that of man. In both animal species, a vegetable fat diet had a protective effect against the increase in contractility of isolated papillary muscles induced by age, the addition of animal fat, or by isoprenaline in vitro. Similar effects were observed following coronary artery ligation, where the extent of dysrhythmia was greatly reduced by supplementing the diet with a linoleic acid rich vegetable oil. It is concluded that the combination of epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates a protective effect of dietary polyunsaturates against sudden cardiac death. This work illustrates the value of the integration of epidemiological and experimental approaches to the aetiology of disease.\r"

The expected gains in QALYs were found to be quite small, ranging from 2.3-11.4 months in males, and 1.4-7.6 months in females. Previous attempts to estimate the nature and magnitude of the benefits of antihypertensive therapy have all been based on extrapolations from epidemiological data, instead of on the actual achieved reductions in mortality and morbidity demonstrated in clinical trials.

We have tested this potential synergism in vivo by administration of both cytokines to patients with advanced cancer using overlapping 24-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusions in a phase I trial. Thirty-six patients were treated with a fixed dose of interferon-gamma (200 micrograms/m2/d) with interpatient dose escalation of TNF (from 5 to 205 micrograms/m2/d). The dose-limiting toxicity at the maximal-tolerated dose (MTD) of TNF (205 micrograms/m2) with interferon-gamma was hypotension. Other toxicities noted included an influenza-like syndrome, transient decreases in circulating leukocyte and platelet counts, subclinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the sporadic occurrence of acute pulmonary toxicity. The recommended phase II dose for this combination schedule is TNF, 136 micrograms/m2, with interferon-gamma, 200 micrograms/m2. The addition of interferon-gamma to TNF resulted in a greater than three-fold increase in toxicity compared with TNF administered as a single agent, supporting the hypothesis that the combination of these cytokines may induce synergistic effects in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of zinc chelators on 65Zn uptake, absorption and tissue distribution were determined in rats using ligated duodenal loops. 65Zn was supplied as Zn-methionine complex, ZnCl2, ZnCl2 + L-methionine or ZnCl2 + EDTA. The effect of EDTA was also determined in the presence of phytic acid. Absorption of 65Zn was markedly reduced in rats given Zn-methionine complex or ZnCl2 + EDTA. The 65Zn level in tissues (liver, bone, muscle, skin, kidney, and thymus) of rats given ZnCl2 + EDTA was also significantly reduced compared to that of rats given ZnCl2. Reduced absorption due to phytic acid was not improved by EDTA, although EDTA increased mucosal 65Zn retention. High performance gel filtration chromatography showed six 65Zn-binding peaks in the mucosal cytosol of rats given ZnCl2. A seventh peak attributable to Zn-EDTA was observed in cytosol from rats given ZnCl2 + EDTA. A comparable peak in plasma was not observed. Both EDTA and Zn-methionine complex reduced 65Zn-binding to a low-molecular-weight component of mucosal cytosol that was not metallothionein. The results suggest that Zn-EDTA is transported intact from the lumen into mucosal cells but not across the basolateral membrane. The adverse effects of EDTA and Zn-methionine complex on zinc absorption were associated with reduced 65Zn-binding to a component of mucosal cytosol that may be involved in zinc absorption.\r"

  ".W": "The present study aimed at comparing the effects of pinacidil, a putative K+ channel opener, and diazoxide on ionic and secretory events in rat pancreatic islets. Pinacidil and diazoxide provoked a dose-dependent increase in 86Rb outflow from pancreatic islets perifused in the presence of glucose. Both drugs inhibited the glucose- and tolbutamide-induced increase in 45Ca outflow and insulin release whereas failing to affect the ionic and secretory responses to K+ depolarization. Pinacidil and diazoxide, in contrast to quinine, failed to affect 86Rb outflow from pancreatic islets stimulated by the Ca++-ionophore A23187. Pinacidil as well as diazoxide abolished the glucose-induced increase in [Ca++]i but did not modify the rise in [Ca++]i provoked by KCl. Lastly, both drugs were shown to stimulate an ouabain-resistant modality of 86Rb inflow into the islet cells. The close similarities between the ionic and secretory events mediated by pinacidil and diazoxide suggest that pinacidil could interfere with the same target site as diazoxide; namely the beta-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel.\r"

  ".U": "89382259\r", 
  ".W": "Incubation of rat liver microsomes with [3H]methoxsalen and NADPH resulted in the covalent binding of a methoxsalen intermediate to proteins comigrating with cytochromes P-450 UT-A, PB-B/D, ISF-G and PCN-E. Binding was increased by pretreatments with phenobarbital, beta-naphthoflavone (beta NF) and dexamethasone. Such pretreatments also increased the loss of CO-binding capacity either after administration of methoxsalen, or after incubation of hepatic microsomes with methoxsalen and NADPH. Immunoprecipitation of the methoxsalen metabolite-protein adducts in phenobarbital-induced microsomes was moderate with anti-UT-A antibodies, but marked with anti-PB-B/D and anti-PCN-E antibodies. Immunoprecipitation was observed also with anti-ISF-G (anti-beta NF-B) antibodies in beta NF-induced microsomes. Methoxsalen (0.25 mM) inhibited markedly the benzphetamine demethylase activity of phenobarbital-induced microsomes and the erythromycin demethylase activity of dexamethasone-induced microsomes. Whereas methoxsalen itself did not produce any binding spectrum, in contrast either in vivo administration of methoxsalen or incubation in vitro with methoxsalen and NADPH resulted in a low-to-high spin conversion of cytochrome P-450 as suggested by the appearance of a spectrum analogous to a type I binding spectrum. This low-to-high spin conversion was apparently due to a methoxsalen intermediate (probably, covalently bound to the protein and preventing partial sixth ligation of the iron). We conclude that suicide inactivation of cytochrome P-450 by methoxsalen is related to the covalent binding of a methoxsalen intermediate to the protein moiety of several cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes (including UT-A, PB-B/D, PCN-E as well as ISF-G and/or beta NF-B).\r"

  ".W": "Amygdala-kindled rats were treated with valproic acid (VPA; administered as its sodium salt) 3 times daily at 200 mg/kg i.p. for 6 weeks, and anticonvulsant and adverse effects during this period were studied. Groups of nonkindled rats were treated in parallel for determination of VPA and its major active metabolites in various brain regions after different durations of treatment. After the first injection of VPA, 200 mg/kg, seizure severity, seizure duration and duration of electrical afterdischarges recorded from the stimulated amygdala were reduced significantly, but only one of nine animals was protected completely from kindled seizures. At day 3 of chronic treatment, the anticonvulsant activity of VPA had increased markedly so that seven of nine animals were totally protected from seizures. However, this potent anticonvulsant effect was only transitory so that after 1 week of treatment the anticonvulsant effect of the medication was similar to that obtained after the first dosing. The effect of VPA remained at this level for the subsequent weeks, but there was a second, more permanent increase in the number of protected animals after 4 to 6 weeks. Plasma and brain levels of VPA and its metabolites remained relatively constant throughout the chronic treatment although there was a moderate accumulation of some metabolites, e.g., trans isomer of 2-propyl-2-pentenoic acid, in specific brain nuclei. The most prominent adverse effects of VPA were ataxia, muscle relaxation, wet-dog shake behavior and an increase in body temperature. Except for body temperature, tolerance developed to these adverse effects, but escape from wet-dog shake behavior occurred much more rapidly than reduction of other adverse effects. Pathohistological examination of liver sections from animals treated with VPA for 6 weeks showed no indication of any hepatotoxic effects. After drug withdrawal, kindled seizure parameters returned toward control values without evidence of significant carry-over effects. Five days after termination of treatment, only minute amounts of VPA and trans isomer of 2-propyl-2-pentenoic acid were determined in some brain regions, indicating that there was no persistence of active drug or metabolite concentrations in the brain.\r"

In the present study, we examined the contribution of arachidonic acid metabolites, via the cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase pathways, to the hypoxia (25 +/- 3 torr)- and anoxia (0 +/- 2 torr)-induced contractions of isolated pulmonary venules. Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (5 microM) or ibuprofen (10 microM) nor the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid (5 microM) or U 60257B (10 microM) affected the contractile responses. Similarly, the LT receptor antagonists FPL 57231 (3 microM) or LY 163443 (1 microM), at concentrations that inhibited LT-induced venular contractions, did not significantly affect the responses to hypoxia or anoxia. In fact, anoxia suppressed spontaneous LT release from the venules. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor SKF-525A (500 microM) nonselectively depressed venular contractions induced by decreased PO2 and pharmacological agents. Induction of the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system with beta-naphthoflavone did not alter venular contractions induced by hypoxia or anoxia. Contractions of isolated guinea pig pulmonary venules elicited by decreased PO2 are not mediated by 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase metabolites. Furthermore, the data do not support a role for cytochrome P-450 metabolites of endogenous substrates in these contractions.\r"

  ".W": "We demonstrated previously that alpha-1 adrenergic catecholamines modulate cardiac automaticity in a manner that is dependent upon the function of a pertussis toxin sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein). Furthermore, we demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation promotes the accumulation of inositol monophosphate (IP1). In the present study we used high-pressure liquid chromatography to resolve individual inositol phosphate isomers formed in norepinephrine-stimulated cultured rat ventricular myocytes. Norepinephrine stimulated a rapid, transient increase in 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) which was followed by slower, sustained increases in 1,3,4-IP3, inositol bisphosphate (IP2) and IP1. IP1 was composed of two major isomers with retention times characteristic of 1-IP1 and 4-IP1. 4-IP1 was the predominant IP1 isomer formed during stimulation with norepinephrine suggesting that the polyphosphoinositides rather than phosphatidylinositol are the principal targets of norepinephrine-stimulated phospholipase C activity in the heart. This was confirmed in studies performed on myocyte membranes which demonstrated proportionately greater IP2 and IP3 (relative to IP1) accumulation in response to norepinephrine. G protein regulation of alpha-1 adrenergic-dependent inositol phospholipid hydrolysis also was examined. In myocyte membranes, guanosine-5'-0-(3-thiotriphosphate) induced the accumulation of IP2 and IP3 and was required for the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine. This response was not impaired after pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These results indicate that the myocyte alpha-1 adrenergic receptor is coupled to a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C by a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein and suggest that under certain conditions IP3 may serve an important role in alpha-1 adrenergic modulation of cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces uterine contractions in an in vitro system. As an initial approach to elucidating the cellular mechanism for this action of EGF, we have characterized this effect pharmacologically in uteri from castrate, estrogenprimed mature rats. EGF-induced contractions are observed in both intact tissue and isolated myometrium, are dependent on extracellular calcium and are inhibited by nifedipine and chlorpromazine. Both indomethacin and nordihydroguaritic acid (NGA) inhibit EGF-induced uterine contractions. At the maximum doses which do not affect contractile responses to prostaglandin E2 or carbachol, indomethacin (10 microM) alone or NGA (1 microM) alone only decrease the effect of EGF by 60 to 80%, but indomethacin and NGA in combination abolish totally the response to the growth factor. Arachidonic acid also causes uterine contractions in this system. EGF increases uterine contractions in the presence of a submaximal (1 microM) but not a maximal (10 microM) dose of arachidonic acid. These findings suggest that EGF-induced contractions result from a mobilization of myometrial arachidonic acid, production of intermediates via both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase catalyzed pathways and a resultant influx of extracellular calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Sclerosing peritonitis is a serious complication in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis; it markedly decreases transport of water and solute across the peritoneal membrane. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, organic compounds (i.e., plasticizers) from plastic tubing and dialysis bags have been suggested to be a cause of the syndrome. The effects of three such compounds on water and sodium transport in vitro were studied in the toad bladder. The compounds studied were didodecylphthalate, dioctylphthalate, and benzylbutylphthalate. After 4 hr incubation in vitro, dioctylphthalate and benzylbutylphthalate significantly inhibited vasopressin-stimulated water flow in toad bladder. Basal water flow was not affected by any of the three compounds. Sodium transport, as measured using short-circuit current, was decreased to an equivalent degree by all compounds; inhibition of short-circuit current was dose dependent and was approximately 30% at 10(-3) M. The onset of action was between 3.5 and 4 hr, and the effect on short-circuit current was not reversible. These results demonstrate that the plasticizers (to which patients of all sorts are commonly exposed) inhibit transport across living membranes. In the toad bladder these compounds decrease sodium transport and maximal water flow. Although other evidence suggests that the cumulative toxic effects of these compounds may play a causal role in sclerosing peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis, our study suggests that chronic exposure to the phthalate acid esters in patients with normal renal function may result in sodium wastage, polyuria, and a concentrating defect resistant to AVP.\r"

  ".W": "Contractile effects of serotonin were compared to those of carbamylcholine and prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha in an effort to characterize serotonergic receptor activation in rat stomach fundus. All three agents elicited concentration-dependent contractions of fundal strips with serotonin (EC50 = 2 X 10(-10) M) being approximately 100-fold more potent than carbamylcholine (EC50 = 2 X 10(-8) M) and PGF2, (EC50 = 10(-8) M). The calcium channel blockers, diltiazem (5 X 10(-7) to 5 X 10(-5) M) and nitrendipine (10(-8) to 10(-5) M), attenuated responses markedly to serotonin and PGF2 alpha whereas having only minimal effects on carbamylcholine-induced contractions. Neither serotonin (10(-11) to 10(-5) M) nor PGF2 alpha (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) altered [3H]inositol monophosphate generation in fundus whereas carbamylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) increased significantly [3H]inositol monophosphate with 10(-5) M eliciting an 8-fold increase. Strips of fundus contracted submaximally with either serotonin, PGF2 alpha or carbamylcholine were compared for sensitivity to relaxants. Pinacidil (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) was equipotent (EC50 = 0.1 microM) in relaxing serotonin- and PGF2 alpha-contracted tissues. In contrast, pinacidil was 10-fold less potent in relaxing contractions produced by carbamylcholine. Likewise, nitroglycerin (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) and isoproterenol (10(-12) to 10(-7) M) were at least 10-fold more potent in relaxing serotonin- and PGF2 alpha- than carbamylcholine-induced contractions. Thus, in rat fundus, contractions associated with increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis may be more resistant to relaxation than are contractions not associated with altered phosphoinositide hydrolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After i.v. bolus administration, the imipenem concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rose to a peak within 30 min and declined with time. The CSF/serum unbound concentration ratio of imipenem was 0.22 at 2 hr after i.v. administration, substantially higher than that reported for benzylpenicillin. By using an in situ brain perfusion technique, we found that imipenem was transported through the blood-brain barrier principally via passive diffusion with a permeability-surface area product comparable to that of mannitol. In vitro, imipenem was accumulated by the isolated choroid plexus via an active organic anion transport system, although much less rapidly than benzylpenicillin. In vivo, after i.c.v. administration, imipenem was cleared from the CNS in a manner comparable to that of mannitol with only a small probenecid-sensitive process. Imipenem thus has minimal affinity for the organic anion transport system in the choroid plexus, resulting in the slow elimination of this drug from the CNS. These results suggest that the difference between imipenem and benzylpenicillin in the ratio of CSF to unbound serum drug concentration is determined principally by the efflux process in the choroid plexus rather than the influx process through the blood-brain barrier.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of diets enriched in gamma linolenic acid (GLA) on acute inflammation induced by monosodium urate crystals, and on subacute and chronic inflammation induced by complete Freund's adjuvant in the rat subcutaneous air pouch and in rats with adjuvant induced arthritis. Diets were enriched (15% fat) with borage seed oil (23% GLA) or safflower oil (less than 1% GLA). Diets enriched with GLA suppressed inflammation markedly in all models, whereas the safflower oil diet did not influence the inflammatory response. The degree of inflammation was quantified by measuring pouch exudate cell concentration, lysosomal enzyme activity, volume, protein concentration and prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 concentrations. In the chronic air pouch model, the pouch lining was thickened, invaded by mononuclear cells and exhibited proliferation of lining cells 14 days after adjuvant injection. The lesion was far less severe and usual pouch lining architecture was maintained in animals given dietary GLA. Livers of rats fed borage seed oil were enriched in GLA and dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA), and the DGLA/arachidonate ratio was increased 5-fold compared with animals fed safflower oil. Enrichment of diet with plant seed oils rich in GLA may provide a way to alter generation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and to influence acute and chronic inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".W": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is a safe and effective arterial contrast agent that images arteries by displacing blood. The use of CO2 gas to displace blood during angioscopy may improve intraoperative angioscopy and allow percutaneous angioscopy. To study this, 46 angioscopic evaluations in the femoral arteries of four dogs were done without inflow occlusion. The ability of CO2 gas to clear the flowing blood was compared to a high-pressure infusion of saline solution. Carbon dioxide gas successfully displaced flowing blood in 20 of 25 evaluations (80%) as compared to three of 21 evaluations (14%) with infusion of saline solution (p less than 0.0001). After the CO2 gas infusion was stopped, the image remained clear for 9 +/- 1 seconds. When saline was used, the image was clear only as long as the infusion was continued. The quality of clear images for the two media were similar through the eyepiece of the angioscope, but images observed through the motion picture camera had better contrast and depth of field in CO2 gas. The use of a CO2 gas infusion can clear the field of flowing blood without the risk of volume overloading and potentially allow performance of a successful percutaneous angioscopy.\r"

The model considers the cost of performing a trial and the benefits to the health status of a target population one could expect before the trial was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness for performing the trials ranged from a low of $2 to $3 per life-year saved for a trial of aspirin in unstable angina to a high of $396 to $685 per life-year saved for the randomized trial portion of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study. These ratios were substantially lower (ie, more economically attractive) than the cost-effectiveness ratios associated with performing interventions of proved effectiveness. This study shows that a selected group of clinical trials, some of which were controversial and expensive, were indeed a good investment. This information may be helpful to policymakers who consider allocating funds to biomedical research.\r"

A major mechanism for processing this information involves the sequential interactions of three membrane-bound proteins. Receptors for many extracellular regulators bind these molecules and interact with one or more of a family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Conformational alteration of the G protein permits exchange of tightly bound guanosine diphosphate (an inactive ligand) for guanosine triphosphate (the activating ligand). The guanosine triphosphate-bound G protein in turn interacts with intracellular effector molecules, such as adenylyl cyclase, and controls their functions.\r"

Although evaluation of the appropriateness of transfusion therapy is now required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations, health care facilities have little experience with this aspect of professional quality assurance. To this end, the Committee on Transfusion Practices of the American Association of Blood Banks, in Arlington, Va, in this report has provided examples of indications and audit criteria for individual blood components and products and commented on areas of controversy surrounding their use. Audit criteria from different institutions may vary because of differences in local interpretation of the indication, different patient populations, and, in some instances, the availability of blood and laboratory services. Several approaches to the review of transfusion practices are discussed in relation to clinical settings and pertaining to particular blood components. It is evident from these examples that there will be an increased need for trained personnel to perform the initial review process as well as for physicians trained in transfusion medicine to oversee the transfusions and provide the necessary consultation.\r"

Patients were further randomized to receive on the first 4 postoperative days a) a standard dextrose-saline regimen (DS), b) an amino acid regimen (AA), or c) a glucose-amino acid-fat regimen (GAF) via a peripheral vein. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates were calculated pre- and postoperatively using indirect calorimetry. Postoperative nitrogen balance (NB) in patients receiving amino acids was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) by the administration of stanozolol. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates were not significantly affected by stanozolol. Patients in the stanozolol and control AA groups showed a fall in carbohydrate oxidation (p less than 0.01) and a rise in fat oxidation (p less than 0.05) postoperatively, whereas no significant changes in fat and carbohydrate oxidation occurred in the two DS and two GAF groups. Cumulative NB for the first 4 postoperative days was significantly better (p less than 0.01) in the two AA groups than in the two DS groups, due to an improved NB in the two AA groups on the 1st and 2nd days only. Cumulative NB in the two GAF groups was significantly better (p less than 0.01) than in all the other groups. This study shows that stanozolol improves postoperative NB in patients receiving amino acids alone, whereas the provision of a more complete nutritional regimen containing glucose, amino acids, and fat results in a positive NB unaffected by stanozolol.\r"

Group A consisted of 14 patients who received PN for an average of 43 days (short term) whereas eight patients received PN for an average of 104 days (long term); group B. Nutritional assessments were performed before and following the PN periods. In addition, a follow-up assessment was performed 50 days after the cessation of PN for group A. Serial evaluations included; weight, height, disease activity score, arm anthropometry, subscapular skinfold (SSSF) thickness, 24-hr urinary creatinine, and computed tomography (CT) scan of the thigh. Following PN with a glucose-fat mixture used as a nonprotein energy source, there were significant (p less than 0.05) increases in weight, SSSF, and muscle mass (MM) in both groups. Disease activity declined in both groups and height increased in group B and at the follow-up assessment for group A. Considering extremity composition, both groups exhibited increases in midarm muscle area, midarm fat area, thigh muscle area, and thigh fat area. However, a differential distribution of incremental change was observed depending on the duration of PN. Fat deposition predominated in both the upper and lower extremities for group A. Group B patients, however, although showing a predominance of fat accumulation in the upper extremities, gained muscle and fat components equally in the lower extremities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study objective was to determine each patient's caloric intake from tube feeding relative to their energy needs and to identify factors causing decreased feeding intake. Each of 35 patients was visited at least once daily to determine their volumetric intake of tube feeding formula. Daily review of patient care records and nursing interviews were used to identify interruptions in therapy. Patient's basal energy expenditures (BEE) were calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation. Calorie goals were set by members of the Nutrition Support Service or clinical dietitians. Intakes averaged 1095 +/- 41 Kcal (SEM) per day or 61% of their mean calorie goal of 1791 +/- 41 Kcal. Mean daily calorie intake was statistically different (p less than 0.05) from mean energy goal on patient study days 1 through 5, 7, and 8. Only 16 of the 35 patients achieved an intake of 100% of their energy goal on any day of therapy. Calorie goals averaged 1.4 times BEE. Mean daily calorie intake did not exceed BEE until study day 10. Eighteen % of potential feeding time was lost due to temporary feeding interruptions; primarily inadvertent extubation (4.6%), gastrointestinal intolerance (4.7%), medical procedures requiring discontinuation of feeding (2.8%), and feeding tube positioning difficulties (1.5%). In addition, physicians ordered only 75% of calculated energy goals. These data indicate that tube feeding therapy, when provided under usual hospital conditions, does not meet patient's energy requirements.\r"

Subjects were studied in malnutritional conditions and after 20 to 30 days of parenteral and enteral refeeding treatment. Immunoreactive IGF-I concentration was 0.35 U/ml +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SEM), significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in age-matched controls (1.14 +/- 0.07 U/ml, n = 29) and rose significantly (0.84 +/- 0.12 U/ml; p less than 0.01) in parallel with the improvement of nutritional status. The ratios TBNa/TBW, TBNa/TBK, and TBK/TBW were then considered as reference parameters for definition of malnutritional state, and compared with IGF-I as well as with the most commonly used parameters, albumin and transferrin. Before treatment, IGF-I evidenced higher specificity (true negative ratios 0.63, 0.43, and 0.40 with regard to TBNa/TBW, TBNa/TBK, and TBK/TBW, respectively) than albumin (0.13, 0.14, and 0.10) and transferrin (0 in all cases), and slightly less sensitivity (true positive ratios for IGF-I 0.80, 0.67, and 0.67; always one for albumin and transferrin). Moreover, IGF-I resulted definitely more sensitive in assessing the effectiveness of the refeeding treatment and, on the basis of the likelihood ratio, it appeared a good discriminator of the nutritional status. The data indicate that different nutritional factors regulate IGF-I, albumin, and transferrin, and suggest that IGF-I can be used as a reliable and specific nutritional parameter, complementary to the others currently used.\r"

  ".W": "Morphologic and functional hepatic changes occur in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with this disease often require the administration of artificial nutritional support. Liver function tests (LFT) derangement is a widely recognized side-effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Therefore, the use of this modality of nutritional support may be an additional factor to cause hepatic damage in IBD patients. However whether or not the same occurs in patients receiving total enteral nutrition (TEN) is not well-established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of TEN upon LFT in patients with moderate to severe acute attacks of IBD, by means of a prospective, controlled, and nonrandomized design. Forty-nine patients were included; 29 (11 patients with ulcerative colitis and 18 with Crohn's disease) received TEN, and 20 (11 with ulcerative colitis and 9 with Crohn's disease) did not. Both groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, disease activity index, nutritional status, and length of the study (24.8 +/- 1.3 vs 23.9 +/- 16.8 days). In all cases, weekly measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, GOT, and GPT were performed. There were no significant differences in LFT at the beginning of the study between groups. The percentage of patients showing derangement of some LFT during the study did not differ between both groups: six of 29 (20.6%) in TEN group vs three of 20 (15%) in control group. Six out of the nine patients (in both groups) who developed LFT derangement had one or more causes, other than TEN for explaining hepatic dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only papers dealing with adult cancer patients and providing data regarding type of tumor, duration of the nutritional support, and administration rate of calories and amino acids, validated by statistical analysis of the results, are included. The main conclusions are the following: (1) No nutritional variable worsened in cancer patients receiving TPN or EN, in conditions in which progressive deterioration of the nutritional status is the rule. (2) The nutritional variables improved by TPN and EN were body weight, fat mass, and some indicators of lean body mass (nitrogen balance and whole body potassium). Thyroxin-binding prealbumin and retinol-binding protein increased only with TPN, whereas some immunologic indexes (complement factors and lymphocytes) improved only with EN. (3) The daily regimens which improved lean body mass and visceral proteins ranged from 35 to 55 kcal/kg and from 1.2 to 2.0 g of amino acids/kg for TPN; for EN it was 35 kcal/kg and 1.3 g of amino acids/kg. However, the enteral regimen capable of improving some immune responses included at least 42 kcal/kg and 2.3 g of amino acids/kg. (4) Only three randomized studies were performed to compare TPN and EN, and conflicting results were obtained. Only TPN showed some significant advantages with regard to weight gain, nitrogen balance, maintenance of serum albumin levels and some mineral balances. However, the advantage of TPN was not clear enough to recommend its indiscriminate use. The choice between TPN and EN should always consider the functionality of the GI tract, the need for hospitalization to start a TPN regimen, and the higher cost of intravenous feeding. (5) When comparing TPN to a standard oral diet, the following variables improved with the nutritional support: body weight, nitrogen balance, 3-methylhistidine, urinary excretion, and serum levels of transferrin, cholinesterase, thyroxin-binding prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein. (6) When comparing TPN with glucose vs TPN with glucose-lipids, no major difference was found with regard to most nutritional variables. In conclusion, nutritional support alone probably has a small role in managing a limited number of advanced cancer patients dying primarily because of malnutrition or mainly suffering from nutritional deterioration. It can also have a \"permissive\" role in those patients potentially candidate to an oncologic treatment which cannot be delivered because of a poor nutritional status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Estimated total aluminum absorptions were 56.7 mg, and 28 mg, twin A and twin B, respectively. At autopsy, Twin A had a hypoplastic right kidney while Twin B had normal kidneys. Mean plasma aluminum levels (twin A, 34.2 micrograms/liter and twin B, 32.3 micrograms/liter) and urinary aluminum levels expressed as aluminum creatinine ratios (twin A, 11.3 and twin B, 8.5) were similar. These levels were elevated compared to normal plasma aluminum levels of 5.1 +/- 3.6 (1 SD) and urinary aluminum creatinine ratios of 0.64 +/- 0.75 (1 SD). Twin A had higher tissue aluminum levels than twin B in all tissues except for brain. Bone and liver aluminum contents for both twins were increased as compared to infants receiving short-term or no parenteral nutrition. We conclude; (1) tissue aluminum loading occurs in infants receiving aluminum-containing solutions, (2) plasma and urinary aluminum levels are poor predictors of tissue aluminum content, (3) enteral solutions may add significant aluminum exposure.\r"

Four hours following unilateral nephrectomy in rats, soluble (100,000 g supernatant) proteins in the contralateral kidney were increased by 11% compared to sham operated controls; the increase was 33% 144 hours following surgery. The specific activity of PKC did not change in the cytosol at any of the time periods examined and averaged 63.9 +/- 8.2 pmol.mg-1.min-1 in unilaterally nephrectomized animals four hours following surgery. Four hours following sham surgery total soluble PKC activity averaged 1667.0 +/- 278.4 pmol.kidney-1.min-1, whereas activity averaged 3067.7 +/- 415.4 pmol.kidney-1.min-1 in animals post-nephrectomy (N = 5, P less than 0.04). Similar data was seen 144 hours following surgery. To examine the PKC activity in plasma membranes of proximal tubular cells, brush border membranes were prepared from rat kidney cortex. Twenty-four hours following unilateral nephrectomy, activity averaged 193.8 +/- 14.9 pmol.mg-1.min-1, while activity in membranes isolated from sham operated animals averaged 76.6 +/- 8.0 pmol.mg-1.min-1 (N = 5, P less than 0.001). Similar data was evident 48 hours following surgery. A small increment in activity was seen in the basolateral membrane preparation 24 hours following unilateral nephrectomy but not at 48 hours. These data indicate that cellular PKC activity increases rapidly following reductions in renal mass, and there are selective increments in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubular cell. The localization of PKC to this membrane may have important consequences for adaptations following nephron loss.\r"

Using single intraperitoneal injections of biotinylated human albumin, transferrin, IgG, and complement components as tracers, the integrity of the BNB during degeneration and regeneration was determined over time. In Wallerian degeneration induced by crush the BNB became increasingly leaky, with a maximum in the distal stump 8 days after crush (i.e., during early regeneration). When regeneration potentials could first be elicited from the small foot muscles and when thinly myelinated nerve fibers were present, the BNB gradually regained its barrier function and was nearly intact on day 30 after crush. After transsection breakdown of the BNB persisted beyond 30 days. The BNB leakage may foster repair by allowing exchange of trophic factors of large molecular size during nerve regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Clonal, fusing, mouse skeletal muscle cells (C2) were grown to the myotube stage (90% confluence) before they were subjected to isotope-containing serum-free media (3H-proline or 35S-methionine). C2 myotubes secrete and organize a biosynthetically labeled matrix which adheres to the plastic after removal of myotubes with detergent and ammonium hydroxide. When these homotypic-labeled myotube matrices were incubated with myoblast-conditioned media containing high specific activity urokinase-type plasminogen activator, slow, but clearly detectable, release of label occurred. However, degradation of matrix, with solubilization of label, was accelerated sixfold by addition of human plasminogen to diluted myoblast-conditioned media. If protease nexin I, a cellular serine protease inhibitor purified from human fibroblast-conditioned media, was added (0.2 microgram/ml) with plasminogen, inhibition of matrix hydrolysis by 52% occurred. Higher concentrations (0.8 microgram/ml or above) of protease nexin 1 completely inhibited the degradation of extracellular matrix components. A similar protease inhibitor was purified from C2 myotube-conditioned media, and this molecule also inhibited the plasminogen-dependent release of extracellular matrix. We propose that protease nexin 1 inhibits the destruction of myotube matrix by inactivating the plasmin/plasminogen activation system and may be the physiologic regulator of this system during muscle development in vivo.\r"

The presence of a 110K and 98K form of acid alpha-glucosidase was confirmed in normal controls by immunoblotting. However the 98K form was absent in the affected quails. Subcellular distribution studies demonstrated that the 98K form, but not the 110K form, was localized in the lysosomes. This suggests that the 110K form is a precursor of the mature 98K form of acid alpha-glucosidase. In the affected quails, the 110K precursor is synthesized, but maturation to the 98K form does not occur or may be extremely deficient.\r"

  ".W": "The A4 protein (or beta-protein) is a 42- or 43-amino-acid peptide present in the extracellular neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease and is derived from a membrane-bound amyloid protein precursor (APP). Three forms of APP have been described and are referred to as APP695, APP751 and APP770, reflecting the number of amino acids encoded for by their respective complementary DNAs. The two larger APPs contain a 57-amino-acid insert with striking homology to the Kunitz family of protease inhibitors. Here we report that the deduced amino-terminal sequence of APP is identical to the sequence of a cell-secreted protease inhibitor, protease nexin-II (PN-II). To confirm this finding, APP751 and APP695 cDNAs were over-expressed in the human 293 cell line, and the secreted N-terminal extracellular domains of these APPs were purified to near homogeneity from the tissue-culture medium. The relative molecular mass and high-affinity binding to dextran sulphate of secreted APP751 were consistent with that of PN-II. Functionally, secreted APP751 formed stable, non-covalent, inhibitory complexes with trypsin. Secreted APP695 did not form complexes with trypsin. We conclude that the secreted form of APP with the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain is PN-II.\r"

Here we report another example of divergence from the universal code, this time in a non-spore-forming yeast Candida cylindracea, in which the universal codon for leucine, CUG, is used to code for serine. This conclusion is based on the observations that: (1) the amino-acid composition and the partial amino-acid sequences of an extracellular lipase from this yeast agreed with those deduced from the complementary DNA if CUG was assumed to specify serine; and (2) serine, but not leucine, was incorporated into a polypeptide in a cell-free translation system from this yeast in the presence of a synthetic CUG oligomer.\r"

  ".W": "The TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) responsive element (TRE) is recognized by the inducible transcription factor AP1, a heterodimeric complex of Fos- and Jun-protein subunits, which each contain a specific structure known as the leucine zipper through which they interact. Studies using site-directed mutagenesis have shown that a basic region adjacent to the leucine zipper in Fos is crucial for the interaction of the Fos-Jun complex with the TRE, and probably represents a site of interaction with DNA. The functionally crucial amino acids in this region are almost completely conserved between Fos and Jun (refs 6, 7 and 11; M.N. and R.M., unpublished results), indicating the formation of a nearly symmetrical DNA-binding site in the Fos-Jun complex. Whereas Jun can form a homodimeric protein complex which binds to the TRE, Fos is unable to do so. The Fos-Jun heterodimer, however, possesses at least a 30-fold-higher affinity for the TRE than does the Jun-Jun homodimer, indicating cooperative binding. Because Fos cannot form a homodimer it is not known whether Fos specifically recognizes part of the TRE or has a different role in the binding of the Fos-Jun complex to DNA. Here we report that exchanging the leucine zipper in Fos with that of Jun generates a protein (termed psi-Fos) that can form a complex with Fos. This Fos-psi-Fos complex, and to a lesser extent a homodimeric psi-Fos complex, exhibits specific binding to the TRE. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that Fos and Jun form a nearly symmetrical DNA-binding site that interacts with the palindromic TRE.\r"

Because the saving in sulphur would increase with such accumulating mutations, Met and Cys changes could be progressively selected. Abundant proteins should be the prime targets of such a selection. A few published observations give credence to this scenario. Sulphate permease, which is abundantly produced by sulphur-starved Salmonella typhimurium, lacks Met and Cys residues. Also, two species of marine purple bacteria synthesize more protein than can be expected from a limited sulphate supply. We now report that the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. PCC 7601 (referred to here as Calothrix) encodes sulphur-depleted versions of its most abundant proteins--phycocyanin and its auxiliary polypeptides--which it specifically expresses under conditions of sulphur limitation. Although these proteins do not take part in the fixation of sulphur, their elevated synthesis affects the sulphur budget of cyanobacterial cells. Direct evidence is thus provided that the structure of macromolecules can be subject to metabolic optimization.\r"

  ".W": "Satellite DNA refers to a class of tandem repeats of very simple sequences, usually A + T or G + C rich, which form a satellite band on a CsCl gradient. Their ubiquity and abundance in higher eukaryotes have led to speculation about their functions. It has often been suggested that satellite DNAs are merely innocuous genetic parasites or comprise 'junk' DNA. The recent identification of an array of satellite DNA repeats as the Responder (Rsp) locus of Drosophila melanogaster provides a new perspective on these elements. Rsp is in the centromeric heterochromatin of most natural second chromosomes. It causes spermatids bearing it to degenerate after meiosis when the homologous second chromosome is a Segregation Distorter (SD) chromosome. That is, SD targets the Rsp locus on its homologue for destruction during spermatogenesis, causing meiotic drive. Why then does the Rsp locus, a large array of satellite repeats, exist at all? One plausible explanation is that its existence contributes to the fitness of flies bearing it, compensating for the loss through meiotic drive. A direct demonstration of the usefulness of any family of satellite DNA is to compare the fitnesses of individuals with and without it. Previously, such an experiment has been difficult because the absence of a characteristic phenotype has precluded an efficient selection of deletion mutations. In this report we attempt to demonstrate a fitness reduction associated with the deletion of Rsp satellite DNA as well as the life stages at which such a reduction occurs.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years the capacity of proteins to bend DNA by binding to specific sites has become a widely appreciated phenomenon. In many cases, the protein-DNA interaction is known to be functionally significant because destruction of the DNA site or the protein itself results in an altered phenotype. An important question to be answered in these cases is whether bending of DNA is important per se or is merely a consequence of the way a particular protein binds to DNA. Here we report direct evidence from the bacteriophage lambda integration system that a bend introduced by a protein is intrinsically important. We find that a binding site for a specific recombination protein known to bend DNA can be successfully replaced by two other modules that also bend DNA; related modules that fail to bend DNA are ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "Many of the structures responsible for replication, transcription initiation and recombination arise from complex sets of protein-protein interactions and the folding of DNA in three dimensions, with protein-induced bending of DNA often playing an integral role. The magnitude and orientation of DNA bending induced by various single proteins has been estimated by gel mobility shift methods and by modelling of crystallographic data. The site-specific recombination by which bacteriophage lambda (phage lambda) integrates into the chromosome of its host Escherichia coli requires a host protein, 'integration host factor' (IHF), which is known to be able to bend the DNA to which it binds. To determine the three-dimensional path of DNA within the higher order structure responsible for phage lambda site-specific recombination, we have determined the relative direction of IHF-induced bending at each of the three binding sites within the complex. IHF, which appears to bend DNA by more than 140 degrees, is a major determinant of the DNA path in the recombination complex and is also involved in a wide range of other cellular events.\r"

Increasing EDTA concentration from 0.1 mol/L to 0.5 mol/L causes a faster acid accumulation and a higher demineralization rate. The efficiency of EDTA solutions decreases as time goes on, probably because of the acid released from EDTAHNa3 (the predominating species under the neutral conditions). Not all the available EDTA reacts after a few hours. The so-called autolimitation might be due to this acidification of the EDTA solution.\r"

NTG was infused intravenously over periods of 10 min separated by wash-out periods. Doses of 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 micrograms/kg/min were applied successively with one placebo infusion and wash-out period inserted randomly and double blindly. The subjects scored their headache intensity on a scale 0-10. After 1-8 weeks a retest was performed. Nine subjects developed headache already at 0.25 microgram/kg/min, whereas one had no headache at any dose. Headache severity did not increase with doses above 0.5 microgram/kg/min. This ceiling effect was reproducible. The headache was moderate, usually throbbing, bifrontal and not associated with other migrainous features. It reached maximum within 2.5-5.5 min (medians) at various doses and declined rapidly after NTG discontinuation. Wash-out periods of 10-20 min were sufficient. The reproducibility of headache intensity and character was satisfactory in the retest experiment. There were no unpleasant side effects and no visible flushing. Thus blindness was maintained. I.v. NTG is suitable as an experimental headache model. A constant infusion of 0.5 microgram/kg/min will be suitable for studies of arterial diameter, pulsations, blood flow, etc. Comparative studies of sensitivity should use the present infusion schedule but with the two highest doses substituted by 0.06 and 0.125 microgram/kg/min.\r"

In the liver the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) activity was slightly higher in the D2 strain. The naloxone- and morphine-3'-glucuronide (N3G, M3G) formation rate ratio was close to 1 in both the brain and liver in all except the B6 strain, where it was 2.6 in the brain. There was a correlation between formation rate of M3G and N3G (r = 0.65 brain and r = 0.73 liver). Our results indicate a common glucuronidation pathway for morphine and naloxone.\r"

  ".W": "The Cu(II) sites of azurins, the blue single copper proteins, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Alcaligenes spp. (Iwasaki) are reduced by CO2- radicals, produced by pulse radiolysis, in two distinct reaction steps: (i) a fast bimolecular phase, at the rates (5.0 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) M-1.s-1 (P. aeruginosa) and (6.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(8) M-1.s-1 (Alcaligenes); (ii) a slow unimolecular phase with specific rates of 44 +/- 7 s-1 in the former and 8.5 +/- 1.5 s-1 for the latter (all at 298 K, 0.1 M ionic strength). Concomitant with the fast reduction of Cu(II), the single disulfide bridge linking cysteine-3 to -26 in these proteins is reduced to the RSSR- radical ion as evidenced by its characteristic absorption band centered at 410 nm. This radical ion decays in a unimolecular process with a rate identical to that of the slow Cu(II) reduction phase in the respective protein, thus clearly suggesting that a long-range intramolecular electron transfer occurs between the RSSR- radicals and the Cu(II) site. The temperature dependence of the internal electron transfer process in both proteins was measured over the 4 degrees C to 42 degrees C range. The activation parameters derived are delta H* = 47.5 +/- 4.0 and 16.7 +/- 1.5 kJ.mol-1; and delta S not equal to = -56.5 +/- 7.0 and -171 +/- 18 J.K-1.mol-1, respectively. Using the Marcus theory, we found that the intramolecular electron transfer rates and their activation parameters observed for the two azurins correlate well with the distances between the reactive sites, their redox potential, and the nature of the separating medium. Thus, azurins with distinct structural and reactivity characteristics isolated from different bacteria or modified by site-directed mutagenesis can be used in comparing long-range electron transfer process between their conserved disulfide bridge and the Cu(II) sites.\r"

Furthermore, antibody against rat class I antigens showed an inhibitory effect on the generation of myotubes during muscle development. Although mature myotubes did not show any detectable levels of class I antigens on their cell surface, soluble factors from concanavalin A-activated spleen cells or interferon gamma could induce the expression of class I antigens on muscle fibers. These results suggest that the expression of class I antigens on muscle cells is not only immunologically modulated but also developmentally regulated and that the antigens may play a role in cell recognition and interactions during the fusion process of myogenesis.\r"

The corrected E alpha gene was transmitted to progeny, which were bred to homozygosity. Southern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the DNA spanning the deletion, and sequence analysis revealed that the corrected allele resembles the wild-type E alpha gene. At sites of single-base-pair polymorphisms, there was apparently random conversion to either the donor or recipient sequence. In addition, many point mutations were introduced. mRNAs were produced from the corrected allele in a tissue-specific manner, but their sizes were different from the wild-type allele, and they did not produce detectable E alpha protein. This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of targeting foreign DNA to a gene that is completely inactive in fertilized mouse eggs.\r"

Twenty-six patients had primarily chronic progressive MS and 74 had relapsing/remitting MS. The latter group included patients with a secondary progressive evolution of symptoms. Both clinical forms of MS were found to be associated with the DRw15,DQw6 haplotype. In addition, primarily chronic progressive MS was positively associated with the DQB1 restriction fragment pattern seen in DR4,DQw8, DR7,DQw9, and DRw8, DQw4 haplotypes, as well as negatively associated with the Taq I DQB1 allelic pattern corresponding to the serological specificity DQw7. Relapsing/remitting MS was positively associated with the DQB1 allelic pattern observed in the DRw17,DQw2 haplotype. These three DQB1 alleles are in strong negative linkage disequilibria with DRw15. The two susceptibility markers of each clinical form of MS act additively in determining the genetic susceptibility, as the relative risks for individuals carrying both markers roughly equal the sum of respective risks. Different alleles of the DQB1 locus defined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility and resistance to primarily chronic progressive MS as well as to susceptibility to relapsing/remitting MS. The observed immunogenetic heterogeneity between the different clinical forms of MS favors the hypothesis that primarily chronic progressive MS and relapsing/remitting MS are two distinct disease entities.\r"

Moreover, culture medium supplemented with low concentrations of L-Trp reversed the cytotoxic effect of IFN-gamma, whereas higher concentrations of L-Trp in the medium were extremely toxic to both parental and mutant cells. These mutants were still protected against herpes simplex virus infection by IFN-gamma and expressed the HLA-DR alpha gene normally in the presence of this lymphokine. Thus, the mutation in these cells is specific to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and not a global effect of an IFN-gamma-induced gene. This genetic evidence indicates that the major pathway of IFN-gamma cytotoxicity in this cell line is mediated primarily by induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and deprivation of L-Trp.\r"

A-type channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with Shaker B and Shaker D mRNA exhibited gating and voltage dependence that were qualitatively similar to those of the native Shaker A-types channels from embryonic myotubes. In all three channel types the molecular transition rates leading to the first opening were voltage-dependent, whereas all transitions after the first opening, including inactivation, were independent of voltage. While these channels exhibit some quantitative differences in their transition rates that account for the observed differences in macroscopic currents, in all three cases the voltage dependence of the macroscopic currents is determined by a voltage dependence in the time to first opening. This gating mechanism is similar to that of the vertebrate voltage-gated sodium channel and, together with the sequence similarities in the S4 region of the proteins, suggests a conserved mechanism for activation and inactivation.\r"

Control rats received an equivalent volume of normal rabbit serum (NRS). Intraventricular injection of the NRS lowered plasma GH concentrations significantly. The lowering was detected on first measurement at 10 min after injection and was maximal at 30 min. This was followed by a return toward the initial levels. Third ventricular injection of antiserum significantly increased plasma GH in comparison with control animals injected with NRS. The effect was observed within 10-20 min, and levels remained elevated for the 120-min duration of the experiment. To confirm the possible inhibitory role of endogenous SP on GH release, 3 microliters of 0.9% NaCl (saline) alone or saline containing a specific antagonist of SP, [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP, was injected into the third ventricle of normal male rats. The antagonist also increased plasma GH significantly (P less than 0.005) within 5 min compared with values in the saline-injected control group. Levels remained elevated for 30 min but had returned toward control values 60 min after injection. In contrast, synthetic SP significantly decreased plasma GH when injected intravenously or intraventricularly compared with plasma GH in the control saline-injected group. To investigate a possible direct action of SP on GH release from the anterior pituitary gland, we incubated synthetic SP with dispersed anterior pituitary cells for 1 hr. The release of GH from incubated anterior pituitary cells was not affected at any dose of SP (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) tested. These data strongly indicate that endogenous SP has a physiological inhibitory role in the control of GH secretion at the level of the hypothalamus in the male rat.\r"

Pluripotent stem cell lines were isolated with homologously recombined insertions at three different loci: c-fos, which is expressed at a low level in ES cells, and two genes, adipsin and adipocyte P2 (aP2), which are transcribed specifically in adipose cells and are not expressed at detectable levels in ES cells. The frequencies at which homologous recombination events occurred did not correlate with levels of expression of the targeted genes, but did occur at rates comparable to those previously reported for genes that are actively expressed in ES cells. Injection of successfully targeted cells into mouse blastocysts resulted in the formation of chimeric mice. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of altering genes in ES cells that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the mouse, in order to study their function at later developmental stages.\r"

In order to investigate the possibility that recognition of these conserved sequences may sometimes permit intergenic joining of segments among different antigen receptor genes, DNA of normal human lymphoid tissues was examined by polymerase chain reaction amplification for the presence of chimeric gamma-delta T cell receptor gene rearrangements. These studies detected V gamma-(D delta)-J delta and V delta-(D delta)-J gamma rearrangements in thymus, peripheral blood, and tonsil. Analysis of thymus RNA indicated that many of these rearrangements are expressed as V gamma-(D delta)-J delta-C delta and V delta-(D delta)-J gamma-C gamma transcripts. Most transcripts (19 of 20 complementary DNA clones studied) are appropriately spliced and show correct open translational reading frames across the V-(D)-J junctions. Thus, chimeric antigen receptor genes are generated in a subset of normal lymphoid cells, probably as a result of chromosomal translocations, and such genes may possibly contribute to increased diversity within the antigen receptor repertoire.\r"

These receptors contain high-affinity binding sites for benzodiazepines. However, CL 218 872, 2-oxoquazepam, and methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) show a temperature-modulated selectivity for alpha 1 subunit-containing receptors. There were no significant differences in the binding of clonazepam, diazepam, Ro 15-1788, or dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) to all three recombinant receptors. Receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit show greater GABA potentiation of benzodiazepine binding than receptors containing the alpha 1 or alpha 2 subunit, indicating that there are subtypes within the type II class. Thus, diversity in benzodiazepine pharmacology is generated by heterogeneity of the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A plasma membrane form of guanylate cyclase is a cell surface receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In response to ANP binding, the receptor-enzyme produces increased amounts of the second messenger, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Maximal activation of the cyclase requires the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. The intracellular region of the receptor contains at least two domains with homology to other proteins, one possessing sequence similarity to protein kinase catalytic domains, the other to regions of unknown function in a cytoplasmic form of guanylate cyclase and in adenylate cyclase. It is now shown that the protein kinase-like domain functions as a regulatory element and that the second domain possesses catalytic activity. When the kinase-like domain was removed by deletion mutagenesis, the resulting ANP receptor retained guanylate cyclase activity, but this activity was independent of ANP and its stimulation by ATP was markedly reduced. A model for signal transduction is suggested in which binding of ANP to the extracellular domain of its receptor initiates a conformational change in the protein kinase-like domain, resulting in derepression of guanylate cyclase activity.\r"

A major threat to the stability of the retinal image comes from the observer's own movement, and there are visual and vestibular reflexes that operate to meet this challenge by generating compensatory eye movements. The ocular responses to translational disturbances of the observer and of the scene were recorded from monkeys. The associated vestibular and visual responses were both linearly dependent on the inverse of the viewing distance. Such dependence on proximity is appropriate for the vestibular reflex, which must transform signals from Cartesian to polar coordinates, but not for the visual reflex, which operates entirely in polar coordinates. However, such shared proximity effects in the visual reflex could compensate for known intrinsic limitations that would otherwise compromise performance at near viewing.\r"

Molecular cloning reveals that the synapsins comprise a family of four homologous proteins whose messenger RNA's are generated by differential splicing of transcripts from two genes. Each synapsin is a mosaic composed of homologous amino-terminal domains common to all synapsins and different combinations of distinct carboxyl-terminal domains. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that all four synapsins are widely distributed in nerve terminals, but that their relative amounts vary among different kinds of synapses. The structural diversity and differential distribution of the four synapsins suggest common and different roles of each in the integration of distinct signal transduction pathways that modulate neurotransmitter release in various types of neurons.\r"

The activity of a key enzyme in the formation of inositol tetrakisphosphates, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate 3-kinase, was increased six- to eightfold in cytosolic extracts prepared from the v-src-transformed cells, suggesting that this enzyme may be one target for the pp60v-src kinase and that it may participate in the synthesis of novel, higher order inositol phosphates.\r"

The medical records of all patients who underwent surgical procedures for scoliosis and spondylolisthesis between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1986 were reviewed. From this group, 918 patients with negative medical histories for prior homologous blood transfusion, hepatitis, or the exposure to hepatotoxic medications were selected. All of the patients received two or more units of homologous blood and were followed for at least 1 year postoperatively. Eight hundred fifty-nine (94%) of the patients were either personally interviewed or contacted by mail. The group included 697 scoliosis patients (average age 16.2) and 162 spondylolisthesis patients (average age, 16.8). The scoliosis and spondylolisthesis patients received an average of 5.6 and 3.4 units of homologous blood, respectively. Three patients (0.35%) developed posttransfusion hepatitis, all non-A non-B. The incubation period was 9 to 12 weeks. Presenting symptoms varied widely, ranging from no symptoms to marked icterus. Two of the three patients went on to develop chronic persistent hepatitis, which was confirmed by liver biopsy. The incidence identified in this retrospective study was low when compared with an overall incidence of 4 to 15%, as presented in several larger prospective studies. Non-A, non-B hepatitis is a major risk associated with the homologous transfusion of blood and must be considered one of the more serious complications in surgery for spinal deformity.\r"

In addition to effects on water and salt balance, it is a potent vasodilator, as well as inhibitor of renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and vasopressin. ANF is primarily produced in the atria, but production in the brain is suggestive of action as a neuropeptide and as a potential regulator of CSF production. Receptors are found throughout the heart, vascular tree, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain. The stimulus for release appears to be atrial stretch, which may be secondary to intravascular fluid changes. It causes hemoconcentration and may be an important regulator of interstitial fluid distribution as well as capillary permeability. Patients with CHF and renal failure have been found to have elevated levels that decrease in response to treatment. Potentially, it may be useful as a therapeutic agent in acute renal failure, CHF and other fluid disturbances. ANF is a testament to the incredible advances in peptide biology. Within 2 years of the discovery, ANF was sequenced and cloned. Since that time, literally thousands of papers describing its actions have been published. Our knowledge about this hormone grows at an exponential rate. It is clear that this hormone is intimately involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, vascular tone, and the pathophysiology of CHF but many questions remain unanswered. Continued research will provide many of the missing pieces to this very complex, new hormone system.\r"

  ".W": "The question of vascular tolerance was examined in 154 patients with acute myocardial infarction (64 anterior, 90 inferior) who were treated with prolonged low dose intravenous nitroglycerin in a recent randomized placebo-controlled study. The dose of nitroglycerin was carefully titrated to decrease mean blood pressure by 10% in normotensive patients and 30% in hypertensive (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) patients, but not less than 80 mm Hg. Tolerance was defined as the need to increase the dose to maintain this hemodynamic effect. It was labelled \"true\" if chest pain was absent and \"apparent\" if chest pain was present. Group analysis of dose, pain scores, hemodynamic, 2-dimensional echocardiographic and clinical parameters monitored serially before and after therapy indicated benefit with nitroglycerin over placebo despite equalizing of blood pressures after 10 hours. Reversal of blood pressures and volumes after discontinuing nitroglycerin suggested lack of significant tolerance. However, detailed individual analysis suggested significant hemodynamic tolerance in 37 patients (24%), both in the true tolerance (12%) and apparent tolerance (12%) subgroups. Tolerance appeared early, requiring the dose to be increased by 30 +/- 39 micrograms/min within 11 +/- 9 hours. The dose was greater (p less than 0.001) in the tolerance than in the no tolerance subgroup, both before (60 vs 27 micrograms/min) and after (90 vs 38 micrograms/min) 10 hours. Tolerance blunted the beneficial effect on infarct size, but positive effects on function, topography and complications persisted.\r"

Diastolic blood pressure was also reduced (p less than 0.05), and no change occurred in heart rate or forearm blood flow. Rilmenidine increased (p = 0.05) baroreflex sensitivity when blood pressure was increased with phenylephrine: no change in baroreflex sensitivity occurred during reduction in blood pressure with glyceryl trinitrate. Rilmenidine given at 1- and 2-mg doses reduced (p less than 0.05) systolic blood pressure during \"lying to standing,\" a test of autonomic function (76.3 +/- 9.8, 56.8 +/- 4.5 mmHg), versus results with placebo (95.2 +/- 10.5 mmHg); the R-R intervals associated with these blood pressure reductions were not different (571 +/- 12, 609 +/- 19 msec), versus results with placebo (541 +/- 28 msec). During \"sustained handgrip,\" rilmenidine given at 1- and 2-mg doses reduced (p less than 0.05) systolic blood pressure (146.8 +/- 6.2, 142.3 +/- 7.0 mmHg), versus results with placebo (157.3 +/- 7.5 mmHg); the corresponding R-R intervals were 705 +/- 45 and 675 +/- 49 msec, not different from those with placebo (695 +/- 49 msec). Similar results occurred with other tests of autonomic function (\"deep breathing\" and \"three-minute standing\"). In conclusion, rilmenidine increases baroreflex sensitivity to increases in blood pressure with phenylephrine; during tests of autonomic function, the lower blood pressures that occur with rilmenidine are associated with correspondingly greater R-R intervals; this may also indicate enhanced baroreflex sensitivity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if both the placenta and umbilical vessels are possible sites of atrial natriuretic peptide metabolism and to evaluate the effects that labor, route of delivery, prolonged pregnancy, preeclampsia, and fetal distress have on umbilical arterial atrial natriuretic peptide levels. We found that plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels in the umbilical artery are significantly greater than those in the vein (p less than 0.001). Umbilical arterial and umbilical venous atrial natriuretic peptide levels were higher in plasma samples collected immediately at delivery when compared with those obtained 10 minutes later (p less than 0.001). Umbilical arterial atrial natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and fetal distress (p less than 0.01). Labor, route of delivery, and prolonged pregnancy had no effect on umbilical arterial atrial natriuretic peptide levels. We propose that both the placenta and umbilical vessels contain atrial natriuretic peptide receptors that are involved in the clearance or metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide. The increased umbilical arterial atrial natriuretic peptide levels present in preeclampsia and fetal distress may reflect an attempt by the fetus to regulate blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred intrauterine exchange transfusions were performed under local anesthesia in 107 cases of blood incompatibilities (60 fetuses with severe anemia and 47 with hydrops). Under sonographic guidance, depending on fetal and placental position, an optimal puncturing site was selected along the umbilical vein: placental insertion, fetal insertion, or fetal intraabdominal segment. Tests were immediately performed to confirm fetal origin of blood obtained and estimate hemoglobin level. Blood used for exchange transfusion was compatible with maternal blood and had a hematocrit value of 75%. Exchange transfusion was continued until a hemoglobin level of 16 gm/dl was reached. This procedure was first associated with intraperitoneal transfusions and was subsequently used independently once a month to maintain an adequate hemoglobin level. In 4 fetuses with hydrops, antenatal regression of this sign was observed in 33 cases (70.2%). Overall outcome of 107 fetuses after exchanges was 84 living neonates (78.5%), 15 deaths in utero, and eight neonatal deaths. The survival rate was 91.6% for fetuses without hydrops and 61.7% for those with hydrops. The advantage of exchange transfusion appears to be rapid and efficient correction of anemia with elimination of incompatible fetal red blood cells.\r"

Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms' tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.\r"

  ".W": "The development of irreversible myocardial ischemic injury is associated with progressive degradation of membrane phospholipids, accumulation of arachidonate and other free fatty acids, and electrolyte derangements, including calcium accumulation. To study the relationship between arachidonate release and calcium loading during adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in cardiac myocytes, the effects of two purported phospholipase inhibitors, mepacrine and U26,384, were evaluated. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were pretreated for 90 minutes with 5 to 10 microM U26,384 (a steroidal diamine) or 10 to 50 microM mepacrine (an alkyl acridine) and then treated for 3 hours with 30 microM of the metabolic inhibitor, iodoacetic acid (IAA), with or without an additional dose of drug. IAA treatment resulted in a marked reduction in ATP level and a several-fold increase in free fatty acid radioactivity released from myocytes prelabeled with tritiated arachidonic acid (3H-AA). U26,384 produced substantial inhibition of the increased 3H-AA release, and was effective when given as a single pretreatment dose before IAA exposure or as continuous treatment before and during IAA exposure (for example, with 5 microM U26,384, the percentage of 3H-AA release versus IAA alone was 8% +/- 2% [SEM] [N = 15] for pretreatment only and 13% +/- 4% [N = 10] for continuous treatment). Mepacrine also resulted in significant reduction in 3H-AA release, but was more effective when given as continuous treatment (for example, with 50 microM mepacrine, the percentage of 3H-AA release versus IAA alone was 43% +/- 9% [N = 6] for pretreatment only and 22% +/- 7% [N = 9] for continuous treatment). More detailed analysis showed that U26,384 and mepacrine blocked the IAA-induced redistribution of 3H-AA into free fatty acids from other lipid species. Electron probe x-ray microanalysis of freeze-dried cryosections revealed marked electrolyte derangements in myocytes exposed to IAA, including a 24-fold increase in cellular Ca, a four fold increase in cellular Na, and a seven fold decrease in cellular K, and associated changes in cytoplasm and mitochondria. U26,384 treatment markedly reduced these electrolyte abnormalities, and maintained normal Ca levels in some protocols. Mepacrine treatment was less effective, but did produce normal Ca levels in 50% of myocytes. Prevention of IAA-induced cellular hypercontraction and blebbing also was observed. These data support the hypothesis that reduction of free fatty acid accumulation by inhibition of accelerated phospholipid degradation is associated with protection of myocytes from calcium loading and morphologic damage during inhibition of ene\r"

Immunoperoxidase studies on frozen and paraffin sections showed that all cases clearly exhibited immunoglobulin light chain restriction (eight cases kappa, six cases lambda). Southern blotting using JH, Ck, and Cl probes to detect clonally rearranged gene fragments confirmed monoclonality in each case, and the immunohistochemical and genotypic data were in agreement in all cases except one (1 light chain restriction/k gene rearrangement). The study confirmed that light chain restriction in gastric lymphoid infiltrates is synonymous with monoclonality ant there is a histologic continuum between low grade B cell gastric lymphoma with features of pseudolymphoma and high grade B cell lymphoma. The authors believe that histologic and immunohistochemical features such as light chain restriction clearly discriminate reactive and neoplastic gastric lymphoid infiltration. Therefore, light chain-restricted lymphoid proliferation, previously termed pseudolymphoma is, in fact, an early stage of frank lymphoma, which obviates the need to use the term pseudolymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possible inhibitory effects of terfenadine, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, and flurbiprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, on the bronchoconstrictor effect of inhaled 3.6% hypertonic saline in a randomized, double-blind study. Nine mildly asthmatic subjects with a history of exercise-induced asthma took part. This was conducted, first as a dose-response study and, second, as a time-course study. In the dose-response study, the provocative dose of saline-laden air causing a 25% fall in FEV1 was calculated (PD25). Terfenadine (180 mg) and the combination of terfenadine (180 mg) plus flurbiprofen (100 mg) both protected significantly against hypertonic saline challenge, achieving increases in PD25 values by factors of 7.24 and 6.30, respectively. Flurbiprofen (100 mg) also displaced the dose-response to the right, increasing the PD25 by a factor of 1.92, but this protection was significantly less than that afforded by terfenadine. In the time-course studies, a single inhalation of hypertonic saline previously shown to cause at least a 25% fall in FEV1 was administered, and FEV1, was followed for 30 min. Preadministration of terfenadine reduced the mean area under the curve of percentage fall in FEV1-time response by 68.5%, with similar results obtained with the combination of terfenadine and flurbiprofen. We conclude that the bronchoconstriction in asthma provoked by inhaled hypertonic saline is mediated predominantly through the hyperosmolar release of histamine from airway mast cells, with a minor contribution being made by prostanoids.\r"

We compared these results against those obtained with cultures of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and Mycobacterium kansasii. All BACTEC bottles were inoculated with known concentrations of organisms. TB antigen was detected by ELISA in BACTEC culture bottles of TB 12 days before the BACTEC system could itself identify the species. A growth index of greater than or equal to 10 reliably indicated that tuberculosis antigen was detectable by ELISA. The correlation between growth index and antigen concentration was extremely high (r = 0.95 and p less than 0.001). There was insignificant cross-reactivity with the other atypical mycobacteria at the levels of growth tested. This technique potentially offers a sensitive and specific means for the early identification of TB in BACTEC culture bottles.\r"

  ".W": "This study utilized computerized tomography (CT) to evaluate the effects of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) on upper airway (UA) dimensions. The objectives were to determine whether CT scan results would be useful in identifying UA characteristics predictive of a good surgical result as well as elucidating reasons for failure of this operative procedure. Twenty-three male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had CT scans and polysomnography performed before and after UPPP. Preoperatively, the apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI) was 64 +/- 6 per hour and the minimal UA cross-sectional area (Amin) was located at 10 and 20 mm below the level of the hard palate in 87% (20 of 23) of the patients. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty more than doubled UA cross-sectional areas at these two proximal levels. In contrast, the hypopharyngeal segment located 50 to 70 mm below the hard palate decreased in cross-sectional area by 23 to 25% after surgery. Eight patients (35%) had a good response to UPPP based on a greater than 50% decrease in AHI. Preoperatively, seven of these eight patients had Amin located 20 mm below the hard palate. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty increased Amin and oropharyngeal cross-sectional areas to a greater extent in the good than in the poor responders. A poor response to UPPP was associated with preoperative Amin greater than 1 cm2, location at site other than 20 mm below the hard palate, and postoperative narrowing at the level of the hard palate. Patients with Amin less than 1.0 cm2 located 20 mm below the hard palate (lower velopharynx) were most likely to obtain a favorable result with surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocyte infiltration of central airway epithelium was evaluated in 13 normal nonsmoking subjects (Group 1), in 11 smokers without clinical signs of chronic bronchitis (Group 2), and in 34 patients who were smokers with chronic bronchitis and mild airflow limitation (Group 3). Bronchial samples were obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against cell-surface antigens and an immunoperoxidase technique were used on cryostat sections to label in situ the following lymphocyte populations: T-lymphocytes (CD3+), helper/inducer T-cells (CD4+), suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+) and B-lymphocytes (leu 12+). Virtually no B-cells were found in central airway epithelium from subjects of any group. Conversely, consistent infiltration of epithelial layers with T-lymphocytes of both subsets was observed in all subjects, with a constant predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ cells. For any T-cell marker, differences between mean scores from Group 1 and Group 2 subjects were not statistically significant. On the other hand, mean lymphocyte numbers of both subsets were found increased in patients from Group 3 compared with subjects from the two other groups: statistically significant differences were observed for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, lymphocyte scores at two different airway generation were compared in some patients from Groups 2 and 3, and a significant positive correlation was observed. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte infiltration of central airway epithelium (1) may be a naturally occurring phenomenon that is amplified in the airways of smokers with chronic bronchitis, and (2) may represent the counterpart to the intraepithelial population of the intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of T-lymphocytes is accompanied by the release of interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) in a soluble form that can be measured as an index of the activation process. We performed a prospective, blinded study of the dynamic changes in soluble IL-2R levels in serum in 12 patients undergoing lung or heart-lung transplantation. The levels of soluble IL-2R were markedly elevated during episodes of rejection (geometric mean value X divided by SEM = 3,770 X divided by 1.06 versus 411 X divided by 1.08 U/ml for normal controls, p less than 0.0001). Levels of soluble IL-2R were 2,105 X divided by 1.16 U/ml with rejection episodes in single lung recipients versus 5,560 X divided by 1.30 in recipients of two lungs (p = 0.005). Soluble IL-2R levels were 1,468 X divided by 1.05 during episodes of nonbacterial infections, 1,879 X divided by 1.34 with bacterial infections, and 5,056 X divided by 1.08 with sepsis (p less than 0.001 for each category compared to normals). Levels of soluble IL-2R exceeded 6,750 U/ml only with rejection episodes and were greater than 4,100 U/ml either with rejection, clinical sepsis, or overwhelming bacterial infection. We conclude that marked elevations of soluble IL-2R are associated with rejection, intermediate elevations with either rejection or infection, and that low levels of soluble IL-2R exclude rejection.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid test was developed for determining the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid by using nucleic acid hybridization. The method was based on quantification of total mycobacterial rRNA hybridized to a 125I-labeled DNA probe in the absence and presence of various concentrations of isoniazid. The radioactive hybridized complex was isolated by adsorption to hydroxyapatite crystals and measured in a gamma counter. The susceptibilities of four reference strains and 20 clinical isolates were compared by the Gen-Probe DNA Hybridization System and the critical concentration method. Overall agreement between the two methods was excellent. Results were obtained with the DNA probe after 3 to 5 days of incubation instead of the 14 to 21 days required for the critical concentration method. These findings indicate that susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis by nucleic acid hybridization has merit for the clinical laboratory. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy of the DNA probe method for determining the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to other antimycobacterial agents and its correlation with clinically significant levels of resistance.\r"

Ampicillin-sulbactam combinations, vancomycin, daptomycin, and imipenem each reduced residual bacterial titers within vegetations to 4.01 log10 CFU/g or less; in 26 to 43% of animals receiving 5 days of therapy, titers of bacteria were reduced to undetectable levels. In a separate experiment, rats received ampicillin-sulbactam, daptomycin, or vancomycin for 10 days and were then observed for 10 days after termination of therapy for evidence of relapse. In surviving rats, valves remained sterile in four of five rats treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, in five of seven treated with daptomycin, but in only one of eight receiving vancomycin.\r"

We now report that certain 6-O-methyl-11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives of erythromycin are able to bind to dimethylated MLS-resistant 50S ribosomal subunits, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and cell growth. One of these novel structures, an 11-deoxy-11-(carboxyamino)-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11,12-(cyclic ester) derivative, structure 1a, was studied in detail. It inhibited in vitro protein synthesis in extracts prepared from both susceptible and MLS-resistant Bacillus subtilis with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.4 and 20 microM, respectively. The derivative bound specifically to a single site on the 50S subunit of MLS-resistant ribosomes prepared from B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and no binding to 30S subunits was observed. The association rate constant of derivative 1a with sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 100- and 500-fold slower, respectively, than that of the parent compound, erythromycin, with sensitive ribosomes. The dissociation rate constant of 1a from sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 50- to 100-fold slower than the rate of erythromycin dissociation from sensitive ribosomes. Furthermore, 1a binding to sensitive 50S subunits led to induction of ermC and ermD, while binding to resistant 50S subunits did not, showing that perturbation of sensitive and resistant 50S subunit function by 1a differs. These data demonstrated that 1a is unique in its interaction with MLS-resistant ribosomes and that this interaction causes a novel allosteric perturbation of ribosome function.\r"

Vital Record and Cancer Registry data, medical records, and mail questionnaires were used to assess mortality, symptomatology, cancer incidence, and reproductive events through 1984. The numbers of deaths, cancers, fetal deaths, and infants with low birth weight or congenital malformations were similar to those expected on the basis of age- and sex-specific rates for upstate New York and other comparison populations. Two suicides were observed compared with 0.31 expected, but the difference was not statistically significant. After adjustment for possible confounders, persons with the greatest degree of potential exposure were significantly more likely than those with less exposure to report unexplained weight loss (relative risk [RR] = 12.80), muscle pain (RR = 5.07), frequent coughing (RR = 4.14), skin color changes (RR = 3.49), and nervousness or sleep problems (RR = 3.19). The possibility of recall bias and the intervening effects of stress, however, weaken the conclusion that toxic chemicals caused the symptomatology. Exposure-related systemic disorders, e.g., chloracne or peripheral neuropathy, were not diagnosed by personal physicians; however, some persons refused to release their medical records because of ongoing litigation. The findings are consistent with those of our earlier assessment.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of dopamine, which has an inotropic effect on the myocardium and increases renal and splanchnic blood flow, on diaphragmatic contraction. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We studied the changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure during electrical bilateral supramaximal stimulation of the phrenic nerves in eight patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during acute respiratory failure. In three patients, changes in diaphragmatic blood flow were also evaluated. METHODS: All patients were intubated and artificially ventilated. Stimulated transdiaphragmatic pressure, cardiac output, evaluated with a Swan Ganz catheter, and diaphragmatic blood flow, evaluated by timed volume collections of left phrenic venous effluent (a catheter was introduced into the right femoral vein and advanced into the left inferior phrenic vein) were measured before dopamine infusion, every 10 minutes after the onset of dopamine infusion (10 micrograms/kg body weight.min during 30 minutes) and 15 minutes after the end of dopamine infusion. Arterial blood gases and pH were measured before and at the end of dopamine infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial blood gases and pH were maintained within normal range by mechanical ventilation throughout the study. With dopamine infusion, heart rate increased by 17% (P less than 0.001) and cardiac output by 40% (P less than 0.001) on the average. The increase in cardiac output was accompanied by a marked increase in diaphragmatic blood flow (30% on the average) in the three patients in whom it was measured (P less than 0.001). Diaphragmatic strength also increased significantly during dopamine administration. Transdiaphragmatic pressure for an identical phrenic stimulation increased by 30% (P less than 0.001) on the average. The changes in cardiac output, diaphragmatic blood flow, and transdiaphragmatic pressure persisted throughout the infusion period; all values returned to control values 15 minutes after the end of dopamine administration. CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine has a potent effect on diaphragmatic strength generation and diaphragmatic blood flow in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during acute respiratory failure. It is possible to improve diaphragmatic contraction in these patients by administering pharmacologic agents that augment diaphragmatic blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the attributable mortality and the excess length of hospital stay resulting from coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. DESIGN: Matched historical cohort study. SETTING: Large university-based tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Of 171 patients with hospital-acquired coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia identified by prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections from 1 July 1984 to 30 June 1987, 118 met criteria for the study and were matched to a control patient by age, sex, primary diagnoses, operative procedures, and date of admission. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Success was achieved in 621 of 650 (96%) variables used for matching. Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 92% of the bacteremias. Twenty cases (17%) had evidence of septic shock, and 10 had disseminated intravascular coagulation. The mortality rate in cases was 36 of 118 (30.5%) compared with 20 of 118 (16.9%) in controls. The attributable mortality was 13.6% (95% CI, 4.2 to 22.9) and the risk ratio for dying was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.7; P = 0.006). The median length of stay was 46 days for cases and 37.5 for controls (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci, the leading organisms causing hospital-acquired bacteremias, are associated with mortality in excess of that due to the underlying diseases alone. Moreover, they significantly prolong the length of hospital stay. These findings show the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia in hospitalized patients.\r"

Measurement of in vitro production of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase following overnight incubation of lymphocytes with exogenous interferon was used to assess functional capacity of the lymphocyte interferon system. In acute hepatitis patients, an early but transient elevation of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase was observed; the mean level at 1 week was significantly greater than the mean level at 4 weeks after the onset of their illness (p less than 0.01). Serial 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase levels did not identify those patients who were to progress to chronic hepatitis. Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, regardless of background liver histology, generally had normal basal lymphocyte 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase levels. In both acute viral hepatitis and chronic hepatitis B, there was an inverse correlation between basal 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase level and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase response to overnight incubation with interferon, a finding that suggested a transient down-regulation of interferon responsiveness. These findings provided no support for the hypothesis that there is an inherent or persistently induced deficiency in the interferon system in acute or chronic hepatitis B.\r"

All had CPSE with progressive, severe cerebral impairment refractory to clinical treatment. Four patients had a spontaneous splenorenal shunt, and one had a surgically created mesocaval shunt (MCS). Partial splenic embolization was performed in two patients, direct shunt embolization was performed via percutaneous transhepatic portography in two other patients, and an MCS embolization was performed in one patient through the inferior vena cava. In four patients embolization controlled the CPSE. In the remaining patient it could not be evaluated because of his premature death from intraabdominal bleeding, a late complication of the procedure. Interventional radiologic procedures are effective in the control of CPSE in selected patients.\r"

Differentiation of acinar domains in liver tissue was made possible by carrying out succinate dehydrogenase histochemical reactions on liver cryostat sections. To determine the position of hemopoietic foci within the lobular gradient of the hepatocyte succinate dehydrogenase activity, this enzyme was measured in hepatocytes surrounding both portal and central veins and hemopoietic foci. Then, assuming the periportal succinate dehydrogenase activity value to be 1.00 +/- 0.2, succinate dehydrogenase activity around postnatal hemopoietic foci was 0.65 +/- 0.19, around phenylhydrazine-induced hemopoietic foci 0.83 +/- 0.24 and around central veins 0.44 +/- 0.11. Scaling the portal to central vein distance and taking 1 as the portal vein point and 0 as the central vein point, the relative position of hemopoietic foci, indirectly calculated from succinate dehydrogenase activity values, was 0.35 +/- 0.13 in postnatal livers and 0.73 +/- 0.12 in phenylhydrazine-treated adult livers. Hemopoietic foci frequencies varied according to both the origin and the liver acinar domain: in postnatal liver acini, it was 37.1% in zone 1, 22.8% in zone 2 and 40% in zone 3; in phenylhydrazine-treated adult acini, it was 89.4% in zone 1 and 10.6% in zone 2. Postnatal hemopoietic foci mainly occurred extrasinusoidally, between hepatocytes and reticular-like cells, whereas adult hemopoietic foci were mostly intrasinusoidal and closely associated to macrophage-like cells.

Previous work, using bovine brain tubulin as a model protein, has shown that acetaldehyde preferentially formed stable adducts on the alpha-chain of the heterodimeric molecule. This binding resulted in functional impairment of the tubulin/microtubule system as evidenced by a decreased ability of adducted tubulin to form microtubules. Since tubulin/microtubules are believed to be very important cytoskeletal components of the hepatocyte and results with brain tubulin were interesting, our goal was to extend these studies to liver tubulin. We purified tubulin from rat liver by a polymerization-based cycle method followed by phosphocellulose chromatography. We then characterized the covalent binding of [14C]acetaldehyde to liver tubulin. Naturally forming and cyanoborohydride-stimulated stable adducts formed linearly with liver tubulin in a manner almost identical to that with brain tubulin. We also found that the alpha-chain of the native heterodimeric liver tubulin molecule was the preferred site of adduct formation at low acetaldehyde to protein ratios. These results confirm and extend our previous findings with the brain tubulin model and further suggest that the alpha-chain of tubulin may be a preferential site for acetaldehyde-adduct formation during ethanol oxidation in the liver.\r"

The biochemical identification of the antigens, however, has remained elusive. We report herein that the 52 kD antigen is the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This was demonstrated by three experiments through the use of recombinant fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli from a cDNA insert encoding the human autoantigen. First, 33 of 37 primary biliary cirrhosis patients exhibiting reactivity toward the 50 to 52 kD mitochondrial antigen by immunoblotting also showed reactivity toward the recombinant fusion protein. Second, absorption of primary biliary cirrhosis sera with recombinant fusion protein, but not with an irrelevant recombinant clone, the F-specific rat liver antigen, was effective in absorbing out reactivity against the 50 to 52 kD mitochondrial antigen but not the 68 to 74 kD antigen. Third, complete removal of reactivity toward all four different isoelectric point polypeptides at 50 to 52 kD was observed in two-dimensional gel analysis. Furthermore, primary biliary cirrhosis sera were analyzed with mitochondria from three sources, rat liver, human placenta and bovine heart, in order to compare reactivity patterns and to determine precisely the comparative molecular weights of the autoantigens in the three species. The availability of recombinant autoantigens will provide improved diagnostic tests and, more importantly, will allow definite issues in primary biliary cirrhosis to be studied, including identification of immunodominant epitopes, the significance of autoantigen recognition and the establishment of autoreactive T cell clones.\r"

An inverted V-shape polyethylene cannula, either heparin bonded or silicon coated, was inserted into the portal vein and inferior vena cava to maintain venous return from the splanchnic and lower caval regions of the anhepatic rat. Blood glucose fell at a rate of 7 to 11 mg per hr per total plasma volume (4% body weight), usually resulting in hypoglycemia within the initial 2 hr. Euglycemia could be maintained in the first 3 hr after hepatectomy with hourly intravenous infusions of 2.5 to 5 mg per 100 gm body weight of glucose. Larger infusions of glucose (10 to 12.5 mg per hr per 100 gm body weight) were necessary for normal levels at later times. A 0.5 gm per 100 gm rat weight intestinal glucose bolus restored euglycemia for at least a 2-hr interval. Intestinal absorption of cholesterol and oleic acid was demonstrated in the anhepatic rat, although the latter was not so efficiently absorbed as in the control. The plasma cholesterol decreased with time in the anhepatic rat. Prompt increases were observed in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations after hepatectomy. Progressive increases in both direct and indirect plasma bilirubin levels were noted after hepatectomy. With appropriate maintenance of blood sugar, survival of 36 hr was observed. This procedure for single stage total hepatectomy in the rat can be performed in less than 30 min. The model is particularly useful for studies of the influence of the liver on postabsorptive metabolism.\r"

Seven patients with alcoholic cirrhosis received verapamil, 10 mg i.v., and, 60 min later, ketanserin, 5 mg i.v. Verapamil decreased heart rate and increased free hepatic venous pressure but had no effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient or azygos blood flow. When combined with verapamil, ketanserin significantly diminished wedged hepatic venous pressure and hepatic venous pressure gradient. Ten other patients with alcoholic cirrhosis received propranolol, 15 mg i.v., and 45 min later, ketanserin, 5 mg i.v. In all patients, heart rate, cardiac index and azygos blood flow significantly decreased after propranolol. After propranolol alone, however, wedged hepatic venous pressure decreased in only five patients, responders. In five other patients, defined as nonresponders, propranolol did not decrease this pressure. The addition of ketanserin to propranolol induced further significant reduction in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow. Among the five nonresponders, three had a reduced wedged hepatic venous pressure after ketanserin was combined. We conclude that verapamil does not reduce portal pressure or collateral blood flow in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The splanchnic hemodynamic effects of propranolol and ketanserin appear to be independent and additive, without significant systemic alteration.\r"

This 14.6% reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient resulted mainly from a decrease in mean wedged hepatic venous pressure (from 22.2 +/- 4.0 to 20.1 +/- 3.6 mmHg) and was accompanied by significant decreases in cardiac index (18.8%) and in mean arterial pressure (8.1%). However, changes in cardiac index or in mean arterial pressure were not predictive of modifications in the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Eight of 16 patients entered in the study developed side effects, the most significant being a reversible portosystemic encephalopathy, which occurred in three patients who had poor liver function. This study confirms evidence in favor of a role for 5-hydroxytryptamine in portal hypertension and adds a new group of agents for the chronic treatment of portal hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the demographic, clinical, laboratory and histologic features of 13 patients who were diagnosed as having polyarteritis nodosa associated with hepatitis B virus infection over a 12-year period, 1974 to 1985. All 13 patients were Yupik Eskimos and resided in southwest Alaska, an area hyperendemic for hepatitis B virus infection. The annual incidence of hepatitis B virus-associated polyarteritis nodosa for this population is 7.7 cases per 100,000 population. All patients presented with multisystem disease, and all had biopsy or angiographic findings consistent with polyarteritis nodosa. All 13 were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen at diagnosis. Two untreated patients and two of five patients who received corticosteroids died, vs. none of six who received corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide. None of the patients who survived the initial bout of polyarteritis nodosa has relapsed after a mean follow-up of 55 months, but all have become chronic HBsAg carriers. In eight patients, clinical or serologic evidence indicated that polyarteritis nodosa followed recent hepatitis B virus infection. We concluded that hepatitis B virus-associated polyarteritis nodosa is a serious, life-threatening complication that occurs early in the course of hepatitis B virus infection, is ameliorated by immunosuppressive therapy and can be prevented by hepatitis B vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "In 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD)-induced axonal neuropathy, the rate of neurofilament (NF) transport increases in optic axons. To test the prediction that increases in the rate of polymer transport in any one locality of the axon lead directly to a decrease in the number of NF in that locality, NF and microtubules (MT) were quantitatively analyzed in axonal cross sections. In 2,5-HD axons the number of NF was 38% of that in control axons while the number of MT was not significantly changed; it appears that the drug treatment decreases NF number in the proximal axon regions, most directly through an increase in rate of NF transport. In those regions, the cross-sectional areas of the 2,5-HD-treated axons were 45% smaller than those of control axons; although the axons had shrunk in diameter, they retained their normal cylindrical shapes as measured by the index of circularity. Reduced internal expansive forces in the axon, working in conjunction with the normal external compressive forces, appear to reduce the radius of the axon. Quantitative analyses demonstrated that the average and the maximum lateral spacings between NF-NF, NF-MT, and MT-MT were all 30% larger in 2,5-HD-treated axons than in control axons. This suggests that polymers are relatively free to move laterally away from one another and to fill the available space within the axon. These observations are not consistent with models wherein 2,5-HD acts to crosslink the NF into an immobile network that can no longer advance within the axon. Instead, it appears more likely that 2,5-HD acts selectively on the interaction between some NF and the slow transport mechanism to increase the rate of NF transport.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the morphological substrate of acute methotrexate (MTX) encephalopathy, light and electron microscopic studies were performed on rat brains after short-term intraperitoneal (IP) and intraventricular (IV) injections of MTX. In both models, Alzheimer type II astrocytosis was the initial and major pathologic alteration seen by light microscopy. The neurons, oligodendrocytes, myelin and endothelial cells were relatively spared. Ultrastructural studies showed pleomorphism and condensation of mitochondria, membrane-bound vacuoles, prominent stacks of sparsely granular, rough endoplasmic reticulum and progressive hydropic swelling of astrocytic perikarya and their processes. The astroglial alterations were reversible after cessation of the drug but persisted for a longer time with repeated IP administration. Gastrointestinal complications and overall mortality were also greater with higher doses and increasing frequency of IP MTX injection. White matter necrosis was noted only after IV injection of high-dose MTX. The neuropathologic changes of MTX leukoencephalopathy can be replicated in an animal model by IV injection of the drug. The reversibility of the changes that were seen following IP administration correlates with the transient neurologic deficits observed in some patients after high-dose systemic MTX therapy. The initially selective astroglial effect suggests that astrocytes might be a target for MTX toxicity, although other central nervous system components may also be adversely affected by the drug.\r"

Neither cerebral microvessel smooth muscle cells nor oligodendrocytes affected endothelial cell glucose uptake. The astrocytic product(s) did not affect glucose uptake by aortic endothelial cells. The effect on the cerebral microvessel endothelial cells increased with increasing time of exposure of the cells to the astroglial product(s), and required the constant presence of the astrocytic product to be maintained. The presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor during endothelial cell exposure to the astroglial conditioned medium blocked the stimulation of glucose uptake. Treatment of the astrocytic product with a protease destroyed its effectiveness. These results support the hypothesis that astrocytes induce the expression of at least one blood-brain barrier property by the cerebral microvasculature, and suggest that this induction may be produced by a protein released by the astrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Cryogenic injury of adult, rat spinal cord was produced under controlled non-invasive conditions to study repair and regeneration in adult, mammalian central nervous tissue in which tissue continuity and integrity are relatively preserved. Under these experimental conditions axons and myelin are destroyed, a matrix of glial cells is preserved, and regrowth of axons is apparent. Electron microscopic studies at 7, 15, 30 and 60 days post-injury demonstrate axonal structures indicative of regrowth, astrocytic structures which appear to provide support to both matrix and axons and myelination of axons by both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. These cellular events restore much of the normal structure within the injured area up to its junction with the Wallerian zone. In this junctional zone morphologic evidence may indicate continuing cellular activity, even at 60 days, in axons, astrocytes and myelinating cells. These studies suggest that under ideal conditions damaged axons may be capable of regeneration within the adult mammalian central nervous system and that this model provides an opportunity to define some of the mechanisms.\r"

Alcohol intake was also assessed at 10 and 20 years of follow-up and every 2 years thereafter. In analyses using only baseline alcohol intake, the multiple risk factor-adjusted relative risk (RR) estimate of breast cancer for any drinking, compared with nondrinking, was 0.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-1.1]. For three levels of alcohol intake (0.1-1.4 g/day, 1.5-4.9 g/day, and greater than or equal to 5.0 g/day), the baseline analyses yielded RRs (vs. nondrinking) of 1.0 (CI, 0.6-1.5), 0.7 (CI, 0.4-1.1), and 0.6 (CI, 0.4-1.0), respectively. In analyses incorporating repeated measures of alcohol, the comparable RRs were 0.9 (CI, 0.6-1.2) for any drinking (vs. nondrinking) and 0.7 (CI, 0.4-1.4), 1.1 (CI, 0.7-1.8), and 0.8 (CI, 0.5-1.2), respectively, for the three levels of intake (vs. nondrinking).

This concept was used to create a continent urinary reservoir in a 3-year-old former ischiopagus tripus conjoined twin. The solitary renal unit had been drained into a hydrocolpos with an antirefluxing ureteral reimplantation at separation. The patient remained incontinent through the urogenital sinus. At subsequent reconstruction the posterior aspect of the hydrocolpos was tubularized as a vagina, while the remainder of the hydrocolpos was augmented with ileum to create a urinary reservoir. The conduit was constructed with imbricated ileum, in which myectomy had been performed to allow for easier imbrication and tubularization for a narrow neourethra. A second set of conjoined twins have been separated similarly. Of these twins 1 will undergo creation of a continent urinary reservoir in an identical fashion. This represents the first report of the use of hydrocolpos in the creation of a urinary reservoir.\r"

Vesical pressure was significantly depressed after either baclofen (p less than 0.005) or morphine (p less than 0.005), while urethral pressure was decreased significantly only following baclofen (p less than 0.025). Administration of a baclofen/morphine admixture resulted in an additive reaction on the urethral pressure profile, compared with the changes brought about by each drug alone. Relaxation of the bladder and reduction in urethral resistance occurred 30 minutes post injection, increasing progressively after 60 and 90 minutes. The results demonstrated that baclofen, by its influence on cord neuron interaction, is capable of inhibiting the activity of the smooth muscle of the normal bladder and urethra, which in the case of the latter became more pronounced when both drugs were administered simultaneously by the intrathecal route.\r"

The method involves the intravesical instillation of xylene or its vehicle (0.3 cc of silicone oil) through a catheter chronically implanted into the rat bladder. The instillation of xylene (10 to 100%) produced behavioural effects (licking of lower abdomen or perineal region, hind paws hyperextension) suggestive of visceral pain. All the behavioural responses produced by xylene instillation were prevented by extrinsic bladder denervation (pelvic ganglionectomy). Morphine HCl (two to five mg./kg. s.c., 30 min. before) or (+/-)-baclofen (2.5-10 mg./kg. s.c., 60 min. before) reduced or abolished the response to xylene instillation, thus indicating that the action of analgesic drugs can be quantitated using the present model.\r"

We found that 26 per cent of 515 patients evaluated had residual urine after routine attempts were made to evacuate the bladder fully. We conclude that a single residual urine estimate may be inaccurate and one should not always base therapeutic decisions upon any single such measurement.\r"

These studies suggest that many of the functional and structural alterations following partial outlet obstruction may result from the initial overdistension which occurs within the first 24 hours. In these present studies, we investigated the time course of the effect of complete obstruction of the rabbit urinary bladder on the contractile response to bethanechol and field stimulation and on the muscarinic receptor density. Male White New Zealand rabbits were divided into five groups: controls, four, eight, 20, and 24 hours of complete obstruction. The results demonstrated that there was a significant decrease in both the contractile response to muscarinic stimulation and muscarinic receptor density at four hours following outlet obstruction (at a time when there was no bladder overdistension). The receptor density and contractile response to stimulation further decreased over the 24 hour period. These studies indicate that the initial decrease in muscarinic receptor density and contractile response to muscarinic stimulation may be mediated in part by the high level of spontaneous contractile activity induced by ligation of the urethra.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study we investigated the effects of age on the micturition characteristics and bladder function of male Fischer rats ages five to seven, 16 to 18 and 22 to 24 months. The 24 hr. water intake and urine output increases significantly with age; 22 to 24 month rats showed a 39% increase in water intake and a 93% increase in urine output compared to five to seven month rats. The intravesical pressure at micturition is 100% greater in 22 to 24 month and 16 to 18 month rats compared to five to seven month old rats with no age-related change in bladder volume at micturition. In the present study, in vitro bladder capacity did not differ between the three age groups although the average plateau pressure significantly decreased with advancing age. Using the isolated whole bladder model, the contractile response to the autonomic agonists bethanechol, phenylephrine, and isoproterenol did not change significantly with age. Similarly, there were no age-related changes in the response of the bladder to non-autonomic drugs (histamine, oxytocin, serotonin, substance P, and PGF2 alpha) except for PGF2 alpha which produced an age-related increase in the maximum bladder contraction. In summary, while in vivo micturition clearly changes with age, the in vitro contractility of the bladders to autonomic agents did not. Therefore, age related differences in micturition would be related primarily to the changes in neuronal innervation and central control of micturition rather than alterations in the contractility of the bladder. In addition, these studies show the importance of correlating in vivo bladder function (micturition frequency and volume, cystometry and urodynamics) with in vitro contractile and functional studies.\r"

The objectives were to characterize prostanoid receptors and, in particular, to elucidate whether more than one receptor was involved in prostanoid-induced contraction of penile erectile tissues. L-636,499 at concentrations 10(-6) M to 3 x 10(-5) M induced a parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve to U44069 in both corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum suggesting competitive antagonism. Schild plots using U44069 as the agonist and L-636,499 as the antagonist revealed slope indexes near unity in both tissues, and the pA2 values were almost identical. In contrast, L-636,499 concentration-dependently reduced the maximum response to prostaglandin F2 alpha, indicating a non-competitive action. The results suggest that the main contraction-mediating prostanoid receptor in human penile erectile tissues is a thromboxane A2 sensitive receptor. However, the presence of more than one contraction-mediating prostanoid receptor cannot be excluded.\r"

The purpose of this analysis was to identify prognostic variables predictive of tumor progression defined as muscle invasion, metastasis or endoscopically uncontrolled superficial bladder carcinoma involving the bladder and/or prostatic urethra. Variables examined before bacillus Calmette-Guerin, and at 3 and 6 months after bacillus Calmette-Guerin included age, sex, race, purified protein derivative reaction, duration of disease, tumor category, tumor grade, multifocality, results of cytology, flow cytometry, cystoscopy, biopsy, prior chemotherapy and bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment regimen. Significant variables (Cox regression analysis, p less than 0.07) for tumor progression were before bacillus Calmette-Guerin--stage T1 tumors and duration of disease less than 1 year, at 3 months after bacillus Calmette-Guerin--stage T1 tumor, duration of disease less than 1 year, positive cytology studies and multifocality, and at 6 months after bacillus Calmette-Guerin--stage T1 tumor, positive cytology and positive biopsy other than stage T1 tumors. Prognostic risk groups were best defined at 6 months after bacillus Calmette-Guerin, the probability of tumor progression thereafter being at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively, as follows: for risk group 1 (T1 tumor)--71, 100 and 100 per cent, for risk group 2 (positive biopsy other than T1 plus positive cytology)--25, 79 and 100 per cent, for risk group 3 (either positive biopsy other than stage T1 or positive cytology studies)--18, 40 and greater than 81 per cent, and for risk group 4 (negative biopsy and negative cytology studies)--2, 11 and 26 per cent, respectively. Evaluation of patients with superficial bladder carcinoma at 6 months after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy identifies the probability of tumor progression. Patients at high risk for tumor progression require alternative treatment strategies, whereas low risk patients can be observed for further therapy if necessary.\r"

Of the 17 patients with a survival free of disease of less than 100 weeks 16 died of recurrent urothelial tumors and 1 died of a second primary tumor. Among the patients with a survival free of disease of longer than 100 weeks only 2 have had recurrent urothelial tumors; 72 per cent of the patients in this category remain free of disease. Patients with pure transitional cell carcinoma were represented in equal frequency among patients achieving a durable complete remission and those with a complete remission of less than 100 weeks. These data demonstrate the ability of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin combination chemotherapy to achieve a complete remission and long-term survival free of disease among select patients with unresectable urothelial tumors.\r"
