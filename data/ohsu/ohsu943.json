  ".W": "A chromium-sensitized, and thulium and holmium-doped YAG laser (THC:YAG laser) was used to create bilateral limbal sclerostomies in six Dutch pigmented rabbits. The laser is a long-pulsed (300 microseconds) [corrected], compact, self-contained, solid-state laser operating in the near infrared (2.1 microns). A 1-mm conjunctival stab incision was made 12 mm away from the sclerostomy site to allow entry of a specially designed 26-gauge (480 microns) optic probe that delivers energy at right angles to the long axis of the fiber. Probe insertion minimally disturbed the conjunctiva. Pulse energies of 60 to 150 mJ were used with a repetition rate of 5 pulses/s. Energy levels ranging from 1.35 to 6.6 J produced full-thickness sclerostomies. Histopathology showed a sharply defined perforating limbal wound at all energy levels. The overlying conjunctiva was intact, with swelling of the adjacent cornea. A peripheral iridectomy was intentionally created with the laser through the peripheral limbus, resulting in a sharply defined perforating tract through the iris/ciliary body. This technique may simplify filtering sclerostomy surgery, without anterior chamber instrumentation and with minimal conjunctival trauma.\r"

In spite of this, it had been possible for the perimetrist to influence the results of perimeter measurements. The introduction of computer-controlled perimetry, however, has largely eliminated the influence of the investigator on perimetry results. Nevertheless, the interpretation of a perimetric result in the everyday clinical situation is still extensively subjectively coloured and is liable to vary, depending on the doctor carrying it out. The OCTOPUS Program G1 was introduced a few years ago and used above all for glaucoma. This program greatly simplified visual field assessment thanks to its visual field indices. The indices make it possible to compare visual field results with those of a normal population. The present introduction of the OCTOSMART program represents a further step forward. This program analyses measured visual fields with the aid of standardized, statistical criteria based on a large, normal value study. This analysis standardizes and thereby simplifies the interpretation of visual field results. This study compares the outcome of the OCTOSMART program with visual field interpretations by eye doctors.\r"

Its purpose is to investigate the alterations in the central 15 degrees and 30 degrees of the visual field and in each quadrant separately. In both groups A and B, PRP covered the periphery and mid-periphery. In group A, it stopped 2 disc diameters (DD) from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea including the papillomacular bundle, while in group B, PRP stopped 3 DD from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea and 1 DD of the nasal margin of the optic disc. The investigation revealed, in group B after PRP, an improvement of the retinal sensitivity in the central 15 degrees of the visual field (p less than 0.01). In the 30 degrees of the visual field a deterioration after PRP was noted in both groups A and B, the deterioration being however much more prominent in group A. Comparing the results between groups B and A after PRP, a difference in the retinal sensitivity in favour of group B at 15 degrees and 30 degrees of the visual field was found. As regards regression of neovascularization and visual acuity, no statistically significant difference has been observed between the two groups.\r"

The technique of ocular hypotension prior to gas injection varied according to the characteristics of each case, using vitrectomy and SF6 30% in 8 cases (group 1), fluid-gas (SF6) exchange through the pars plana in 10 cases (group 2), paracentesis of the anterior chamber prior to injection of SF6 in 12 cases (group 3) and injection of C3F8 without drainage in 13 cases (group 4). Retinal reattachment was initially achieved in 87 (group 1), 83.3 (group 2), 100 (group 3) and 92.3% (group 4), but 4 recurrences yielded a 6-month follow-up cure of 75 (group 1), 75 (group 2), 91 (group 3) and 84% (group 4). Postoperative complications included proliferative vitreoretinopathy (7%), endophthalmitis (2.3%) and subretinal hemorrhage (2.3%). The use of intraocular gas tamponade appears to be a procedure with an acceptable complication rate in the treatment of retinal detachment due to macular hole. This study suggests the use of paracentesis and SF6 in phakic eyes, C3F8 in aphakic eyes and vitrectomy plus 30% SF6 in eyes with proliferative vitreoretinopathy or vitreoretinal traction adjacent to the macular hole.\r"

The MSCH developed late in the procedure following PPV, air fluid exchange, endolaser, cryopexy, and scleral buckling in five of seven eyes. In two eyes, mild hemorrhagic choroidal detachments noted intraoperatively progressed to MSCH within 72 hours postoperatively. Diagnosis of MSCH was confirmed by echography and CT scan. Multiple scleral buckling surgeries, high myopia, aphakia, and intraocular inflammation were the main risk factors. Placement of a broad posterior scleral buckle with intraoperative hypotony and cryopexy were important precipitating factors. Visual results were poor, with six of seven eyes showing no light perception. The mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Once acute MSCH is recognized intraoperatively, surgical decompression at that time should be avoided as MSCH itself may tamponade the choroidal bleed. Details of prevention and management are discussed.\r"

Later, peripheral retinal scarring and pigmentation, peripheral arteriolar closure, and neovascularization of the peripheral retina at the ora serrata or occasionally neovascularization of the optic disc develop. Cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma can cause profound visual loss. Vitrectomy reduces traction on the retina and allows for retinal reattachment. The role of argon laser photocoagulation or cryopexy in reducing the neovascular complications remains uncertain.\r"

In the United States, no firm association between HLA-A or -B loci and VKH has been found previously; testing for HLA-DR loci has not been performed to date. The authors performed HLA typing of 23 American patients with VKH and 8 patients with SO. When VKH patients were compared with racially matched controls without disease and patients with other types of uveitis, strong associations with HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRw53 were found. The strongest associations observed in this sample were with HLA-DQw3, an antigen which is in positive linkage disequilibrium with DR4, and with the HLA-DR4/DQw3 haplotype. The small number of patients with SO precluded statistical analysis; however, similar HLA associations were noted. The patients also were questioned regarding their ancestry. The anecdotal association of VKH with American Indian ancestry was confirmed. It appears that the ethnoracial association may be explained by HLA type. One possible explanation for identical HLA associations in two diseases with different precipitating events yet similar ocular manifestations is development of an altered immune response to exogenous microbial antigen with subsequent autoimmunity. Further definition of the genetic susceptibility to VKH and SO may help define the pathophysiology of both diseases and allow the prediction of which patients are at increased risk for SO.\r"

The majority of ophthalmic malignancies were included within three histologic groupings: melanomas (70.4%), retinoblastomas (9.8%), and squamous cell carcinomas (9.2%). The average annual incidence of retinoblastoma among persons in NYS who were less than 5 years of age was 9.5 per 1,000,000 for boys and 8.7 per 1,000,000 for girls (male:female rate ratio, 1.09). The average annual incidence (age-adjusted) of ocular melanomas was 4.9 per 1,000,000 among men and 3.7 per 1,000,000 among women in NYS (male:female rate ratio, 1.32). Expanded knowledge of the epidemiology of ophthalmic cancers can help to develop a foundation on which to monitor disease patterns and can serve to stimulate further etiologic research involving these rare malignancies.\r"

Most patients with late-onset Krabbe's disease present with visual loss due to optic atrophy. Associated gait abnormalities and parental consanguinity should increase the clinician's suspicion that a child may have late-onset Krabbe's disease.

On transmission electron microscopy, the crystals were surrounded by a membrane sometimes consisting of up to 30 concentric layers. The crystals were found to contain carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and disulfide bonds. The findings suggest that a major constituent of the crystals was a sulfur-containing aminoacid, probably cystine. Protein analysis of the remaining lens material showed elevated alpha-, beta 2-, and gamma 2- crystallin levels.

Light and electron microscopic studies of the lesions in both patients were similar and disclosed stromal nodules composed of proliferating myofibroblasts, activated fibroblasts, and haphazardly arranged fascicles of collagen. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the spindle cells within the nodules expressed immunoreactivity for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin.

To test this hypothesis, we studied the cornea, serum, and nasal cartilage from an MCD patient using light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which uses a monoclonal antibody against a sulfated epitope on the KS chain to measure KS content. Histologically, corneal deposits seen were characteristic of MCD. No abnormal deposits were noted in the cartilage. The lack of immunoreactivity in corneal sections with antibodies against sulfated epitope on KS and the absence of this epitope in serum showed that the patient had type 1 MCD. The cartilage specimen showed no immunoreactivity in the chondrocytes or extracellular matrix. Quantitative analysis by ELISA demonstrated that the antigenic KS content of the cornea and cartilage was at least 800 times lower than that in normal controls. This provided direct evidence that the abnormality in the sulfation of keratan in type 1 MCD involves the cornea and cartilage.\r"

The shields delivered significantly more fluorescein to the aqueous humor at 2 and 4 hours compared with drops of the same concentration instilled every 30 minutes for 4 hours (P less than 0.0001 and P = 0.0003, respectively) or daily wear soft contact lenses presoaked in 0.01% fluorescein (P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.0025, respectively). Collagen shields did not induce damage to the corneal epithelium over a 2-hour wearing period. These results suggest that the collagen shield may be superior to topical drops in delivering water-soluble compounds to the cornea and aqueous humor.\r"

Fifteen eyes of nine patients with increased intraocular pressure and glaucomatous visual field loss but low cup-to-disc ratios are reported. The optic disc area was significantly (P less than 0.01) smaller than in 429 normal subjects and 556 glaucoma patients with high cup-to-disc ratios. Parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy was significantly larger and retinal nerve fiber bundles were significantly less visible than in the normal group. The latter two parameters were not significantly different in the glaucoma groups with low and high cup-to-disc ratios when the groups were matched for mean perimetric loss. The authors conclude that in eyes with small optic discs, glaucomatous optic nerve damage may be indicated more sensitively by parapapillary changes than by cup-to-disc ratios. Glaucomatous eyes with small optic nerve heads can have misleadingly low cup-to-disc ratios.\r"

Small cells were found on both lens types, but in a higher frequency on the control lenses. The number of small cells decreased during the first 4 weeks on both the control and HSM lenses. However, those control lenses that had giant cells on their surface showed an increase in the number of small cells during the same time.

The range of thermal necrosis in different tissue types is probably based on the water content within each type. A cellular partially homogenized zone of reversible thermal damage up to 500 microns in width was visible adjacent to the zone of thermal necrosis. The relatively narrow width of tissue necrosis with this technique may account for the claimed superior properties of laser-induced wounds compared with those created by electrosurgery.\r"

Dental therapy consisted of preventive, restorative, and surgical procedures, with extractions and stainless steel crowns being the most common treatment modalities. There were no serious postoperative complications, and no airway problems were experienced. Although extensive intraoral mucosal blistering did occur in several cases, postoperative healing progressed normally. Soft tissue trauma may be lessened through the use of small suction tips, flat tissue retractors, and extensive lubrication of all tissues requiring manipulation. This study provides further evidence that even the most severely affected patients with epidermolysis bullosa can receive comprehensive dental treatment directed at maintaining a functional dentition.\r"

The hospital records of 112 patients with SLE were reviewed and screened for endocarditis, heart murmurs, and other valvular pathosis. Two of the 112 patients had confirmed cases of bacterial endocarditis. This prevalence is comparable to endocarditis prevalence rates in patients with prosthetic valves and is also three times that in patients with rheumatic heart disease. The high prevalence of endocarditis in this population of patients with SLE suggests that according to present perspectives on patient management, patients with SLE should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental therapies associated with formation of a bacteremia.\r"

In tubular and trabecular types the outer cells consistently displayed an intense staining for vimentin and some were also positive for actin, indicating their myoepithelial nature. In the solid type, most tumor cells resembled the ductal cells or basal cells of larger ducts in normal gland with regard to their immunoreactivity.

Biopsy of the maxillary gingiva demonstrated sheets of histiocytes containing small intracellular yeasts, which on culture were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum. Bilateral leukoplakic lesions with some vertical furrowing involving the lateral borders of the tongue were also noted. Histologically, hyperkeratosis and fungal hyphae were identified. The patient was treated for histoplasmosis with amphotericin B, which resulted in significant improvement of the oral lesions. He was subsequently hospitalized for fatigue and dyspnea and was found to have Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Pulmonary status deteriorated within a 3-week period, and the patient died. Autopsy findings were negative for histoplasmosis but positive for necrotizing and cavitary P. carinii pneumonia, pulmonary and hepatic herpes simplex infections, and pulmonary and intestinal cytomegalovirus infection.\r"

Nineteen of the 27 permanent teeth were functioning for 7 months to 6 years and 7 months postoperatively. Root resorption was the cause of tooth loss in five cases. The incidence of root resorption seemed to increase with the increase of the extraoral period, but it was not affected by the period between avulsion and replantation, the condition of supporting tissues, the degree of root formation, and the type and period of splinting, indicating multiple factors involved in determining the prognosis of replanted teeth. In conclusion, every effort should be made to preserve avulsed teeth even in unfavorable conditions.\r"

The scanner-based system was equivalent to the video-based system in recording radiographic film densities and had more geometric distortion than the video-based system.

Meta-analysis revealed substantial, but very similar improvements have been obtained with propranolol and with relaxation/biofeedback training. When daily recordings have been used to assess treatment outcome, both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have yielded a 43% reduction in migraine headache activity in the average patient. When improvements have been assessed using other outcome measures (e.g., physician/therapist ratings), improvements observed with each treatment have been about 20% greater. In both cases, improvements observed with propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have been significantly larger than improvement observed with placebo medication (14% reduction) or in untreated patients (no reduction). Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial empirical support for the effectiveness of both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback training, but revealed no support for the contention that the two treatments differ in effectiveness. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to determining the relative costs and benefits of widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.\r"

  ".U": "91044448\r", 
  ".W": "In experiment 1, quantitative regional comparisons of the antinociceptive and cardiovascular responses produced by electrical stimulation in the caudal medulla, including regions such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), nucleus reticularis ventralis (NRV), nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRGC), nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NRPGC), nucleus raphe obscurus (NRO), and medial portions of the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), were made in the rat. Electrical stimulation in all of these regions resulted in inhibition of the nociceptive tail-flick reflex, although the threshold intensity for inhibition was greater for sites in NTS compared to many sites ventral to the NTS. Antinociception was generally accompanied by an increase in mean arterial blood pressure, with the exception of sites in the NRO, where depressor responses were evoked by stimulation. Detailed comparisons between the NTS and NRV revealed that greater intensities of electrical stimulation were required to produce antinociception for sites in the NTS as compared to the NRV. There were no significant differences in threshold intensities for antinociception as a function of rostrocaudal subdivisions of the NTS, but the lateral subdivision of the NTS was significantly more efficacious than the medial subdivision. This mediolateral difference within NTS was primarily due to stimulation in medial sites producing overt movements in some animals, probably due to stimulation of adjacent midline nuclei or pathways. Within the NRV, thresholds for inhibition of the tail-flick reflex were greater for sites in the dorsal subdivision as compared to the ventral subdivision, which contains spinopetal projections from the NRM. The slopes of the lines of recruitment for inhibition of the tail-flick reflex at stimulation sites in either the NTS or NRV were both very steep, similar to other forms of antinociception. In experiment 2, the pulse duration of electrical stimulation was varied for sites of stimulation in the lateral NTS and NRV to generate strength-duration curves. This experiment confirmed that stimulation sites in the lateral NTS required greater current intensities to inhibit the tail-flick reflex than sites in the NRV. However, the chronaxies derived from the strength-duration functions for the NTS or NRV were both approximately 170 microseconds, indicating that the antinociceptive effects in these regions may not be exclusively due to the stimulation of fibers of passage. These results are discussed in terms of the role of the NTS, NRV, and caudal medulla in the modulation of nociceptive responses and cardiovascular function.\r"

In 15 of 20 rats contrast could be seen leaking out of the epidural space, usually after only 25 microliters was administered. Leakage was associated with diminished antinociceptive response to morphine administered via the catheter. Both leakage and decreased response to morphine could be largely prevented by applying a drop of Supa-Glue over the site of entry of the catheter to the epidural space at the time of catheter implantation. Investigators using epidurally cannulated rats should document that leakage does not occur or discard results from rats showing evidence of leakage.\r"

Several explanations for pain under-management have been proposed and these are reported. A clinical decision making model is also reviewed and it is suggested that this model could be applied to pain management problems. Further, it is suggested that this model may be very useful in developing educational interventions to improve health practitioners' clinical skills in pain management.\r"

We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon.\r"

No differences between active drug and placebo were found with respect to daily activities or use of analgesics. Based on our data and those of other studies, it is concluded that amitriptyline (and other antidepressants) in low doses does have a positive effect on the intensity and some other aspects of chronic pain, but that the effect is modest. It must be kept in mind that chronic pain is a very treatment-resistant condition. Therefore, even modest positive effects may be worthwhile.\r"

The pain had been occurring for more than 15 years, and a variety of therapies had been attempted with only partial, if any, success. Only morphine had succeeded in relieving the pain, but it had to be discontinued to avoid tolerance and dependence. We devised a treatment consisting of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vibratory stimulation (VS), and a combination of the two methods (TENS + VS). TENS brought about partial pain relief, but was less effective than VS; dual stimulation (TENS + VS) led to complete alleviation of the pain. Four months later, the patient was applying dual stimulation himself at home and was thus able to maintain complete relief with 3 or 4 weekly sessions. We suggest that dual stimulation results in a large-scale recruitment of large-diameter afferent fibres and may thus set up a powerful inhibitory control of nociception in our patient.\r"

The deafferented animals were then interbred, always selecting males and females that expressed relatively high and, alternatively, relatively low levels of autotomy. Offspring were similarly operated and interbred. By the sixth generation of selective breeding, lines were achieved in which autotomy was consistently high (HA) or consistently low (LA). There was no indication of sex linkage. Thermal and mechanical nocifensive responsiveness co-selected with propensity to express autotomy following nerve injury: response thresholds were lower in HA than in LA rats. F1 hybrids formed by crossing homozygous HA and LA animals showed low levels of autotomy, similar to LA stock. This indicates recessive inheritance of the autotomy trait. Backcrossing F1 hybrids onto the LA line yielded a low autotomy phenotype in almost all cases; backcrossing F1 hybrids onto HA stock yielded about 50% high autotomy and 50% low autotomy. These ratios are consistent with simple mendelian inheritance of a single gene. Taken together, the data suggest that autotomy is inherited as a single-gene autosomal recessive trait.\r"

This most likely results from the stimulated release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells. However, chronic pain models may more closely resemble human clinical pain, and the arthritic rat model has been used for screening potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for adrenal medullary tissue implanted into the spinal subarachnoid space to alleviate chronic pain. Adrenal medullary tissue was implanted into adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, and changes in body weight and vocalization responses were monitored over the 10 week course of the disease. Results indicate that the severe weight reduction normally associated with this inflammatory arthritis was attenuated by adrenal medullary, but not control, implants. In addition, vocalizations were reduced in animals implanted with adrenal medullary, but not control tissue following nicotine stimulation. This reduction was blocked by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, and partially attenuated by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine. Together, these results suggest that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord may provide a local source of opioid peptides and catecholamines for the reduction of chronic pain.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroendocrine and autonomic responses were assessed in chloralose-anesthetized cats after chemical stimulation of medial brain-stem regions, including those that influence nociceptive input to the medullary or spinal dorsal horn. Microinjections of L-glutamate (0.5 M, 160 nl) were directed at the following rostral and caudal raphe nuclei: the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), the raphe magnus (RM), and the raphe obscurus/raphe pallidus (Ro/Rpa). Activation of DR neurons evoked a significant increase in the adrenal secretion of epinephrine (+2.6 +/- 1.1 ng/min, P less than 0.01) that returned towards prestimulus values by 6 min, whereas microinjections into other raphe nuclei had no consistent effect. Activation of Ro/Rpa neurons evoked an increase in the plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH, +47.9 +/- 12.3 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), whereas microinjections into other raphe nuclei did not affect ACTH. Arterial pressure increased significantly after activation of PAG (+7.5 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, P less than 0.01) or of DR (+4.8 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) neurons, whereas heart rate increased significantly (P less than 0.05) after stimulation of cells within the Ro/Rpa. Glutamate microinjections within the RM, a raphe nucleus that exerts a significant descending influence on nociceptive input to the medullary and to the spinal dorsal horns, had no consistent effect on any measured variable. No evidence was seen to suggest that chemical activation of neurons within raphe nuclei inhibited the adrenal secretion of catecholamines or inhibited the release of ACTH. The results indicated that glutamate activation of neurons within different raphe nuclei evoked non-uniform effects on neuroendocrine and autonomic function. Further, these data suggested that the neural substrate underlying the control of the adrenal secretion of catecholamines and of the release of ACTH in response to activation of raphe neurons is likely distinct from that which contributes to the descending influence on nociceptive input to the medullary and spinal dorsal horn.\r"

The present investigation was designed to determine whether these increases may be mediated by substance P. Infusion of 1 mM of substance P in the dialysis fluid increased the concentrations of glutamate and aspartate, similar to the response seen during noxious stimulation. In addition, substance P also increased the concentrations of the inhibitory amino acids glycine and taurine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, previously shown to enhance substance P-induced biting and scratching behavior, produced no effect on amino acid release by itself but potentiated the apparent release of taurine by substance P. To assess the importance of substance P-induced amino acid release in sensory processing, we examined the influence of taurine and of excitatory amino acid antagonists on the biting and scratching behavior produced by excitatory amino acids and substance P. Taurine selectively inhibited only substance P-induced biting and scratching while excitatory amino acid antagonists inhibited only excitatory amino acid-induced behavior. To further explore the ability of taurine to inhibit the substance P-induced behavior, 3 tests of nociception were then used. Pretreatment with taurine inhibited the nociceptive-related writhing behavior produced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice but failed to alter the latency of response in the hot plate or tail flick assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Higher titers in the inner city were correlated with residence in census tracts where cases of pertussis were reported. Three hundred thirty-two children in a placebo arm of the study who were clinically observed and had paired serum samples taken during a 2- to 4-month period were analyzed for evidence of natural Bordetella infection. Twelve (11%) inner city children and three (1.3%) suburban children had spontaneous 4-fold or greater rises in at least two different pertussis antibodies measured (agglutinin, antitoxin or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG to pertussis toxin, IgG and IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin). Eighty percent of these children had IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin. Nine of 12 inner city children with serologic evidence of pertussis lived within 6 blocks of a case of pertussis reported within 1 month of the observed antibody rise in study subjects; none had a household member with pertussis and none had symptomatic disease.\r"

At that time the number of reported cases reached an all time low and no deaths caused by pertussis were reported. The vaccine (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine) had been given to infants 12 weeks old or older in a 0.5-ml dose by deep subcutaneous injection; three doses were given at intervals of 3 to 8 weeks and the fourth dose (booster) was given 12 to 18 months after the third dose. The immunization was completed with those four doses. Because whole cell vaccine appeared to be associated with severe neurologic illnesses, it was temporarily suspended in 1975. The vaccine was resumed soon thereafter but the age of administration was raised to 24 to 48 months. Under these circumstances acceptance rates of pertussis occurred, reaching a peak in 1979. Although whole cell vaccine was used even after temporary suspension, it was considered to be unacceptable by the public. As a result the acellular pertussis vaccine was developed and has totally replaced whole cell vaccine since 1981. A steady decrease in reported cases of pertussis as well as the number of deaths has been noted since 1979 in accordance with increase in vaccine acceptance rates. The national surveillance system begun in 1981 demonstrated also a steady decrease in the incidence of pertussis during the past 9 years.\r"

Gram-negative organisms (predominantly Klebsiella and Salmonella species) accounted for 86.5% of all isolates from measles patients, with 23% of these being multiply antibiotic-resistant. All the isolates from the general patients were fully susceptible to antibiotics. The duration of hospitalization was more than doubled in both groups of affected patients. The onset of hospital-acquired bacteremias occurred on an average of 11.2 days after admission in the patients with measles and 20.5 days in the general patients. Our findings revealed that nosocomial bacteremias occurred with greater frequency in patients with measles and contributed to the morbidity of these patients.\r"

Clearing of the effusion in both ears or in one when only one was involved was called complete resolution; clearing in one of two affected ears was called partial resolution. The outcomes 2 weeks after initiation of therapy of 26 patients initially treated with prednisone plus TMP/SMZ were complete resolution in 20, partial resolution in three, and unchanged in three. The outcomes in 27 patients initially treated with TMP/SMZ alone were complete resolution in eight, partial resolution in three, unchanged in 13 and development of acute otitis media in three (P less than 0.01 for complete resolution). Two weeks after initiation of therapy, patients with a MEE that failed to clear were crossed over to the alternative regimen. Overall 29 of 41 patients (71%) who received oral prednisone plus TMP/SMZ initially or after the crossover had complete resolution of their middle ear effusion at 2 weeks after starting prednisone and TMP/SMZ. Five of 35 (14%) patients treated with prednisone plus TMP/SMZ and one of six (17%) patients treated with TMP/SMZ alone who had complete resolution at 4 weeks required subsequent referrals for tympanostomy tubes. A course of prednisone for 7 days plus TMP/SMZ for 30 days with monthly follow-up should be considered in children with MEE persisting beyond 6-8 weeks before referral for tympanostomy tube placement.\r"

IgG immune complexes were measured by protein A-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) combined polyethylene glycol precipitations. Eight of 17 patients (47.1%) were found to have circulating immune complexes (CIC) values above the normal control range (geometric mean +2 SD). IgG subclass composition in CIC was analyzed. The subclasses in CIC were predominantly IgG1 and IgG3. Because the antibody responses to different antigens exhibit IgG subclass restriction, it would suggest that the change of serum and CIC IgG subclasses in Kawasaki syndrome may have relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

IgG4 deficiency was diagnosed in 14 (54%) children. One child had a deficiency of IgG2. There were no children with deficiencies of either IgG1 or IgG3. There was a significant correlation between IgG subclass deficiency and predisposition to infection (P less than 0.05). Ninety percent of the patients with severe infections had low IgG4 whereas only 25% of those with no infections had low concentrations of IgG4. These results suggest that it is important to screen patients with Down's syndrome who have frequent systemic or respiratory infections for IgG subclass deficiencies because this may not be apparent from the assay of total IgG.\r"

During 1983 and 1984, despite cohorting of patients and enforced hand washing, more than 200 cases of nosocomial multiply resistant Salmonella typhimurium phage type R-9 were observed on two adjacent pediatric wards. Most cases occurred during the summer months. After 19 new cases were detected early in the summer of 1985, oral administration of furazolidone throughout their entire hospital stay (2.5 mg/kg twice daily) was recommended for all subsequently hospitalized infants. Among the 114 (65%) infants who were appropriately treated, only one additional case (1%) was detected. In contrast 11 (19%) cases occurred among the 59 infants who were inappropriately treated: 5 of 35 (14%) of those who were not treated and 6 of 24 (25%) in whom treatment with furazolidone was delayed greater than 24 hours (P less than 0.001 between the appropriately and inappropriately treated groups). In pediatric wards where infection control measures cannot be optimally applied, prophylactic furazolidone administration may be helpful in preventing the spread of enteric pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the safety of the PRP-D conjugate Hib vaccine (ProHIBit, Connaught) in 29,309 children vaccinated at 18-60 months of age in the Southern California Kaiser Permanente medical clinics during the period April 1, 1988, to July 31, 1989. Surveillance for potential reactions involved postcard questionnaires, telephone surveys, reports of Kaiser staff and review of hospitalizations and covered two periods following immunization: (1) the first 48 hours and (2) days 2 through 30. Surveillance for invasive Hib disease involved the above methods in addition to systematic reviews of laboratory and hospital records through January 31, 1990. Rates of local and systemic reactions within 48 hours of vaccination with PRP-D alone were low (less than or equal to 2% for fever greater than 102 degrees F, local redness or swelling) and similar to those previously reported after vaccination with PRP. Hospitalization and seizures (0.15% and 0.09% of vaccinated children, respectively) occurring within 1 month of immunization appeared to be unrelated to vaccination. One 29-month-old child had onset of a fatal episode of Hib sepsis/meningitis within 48 hours of vaccination. Also, a 30-month-old child developed Hib meningitis 10 months after PRP-D vaccination. We conclude that PRP-D is safe when given alone or in combination with other childhood vaccines between 18 and 60 months of age.\r"

The seasonal distribution was striking, with a peak prevalence in the beginning of the rainy season (May 17.6%) when an epidemic outbreak of diarrhea started. The prevalence was highest in children younger than 18 months, an age at which prevalences of other intestinal parasites were low. This reverse age pattern may possibly be explained by the small infective dose needed to create severe infections, by air-borne transmission and by the development of protective immunity.\r"

To determine the safety and immunogenicity of diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis and oral polio immunization, 210 convalescing infants and children and community controls, comparable image and nutritional status, were studied. Using the pertussis agglutination and poliovirus neutralization tests, quantitative serologic responses were compared in the two study groups. No significant differences in the incidence rates of febrile reactions (23% in controls; 28% in convalescents) of local reactions (92% in controls; 87% in convalescents) and of seroconversion (P greater than 0.05) were noted between the two groups. Our investigation suggests that infants and children convalescing from infectious illnesses can be safely and effectively vaccinated. This study further suggests that hospitalization provides an opportunity to vaccinate such children.\r"

Therapy with intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) results in rapid defervescence, disappearance of signs and symptoms of inflammation and prevention of coronary artery aneurysms. We hypothesized that IVGG might neutralize a bacterial toxin produced by a staphylococcus or streptococcus present in the nasopharynx. We further speculated that this toxin might be detectable in serum or urine of patients. The goal of this work was to identify microbial antigens in different materials taken from patients with a clinical diagnosis of KS. We tested 23 aerobic bacterial isolates from throat cultures from 15 patients with KS, acute serum from 121 patients and 38 acute urine specimens from patients with KS. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 6 years. Specimens were tested in a standard system of counterimmunoelectrophoresis and reacted against IVGG prepared in a 25% solution. Ten of 23 aerobic bacteria (43.5%) isolated from throat cultures demonstrated a precipitation reaction with IVGG. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis testing of IVGG against acute serum and acute urine specimens was uniformly negative. IVGG contains precipitating antibody against a limited number of aerobic throat organisms. It is possible that antigenic products of one of these bacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of KS.\r"

Ten percent (24 of 248) of children admitted to a rehydration ward at Cayetano Heredia University Hospital, Lima, Peru, were infected with C. parvum. The 24 patients infected with C. parvum (cases) were matched to an equal number of noninfected patients (controls). C. parvum-infected patients were more likely to be malnourished than were children without this infection (P less than 0.05). Also nosocomial infection caused by C. parvum occurred in three severely malnourished patients, two of whom died. No other clinical or laboratory characteristics were found that would distinguish children with diarrhea caused by C. parvum from other children with diarrhea. In children hospitalized for diarrhea C. parvum infection occurs most frequently in malnourished children.\r"

Twenty-three children with prior Hib disease were immunized with Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate). Children 12 to 24 months of age were given one dose of vaccine and children younger than 12 months of age were given 2 doses 2 months apart. Antibody to the polysaccharide capsule of Hib (PRP) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Eighteen children had preimmunization serum antibody concentrations less than 0.150 micrograms/ml. All 18 children responded with greater than 0.150 micrograms/ml of antibody after a single dose of vaccine. Only 1 of the 23 children had a preimmunization serum antibody concentration greater than 1.000 micrograms/ml. Seventeen children ultimately responded with greater than 1.000 micrograms/ml of antibody (P less than 0.0001), concentrations of antibody thought to correlate with protection. Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate) is immunogenic in children with invasive Hib disease. Children younger than 2 years of age with invasive Hib disease should be subsequently immunized with a Hib conjugate vaccine.\r"

Serotyping results obtained by microneutralization tests and restriction endonuclease analysis were available for 105 of 127 cases. There were 69 males and 58 females and 94% of patients were less than 4 years of age. The average body temperature was 38 degrees C rectal (range, 36.2-40.8 degrees C) with an average duration of fever of 1.6 days. The average duration of clinical illness was 8.8 days (range, 1 to 32 days). Although Ad 40 and Ad 41 were isolated in the majority of cases (59 of 105 (56%], Ad 31 was associated with 18 of 105 cases (17%). Of the 18 cases associated with Ad 31, 14 were nosocomial and associated with diarrhea. Our survey confirms the importance of fastidious enteric Ad in infantile diarrhea (Ad 40, Ad 41) and suggests that Ad 31 produces a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from that caused by Ad 40 and Ad 41. The occurrence of Ad enteritis in patients admitted for unrelated illnesses well after initial hospitalization suggests that Ad is also an important cause of nosocomial enteritis in our hospital.\r"

The fact that each was able to establish a beneficial effect despite the small number of subjects studied is convincing evidence that such an effect exists. The studies from Rochester using oximetry and an analog illness severity scale indicate that this effect is both statistically significant and clinically relevant. These tools are reliable and easily applicable measures for multicenter studies when illness severity is selected as an outcome measure. Characteristics that should be taken into consideration when assigning experimental groups include age, sex, a history of prematurity or underlying conditions and arterial oxygen saturation. Future studies will address additional questions about the efficacy of ribavirin, such as its role in critically ill children, the economic benefits of its use in terms of duration of hospitalization, the usefulness of early treatment of RSV disease in high risk infants, and the impact of treatment on long-term consequences of RSV infection. These studies may require outcome variables and subject selection strategies different from those used in earlier studies.\r"

A small but significant risk of seroconversion occurs in health care workers who handle blood and body fluids of patients infected with HIV. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity in children who had phlebotomy as part of emergency care was measured. Of 749 blood samples, 21 (2.8%) tested positive for HIV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western Blot analysis: 14 samples from 6 patients with hemophilia, 6 from 3 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and 1 from a patient with asthma. Of these 21 blood samples, 10 were from 4 children previously known to be HIV positive, 4 were from patients with a known parental risk factor, and 16 were from patients with known history of blood transfusion. One sample was from a children with unknown HIV status and no documented risk factors. Procedures included 9 venipunctures, 17 intravenous line placements, 1 lumbar puncture, and 1 pelvic examination. Most patients with HIV seropositivity had been known to be HIV seropositive or at significant risk for HIV seropositivity. Although the potential risk to health care workers from children without known risk factors for HIV seropositivity was small in this population, the currently recommended infection-control precautions should always be observed.\r"

Children who were uninsured, poor, or nonwhite were less likely to have seen a physician in the past year (P less than .001), and uninsured children were less likely to have up-to-date immunizations. Logistic regression analyses revealed that poor, uninsured, or nonwhite children less frequently had a regular source of care; more frequently used emergency rooms, community clinics, and hospital outpatient departments as their regular providers; and more frequently encountered financial barriers to health care. Low-income or nonwhite children had much less access to care compared with children from more affluent or white families, independent of insurance status or health status.\r"

Young adults living in poverty, in households where the family reference person had less than a high school education, and who were male were at elevated risk of disability. Disabled young adults made almost three times as many physician contacts and were hospitalized for close to six times as many days as nondisabled young adults. One of every 5 disabled young adults was uninsured in 1984. Forty-one percent of disabled Hispanic 19- to 24-year-olds and 51% of disabled young adults of other races were uninsured compared with 19% of whites and blacks.

Their injuries and other pertinent data are discussed. Representatives from the Highway Safety Commission of each state were surveyed about their specific highway safety laws. The responses revealed that all states and the District of Columbia have child restraint requirements for passenger automobiles, 34 states have adult restraint laws, but only 17 states have any type of restriction for passengers riding in the back of pickup trucks.

The lack of prior experience with hair dryer burns initially led to suspicion of other causes. The characteristics of each case aided in the final determination of accidental vs nonaccidental injury. These cases prompted testing of home hair dryers to determine their heat output. At the highest heat settings, the dryers rapidly generated temperatures in excess of 110 degrees C. After the dryers were turned off, the protective grills maintained sufficient temperatures to cause full-thickness burns for up to 2 minutes. These cases and the results of testing demonstrate that hair dryers must be added to the list of known causes of accidental and nonaccidental burns in children.\r"

If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used. For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults). The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection. Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia. As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter.\r"

Neither presenting symptoms nor urine tests can distinguish self-inflicted infections from infections occurring spontaneously. However, no urinary tract malformations were detected among the boys with a history of urethral manipulation whereas one third of the other 21 boys had anomalies. If these data are confirmed by other studies, complete imaging investigation could then be avoided in such cases.

  ".W": "Previous prognostic studies of infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) have not adequately considered the heterogeneity of IUGR in terms of cause, severity, and body proportionality and have been prone to misclassification of IUGR because of errors in estimation of gestational age. Based on a cohort of 8719 infants with early-ultrasound-validated gestational ages and indexes of body proportionality standardized for birth weight, the consequences of severity and cause-specific IUGR and proportionality for fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality were assessed. With progressive severity of IUGR, there were significant (all P less than .001) linear trends for increasing risks of stillbirth, fetal distress (abnormal electronic fetal heart tracings)O during parturition, neonatal hypoglycemia (minimum plasma glucose less than 40 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (minimum Ca less than 7 mg/dL), polycythemia (maximum capillary hemoglobin greater than or equal to 21 g/dL), severe depression at birth (manual ventilation greater than 3 minutes), 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores less than or equal to 6, 1-minute Apgar score less than or equal to 3, and in-hospital death. These trends persisted for the more common outcomes even after restriction to term (37 to 42 weeks) births. There was no convincing evidence that outcome among infants with a given degree of growth retardation varied as a function of cause of that growth retardation. Among infants with IUGR, increased length-for-weight had significant crude associations with hypoglycemia and polycythemia, but these associations disappeared after adjustment for severity of growth retardation and gestational age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An accurate description of the population at risk for neonatal chronic lung disease is clearly of prime importance for comparative studies and the planning of interventions. Attempts to explain variations in chronic lung disease rates in such studies have been compromised by lack of a way of estimating the severity of the initial pulmonary disease as a risk factor. Therefore, a severity index was developed for use in very low birth weight (less than 1501 g) neonates. Special emphasis was placed on applicability of the index in the multicenter observational setting. Development followed a clinician panel approach, with the resulting index designed to capture clinical judgment of severity. The index was validated prospectively on neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit, and retrospectively using charts from nine hospitals nationwide. Correlations of the index with clinical judgment in the two samples were .95 and .93, respectively. In an additional validation the index combined with birth weight correctly predicted oxygen dependence status at 30 days in 36 of 42 neonates consecutively admitted to five neonatal intensive care units (P = .002). Birth weight and the severity index contributed about equally to the prediction, and therefore they seem to represent partly independent components of baseline propensity for prolonged oxygen dependence.\r"

A total of 23 infants with a birth weight less than 1500 g who were dependent on artificial ventilation 3 to 4 weeks of age received dexamethasone (n = 12) or saline placebo (n = 11). Dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg per day) was given in tapering doses for 7 days followed by hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg per day) which was progressively reduced for a total of 17 days of therapy. Infants who received dexamethasone required less oxygen on days 8 and 17 (P less than .05) and were more likely to extubate 8 days after therapy than infants in the control group (respectively 8/12 vs 3/11 infants, P less than .05; P = .12 after Yates correction). The use of dexamethasone significantly shortened median duration of mechanical ventilation (4 vs 22 days, P less than .05) but had no effect on length of oxygen therapy, hospitalization, home oxygen therapy, occurrence and severity of retinopathy of prematurity, rate of growth, and mortality. No significant complications resulted from dexamethasone therapy. Measurements of plasma dexamethasone levels confirmed the absorption of drug from the gastrointestinal tract (23.7 ng/mL in dexamethasone vs 4.6 ng/mL in the control group, P less than .05). Dexamethasone administration resulted in short-term improvements in pulmonary function but did not ameliorate the hospital course of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Early identification of neonates in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia is most likely to develop permits appropriate enrollment into clinical trials testing early intervention therapies for the prevention or treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Analysis of 160 neonatal intensive care unit survivors to 28 days revealed that supplemental oxygen requirement at 28 days could be predicted by a logistic regression including (1) birth weight, gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and peak inspiratory pressure at 12 hours for 12-hour-old neonates and (2) birth weight, gestational age, peak inspiratory pressure at 12 hours, and mean airway pressure at 10 days for 10-day-old neonates. These two regression analyses were applied prospectively to three new data sets totaling 238 neonates to test their predictive ability. Neonates were classified into low-, moderate-, or high-risk groups on the basis of their predicted probability of requiring oxygen supplementation at 28 days; low = probability of less than 25%, moderate = probability of 25% to 75%, and high = probability greater than 75%. Although these populations were demographically distinct from the original group, the regression analyses performed well. The regression analysis for 12 hours of age classified 125 neonates at low risk of whom 9% required supplemental oxygen at 28 days, and the regression analysis for 10 days classified 141 neonates at low risk of whom 7% required supplemental oxygen. The 12-hour regression analysis classified 80 neonates at moderate risk of whom 33% required supplemental oxygen at 28 days and the 10-day regression analysis classified 49 neonates at moderate risk of whom 24% required supplemental oxygen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many factors are associated with low breast-feeding rates among black low-income women. This study examines whether, despite such factors, health professionals' prenatal education of black poor women is associated with increased breast-feeding rates. Black women born in the United States who attended a midwives prenatal clinic (N = 159) were randomly assigned to two types of prenatal education or were followed up in a control group. All women were interviewed on entry into the study and after delivery of their infants. Women assigned to group classes attended at least one session discussing myths, problems, and benefits of breast-feeding. Women assigned to individual prenatal counseling spoke with a pediatrician or nurse practitioner, who discussed breast-feeding topics similar to those covered in the classes. Women in the control group received no additional prenatal education. The three study groups had significantly different percentages of women who breast-fed (controls 22%, classes 46%, individual sessions 53%). Higher percentages of women in the study groups carried out their prenatal plans to breast-feed (controls 50%, classes 86%, individual sessions 62%) or breast-fed despite prenatal plans to bottle-feed (controls 10%, classes 26%, individual sessions 48%). After multivariable analysis controlling for age, prenatal plans to breast-feed, prior breast-feeding experience, perceived support for breast-feeding, education, gravidity, and employment plans, women in intervention groups had a higher likelihood of breast-feeding than control subjects. These findings suggest that an increase in relatively simple, not-too-time-consuming educational efforts in institutions and offices serving black low-income women might yield significant narrowing of the gap in breast-feeding rates between white affluent women and black low-income women.\r"

  ".U": "91044776\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of a single dose of surfactant TA were assessed in premature neonates (birth weight 750 to 1749 g) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Only neonates with surfactant deficiency and without ultrasonographic evidence of intracranial hemorrhage greater than or equal to grade II were enrolled. Fifty-four patients received surfactant (100 mg of phospholipid per kilogram of body weight) and 46 patients received an air placebo within 8 hours of life. Treatment with this surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of RDS with a concomitant increase in the proportion of neonates with mild disease. The frequency of pulmonary interstitial emphysema and of pneumothorax was significantly lower in treated neonates compared with control neonates (2% vs 26%, P = .0008, and 7% vs 39%, P = .0004, respectively). The frequency of intracranial hemorrhage was significantly lower in the surfactant group compared with the control group (20% vs 54%, P = .0008) and was also reduced for the smallest neonates in the surfactant group (13% vs 73%, P = .00008). When categorized according to severity of intracranial hemorrhage and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the surfactant group was at a significant advantage (adjusted Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel X2 = 10.72, P less than .001 and X2 = 4.43, P = .036, respectively). The proportion of neonates surviving without intracranial hemorrhage and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 63% in the surfactant group vs 26% in the control group (P = .0004); as for the smallest neonates, it was 58% in the surfactant group vs 4% in the control group (P = .0002). There were no differences between the groups with respect to the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus (46% vs 37%), pulmonary hemorrhage (6% vs 7%), necrotizing enterocolitis (0% vs 2%), sepsis (4% vs 2%), retinopathy of prematurity (13% vs 22%), or death (15% vs 22%). It is concluded that treatment with the single-dose surfactant regimen used in this study reduces the severity of respiratory distress during the 48 hours after treatment and decreases the major pulmonary morbidity and intracranial hemorrhage in premature neonates with RDS. Further studies are needed to determine whether (1) treatment at birth or as soon as after RDS is diagnosed and (2) the use of multiple dose of this surfactant would result in any additional benefits.\r"

This project, a collaboration between the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine and the University of Minnesota, is studying the impact of screening infants for the preclinical detection of neuroblastoma on the population-based mortality caused by this tumor. All infants born in Quebec during a 5-year period will be screened twice, at 3 weeks and at 6 months. Urinary homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid determination from dried filter paper samples is used for screening. Initial qualitative screening is done by means of thin-layer chromatography with confirmatory quantitative screening by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During the initial 6 months of 3-week screening, 41,673 neonates (92% compliance rate) were screened and 10.6% of them were tested also by GC-MS. Nine of these neonates had positive results on two GC-MS tests and were referred for evaluation to rule out the presence of neuroblastoma. Four had the tumor, 1 had a calcified adrenal gland, and 4 had no tumor detected. Three additional neonates had clinical diagnosis of neuroblastoma before they reached the screening age of 3 weeks. A neuroblastoma that did not secrete homovanillic acid or vanillylmandelic acid was diagnosed clinically in 1 additional patient who tested negative by screening.\r"

Ensuring a productive interview involves controlling, as much as possible, the interview environment as well as the nurse's verbal and nonverbal communication. Patients who are cognitively impaired, angry, anxious, depressed, manipulative, or seductive can make this interview process more challenging. Working individually with each of these possible patient dynamics in a calm, controlled, and knowledgeable way can help facilitate the interview process and pave the way for fewer problems in the future. Frequently, the interview may involve the discussion of sensitive topics such as terminal illness, suicide, or sexuality. Gathering information and developing a comfort level in broaching these issues with patients are important goals for nursing professionals. Reading, attending workshops, consultation with professionals, and most important, self-assessment of these sensitive topics are all useful tools in obtaining those goals.\r"

Comparison of laboratory test results and changes with abnormal physical findings provides the basis for changes in the nursing care plan. Progressive monitoring of laboratory results and prompt interventions might lessen the seriousness of the health problem. In acute care units, the initial group of laboratory tests serves as a baseline for assessing additional test results. Several reference values should be remembered, particularly the electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and calcium), glucose, BUN, creatinine, and albumin. Specific group profiles assist in identifying and in monitoring the patient's health status. Incorporating laboratory test results into the plan and evaluation of care will result in safer and more effective patient care. Referring to laboratory test findings and comparing them with physical assessment findings are required for the delivery of professional nursing care.\r"

The detection of these findings enables the nurse to manage gastrointestinal emergencies on the patient unit in a timely fashion, preventing deterioration and maintaining the safety of the patient. These skills build well on the traditional, detailed, and comprehensive assessments the nurse makes when using the nursing process. Specific abdominal assessments include detection of signs associated with appendicitis such as rebound tenderness and McBurney's, Rosvig's, and Aaron's signs. The nurse must always be alert to the possibility of peritonitis and the urgency of early detection and treatment. The patient with cirrhosis of the liver presents a distinct clinical picture. There is a need for subtle evaluation of mental status to detect early signs of hepatic coma. Another extra-abdominal assessment of this complication is asterixis. Finally, the assessment of the patient is enhanced when the nurse is able to help identify the location of bleeding. Improving abdominal and gastrointestinal system assessment leads to early detection of nursing problems and appropriate interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Thorough assessment of older men and women is a complex but vital part of their health care. The ability to differentiate the changes owing to normal aging from those resulting from pathologic processes is necessary if their lives are to be as productive and enjoyable as they are prolonged. Each body system and function must be examined or tested with this difference in mind. Because aging occurs in different individuals at differing rates, a variety of functions may all be considered healthy or normal. Assessment findings must be viewed through the focus of the individual person as well as that of the population. The nurse will find opportunities to use assessment skills for older adults in many settings, ranging from independent living arrangements to institutional residential areas. In the community, social meeting places, day-care facilities, meal sites, and shopping areas are but a few of the places where older adults may be found, alone or in groups. Assessment opportunities can be identified or structured in any milieu. The setting itself, as well as the needs of the older adult(s), will help to determine the complexity of the assessment activities. The benefit to nursing of increased and expanded ability to assess the older adult is considerable. The organized concern of science and health care with aging is a relatively recent phenomenon. The older adults of today are unique--there are more of them than ever before, and they are living longer. Although their lives are not without health complications, they are, in a sense, role models for the rest of us: pathfinders in aging who can, if we observe them carefully, give us insight and direction for our own healthy aging processes and those of generations to come. Nursing is uniquely poised to use our caring methodology with the older adult. The elderly are interested in their health and willingly cooperate with those whose assessments are knowledgeable and realistic. Nursing is challenged to develop and implement advanced and specialized ways to identify and meet their needs.\r"

There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief. Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics. Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched. Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain.\r"

The stress response can be viewed as an interactional process that causes psychophysiologic reactions that are immediate and can occur up to and including physiologic events 3 weeks after confrontation with the stressor. The literature suggests that neuroendocrine alterations in response to confrontation with a stressor may influence immunocompetence. Intervention and prevention studies of stress focus on pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, behavioral techniques, personality engineering, relaxation training, and biofeedback.

Drug therapy is effective for panic disorder, while agoraphobia may respond to drug therapy or to a range of cognitive therapies.\r"

In this paper, we show that two beta-IFN promoter elements, positive regulatory domains I and II (PRDI and PRDII), which are required for virus induction of the beta-IFN gene are also required for the postinduction turnoff. Although protein synthesis is not necessary for activation, it is necessary for repression of these promoter elements. Examination of nuclear extracts from cells infected with virus reveals the presence of virus-inducible, cycloheximide-sensitive, DNA-binding activities that interact specifically with PRDI or PRDII. We propose that the postinduction repression of beta-IFN gene transcription involves virus-inducible repressors that either bind directly to the positive regulatory elements of the beta-IFN promoter or inactivate the positive regulatory factors bound to PRDI and PRDII.\r"

  ".W": "For fusion to occur the repulsive forces between two interacting phospholipid bilayers must be reduced. In model systems, this can be achieved by increasing the surface tension of at least one of the membranes. However, there has so far been no evidence that the secretory granule membrane is under tension. We have been studying exocytosis by using the patch-clamp technique to measure the surface area of the plasma membrane of degranulating mast cells. When a secretory granule fuses with the plasma membrane there is a step increase in the cell surface area. Some fusion events are reversible, in which case we have found that the backstep is larger than the initial step, indicating that there is a net decrease in the area of the plasma membrane. The decrease has the following properties: (i) the magnitude is strongly dependent on the lifetime of the fusion event and can be extensive, representing as much as 40% of the initial granule surface area; (ii) the rate of decrease is independent of granule size; and (iii) the decrease is not dependent on swelling of the secretory granule matrix. We conclude that the granule membrane is under tension and that this tension causes a net transfer of membrane from the plasma membrane to the secretory granule, while they are connected by the fusion pore. The high membrane tension in the secretory granule may be the critical stress necessary for bringing about exocytotic fusion.\r"

The frequency of rearrangement is lower in homozygous states of the parental allele than in heterozygotes. In both cases, the rearrangement is shown to be mitotic.

  ".W": "Disruption of the cyr1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which encodes adenylyl cyclase, did not confer lethality to fission yeast cells, although they grew 40% slower than wild-type strains in complete medium. These cells contained no measurable amount of cAMP and no adenylyl cyclase activity. When h+ and h- cyr1 disruptants were mixed, they underwent mating even in rich medium. Propagation of homothallic cyr1 disruptants was difficult, probably because such cells readily mate and produce asci and thus stop growing. A greater than 10-fold increase in the amount of cyr1 mRNA was observed when cloned cyr1+ was introduced into Sch. pombe cells on a multicopy plasmid. The total adenylyl cyclase activity was similarly high in these transformants. However, the level of intracellular cAMP was hardly affected. Evidence suggests that this was not due to increased phosphodiesterase activity. Thus, cAMP level in growing fission yeast cells appears to be regulated not by the amount of adenylyl cyclase protein but by a feedback mechanism at the enzyme level. The cAMP level fell by approximately 50% under nitrogen starvation, which triggers sexual development in Sch. pombe. We suggest that fission yeast controls the level of intracellular cAMP primarily to regulate sexual development rather than to drive or arrest the cell cycle.\r"

Since the outputs of the detectors, responding to an image undergoing two-dimensional rigid translation, are dependent on both the image velocity and the image intensity distribution, they are nonuniform across the entire image, even though the object is moving rigidly as a whole. To achieve perceptual \"oneness\" in the rigid motion, we are led to contend that visual perception must take place in a space that is non-Euclidean in nature. We then derive the affine connection and the metric of this perceptual space. The Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero, which means that the perceptual space is intrinsically flat. A geodesic in this space is composed of points of constant image intensity gradient along a certain direction. The deviation of geodesics (which are perceptually \"straight\") from physically straight lines may offer an explanation to the perceptual distortion of angular relationships such as the Hering illusion.\r"

Channel gating is voltage-dependent; open probability, Po, reaches maximum (approximately 0.7) at a transmembrane voltage of -80 mV (cytoplasmic surface negative) and declines at both more negative and more positive voltages (i.e., to 0 around +80 mV). The time-averaged current-voltage curve shows strong rectification, with negative currents (positive charges flowing from vacuolar side to cytoplasmic side) much larger than positive currents. The open probability also depends strongly on cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration but, for ordinary recording conditions, is high only at unphysiologically high (greater than or equal to 1 mM) Ca2+. However, reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol poise the channels so that they can be activated by micromolar cytoplasmic Ca2+. The channels are blocked irreversibly by chloramine T, which is known to oxidize exposed methionine and cysteine residues specifically.\r"

No evidence for expression of injected exogenous mRNA, however, has been reported in terminally differentiated neurons. If achieved, it would allow the study of long-lasting changes of properties of nerve cells in their functional context. To obtain evidence of such expression, we chose two proteins that produce a detectable effect even at very low intracellular concentrations. Tetanus toxin and botulinum neurotoxin fulfill this criterion, being the most potent neurotoxins known. Both toxins block neurotransmitter release at nanomolar intracellular concentrations. These di-chain proteins, consisting of a light chain and a heavy chain, have recently been sequenced. Their active sites are located (or partly located) on the light chain. mRNAs encoding the light chain of either toxin were transcribed in vitro from the cloned and specifically truncated genes of Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum, respectively, and injected into presynaptic cholinergic neurons of the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. Depression of neurotransmitter release appeared in less than 1 hr, demonstrating successful expression of foreign mRNA injected into a neuron in situ.\r"

(1987) Cell 51, 919-928], is expressed in striated and smooth muscles as well as in non-muscle tissues. Examination of its primary structure has revealed that the molecule is composed of four domains, three of which share many features with the membrane cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and actinin. Dystrophin has thus been predicted to adopt a rod shape [Koenig, M., Monaco, A. P. & Kunkel, L. M. (1988) Cell 53, 219-228]. In the present study, we describe its isolation from the chicken gizzard smooth muscle and present electron microscopic images of the molecule. Polyclonal antibodies were first prepared from a dystrophin fragment derived from the chicken skeletal muscle gene (residues 1173-1728). A dystrophin-enriched membrane preparation from chicken gizzard muscle was then purified by passing it through an affinity chromatography column made with the anti-dystrophin antibodies. Electron microscopy of isolated and rotatory-shadowed dystrophin molecules revealed that the lengths measured for the dystrophin monomers (175 +/- 15 nm) are compatible with a structural arrangement of the repeat sequence segments in triple-barrel alpha-helices connected by short-turn regions, as was earlier postulated for the repeat domains of spectrin and actinin. Electron microscopic images indicate that in addition the dystrophin molecules could present the same capacity of self-association in oligomeric structures as these cytoskeletal proteins and may thus be a part of a complex molecular meshwork essential to muscle cell function.\r"

Antigen-specific T-cell activation involves T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of a peptide antigen presented by a major histocompatibility complex molecule, and much has been learned about this antigen-recognition process through structural and genetic studies of mammalian TCRs. Although previous studies have demonstrated that avian T cells express cell-surface molecules analogous to the mammalian TCR heterodimers, TCR genes have not been identified in nonmammalian species. We now report the cloning of a cDNA that encodes the beta chain of the chicken TCR. Southern blot analysis using this TCR beta cDNA probe demonstrated that the chicken TCR beta locus was clonally rear-ranged in chicken T-cell lines. TCR beta mRNA was expressed in cells isolated from the thymus but not in cells from the bursa of Fabricius where B cells are generated. Sequence analysis of six additional TCR beta cDNAs suggested the existence of at least two variable (V) region families, three joining (J) elements, and single diversity (D) and constant (C) elements. As in mammals, considerable nucleotide diversity was observed at the junctions of the variable, diversity, and joining elements in chicken TCR beta cDNAs. Genomic V beta and J beta elements were also cloned and sequenced. Both elements are flanked by classical heptamer/nonamer recombination signal sequences. Although the chicken and mammalian TCR beta chains displayed only 31% overall amino acid sequence identity, a number of conserved structural features were observed. These data indicate that (i) the chicken TCR beta repertoire is generated by combinatorial and junctional diversity and (ii) despite divergent evolution at the level of nucleotide sequence, important structural features of the TCR beta polypeptide are conserved between avian and mammalian species.\r"

We found a dissociation of NF-kappa B translocation from transactivation of either the HIV LTR or the HIV enhancer. Interleukin 2 induced proliferation but not NF-kappa B translocation or LTR transactivation. Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced HIV LTR transactivation, whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 did not. The two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce NF-kappa B translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester. Our finding that induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is not sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation. Furthermore, our results suggest that events linked to T-cell activation, in addition to NF-kappa B translocation per se, induce functional interactions of the NF-kappa B complex with the HIV enhancer.\r"

We report a G----T mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the androgen receptor gene of a 46,XY subject lacking detectable androgen binding to the receptor and with the complete form of androgen insensitivity. This point mutation completely abolishes normal RNA splicing at the exon 4/intron 4 boundary and results in the activation of a cryptic splice donor site in exon 4, which leads to the deletion of 123 nucleotides from the mRNA. Translation of the mutant mRNA results in an androgen receptor protein approximately 5 kDa smaller than the wild type. This mutated androgen receptor protein was unable to bind androgens and unable to activate transcription of an androgen-regulated reporter gene construct. This mutation in the human androgen receptor gene demonstrates the importance of an intact steroid-binding domain for proper androgen receptor functioning in vivo.\r"

Thus, in male hepatocytes, estrogen receptor is the limiting regulatory factor that in the female liver controls efficient and accurate sex-specific expression of the vitellogenin gene. Furthermore, the Xenopus liver factor B, which is essential in addition to the estrogen receptor for the activation of this gene, was successfully replaced in the Xenopus extract by purified human nuclear factor I, identifying factor B of Xenopus as a functional homolog of this well-characterized human transcription factor.\r"

In the mutants, a tyrosine residue in the vicinity of the primary electron donor and acceptor molecules was replaced by either phenylalanine or isoleucine. The electron-transfer reaction is slower in the mutants and has a qualitatively different dependence on temperature. In native reaction centers the rate increases as the temperature is reduced, in the phenylalanine mutant it is virtually independent of temperature, and in the isoleucine mutant it decreases with decreasing temperature. At 77 K, the electron-transfer reaction is approximately 30 times slower in the isoleucine mutant than in the native. These observations support the view that tyrosine-(M)210 plays an important role in the electron-transfer mechanism. In the isoleucine mutant at low temperatures, the stimulated emission from the excited reaction center undergoes a time-dependent shift to shorter wavelengths.\r"

  ".W": "To eliminate the gap between the biochemistry of actomyosin in solution and the physiology of contracting muscle, we developed an in vitro force-movement assay system in which the steady-state force-velocity relation in the actin-myosin interaction can be studied. The assay system consists of the internodal cells of an alga, Nitellopsis obtusa, containing well-organized actin filament arrays (actin cables); tosyl-activated polystyrene beads (diameter, 2.8 microns; specific gravity, 1.3) coated with skeletal muscle myosin; and a centrifuge microscope equipped with a stroboscopic light source and a video system. The internodal cell preparation was mounted on the rotor of the centrifuge microscope, so that centrifugal forces were applied to the myosin-coated beads moving along the actin cables in the presence of ATP. Under constant centrifugal forces directed opposite to the bead movement (\"positive\" loads), the beads continued to move with constant velocities, which decreased with increasing centrifugal forces. The steady-state force-velocity curve thus obtained was analogous to the double-hyperbolic force-velocity curve of single muscle fibers. The unloaded velocity of bead movement was 1.6-3.6 microns/s (20-23 degrees C), while the maximum \"isometric\" force generated by the myosin molecules on the bead was 1.9-39 pN. If, on the other hand, the beads were subjected to constant centrifugal forces in the direction of bead movement (\"negative\" loads), the bead also moved with constant velocities. Unexpectedly, the velocity of bead movement did not increase with increasing negative loads but first decreased by 20-60% and then increased towards the initial unloaded velocity until the beads were eventually detached from the actin cables.\r"

To determine the ionic mechanism of increased HCO3- reabsorption, we have examined the effect of AII on luminal Na(+)-H+ exchange and basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransport in perfused S1 proximal tubules isolated from superficial nephrons of the rabbit kidney. Transporter activity was assessed by removing Na+ from both luminal and basolateral (i.e., bath) solutions and determining the rate at which intracellular pH (pHi) increased after Na+ was returned to only the lumen or only the bath. pHi was measured with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2', 7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein. We found that basolateral administration of 1 nM AII not only increased the rate of luminal Na(+)-H+ exchange approximately 3.5-fold but also increased the rate of basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransport approximately 2.5-fold. 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (50 microM) blocked luminal Na(+)-H+ exchange before and after stimulation by AII but had no effect on basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransport. Conversely, 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate (50 microM) blocked basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransport before and after AII but had no effect on luminal Na(+)-H+ exchange. Our data thus indicate that, at least under the conditions of our assay, AII independently stimulates the transporters responsible for both the luminal and basolateral steps of transepithelial HCO3- reabsorption.\r"

  ".U": "91045910\r", 
  ".W": "The ras gene product (p21) is a GTP-binding protein and has been thought to transduce signals regulating proliferation or differentiation of cells. Like other GTP-binding proteins, p21.GTP is an active conformation, which can transduce the signals downstream, whereas p21.GDP is an inactive one. Recently, we have shown that p21.GTP levels increased in cells treated with fetal bovine serum or platelet-derived growth factor to initiate DNA synthesis. In this paper, we report that epidermal growth factor can also increase the amounts of p21.GTP in the cells. Effects of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor are not additive. In contrast, mutant [Val12]p21, which has transforming activity, responded neither to platelet-derived growth factor nor to epidermal growth factor. We also found that the ratio of p21.GTP to p21.GDP increased 3- to 4-fold in transformants carrying activated erbB-2/neu or v-src oncogenes. These results strongly suggest an important role of p21 in transduction of signals for both normal proliferation and malignant transformation through growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity or related oncogene products.\r"

Treatment of these cultures with anti-gamma delta TCR antibodies did not prevent gamma delta T-cell development but led to a striking increase in the frequency of noncanonical in-frame sequences. We conclude from this finding that cells expressing the canonical TCR accumulate selectively as a result of TCR-mediated positive selection in the fetal thymus.\r"

  ".U": "91045913\r", 
  ".W": "Nascent precursors of phosphatidylinositol-glycan (PI-G)-linked membrane proteins contain a hydrophobic COOH-terminal sequence of 15-30 residues that is eliminated during processing to yield a newly exposed COOH terminus to which the PI-G moiety is added. There is no consensus as to the primary structure of the terminal peptide but there is a specific requirement for the amino acid destined to become the COOH terminus. In nascent human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), the PI-G tail is attached to Asp-484. Site-directed mutants with glycine, alanine, cysteine, serine, or asparagine (category I) at residue 484 become PI-G tailed, appear in the plasma membrane, and are enzymatically active when expressed in COS cells. Although mutants with glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, tryptophan, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, threonine, methionine, and tyrosine (category II) are expressed equally well, only small amounts appear on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, they are not PI-G tailed and have little alkaline phosphatase activity. Studies with truncated PLAP-489 rule out nonspecific conformational changes in category II mutant proteins as a reason for their failure to be processed in COS cells and point to a specific COOH-terminal processing enzyme. Direct evidence that the selectivity for category I amino acids is enzymatically determined was obtained in a cell-free translation/processing system by using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and CHO cell rough microsomal membranes. In this in vitro system, both category I and category II mutants of PLAP-513 were translated, glycosylated, and cleaved by NH2-terminal signal peptidase. However, an additional and selective cleavage at residue 484 was observed only with category I mutants.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of mRNAs coding for the sea urchin embryo regulatory factors P3A1 and P3A2 was measured by single-strand probe excess solution hybridization. P3A1 and P3A2 are not homologous proteins, though they both bind specifically to a particular cis-regulatory sequence. Interaction at this target site is known to be required for lineage-specific expression of an aboral ectoderm-specific gene and probably for several other genes as well. Genome blot hybridizations show that both factors are encoded by single-copy genes. Maternal mRNAs for both factors are present at less than 10(3) molecules per egg, which places them in the rare mRNA class. During development to the mesenchyme blastula stage, the amount of P3A1 mRNA (per embryo) increases severalfold while that of P3A2 remains approximately constant. Specification of the aboral ectoderm founder cells and of their initial patterns of gene expression must occur during early to mid-cleavage stage. Therefore, the regulatory proteins needed for this process must be produced by this stage. We show that the quantities of the P3A proteins that can be synthesized from the numbers of mRNA molecules present in the large blastomeres of the early embryo are sufficient to be functional, because these proteins will be accumulated in the nuclei. Thus maternal P3A1 or P3A2 proteins asre not required, nor were these detected in earlier studies. Furthermore, differential spatial (as well as temporal) distribution of both of these newly synthesized factor species could result from the unequal cleavage pattern utilized in the sea urchin egg.\r"

  ".W": "Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are stemloop structures found in the mRNAs encoding ferritin and the transferrin receptor. These elements participate in the iron-induced regulation of the translation of ferritin and the stability of the transferrin receptor mRNA. Regulation in both instances is mediated by binding of a cytosolic protein to the IREs. High-affinity binding is seen when cells are starved of iron and results in repression of ferritin translation and inhibition of transferrin receptor mRNA degradation. The IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) has been identified as an approximately 90-kDa protein that has been purified by both affinity and conventional chromatography. In this report we use RNA affinity chromatography and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to isolate the IRE-BP for protein sequencing. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe derived from a single peptide sequence was used to isolate a cDNA clone that encodes a protein containing 13 other sequenced peptides obtained from the IRE-BP. Consistent with previous characterization of the IRE-BP, the cDNA encodes a protein of 87 kDa with a slightly acidic pI, and the corresponding mRNA of approximately 3.6 kilobases is found in a variety of cell types. The encoded protein contains a nucleotide-binding consensus sequence and regions of cysteine and histidine clusters. This mRNA is encoded by a single gene on human chromosome 9, a finding consistent with previous localization by functional mapping. The protein contains no previously defined consensus motifs for either RNA or DNA binding. The simultaneous cloning of a different, but highly homologous, cDNA suggests that the IRE-BP is a member of a distinct gene family.\r"

The mAb also neutralized the virus-encoded DNA polymerase activity from cells infected with human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, and the purified bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerases. However, mAb 55H3 did not neutralize the DNA polymerase activities encoded for by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, the reverse transcriptase of avian myeloblastosis virus, or Escherichia coli DNA polymerase 1 (Klenow fragment).

Using HLA-DR gene-transfected mouse L-cell lines as antigen-presenting cells, we established that of the 20 hMBP-specific T-lymphocyte lines, 7 were restricted by the DR2a gene products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype. Four T-cell lines recognized hMBP in the context of the DR2b products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype. DR2b-restricted T-cell responses were demonstrable only in T-cell lines derived from MS patients. The hMBP epitopes presented by the DR2a heterodimer were mapped to peptides covering amino acid residues 1-44, 76-91, 131-145, or 139-153 and to a region spanning the thrombin-cleaved bond at Arg130-Ala131. DR2b-restricted T-cell lines recognized epitopes within amino acids 80-99 and 148-162. Peptide 139-153 was also presented in the context of HLA-DR1 molecules. Our data show that (i) in MS patients both the DR2a and DR2b products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype function as restriction elements for the myelin autoantigen hMBP, (ii) the DR2a molecule presents at least five different epitopes to hMBP-specific T lymphocytes, and (iii) anti-hMBP T-cell lines derived from individual donors can differ in their antigen fine specificity as well as in their HLA restriction.\r"

  ".W": "A critical step in the import of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into mitochondria involves proteolytic cleavage of their amino-terminal leader peptides by processing proteases found in the mitochondrial matrix. We report here the characterization of the general matrix processing protease from rat liver mitochondria. The final enzyme preparation consisted of two polypeptides, a catalytically active 55-kDa subunit and a 52-kDa one. To deduce the complete primary structure of the 55-kDa subunit, we first sequenced its mature amino terminus and several tryptic peptides derived from the pure protein. Next, using mixed oligonucleotide primers that had sequences based on two of these peptides, we synthesized a partial cDNA probe by selective amplification of liver RNA with the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified probe was then used to obtain a nearly full-length clone from a rat liver cDNA library. This cDNA codes for 508 amino acid residues, including 16 residues of an amino-terminal leader peptide, the cleavage site of which is located two polypeptide bonds downstream from an arginine residue. The mature portion has a predicted molecular mass of 55.2 kDa; it shows 36% identity with the mitochondrial processing peptidases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa. A conserved structural feature is a putative, negatively charged alpha-helix, located in the amino-terminal half of the subunit; this element might be important for the recognition of positively charged leader peptides characteristic of mitochondrial precursor proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty gibberellins (GAs) have been identified in extracts from shoots of the Landsberg erecta line of Arabidopsis thaliana by full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Kovats retention indices. Eight of them are members of the early-13-hydroxylation pathway (GA53, GA44, GA19, GA17, GA20, GA1, GA29, and GA8), six are members of the early-3-hydroxylation pathway (GA37, GA27, GA36, GA13, GA4, and GA34), and the remaining six are members of the non-3,13-hydroxylation pathway (GA12, GA15, GA24, GA25, GA9, and GA51). Seven of these GAs were quantified in the Landsberg erecta line of Arabidopsis and in the semidwarf ga4 and ga5 mutants by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring (SIM) using internal standards. The relative levels of the remaining 13 GAs were compared by the use of ion intensities only. In comparison with the Landsberg erecta line, the ga4 mutant had reduced levels of the 3-hydroxy- and 3,13-dihydroxy-GAs, and it accumulated the 13-hydroxy-GAs, except GA53, and the non-3,13-hydroxy-GAs, except GA12. The GA4 gene encodes, therefore, a protein with 3 beta-hydroxylation activity. The ga5 mutant had reduced levels of the C19-GAs, which indicates that the product of the GA5 gene catalyzes the elimination of C-20 at the aldehyde level. The ga5 mutant also had increased levels of certain C20-GAs, which indicates existence of an additional control, possibly hydroxylation of C-20. The growth-response data, as well as the accumulation of GA9 in the ga4 mutant, indicate that GA9 is not active in Arabidopsis, but it must be 3 beta-hydroxylated to GA4 to become bioactive. It is concluded that the reduced levels of the 3 beta-hydroxy-GAs, GA1 and GA4, are the cause of the semidwarf growth habit of both mutants.\r"

  ".W": "Shortly after their birth, postmitotic mononucleated myoblasts in myotomes, limb buds, and conventional muscle cultures elongate and assemble a cohort of myofibrillar proteins into definitively striated myofibrils. MyoD induces a number of immortalized and/or transformed nonmuscle cells to express desmin and several myofibrillar proteins and to fuse into myosacs. We now report that MyoD converts normal dermal fibroblasts, chondroblasts, gizzard smooth muscle, and pigmented retinal epithelial cells into elongated postmitotic mononucleated striated myoblasts. The sarcomeric localization of antibodies to desmin, alpha-actinin, titin, troponin-I, alpha-actin, myosin heavy chain, and myomesin in these converted myoblasts are indistinguishable from in vivo and in vitro normal myoblasts. Converted myoblasts fuse into typical anisodiametric multinucleated myotubes that often contract spontaneously. Conversion and subsequent expression of the skeletal myogenic program are autonomous events, occurring in four nonmuscle microenvironments consisting of different combinations of foreign extracellular matrix molecules. Early events associated with conversion by MyoD involve (i) withdrawal from the cell cycle, (ii) down-regulation of the subverted cell's ongoing differentiation program, and (iii) initiation of desmin synthesis in presumptive myoblasts and dramatic redistribution of microtubules and desmin intermediate filaments in postmitotic myoblasts.\r"

These transgenic mice gave rise to tumors in subcutaneous soft tissue, which was attributed to transgene expression at this site. An immunohistochemical analysis of transgenic fetuses from several independent lines revealed scattered T-antigen-containing mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts in the subcutaneous layer of the skin between the panniculus carnosus muscle of the skin and the skeletal muscle of the body wall. This localization is consistent with the location of overt tumorigenesis in adult mice. This pattern was specific for the renin-T antigen fusion gene as no immunohistochemical staining was observed in transgenic fetuses containing a heterologous promoter-T antigen fusion gene. Northern blot analysis of tumor RNA indicated that most of the tumors expressed both T antigen and the endogenous renin gene Ren-1c. In addition, when multiple renin genes were introduced by crossing transgenic mice with nontransgenic DBA/2J mice, which contain another allele of the Ren-1 locus as well as the duplicated locus Ren-2, the resultant tumors expressed the Ren-2 gene. Northern blots were then used to analyze renin expression in the subcutaneous tissue of normal mice. Fully processed renin mRNA was detected in eviscerated 15.5-day postcoitus fetal and newborn carcasses and in newborn skin. Our data indicate that there is a renin-expressing cell population in fetal and newborn subcutaneous tissue.\r"

In each experiment ovariectomized, nulliparous rats whose endogenous PRL levels were suppressed with bromocriptine were tested for maternal behavior toward foster young. In experiments 1, 2, and 4, females were also exposed to pregnancy-like levels of progesterone (days 1-11) followed by estradiol (days 11-17). In experiment 1 infusions (days 11-13) of four doses of ovine PRL (400 ng, 2 micrograms, 10 micrograms, or 50 micrograms, but not 80 ng) into the lateral ventricle resulted in a rapid onset of maternal behavior (behavioral testing, days 12-17). The stimulatory action of these doses of PRL appears to be central, since subcutaneous injections of 50 micrograms of ovine PRL failed to affect maternal responsiveness (experiment 2). Experiment 3 indicated that the stimulatory effect of intracerebroventricularly administered PRL is steroid dependent. Infusions of either 10 micrograms of ovine PRL or 10 micrograms of rat PRL failed to induce maternal behavior in nonsteroid-treated animals. In the final experiment (no. 4) bilateral infusions of 40 ng of ovine PRL into the medial preoptic area of steroid-treated rats resulted in a pronounced stimulation of maternal behavior. These findings demonstrate a central site of PRL action in the stimulation of maternal responsiveness and point to the medial preoptic area as a key neural site for PRL regulation of maternal behavior.\r"

When a chimeric gene, in which a reporter gene for bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) was placed downstream of the 5' flanking sequences of the par gene, was introduced into tobacco mesophyll protoplasts by electroporation, the chimeric gene elicited auxin-regulated expression of GUS activity. Because deletion of a 111-base-pair (bp) direct repeat in the 5' flanking sequences of the par gene abolished the auxin-induced GUS activity, it is deduced that in the 111-bp direct repeat of the par gene promoter is localized an auxin-responsive region, which regulates auxin-mediated activation of transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamate-induced delayed neurotoxicity after abusive and paroxismal activation of its receptors has been proposed to depend upon a sustained increase in intracellular free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i). To elucidate the temporal and causal relationship between glutamate-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and neuronal death, we simultaneously studied the dynamics of [Ca2+]i changes in single neurons with the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 and the cell viability by imaging the nuclear penetration of propidium iodide. The main difference between toxic (50 microM) and nontoxic (5 microM) doses of glutamate is the lack of regulation in [Ca2+]i 20 min after glutamate is removed. This protracted rise in [Ca2+]i in a single cell is correlated with (r = 0.87, P less than 0.01, Spearman's test), and consequently predictive of, the time of appearance of neuronal death, as measured by propidium iodide fluorescence. In addition, the glutamate receptor antagonists dibenzocyclohepteneimine (MK-801) and 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl 1-phosphate reduce the acute increase of [Ca2+]i induced by glutamate but fail to revert the protracted increase of [Ca2+]i, elicited by toxic doses of glutamate. In contrast, the ganglioside GM1 and the semisynthetic lysoGM1 with N-acetylsphingosine (LIGA-4) and lysoGM1 with N-dichloroacetylsphingosine (LIGA-20) failed to change the immediate rise of [Ca2+]i elicited by glutamate but prevented the protracted increase in [Ca2+]i after toxic doses of glutamate. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers (nifedipine, etc.) did not change the initial or protracted responses to glutamate.\r"

  ".W": "The murine homolog of the fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF-5) gene has been cloned, and the sequence of the gene's three exons has been determined. The murine gene and the previously isolated human FGF-5 gene are substantially homologous within the coding sequences and in upstream sequences, which contain an additional open reading frame. We have used a portion of the murine gene as probe to detect FGF-5 RNA in adult mouse tissues by both Northern blot and in situ hybridization methods. FGF-5 RNA is present at low levels in widely distributed areas of the central nervous system. Several loci of FGF-5 expression could be localized by in situ hybridization and include portions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Neuronal expression accounts for at least some of the FGF-5 RNA synthesized in the central nervous system.\r"

Throughout cortical development, these channels exhibit voltage-dependent Mg2+ blockade and are antagonized by D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. The activation in situ of these nonsynaptic NMDA channels demonstrates a potential physiological substrate for control of early neuronal differentiation.\r"
