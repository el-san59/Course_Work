At the plaque surface, there were two patterns of fibrin distribution. Type I, suggesting a lumen thrombus, was found in 7 specimens. Type II, suggesting an intraplaque hemorrhage at the lumen surface, was found in 15 specimens. These changes were not significantly associated with the presence of ischemic symptoms or the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. All specimens with Type I change had arteriographic evidence of at least 70% diameter stenosis. The frequent lack of fibrin at the plaque surface suggests that there may be inherent limitations of standard medical treatment for carotid artery disease.\r"

However, it wears off shortly after suturing is complete and patients may experience pain after closure of the wound. We conducted a study to determine the degree of anesthesia obtained during and after repair of lacerations using lidocaine 1% versus bupivacaine 0.25%, a long-acting local anesthetic. Lidocaine and bupivacaine were administered in a double-blind, randomized fashion to 104 patients. Each patient was asked to rate his pain on a 0 to 10 scale (0, no pain; 10, severe pain) prior to administration of the anesthetic. They then rated pain on an identical scale at 30 minutes, and one, two, three, four, five, six, 12, 18, and 24 hours after completion of suturing. The mean baseline pain was 2.96 for the lidocaine group and 3.07 for the bupivacaine group. This decreased to less than 1.0 in both groups 30 minutes after infiltration. It remained low for the bupivacaine group for the next five hours, but increased almost to preanesthesia levels by two hours in the lidocaine group. A three-way analysis of variance revealed a significant difference (P less than .001) between the pain response of the two groups. There was no statistical difference (P greater than .05) between the age of the patients, size of laceration, and amount of drug used. The study shows that patients do experience pain after a wound is sutured and the anesthetic has worn off. It also demonstrates that bupivacaine significantly reduces the pain a patient may experience after repair of a wound.\r"

We have long been supporting a complex EMS system based on a hope for its effectiveness, rather than concrete proof. The data we need are not currently available. To make any scientific conclusions, we must have data generated from well-controlled, prospective, randomized studies. This involves a question of ethics. There exists a strong general feeling that randomizing prehospital care is unethical. We have reached a point where full resuscitative effort at the scene is not only expected by the general public, but anything less is considered inadequate by much of the medical community. Nevertheless, because the true influence of prehospital treatment is unknown, shouldn't the patient also be given the benefit of not receiving on-site stabilization effort in view of its potential harm? Prospective randomized studies undoubtedly will invite criticism. However, this is the only way to generate any meaningful conclusions. The essential questions remain unanswered. Can criticality be reliably assessed in the field, and if so, will advanced life support serve to reduce this criticality, or only further delay appropriate care?\r"

A positive response to the methacholine challenge test was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decline in FEV1 during the test. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with a positive methacholine response (p less than 0.001). Logistic regression analyses indicated that there was a significant association between a positive response to methacholine and both any wheeze (p = 0.002) and persistent wheeze (p less than 0.001) after taking into account smoking status and age; an association between responsiveness and chronic cough was of borderline significance (p = 0.06). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that positive methacholine responsiveness was independently associated with lower levels of FEV1 (p less than 0.001) and FEF25-75 (p less than 0.001). Using the log of the dose-response slope rather than a dichotomous variable to characterize responder status yielded very similar results in the linear and logistic models. The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that increased level of nonspecific responsiveness is significantly associated with wheeze and cough symptoms and decreased levels of pulmonary function in adult men. Longitudinal follow-up of these men should shed light on the importance of nonspecific responsiveness as a risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "Elastase activity directed against lung extracellular matrix is currently believed to be important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema. Although human alveolar macrophages degrade elastin when in direct contact with this substrate in vitro, studies of free elastase activity in medium conditioned by human alveolar macrophages have yielded variable results. As human alveolar macrophages secrete the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), an inhibitor of collagenase and of other connective-tissue-derived mammalian metalloproteinases, we speculated that this inhibitor's effects might extend to macrophage elastase. Using metalloproteinase elastase from the murine macrophagelike cell line P388D1, we observed that human alveolar macrophage conditioned medium inhibits metalloproteinase elastase and that this inhibitory activity could be blocked by specific antibody to TIMP. Alpha 2-macroglobulin, another proteinase inhibitor secreted by alveolar macrophages, also inhibited metalloproteinase elastase, but its inhibitory capacity was not blocked by antibody to TIMP. Because detergents are often included in elastase assays, we examined the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Buffers containing SDS and SDS-treated elastin were found to exert diverse effects on metalloproteinase elastase, TIMP, and alpha 2-macroglobulin activities, including a marked inhibition of metalloproteinase elastase activity by SDS-containing buffers. These findings suggest that detection of secreted metalloproteinase elastase activity by human alveolar macrophages is complicated by the concomitant release by these cells of inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and that assay conditions can markedly influence the results.\r"

It is unclear, however, if PMN-derived oxidants directly enhance proteolysis of extracellular matrix by neutrophil elastase. Matrix was produced by neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells and pulse-labeled with 3H-lysine to allow identification of the collagen-specific amino acid, hydroxylysine (3H-HL), and the elastin specific amino acid, desmosine (3H-DES). The smooth muscle cells were lysed, and the remaining matrix was used as a culture surface and a proteolytic substrate for intact PMN and purified neutrophil elastase. Proteolysis of collagen and elastin were quantified by chromatographic separation of the marker amino acids 3H-HL and 3H-DES, which were released into the supernatant or remained in the matrix after a 3-h incubation at 37 degrees C. The peptide, formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP), produced more rapid release of myeloperoxidase than did phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which produced more release of O2- and H2O2 than did FMLP. The percent release of total matrix 3H-DES in the presence of PMN + FMLP was 2.45 +/- 0.19% (mean +/- SE, n = 6) and with PMN + PMA it was 1.32 +/- 0.1% (n = 6, p less than 0.01). The release of matrix 3H-HL did not differ. Neutrophil cytoplasts, which produced O-2 and H2O2 but lacked azurophilic granules, did not significantly enhance either elastin or collagen degradation by purified neutrophil elastase (NE).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87239699\r", 
  ".W": "Many inflammatory mediators (histamine, prostanoids, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, adenosine, bradykinin, and sensory neuropeptides) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and produce their effects by activating specific cell surface receptors. Activation of these receptors may result in contraction of airway smooth muscle, mucus and fluid secretion, microvascular leakiness, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, and neuronal activation, indicating that the receptors are localized to a variety of cells. Recent studies have indicated that mediator receptor activation may lead to a response either by modulating adenylate cyclase or by stimulating breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides, which release intracellular calcium ions. The latter mechanism appears to predominate, at least in the case of airway smooth muscle receptors. Several receptors for inflammatory mediators have been characterized functionally and by direct receptor binding techniques, and receptor subtypes have been recognized. Several specific mediator receptor antagonists have been developed but are unlikely to have a major clinical effect because so many different mediators are likely to contribute to the pathology of asthma. Platelet-activating factor, possibly by acting on specific platelet receptors, is able to increase nonspecific bronchial responsiveness in human subjects, so it is possible that specific receptor antagonists of this phospholipid mediator might reduce the enhanced responsiveness to other inflammatory mediators which occurs in asthma.\r"

Mast cells may be activated directly (e.g., by specific antigen) or indirectly (e.g., by an epithelial cell product such as 15-HETE). When activated, the mast cell releases mediators that may have direct effects or indirect effects. Mast cells and mediators undoubtedly play a role in specific airway responses. The data presented here are intended to serve only as examples of the complex way in which various cells and inflammatory mediators may interact to produce a physiologic response in the airways. Possibilities exist for numerous interactions between additional mediators as well as additional cell types. Because of the complexity of the system, characterization of activation and secretion by isolated pure cells, and studies of cell-to-cell interactions in vitro appear to be important first steps toward understanding the even more complex interactions that occur in vivo.\r"

Design: Single-arm prospective trial. Setting: Comprehensive cancer treatment center serving the entire population of British Columbia. Patients: Consecutive enrollment of 78 patients ranging in age from 21 to 82 years (median, 64) with limited-stage (no B symptoms, Ann Arbor stage I or II, tumors less than 10 cm in diameter), diffuse large cell, mixed or immunoblastic histologic characteristics of malignant lymphoma seen at our institution between May 1980 and December 1984. All eligible patients were evaluated for response and relapse-free and overall survival. Interventions: Chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) for three cycles followed by involved field radiation therapy to the original site of disease in a dose equivalent to 3000 cGy in ten fractions. Main Results: The complete response rate was 99% (77 of 78 patients). With a median follow-up off treatment of 30 months the actuarial relapse-free survival is 84% and the overall survival is 85%. No deaths due to toxicity occurred. Conclusions: Brief chemotherapy and involved field radiation therapy is highly successful treatment for patients with limited-stage, histologically aggressive malignant lymphoma. Toxicity of this approach is acceptable, even in the elderly. Staging laparotomy is not needed to select these patients. Future trials should incorporate more effective chemotherapy programs.\r"

The more invasive methods of venous sampling and selective angiography have also been refined, but they have not been used as extensively because of the need for highly skilled personnel. The role of these diagnostic tools before surgery in the routine evaluation of patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism is unclear because a skilled surgeon should be able to achieve cures in 90% of these patients during exploratory surgery. However, most physicians would agree that, in those patients whose abnormalities go undetected during exploratory surgery of the neck, diagnostic imaging methods should be used before additional surgery is planned. Further prospective studies are needed to determine if routine localization before surgery is cost effective.\r"

Computed tomography of the brain frequently showed hypodense, nonenhancing white matter lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than computed tomography in detecting lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroencephalography were nondiagnostic. Impaired cell-mediated immunity was typically noted, even in the absence of other immunodeficiency-associated illnesses. Death occurred within 10 days to 18 months of the onset of symptoms in 22 patients. However, 4 patients remain alive at 3 to 23 months; of these 4, 2 have had significant improvement without treatment. Various therapies were unsuccessful.\r"

Radioimmunoassay of human cerebral arteries, removed at autopsy, revealed that the levels of the four peptides did not differ among the major cerebral arteries. There was, however, a gradual decline in peptide concentrations with increasing age of the patients, as measured in the proximal part of the middle cerebral artery. Pharmacological experiments on fresh segments of cerebral (pial) arteries in vitro revealed that neuropeptide Y caused vasoconstriction per se but did not potentiate the contractile response of noradrenaline. VIP, peptide histidine methionine-27 (PHM-27), SP, neurokinin A (NKA), and human CGRP potently relaxed vessels precontracted by prostaglandin F2 alpha, the relative potency being human CGRP greater than SP greater than VIP greater than NKA greater than PHM-27. The amount of relaxation varied between 55% (SP) and 96% (human CGRP) of the prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced contraction. The peptide effects were not antagonized by propranolol, atropine, or cimetidine, suggesting an action that does not involve adrenergic, cholinergic, or histaminergic receptors.\r"

In adult rat muscle, N-CAM is concentrated near neuromuscular junctions and on satellite cells, but is nearly undetectable in nonsynaptic portions of myofibers. However, N-CAM is abundant throughout myofibers in denervated and regenerating muscles. Using affinity-purified antibodies to N-CAM, we were able to demonstrate a similar distribution and regulation of N-CAM in human muscle. Myofiber N-CAM was not detectable immunohistochemically in any of 10 normal biopsies or in 4 biopsies that were abnormal but showed no evidence of fiber denervation or regeneration. N-CAM was present, however, at end plates, nerves, and satellite cells in normal human muscle. In contrast, myofiber N-CAM was detected in 16 of 16 patients with histological evidence of denervation and in 10 of 10 patients who had myopathy with degenerating/regenerating myofibers. In addition, 2 of 2 histologically nondiagnostic biopsies from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis contained N-CAM-positive myofibers. Immunoblot analysis also detected N-CAM in denervated and myopathic, but not normal, human muscle. These results suggest that N-CAM may play a role in muscle reinnervation or regeneration and that N-CAM immunohistochemistry may complement conventional techniques in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disease.\r"

The causal relationships between biochemical and neuroanatomical abnormalities and those of nodal membrane function are not known. Nodal clamp examinations were carried out in the sciatic nerve of diabetic BB-rats to elucidate the events underlying diabetic nerve dysfunctions and how these relate to metabolic and structural defects of diabetic nerve. With increasing duration of diabetes, there was a progressive decline in nodal action potentials attributable to decreased Na+ permeability and a decrease in the membranous Na+ gradient. Vigorous insulin therapy in short-term (6-week) diabetic BB-rats normalized the Na+-permeability defect and the membranous Na+ gradient. These defects did not reverse in long-term (24-week) diabetic animals subjected to the same treatment. This poorly reversible nodal dysfunction accounts for the not readily reversible conduction defect in chronic diabetes and is probably directly related to irreversible axoglial dysjunction.\r"

Nocturnal hypoglycaemia (less than 3.0 mmol/l) occurred in 24 of 71 (34%) children on twice daily insulin and in three of 31 (10%) children on once daily insulin. Predictive value modelling showed that a blood glucose concentration of less than 7 mmol/l at 2200 h was the best predictor of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, with a sensitivity of 63%, specificity of 94%, and positive and negative predictive values of 83%. Blood glucose measurement at 0800 h had no predictive value for nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The mean (SD) glycosylated haemoglobin concentration of children on twice daily insulin who had nocturnal hypoglycaemia was 55 (8) mmol HMF/mol Hb, which was significantly less than that of children on twice daily insulin who did not have hypoglycaemia (64 (11) mmol HMF/mol Hb) or those on once daily insulin (62 (11) mmol HMF/mol Hb). A controlled trial was then performed in which 29 children with diabetes who had a blood glucose concentration at 2200 h of less than 7 mmol/l measured by Reflocheck were randomised into two groups, one of which received 10 g carbohydrate supplement and the other of which did not. Thirteen of the 14 children in the control group had hypoglycaemia at 0200 h, whereas the snack prevented hypoglycaemia in 12 of 15 in the test group. Blood glucose values in the two groups at 0800 h were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study tested our hypothesis that meaningful plasma reference ranges could be established for preterm infants by a simple correction of patient age at sampling date for gestational age deficit at birth. Using a modified radioimmunoassay kit method, determinations of alpha fetoprotein were performed on capillary and venous blood samples collected from 56 babies aged from birth to 5 months with gestational ages ranging from 26 weeks to 43 weeks. Unmodified plasma alpha fetoprotein values were grouped according to patient age and examined statistically using established normal theory methods, but these yielded excessively wide reference intervals and non-Gaussian distribution parameters. Acceptable reference ranges were derived using logarithmic transformation of plasma alpha fetoprotein values and rearrangement against patient age corrected for gestational age deficit. These provisional reference ranges for plasma alpha fetoprotein in preterm (and term) infants are applied to groups of previously meaningless alpha fetoprotein results and used to test the potential usefulness of plasma alpha fetoprotein determination as a diagnostic marker in biliary atresia, hepatitis, and yolk sac derived tumours.\r"

This difference became more significant (p less than 0.001) at each 3-month interval through 3 years, when patients who had VBGPs had lost 37 +/- 20% of excess weight compared with 64 +/- 19% for patients who had RYGBPs. The members of the groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, eating habits, morbidity rates before surgery, ideal body weight, and weight before surgery. Although there was no significant difference between the loss of excess weight in \"sweets eaters\" (69 +/- 17%) or \"non-sweets eaters\" (67 +/- 17%) after RYGBP at 1 year, \"sweets eaters\" who had VBGPs lost significantly less excess weight (36 +/- 13%) than did \"non-sweets eaters\" who had VBGPs (57 +/- 18%), p less than 0.02, or \"sweets eaters\" who had RYGBPs, p less than 0.0001. No significant differences were noted for electrolytes, renal or liver function tests, and most vitamins between patients who had VBGPs and RYGBPs; however, patients who had RYGBPs had lower (p less than 0.05) serum vitamin B12 levels (286 +/- 149 pg/dl) than did patients who had VBGPs (461 +/- 226 pg/dl) at 2 years. By 3 years, the vitamin B12 levels were equal in members of the two groups. Five patients who had RYGBPs required endoscopic stomal dilatation for stomal stenosis and one had a marginal ulcer develop, which responded to cimetidine. RYGBP was clearly superior to VBGP for \"sweets eaters,\" probably because of the development of dumping syndrome symptoms. However, RYGBP was associated with a larger number of correctable problems. Thus, it is important to evaluate a patient's eating habits before surgery for morbid obesity; \"non-sweets eaters\" probably should be treated with VBGP and \"sweets eaters\" with RYGBP.\r"

Seventeen of 25 patients are alive 3-24 months after transplantation. Evidence of rejection was seen in each patient. Twelve patients had mild, easily controlled rejection; 13 patients had severe rejection averaging 3.1 episodes per patient. The initial immunosuppressive regimen included cyclosporine and prednisone. To decrease complications related to high dose steroids, azathioprine has recently been added to our maintenance regimen to lessen steroid requirements. Acute rejection episodes were treated with 500-1000 mg of methylprednisolone for 3 days; antithymocyte globulin or the murine monoclonal antibody, OKT3, was added for severe or resistant rejection episodes. Three patients died of rejection, and two patients died of infection. Seventeen of 18 survivors are New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I; 15 patients have returned to employment or full activity. Because of new developments in support of transplant candidates and treatment of complications, as well as the introduction of cyclosporine, orthotopic cardiac transplantation has become an effective treatment for end-stage heart disease.\r"

Vein size was determined from completion angiograms, and wound complications recorded and compared with patients who had similar procedures in the 12 months before the use of vein mapping. Preoperative mapping was found to be accurate in 50 to 51 patients (98%). Vein size as determined by B-mode ultrasound correlated well with angiograms, R = 0.8539 overall with R greater than 0.9 in the last 7 months of the study. Wound complications occurred in 2% of the patients who had preoperative mapping and in 17% of the historic controls. Preoperative vein mapping using B-mode ultrasound is an accurate method of determining vein suitability for use in arterial reconstruction. It improves operative planning and can contribute to a reduction in wound complications. Veins determined to be unusable by preoperative scanning need not be explored.\r"

Since July, 1983, 61 patients (50 male and 11 female) have undergone orthotopic cardiac transplantation for cardiomyopathy (48 patients), ischemic heart disease (11), or congenital heart disease (2). Mean age was 39 years (range, 1.5 to 57 years). Median hospital stay was 26 days (range, 4 to 60 days). Maintenance immunosuppression consisted primarily of prednisone and cyclosporine; it was modified in 9 patients because of a pre-existing clinical condition. The incidence of rejection was 0.44 episode/patient-month within 3 months of cardiac transplantation and 0.10 episode/patient-month subsequently. The incidence of infection was 0.05 episode/patient-month. Major side effects of cyclosporine included renal dysfunction (63%) and hypertension (61%). No recipient required dialysis for renal dysfunction. Ten patients died (rejection, 4; infection, 3; carcinoma, 1; lymphoma, 1; and pulmonary hemorrhage, 1); actuarial survival at 1 and 2 years was 84 +/- 6% and 76 +/- 8%, respectively. Patient follow-up (cumulative, 719 patient-months) revealed that 96% of recipients were rehabilitated and 50% had returned to work. With increasing understanding of cyclosporine immunosuppression, recipients can continue to look forward to an extended life with nearly complete rehabilitation.\r"

The Senning procedure was largely abandoned when Mustard's technique was introduced in 1964, but has enjoyed a resurgence as a number of its potential advantages became more fully appreciated. Today, patients with TGA are increasingly undergoing repair by the arterial switch technique. Not all patients, however, are suitable candidates for this approach, and its success will be measured against the ingenious procedure described by Senning more than a quarter of a century ago.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical course of 20 patients with 22 thoracic hydatid cysts operated on from 1957 to 1984, was reviewed. Follow-up extended to 27 years (mean, 11.6 +/- 1.5 years [+/- the standard error of the mean]) and was 90% complete. Most patients originated from countries in the Mediterranean region; 5 were native Canadians. The diagnosis was suspected in all but 3 patients preoperatively. Fourteen patients had 16 primary lung cysts, 4 had infected liver cysts with intrathoracic extension, 1 had synchronous unruptured liver and lung cysts, and 1 had a thymic cyst. Nine cysts were intact, whereas 13 had ruptured preoperatively. A variety of surgical procedures was performed, including eight wedge resections and nine lobectomies. There were no early deaths, and perioperative complications were infrequent. One patient with a hepatic cyst that had ruptured into the right pleural space and right lower lobe died at 7 months of massive echinococcosis of the liver and intraabdominal sepsis. There has been no evidence of thoracic recurrence in any of our long-term survivors, although 1 patient had undergone enucleation of a left lung cyst in Greece 15 years prior to her reoperation here for a lingular recurrence. We conclude that thoracic hydatid disease is a rare entity in northeastern North America. The prevalence of ruptured cysts and infected hepatic cysts involving the lung was higher than in most other series, thereby necessitating more aggressive surgical treatment. Nevertheless, morbidity was low, and recurrence of disease was uncommon in long-term follow-up.\r"

Moreover, eight subjects with the highest PRA values exhibited the same magnitude of decrease in diastolic blood pressure as did the low PRA group (15.0 +/- 4.2 vs 13.6 +/- 1.6, respectively). This study thus provides no evidence for increased sensitivity to diuretic therapy among patients with low-renin essential hypertension.\r"

After four weeks of placebo, patients were randomly allocated to increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride for 12 weeks using a parallel, double-blind study design. Both hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride significantly reduced mean (+/- SEM) baseline supine and standing blood pressure (171 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 and 167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 mm Hg) to 148 +/- 2/84 +/- 1 and 146 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively, at week 16. Amiloride did not exert any additional antihypertensive effect. Only eight patients required hydrochlorothiazide at 100 mg/d, with the remainder responding to 25 to 50 mg/d. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased mean serum potassium level from 4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L (4.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) during placebo to 4.0 +/- 0.1 mEq/L (4.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) at week 16. Ten patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide developed hypokalemia compared with only two receiving hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride. Relatively low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 50 mg/d) effectively reduce blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients. Hypokalemia may occur with hydrochlorothiazide alone but is much less common when hydrochlorothiazide is combined with amiloride.\r"

In addition, a significant correlation existed between the plasma blood pressure. Finally, the greater the plasma glucose insulin response to oral glucose and both systolic and diastolic and insulin responses to oral glucose, the lower the plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations, and the higher the ratio of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus, abnormalities of plasma glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism exist in patients with untreated hypertension, and these changes may contribute to the increased risk for coronary artery disease associated with hypertension.\r"

Abnormal laboratory and radiological studies (ultrasound, biliary scintigraphy) were not significantly different in the two groups and had a low positive predictive value for detection of acute biliary disease. Nevertheless, normal biliary scintigraphy had high negative predictive value in that, if normal, it gave assurance that the cystic duct was patent and unnecessary surgery could be obviated in this high-risk category of patients.\r"

Asymptomatic, obese, insulin-treated patients were given diet and diabetes education and, in half of these patients, insulin therapy was withdrawn. Over six months, patients developing hyperglycemic symptoms or acetonemia were counted as study failures. Failure criteria developed in 13 of 25 insulin-withdrawal patients, at a median of four weeks after withdrawal, compared with two of 24 control subjects. Elevated stimulated glucose levels predicted the need for insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia worsened in insulin-withdrawal patients who did not meet study failure criteria, but it improved in control patients. Study patients were insulin deficient as shown by low baseline C peptide values (0.43 +/- 0.05 nmol/L). The prompt metabolic decompensation precipitated by insulin withdrawal suggests that insulin-deficient patients may benefit from insulin therapy and may need it to prevent symptomatic hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of the glucose-induced insulin release on peripheral substrate metabolism, we studied muscle metabolism in seven patients after elective surgery and in four healthy volunteers combining the forearm and the euglycemic glucose clamp technique (insulin infusion, 0.2 mU/kg per minute). Arterial and deep venous concentrations of substrates and hormones were determined in the basal period and during steady state of the infusion period. After 90 minutes of insulin infusion, the whole-body glucose infusion rate was significantly lower in patients who had elective surgery, although plasma insulin concentrations were comparable. In both groups this was related to a reduced supply of free fatty acids and ketones in muscle. In controls the resulting lack of substrates in muscle appeared to be compensated by an enhanced uptake of glucose, not seen in the patients who had elective surgery. Surprisingly, as indicated by the significantly reduced lactate production (-0.15 +/- 0.05 vs -0.62 +/- 0.32 mumol/100 g per minute basal), in this group the glucose taken up was oxidized aerobically to a greater extent. However, the total resulting energy gain was small. Thus, a peripheral energy deficit might arise favoring increased oxidation of amino acids. To avoid this undesired side effect, only those substrates should be administered that minimize pancreatic insulin release.\r"

Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy has been used in the past with unfavorable outcome. With advances in clinical and radiologic assessment and new knowledge of the pathophysiology of brain ischemia, thrombolytic therapy has now become a feasible pharmacologic intervention in acute stroke. Central nervous system hemorrhage, the most dreaded complication of fibrinolytic therapy, is rare in patients with acute myocardial infarction favorably treated with these agents. Risk of hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic cerebral infarcts is related to size, location, and age of patient. Anticoagulation therapy may increase its size, but not its likelihood. The development of clot-specific agents, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator, and careful patient selection make fibrinolytic therapy safe and potentially effective in acute stroke.\r"

This article reviews the natural history of aneurysmal SAH, and examines the current therapeutic strategies that have been suggested to improve the outcome. Careful evaluation of the existing data suggests that early aneurysm surgery and aggressive postoperative volume expansion therapy constitute the best presently available approach to patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "Cartilage samples from both the immediate and remote lesion areas were obtained from the tibial plateaus of 21 patients with osteoarthritis, and were subjected to histologic and enzymatic study. There was a frequent loss of pericellular metachromatic staining in the OA cartilage. Seven patients had received intraarticular injections of steroids, and in 21% of those cartilage samples, a pericellular halo was seen. This halo was seen in 71% of patients who had not received steroid injections. The total acid metalloprotease activity was increased more than twofold in specimens from OA lesions and in those samples graded moderate, as compared with age-matched control cartilages. These differences were greater when the specimens from patients who had received steroid therapy were excluded from the data. The cartilage specimens from steroid-treated patients were not significantly different from those of controls with respect to the enzyme activity in the lesions or in cartilage with moderate disease. The active form of the protease was suppressed by steroids. In samples from patients who did not receive steroid injections and who had a moderate grade of OA, a significantly elevated level of the active protease was present, as compared with control samples. Those samples graded moderate which came from patients who received steroid treatments showed no difference in the active protease level versus that of controls. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that acid metalloprotease activity is involved in the degradation of the cartilage matrix in OA. Since the protease retains a significant fraction (40%) of its activity at neutral pH, its physiologic role might occur either at acid pH or at neutral pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the plan depends on the validity of this assumption, many patients may be unable (or unwilling) to fill their prescriptions. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of and reasons for noncompliance in filling prescriptions among patients discharged from the emergency department and to determine if differences in compliance exist among various socioeconomic groups. Ninety-six consecutive patients who had been given prescriptions at discharge from the emergency department were contacted by telephone the following day to determine if their prescriptions had been filled and if not, the reasons for not filling them. Patients were stratified by payor classification groups as follows: insured by third-party payor (53 patients), covered by Medicaid (19 patients), noninsured \"self-paying\", (14 patients), covered by Medicare (four patients), and unknown payor status, (six patients). The percentages in each group who had not filled their prescriptions by follow-up the next day were as follows: insured, 21%; Medicaid, 21%; self-paying, 21%; Medicare, 25%; unknown, 50%. Differences between groups were not significant. The following reasons were given for not having filled prescriptions: insufficient funds, 36%; lack of transportation or assistance, 14%; negligence, 32%; and miscellaneous, 18%.

Routinely administered to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of many drugs, growing evidence indicates that repeated doses of charcoal also may enhance drug elimination. Some drugs are excreted into the bile or gastric fluids (phencyclidine, digoxin) and are reabsorbed. Other drugs (theophylline, phenobarbital) can diffuse from the plasma into the lumen of the GI tract. Activated charcoal is administered at regular intervals to sequester these toxins in the GI tract, eventually causing their excretion in feces. This article reviews the evidence for the safety and efficacy of repetitive charcoal therapy. While supportive management remains the mainstay of therapy in poisoned patients, activated charcoal is inexpensive, effective, simple to administer, and may obviate the need for more invasive methods of toxin removal.\r"

During the placebo and amiodarone phases of the study left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index determined by first pass radionuclide ventriculography were similar, both at rest and during upright bicycle exercise. Exercise induced ventricular tachycardia was abolished and simple and complex ventricular arrhythmias observed on 24 hour ambulatory monitoring were greatly diminished during amiodarone treatment. Three patients died, all suddenly, during the placebo phase. In two patients amiodarone was withdrawn after a further myocardial infarction in one and a worsening of symptoms of ventricular arrhythmia in the other. In contrast with other antiarrhythmic agents amiodarone is effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure without causing adverse haemodynamic effects. Because frequent ventricular arrhythmias are known to be associated with a poor prognosis in heart failure, these data suggest that amiodarone may improve the poor prognosis in patients with heart failure.\r"

No significant bony abnormalities were detected. We believe that the available evidence does not warrant alarm, and that long-term etretinate therapy can probably be given with a low risk of musculoskeletal toxicity if certain precautions are taken, in particular the use of low maintenance dose levels, early investigation of symptoms of musculoskeletal pain or stiffness, and regular 99mTcMDP bone scans.\r"

The methods were applied to epithelial cells grown from explants of normal skin and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and to fibroblasts from normal skin, hypertrophic scar and keloid. In normal keratinocytes the number of peroxidase-positive cells was higher than the number incorporating [3H]-thymidine, because of the presence of labelled cells in the centre of the explants in the former. The epithelial cells from BCC gave a mean (+/- SD) of 4.9 +/- 1.2% peroxidase-positive cells, while no cells were labelled with [3H]-thymidine. In dermal fibroblasts from normal skin and hypertrophic scar the percentages of peroxidase-positive cells did not differ significantly from the [3H]-thymidine labelling indices. The immunological method has advantages over [3H]-thymidine autoradiography in that it avoids radioactive material and the proportion of cells labelled by the two methods is the same.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen (11%) of 146 consecutive patients with severe aplastic anemia prepared for engraftment with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) rejected marrow grafts from their HLA-identical siblings. They were given a second marrow transplant from either the same (n = 13) or a second (n = 3) HLA-identical sibling between 23 and 743 (median 86) days after the first transplant. The preparation for the second transplant included cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg, on each of four successive days. Twelve hours after each of the first three doses of cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, 30 mg/kg/dose, was infused. One of the 16 patients died from infection too early after the second transplant to be evaluated, two had failure of engraftment and died with infection, one rejected the second graft and is surviving almost 5 years later with full autologous marrow recovery, and 12 had successful and sustained second grafts. Of these 12, six are surviving between 11 months and 7 3/4 years. Four of the six have no graft-v-host disease (GVHD), while two have chronic GVHD requiring treatment. Five have Karnofsky scores of 100% and one of 90%. Six of the 12 patients with sustained grafts died between 63 days and 38 months after transplantation, four with infections (related in two patients to chronic GVHD), one with acute GVHD, and one with hemorrhage. The average interval from first to second transplant was 308 days during the past five years, compared to 61 days in earlier patients. Five of seven recent patients are surviving, compared to two of nine earlier patients. In conclusion, successful second transplants after cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin are possible in most patients with aplastic anemia who have rejected their first marrow grafts; however, mortality remains high, with only 40% of the patients becoming long-term survivors.\r"

  ".U": "87242914\r", 
  ".W": "In order to determine whether antigenic patterns alter with disease progression and are thereby suggestive of impending blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia, 50 bone marrow biopsy specimens from 32 patients were examined retrospectively using indirect immunoperoxidase labeling with three monoclonal antibodies that detect myeloid antigens. Monoclonal antibodies PMN13F6, PMN7C3, and PMN8C7 detect human neutrophil antigens that first appear at the myeloblast, promyelocyte, and metamyelocyte stages of differentiation, respectively, and persist throughout later differentiation. Percentages of antigen-positive bone marrow cells during the chronic phase were compared with percentages of antigen-positive cells at blast transformation, and time from bone marrow biopsy until blast crisis was correlated with the percentage of bone marrow cells expressing these antigens. Bone marrow biopsy samples from patients in the chronic phase who continue to remain clinically stable 4 to 106 months after biopsy expressed PMN13F6 antigen on 82% +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) of cells, PMN7C3 antigen on 62% +/- 14% of cells, and PMN8C7 on 68% +/- 14% of cells. Bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from patients 1 or more years prior to blast transformation expressed PMN13F6 antigen on 81% +/- 12%, PMN7C3 antigen on 71% +/- 16%, and PMN8C7 on 64% +/- 16% of cells. Bone marrow biopsy samples obtained between 2 months and 1 year prior to blast crisis expressed PMN13F6 antigen on 68% +/- 15%, PMN7C3 on 51% +/- 17%, and PMN8C7 antigen on 46% +/- 18% of cells. Bone marrow biopsy specimens taken at the time of blast transformation expressed PMN13F6 antigen on 20% +/- 25%, PMN7C3 antigen on 19% +/- 25%, and PMN8C7 antigen on 13% +/- 25% of cells. The difference between the mean of antigen-positive cells from bone marrow biopsy samples obtained at the time of blast crisis was significant compared with the mean of positive cells from biopsy specimens obtained at all other phases of the disease (P less than .001 for all three antibodies). There was a positive correlation between loss of myeloid antigens and disease progression as determined by simple regression of log time and correlation analysis (PMN13F6, r = .6533, P less than .005; PMN7C8, r = .6304, P less than .005; PMN8C7, r = .5215, P less than .05). There was a negative correlation between percentage of immature cells and time to blastic crisis (r = -.6206, P less than .005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In each patient the mutation was present in a different beta globin gene framework, defined by intragenic restriction site polymorphisms, thereby suggesting the occurrence of independent mutations. The study of the RNA products of one of these cloned genes, after transfer and transient expression in HeLa cells, showed partial inactivation of the normal donor splice site of IVS-1 and activation of two major and one minor cryptic splice sites. Only one of the two major cryptic sites was utilized in a cell-free splicing extract. The effects of this mutation on messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing are similar to that of another beta thalassemia gene with a G to C transition at the same position.\r"

The surface expression of the epitope recognized by this autoantibody, 5E5, increases with time as platelets age in vitro, suggesting that it may represent a senescence or activation-specific antigen. 5E5 binds to the purified platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In an immunoblot technique, 5E5 binds to a protein with an apparent mol wt of 95,000, which is identical to that of GPIIIa under nonreduced conditions. In crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), the predominant antigen recognized by 5E5 is contained in the GPIIb-IIIa precipitin arc. An additional precipitin arc recognized by 5E5 is often observed only on gels derived from lysates of platelets stored under blood bank conditions for greater than 3 days. These findings illustrate the usefulness of human monoclonal antibodies for the identification of membrane neoantigens expressed as a result of platelet activation or revealed as platelets age in vitro.\r"

In addition, the immunologic marker patterns of the Reed-Sternberg cells were determined. Rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes were detected in tissues from five patients, particularly in late stages of the disease when lymphocyte depletion had occurred. No rearrangements of T cell receptor genes were found. The results indicate that clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements can be detected in tissues involved by Hodgkin's disease.\r"

They were present mainly in peripheral blood under normal conditions but accumulated in T zones of lymph nodes with nonspecific T-zone hyperplasia, where numerous interdigitating reticulum cells existed. In healthy adults approximately 1% to 4% (mean 3.4%) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were S-100 beta+ T cells. The proportion of S-100 beta+ T cells in peripheral blood tended to significantly decrease (less than 0.5%) in patients with neoplastic diseases; this tendency was apparently related to tumor progression.\r"

  ".W": "Repeated transfusions with platelets from randomly selected donors lead to HLA alloimmunization in about 50% of patients due to lymphocyte contamination of platelet concentrates. Attempts to remove the leukocytes from the platelet concentrates by additional centrifugation steps led to substantial loss of platelets. We report a new procedure for removal of almost all leukocytes with excellent platelet recoveries. Single donor concentrates are treated with 50 ng/mL prostacyclin to inactivate the platelets transiently. The concentrates are then passed through a cellulose-acetate filter to remove the leukocytes. In 30 concentrates this treatment reduced the contamination by leukocytes to less than 0.1 million per concentrate with a platelet recovery of 89% +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM). Thirty filtered platelet concentrates transfused to ten thrombocytopenic patients within one hour after filtration were well tolerated and led to corrected count increments of (22.0 +/- 1.1) X 10(6)/mL blood after one hour and normal survival thereafter. In four of five patients these concentrates reduced the bleeding time. We conclude that transient inactivation of platelets by prostacyclin enables optimal removal of leukocytes and may help to reduce alloimmunization during frequent transfusions with platelet concentrates.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for the iron-binding protein lactoferrin. Lactoferrin acts as a potent inhibitor of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production when it binds to these cells. Using a rosette assay and immunofluorescence, we have shown that cultured leukemia cells, including the human erythroid leukemia cell line K562, also have lactoferrin binding sites. The number of binding sites on K562 cells was estimated using soluble 59Fe-lactoferrin. Inhibition studies demonstrate that lactoferrin binding sites are distinct and unrelated to receptors for transferrin or the Fc portion of IgG, which are present on K562 cells. However, electrostatic forces may be important for lactoferrin binding, since other polycationic proteins (eg, protamine) inhibit lactoferrin binding. Prior treatment of K562 cells with trypsin nearly abolishes lactoferrin binding. However, these cells recover their ability to bind lactoferrin when trypsin is removed. Unlike transferrin receptors, the expression of lactoferrin binding sites is not regulated by cellular iron status. Cytosine arabinoside arrests the proliferation of K562 cells and simultaneously leads to a reduction in lactoferrin surface binding, suggesting that lactoferrin binding may be dependent on cell proliferation.\r"

However, treatment of the bone marrow graft to eliminate residual tumor cells prior to reinfusion can delay the return of peripheral blood elements, presumably from damage to or loss of hematopoietic stem cells responsible for hematologic recovery. To develop a model predictive of hematologic recovery, we studied the progenitor cell contents of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (100 micrograms/mL)-purged bone marrow grafts of 40 consecutive patients undergoing autologous BMT at this center. Granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM) were grown from all grafts after treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent, but erythroid (BFU-E) and mixed (CFU-GEMM) colonies were grown from only 44% and 33% of the grafts respectively. The recovery of CFU-GM after purging ranged from 0.07% to 23%. The logarithm of CFU-GM content of the treated grafts was linearly correlated with the time to recovery of peripheral blood leukocytes (r = -0.80), neutrophils (r = -0.79), reticulocytes (r = -0.60), and platelets (r = -0.66). The CFU-GM content of purged autologous bone marrow grafts may reflect the hematopoietic stem cell content of the grafts and thus predict the rate of hematologic recovery in patients undergoing autologous BMT.\r"

In addition, immunogenotyping revealed the possibility of a second B cell clone within the patient's tumor. Development of a multiclonal lymphoma in this patient may relate to the carcinogenic effects of chemotherapy or to a predisposition for neoplastic transformation of lymphocytes due to a previously diagnosed autoimmune condition.

When 5 X 10(5) MEG-01 cells/mL was subcultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), the concentration of protein S antigen in the culture medium increased progressively with time from less than 8 ng/mL on day 0 to 105.6 +/- 6.0 ng/mL on day 13. Vitamin K2(1 microgram/mL) increased the production of functional protein S, whereas warfarin (1 microgram/mL) profoundly decreased the quantity and the specific activity of secreted protein S. By an indirect immunofluorescent technique, protein S antigen was detected in both MEG-01 cells and human bone marrow megakaryocytes. Immunoblot analysis of culture medium revealed two distinct bands (mol wt 84,000 and 78,000) that are identical to the doublets of purified plasma protein S. De novo synthesis of protein S was demonstrated by the presence of specific immunoprecipitable radioactivity in the medium after 5 hours of labeling of the cells with [35S]-methionine as a 84,000 mol wt protein. Plasma protein S levels of nine patients with severe aplastic anemia were not significantly different from those of normal controls. These results suggest that megakaryocytes produce functional protein S and contain the enzymes required for the carboxylation of selected glutamic acid residues, and that protein S synthesized by megakaryocytes does not represent a main source of plasma protein S.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets may become activated in a number of clinical disorders and participate in thrombus formation. We developed a direct test for activated platelets in whole blood using flow cytometry. Whole blood was incubated with either biotin-PAC1, a monoclonal antibody specific for the fibrinogen receptor on activated platelets, or biotin-S12, an antibody specific for an alpha-granule membrane protein that associates with the platelet surface during secretion. Platelet-bound antibodies were detected with streptavidin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE). Platelets were differentiated from the larger erythrocytes and WBCs by their light-scatter profile. Alternatively, platelets could be identified with FITC-AP1, an antibody specific for platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib, and analyzed further for PAC1 or S12 binding with PE-streptavidin. No centrifugation or washing steps were required. With gel-filtered platelets, there was a direct correlation between ADP-induced biotin-PAC1 binding and binding determined in a conventional 125I-PAC1 binding assay (r = .99; P less than .001). Furthermore, as few as 0.8% activated platelets could be detected by flow cytometry when activated platelets were mixed with unstimulated platelets. In whole blood, unstimulated platelets demonstrated no PAC1- or S12-specific fluorescence, indicating that they did not bind these antibodies. On stimulation with agonists, however, the platelets demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence similar to that observed for platelets in plasma or buffer. Low concentrations of ADP and epinephrine, which induce fibrinogen receptors but little secretion, stimulated near-maximal PAC1 binding but little S12 binding. On the other hand, a concentration of phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) that evokes full platelet aggregation and secretion induced maximal PAC1 and S12 binding. Activated platelets could also be analyzed in whole blood samples that had been fixed with paraformaldehyde. These studies demonstrate that activated platelets can be reliably detected in whole blood using activation-dependent monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. This technique may be useful to assess the degree of platelet activation and the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in clinical disorders.\r"

Four samples from unrelated individuals lacked an Xba I site, giving rise to a longer restriction fragment detectable by Southern analysis; two samples were from normal tissue, and two were from acute myelogenous leukemic blasts. Thus, no association could be found between the RFLP and disease among the individuals studied. Pedigree analysis of another cohort demonstrated Mendelian inheritance consistent with a somatic polymorphism.

As G-CSF induces differentiation and loss of tumorigenicity in myeloid leukemic cells or cell lines, it was possible that the translocation in APL involved the DNA of the G-CSF coding region or its regulatory region. In situ hybridization to chromosomes with the t(15;17) from patients with the APL translocation using a G-CSF cDNA clone revealed that the coding region of this gene is proximal to the t(15;17) breakpoint on chromosome 17. Southern analysis of DNA from patients with the APL translocation showed no differences in hybridization between normal and leukemic cells. These results indicate that the G-CSF coding sequence is not disrupted by the chromosomal rearrangement characteristic of APL.\r"

  ".W": "Acute myeloid leukemia colony forming cells (AML-CFU) require the addition of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) for in vitro proliferation. Recently, we isolated a human recombinant multilineage CSF (hMulti-CSF). We investigated the ability of hMulti-CSF to stimulate AML clonogenic cells in seven patients in direct comparison with the effects of human granulocyte CSF (hG-CSF), human granulocyte-macrophage CSF (hGM-CSF), and feeder leukocytes. We show that hMulti-CSF is an efficient stimulator of AML colony formation in four of seven cases. In these patients, hGM-CSF was also capable of stimulating AML colonies in vitro. In two of seven cases hMulti-CSF appeared to be a weak stimulus of AML-CFU proliferation. In these latter two cases, however, hG-CSF and in one case hGM-CSF effectively stimulated AML-CFU growth. In one patient none of the hCSFs, either alone or in combination, induced AML colony formation, whereas AML colonies consistently appeared in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) leukocyte feeder assay. This finding suggests that PHA stimulated leukocytes produce components other than the tested hCSFs that may have a role in the proliferation of AML cells in vitro. Multi-CSF, like hGM-CSF, revealed a limited capacity to induce progressive maturation during AML colony growth, ie, not beyond the promyelocytic stage. On the other hand, in one case, hG-CSF stimulated the growth of AML colonies containing (meta)myelocytes and granulocytes. We conclude that hMulti-CSF is a regulator of AML-CFU proliferation in a significant number of cases. The patterns of responsiveness of AML precursors to the three hCSFs in different patients show a striking variability, which may indicate that AML-CFU are the neoplastic representatives of normal bone marrow progenitors at different stages of maturation and with distinct CSF requirements.\r"

The anti-Id antibody identified IgM+/IgD+/lambda+ B cells as the predominant cell type of her CLL clone. In addition, substantial proportions of the IgG and IgA B cells and most of the IgM plasma cells in her bone marrow and blood were Id+. Six years after diagnosis, the patient died of respiratory failure due to infiltration of lungs by malignant cells. Autopsy revealed a dramatic change in the tumor cell morphology. The lungs, hilar nodes, and liver were infiltrated by a diffuse large cell lymphoma admixed with the leukemic cells. By immunohistologic staining these anaplastic lymphoma cells were IgM+/IgD-/lambda+ B cells expressing the same Id noted earlier on the CLL cells. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern on Southern blot analysis was also the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissues involved by the lymphoma. Thus, the combination of antiidiotype and immunoglobulin gene analyses in this patient with Richter's syndrome revealed that a CLL clone, seemingly \"frozen\" in differentiation, was actually undergoing isotype switching, differentiation into plasma cells, and evolution into a rapidly growing and fetal lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Resealed ghosts of human RBCs, containing diluted cytosol, are susceptible to invasion by Plasmodium falciparum. If ATP is present, a dilution of up to about 30-fold, corresponding to an intracellular hemoglobin concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL, can be tolerated without total loss of susceptibility to invasion. Up to a dilution of about one-half this, the parasites also develop normally. When the cytosol is diluted by more than the critical amount, invasion of the resulting resealed ghosts falls off abruptly. If the diluent buffer is replaced by extraneous concentrated hemolysate, an indefinite dilution is possible without loss of invasion. There is thus an intracellular constituent, which must be present at a concentration above some critical level if the parasite is to enter the cell. The factor in question is not dialyzable. It is largely inactivated when the hemolysate is kept for approximately 1 day in the cold or for approximately 20 minutes at 45 degrees C. The inability of a heat-treated hemolysate to support invasion is not due to the generation of inhibitory products, because such a solution can be used as a diluent of a fresh hemolysate without inhibition of invasion. When the inactivated hemolysate is present as a major component, however, the parasites fail to develop to the trophozoite stage. The invasion-linked factor remains in the strongly adsorbed nonheme fraction when a batchwise separation from hemoglobin on an anion exchanger is made and is thus probably acidic in character; the adsorbed fraction, recovered from the ion-exchanger, substantially restores capacity for invasion when sealed into ghosts. Its activity is destroyed by treatment with trypsin. The adsorbed fraction contains many proteins. When fractionated on a gel filtration column by fast liquid chromatography, active material eluted at a volume corresponding to a mol wt for a globular protein in the region of 10,000. A component of apparent subunit mol wt of 13,000 was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of this eluate fraction.\r"

Ninety percent of the cases of AML reacted with one or more of the pan-myeloid MoAb, My7, My9, or 20.3. Reactivity of the myeloid panel of MoAb showed some correlation with the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML. Five of six cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were HLA-DR negative; the one HLA-DR-positive APL had a minor population of HLA-DR-negative promyelocytes. OKM5 and/or My4 reacted with 16 of 16 monocytic leukemias. No specific marker of early erythroid development was identified. AP3, a MoAb reactive with platelet glycoprotein (GPIIIa), was specific for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Immunocytochemistry was also helpful in classifying seven cases of AML with equivocal or negative routine cytochemistry. Two cases of AML had minor populations of blasts detected by the APAAP technique that were immunologically distinct from the major blast population; these minor populations emerged as the predominant cell type at relapse. Two cases of ALL expressed multiple myeloid and lymphoid antigens. Two other cases that morphologically were ALL reacted with only myeloid MoAb; one consisted entirely of immature basophils on ultrastructural examination. Immunophenotyping results using the APAAP technique were comparable with those obtained with flow cytometry. The APAAP technique is a reliable method for immunophenotyping leukemia that complements other methods of immunologic evaluation. The primary advantages of this method include its use with routinely prepared blood and bone marrow smears and the ability to correlate immunocytochemical reactions with morphology.\r"

Using two human genomic DNA fragments cloned from the chromosome 18 band q21 as probes, we analyzed 65 uncultured human lymphoma samples by the Southern blot technique. The 18q21 gene was rearranged in 18 of 26 (69%) follicular lymphomas, 3 of 5 (60%) follicular lymphomas transformed to large cell lymphomas, 8 of 20 (40%) diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCLs), and 2 of 7 (29%) small noncleaved cell lymphomas (SNCs). Our analysis detected rearrangement of the 18q21 gene in 10 of 13 (77%) cases in which the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation was found by cytogenetic techniques. Our analysis also proved helpful in difficult karyotyping situations: (a) identifying the donor chromosome fragment as chromosome 18 band q21 in 4 of 9 (44%) cases that cytogenetically displayed a 14q+ chromosome of unknown origin, and (b) identifying a rearrangement of chromosome 18 band q21 in 12 of 18 (67%) cases that cytogenetically yielded no cells in metaphase. We also demonstrated three cases of submicroscopic rearrangement of the 18q21 gene. In our studies, patients with DLCLs and rearrangement of the 18q21 gene had a significantly higher incidence of extranodal involvement when compared with patients with DLCLs and no 18q21 gene rearrangement (P = 0.03).\r"

Survival analysis for the events 'death', 'local recurrence', and 'all recurrence' was undertaken using the Cox regression model. The best prognostic variables selected in a stepwise fashion for death and all recurrence were 'Dukes' classification', 'sialomucin present' and 'histological differentiation'.

The patients subsequently underwent enucleation, and the specimens were examined histopathologically. We reviewed the ultrasonograms for the presence of choroidal excavation, rupture through Bruch's membrane, retro-orbital fat shadowing, acoustic texture and retinal detachment. Comparison with the histopathological results showed that when conventional diagnostic criteria were used, most cases of rupture through Bruch's membrane were missed owing to the limits of resolution. No patients with homogeneous acoustic texture had pathological evidence of tumour necrosis or hemorrhage, while most of those with inhomogeneous texture did. The results suggest that high-resolution small-parts scanning may lead to reassessment of the conventional criteria for the diagnosis of intraocular melanomas.\r"

Overall toxicity was moderate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) on maintenance therapy was 3.2 years versus 2.0 years for those observed without treatment (P = 0.02). Progression-free survival was significantly shorter for patients with nodular and diffuse pattern (ND), histiocytic or mixed histology compared with pure nodular lymphocytic, or poorly differentiated counterpart (P = 0.0007), thus confirming the prognostic significance of histologic subtypes. However, the overall survival of patients was not improved by maintenance treatment, suggesting that therapy upon relapse was an equally effective alternative clinical strategy.\r"

  ".W": "A large panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera were used to ascertain the immunophenotypic characteristics of 36 lymphoblastic lymphomas (LBL). Results showed that this group of lymphomas have significant immunologic heterogeneity. Of the 36 cases, 33 were positive for T-cell antigens; among these, 22 cases were classified as T-cell LBL (TLBL, Group 1) based on their expression of T-cell-restricted and T-cell-associated antigens, and five expressed the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen in addition to T-cell-associated antigens (Group 2). Six cases showed strong reactivity with anti-Leu-11 antibody, which defines a specific subtype of lymphocytes considered to have a natural killer (NK) function (Group 3). Two additional cases had a \"pre-B\" cell phenotype (Group 4), as determined by reactivity with BA-1 and BA-2 monoclonal antibodies, which react with immature and pre-B-lymphocytes. The neoplastic cells in the remaining case showed monoclonal surface membrane immunoglobulin of the IgMD heavy chain and kappa light chain type (Group 5). Despite immunophenotypic heterogeneity, the morphologic features were essentially similar in all cases. When the clinical features for each immunologic group were compared, however, two statistically significant findings resulted: (1) the frequency of mediastinal masses was highest in TLBL (Group 1, P less than 0.01), and (2) the male-female ratio was significantly lower in patients with LBL expressing NK-associated antigens (Group 3) than in the other groups of patients (P less than 0.01). Our data indicate that LBL can be divided into several immunologic subtypes; larger, prospective clinicopathologic studies are required to determine the clinical significance of the immunophenotypic classifications of LBL.\r"

  ".W": "A specimen from the small intestine with multiple (three) classic carcinoid tumors and one appendiceal carcinoid tumor displaying argentaffinity, argyrophilia (Grimelius stain), and serotonin and neuron specific enolase immunoreactivity was examined by light microscopy with regard to the tumor cell histopathogenesis. The smallest tumor (diameter 0.5 cm) from the small intestine was cut into 512 and the appendiceal tumor into 511 serial sections, which were stained with the argyrophil technique. In the small intestine an increased number of endocrine cells and small proliferating aggregates of endocrine cells were observed among nonendocrine enterocytes in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. They seemed to grow initially inside the crypts and to later infiltrate through the basement membrane into the lamina propria of the mucosa. This finding suggests that classic carcinoid tumors of the small intestine develop from mucosal endocrine (enterochromaffin) cells. Since proliferating argentaffin cells were also seen in the mucosal crypts in one of the other two carcinoid tumors (2 cm in diameter) in the same intestine specimen, it is suggested that when multiple carcinoid tumors occur in the small intestine they arise from multiple sites. There was no apparent connection between the mucosal crypts and the carcinoid tumor of the appendix. Thus in this particular case, the appendiceal carcinoid tumor did not appear to derive from the mucosal endocrine cells but from the subepithelial endocrine cells that are present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the appendix wall. Supporting this view is the fact that S-100 protein immunoreactive cells are found both in close relation to subepithelial endocrine cells and as an integral component of appendiceal carcinoid tumors.\r"

In addition, he had elevated, nonsuppressible urinary 17-ketosteroids (17KS) and androsterone, but his urinary 17-hydroxycorticoids (17OHCS) and free cortisol were normal, as were his plasma cortisol and ACTH. After resection of the suprarenal mass, the patient's urinary hormone values reverted to normal. The mass contained a pheochromocytoma and an adrenocortical adenoma. The pheochromocytoma was unusual in that it contained very little norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) and an abundance of epinephrine (E) despite normal enzyme concentrations. Electron micrographs showed primarily E granules with few of the NE-type. The immunoperoxidase histochemical stains for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and serotonin (S) were strongly positive. The patient's blood pressure may have been normal because his pheochromocytoma secreted E, VIP, or S. The associated adrenocortical adenoma produced no symptoms and was probably coincidental.\r"

The overall response rates for septicemias and pneumonias were 75% and 58%. Among the 57 gram-negative infections 77% responded, but the response rate was substantially higher if imipenem was used as initial therapy (94% versus 69%). The poorest response rate was observed when imipenem was given as secondary therapy for Pseudomonas infections (50%), but most of these patients had failed to respond to other appropriate antibiotics. The only serious side effect was seizures which occurred in ten patients, although eight of them had other predisposing factors.

Those procedures were followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). All patients had received conventional chemo(radio)therapy before the ABMT procedure. Although remissions were obtained in patients with cytotoxic drug-resistant diseases (lymphomas and solid tumors), none has become a long-term survivor, as occurred also in patients with solid tumors in partial remission (PR). Two of five patients with NHL in PR at the time of ABMT have become long-term disease-free survivors (28+, 56+ months). Ten patients with NHL were treated in complete remission (CR) and seven are in unmaintained CR; four with long follow-up (14+ to 59+ months). All patients with AL were treated in CR; two patients received ABMT in second CR, and both relapsed. Ten of nineteen patients in first CR relapsed; eight are alive in CR, five with long follow-up. Four deaths were therapy-related, all were patients in poor clinical condition. Intensive cytoreductive therapy followed by ABMT can produce prolonged disease-free survival (and probably cure) in a fair number of patients with poor risk NHL in CR and PR and probably also in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia in first CR. This procedure was not successful in achieving long-term disease-free survival in patients with refractory lymphomas or solid tumors.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained in normal liver tissues and cholangiocarcinomas, and also with the previous observations of the authors on hepatocellular carcinomas. Although not detected in normal parenchymal liver cells, A, H, Lewis, and sialyl Lea antigens were found in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma cells. Incompatible A antigen also was detected in one blood type O patient. Distribution and intensity of the antigens were similar to those in hepatocellular carcinomas and different from those in cholangiocarcinomas. No preferential accumulation of blood-group antigens could be found in the area of cholangiocarcinoma-like differentiation of the combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. The observations suggested that Regional morphological differentiation of the hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma might not be always associated with the change in the expression of the blood group antigens. Moreover, the expression was essentially the same between the hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma and the typical hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, therefore could be a variant of the hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Computed tomography (CT) is currently the standard modality for staging of urologic cancer in most institutions. It is used for demonstrating nodal involvement, and for demonstrating invasion of the primary lesion into surrounding fat, muscle, or other tissues or organs. It is also useful for demonstrating hepatic metastases in renal and vesical carcinomas. The problem with computed tomography, however, is that it can only show whether the nodes are large or not; neither can it show the nodal architecture, nor can it detect metastases in normal-sized nodes. Intravesical sonography has been helpful for staging papillary bladder cancer. Transrectal sonography has been somewhat helpful for demonstrating seminal vesicle invasion in patients with prostatic carcinoma. Inferior vena cavography and renal venography can be helpful for demonstrating whether a renal, renal pelvic, or adrenal carcinoma has extended into either vein. Lymphography can show nodal architecture and metastases in normal-sized nodes, and can make possible needle biopsy of abnormal-appearing nodes even if they are normal sized. The examination cannot show very small or microscopic nodal metastases, and it can miss abnormal nodes totally if they have been completely replaced by metastases. It yields false positives when fatty or fibrous infiltration of the nodes has occurred. It is used primarily for staging patients with testis or prostatic carcinoma. Bone scans are essential for staging prostatic carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in some cases of renal cell carcinoma. Multiplanar imaging prevents overstaging. It is also accurate for showing whether the renal vein or inferior vena cava are involved. Enlarged lymph nodes are easily distinguished from vessels. For staging bladder carcinoma involving the fundus or base of the bladder, MRI is better than CT. Microscopic nodal metastases, such as are common in carcinoma of the prostate, currently are not detected by any imaging modality.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor markers (TMs) play an important part in the management of urologic cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and occasionally lactic dehydrogenase serological determinations have become indispensable in the management of nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumor patients, particularly after initial therapy, whereas human chorionic gonadotropin and probably placental alkaline phosphatase are important in seminoma. Prostatic acid phosphatase has long been important for the monitoring of patients with carcinoma of the prostate. The availability of the immunologic assays instead of the enzymatic assays has improved sensitivity somewhat but clinical interpretation has also become more complicated. Prostatic specific antigen is already an important tissue marker for carcinoma of the prostate and promises to be an important serological one, possibly surpassing prostatic acid phosphatase in importance. Analysis of DNA by automated flow cytometry is becoming important in the early detection and follow-up of bladder cancer patients. Studies concerning the tissue analysis of blood group antigens in bladder cancer continue to demonstrate that this approach can provide unique clinical information and interesting biological insights, but its role in routine clinical management remains to be determined. Currently, TMs have little clinical significance in renal cell carcinoma, but the availability of monoclonal antibodies to renal cell carcinoma preferential antigens may change this deficiency soon. In fact, in the near future, monoclonal antibodies will probably reveal many new substances for many urological cancers which can be used for markers serologically, histochemically, and, with their corresponding antibody, for radioimmune imaging and possibly immunotherapy. Now, as then, familiarity with the nuances of the marker and good clinical judgement will be essential.\r"

  ".W": "A few decades ago, there were few choices in the initial management of children with genitourinary tumors. Radical surgical removal was the only line of attack that promised any chance of survival. Improvement in the results of multimodal therapy in the last 15 years have radically altered the outlook for these children, hence the choice of therapy. As with other childhood cancers, the choice of therapy is based on risk-benefit evaluations of the roles of surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, since all three modalities have their associated morbidities. Current emphases are on preservation of function without compromising cure. The large cooperative clinical trials have emphasized this aspect of pediatric oncology. They have demonstrated, for example, that radiation therapy can be omitted from primary management of early stage Wilms' tumor patients who are given adequate adjuvant chemotherapy as can both radiation therapy and ablative surgery in certain cases of early stage rhabdomyosarcoma. Routine retroperitoneal node dissections have been shown to be of dubious diagnostic or therapeutic value in boys with testicular cancers. The need for bilateral oophorectomy in girls with dysgerminoma can similarly be questioned. Choices of initial therapy, therefore, are not static. They are becoming wider with each advance in multimodal therapy. Clinicians must keep abreast of the results of clinical trials so they can offer their patients the combination of treatments that will preserve function, and produce the smallest number of late complications without jeopardizing survival chances.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of patients with germ cell neoplasms has improved dramatically during the last 10 years. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin + vinblastine + bleomycin (PVB) was initiated at Indiana University in 1974. In this original study 28 of 47 patients (60%) with disseminated testicular tumors are currently alive, with a minimal follow-up of 10 years. Our next PVB study demonstrated that the vinblastine dosage could be reduced 25% (0.4 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg), thereby significantly reducing toxicity, without compromising the cure rate. Our third generation study confirmed the fact that maintenance therapy was not necessary, and that optimal cure rates could be achieved with merely 12 weeks of PVB induction. Overall, with follow-up of 5 to 10 years, 202 of 272 patients (74%) with disseminated testicular cancer currently are alive on these three PVB protocols. Because of the success of salvage chemotherapy, demonstrating that approximately 25% of patients not curable by PVB achieved durable complete remissions (CRs) with cisplatin + VP-16 combination chemotherapy, our next study compared PVB to cisplatin + VP-16 + bleomycin (PVP16B) as initial chemotherapy for disseminated testicular cancer. This study demonstrated that the two induction regimens produced equivalent CR rates, but that PVP16B was the preferable induction regimen because of a statistically significant reduction in neuromuscular toxicity. Our current studies will evaluate whether three courses (9 weeks) of PVP16B compared to the standard four courses of PVP16B (12 weeks) will achieve similar cure rates in minimal moderate disseminated disease. In advanced disease presentations, we are comparing standard PVP16B to double-dose cisplatin (40 mg/M2 X 5) + VP-16 + bleomycin.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data from Phase II trials in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract suggest combination chemotherapy regimens are inducing a higher number of complete remissions (CR), and an overall response rate between 50% and 70%. Most active combination regimens are cisplatin + methotrexate based or cisplatin + Adriamycin (doxorubicin) based. As single agents, cisplatin has a response rate of 30% in 320 patients, methotrexate, 29% in 236 cases, and Adriamycin, 17% in 248 cases. With each drug used singly, however, complete response is uncommon. Other active single agents include vinblastine (16% in 38 cases) and mitomycin C (13% in 42 cases). New agents being evaluated which show some promise include gallium nitrate, carboplatinum, and other antifols. In a trial by the Northern California Oncology Group which evaluated a combination of cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine (CMV), 28% of 50 cases achieved a CR lasting 44 weeks, and 28% a partial remission (PR) sustained for 29 weeks. A limited number of cases required surgical debulking for obtainment of CR status. At the University of Michigan, a trial of cisplatin and dichloromethotrexate induced responses in over 60% of cases. The regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) has been reported to induce CR in 37% of cases, and PR in an additional 31%. In the latter trial at Memorial Hospital in over 100 cases with bidimensionally measurable advanced disease, the median survival of CR has not yet been reached at 28 months, whereas those who achieve PR survive 12 months versus 6 months for nonresponders. Indirectly, the success of such combination regimens is apparent from the increasing number of central nervous system relapses, without systemic recurrence, in complete responders. Additional data indicate that cisplatin + methotrexate, without the addition of other drugs, is also an active regimen. The attainment of CR in 20% to 40% of cases given these multidrug regimens has led to adjuvant and neoadjuvant protocols. Although results of randomized prospective trials have not yet been reported, preliminary Phase II data are promising.\r"

Primary treatment of patients with tumors of the prostate, bladder neck, or trigone with chemotherapy has demonstrated the need to establish local tumor control using surgery or radiation soon after diagnosis. The IRS-III currently is evaluating new drug combinations in this group of patients with locally advanced tumors. Patients with advanced yolk sac tumor have been treated using platinum-containing combination chemotherapy regimens with very encouraging results. Future research will evaluate the timing of second-look surgical procedures and the efficacy of etoposide-containing combination chemotherapy regimens.\r"

Investigative therapy has the same intent but there is less assurance of success because therapy is untested or inconsistently effective; surgery for patients with metastatic disease and all protocols for chemohormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and biologic response modifiers are examples. Palliative therapy intends to relieve but not cure, a most worthwhile goal in patients whose comfort and sense of well-being are so often threatened. Strategies for palliation include surgery, irradiation, embolization/infarction, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and observation with only symptomatic relief. The last may be optimal for some patients since potential benefits must always outweigh the expected morbidity for therapy to be appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of any treatment strategy for cancer is to improve not only patient survival but also quality of that survival. Quality of life (QL) involves individual perceptions (physical, mental, social) which are particularly germane to management of recurrent and advanced urologic cancers. Cancer therapy ideally equally documents a patient's QL as well as tumor response and survival. The QL is best achieved by optimal therapy, defined as appropriate treatment of those patients who need it and avoiding unnecessary or overtreatment of those patients who are not expected to obtain significant benefit. Specific goals of management of urologic neoplasms should strive to eradicate all existing and/or palliate symptomatic disease with the least possible morbidity while attempting to preserve function. Some examples of positive advances in this regard include reduction of therapeutic burden in good-risk patients with germ cell neoplasms; preservation of bladder and sexual function in childhood, adolescent and adult pelvic sarcomas with initial chemoradiotherapy programs and conservative surgery; improved responses of metastatic bladder cancer with combination chemotherapy; pelvic nerve-sparing techniques to preserve sexual potency and continent external or internal urinary diversions should total cystectomy become necessary; prevent or delay cystectomy with intravesical therapy in high-risk patients with polychronotopic superficial bladder tumors and ureteropyeloscopic management (rather than nephroureterectomy) of selected upper tract urothelial tumors. On the negative side, no appreciable value can yet be ascribed to nephrectomy, adjunct radiation or chemotherapy, hormonal or immunotherapy for advanced locoregional or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, aggressive radiation or chemotherapy for nodal metastases from bladder or prostate cancer or hormonal and/or chemotherapy of the asymptomatic patient with metastatic prostatic cancer. Future treatment strategies will improve tumor responses that now prove refractory but they should not be applied at the expense of QL as assessed by the patient. Valid methods for objective measurements of QL need to be devised and incorporated into multimodality curative and palliative clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "With the exception of testis cancer, the variety of genitourinary cancers have not been found to be consistently responsive to chemotherapeutic agents or regimens for other than anecdotal short duration. This has generated keen interest in the possibility that biologic response modifiers might either directly or through manipulation of immune response mechanisms successfully prevent tumor progression in these systems. In recent years, those substances that have attracted the greatest attention have included interferon (and, more recently, recombinant gamma interferon), bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), tumor necrosis factor, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and interleukin-2. Results with each of these agents in the variety of genitourinary cancers have been both promising and disappointing. A number of mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the actions of each of these substances, and the successful or unsuccessful recruitment of these mechanisms, in the context of the particular intrinsic behavior of the cancers being treated, have been suggested as reasons for the treatment results that have been seen. Therapeutic efficacy has been described in the treatment of renal cell cancer by both systemic interferon and interleukin-2. Successful treatments have been reported in approximately 20% of patients treated with each substance, but generally, these results have been of short duration. Topical BCG has been used with great success to treat superficial transitional cell bladder cancer. In these instances, the generation of tumor necrosis factor has been suggested as possibly accounting for the 70% success rate both in therapy and prophylaxis that has been seen. Leukocyte-derived interferon and, more recently, recombinant gamma interferon, were found in initial trials to generate a 20% response rate in renal cell carcinoma patients. Enthusiasm for these agents, however, has been tempered more recently both by a failure to reproduce these results with any substantial duration as well as by the significant side effects that have been seen. Clearly, these agents continue to be intriguing both because of their intellectual appeal through the mechanisms by which they may be effective, as well as by the absence of any definitive therapy for the cancers they are being used to treat. An understanding of the complex host/tumor cell interaction that may ultimately determine therapeutic efficacy for each of these agents is undoubtedly critical if the role of these substances in the treatment of genitourinary cancer is to be successfully implemented, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.\r"

Candidate agents include analogs of vitamin A and the vitamin A precursor, beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and the trace metal selenium. Other agents now being studied in the laboratory include phenolic antioxidants, protease inhibitors, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, and indoles. Research in chemoprevention involves identifying and characterizing agents with reported activity, efficacy and toxicologic testing to select the most promising agents, and clinical trials to test those with the most potential in humans. Activities are underway in all the above areas, including 24 clinical trials, to evaluate selected compounds in preventing cancer at various cancer sites. Included are studies of individuals at high risk, individuals with precancerous lesions and individuals free of cancer but at risk to second cancers. A number of agents have shown activity in reducing bladder cancer incidence in animal models. The potential applicability of these agents for studies in human cancer risk reduction intervention studies is discussed. Cancer induction is postulated to be a multistage process involving initiation and promotion. Progress in cancer prevention may result from not only reducing exposures to initiators, but also suppressing promotional activity in initiated cells. Newly developed research technologies including cellular, animal, and epidemiologic procedures are being used for identifying, refining, and testing cancer prevention strategies.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity and specificity of immune reactions have long been recognized. However, since the description of the monoclonal antibody technique certain technical hurdles have been overcome. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology allows far more precise understanding of the humoral immune response by allowing dissection of this response into its individual B-lymphocyte populations. Furthermore, the ability to select and expand a particular B-cell clone allows for production of unlimited amounts of a pure antibody \"reagent.\" Each of these reagents may be readily used as a \"probe\" for its respective antigenic determinant. Panels of these reagents may be used to probe complex biologic structures (e.g., neoplastic cells) and thereby \"dissect\" them at a molecular level. Murine mAbs are produced by hyperimmunizing a mouse with the antigen of interest. The spleen provides a rich source of B-lymphocytes. These normal B-lymphocytes are incapable of surviving in culture. However, mouse B-lymphocyte tumor cell lines (myelomas) have been previously immortalized in tissue culture. A hybridoma is formed by fusing the normal immunized B-cells with myeloma cells. The hybridoma combines the best features of its parent cells. The immunoglobulin product of each resulting clone is screened against a panel of antigens. This allows selection of those clones producing antibody to the desired antigens. The mAb may be used to purify and/or characterize its respective antigen including definition of the chromosomal site of its gene and factors involved in the regulation of its expression. A large number of mAbs have been produced against renal, bladder, and prostate cancer antigens. These mAbs are allowing a more precise, molecular subclassification of these cancers and providing improved predictability of the natural history of each patient's cancer. Evidence in experimental animals demonstrates that mAbs accumulate at the site of tumor and can lead to the destruction of tumor cells. These encouraging results have prompted clinical trials in patients with metastatic cancer. Such a clinical trial in patients with metastatic renal cancer is currently underway at New York Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\r"

  ".W": "Technologic advances in diagnostic imaging have significantly improved the detection and staging accuracy of urologic cancer. Intravenous urography (IVU) is not sensitive for the detection of renal lesions, and a normal IVU does not exclude the presence of renal cancer. At this time, computed tomography (CT) is the method of choice for the detection of renal tumors. Ultrasound (US) can be used for the differentiation of cystic from solid lesions, but CT is more accurate. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging presently is inferior to CT for the detection of renal lesions. However, in the staging of known renal carcinoma, MR surpasses CT in the staging of large lesions or lesions of stage III and IV disease. In the detection of bladder tumors, cystoscopy and biopsy remain the most accurate diagnostic method. CT and MR imaging are indicated for the staging of bladder neoplasms. Transurethral US shows promise, but is still under investigation. At present, the combination of physical examination, transrectal US, and when needed, US-guided biopsy, are the optimal screening approaches for the detection of prostatic carcinoma. For the staging of diagnosed prostatic carcinoma, MR is superior to CT, but neither is accurate in assessing lymph node involvement. As compared with transrectal US, MRI is superior for the evaluation of extension to the bladder base and seminal vesicles. It is hoped that in the near future, localized tissue MR spectroscopy will be used clinically and will improve the specificity of diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma.\r"

However, there is a high recurrence rate because lymphangiomas tend to infiltrate the surrounding tissues. Bleomycin in a microsphere-in-oil (S/O) emulsion was used in this study as a sclerosing agent for lymphangiomas. Experimental studies using domestic rabbits showed that the bleomycin emulsion caused more marked fibrotic changes at the injection site than other formulations, such as a blank emulsion and bleomycin solution. In clinical trials, 27 of 33 patients received bleomycin S/O emulsion injected directly into the tumors with satisfactory results. Histologic pictures of the clinically resected specimens confirmed the findings of the experimental studies. Comparative studies of treatments between bleomycin S/O emulsion and surgery indicated that injection therapy of bleomycin S/O emulsion would be more beneficial than surgical excisions.\r"

As a result, real-time sonography yielded the most accurate determination of breast cancer size in this series. Sonographic tumor size determination has proved valuable when mammography failed to delineate the tumor, particularly in patients with dense breasts.

The patients have serum antibodies against a small number of discrete antigens which are shared by the retina and small cell carcinoma cells, and which are associated with cells and processes of the ganglion cell layer of the retina. Pathologic findings are presented with regard to the presence of immunoglobulins in, and the nature of the lesions in, the central nervous system of a VPS patient. The patient's blood-brain barrier was shown to be compromised, as demonstrated by the finding of high immunoglobulin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and immune deposits in the retina. It is further shown that within the central nervous system only the retina and optic nerve show any tissue damage with the specific loss of retinal ganglion cells and their processes. The findings support the hypothesis of an autoimmune cause for this remote effect of cancer.\r"

Marked variation of tumor grade and antigen expression was demonstrated in individual tumors and this may be a limiting factor in the use of radioisotope linked HMFG2 for tumor therapy. A similar prevalence was found in the expression of the antigens defined by the monoclonal antibodies HMFG1 and F36/22; whereas the AUA1 antigen was demonstrated in 68% of cases.

Normal brain displayed a finely granular intracytoplasmic staining confined to neuronal cells. Glial cells were negative for API. Fifteen of the 17 brain tumors were positive for API. Only two of five low-grade gliomas were negative for API. Glioblastoma and metastatic tumors exhibited the strongest positivity followed by acoustic neuroma, meningioma, and low-grade glioma. All positive samples exhibited finely granular intracytoplasmic API, and 50% exhibited extracellular API positivity.

  ".W": "Review of 61 surgically resected small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter yielded a simple gross classification system of five types based on tumor shape, which is highly correlated with microscopic and clinical features, including prognosis. Type 1 (single nodular type) tumors (n = 13) are expansile, roughly spheric, and often encapsulated. In Type 2 tumors (single nodular type with extranodular growth) (n = 21), replacing growth is often seen in the area of extranodular growth. Type 3 tumors (contiguous multinodular type) (n = 19) consist of small nodules growing in contiguity, often with replacing growth at the periphery. Type 4 (poorly demarcated nodular type) is a rare tumor showing infiltrating growth at its border. The authors define early HCC (n = 5) as the presence of tumor without destruction of the underlying liver structure. The lesions experienced are tiny (less than or equal to 1.2 cm) and well differentiated. Poorly differentiated histologic characteristics and elevated alpha fetoprotein are more common in Types 2 and 3 than in Type 1. Type 1 has the highest rates of positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen and liver cirrhosis; portal vein tumor thrombus (PT) and/or intrahepatic metastasis (IM) is rare (7.7%), and the effect of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is remarkable. This contrasts with Type 2, which has a high rate of PT and/or IM (71.4%) and multiple local recurrences (40%), and with Type 3, which shows a poor response to TAE.\r"

Perfusate recirculated except during L-platelet activating factor (L-PAF), angiotensin II (ang II), and norepinephrine (NE) infusions. L-PAF caused a dose-dependent decrease in renovascular resistance (RVR): -6 +/- 3% at 10(-9)M, -12 +/- 6% at 10(-8)M, -18 +/- 3% at 10(-7) and -20 +/- 7% at 10(-6)M. L-PAF increased immunoreactive PGE (iPGE) and thromboxane (iTXB) release into the venous effluent from 2.4 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.4 ng/min (p less than 0.05) and from 2.1 +/- 0.4 to 3.5 +/- 0.5 ng/min (p less than 0.05), respectively. Vasodilation by L-PAF (10(-7) M) in the presence of indomethacin (INDO) (5 microM) was enhanced compared to the non-INDO response (RVR change: L-PAF = -18 +/- 3% vs. L-PAF = -26 +/- 3%; p less than 0.05). As a control for specificity, the was infused at 10(-9) M, 10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M. None of these concentrations changed renal vascular resistance. To study the vascular receptor responsible for L-PAF-induced vasodilation, dose-response curves to NE and ang II were established with and without L-PAF (10(-7) M). The NE dose-response curve was unchanged by L-PAF, whereas the ang II dose-response curve was shifted to the right by one order of magnitude. In kidneys pretreated with INDO (5 microM), the L-PAF-induced shift of the ang II dose-response relation was increased to 2-3 orders of magnitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Proteases from human neutrophils can generate angiotensin II directly from angiotensin I or angiotensinogen. We examined whether neutrophil protease also influences angiotensin formation by activating human prorenin (also called inactive renin). When incubated with partially purified plasma and amniotic prorenin, sonicates from 10(6) neutrophils resulted in 120 +/- 30% and 1,240 +/- 290% increase in renin activity, respectively. The pH optimum of neutrophil prorenin-activating enzyme(s) is 6.5-7.0, and the activity of the enzyme(s) is inhibited by a mixture of serine protease inhibitors but not by inhibitors of other proteases, suggesting that prorenin-activating enzyme(s) is a neutral serine protease(s). Stimulation of neutrophils by f-met-leu-phe in the presence of cytochalasin B resulted in release of prorenin-activating enzyme(s) in a dose-dependent fashion. We attempted to isolate prorenin-activating enzyme(s) from neutrophil granules using aprotinin-affinity and carboxymethyl cellulose chromatographies. Prorenin-activating enzyme(s) coeluted with cathepsin G and elastase activities. Prorenin activation was greatly inhibited by anticathepsin G antiserum. Purified cathepsin G activated prorenin in a dose-dependent fashion. Elastase probably also contributes to prorenin activation since purified elastase also activated human prorenin. We speculate that this neutrophilic angiotensin-generating system may play a role in the local generation and concentration of angiotensins by influencing multiple steps of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of angiotensin II immunoreactivity in the rat adrenal gland are over one hundredfold higher than those in plasma. It is unclear, however, whether the major source of adrenal angiotensin II immunoreactivity is intracellular synthesis by a local renin-angiotensin system, uptake by angiotensin II receptors, or both. Our studies show that angiotensin II immunoreactivity in the adrenal gland is predominantly attributable to angiotensin II (greater than 75%). Angiotensin III (16%) and other angiotensin II fragments are also present. The majority of angiotensin II immunoreactivity (73%), renin activity (73%), and angiotensin II receptor binding activity (66%) in the adrenal gland is located in the capsular glomerulosa cell layers. Dehydration produced by 2% NaCl imbibition decreased these activities in the capsular-glomerulosa. In the fasciculata-medullary regions of the adrenal gland, dehydration decreased renin activity but not angiotensin II immunoreactivity or angiotensin II receptor binding activity. Combined data from control and dehydrated rats showed a close correlation of the capsular-glomerulosa angiotensin II immunoreactivity with angiotensin II receptor binding activity (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001) and a weaker, nonsignificant correlation with renin activity (r = 0.66, p less than 0.1). In the fasciculata-medullary cell layers, no significant correlations were found between angiotensin II immunoreactivity and either renin or angiotensin II receptor binding activity. These data demonstrate that functionally distinct layers of the rat adrenal gland differentially regulate angiotensin II receptors and the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The prostacyclin analogue iloprost (ZK 36374) inhibits neutrophil activation in vitro, reduces neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory skin lesions, and reduces ultimate infarct size in an anesthetized open-chest canine model of regional ischemia and reperfusion. Iloprost (0.1-100 microM) inhibited the in vitro production of superoxide anion by canine neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner. Iloprost (100 ng/kg/min i.v.) inhibited C5a-induced neutrophil migration into inflammatory skin lesions as assessed by the neutrophil-specific enzyme marker, myeloperoxidase. The myeloperoxidase activity determined 2 hours after the intradermal administration of C5a in each of the groups was control 13.3 +/- 1.8 units/g tissue (n = 12) and iloprost 6.5 +/- 0.9 units/g (n = 12), p less than 0.01. Iloprost was administered to anesthetized open-chest dogs (100 ng/kg/min) 10 minutes after left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) occlusion and continued during the 90-minute occlusion period and the first 2 hours of reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was similar between treatment groups at baseline, 5 minutes and 80 minutes after LCCA occlusion, and after 1 hour of reperfusion. Infarct size, assessed 6 hours after reperfusion, was reduced by iloprost treatment: 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the area at risk (n = 15) compared with 42.4 +/- 3.3% of control (n = 13), p less than 0.01. Iloprost treatment reduced the accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) in the ischemic myocardium at the interface between infarcted and noninfarcted tissue: control (n = 9) 9.0 +/- 1.8 units/g tissue, iloprost (n = 6) 2.0 +/- 0.4 units/g, p less than 0.01.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right atrial and left ventricular biopsies, heart rate responses to isoproterenol, and maximal exercise treadmill testing were obtained before and after 10-19 weeks of treadmill running. Radioligand studies using 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to determine the number of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Maximal oxygen consumption increased from 52 +/- 5 to 65 +/- 7 ml/kg/min (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.02), maximal workload from 530 +/- 111 to 1,074 +/- 179 KPM/min (p less than 0.01), resting heart rate decreased from 91 +/- 13 to 62 +/- 4 beats/min (p less than 0.01), heart rate at 75% of pretraining maximal workload decreased from 253 +/- 15 to 196 +/- 12 beats/min (p less than 0.01), and maximal exercise heart rate decreased from 273 +/- 6 to 254 +/- 9 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Decreased heart rate responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation was observed following chronic exercise. Maximal isoproterenol-stimulated heart rate decreased from 225 +/- 13 to 185 +/- 28 beats/min (p less than 0.05) and the slope of the isoproterenol dose-response relation decreased from 63 +/- 16 to 40 +/- 16 (p less than 0.05). Radioligand studies revealed a decrease in beta-receptor number in the right atrium following chronic exercise (61 +/- 9 vs. 34 +/- 8 fmol/mg; p less than 0.02), but receptor number in membranes from the left ventricle did not change (60 +/- 9 vs. 62 +/- 4 fmol/mg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The RNA from rat liver, brain, and heart was analyzed by the Northern hybridization procedure using nick translated angiotensinogen cDNA as a probe. In addition to liver, the angiotensinogen mRNA is present in the brain and the heart. The angiotensinogen mRNA in the heart is at least fourfold to fivefold more abundant as compared with the liver. We also provide evidence that angiotensinogen mRNA is present in the rat atria and right ventricle but not detectable in the left ventricle.

  ".W": "The role of thyroid hormone on the heart in terms of contractility, induction of growth, and selective synthesis of cardiac isomyosins was studied. After transplanting rat hearts from inbred hypothyroid donors into the abdomen of hypothyroid recipients of the same strain, two hearts were obtained in the same animal, both having reduced heart rate (200-250 bpm), decreased maximum rate of force, and high predominance of V3 isomyosin. The heart in situ carried a full load, while the transplant was denervated, beat isovolumically with minimum external work. After surgery, the recipient rats were put either on normal diet only (controls) or injected with a daily dose of T3 (average 200 micrograms/kg), which increased the heart rate to 340 bpm in 3 days (euthyroid level) and to 450 bpm in 7 days (hyperthyroid level). In T3-treated rats, the contractility of both hearts normalized in 7 days and showed hyperthyroid pattern in 14 days, while the mass of the in situ hearts increased to normal values in 7 days (+130 mg) and hypertrophied in 14 days (+340 mg), in contrast to the transplanted heart, which underwent atrophy (-90 mg and -210 mg) similar to that of control group (-225 mg). The predominant V3 isomyosin was completely reversed to V1 in two weeks in both hearts. Thus, T3 can neither stimulate cardiac growth nor can it attenuate the rate of atrophy in the denervated \"nonworking\" heart in spite of its direct effect on contractility and synthesis of isomyosins, which was similar to that observed in the in situ heart.\r"

In this study we analyzed two well-defined surface electrocardiographic recordings by fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Blackman Harris window, 512 points) after low-noise, high-gain amplification (filter setting 0.5 to 300 Hz) each day for 4 weeks after cardiac transplantation in 27 patients. Twenty acute rejection crises requiring treatment were diagnosed by cytoimmunologic monitoring and endomyocardial biopsy. Single-beat analysis of the QRS complex by FFT revealed a progressive change of the spectral morphology (increase of the frequency content between 70 and 110 Hz) on the days of rejection in 19 of 20 patients. At that time there were no visible changes on the electrocardiogram in the time domain in most patients. At the same time, the frequency content of the ST segment decreased between 10 and 30 Hz in 16 of 20 patients. After successful treatment, the frequency spectra of the QRS complex and ST segment returned to control within 1 to 2 weeks in most patients. One false-positive result was seen in a patient with mediastinitis and large pericardial effusion. A drop in QRS amplitude (greater than 20%) occurred in 10 of 20 rejection crises and in 10 patients without rejection. Nine patients after cardiac transplantation without rejection and seven control patients after cardiac surgery (not transplantation) showed stable frequency plots from one day to the other after the first postoperative day, but with considerable changes in QRS amplitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cigarette smoking is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease that declines after cessation. This study extends the evidence regarding the effects of chronic smoking on platelets and the vessel wall in vivo. Excretion of a major urinary thromboxane metabolite, 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, is significantly (p less than .01) elevated in apparently healthy chronic smokers (20 cigarettes daily) compared with that in nonsmoking control subjects. This difference in excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 was abolished by the administration of 20 mg aspirin twice daily, a dose shown to selectively inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase. After aspirin, the return of the excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 to pretreatment levels paralleled the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase. These findings indicate that excessive thromboxane A2 generation in chronic smokers predominantly derives from platelets. The urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha also is increased during chronic cigarette smoking, as is the case with other diseases associated with accelerated interaction of platelets with the vessel wall. We have found evidence of platelet and vascular dysfunction in vivo in chronic cigarette smokers before the manifestation of overt cardiovascular disease. The results would also be consistent with the hypothesis that in chronic smokers, the platelet defect is largely reflective of smoking-induced vascular injury.\r"

  ".W": "Mapping of blood velocities across the lumen of the ascending aorta was performed in eight patients during open-heart surgery. A Doppler ultrasound probe was constructed to measure velocities in 2 mm steps from the maximum convexity to the maximum concavity of aorta, 6 to 7 cm above the aortic valve. In five patients with angina and normal aortic valves, velocity profiles were very similar and showed the following main features: a skewed peak systolic velocity profile with the highest velocity along the left posterior wall, a bidirectional velocity profile in late systole and early diastole with retrograde velocities along the left posterior wall, and a sustained antegrade flow along the convexity well into diastole. The resultant mean velocity profile had the highest velocity at the convex side and a central minimum velocity. In patients with Medtronic-Hall tilting disc prostheses, where the larger opening was oriented backwards and to the right, mean flow velocity profile was skewed in the opposite direction of normal. Moreover, instant systolic velocity profiles were much more irregular and dependent on the exact orientation of the prosthesis. In one patient with aortic valvular disease, very irregular and different velocity profiles were found. Based on a symmetry assumption, overall mean velocity for the total cross section was computed, and the magnitude of error in estimation of total flow from measurement of velocities at different depths was calculated. To measure total flow in the aorta, i.e., cardiac output, by single-gated Doppler technique, the most representative sampling site was about one-third of the diameter from the convex wall.\r"

The \"defense reaction\" is of particular interest because of its widespread neurohormonal excitatory influences and frequent, although mild, engagement in daily life events. Evidence is presented showing how common genetic variants of primary hypertension, both in man and spontaneously hypertensive rats, are characterized by a genetically linked central hyperreactivity to psychosocial stimuli. As a result, the previously mentioned central response pattern--with its differentiated excitatory and tropic effects that also involve salt-volume regulation--is more commonly elicited by even trivial environmental stimuli, therefore constituting an important triggering influence in these variants of primary hypertension. Also discussed is the potential genetic nature of this central hyperreactivity and, further, how it interacts with other genetic-environmental influences and with the early induction of structural cardiovascular adaptation, by which the entire system is gradually reset to operate at a raised pressure equilibrium.\r"

Data are now available regarding several psychosocial risk factors that shed light on possible environmental influences. These factors include social mobility, stressful life events, type A behavior, and social support.

In general, studies of populations not selected according to CHD risk support the conclusion that the global type A construct is predictive of increased risk of coronary events. In high-risk groups, including patients undergoing coronary angiography, the evidence with respect to global type A is much less clear. This stems from the fact that most of these studies, although generally failing to find statistically significant relationships between coronary events and type A behavior, are flawed in a number of ways, including inadequate statistical power of results, use of less than adequate instruments, and failure to take an apparent interaction between type A behavior and age into account. Nevertheless, taken together, these findings suggest that it may be possible to identify measures of coronary-prone behavior that are more powerful than the global type A measure. Extensive evidence suggests that such measures may be found in the domain of hostility and anger. Measures of hostility and anger coping styles have been found to be associated with coronary atherosclerosis in populations in which global type A was not related to disease, and measures of hostility have predicted increased coronary events and total mortality in prospective population samples followed for from 20 to 25 years. Preliminary evidence suggests that hostility/anger characteristics may account for the increased coronary risk associated with global type A behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each of these major risk factors is influenced by behavioral choices made by individuals and supported by societies. Behavioral medicine has a rich tradition of dealing with individuals and small groups. The public health perspective of disease challenges behavioral medicine to develop new strategies and tactics for behavioral modification for health promotion on a population-wide basis. Additional research is needed to test effective methods for influencing population behavior, population risk factors, and ultimately population morbid and mortal event rates. Several major community projects are now investigating the health promotion process targeting individuals, small groups, organizations, and the entire community. School, worksites, and churches are particularly conducive to health promotion programming. Each has unique advantages and disadvantages; each deserves careful experimentation to determine its efficacy for population-wide health promotion efforts. A public health dimension to behavioral change promises widespread impact, generalization to other health promotive behaviors, maintenance of new cultural behavioral norms, and significant reductions in the incidence of many chronic diseases.\r"

The success of approaches to secondary prevention now relate to quality, as well as quantity, of life. A multifaceted program, including dietary management, smoking cessation, physical exercise, modification of type A behavior, and psychological counseling are components of many cardiac rehabilitation programs. Behavioral interventions are effective in reducing traditional risk factors for CHD events, and for improving the quality of life among victims of a disease with significant psychological, as well as physical, consequences. However, the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for prolonging life is less certain and requires more careful evaluation. The mechanisms by which behavioral treatments may influence clinical CHD end points is also in need of further investigation.\r"

Sudden CHD deaths should be classified as those occurring in individuals with and those in individuals without a prior history of clinical heart disease. The extent of coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias are the primary pathophysiologic determinants of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Psychosocial factors influence the threshold of response to the numerous physical and social environmental stimuli that can precipitate sudden death. The degree of pathology is probably inversely related to the intensity of the stimuli necessary to precipitate sudden CHD death. In the presence of extensive disease the precipitants of sudden deaths are probably ubiquitous in the environment and unlikely to be prevented. Thus, prevention of the basic cardiac disease is of higher priority.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing evidence indicates that sudden death resulting from ventricular fibrillation may be triggered in some patients by behavioral and neural factors. In animal preparations, diverse psychologic stressors and augmented sympathetic neural traffic to the heart lower the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated increased cardiac fatality after bereavement and unemployment, as it relates to social class and cultural dislocation, and as a function of level of education, psychologic stress, and social isolation. Ventricular premature beats (VPBs), which may be risk indicators of susceptibility to sudden death, are not affected by perturbations of the peripheral autonomic nervous system. However, differing psychologic stressors increase, whereas their abatement diminishes, VPB frequency and grade. The most potent stressors relate to the recall of emotionally charged experiences. Such stressors are uniquely individual and cannot be readily replicated. Among the most significant factors to reduce VPBs are non-rapid eye movement sleep and increases in vagal neural activity. Psychological precipitants are demonstrable in about 20% of patients experiencing malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A promising new avenue for investigation relates to the role of various central neurotransmitters and their dietary precursors in cardiac neural traffic. Augmenting central serotonin by administering its tryptophan precursor reduces sympathetic neural activity and protects the heart against ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".U": "87244812\r", 
  ".W": "Systems in the brain control blood pressure by maintaining life-sustaining, resting (tonic) levels and adjusting blood pressure in association with changes in regional blood flow appropriately coupled to behavior or environmental stimulation. Tonic levels of blood pressure are mediated by neurons in the medulla oblongata. The critical neurons appear to correspond to the epinephrine-containing cells of the so-called C1 group located in the rostral ventral lateral medulla. These also mediate baroreceptor reflex responses. Behaviorally coupled changes in blood pressure are often highly stereotyped and vary depending on the behavior being performed in both animals and humans. These reactive circulatory adjustments are largely mediated by forebrain regions working in concert with the medullary centers. Some of the largest increases in blood pressure occur in response to aversive emotional arousal. In hypertensive animals and humans, such changes, which are normally buffered by reflex mechanisms in the brainstem, are exaggerated. In the rat, the neural pathway mediating the coupling, through aversive emotional conditioning, of blood pressure responses to acoustic stimuli involves the transmission of sensory signals through the primary auditory projection system to the medial geniculate body, where the input is then relayed subcortically to the amygdala. The amygdala, presumably by way of connections with the hypothalamus, and from there to the brainstem or spinal cord, controls the learned emotional response. These findings, which implicate a largely unrecognized sensory relay to the amygdala in emotional learning, represent the first demonstration of a direct link between primary sensory system and autonomic control regions in the mammalian brain.\r"

Some of these findings may be important in explaining individual differences in susceptibility to atherosclerosis that are independent of known risk factors. Nonhuman primates are valuable models for the study of mechanisms of diet-induced atherosclerosis. Cynomolgus macaques are useful for studies of male-female differences in atherosclerosis, since they share with premenopausal white women a relative protection against coronary atherosclerosis compared with males. These animals are also useful for psychosocial atherosclerosis research since social status affects the extent of atherosclerosis, and experimentally induced social stress increases extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Nonhuman primates have also been useful for studies of individual differences in susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis and its risk factors. These studies have indicated that about 75% of the variability in the plasma cholesterol response to dietary cholesterol is attributable to genetically determined differences in cholesterol absorption and lipoprotein catabolism. There is preliminary evidence suggesting the existence of \"mesenchymal susceptibility\" in nonhuman primates; i.e., differences in risk of atherosclerosis that are independent of exposure to known risk factors. Efforts are being made to establish colonies of rhesus monkeys that possess contrasting degrees of mesenchymal susceptibility.\r"

Animal preparations provide an opportunity to test hypotheses concerning the role of psychosocial phenomena in atherogenesis and to explore the mechanisms by which the effects of such phenomena are mediated. Here we review a relatively large series of studies of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), a 5 kg animal having a complex social organization. The data indicate that, among male animals, individual behavior characteristics (social status and aggressiveness), physiologic responsiveness to psychological challenge, and stability of the social environment all interact to affect atherogenesis. Among female animals, individual patterns of aggressiveness appear to influence ovarian function, which in turn affects atherosclerosis. Future advances in the behavioral medicine aspects of atherogenesis are likely to arise through elucidation of the pathophysiologic pathways by which these behavioral responses and characteristics contribute to the events (endothelial injury, smooth muscle cell proliferation, lipid accumulation, calcification, and necrosis) associated with plaque pathogenesis. Such research can be pursued in studies utilizing nonhuman primates as well as in complementary studies involving human subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Significant progress has been made in the past few years in defining the role of behavioral stress in the precipitation of cardiac arrhythmias. This is largely attributable to the development of relevant biobehavioral models and the advent of quantitative methods for assessing myocardial electrical stability in conscious animals. Classic and instrumental aversive conditioning has been shown to decrease electrical stability even in the normal heart. During evolving myocardial ischemia or infarction, the stress states can precipitate major arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation. Natural emotions have also been shown to be capable of altering the propensity to fibrillation. Notably, provocation of an angerlike state has been shown to decrease the vulnerable period threshold by 40% to 50%. The poststress phase can be particularly hazardous, as suggested by the profound myocardial perfusion abnormalities that have been observed within 1 to 3 min after cessation of anger. Cryogenic blockade of the thalamic gating system or its output from the frontal cortex to the brainstem blunts significantly the profibrillatory influence of stress. This indicates that discrete pathways within the central nervous system mediate the deleterious influence of aversive states on heart rhythm. Adrenergic factors appear to constitute the major effector component. This is supported by the observation that pharmacologic or surgical sympathectomy is capable of annulling the arrhythmogenic influence of diverse types of stress. The generally deleterious influence of the adrenergic system appears to be counteracted by vagal activity. The underlying mechanism is a muscarinically mediated inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings and a blunting of the actions of the adrenergic transmitters at the receptor level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The review focuses on English-language reports published since 1975 and emphasizes two broad areas of research: changes in mean blood pressures of third world populations undergoing modernization, and psychosocial correlates of elevated blood pressure in low socioeconomic status (SES) and black populations within the continental United States. The recent modernization studies provide additional evidence that rapid sociocultural change is associated with increased prevalence of hypertension. To account for these effects, several studies have advanced the general thesis that modernization impacts traditional value systems of third world populations in ways that frequently engender discrepancies between their newly acquired aspirations for a Western lifestyle and their socioeconomic resources to successfully pursue that lifestyle. There is overlap between this formulation and recent investigations of hypertension in low SES and black populations in the United States. The report concludes with a discussion of epidemiologic studies of anger and hypertension, emphasizing some of the complexities that characterize this area of research.\r"

In animal preparations, chronic exposure to stressors in conjunction with predisposing genetic factors of high sodium/low potassium intake can lead to hypertension and cardiac pathology. Studies with human subjects are less definitive, but several lines of evidence suggest that high heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to behavioral stressors may indicate an increased susceptibility to hypertension, including an association between high reactivity and both borderline hypertension and a positive family history of hypertension, observations that stressors involving active coping evoke enhanced beta-adrenergic myocardial activity, resulting in cardiac output that is excessive relative to overall tissue oxygen consumption, and observations of decreased short-term sodium and fluid excretion during stressors in some individuals and an association between high salt intake and increased peak blood pressure levels evoked by exposure to stress. Indicated directions for future animal research include studies of the interactive effects of chronic stress with other environmental factors, such as high and low calcium intake, while in humans, future studies should incorporate monitoring of cardiovascular responses to real-life events, and should also include long-term follow-up investigations to evaluate more directly the predictive significance of high cardiovascular reactivity to stress.\r"

The situation is further clouded by the fact that blood pressure varies greatly from moment to moment in any one individual, as shown by ambulatory recordings. The fundamental pattern of diurnal blood pressure variations is governed by the sleep-wakefulness cycle, on which the effects of different activities are superimposed. Although hyperreactivity of blood pressure to behavioral stimuli could in theory contribute to the elevation of blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, this would not by itself explain the sustained elevation of blood pressure that is usually seen throughout the day and night in such patients. It is not known how blood pressure variability contributes to the vascular changes associated with hypertension; three possibly relevant factors are the average level of pressure over time, the peaks of pressure, and the shape of the pressure waveform (dP/dt). Hyperreactivity of blood pressure occurring in the doctor's office may be of considerable practical importance in the evaluation of patients with mild hypertension and may confound the relationship between clinical and overall blood pressure and also the evaluation of the response to antihypertensive treatment. Recordings of blood pressure made outside the clinic may help to overcome these problems.\r"

In 52 patients on maintenance hemodialysis, serum beta 2-m concentration was elevated to 37.9 +/- 1.4 (normal 1.2 +/- 0.6) mg/l. It was correlated with the time on hemodialysis (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01) and was inversely correlated with residual renal function (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). In 20 patients on CAPD, beta 2-m likewise was increased to 31.6 +/- 2.3 mg/l; daily elimination by dialysate was only 34 mg (normal 150 mg). Hemodialysis with a cuprophane membrane caused a rise in serum beta 2-m, whereas hemodiafiltration with a polysulfone membrane performed in 5 patients over 2 1/2 months was accompanied by a decrease in serum beta 2-m from 39.5 +/- 0.7 to 29.7 +/- 1.0 mg/l predialysis (19.1 +/- 1.1 postdialysis). On the other hand, beta 2-m elimination reached only approximately 100 mg per day in spite of markedly elevated serum levels. It is concluded that serum beta 2-m is massively elevated in long-term hemodialysis and CAPD patients; contrary to routine hemodialysis with cuprophane membranes, newer more permeable membranes will permit some elimination of beta 2-m. However, based on quantitative considerations it seems difficult to obtain beta 2-m concentrations in the high normal or moderately elevated range with present day techniques.\r"

Acute administration of enalapril produced a significant decrement in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure but had no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was enhanced by gradually increasing the dose of the drug or by addition of a diuretic during six to eight weeks of chronic therapy. During chronic enalapril therapy, four patients developed renal insufficiency that reversed after discontinuation of the drug. In three of these four cases, overt renal insufficiency was associated temporally with the addition of a diuretic. Digital angiography revealed unequivocal transplant renal-artery stenosis in three of the four patients with renal insufficiency; the fourth patient had diffuse narrowing of the transplant renal artery without a discrete stenosis. It is concluded that enalapril alone or in combination with a diuretic is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with post-transplant hypertension. The development of renal insufficiency during enalapril therapy may be exacerbated by concomitant diuretic therapy and should raise the suspicion of underlying transplant renal-artery stenosis. The acute blood pressure or renal response to a small dose of enalapril does not reliably predict the development of renal insufficiency during treatment with larger doses of the drug.\r"

Grid patterns based on patellar anatomy enabled topographic compression on a material test system (MTS) Model 835 Bionix Universal Testing Machine (MTS Corporation, Minneapolis, MN) using a 4-mm diameter indentor. It was demonstrated that sacrifice of the patellar subchondral bone removes with it the strong cancellous bone support and topographic strength patterns of the cancellous bone on the surface of a patellar osteotomy does not have a consistent pattern in relation to the intracondylar eminence. Consequently, placement of fixation pegs is not critical with respect to strength of bony support.\r"

  ".W": "The trapeziometacarpal joint is often affected by arthritis and treated by surgical methods. The significant forces to which this joint is subjected challenge even the most sturdy prosthetic materials. Short-term complications of arthroplasty are caused by inadequate bony resection and instability. Serious long-term problems results from implant wear and the host tissues' response to the implant. Although silicone elastomer prostheses are generally well tolerated, wear-induced microparticles (15 micron or less) incite an intense inflammatory and destructive synovial response. This \"silicone synovitis\" typically presents more than two years after arthroplasty and is characterized by pain, swelling, and lytic lesions visible on roentgenogram. The silicone microparticles are generated by cyclic physiologic bearing, shear, and compression forces for which these implants have not been tested. The destructive synovitis is arrested by synovectomy, implant removal, and curettage of the lytic defects. Functional salvage requires conversion to resection arthroplasty or arthrodesis. Patients with silicone implant arthroplasty must be followed indefinitely, at frequent intervals, by clinical examination and roentgenograms. Overall, however, experience indicates that resection arthroplasty is the most predictable and functional procedure for the nonrheumatoid basal thumb joint.\r"

Ethical problems in selective termination in high-risk twin and multiple pregnancies need more study. A preliminary evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing standards in prenatal diagnosis was also made. Three weaknesses were noted: neglect of the demands for fairness in access to and distribution of prenatal diagnosis in the United States, unpreparedness for society's growing concerns about developing trends in human genetics, and need for changes in non-directive counseling in order to appreciate the complexities that will accompany the introduction of proven new treatments for genetic disorders.\r"

Nicardipine was given intravenously as a 2 mg bolus, followed by an infusion at a rate designed to lower the supine diastolic blood pressure at least 10 mm Hg; then oral captopril, 50 mg, or placebo was given. The next week, nicardipine was again infused, but the alternate oral treatment was given. Intravenous nicardipine reduced blood pressure from 156 +/- 15/101 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean arterial blood pressure 120 +/- 6 mm Hg) to 140 +/- 11/88 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean arterial blood pressure 105 +/- 5 mm Hg). When captopril was added to nicardipine, the mean arterial blood pressure fell an additional 8 mm Hg but the heart rate did not increase. The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockage produces additive antihypertensive effects without additional reflex tachycardia.\r"

A double-blind, randomized trial comparing pinacidil with hydralazine when combined with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol to control side effects or the diastolic blood pressure was performed. Pinacidil decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 156/100 mm Hg to 132/81 mm Hg. The increase in heart rate and weight with both drugs was controlled with the additional drugs. There was 1/17 successes on monotherapy with both drugs. When combined with other drugs there were 15/18 successes with hydralazine and 16/20 successes with pinacidil. Side effects were typical of vasodilators. Both drugs acutely increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine during chronic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The time course (12, 24 and 48 h) of changes in blood metabolites, and in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, in isolated hepatocytes from rats made septic by caecal ligation and puncture was measured. Blood glucose was not significantly different in septic rats, but lactate was increased at 12, 24 and 48 h; pyruvate and alanine were increased at 48 h. The blood ketone body concentrations were decreased at all times studied after induction of sepsis. These changes were accompanied by increased plasma insulin in the septic rats. The rate of hepatic lipogenesis in vivo was increased at 24 and 48 h. There were appreciable increases in the hepatic concentrations of alanine (200%), lactate (200%) and pyruvate (100%) as well as other intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway. The hepatic concentrations of acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies were decreased. The rate of gluconeogenesis from added lactate, pyruvate, alanine and glutamine was depressed in isolated hepatocytes from septic rats at 24 and 48 h. The basal rate of ketogenesis or the rate from butyrate in isolated hepatocytes was not significantly altered by sepsis, whereas the rate from oleate was decreased at all time points. It is concluded that there is an impairment of the capacity for gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in livers of septic rats. The latter may be due to decreased entry of long-chain acyl-CoA into the mitochondria for oxidation. The possibility that these changes are in part brought about by the hyperinsulinaemia associated with the sepsis is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence which suggests that the adrenal gland contains the renin-angiotensin cycle. The localization of renin has been reported to be mainly in the zona glomerulosa rather than the fasciculata medullary portion. In the present study we have investigated extracts from aldosteronomas (n = 3), which are believed to derive from the zona glomerulosa cells. In addition, we have attempted to characterize the biochemical properties of the adrenal renin. Sizable quantities of renin-like activity (32.0 +/- 7.7 ng of angiotensin I generated h-1 mg-1 of protein, mean +/- SEM) were detected in the extracts. This renin-like activity was inhibited by anti-renin antibody raised against pure renin (mean, 95% of the total renin-like activity), indicating that it was not due to the non-specific action of proteases such as cathepsin D. The optimum pH of the tissue renin-like enzyme was 6.0 for rat plasma substrate. Differences were found, however, in the molecular mass (36,000, 37,000, 44,000 and 48,000), binding to concanavalin A and isoelectric points (4.40, 4.68 and 5.00). These results confirm the existence of specific renin in aldosteronoma. Renin microheterogeneity could be evidence for local production of the enzyme.\r"

Thirty minutes after the intravenous injection of soluble insulin (0.15 unit/kg body weight), a significant reduction in blood glucose concentration (control: 5.26 +/- 0.19 SEM mmol/l; insulin: 1.48 +/- 0.44 mmol/l; P less than 0.001) was associated with a rise in heart rate (mean peak rise 29 +/- 8 beats/min, P less than 0.05), systolic arterial blood pressure (mean peak rise 28 +/- 4 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentration (control: 20 +/- 7 pmol/l; insulin: 287 +/- 66 pmol/l; P less than 0.01). These events coincided with a short period of jejunal motor activity, which was not associated with gastric motor activity nor with raised plasma motilin concentrations. During the control study, there were no changes in blood glucose concentration, heart rate, arterial blood pressure or plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentrations, and there was no jejunal motor activity. The interval between successive gastric migrating motor complexes (MMC) was not significantly different in the insulin and control studies (control: median interval 110 min, range 108-148 min; insulin: median interval 124 min, range 115-125 min), suggesting that the fasting gastrojejunal MMC and jejunal motor activity arose independently. Insulin-induced hypoglycaemia is accompanied by jejunal motor activity, which may underlie the abdominal symptoms associated with hypoglycaemia.\r"

Donors were given 0.5 g/kg of 10% dextran-40 during surgery and electrolyte solutions averaging 3032 ml/24 h. Recipients were randomized to receive albumin or dextran-40 infusions and given 0.5 g/kg during surgery. Electrolyte and 5% glucose infusions averaged 5580 ml/24 h, to match the urinary output. Total intravascular albumin (TIA) and total intravascular dextran (TID) were calculated from the plasma concentrations and plasma volume (PV). Mean preoperative PV in the donors was 44.5 ml/kg. The TIA loss of 0.37 g/kg was balanced by a TID of 0.27 g/kg, and PV increased to 46 and 49 ml/kg at 3 and 34 h after surgery, respectively. In recipients, the preoperative volume of extracellular water correlated linearly to the total body water and PV, as well as to the urine flow the first 24 h after transplantation. No difference was found in urine volume, serum creatinine, or PV expansion between recipient patients receiving albumin or dextran-40. Twelve patients with immediate urinary onset had blood volume (BV) and PV of more than 70 and 45 ml/kg, respectively, in sharp contrast to five patients with delayed urinary onset, who had lower BV and PV values. A fall in TIA of 0.9 g/kg at 3 h corresponded to a PV loss of 18 ml/kg and was only partially replaced by the 0.5 g/kg of intraoperative colloids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Minimizing work of breathing (WOB) during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is important as it facilitates weaning from mechanical ventilation. To minimize WOB, we devised a simple, continuous-flow CPAP-IMV system that uses a weighted, partially filled reservoir bag and operates efficiently at low fresh gas flow (FGF). We compared both the pattern and WOB of our system (FGF at 15 L/min) with a conventional continuous-flow CPAP/IMV system (FGF at 15 and 30 L/min) as well as with two relatively efficient demand-value systems, the Servo 900 B and 900 C. Six healthy male subjects were studied; tidal volumes (VT), flow, mouth pressure, and pleural pressure (Ppl) were measured. Ten breaths, matched for VT, from each subject on each system were selected for analysis. Mechanical WOB was estimated by integrating Ppl with respect to VT. The conventional continuous-flow system was associated with a high work/breath relative to the other systems (p less than .001). The weighted reservoir system was associated with a significantly lower work/breath (p less than .001), its performance approaching that of the Servo 900B. Work/breath was least with the Servo 900C (p less than .001). As breathing frequency was higher with the demand valve than continuous-flow systems (p less than .001), the difference in work/time was minimal between the weighted reservoir bag and demand-valve systems. These systems were all associated with significantly (p less than .001) lower work/time than the conventional system at both FGF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both groups, norepinephrine infusion increased systolic, diastolic and mean aortic BP, cardiac index, stroke index, index of myocardial contractility, and mean pulmonary artery pressure. No significant change in right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, or pulmonary vascular resistance was observed. Oxygen consumption index and oxygen extraction ratio remained unchanged. Increases in systolic aortic BP were dose-related, whereas maximal effects on other variables were obtained at 0.5 to 1 microgram/kg X min. The rise in aortic pressure resulted from an increased cardiac index but not from an increased systemic vascular resistance. Stroke index increased as contractility improved. The slight alpha-adrenergic effect of continuous, low-dose norepinephrine infusion did not impede the beneficial effects of the marked beta-adrenergic stimulation on cardiac function. The combination of these two effects improved hemodynamic disturbances of hyperdynamic endotoxic canine shock.\r"

However, comparison of results between EIC whole blood and plasma values demonstrates a significant proportional bias that is inversely related to the sample's hematocrit. The EIC method for whole blood samples may substantially underestimate theophylline levels in polycythemic patients with theophylline values near or above the toxic range and underestimate levels in those with anemia, if a correction is not made for the sample's hematocrit. A correction formula to approximate plasma theophylline concentrations from whole blood measurements is described.\r"

Four patients were managed at home with the use of portable volume ventilators. One patient employed the technique while hospitalized with subacute respiratory failure. Two patients, otherwise dependent on mouth intermittent positive pressure ventilation (MIPPV) 24 hours a day, received necessary dental care with NIPPV support. In a large population with a decade or more follow-up, MIPPV was shown to be an effective noninvasive technique to support respiration in patients with the most severe paralytic respiratory failure. Preliminary observations suggest that NIPPV may compare favorably with MIPPV and deserves more widespread study and application.\r"

At rest (N = 36) and at exercise (N = 21) there was no difference in the respective measurements of cardiac output (Qc = 6.0 +/- 1.7 and CORNA = 6.9 +/- 2.5 at rest; Qc = 13.7 +/- 3.2 and CORNA = 14.5 +/- 4.1 at exercise, L/min, mean +/- SD, r = .80). Mild maldistribution of ventilation, as manifested by an increased phase 3 alveolar slope for methane (CH4 slope), did not significantly influence the results. CH4 slope and DLexh did increase significantly with exercise, while total lung capacity remained unchanged (CH4 slope: 6.2 +/- 5.0 vs 12.5 +/- 6.8% delta CH4/L, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001; Dsb: 27.7 +/- 9.2 vs 42.0 +/- 17.9 ml/min/mm Hg, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001; TLC: 5.47 +/- .20 vs 5.96 +/- 1.20 L, mean +/- SD). DLexh was related to CORNA (r = .68) and RNA stroke volume (r = .50). Qc was significantly less than CORNA in the subset of studies with valvular regurgitation (VHD) (N = 7). On the other hand, Qc was significantly greater than CORNA in the setting of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe wall motion abnormalities (N = 7). These differences may be attributed to regurgitant fractions in VHD, and the influence of wall motion abnormalities on the estimation of left ventricular volume by the area-length method in CAD. These two noninvasive methods compare well at rest and exercise in clinical subjects and may provide complementary information in certain cardiopulmonary diseases.\r"

Improved dosing strategies for beta 2 agonists may improve the efficacy of these agents in the future.\r"

Breathlessness is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and often is the reason that the individual patient seeks medical attention. In order to evaluate the different clinical studies involving the use of theophylline in COPD patients, it is important to consider the three distinct approaches for measuring dyspnea--psychophysical testing, clinical methods, and ratings during exercise. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-theophylline trials from one to four weeks in duration have evaluated the impact of theophylline on lung function and breathlessness. In these studies, the overall improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second was quite consistent for theophylline compared with placebo therapy. When appropriate clinical methods for measuring dyspnea were used, theophylline showed a positive reduction in breathlessness. These reports suggest that theophylline provides modest objective and subjective improvement in patients with symptomatic chronic air flow obstruction.\r"

Indirect evidence suggests that airway inflammation is an important determinant in the long-term outcome of chronic obstructive airway disease.

The drug may directly and indirectly mediate the increase in the secretory output of bronchial glands, and this effect is enhanced by the vagal gastropulmonary reflex which is stimulated by the irritant action of theophylline on the stomach. Theophylline can increase the transepithelial secretion of fluid into the respiratory tract lumen by stimulating the chloride pump which is controlled by cyclic AMP. Ciliary motility is stimulated by theophylline; most of this effect is confined to the proximal part of the respiratory tree. However, much of the improvement in mucociliary clearance may be a consequence of the bronchodilation induced by theophylline, since the improved airway patency is generally a prerequisite for enhanced mucokinesis. Nevertheless, the multiple sites of action of theophylline in the respiratory tract suggests that this drug should be considered to be of significant value in any disorder characterized by mucostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The bronchodilating action of theophylline in COPD has been examined, with emphasis on its combined use with inhaled beta 2 agonists. The suggestion is made that failure to recognize the nonlinearity of the dose-response curves for bronchodilators has resulted in underestimating their combined action. Recent studies suggest that systemic theophylline has somewhat different actions on the airways in COPD than inhaled beta agonists, and that more bronchodilation may be possible when the two are used together than large doses of either one. By analogy, with asthma the suggestion is also made that the addition of theophylline is also likely to provide a more constant bronchodilation, reducing peak-trough variations in flow. The most complete clinical comparison to date suggests that, in currently sanctioned doses, a regimen containing both theophylline and an inhaled beta 2 agonist provides significantly greater bronchodilation than either drug alone, with fewer patient withdrawals. Further carefully designed studies are needed to resolve this issue, and particularly, to identify those patients who will derive the greatest benefit from a combined regimen.\r"

  ".W": "The epithelial expression of carbohydrate antigen, stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) was examined immunohistochemically in noncancerous specimens from patients with familial polyposis coli, and compared with the colorectal epithelia from patients with sporadic colorectal cancer. In mucosa remote from carcinoma of sporadic cases, SSEA-1 was expressed only faintly in the lower crypts. In mucosa adjacent to carcinoma of sporadic cases, SSEA-1 was expressed not only in the lower crypts but also in the upper crypts. These results corresponded to those observed in the authors' previous study. In the flat mucosa of familial polyposis coli cases, SSEA-1 was detected not only in the lower crypts, but also in both upper crypts and the surface epithelium in contrast with the flat mucosa of sporadic cases. The staining pattern in the upper crypts of the flat mucosa of familial polyposis coli cases was very similar to that of the mucosa adjacent to carcinoma of sporadic cases, but was stronger and more diffuse in the surface epithelium. In microscopic adenomas, SSEA-1 was expressed diffusely. These results demonstrate that the flat mucosa of patients with familial polyposis coli shows preneoplastic changes similar to those in the mucosa adjacent to carcinoma of sporadic cases, and that SSEA-1 is related to adenoma formation in the early stage of carcinogenesis in the colorectum. In addition, the results suggest that immunohistochemical studies of flat mucosa may be useful for the early detection of high-risk individuals in a familial polyposis coli family.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 93 patients with middle and lower rectal cancer, who underwent potentially curative surgery by low anterior resection (LAR) with EEA stapled anastomosis or by abdominoperineal excision (APE) between January 1977 and December 1981, the incidence of recurrence and survival rate was compared. LAR with stapler was performed in 61 patients: 55 (90.2 percent) with tumors of the middle third and six (9.8 percent) for tumors of the lower third of the rectum. APE was performed in 32 patients: 13 (40.6 percent) with cancer of the midrectum and 19 (59.4 percent) of the lower rectum. Tumor site, Dukes' distribution, grade of malignancy, and extent of local spread were recorded. The tumor stages for LAR with stapler and for APE, respectively, were Dukes' A 7/1; Dukes' B 27/10; Dukes' C 25/18; Dukes' D 2/3. In a follow-up period of four years (range, 6 to 52 months) the overall recurrence rates were 20.4 percent in the LAR with stapled anastomosis group and 21 percent in the APE group. Local recurrence percentages were 9.8 percent after LAR and 14 percent after APE (P = N.S.). Distant recurrences were 12 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The four-year overall survival rates were 76.7 percent after LAR and 65.5 percent after APE (P = N.S.) The clinical and pathologic factors correlated with recurrence in low rectal carcinoma were reanalyzed and the controversial points of the surgical management for and against LAR with stapled anastomosis and APE were discussed. It is concluded that LAR with the EEA stapler can be carried out in the middle and lower rectum with the prospect of ultimate cure, when performed with proper technical skills in selected patients.\r"

Fifteen patients experienced seepage of stool and 25 had gross incontinence. In nine patients, reconstruction of the external sphincter was by overlap of the muscle ends. Twenty-four others underwent accurate approximation of the external sphincter muscle and anterior plication of the levator muscles, and in seven the anal canal was made smaller by narrowing the anal orifice. Follow-up was an average of 67 months after operation (range, 2.4 to 166 months). Continence was objectively improved in 62 percent (P less than .01) when performance criteria were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test, although 85 percent of the patients reported subjective improvement.

Two patients (8 percent) had recurrent appendicitis, and late sequelae were observed in four patients, three of these after surgery. Ultrasonically guided percutaneous drainage of appendiceal abscesses with the technique described is indicated whenever feasible, as a safe, gentle, and relatively atraumatic procedure with few complications and late sequelae.\r"

Forty-one patients enrolled because they were refractory to or had side effects during conventional therapy with sulfasalazine or corticosteroids. Proctoscopic examination was done before and after two weeks of treatment. Patients kept daily diaries assessing: blood in stools, mucus in stools, tenesmus, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss, and malaise. Severity of each symptom ranged from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). A total severity score was calculated from the above for each patient. At the end of the two-week study, 35 patients elected to take 4-ASA in an open-label trial for one year. 4-ASA enemas in the 1-g bid but not the 2-g bid dosage were significantly more effective in improving symptoms than placebo: P less than or equal to 0.05. Neither dose of 4-ASA enema was better than placebo in improving the sigmoidoscopic appearance at the end of two-weeks. Forty-six percent of patients had complete resolution of all signs and symptoms in the open-label trial and 31% were better but still had sigmoidoscopic evidence of disease, a total response rate of 77%. Side effects were similar in the placebo and 4-ASA groups. We conclude that 4-ASA enemas in a dose of 1 g bid are safe and effective in the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis.\r"

Cognitive scores increased from 5.3 +/- 1.6 to 5.8 +/- 1.6 in the education group, but there was no change in the control group, whose score was 5.3 +/- 1.7 before and after the intervention (P = .0073).

The fasting blood glucose decreased from 223 +/- 94 to 179 +/- 73 mg/dl in the education group and from 199 +/- 81 to 185 +/- 76 mg/dl in the controls (P = .1983). Triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin dosage also failed to show significant variation among groups. The foot-lesion score showed similar progression in the education and control groups. Neither diastolic nor systolic blood pressure showed significantly greater change in the education or the control group, with falls noted, particularly in diastolic pressures, in both patient groups. Differences between the groups were not significant for sick days, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or outpatient visits. The sample sizes of the study and control populations were sufficiently large to detect a difference in means between the education and control groups in the HbA1c, the primary outcome variable, of greater than 1.0%, with alpha = .05 and a power of .95. Thus, our study suggests that patient education may not be an efficacious therapeutic intervention in most adults with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus.\r"

A sample of 1370 of the 5431 individuals was examined as part of this study. An index of glucose control could be derived for 568 of 674 people using insulin and for 565 of 696 nonusers of insulin. Correlation of the index with the glycosylated hemoglobin obtained at the time of study was significant in insulin users and nonusers. Patients with the poorest blood glucose control as described by index of past control or by current glycosylated hemoglobin had higher rates of retinopathy compared with patients who had the best control. When both the index of past control and current glycosylated hemoglobin values were combined, rate ratios for retinopathy for people with poorest control compared with those with best control were slightly better than when each measure was used alone. These analyses suggest that in planning programs, health-care impact may be increased if past and current data are considered.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic relationship of glucose concentrations and insulin secretion during the postabsorptive state is complex and has been associated with a variety of cyclic rhythms. To study the pattern of insulin and glucose response immediately after a mixed meal, we collected blood every 15 min from 0730 to 1645 h from eight normal resting men (age 24.9 +/- 2.1 yr). They took identically constituted mixed meals at 0800 and 1145 h. Concentrations of glucose and insulin were measured in samples taken throughout the study, whereas levels of C-peptide, glucagon, and alpha-NH2 were determined in samples taken after 1130 h only. Computer-assisted analysis was used to identify significant increments and declines in concentrations and to quantify the coincidence of peaks of glucose, C-peptide, glucagon, and alpha-NH2 with peaks of insulin. Coefficients of correlation between data points were calculated for each individual. The patterns of blood insulin and glucose after breakfast and lunch were different. After breakfast, a single simultaneous peak in insulin and glucose occurred approximately 60 min after starting the meal. In contrast, the pattern after lunch in seven of the eight subjects was clearly biphasic. There were secondary, significant coincident peaks in serum insulin, glucose, and C-peptide occurring 1.75-2.25 h after the meal was served. The secondary peak appeared unrelated to the late absorption of protein because it was not associated with consistent changes in serum alpha-NH2 concentration. Erratic variations characterized the postlunch pattern of glucagon levels, excluding a role for this counterregulatory hormone in the control of the biphasic insulin and glucose response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each IDDM patient (n = 8) was treated for 2 mo by MI (HS Ultralente and AC boluses of regular insulin) and for 2 mo by CSII in a randomized fashion. Prestudy preprandial/postprandial blood glucose levels were 199 +/- 33/261 +/- 28 mg/dl and improved to 124 +/- 12/156 +/- 13 mg/dl during MI and to 115 +/- 11/151 +/- 11 mg/dl during CSII. Glycosylated hemoglobin before the study was 10.1 +/- 0.5% and decreased to 8.8 +/- 0.4 and 8.3 +/- 0.3% during MI and CSII, respectively. The specific 125I-labeled insulin binding to circulating monocytes in a group of nonobese controls (n = 17) was 4.6 +/- 0.2%. In our poorly controlled diabetics during conventional therapy, the 125I-insulin binding was decreased to 3.7 +/- 0.3 (P less than .025). This was not significantly affected by MI despite good glucose control (4.0 +/- 0.3%). With CSII, however, good glucose control was associated with normalization of 125I-insulin binding to monocytes (4.7 +/- 0.27%). The affinity of the insulin receptors was normal before the study and was not affected by either MI or CSII. In conclusion, these observations demonstrate that in IDDM, intensive therapy by MI and CSII resulted in similar good glucose control, but only CSII resulted in normalization of insulin receptors on circulating monocytes.\r"

Study subjects were skin tested with 15 different insulins, and the results were evaluated over 48 h. All control subjects and 41 of 46 diabetic patients without local reactions were skin-test negative to insulin. The 11% of diabetic patients who reacted had positive wheal-and-flare reactions at 20 min to animal-species insulin but negative skin tests to human insulin. Study revealed two subgroups of patients with histories of local reactions. Ten (48%) of these patients had negative skin tests to insulin. Five of this subgroup remained skin-test negative to quantities of less than or equal to 8 U insulin/skin test. Eleven (52%) of the patients formed a subgroup with positive insulin skin tests; most of these patients were skin-test positive to human insulin and to beef, pork, or both insulins as well. Although the group mean insulin-specific IgE values of this latter subgroup were significantly higher than those of any other study group, overlap of these individual IgE values did not allow separation of specific individuals with positive skin tests from those of patients on insulin without dermal reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, we randomly assigned 112 newly diagnosed, untreated, insulin-dependent diabetic children to therapy with either pure porcine or partially purified bovine/porcine insulin. They were followed for 1 yr, data being available on at least 90 subjects at each visit. More skin reactions were found in the group treated with the bovine/porcine insulin. This insulin was of higher antigenicity, and binding of radiolabeled insulin (mean +/- SE) by serum from bovine/porcine insulin treatment was 35.5 +/- 2.6 versus 16.8 +/- 1.4% (P less than .001) for pure porcine insulin treatment 12 mo after initiation of insulin therapy. However, throughout the 12 mo of observation the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin dosage, fasting plasma glucose, and C-peptide concentration were similar for the groups. Reported incidences of hypoglycemia and nocturia were also similar. Thus, insulin-antibody formation and skin reactions were minimized by the use of pure porcine versus partially purified bovine/porcine insulin, but no other clinical advantages were apparent.\r"

Physical stability was assessed by ultraviolet absorption, chemical stability by HPLC, and biological stability by hypoglycemia tests in mice. Insulin precipitated in glass vials but remained clear and active in polyethylene reservoirs and after passage through catheter and pumps in motion, although only 83-90% of insulin was delivered chemically intact. In acidic solvent, insulin showed a major gradual transformation into deamidized derivatives (up to 78% after 8 wk), although still fully active and clear, as expected from previously published excellent in vivo results with acidic insulins. Heparin addition to neutral insulin solution (500 IU/ml) did not alter the properties of the two compounds and might thus be tried to prevent in vivo catheter obstruction due to fibrin deposition.\r"

The perfused insulin solutions were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Although no plasticizer, e.g., dioctyl phthalate, or nickel or chromium ions were found in the perfusates, substantial interactions between the plastics and the insulin solutions were detected, extraction of bacteriostatic additives from the insulin solutions in particular. The PVC retained up to 88% of the bacteriostatics from the insulin preparations, whereas PE tubings retained only 10-15%. Whether the loss of preservatives during perfusion through PVC catheters predisposes to cutaneous infections during insulin-pump therapy remains to be shown.\r"

Our review of this literature has identified specific problems relevant to patient care, future research, and public policy. For example, proliferative retinopathy often leads to at least partial visual impairment, psychiatric symptoms, and difficulties with glycemic control. Partial visual impairment appears to cause as much psychosocial disruption as severe blindness. This suggests that most rehabilitation programs that serve the legally blind may come too late in the course of this illness. This review emphasizes the paucity of past research on psychosocial aspects of diabetic retinopathy and raises some questions for future research.\r"

Occasionally, effective modes of therapy must be withdrawn because of undesirable pulmonary side effects, putting patients at risk for potentially lethal diseases. Pulmonary parenchymal damage due to drugs is an especially troublesome problem because irreversible pulmonary disease may occur. Mechanisms of pulmonary parenchymal tissue damage by drugs are unclear. It appears that some drugs induce direct tissue injury in addition to indirect tissue damage through amplification of pulmonary inflammation; other drugs cause pulmonary alterations solely through indirect mechanisms. Common clinical syndromes associated with drug-induced pulmonary parenchymal disease include pneumonitis/fibrosis, hypersensitivity lung disease, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Less common patterns of pulmonary parenchymal injury by drugs include bronchiolitis obliterans and a pulmonary renal syndrome. Risk factors for pulmonary injury due to pharmacologic agents are partially defined but not entirely understood. To date, there are no adequate tests for early detection of pulmonary damage by drugs, although research into this area is active. This review discusses mechanisms and clinical features of drug-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury to aid the clinician in recognizing and understanding these syndromes.\r"

Intravenous injection of CCK-8 did not affect basal plasma PRL levels in doses up to 5000 ng/rat; however, plasma PRL increased significantly after intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of the peptide at a dose of 40 ng/rat. Proglumide (0.2 mg/kg, iv) and benzotript (0.2 mg/kg, iv), specific CCK receptor antagonists, blocked the icv CCK-8-induced increase in plasma PRL levels. There was no apparent effect of icv CCK-8 on the enhancement of PRL release by haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg, iv), sulpiride (0.1 mg/kg, iv), domperidone (0.1 mg/kg, iv), or RO22-1319 (0.1 mg/kg, iv). However, the apomorphine-induced inhibition of PRL secretion was significantly antagonized by icv CCK-8. Furthermore, icv CCK-8 increased plasma PRL levels in rats depleted of dopamine by pretreatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. Finally, the elevation in plasma PRL levels produced by icv CCK-8 was substantially antagonized by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide antiserum (1:3; 10 microliter/rat, icv). These results suggest that CCK-8 increases plasma PRL through an interaction with a central CCK receptor, which stimulates the activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, a putative PRL-releasing factor.\r"

  ".U": "87246356\r", 
  ".W": "Immunochemical treatments for the recovery of viable GnRH neurons from adult male rats have previously been described by this laboratory. In the present report, efforts were made to limit cellular adhesion, as well as the proteolytic and mechanical damage which occurred during isolation of the neurons, in order to determine if such damage may account for failure of the isolated cells to exhibit spontaneous neuropeptide release. These modifications prevented the loss of assayable GnRH during the isolation process, and neurons recovered from individual rats in this study contained 10.7 +/- 2.5 ng GnRH. Further, all isolated neuronal preparations exhibited spontaneous peptide release which continued in a regular repetitive manner. When maintained in closed chambers, these preparations released 105 +/- 42 pg/ml biologically active GnRH at 18.9 +/- 0.4-min intervals. In contrast, GnRH release from heterologous preparations was characterized by erratic low level pulses. The results from this work suggest that independent neuroendocrine properties of GnRH neurons may be responsible for tonic gonadotropin secretion in castrated adult male rats and that the erratic patterns of gonadotropin release in gonadally intact males may be related, in part, to coupling between GnRH neurons and unidentified neuronal factors.\r"

Neurons harvested from individual rats were treated with a single steroid pulse; samples were collected before treatment, during the steroid pulse, and at 24 h post treatment. Androgen treatments of 100 pg/ml or 1 ng/ml media elicited an increase in GnRH pulse frequency 1-6 min after steroid exposure without affecting the amplitude of release; these modalities persisted at 2 h. The frequency of GnRH pulses was increased 24 h after the neurons received the brief 100 pg/ml or 1 ng/ml T or 1 ng/ml DHT treatments. Neurons exposed to androgen treatments also appeared to express large amplitude GnRH pulses infrequently at this time whereas there was no androgen affect on the cellular GnRH concentration. In contrast, E(2)17 beta, OHE1, and P4 treatments had no affect on the mean media GnRH concentration, baseline GnRH concentration, or on the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses at any time point. However, the 1 ng/ml P4 and the 1 ng/ml OHE1 treatments both reduced cellular GnRH content at 48 h post treatment. These results suggest that T and DHT may specifically interact with GnRH neurons to elicit immediate and/or long-term changes in the modalities of neuropeptide release and that under physiological conditions GnRH neurons of adult male rats are not directly influenced by E(2)17 beta, the catecholestrogen OHE1, or P4.\r"

Insulin replacement in diabetic rats returned both parameters to control values. Minipump-induced hyperinsulinemia or injection of glucagon antiserum, T3, or propylthiouracil had no effect. The results of this study indicate that conditions which lead to an elevation of the glucagon to insulin molar ratio to values higher than 1.0 cause a significant decrease in the liver phosphorylase protein level.\r"

  ".U": "87246365\r", 
  ".W": "Synthesis-secretion coupling of insulin was measured in four age groups of perfused pancreases taken from Sprague-Dawley rats ranging in age from 2-12 months. The effect of long term (6 h) near-maximal glucose stimulation (300 mg/dl) on both insulin secretion and net insulinogenesis demonstrated an age-related increase in both parameters. Net insulinogenesis as well as total insulin secretion increased linearly as a function of aging. Compared to that in 2-month-old rats, total net insulin synthesis was more than 3-fold greater in 12-month-old rats, slightly less than 3-fold greater in 8-month-old rats, and twice as much in 4-month-old rats. Compared to that in 2-month-old rats, total glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was 3-fold greater in 12-month-old rats, approximately 2.2-fold greater in 8-month-old rats, and about 1.7-fold greater in 4-month-old rats. A shorter term (90 min) glucose stimulation at 150 mg/dl produced an age-related increase in insulin secretion which was relatively comparable to the higher glucose stimulus. Of equal importance is that fact that pancreases from the older rats exhibited the same degree of secretory responsiveness to changing glucose levels as did pancreases from the younger rats. Regardless of age, first phase insulin secretion was approximately twice as much in response to the higher glucose level as to the lower. Similarly, second phase insulin secretion was almost 3 times greater regardless of age. When normalized and reported in terms of insulin content, total insulin secretion was no different as a function of aging during the first 1 h of glucose stimulation (i.e. the first two phases of secretion), but it was significantly elevated in the third secretory phase (2-6 h) by the older rat groups. Total 6-h net insulinogenesis was also greater in the older rat groups. When normalized and reported in terms of total body weight, both insulin synthesis and total insulin secretion became comparable and showed no specific age-related difference. Thus, there is no indication that aging results in an uncoupling of relatively long term (6-h) insulin synthesis-secretion, since both glucose-induced responses parallel one another as a function of aging. Furthermore, reporting insulin secretion and synthesis on the basis of body weight, rather than age, totally normalizes synthesis-secretion coupling of insulin.\r"

Dexamethasone decreased insulin binding to intact cell monolayers in a dose and time-dependent fashion. The effect is maximal between 48 and 72 h with 50 nM dexamethasone that decreased binding by 40-60%. The natural steroid corticosterone produced a similar effect although it was less potent, and the antiglucocorticoid 17 alpha-methyltestosterone was ineffective in lowering the receptor and partially antagonized the effect of dexamethasone. Total number of binding sites was decreased by glucocorticoids, and when analyzed with a two-site model a 3-fold increase in the dissociation constant (Kd) of the low affinity site was also observed. In the absence of protein synthesis the receptor accumulates at the cell surface, since cycloheximide produced a large increase of insulin binding. Cycloheximide totally blocked the effect of dexamethasone when both compounds were added together to the cells suggesting that protein synthesis is necessary for the effect of the glucocorticoid. By contrast, in cells pretreated with dexamethasone, cycloheximide was unable to produce an increase in cell surface receptor, showing that glucocorticoids probably deplete not only membrane receptor but also total cellular receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A cell-free system was used to characterize the binding reaction between the progesterone receptor and nuclear acceptor sites prepared from rat placenta. Two forms of receptor-acceptor complex were examined. One was extracted from nuclei by exposure to 0.6 M KCl; the other type was resistant to salt extraction. Kinetic analysis indicated that the binding reactions were saturable (3-4 pmol binding sites/mg DNA) and of high affinity (Kd = 3-6 nM). Acceptor binding was specific for placental nuclei and did not occur with nuclei prepared from spleen or with denatured nuclei from placenta. Acceptor sites were further characterized by their sensitivity to RNase, DNase I, and protease. RNase treatment had no influence on receptor-acceptor binding. However, DNase I reduced the number of KCl-resistant acceptor sites by 41%, but only a 19% reduction occurred in KCl-extractable acceptor sites (P less than 0.05). Protease removed 34% and 48% of the KCl-resistant and -extractable acceptor sites, respectively, and combined treatment with DNase and protease eliminated 76% of acceptor-binding activity. The endogenous inhibitor previously described from rat placental cytosol blocked acceptor-binding sites in a concentration-dependent manner, a decrease of 1.15 pmol sites/mg inhibitor protein for resistant sites and 0.76 pmol/mg inhibitor protein for extractable sites. However, receptor-acceptor binding was not altered by treating nuclei with actinomycin D or chloroquine. Mercurial reagents reduced receptor-acceptor interaction by 80% and 94% in KCl-resistant and -extractable sites, respectively, whereas sulfhydryl alkylating agents reduced binding 35% and 76%. Pyridoxal phosphate destroyed 88-93% of acceptor binding. The results of these studies suggest that the progesterone receptor acceptor sites are composed of a complex of chromatin protein and DNA in rat placenta. Furthermore, the binding reaction requires the participation of sulfhydryl and terminal amino groups.\r"

  ".W": "High affinity binding sites for galanin are identified and characterized in membranes from a hamster pancreatic beta-cell tumor. Using the radioiodinated peptide [125I] galanin, interaction of the peptide with pancreatic membranes is shown to be saturable, reversible, and time, temperature, membrane protein concentration, pH, and ionic strength dependent. In optimized equilibrium conditions of binding (90 min at 10 C), native galanin competitively inhibits the binding of [125I]galanin in a dose-dependent manner (from 10(-11)-10(-8) M); half-maximal inhibition is induced by 1 nM peptide. Scatchard analysis indicates the existence of a single population of sites of high affinity (Kd = 1.5 nM) and low capacity (44 fmol/mg protein). The monophasic dissociation process confirms the homogeneity of galanin-binding sites. Galanin-binding sites are highly specific, since apart from native galanin, none of the numerous biologically active peptides tested competes with [125I] galanin for binding to pancreatic membranes. The cross-linking of [125I]galanin to beta-cell membranes is performed using the chemical bifunctional reagent ethylene glycol bis-(succinimidyl succinate). After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol, one single band of 57,000 mol wt is observed, which may be corresponding to the [125I]galanin-receptor complex. Indeed, labeling of this 57,000 mol wt component is abolished only by native galanin but is unaffected by various other digestive peptides. Assuming one molecule of [125I]galanin is bound per molecule of protein, a 54,000 mol wt protein is identified as the pancreatic galanin receptor. In conclusion, our results indicate for the first time the identification of galanin receptors. Their presence in pancreatic beta-cells suggests a direct role of galanin in regulating endocrine beta-cell function.\r"

A 69-amino acid (aa) LHRH precursor comprised of the decapeptide, a 3-aa cleavage and amidation site, and a 56-aa C-terminal extension has recently been characterized. Two antisera generated to specific aa sequences of the C-terminal extension (RM 8/5, anti aa 14-26; PS 39A, anti aa 40-53) and two directed to specific regions of the LHRH decapeptide (RM 1076, anti aa 4-8; A 422 generated to the N-terminal pGlu and C-terminal amidated Gly) were used to further examine intraneuronal sites of precursor processing. Patterns of immunoreactivity revealed with antisera directed to non-LHRH sequences of LHRH precursor paralleled those observed with antisera to the decapeptide. Immunopositive perikarya, processes, and neurovascular terminals were observed with PS 39A. Antiserum PS 39A binds to an internal aa sequence of the C-terminal extension and would, therefore, be expected to detect intact precursor LHRH as well as products of proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, only immunopositive processes and neurovascular terminals were observed with RM 8/5, an antiserum directed to an initial aa sequence of the C-terminal extension. The pattern of immunoreactivity revealed with RM 8/5 resembled that observed with an antiserum that binds the fully processed decapeptide (A 422), indicating that proteolytic cleavage of the decapeptide from the C-terminal extension is required for binding by this antiserum. Furthermore, the restricted distribution of reaction product observed with RM 8/5 relative to A 422 suggests that additional processing of the C-terminal extension may be required for binding. Such additional processing appears to occur in neurovascular terminals of the median eminence.\r"

  ".W": "Although hyperprolactinemia has been reported to decrease reproductive function in male rats, the mechanism of these effects is not fully understood. We examined the effects of chronic hyperprolactinemia and castration on the LHRH content of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and on the basal and evoked in vitro release of LHRH from the MBH-preoptic area (POA). Adult Wistar-Furth male rats were inoculated with MtTW15 tumor fragments; 3 weeks later half of the rats were castrated. Hyperprolactinemic (H) and normoprolactinemic (N) rats were decapitated 2 weeks later to measure MBH LHRH and serum PRL and LH levels. Elevated PRL levels (greater than 2 micrograms/ml) resulted in significantly increased MBH LHRH stores. Castration caused a 57% depletion of MBH LHRH in N rats; in castrated H rats the MBH LHRH content was also reduced by 40%, a significantly lesser extent. Although serum LH levels in intact H rats were only slightly reduced, postcastration LH hypersecretion was significantly attenuated. In a parallel study, the LHRH release rate was assessed by in vitro perfusion of the MBH-POA. The basal LHRH release rates of intact N and H rats were similar. Castrated N rats released LHRH at a reduced rate (50%; P less than 0.01), whereas in castrated H rats the LHRH release rate was reduced by 20%, which corresponded with the partial depletion of the MBH LHRH content in these rats. To examine the possibility of opiate involvement, LHRH release evoked by two consecutive naloxone (NAL) infusions (1 mg/ml for 30 min) was studied. The two NAL infusions resulted in two similar significant increments of LHRH in the MBH-POA of intact N and H rats. However, castration produced different effects on the NAL-induced LHRH release. First, the second NAL pulse was not effective in stimulating LHRH release from the MBH-POA of N and H castrated rats. Further, the first NAL infusion elicited a significant increase in LHRH output from the MBH-POA of N and H castrated rats, but it was significantly lower in comparison with that in their respective intact counterparts. In addition, the NAL-induced LHRH response was higher from the MBH-POA of castrated H than that in castrated N rats. These studies show that neither basal nor evoked LHRH output in vitro is affected by severe and chronic hyperprolactinemia produced by MtTW15 pituitary tumor cells in intact male rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three minutes of stimulating the sympathetic nerves (8 Hz, 1 msec, 10 mA, n = 6) surrounding the pancreatic artery decreased both the blood flow in the superior pancreatic vein (SPV) (delta = -1.7 +/- 0.6 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and the basal pancreatic output of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) (delta = -79 +/- 5%, P less than 0.001). SPV levels of NE increased by 683 +/- 177 pg/ml (P less than 0.02). Infusion of NE into the superior pancreatic artery at the low dose of 12 ng/min (n = 6) reproduced this increase of SPV levels of NE (delta = +740 +/- 130 pg/ml; P less than 0.01) and caused a small reduction of SPV blood flow (delta = -1.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min, P less than 0.05), but did not change pancreatic IRI (delta = -26 +/- 16%, NS). The medium dose of NE (120 ng/min, n = 6) reproduced the nerve stimulation-induced decrease of SPV blood flow (delta = -1.5 +/- 0.2 ml/min; P less than 0.01) and increased the SPV NE levels by 6,306 +/- 1,839 pg/ml (P less than 0.02), yet did not decrease pancreatic IRI output (delta = +62 +/- 49%, NS). The high dose of NE (1,200 ng/min, n = 6) produced an extreme increment of SPV NE levels (delta = +180,000 +/- 44,000 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and a much larger reduction of SPV blood flow (delta = -3.7 +/- 0.7 ml/min, P less than 0.01) than did nerve stimulation, yet still did not inhibit insulin output (delta = -13 +/- 46%, NS). Ten minutes of sympathetic nerve stimulation increased the pancreatic output of immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) by 1435 +/- 419 pg/min (P less than 0.02). Pancreatic IRG output increased as well during infusion of NE for 10 min at both 12 ng/min (by 575 +/- 205 pg/min, P less than 0.05) and 120 ng/min (by 718 +/- 231 pg/min, P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "To demonstrate the dependence of fetal pituitary LH secretion endogenous GnRH, we studied the effects of bolus iv administration of a specific GnRH antagonist analog [GnRH-Ant; (N-acetyl-D-p-chloro-Phe1,2,D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10)GnRH] on pulsatile LH release in 10 chronically cannulated ovine fetuses of 104-129 days gestation (term, 147 days). Vehicle alone was given to 13 control fetuses of 107-125 days gestation. Blood samples for LH determination by RIA (NIH LH S16 standard) were taken after injection of either GnRH-Ant (175-300 micrograms dissolved in 1 ml 5% dextrose in water) or vehicle alone for 1.75-5 h. The efficacy of GnRH receptor blockade was then assessed by a bolus iv challenge with 50 micrograms synthetic GnRH. The mean (+/- SEM) observation period per animal was similar for the two groups (3.8 +/- 0.2 h for GnRH-Ant; 3.6 +/- 0.2 h for controls). The frequency of spontaneous pulsatile LH secretion was significantly decreased in the fetuses given GhRH-Ant (2 pulses over 38 h total observation vs. 13 pulses over 47.3 h in control fetuses; P = 0.006). The average interpulse interval was 19.0 h in the GnRH-Ant group compared to 3.6 h in controls. Although the mean pulse amplitude was lower in the GnRH-Ant group (2.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.1 ng/ml for controls), this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.065, by one-tailed t test). The mean peak serum LH concentration in response to the GnRH challenge was significantly blunted in the GnRH-Ant group (4.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 20.6 +/- 1.8 ng/ml for controls; P less than 0.001). These results indicate that GnRH-Ant administration causes a virtual cessation of pulsatile LH discharge. As this GnRH-Ant blocks GnRH action at the receptor level, these data demonstrate that pulsatile LH secretion in the ovine fetus is dependent on endogenous GnRH release as early as 104 days gestation.\r"

The effects of hypophysiotropic peptides, brain-gut peptides, and catecholamines are described in detail. The effects of steroid hormones, and in particular, that of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, are presented. The effect(s) of basic bovine fibroblast growth factor are also described. In 44-2C cells basic fibroblast growth factor selectively regulates the synthesis and secretion of CT, NT, SS, and cAMP. Moreover, basic fibroblast growth factor enhances the responsiveness of 44-2C cells to neurosecretory peptides such as rat hypothalamic GRF. We conclude that the 44-2C cells are a useful in vitro tool to study the cellular mechanism(s) controlling the differential synthesis and secretion of neuropeptides.\r"

  ".W": "Galanin is a novel peptide, widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, including nerve endings surrounding the pancreatic islets. In dogs, galanin infusion has been reported to induce hyperglycemia along with a reduction of circulating insulin. In this work, we have studied the effect of galanin (a 200 ng bolus followed by constant infusion at a concentration of 16.8 ng/ml for 22-24 min) on insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin secretion in the perfused rat pancreas. In addition, we have investigated the effect of galanin (10 and 100 nM) on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rat hepatocytes. In the rat pancreas, galanin infusion marked inhibited unstimulated insulin release as well as the insulin responses to glucose (11 mM), tolbutamide (100 mg/liter) and arginine (5 mM). Galanin failed to alter the glucagon and somatostatin responses to glucose, tolbutamide, and arginine. In isolated rat hepatocytes, galanin did not influence glycogenolysis or glucagon phosphorylase a activity. Gluconeogenesis and the hepatocyte concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were also unaffected by galanin. In conclusion: in the perfused rat pancreas, galanin inhibited insulin secretion without modifying glucagon and somatostatin output, thus pointing to a direct effect of galanin on the B cell; and in rat hepatocytes, galanin did not affect glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis; hence, the reported hyperglycemia induced by exogenous galanin does not seem to be accounted for by a direct effect of this peptide on hepatic glucose production.\r"

In the hypothalamus (Ht), [3H]etorphine bound to specific and saturable sites with a Kd of 2.9 nM. Binding-inhibition studies with [3H]etorphine and unlabeled etorphine-HCl as well as [3H]EKC and unlabeled EKC, revealed high and low affinity binding sites in rat Ht and NIL as well as in the neural lobe of the bovine pituitary gland. [3H]naloxone also bound specifically to two classes of sites in Ht membranes, but to only a single class of low affinity sites in NIL membranes. Specific binding represented 80-90% of total [3H]etorphine binding, about 75% of total [3H]EKC binding, and 45-55% of total [3H]naloxone binding at 22 C in NIL and Ht, respectively. Relative binding potencies derived from Ki values for binding-inhibition studies of [3H]etorphine with opioid peptides and opiates were: NIL, etorphine-HCl greater than dynorphin A greater than naloxone-HCl greater than dynorphin-(1-9) greater than beta-endorphin much greater than alpha-neoendorphin approximately (Leu5)enkephalin approximately DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol); Ht, etorphine HCl greater than naloxone-HCl greater than beta-endorphin greater than dynorphin A much greater than DAGO greater than morphiceptin much greater than (Leu5)enkephalin. Specific [3H]etorphine binding was also demonstrable after preincubation of NIL membranes with DAGO and (Leu5)enkephalin and after preincubation of Ht membranes with morphiceptin and (Leu5)enkephalin; such binding could be displaced by nonradioactive dynorphin A. In addition, [3H]etorphine binding to bovine neural lobe was displaceable by naloxone-HCl, with an ED50 of 43 nM. Specific ligands for sigma-opiate receptors, such as (+)SKF 10,047 (N-allylnorcyclazocine), phencyclidine (PCP), and (-)cyclazocine, displaced specifically bound [3H]etorphine and [3H]EKC from NIL membranes only at high (micromolar) concentrations. However, specific [3H]PCP sites were of higher affinity in NIL and Ht membranes, with similar Kd values of 102 and 190 nM respectively, and different concentrations (0.15 and 1.32 pmol/mg protein, respectively).

At various intervals, islets were acutely fixed and processed for scanning electron microscopy, identification of alpha cells, and measurements of single alpha cell content of calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and sodium (Na) with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. Biphasic glucagon secretion was attended by corresponding biphasic Ca accumulation and a reciprocal, biphasic suppression of K content and acute phase suppression of Na in alpha cells. All secretory and cellular events were preceded by an evanescent upward spike in alpha cell K at 1 min. These results indicate that alpha cell glucagon secretion in response to amino acid mixtures may be initiated by a K signal and is coupled subsequently to phasic changes in alpha cell Ca content. Fluctuations of alpha cell K and Na appear to relate inversely to Ca, suggesting that transmembrane fluxes of the three cations are interrelated.\r"

  ".W": "The immunohistochemical distribution of opioid peptides derived from proenkephalin A in the rat pituitary was studied by indirect immunofluorescence; immunoreactive peptides were also characterized by column chromatography followed by specific RIAs. Nerve terminals in the neural lobe were immunoreactive (ir) for Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe (YGGFMRF), Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Gly-Leu (YGGFMRGL), and met-enkephalin [Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met (YGGFM)]. All cells in the intermediate lobe were ir for YGGFMRF, while only occasional cells exhibited YGGFMRGL-like immunoreactivity, and YGGFM-ir cells were not detected in this lobe. In the anterior lobe, some large ovoid cells, identified as gonadotrophs, were immunoreactive for enkephalins. The number of YGGFMRF-ir cells was larger than the number of YGGFMRGL- and YGGFM-ir cells, and these opioid peptides were present in cells that did not contain beta-endorphin immunoreactivity. Twenty times more YGGFMRF than YGGFMRGL-immunoreactivity was present in the anterior lobe, whereas the neurointermediate lobe obtained 4 times more ir YGGFMRF than YGGFMRGL. Pituitary lobe extracts contained substantial amounts of high mol wt forms of ir YGGFMRF and YGGFMRGL, but not of YGGFM or Leu-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu). Low mol wt ir peptides present in both lobes consisted largely of the authentic peptides when analyzed by HPLC; however, an unidentified YGGFMRF-ir peptide was also detected. The results indicate that the proenkephalin A molecule may be processed differentially in the various compartments of the pituitary gland and that opioid peptides derived from this precursor may have functional roles in all three lobes. The relatively large amount of YGGFMRF immunoreactivity, which was detected both biochemically and immunohistochemically, indicates that YGGFMRF-ir peptides may be important proenkephalin A-derived products in the pituitary gland.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of exogenous estradiol during the mid- to late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle results in premature regression of the corpus luteum. The present study was initiated to identify the site of action of estrogen as well as to determine why administration of estrogen during the early luteal phase of the menstrual cycle does not result in luteolysis. Based upon extant literature, we hypothesized that estrogen and progesterone synergize to promote premature luteal regression. We tested this hypothesis in intact, spontaneously cycling rhesus monkeys by inserting estradiol, progesterone, or estrogen plus progesterone capsules on days 2 through 6 of the luteal phase. Insertion of estrogen or progesterone capsules alone did not advance luteolysis compared with the effect of control empty implants (n = 3). In contrast, insertion of estrogen plus progesterone implants on days 2 through 6 of the luteal phase resulted in a significant lowering of serum progesterone concentrations, and menses was advanced 5-6 days compared with control cycles. On the basis of these findings in spontaneously cycling monkeys, we speculated that estrogen treatment causes luteal regression only in the presence of a progesterone-mediated decrease in LH pulse frequency. To test this hypothesis, we used rhesus monkeys whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion was abolished by either placement of radiofrequency lesions in the mediobasal hypothalamus or transection of the hypothalamic-pituitary stalk. Ovulatory menstrual cycles were restored by pulsatile administration of exogenous synthetic GnRH. Insertion of estradiol capsules during the luteal phase into animals whose gonadotropin pulse frequency was set at either one pulse per h or one pulse per 8 h failed to cause premature luteal regression (n = 4). These findings indicate that whereas estrogen promotes luteal regression in intact, spontaneous cycling rhesus monkeys, it does not do so in animals whose gonadotropin secretion is controlled by exogenous GnRH. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the hypothalamus is a major site of action of estrogen in the initiation of luteal regression in macaques.\r"

Rat anterior pituitary membranes were incubated with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14, washed, and then treated with 100 microM cross-linker, which was activated by exposure to UV light. Gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed a broad band centered at 88,000 mol wt. The appearance of this band was unaffected by dithiothreitol. Competitive inhibition of binding by unlabeled somatostatin resulted in a parallel inhibition of labeling of the 88,000 mol wt protein. The addition of guanine nucleotides in concentrations that inhibit binding similarly inhibited cross-linking. The cross-linked membranes were solubilized in Zwittergent 3-12, a nondenaturing detergent, and the glycosylation pattern of the labeled protein was investigated by incubation with various lectins coupled to agarose. The cross-linked protein was selectively adsorbed by wheat germ agglutinin, and this interaction was blocked by the addition of N,N',N\"-triacetylchitotriose, indicating that the rat anterior pituitary somatostatin receptor is a glycoprotein containing polymeric beta-1-4 linked N-acetylglucosamine groups. The results of this study show that the rat anterior pituitary somatostatin receptor is a glycoprotein of 88,000 mol wt containing no disulfide-linked subunits.\r"

However, the slope for the relationship was increased 2- to 10-fold in animals fed the low phosphorus diets. As observed previously, serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels were inversely related to serum phosphate levels, but the slope for this relationship was deceased in the presence of low SM levels and absent in animals with very low SM levels. These results suggest that SM are required for elevation of serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels in response to phosphate deprivation.\r"

  ".W": "The first series of experiments was performed on control rats. The animals were injected iv with trace amounts of 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose [( 14C]DG) or alpha-[1-14C] aminoisobutyric acid with or without 0.1 U insulin/rat, and calf muscles of the right hindlimb were electrically stimulated to induce 1 contraction/sec. The exercise was discontinued 25 min after the injection, and cellular uptakes of DG or aminoisobutyric acid by soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius muscles in disintegrations per min/mg dry tissue weight were determined. The results of these experiments demonstrated that basal, insulin-induced, and exercise-induced uptakes of glucose and amino acids by muscles are dependent on muscle fiber population, and the stimulatory effects of exercise and insulin on soleus and plantaris muscles, but not gastrocnemius muscles, are synergistic rather than merely additive when both stimuli act together. The second series of experiments was performed in the same manner as the first series, except that the right hindlimb of each rat was denervated 3 days before the experiment. Cellular DG uptakes were determined in soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius muscles of the left (sham) hindlimb, which was always resting, and in corresponding muscles of the right (denervated) limb, which was either resting or exercising. In the resting state, the denervated soleus muscle had normal basal DG uptake, but, unlike sham soleus muscle, did not respond to insulin stimulation. Denervated plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles exhibited 264% and 150% elevations in basal glucose uptake, respectively, compared with corresponding sham muscles. The latter two denervated muscles did respond to insulin, but the hormone-induced increments in DG uptake were 68% and 45%, respectively, lower than in corresponding contralateral sham muscles. Under basal conditions, exercise had no effect on DG uptake by the denervated soleus muscle, but increased uptake by denervated plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles 207% and 778%, respectively. Stimulation of exercising denervated muscles with exogenous insulin did not increase DG uptake by any muscle above the level observed with exercise alone. The results show that manifestations of insulin resistance in denervated muscles depend on muscle fiber population; denervated muscles, which still retain some ability to respond to insulin, increase DG uptake during exercise, whereas such an increase is absent in denervated muscles completely unresponsive to insulin; and exercise does not improve or restore the ability of denervated muscles to respond to insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin (SRIF) is a neuropeptide which inhibits secretion from a variety of target cells including pancreatic beta-cells. In this study we have used the RINm5F rat insulinoma cell line to characterize high affinity receptors for SRIF. The binding of 0.03 nM [125I-Tyr11]SRIF to RINm5F cells reached a plateau level within 4 h at 37 C at which time 80% of the total binding could be displaced by 100 nM unlabeled SRIF. In contrast, 100 nM concentrations of eight structurally unrelated peptides did not inhibit [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding. Scatchard analysis indicated that RINm5F cells contained a single class of noninteracting binding sites (910 +/- 190 sites per cell) with high affinity for [125I-Tyr11]SRIF [equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.04 +/- 0.01 nM]. Competition experiments with SRIF analogs showed that the binding affinity for [I-Tyr11]SRIF (Kd = 0.03 +/- 0.02 nM) was higher than that for either SRIF (0.24 +/- 0.04 nM) or [Tyr11]SRIF (0.27 +/- 0.04 nM) and that reduced SRIF analogs bound poorly (Kd greater than 50 nM). These results demonstrate that RINm5F cells possess specific, high affinity binding sites for SRIF. Insulin release stimulated by 20 mM leucine or 15 mM glyceraldehyde was inhibited as much as 80% by maximal concentrations (100 nM) of SRIF. The IC50 for SRIF inhibition of leucine-stimulated insulin secretion was 0.43 +/- 0.15 nM, in good agreement with the apparent Kd for binding. In fact, this close correlation between binding affinity and potency to inhibit insulin release was observed for six SRIF analogs, indicating that the characterized binding sites are the receptors which mediate the biological actions of SRIF in RINm5F cells.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that obesity in sheep and cattle was associated with basal hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and an exaggerated insulin response to a single dose (350 mg/kg) of glucose. In this study, the glucose-dose dependency of insulin secretion in obese and lean sheep was determined by 1) using jugular venous concentrations of insulin (Exp 1) and 2) arteriovenous differences in insulin concentrations across the pancreas together with plasma flow rates in the portal vein (Exp 2). Sheep were injected with glucose doses of 0 (water), 10, 30, 100, and 350 mg glucose/kg body weight in Exp 1 (six sheep per group) and with a low (20 mg/kg) and high (200 mg/kg) dose of glucose in exp 2 (four sheep per group). In Exp 1, mean (+/- SE) pretreatment plasma concentrations of insulin (22.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.4 microU/ml) and glucose (56.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 52.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese than lean sheep fasted for 12 h. The glucose-induced rises in insulin concentrations above pretreatment levels were always greater (P less than 0.05) in obese than lean sheep regardless of glucose dose. Eadie-Scatchard plot analysis of the hyperbolic relationship between the acute insulin and acute glucose response areas (0 to +10 min) indicated that the maximum (Vmax) early phase insulin response was greater (P less than 0.025) in obese than lean sheep (568 +/- 148 vs. 156 +/- 33 microU ml-1 X min). In Exp 2, pretreatment concentrations of insulin (25.1 +/- 3.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.2 microU/ml) and glucose (58.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 45.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl) in arterial plasma were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese than in lean sheep fasted 18 to 22 h. Similarly, pretreatment pancreatic secretion rates of insulin were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese (17.8 +/- 5.8 mU/min) than in lean (4.9 +/- 1.3 mU/min) sheep. Glucose-induced acute (0 to +10 min) increments in pancreatic secretory rates of insulin also were greater (P less than 0.05) in obese than in lean sheep after the low (215 +/- 73 vs. 11 +/- 15 mU) and high (881 +/- 281 vs. 232 +/- 66 mU) doses of glucose. It was concluded that insulin secretion in response to a range of stimulatory concentrations of glucose was greater in obese than in lean sheep because the obese sheep had greater maximum (i.e. Vmax) acute phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion.\r"

NKA-immunoreactive fibers were observed around blood vessels and follicles in all species examined, whereas GAL-immunoreactive fibers were found in mice and rats only. NKA-containing fibers were more numerous than GAL-containing fibers. All thyroid NKA-containing fibers harbored substance P (SP), and the majority of them stored calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as well. Most thyroid GAL-immunoreactive fibers contained NKA, SP, and CGRP; in a minor population GAL coexisted instead with vasoactive intestinal peptide. Cervical vagotomy (extirpation of the nodose ganglion) reduced the number of NKA- and GAL-containing fibers in the thyroid by approximately 50%. The jugular ganglion and cervical dorsal root ganglia are fairly rich in GAL-, NKA/SP-, and CGRP-containing cell bodies, which presumably represent the source of GAL-, NKA/SP-, and CGRP-containing fibers in the thyroid. The thyroid ganglion is rich in vasoactive intestinal peptide nerve cell bodies, which presumably project to the thyroid gland; a minor proportion of these cell bodies was found to contain GAL as well. Although the distribution of NKA and GAL fibers in the thyroid suggests that the two peptides are involved in the regulation of local blood flow and follicular cell activity, neither NKA nor GAL had any influence on thyroid hormone release as tested in conscious mice.\r"

For the quantitation of this protein in the medium, a sensitive enzyme immunoassay was developed. The rat ventral prostate could be maintained in organ culture in defined medium for at least 2 weeks. Morphologically the changes in explants cultured without hormones resembled those of castration. These involutive changes could be postponed by testosterone and totally prevented by a combination of testosterone, corticosterone, and insulin in the culture medium. Newly synthesized prostatein, studied by fluorography of [35S] methionine-labeled proteins, accumulated only in the presence of testosterone. Its synthesis also took place in cultured prostate derived from castrated rats. Neither corticosterone nor insulin alone could sustain prostatein synthesis. Insulin increased the testosterone-dependent prostatein synthesis in the beginning of culture, but later, inhibition, rather than stimulation, could be noted. Corticosterone increased the testosterone-dependent synthesis of prostatein throughout the culture. The results show that organ culture of adult rat ventral prostate provides an in vitro model for studies of differentiated prostatic function.\r"

Insulin action (measured as the effect on incorporation of acetate-carbon into long-chain fatty acids) was unaffected by bGH in short term incubations regardless of whether hydrocortisone (HC) was present. After 48 h of culture, however, both pbGH and rbGH similarly antagonized the ability of insulin to maintain lipogenic capacity. This antagonism was dependent upon the presence of HC and was dose dependent, with half-maximal inhibition of insulin action occurring at about 0.5 ng/ml bGH. Bovine PRL did not mimic the effects of bGH on insulin action. These results establish that bGH antagonizes insulin action in bovine adipose tissue and that this effect is dependent upon long term exposure and the inclusion of HC in the culture medium. The fact that both rbGH and pbGH acted similarly indicates that this is an intrinsic property of bGH. The effect of bGH on insulin-dependent maintenance of lipogenic capacity may play an important role in redirecting nutrients away from adipose tissue to other tissues, such as muscle or mammary tissue. It is speculated that this metabolic effect of bGH plays an important role in the adaptive response to chronic bGH treatment, which increases milk yield of dairy cows and growth performance of beef cattle.\r"

  ".U": "87246444\r", 
  ".W": "The C-17 fatty acid esters of estradiol are a unique family of long-acting estrogens that circulate in blood. The unusual duration of the estrogenic action of these esters has been shown previously to correlate with their very slow rate of metabolism. However, in striking contrast to their slow rate of metabolism, the clearance of these esters from blood is relatively rapid, not very different from that of estradiol (E2). Studies on the effect of the size of the carboxylic acid moiety on the rates of both metabolism and clearance have suggested that an active process might be involved in the cellular uptake of these circulating esters, and this, in turn, raised the question of how E2-fatty acid esters are transported in blood. The binding of representative E2-17-fatty acid esters to both human and rat plasma proteins known to bind either E2 or fatty acids was investigated. As expected, both E2 and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone bound to human sex hormone-binding globulin, whereas none of the E2 esters bound to this human plasma protein. Similarly, E2 bound to rat alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unsaturated fatty acids bound to both human and rat AFP, but none of the E2 esters bound to AFP of either species. These steroid esters bind to lipoproteins. Over 85% of a representative ester, E2-17-stearate, partitioned in the lipoprotein fractions of both human and rat serum, while the synthetic short chain ester, E2-17 beta-acetate, like E2 itself, partitioned predominantly in the nonlipoprotein fraction of blood. These results demonstrate the unusual binding of a family of steroid hormones to plasma lipoproteins and open the possibility that they are transported into target cells through the mediation of lipoprotein receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) with porcine thyroid cells cultured in monolayer was studied. Specific binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I to thyroid cells was a reversible process dependent on the time and temperature of incubation. A steady state was achieved in 18 h at 4 C and averaged 14.2 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD)/10(6) cells. Binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I was inhibited by unlabeled IGF-I; half-maximal inhibition occurred at concentrations of 2-5 ng/ml. Multiplication-stimulating activity (rat IGF-II) and pork insulin had relative potencies of 1:20 and 1:300 compared with IGF-I. Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed a single class of IGF-I receptors with a Ka of 4.3 X 10(10) M-1, 49,000 binding sites were estimated per cell. Affinity cross-linking and autoradiography demonstrated the presence of type I IGF receptors. Thyroid cells also had specific receptors for insulin, but specific binding of [125I]iodoinsulin (2.03 +/- 0.03%/10(6) cells) was much lower than that of [125I]iodo-IGF-I. Preincubation of thyroid cells with IGF-I or insulin caused a concentration-dependent decrease in [125I]iodo-IGF-I binding due to an apparent loss of receptors. Preincubation with epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or TSH did not alter subsequent binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I. Low concentrations of IGF-I stimulated DNA synthesis and proliferation of thyroid cells and acted synergistically with epidermal growth factor. Multiplication-stimulating activity and insulin had relative potencies in stimulating DNA synthesis comparable to their abilities to inhibit the binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I to thyroid cells, suggesting that their effects are mediated primarily by IGF-I receptors. Preincubation with IGF-I did not alter cAMP responsiveness to TSH. We, thus, demonstrated the presence of functional and regulated IGF-I receptors on porcine thyroid cells.\r"

A component in thecal cell-conditioned medium was immunologically similar to TGF beta, as assessed with a RIA, and inhibited specific binding of TGF beta to its cell surface receptors. Thecal cell-secreted proteins also contained TGF beta biological activity, which was determined by stimulation of soft agar colony formation by AKR-2B indicator cells. Specific TGF beta antibodies precipitated a 25 K protein from radiolabeled thecal cell-secreted protein that comigrated with purified platelet-derived TGF beta. Both bovine thecal cell and rat thecal/interstitial cell preparations produced TGF beta, which required acid treatment to obtain fully active samples. The physiological significance of TGF beta production by thecal cells was addressed through an analysis of the effects of TGF beta on bovine granulosa cell growth. TGF beta inhibited epidermal growth factor stimulation of granulosa cell growth, but alone it had no apparent influence. Observations indicate that ovarian thecal cells produce TGF beta, which can regulate granulosa cell growth and differentiation. Discussion of thecal cell-granulosa cell interactions and the possible functions of TGF beta in the ovary is presented.\r"

After tissue sections of 4 micron were mounted, endogenous peroxidases were removed with hydrogen peroxide, and the sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature followed by 16 hours at 4 degrees C with a highly specific antisera for mouse EGF (mEGF), nonimmunized normal rabbit serum, or antiserum preadsorbed with excess antigen. After the reaction with the second antibody (goat antirabbit IgG) for 1 hour at room temperature, the peptide was localized by use of PAP and 3.3'-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. EGF could be localized in the luteal cells of five corpora lutea (day 17 to day 25) but not in a corpus luteum of day 22 and all ovarian stromal tissue examined. The localization of immunoreactive EGF in the human corpus luteum demonstrates directly for the first time the presence of this growth-promoting peptide in this tissue, which suggests its local production.\r"

We studied the effects of a protease derived from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, whose substrate specificity is limited to human IgA1, on the ability of antibody-bound sperm to penetrate human cervical mucus in vitro. IgA on the sperm surface, but not IgG, was degraded by IgA1 protease. A correlation was seen between the levels of IgA bound relative to IgG and the improvement in sperm cervical mucus penetrating ability after IgA1 protease exposure. These results provide evidence that antisperm autoantibodies of both IgA and IgG classes impair the ability of spermatozoa to populate the female reproductive tract. They implicate the Fc region of the immunoglobulin molecule in mediating this effect and offer the potential to restore male fertility by treating antibody-bound sperm in vitro with immunoglobulin-directed bacterial proteases, before insemination.\r"

Baseline sperm count was 17.092 +/- 3.09 (10(6)/ml). Hormonal profile was performed and included follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) stimulation tests. The sperm analysis and hormonal profile were repeated at 6 and 12 months of the study. A sperm penetration assay (SPA) was performed on zona-free hamster egg. Compared with the placebo group, the TAM group showed a significant increase in plasma FSH, LH, E2, and T levels (P less than 0.001), but not in PRL and TSH levels. However, LH-RH stimulation tests and SPA were found to be comparable in the two treatment groups, and there was no significant effect on sperm analysis. Tamoxifen appeared to be no more effective than the placebo in the treatment of idiopathic oligozoospermia.\r"

Treatment was commonly initiated in the hospital but was then continued outside, with patients and local physicians accepting responsibility for maintaining IV-GnRH delivery systems. Twenty-eight of 113 treatment cycles (24.8%) resulted in pregnancy, with four spontaneous abortions (14.3%) and four twin pregnancies (16.7%) among 24 births. Probability of pregnancy per treatment cycle was significantly higher for primary amenorrhea (0.30) and for HCA (0.33) than for PCOS (0.07; P less than 0.05) and for oligomenorrhea (no conceptions; P = 0.01). Ovulatory cycles were not achieved in five patients (primary amenorrhea, n = 1; PCOS, n = 3; oligomenorrhea, n = 1). There were no serious complications; six patients recorded eight febrile episodes, which responded quickly to antibiotic therapy and cannula change. The authors conclude that outpatient IV-GnRH is safe, practical, and effective for follicular stimulation and ovulation induction in women presumed to have GnRH deficiency and in whom clomiphene therapy fails, and that less intensive monitoring is needed compared with gonadotropin ovulation induction therapy.\r"

No pregnancies occurred. In 6 women with fairly regular bleedings, the endometrium displayed weak to normal proliferation. Twenty women developed oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, 16 of them had inactive endometrium, 1 had weakly proliferative endometrium, and 3 endometrial biopsies were too sparse for adequate evaluation. One woman reported repeated episodes of heavy uterine bleedings. The endometrial biopsy from this woman showed weak proliferation. No signs of endometrial hyperplasia were observed. Generally, the electron microscopy showed signs of low metabolic activity and weak protein synthesis. Thus, long-term continuous treatment with nafarelin acetate for inhibition of ovulation does not appear to have untoward effects on the endometrium.\r"

Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between fasting serum insulin concentration and both androstenedione (delta 4A) and testosterone (T) concentrations, which were independent of body mass index (kg/m2). A strong negative correlation was demonstrated between fasting insulin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels within the HA group (r = -0.84, P = 0.003). Significant positive correlations were also demonstrated between the cumulative sum insulin response during OGTT and the percent change from fasting baseline to 3 hours in serum delta 4A (r = 0.65, P = 0.006), T (r = 0.51, P = 0.033), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001).

To investigate whether a comparable situation prevails in mildly diabetic animals, streptozocin (22.5 mg/kg body wt) was administered to female rats at the onset of pregnancy. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, content and release of insulin in isolated islets, total mass and volume density of both the endocrine pancreas and granulated beta-cells, and ultrastructural prevalence of light and dark secretory granules were measured on the 20th day of pregnancy and in lactating and nonlactating animals 20 days after delivery. In the mildly diabetic animals, the changes in endocrine pancreatic function normally associated with pregnancy and lactation were greatly attenuated, albeit not completely eliminated. We propose that the increased biosynthetic and secretory activity imposed on surviving beta-cells after streptozocin administration tends to mask the adaptative changes in beta-cell function otherwise seen during the postpartum and lactation period.\r"

To examine this possibility directly, we measured glucose uptake after 24 h of hyperglycemia (281 +/- 16 mg/dl) and normoglycemia (99 +/- 6 mg/dl) in 10 type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients (age 33 +/- 3 yr, relative body wt 102 +/- 3%) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Hyperglycemia was induced by an intravenous glucose infusion, whereas saline was administered during the control day. During both studies the patient received a similar diet and insulin dose. After hyper- and normoglycemia, a primed continuous infusion of insulin (40 mU X m-2 X min-1) was started, and plasma glucose was adjusted to and maintained at 142 +/- 2 and 140 +/- 2 mg/dl, respectively, during 60-160 min of insulin infusion. The rate of glucose uptake after hyperglycemia averaged 8.3 +/- 1.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1, which was lower than the rate after the normoglycemic period (10.1 +/- 1.2 mg X kg-1 X min-1, P less than .001). In conclusion, short-term hyperglycemia reduces glucose uptake in type I diabetic patients. Thus, part of the glucose or insulin resistance in these patients may be caused by hyperglycemia per se.\r"

These relationships may be important in explaining the association of insulin resistance and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism found in obesity, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. We have measured plasma lipoprotein concentrations and indices of insulin action in 85 men and 56 women, all of whom were normolipidemic and had normal glucose tolerance. The subjects were obese Southwestern American Indians (body mass index 34 +/- 1). Insulin action was measured via the hyperinsulinemic clamp with simultaneous indirect calorimetry. Triglyceride concentrations were inversely related to rates of total insulin-mediated glucose disposal (in men and women, respectively, r = -.37, P less than .01; r = -.24, P less than .10), glucose storage (r = -.31, P less than .01; r = -.25, P less than .10), increase in glucose oxidation (r = -.29, P less than .01; r = -.24, P less than .10), and, in men only, suppression of endogenous glucose production (r = -.32, P less than .01).

This treatment depleted granules 85% below normal control values and rendered mapping of their positions and visualization of microtubules more feasible during electron microscopy. Islets were perifused with 2.8 or 16.7 mM glucose and were fixed at 4 min (acute phase) or 20 min (second phase). Photomicrographs of beta-cell sections were digitized, and computer replicas were compared to computer-simulated cells of similar size and shape into which an identical number of granules was inserted randomly. Margination of granules into a zone within 1.5 micron of the plasma membrane was examined. At both 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose, real cells marginated significantly more secretory granules than did simulated cell pairs. Within the zones of margination during 16.7 mM glucose perifusion, the number of secretory granules associated with microtubules was less than 6% in the acute phase and less than 1% in the second phase. These data suggest that glucose stimulation promotes movement of secretory granules into the beta-cell periphery to a greater extent than can be attributed to chance alone. The role of microtubules in peripheral granule movement into regions of exocytosis appears to be minimal.\r"

  ".W": "Tracer methodology has been applied extensively to the estimation of endogenous glucose production (Ra) during euglycemic glucose clamps. The accuracy of this approach has been questioned due to the observation of significantly negative estimates for Ra when insulin levels are high. We performed hyperinsulinemic (300 microU/ml)-euglycemic glucose clamps for 180 min in normal dogs and compared the standard approach, an unlabeled exogenous glucose infusate (cold GINF protocol, n = 12), to a new approach in which a tracer (D-[3-3H]glucose) was added to the exogenous glucose used for clamping (hot GINF protocol, n = 10). Plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations, and glucose infusion rates were similar for the two protocols. Plasma glucose specific activity was 20 +/- 1% of basal (at 120-180 min) in the cold GINF studies, and 44 +/- 3 to 187 +/- 5% of basal in the hot GINF studies. With the one-compartment, fixed pool volume model of Steele, Ra for the cold GINF studies was -2.4 +/- 0.7 mg X min-1 X kg-1 at 25 min and remained significantly negative until 110 min (P less than .05). For the hot GINF studies, Ra was never significantly less than zero (P greater than .05) and was greater than in the cold GINF studies at 20-90 min (P less than .05). There was substantially less between-(78%) and within- (40%) experiment variation for the hot GINF studies compared with the cold GINF studies. An alternate approach (regression method) to the application of the one-compartment model, which allows for a variable and estimable effective distribution volume, yielded Ra estimates that were suppressed 60-100% from basal. In conclusion, the one-compartment, fixed pool volume model of glucose kinetics is inadequate for the estimation of Ra during euglycemic glucose clamps. Two new strategies for estimating Ra from the one-compartment model, the hot GINF protocol and the regression method calculation, yielded more accurate and physiologically plausible estimates of Ra than currently used methodology.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of insulin in reversing the insulin resistance associated with depletion of the intracellular pool of glucose transporters, streptozocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with 5 U/day s.c. of insulin for 0, 8, or 14 days. At each time point, adipose cells were isolated, and 3-O-methylglucose transport was measured in the absence and presence of 1000 microU/ml insulin. With the cytochalasin B-binding assay, concentrations of glucose transporters in the plasma and the low-density microsomal membrane fractions were determined. Eight-day insulin therapy enhanced glucose transport rate (mean +/- SE) from 0.2 +/- 0.0 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 fmol X cell-1 X min-1 in the basal state and from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 5.5 +/- 0.4 fmol X cell-1 X min-1 in the insulin-stimulated state in untreated and treated diabetic rats, respectively; this is a 3-fold increment of glucose transport rate in both states compared with control rats. After 14-day insulin therapy, glucose-transport activity declined toward normal but still remained approximately 1.5- and 4-fold higher than control and diabetic rats, respectively. Despite the persistent enhancement of glucose transport rate, concentration of glucose transporters in the intracellular pool was restored only to its prediabetic state. Likewise, the increased concentration of glucose transporters in the plasma membranes after insulin stimulation was similar to that of control rats. Thus, we suggest that 8-14 days of insulin therapy reversed the insulin resistance in diabetic rat adipocytes by at least two mechanisms: restoration of the intracellular pool of glucose transporters and enhancement of glucose-transport activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we sought to determine the role of the endogenous sympathetic nervous system in glucose-potentiated insulin secretion in both NIDDM (n = 6) and normal (n = 6) subjects. Glucose-potentiated insulin secretion was calculated as the slope of the curve relating increasing ambient glucose levels to the acute insulin response to an intravenous pulse of 5 g of L-arginine. Glucose-potentiated insulin secretion was determined on separate days during alpha-, beta-, and combined alpha- plus beta-adrenergic blockade and compared with a saline control. In normal subjects, there was no effect of alpha-, beta-, or alpha- plus beta-blockade on the slope of glucose potentiation. In NIDDM, the initially decreased slope of glucose potentiation (0.25 +/- 0.06 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl, mean +/- SE; P less than .01) was not affected by beta-blockade but increased during alpha-blockade (0.91 +/- 0.22 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl; P less than .05). However, this improvement was abolished by combined alpha- plus beta-blockade (0.32 +/- 0.07 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl). Plasma norepinephrine was increased above basal levels in both normal (+260 +/- 89 pg/ml) and NIDDM (+438 +/- 162 pg/ml) subjects during alpha-blockade (P less than .05 for both). This increase in plasma norepinephrine strongly suggests that there is an increase in synaptic cleft norepinephrine concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, we found that the optimal insulin concentration required to obtain the glucose effect was greater than 10,000 microU/ml. To test the hypothesis that the requirement for high concentrations of insulin in the culture was due to rapid loss of insulin in hepatocyte cultures, serial measurements of insulin were made at different media insulin concentrations (0-500,000 microU/ml) and glucose concentrations (5.5 and 2.75 mM). In addition, a dose-response relationship was established between media insulin concentrations and the pattern of mRNAs present in the hepatocytes determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of in vitro translation products. We found that at low insulin concentrations (less than 1000 microU/ml), greater than 80% of the insulin was lost to the glassware, whereas at high initial insulin concentrations, approximately 23% of the insulin was lost to the glassware. Placement of media into the hepatocyte culture led to further insulin disappearance with a half-life for insulin of 41.5 h at 10,000 microU/ml and 13.8 h at 100 microU/ml. We found 16 mRNAs were altered by insulin at 5.5 mM glucose and 9 mRNAs were changed by insulin at 27.5 mM glucose. After taking into consideration the distributional and metabolic losses of insulin, all but one mRNA responded to insulin within the physiologic range of portal insulin (less than 1-94 microU/ml). Our data indicate that the hepatocyte culture is an excellent model to study the physiologic effects of insulin on hepatic gene expression.\r"

By light microscopy, there was no lymphocytic infiltration, but cytoplasmic vacuolization in the islets of Langerhans from the CsA-treated rats was seen. By electron microscopy, severe degranulation, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and dilation of endoplasmic reticulum were clearly seen in the pancreatic beta-cells. Islet cells isolated from the CsA-treated rats showed greater than 50% reduction in mRNA synthesis. A similar inhibitory pattern of mRNA synthesis was observed in in vitro CsA-treated (10 micrograms/ml) human pancreatic islet cells from one biopsy sample and in similarly treated rat insulinoma cells (RINm5F). The inhibitory effect of CsA on mRNA synthesis in RINm5F cells was dose dependent, with a 50%-inhibiting dose of 5 micrograms/ml. In addition to the inhibition of mRNA synthesis, CsA also inhibited protein and DNA syntheses, although the inhibitory effect on these macromolecular syntheses was significantly less than that on mRNA synthesis. However, there was only a minor effect of CsA on in vitro transcription and translation compared with that on RINm5F and islet cells. It is concluded that CsA-induced degranulation of the beta-cells in Wistar rats, accompanied by hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, may be due to indirect, reversible interference of the cellular function primarily involved in mRNA synthesis.\r"

The results demonstrate a dose-dependent suppression of prehepatic insulin production from 5.8 +/- 1.4 mU/min during the control study to 4.0 +/- 1.2 and 3.2 +/- 0.9 mU/min during plasma insulin levels of 34 +/- 4 and 61 +/- 6 microU/ml, respectively (P less than .05). Therefore, in contrast to recently reported results in vitro, insulin inhibits its own secretion in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of interleukin 1 (IL-1) on glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated rat islets of Langerhans have been examined. IL-1 both inhibits and stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion depending on the experimental design. Inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion was observed after a 15-h treatment of islets with either purified IL-1, murine recombinant IL-1 (rIL-1), or human rIL-1, rIL-1 inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion was dose dependent with half-maximal inhibition observed at 25 pM human rIL-1. Basal insulin secretion was not affected by rIL-1 treatment. Mannose- and leucine-induced insulin secretion was also inhibited by a 15-h treatment with human rIL-1. Islets treated 15 h with inhibitory concentrations of murine IL-1 were morphologically intact, well granulated, and retained normal concentrations of insulin compared with control islets. Furthermore, human rIL-1 treatment did not affect the islet plasma membrane permeability as assessed by the measurement of the islet intracellular volume. Finally, the viability of islets treated 15 h with murine rIL-1 was demonstrated by the observation that the inhibitory effects of murine rIL-1 on glucose-induced insulin secretion were reversible. In addition to the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on glucose-induced insulin secretion, purified IL-1 and human rIL-1 had stimulatory effects on glucose-induced insulin secretion under the following conditions: a 90-min incubation with purified IL-1 (10% vol/vol) or in the presence of human rIL-1 (1400 pM) or a 15-h incubation with relatively low concentrations of human rIL-1 (0.5 or 5 pM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-deficient diabetes in humans, as well as in the neonatal streptozocin-induced rat model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), are associated with islet beta-cell insensitivity to glucose. We hypothesized that the chronic hyperglycemia-hypoinsulinemia pattern causes this impairment of the glucose influence on insulin secretion. This study was designed to determine whether the glucose defect could be counteracted by normalizing the diabetic state in rats with NIDDM after insulin therapy. Mixte lente insulin (5 U X kg-1 X day-1) was given daily at 1700 h over 24 h or 5 consecutive days. Insulin secretion was studied the morning after the last insulin injection with the isolated perfused pancreas preparation. Fed basal plasma glucose levels decreased in diabetic rats from 183 +/- 8 to 136 +/- 10 mg/dl after the 1-day insulin treatment and to 135 +/- 5 mg/dl after the 5-day insulin treatment (vs. 116 +/- 3 mg/dl in control rats). Pancreatic insulin stores were not affected by insulin therapy. Although the 1-day insulin treatment did not modify the lack of glucose response in the diabetic rats, the 5-day insulin treatment improved their glucose-induced insulin secretion. Moreover, insulin therapy improved the priming effect of glucose on a second stimulation with glucose. The return of this glucose effect was hardly detectable after the 1-day insulin therapy but was clearly present after the 5-day treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A Delphi study, involving three questionnaires, was conducted to determine skills needed in the following areas: designing a research project, conducting a research project, statistical knowledge and/or skills, and computer skills. Participants were 32 family physicians who had published at least one article in the Journal of Family Practice (1983-84) or Family Medicine (1983-84). The Delphi technique was successful in achieving consensus among study participants. A total of 77 skills were identified in the four areas as being at least somewhat important to the beginning family medicine investigator. Thirty-eight of these skills were identified as important to extremely important.\r"
