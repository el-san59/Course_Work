  ".W": "Bioprosthetic valves fail frequently because of pathological mineralization, a process that begins in cell remnants of the glutaraldehyde (GLUT) fixed tissue. Other pathological cardiovascular calcification and physiological mineralization in skeletal/dental tissues are both largely initiated in cell-derived membranous structures (often called \"matrix vesicles\"), and the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) likely has an important function in the pathogenesis of mineral nucleation. This study tested the hypothesis that AP might also be present in and contribute to calcification of bioprosthetic valves. AP activity of fresh and GLUT-treated bovine pericardium was measured by the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol. Following 24 hours in 0.6% HEPES-buffered GLUT and storage for 2 weeks in 0.2% GLUT, considerable AP hydrolytic activity remained in GLUT-treated tissue relative to that of fresh tissue (Vmax, 24 vs. 45 mumol reaction product/min/mg tissue protein, respectively), although binding was somewhat reduced (Km, 1.9 X 10(3) vs. 1.4 X 10(3) microM substrate, respectively). Enzyme reaction product was demonstrated in both fixed and fresh tissue by light microscopic histochemical studies, confirming the biochemical results. Reaction product was noted along membranes of vascular endothelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts, the sites of early calcific deposits in bioprosthetic valves, by ultrastructural examination of GLUT-treated tissue. We conclude that GLUT-treated bovine pericardium retains much of the hydrolytic activity of AP, an enzyme associated with normal skeletal and pathological cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mineralization, and suggest that further examination of the mechanistic role of this enzyme may stimulate new approaches for slowing or preventing calcification of bioprosthetic tissue.\r"

Coronary recanalization rates determined angiographically after 45 minutes of intracoronary infusion averaged 90% in group H, 59% in group L, and 61% in group U. The differences were statistically significant between group H and the latter two groups. Pro-urokinase affected plasma proteins of the fibrinolytic system to a lesser degree than urokinase. Bleeding complications were present in one patient in group L, in none in group H, and in five in group U. Thus, intracoronary administration of 6,000 units pro-urokinase is more effective in coronary thrombolysis and causes less systemic fibrinogenolysis than intracoronary administration of urokinase.\r"

  ".U": "89003506\r", 
  ".W": "To determine 1) whether the effect of intravenous nitroglycerin (NG) therapy during acute myocardial infarction on creatine kinase infarct size is influenced by infarct location (anterior vs. inferior), timing (therapy less than 4 hours vs. greater than or equal to 4 hours after onset of pain), and dose response (mean blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg vs. less than 80 mm Hg during the first 12 hours) and 2) whether NG therapy modifies infarct expansion, 310 patients were randomly allocated to NG (n = 154) and control (n = 156) groups. NG infusion was titrated to lower mean blood pressure by 10% in normotensive and 30% in hypertensive patients, but not below 80 mm Hg, and was maintained for 39 hours. Measurements included clinical variables, creatine kinase infarct size (geq) as well as left ventricular (LV) asynergy, LV ejection fraction, expansion index, and thinning ratio on serial two-dimensional echocardiography. Compared with controls, creatine kinase infarct size was less in the NG group (41 vs. 55 geq, p less than 0.001), in anterior (44 vs. 58 geq, p less than 0.05), and inferior (39 vs. 53 geq, p less than 0.025) NG subgroups, and in early than late NG subgroups (43% vs. 22% decrease). Other indexes of infarct size also improved (p less than or equal to 0.05) with NG compared with controls. Thus, by 10 days, LV asynergy was 40% less, LV ejection fraction was 22% more, and Killip class score was 41% less. A negative effect of mean blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg with NG was reflected in these indexes. In addition, expansion index increased (p less than 0.001) by 31% and thinning ratio decreased (p less than 0.001) by 17% in controls by 10 days but remained unchanged with NG. Infarct-related major complications were less frequent in the NG than the control groups: infarct expansion syndrome (2% vs. 15%, p less than 0.0005), LV thrombus (5% vs. 22%, p less than 0.0005), cardiogenic shock (5% vs. 15%, p less than 0.005), and infarct extension (11% vs. 22%, p less than 0.025). Mortality was less in NG than in control groups in-hospital (14% vs. 26%, p less than 0.01), at 3 months (16% vs. 28%, p less than 0.025) and 12 months (21% vs. 31%, p less than 0.05), but this advantage was only found in the anterior subgroups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The distributions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in human hearts during the developmental stage and in adult pathological states was examined with an antibody specific to human alpha-ANP. With immunoblotting and immunofluorescence methods, we found that a 17-kDa protein, which is a pro ANP, was expressed in human fetal ventricles, in which the numbers of myofibers containing ANP granules were more abundant in the subendocardial region than the subepicardial region. As determined by radioimmunoassay, the content of immunoreactive ANP (per milligram protein) in the developing heart was greatest in the left atrium and occurred decreasingly in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle, respectively. Because ANP content in the left ventricle declined during the progress of gestation in developing hearts and because it was very low, if ever detectable, in normal adult hearts, ventricular ANP expression appears to be developmentally regulated from the early gestational stage. However, it was reexpressed in the ventricles of patients who had suffered from severe congestive heart failure. In this situation, we found that the ventricular ANP expression was more marked in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy than in patients with severe valvular disease. Interestingly, in the ventricles of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, ANP contents were higher in the left ventricular free wall than in the right ventricular free wall, although the left ventricular subendocardium contained more ANP than the subepicardium, showing a transmural gradient similar to that expressed in fetal ventricles. Thus, the expression of ANP in human ventricles is developmentally regulated from the early gestational stage, and even adult ventricular myofibers can synthesize ANP during severe congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The number of RBCs identified in the urine sediment is dependent, in part, upon the technique used in performing the urinalysis. The exact number of RBCs normally excreted into the urine has been difficult to establish. However, three to eight RBCs per HPF would be accepted by most investigators as an acceptable dividing point between normal and abnormal hematuria. Although the prevalence of microscopic hematuria in the general population is high, the number of patients who have serious urologic disease is low. Many diagnostic algorithms are available for evaluating these patients, but at the present time there is still uncertainty regarding how extensive the evaluation should be for patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.\r"

I argue that the responsible cause in such cases is typically the physician's decision to suspend food and/or water, made with the deliberate concurrence of the patients, families and/or courts. I also argue that with proper safeguards this is both a reasonable policy and one that should be interpreted as a general surrogate for rational, medically assisted suicide.\r"

The closest correlation was obtained with the rate of initial postischemic recirculation; CBF above 40 ml/100 g.min resulted almost consistently in EEG recovery. Temperature, arterial pH, plasma glucose, and osmolality also influenced recovery. There was no correlation of EEG recovery with blood gases nor improvement of recovery after incomplete ischemia or barbiturate anesthesia. The results are interpreted in respect to common concepts of ischemic injury and the treatment of postischemic resuscitation disease.\r"

Mediator compounds are considered to form or to become released in an area of primarily damaged brain (necrosis) and to enter the cerebral parenchyma through the broken blood-brain barrier from the intravascular space. Many biochemical factors must be considered. We suggested three criteria for determining the roles of mediators: a) they must inflict brain tissue damage, b) they must occur in pathologic concentrations or in compartments not normally present, and c) specific inhibition should attenuate secondary brain damage. These requirements are met by the kallikrein-kinin system and by glutamate. In the case of arachidonic acid and its many metabolites, the concept is difficult to test because fatty acids may be active only if not bound to proteins, and therapeutic inhibition might be difficult. A variety of mediators may enhance each other in a cascade manner by various initiating reactions that might be amenable for pharmacologic inhibition.\r"

Consequently, there was a striking increase in the venoarterial gradients for both [H+] and CO2. Both cardiac output (pulmonary blood flow) and the concentration of expired CO2 were simultaneously decreased. In great cardiac vein blood, even more profound respiratory acidosis with only minor decreases in bicarbonate and only moderate increases in lactate were observed. Intramyocardial pH was profoundly decreased. The severity of respiratory acidosis as a determinant of resuscitability and survival should be further investigated.\r"

As anesthesia resolved, the rate of APRV breaths was decreased until patients breathed only with CPAP. During PPV and APRV, pHa, PaO2/FIO2, and hemodynamic variables were similar. All patients were weaned from APRV without complication. Optimal ventilator design for patients with acute lung injury would provide CPAP as a primary intervention and secondarily would augment alveolar ventilation. The APRV supported oxygenation and ventilation in patients with mild acute lung injury, yet with much lower peak airway pressure than produced by PPV.\r"

Patients underwent standard polysomnography including all night measurements of transcutaneous CO2 (tcCO2) and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2).

Follow-up studies after three months of treatment showed normal sleep patterns, improvement in daytime ABGs, lung volumes, and respiratory muscle strength.

  ".W": "Previous work by our group had suggested that some pulmonary medicine diagnosis-related group (DRGs) did not adequately compensate for patients with multiple complications and comorbidities. Congress has recommended no major changes to pulmonary medicine DRGs along these lines. The purpose of this study was to analyze resource consumption in any of the seven noncomplicating conditions (CC), stratified pulmonary medicine DRGs using the new DRG prospective \"all payor system\" in effect at our hospital. Analysis of 858 pulmonary medicine patients by payor (Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and commercial insurance) in these non-CC stratified pulmonary medicine DRGs for a three-year period demonstrated that patients with more CCs per DRG for each payor generated higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, a greater percentage of procedures per patient, financial risk under DRG payment, more outliers, and a higher mortality, compared to patients in these same DRGs with fewer CCs. Both hospital length of stay and total cost per patient (adjusted for DRG weight index) increased with CCs. Financial risk per patient under DRGs also increased as CCs accumulated. These findings suggest that new prospective DRG \"all payor systems\" may be inequitable to certain groups of patients or types of hospitals vis-a-vis the non-CC stratified pulmonary medicine DRGs. Many pulmonary medicine DRGs should be stratified by the numbers and types of CCs to more equitably reimburse hospitals under DRG all-payor systems.\r"

Multivariate analysis was used to identify potentially alterable factors affecting postoperative length of stay for 320 consecutive colorectal cancer patients undergoing elective surgery during a three-year period. Prolonged postoperative stays were noted for patients over age 69. Significantly longer stays were seen for men than for women (13.9 vs. 11.9 days, P = .012). Operative procedure significantly influenced postoperative stay: left hemicolectomies, anterior resections with colostomy, abdominoperineal resections, and subtotal colectomies were associated with significantly longer stays than right, transverse, sigmoid, and anterior resections without colostomy (P less than .001). Complications increased the mean postoperative stay from 11.4 to 19.7 days (P less than .001) and stay increased progressively with the number of blood transfusions received from 11.1 days for no blood to 21.6 days for more than four units (P less than .001). Severity of disease, as reflected by Dukes' stage, tumor differentiation, and tumor size, was not related to postoperative stay. In the latter half of the study, postoperative stay declined, accompanied by a decline in the use of blood and a shift in the procedures performed for rectal carcinoma away from abdominoperineal resection toward anterior resection without colostomy. Diagnosis-related group (DRG) relative weights for procedure, age, and complications are at variance with these findings.\r"

  ".W": "Increased duodenogastric reflux has been recognized as a cause of gastric mucosa damage. The frequent finding of bile-stained gastric juice and a suggested higher frequency of lesions of the gastric mucosa in patients with Chagas' disease, which is characterized by a marked reduction of myenteric neurons, suggest that impairment of intrinsic innervation of the gut might be associated with increased duodenogastric reflux. Duodenogastric bile reflux was quantified after intravenous injection of 99mtechnetium-HIDA, in 18 patients with chronic Chagas' disease, 12 controls, and 7 patients with Billroth II gastrectomy. All but one of the chagasic patients were submitted to upper digestive tract endoscopy. High reflux values (greater than or equal to 10%) were detected both in chagasic patients and in the controls, but the values for both groups were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those obtained for Billroth II patients (median: 55.79%; range: 12.58-87.22%). Reflux values tended to be higher in the Chagas' disease group (median: 8.20%; range: 0.0-29.40%) than in the control group (median: 3.20%; range: 0.0-30.64%), with no statistical difference between the two groups (P greater than 0.10). Chronic gastritis was detected by endoscopy in 12 chagasic patients, benign gastric ulcer in 2 patients, and a pool of bile in the stomach in 11 patients. However, neither the occurrence of gastric lesions nor the finding of bile-stained gastric juice was associated with high reflux values after [99mTc]HIDA injection. This study suggests that lesions of the intramural nervous system of the gut in Chagas' disease do not appear to be associated with abnormally increased duodenogastric reflux.\r"

It inhibited both the unstimulated and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion at 10(-7)-10(-4) molar concentrations. Its effect was different from that of PGE1 and PGE2, which did not affect basal acid secretion (up to 3 x 10(-5) M), although they inhibited to the same extent as misoprostol the pentagastrin-induced acid secretion. When given by \"mucosal\" application, misoprostol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) behaved similar to the mast cell stabilizer, compound FPL 52694, but its maximum reduction response was only 50%. The above data suggest that misoprostol has additional antisecretory mechanisms of action not shared by the classical natural prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter double-blind study was conducted in 416 patients (306 male, 110 female) with active endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers who were randomly allocated to receive the prostaglandin E1 methyl ester analog (Misoprostol/Cytotec), either in a dose of 400 micrograms twice daily (206 patients) or 200 micrograms four times daily (210 patients). No significant difference in the healing rates between the two groups was observed at four or eight weeks. In patients treated twice daily, the ulcer healing rate at four weeks for the intent-to-treat cohort was 124/205 (60.5%) and for the evaluable cohort was 96/136 (69.1%). In patients treated four times daily, the healing rate was 124/207 (59.9%) for the intent-to-treat cohort and 96/148 (64.9%) for the evaluable cohort. Similarly, the healing rates achieved at eight weeks for the twice- and the four-times-daily dosages in the intent-to-treat cohort were 72.2% and 74.4%, respectively, and for the evaluable cohort were 88.0% and 86.6%, respectively. Significantly more patients receiving misoprostol twice daily were free of ulcer pain after four weeks of treatment than were those receiving misoprostol four times daily, namely, 71.4% as compared with 57.9%, respectively (P = 0.003) and for a median period of 21 as compared with 17 days (P = 0.002). Diarrhea was more common in patients receiving the drug twice daily, (15.5%) than in those treated four times daily (5%) (P = 0.001). Diarrhea, three or more stools daily, was often transient and self-limiting and only necessitated withdrawal from the trial in nine (4.4%) of those treated with misoprostol twice daily and in one patient (0.5%) of those treated four times daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immune (gamma) interferon is a substance produced by immunologically activated mononuclear cells. Besides its antiviral activity, interferon gamma has a crucial role in immunoregulation, by acting directly upon lymphocytes and monocytes, and interacting with other soluble mediators of the immune response. Studies of the interferons system in inflammatory bowel disease have been limited, and little information is available on the generation of interferon during immunological events occurring in the human gut. To investigate the capacity of intestinal mucosal mononuclear cells to produce interferon gamma, lamina proprial mononuclear cells, isolated from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and control patients, were incubated with interleukin 2 or phytohemagglutinin, and the amounts of interferon gamma present in the culture supernatants were measured by a virus cytopathic effect inhibition assay. Under identical stimulatory conditions, culture supernatants of cells derived from actively involved mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease specimens contained two- to fivefold less interferon gamma than those of cells from control tissue. However, the amount of interferon gamma present in supernatants of cells from uninvolved inflammatory bowel disease mucosa was similar to that found in control supernatants. These results indicate that, in patients with active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, mononuclear cells produce decreased amounts of interferon gamma in the intestinal mucosa. The exact significance of these findings is unclear, but because of the importance of interferon gamma in a variety of cell-mediated immune phenomena, its impaired availability might be relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".U": "89004450\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence indicating that interleukin 2 may be important in the regulation of intestinal immunity, as suggested by its capacity to induce nonspecific cytotoxic (lymphokine-activated killer) activity from human intestinal mucosal mononuclear cells. The present study was designed to further explore the phenotypic and functional changes induced by interleukin 2 on intestinal lymphocytes derived from inflammatory bowel disease and control tissues. Immunohistology of intestinal mucosa demonstrated few cells bearing the activation antigen recognized by anti-Tac (anti-interleukin 2 receptor) monoclonal antibody. However, when isolated lamina proprial mononuclear cells were exposed to interleukin 2 in culture, the number of Tac-positive cells increased dramatically, a phenomenon paralleled by the generation of lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. This cytotoxic function was critically dependent on the continuous availability of interleukin 2, but not on the expression of the Tac antigen, since Tac-negative cells were also cytotoxic. Depletion of natural killer cells, fractionation into T cell-enriched and -depleted cells before and after culturing with interleukin 2, and separation into Tac-positive and -negative cells after interleukin 2 activation failed to eliminate lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, suggesting that this phenomenon is mediated by phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous cell subsets. During the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells variable amounts of interferon-gamma were produced, but these did not correlate with the degree of cytotoxicity. No differences were observed between the response to interleukin 2 by inflammatory bowel disease and control cells. Therefore, in view of its capacity to induce significant phenotypic and functional changes in different subpopulations of intestinal mucosal mononuclear cells, interleukin 2 should be regarded as an important modulator of intestinal immune reactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Although Strongyloides stercoralis is a common parasite, little is known about its effect on intestinal function. Published clinical studies are difficult to evaluate and compare because of the inability to differentiate the effects of the parasite load from that of various other coexisting features such as bacterial overgrowth, multiparasitism, malnutrition, or tropical sprue. Using a rat model where these problems do not occur, we found that Strongyloides ratti did not inhibit intestinal function in the healthy rat. In fact, in normal rats S. ratti appeared to increase ileal sucrase activity. In contrast, in the methylprednisolone-treated rat, S. ratti produced a decrease in lactase and sucrase activity and an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. S. ratti had no effect on 3-O-methylglucose uptake or D-xylose absorption in either group. These results suggest that S. ratti has little effect on small bowel function in a healthy rat but can cause minor alterations in intestinal function in an immunosuppressed, methylprednisolone-treated, malnourished host. These results are also consistent with clinical observations seen with S. stercoralis in humans and with another nematode, Ascaris suus, in the pig model.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which inhibin decreases the responsiveness of the pituitary gonadotroph to GnRH in terms of secretion of gonadotropins is largely unknown. We studied the effect of pure 31K bovine inhibin on the specific binding of GnRH to rat anterior pituitary cells in culture using iodinated Buserelin as tracer. Results showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells from adult male rats with inhibin (0-30 U/ml) for 72 h decreased Buserelin binding in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of a maximally inhibiting dose of manner. In the presence of a maximally inhibiting dose of inhibin, Buserelin binding decreased progressively with time, reaching a minimum of 42% of the control value after 3 days. Exposure of pituitary cells for 3 days to the inhibin-related peptides transforming growth factor-beta (up to 400 pM) and Mullerian inhibitory substance (up to 100 nM) did not decrease binding of Buserelin, suggesting that the effect was specific to inhibin. Inhibin did not compete with iodinated Buserelin for GnRH-binding sites when they were added to the assay tube simultaneously. In addition, treatment with inhibin halved the number, but did not change the affinity, of GnRH-binding sites and had no effect on either cell number of cell viability. It is concluded that the reduction by inhibin of rat gonadotroph responsiveness to GnRH may be partly related to a decrease in the number of GnRH receptors on the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the diabetic state on the somatotroph's responsiveness to the secretagogues GRF and (Bu)2-cAMP and to the inhibitor somatostatin (SRIF) were evaluated in enzymatically dissociated rat adenohypophyseal cells in primary monolayer culture. Primary cultures were prepared from pituitary tissue of spontaneously diabetic BB/W rats 23-51 days after the onset of hyperglycemia and glycosuria and of age-matched diabetes-resistant control rats. Dose-related stimulation of GH release by GRF and (Bu)2cAMP did not differ significantly in the two preparations. There was no evidence of abnormal sensitivity to TRH in cultured somatotrophs of diabetic rats. Dose-related suppression of (Bu)2cAMP (0.5 mM)-stimulated GH release by 0.01-10 nM SRIF, on the other hand, was significantly affected by diabetes, as indicated by a parallel shift of the dose-response curve to the right and an increase in the IC50 value from 76 +/- 2 to 204 +/- 5 pM (mean +/- SEM; n = 3; P less than 0.001). Maximal suppression by 10 nM SRIF was identical in the two preparations. The degree to which the cultured cells' responsiveness to SRIF was reduced was unrelated to the duration and severity of the diabetic state. Hypothalamic SRIF content did not differ significantly between diabetic and diabetes-resistant rats (186 +/- 12 vs. 178 +/- 10 ng/mg protein). Nevertheless, the SRIF concentration may be elevated in hypophysealportal blood of diabetic rats; we, therefore, examined the effect of prolonged exposure of the cell cultures to SRIF or SMS 201-995 on the subsequent suppression of (Bu)2cAMP-stimulated GH release by SRIF. Addition of either SRIF (10 nM) or SMS 201-995 (5.5 nM) to the culture medium for 4 days significantly increased the IC50 values for SRIF to values similar to those obtained in cultured cells of diabetic rats. We conclude that the somatotrophs of diabetic rats are relatively resistant to SRIF. Since prolonged exposure to SRIF in vitro produced similar resistance, the desensitization in diabetic rats may be due to elevated concentrations of SRIF in hypophyseal-portal blood. This impaired responsiveness to SRIF may contribute to aberrant GH secretion in diabetes.\r"

Peroxidase and immunofluorescent staining revealed immunoreactive GH in 99% of rPCO cells and immunoreactive PRL in 72% of cells. Within individual cells, GH and PRL appear to be colocalized. The storage capacity for GH in rPCO cells represented 40% of the daily hormone production. In serum-free medium containing 5 nM cortisol, GH secretion was stimulated 10- and 25-fold by 50 pM and 50 nM T3, respectively. GRH (1 nM) stimulated GH secretion 8-fold in the absence of T3, although no effect was observed in the presence of 50 nM T3. Qualitatively similar changes occurred in GH mRNA responses to T3 and GRH. Other secretory proteins were detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of culture medium, several of which were present in concentrations similar to that of GH. Nine separate cell lines were cloned from rPCO cells by limiting dilution, all of which secreted GH and PRL. GH secretion varied 6-fold between clones, and the GH to PRL ratio varied more than 200-fold. These rPC cell lines provide a new model for studying the control of GH and PRL gene expression, including hormone synthesis, processing, and secretion. They may also be useful for identifying other pituitary secretory products and as a source for the production of protein hormones.\r"

To determine whether this response is mediated by direct effects on PVN neurons, we studied the effect of unilateral stereotaxic implants of L-T3 into the anterior hypothalamus on the concentration of pro-TRH mRNA and pro-TRH in the PVN of hypothyroid rats. Because hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function is also regulated by central catecholamines, we also determined the effect of unilateral ablation of ascending catecholaminergic fibers to one side of the PVN by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine or transection of ascending catecholaminergic pathways. T3-implanted hypothyroid animals showed a marked reduction in pro-TRH mRNA and immunoreactive pro-TRH in medial parvocellular neurons of the PVN on the same side as the implant, but not in contralateral PVN neurons or TRH-synthesizing neurons in other hypothalamic regions. In contrast, hypothyroid animals implanted with pellets of hormonally inactive 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine showed intense symmetric hybridization and immunoreaction product in both wings of the PVN. Despite marked unilateral reduction in the catecholamine innervation to the PVN, no reduction in pro-TRH mRNA or immunoreactive pro-TRH was observed in the PVN on the affected side compared to that on the unaffected side. These studies demonstrate that negative feedback regulation of thyroid hormone occurs directly on TRH neurons and is restricted only to those in the PVN tuberoinfundibular system.\r"

The assay is accurate, precise (intraassay coefficient of variation, 4.8%), sensitive (25 pM; 2.5 fmol/tube), and specific for inhibin. The synthetic reference standard pI alpha(1-30) produced a displacement curve that paralleled intact male ovine and bovine sera, crude bovine follicular fluid, and a partially purified porcine follicular fluid reference preparation (WHO/NIH 86/690). Bilateral castration of prepubertal and postpubertal ram lambs resulted in a rapid decrease in serum inhibin concentrations and a subsequent increase in serum FSH. Inhibin levels were high in prepubertal lambs (approximately 375 pM), but these levels were not sustained near the time of puberty (approximately 180 pM). Intensive sampling by jugular venipuncture after castration indicated a 50% drop in circulating inhibin levels within 2 h of testes removal with chronic castrate levels (approximately 75 pM) achieved by 6 h postcastration. A rapid fall in circulating levels of inhibin was also observed after unilateral castration, but these values stabilized within hours to levels intermediate (i.e. approximately 200 pM) to those of intact and bilateral castrate rams. Hemicastrates exhibited a more subtle rise in serum FSH after testis removal, with FSH and inhibin levels of prepubertal hemicastrates returning to mature intact ram values by 15 weeks of age. Serum inhibin levels remained low and FSH levels high at 14 days in unilateral castrate postpubertal rams. Inhibin immunoreactivity increased abruptly in castrate ewes and rams injected iv with 5 ml bovine follicular fluid. Serum inhibin reached 300 pM immediately after bovine follicular fluid injection, and castrate FSH levels decreased 30% to a nadir 8 h later. These physiological findings provide support for the validity and utility of this inhibin RIA and further suggest that the Sertoli cells (not the germ cells) are the likely source of the FSH release-inhibiting factor from the testis.\r"

  ".W": "To demonstrate the existence and help clarify the function of renin in the rat ovary, we have characterized rat ovarian renin and examined ovarian renin levels during different stages of the rat estrous cycle. We show that high concentrations of active renin are present in the rat ovary (2.9 ng angiotensin I/h/mg). Ovarian renin activity has a pH optimum of about 7.0 and is due to a glycosylated aspartyl protease with an apparent mol wt of 39,000. These properties of rat ovarian renin are identical to previously characterized rat kidney renin. In PMSG-treated immature and adult 5-day cycling rats, ovarian renin was increased about 2-fold at estrus. At all stages of the estrous cycle in the 5-day cycling rat, the ratio of active to inactive ovarian renin was about 3:1, whereas about 90% of the renin in plasma was inactive. In the hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-treated rat ovary, over 90% of active renin remained in the residual ovary after the granulosa cells had been expressed, suggesting a theca-interstitial localization for renin. These studies indicate that active renin exists in the rat ovary, that its levels are cyclically increased at estrus, and that this increase may be due to enhanced local production and activation of the renin precursor. These findings greatly strengthen the concept of a functional renin-angiotensin system in the rat ovary.\r"

  ".W": "The characterization of human (h) FSH with 181 monoclonal antibodies (MCA) allowed the elucidation of its antigenic topography. One- and two-site, limited as well as excess reagent type radioimmuno- and enzymoimmunoassays revealed three main categories of MCA molecular binding specificities; two thirds of all antibodies were directed against the alpha-subunit and one fourth toward the beta-chain, and less than one tenth recognized the conformationally (c) intact holohormone. With high frequency immunization schedules these specificities were shifted toward a higher proportion of beta-MCA. On the basis of intra- and interspecies cross-reaction studies as well as epitope contiguity analyses by sandwich assays, the three main categories could be further subdivided into nine epitopes: 1) five epitopes associated with the alpha-subunit, two of which were suprisingly shared by other species, and two being iodination sensitive, 2) two evolutionary conserved structures on the beta-subunit, adjacent to each other, and 3) two c-determinants, one of these present also on hTSH. The epitopes were arranged in three major antigenic domains, which seems to be a common homologous construction principle of the four human glycoprotein hormones: a central domain, consisting of three identically arranged alpha- and similarly located c-epitopes, is flanked by a single spatially distinct domain on each subunit. The establishment of an epitope map was followed by the construction of an immunoradiometric assay with a sensitivity of 0.25 ng hFSH/ml and an apparent cross-reactivity vs. hLH, hTSH, and hCG of less than 1%.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine how exposure to FSH affects subsequent responsiveness of adenylyl cyclase and progesterone production to FSH in immature porcine granulosa cells in vitro. Acute cAMP and progesterone responses to FSH and the postreceptor activators of cyclase, forskolin and cholera toxin, were determined after a 24-h preincubation with FSH. Pretreatment with FSH (1-1000 ng/ml) resulted in an increase in subsequent basal progesterone production which was dependent on preincubation FSH concentration. The cAMP response to FSH, on the other hand, was reduced after preincubation with FSH in a manner dependent on preincubation FSH concentration. Removal of FSH with acidified medium and subsequent incubation in FSH-free medium resulted in recovery of the cAMP response to FSH, indicating that attenuation of the response is reversible. Attenuation of the cAMP response to FSH does not appear to be due to 1) a loss of activity of the catalytic moiety of cyclase, since the response to forskolin and cholera toxin was not decreased by FSH; 2) a decrease in coupling of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein with the catalytic moiety of cyclase, since the response to cholera toxin was not reduced by FSH; 3) inhibitory signals, since preincubation with pertussis toxin did not affect the subsequent response to FSH; or 4) cAMP itself, since neither cholera toxin nor the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenyl-thio)cAMP affected the response to FSH. It appears, instead, that FSH regulates FSH responsiveness by regulating the interaction of the FSH receptor with stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine whether changes in FSH receptors correlated with FSH-induced attenuation of FSH-responsive adenylyl cyclase in immature porcine granulosa cells. Cells were incubated with FSH (1-1000 ng/ml) for up to 24 h, treated with acidified medium (pH 3.5) to remove FSH bound to cells, and incubated with [125I]iodo-porcine FSH to quantify FSH-binding sites. FSH increased binding of FSH in a time-, temperature-, and FSH concentration-dependent manner. FSH (200 ng/ml) increased binding approximately 4-fold within 16 h. Analysis of equilibrium saturation binding data indicated that the increase in binding sites reflected a 2.3-fold increase in receptor number and a 5.4-fold increase in apparent affinity. The increase in binding did not appear to be due to 1) a decrease in receptor turnover, since the basal rate of turnover appeared to be very slow; 2) an increase in receptor synthesis, since agents that inhibit protein synthesis and glycosylation did not block the increase in binding; or 3) an increase in intracellular receptors, since agents that inhibit cytoskeletal components had no effect. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP did not affect FSH binding. The increase in binding appeared to result from unmasking of cryptic FSH-binding sites, since FSH increased binding in cell-free membrane preparations to the same extent as in cells. Unmasking of cryptic sites was hormone specific, and the sites bound FSH specifically. Unmasking of sites was reversible in a time- and temperature-dependent manner after removal of bound FSH. The similarity between the FSH dose-response relationships for unmasking of FSH-binding sites and attenuation of FSH-responsive cAMP production suggests that the two processes are functionally linked.\r"

No 11-reductase accompanied the purification. Homogeneity of 11 beta-dehydrogenase was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid end-group analysis and immunoprecipitation. The terminal amino acid was methionine. Monomer mol wt was 34,000. The enzyme was found to be a glycoprotein. A sequence of 40 amino acid units was identified from the amino end. The amino-terminal region was found to be highly nonpolar. Unlike unpurified microsomal 11 beta-dehydrogenase, which showed curvilinear Eadie plots, homogeneous enzyme gave rectilinear plots. Michaelis constants were 1.83 +/- 0.06 microM for corticosterone and 17.3 +/- 2.24 microM for cortisol. First order rate constants were 10 times greater for corticosterone than cortisol, and maximum velocities were similar.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the temporal changes and dose responses of ovarian inhibin gene expression, circulating inhibin, and ovarian estradiol content in PMSG-primed immature female rats. The relative levels of ovarian inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit messenger RNA (mRNA), serum inhibin, and ovarian steroid content were measured after stimulation of immature female rats with 20 IU PMSG. Each of these variables rose in parallel and peaked at 48 h (relative ovarian inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA increased 3.8-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively, serum inhibin 269 U/ml, vs. control 31, P less than 0.01, ovarian estradiol content 114 pmol/pair of ovaries vs. controls 4.7 P less than 0.001), corresponding to the time of maximal follicular development in this animal model. Subsequently each fell to reach a nadir at 96 h. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that PMSG stimulation of inhibin secretion occurs by a mechanism involving inhibin gene transcription. The increase in ovarian inhibin and estradiol synthesis during folliculogenesis and their simultaneous decline before ovulation suggest that 1) the circulating levels of inhibin and estradiol reflect follicular maturation and 2) these two hormones are regulated via a common mechanism during follicular development in the rat.\r"

Incorporation of [32P]phosphate into cellular proteins was analyzed by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. dbAMP stimulated phosphorylation of a 17.6K protein, while angiotensin II did not stimulate it. ANF did not affect the protein phosphorylation, whether the cells were in the basal state or stimulated by dbcAMP or angiotensin II. On the other hand, ANF markedly inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone production, but only slightly inhibited dbcAMP-stimulated aldosterone. These results suggest that in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells phosphorylation of the 17.6K protein may have a relationship with the stimulatory effect of cAMP on aldosterone production; however, neither angiotensin II nor ANF affected the phosphorylation of this protein, and phosphorylation of the 17.6K protein is not an obligatory step in the regulation of aldosterone production.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamics of arachidonic acid (AA) liberation and PRL release were highly correlated in perifused rat anterior pituitary cells during stimulation by three different neuropeptides: TRH, angiotensin II (AII), and neurotensin (NT). After preincubation of these cells with 1 microCi [3H]AA, a 20-min perifusion with AII (100 nM), TRH (100 nM), or NT (1 microM) elicited a sharp initial increase in PRL release and [3H]AA efflux, which rapidly subsided (within 6 min) to less elevated levels of PRL release and AA liberation. The plateau responses were sustained throughout the remainder of the 20-min treatment period; after the cessation of neuropeptide perifusion, the responses rapidly returned to basal levels. AII and TRH elicited a greater initial stimulation of PRL release and AA liberation, whereas NT resulted in less pronounced initial responses and a greater plateau of sustained PRL release and AA liberation. Dopamine (DA; 500 nM) or calcium-depleted medium (containing 60 microM EGTA) evenly attenuated the stimulation of PRL release throughout exposure to the neuropeptides; however, the initial stimulation of AA efflux by AII and TRH was relatively resistant to inhibition by DA or calcium-depleted medium. In contrast, the stimulation of AA liberation by NT was abolished by DA or calcium-dependent medium. These results establish that the time course of AA liberation is complimentary to that of PRL release during stimulation by AII, TRH, and NT and support a possible role for AA liberation and metabolism as one of the mechanisms that participates in the regulation of PRL release. A lesser ability of NT to elicit functional and biochemical responses to intracellular calcium mobilization is postulated as an explanation for the observed differences among AII, TRH, and NT effects on PRL release and AA liberation.\r"

  ".W": "Animals with impaired immune function show numerous reproductive disorders. To determine whether immune factors might play a direct role in the regulation of ovarian function, we examined the effects of Concanavalin-A-stimulated lymphocyte supernates (CAS) on steroidogenesis by cultured rat granulosa cells. Granulosa cells from immature estrogen-primed rats were incubated for 48 h with increasing doses of CAS in the presence or absence of FSH. In the absence of FSH, CAS produced a dose-dependent increase in progestin (progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone) production to a maximum of 190-fold greater than untreated controls, but did not stimulate estrogen production. In the presence of FSH, the stimulatory effect of CAS on progestin production was additive with that of FSH. In contrast, CAS inhibited FSH-stimulated estrogen production in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum inhibition was greater than 90%. Addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine to CAS-containing cultures significantly enhanced the stimulatory effect of CAS on progesterone production, suggesting that this action may be exerted through a cAMP-mediated pathway. The stimulatory component of CAS was heat labile, acid stable, and required a trypsin-sensitive cell surface recognition site, whereas the inhibitory component was both heat and acid stable. Neither the stimulatory nor the inhibitory actions of CAS were mimicked by treating granulosa cells with supernates from Concanavalin-A-stimulated neonatal cardiac or hepatic cell cultures. Thus, the present studies demonstrate that secretory products of lymphocytes (collectively termed lymphokines) can affect steroidogenesis in cultured rat granulosa cells. These data imply that immune cell factors may play a significant role in the differentiation and maturation of granulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we demonstrated that PTH stimulates production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by intact chick calvaria. In the present series of experiments, two cell populations were isolated from chick calvaria by centrifugation on a 25%/55% Percoll gradient. Cells harvested from the upper band of the Percoll gradient (designated F-1) appeared large and spindle-shaped in culture. Cells harvested from the lower band of the Percoll gradient (designated F-2) were relatively small and polygonal-shaped. Both cell populations required fetal bovine serum (FBS) for attachment and proliferation. In the presence of FBS the cells formed multilayers, but they formed confluent monolayers in the presence of heat-inactivated FBS. The pattern of cAMP responses to different effectors and biochemical determinations for alkaline and acid phosphatase suggests that the F-2 fraction consists primarily of osteoblasts. No cells with osteoclastic patterns appeared in either fraction. Both cell types synthesized predominantly PGD2. PGE2 was also produced, however, in considerably smaller quantities. PG production in the presence of ionophore A23187 (1 microM) or arachidonate (10 microM) increased significantly when the F-1 and F-2 cells were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio. These results suggest that cell to cell or cell to matrix interactions normally present in intact bone influence PG synthesis.\r"

LH pulse frequency, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (PRL) did not change significantly. These results are consistent with the reported hormonal effects of wedge resection and suggest that the impairment of ovarian surface acts on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to decrease pituitary hypersensitivity and the key factor behind the resultant hormonal change lies not deep inside the ovarian stroma but in the superficial ovarian capsule.\r"

Cultures were performed without serum but with precursors of estrogens and progestins. In basal conditions, Buserelin, at 1 ng/ml, increased estradiol and progesterone (P) secretion, while at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml, no effect was observed. In the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or LH, Buserelin at 1 and 10 ng/ml did not modify the cell's steroidogenesis. However, at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, Buserelin decreased LH stimulation of P secretion. These results suggest that LH-RH agonists, at concentrations in the range of those obtained in clinical use, can modulate ovarian steroidogenesis by direct action.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of therapeutic concentrations of leuprolide acetate on human granulosa-lutein cell steroidogenesis, fertilization, and embryo growth rates in vitro. During leuprolide administration, mean serum concentrations of leuprolide were less than 50 ng/ml and were undetectable 48 hours after cessation of administration. There was no effect of leuprolide on progesterone (P) secretion by granulosa-lutein cells cultured in the presence or absence of human chorionic gonadotropin. The effect of leuprolide on embryo growth rates was evaluated with the mouse two-cell embryo culture model and a retrospective review of early embryo growth rates in humans receiving adjunctive leuprolide therapy. There was no measurable effect of leuprolide on early embryo growth in either species. These data indicate that (1) serum and follicular and peritoneal fluid concentrations are undetectable 2 days after discontinuation of leuprolide; (2) there is no measurable effect of leuprolide on human or murine embryo growth rates up to the 8 cell stage in vitro; and (3) there is no measurable effect of leuprolide on granulosa-lutein cell P accumulation.\r"

In three patients, the spouses were successful in achieving five pregnancies, three of which generated five healthy newborns, one ended in a first-trimester abortion, and one is ongoing. In one patient, anti-GnRH antibodies were detected, secondary to initial response. This was associated with deterioration of gonadotropin levels and diminution in testosterone to pretreatment levels. The cross-reactivity of the antibodies with five GnRH agonistic analogs was examined. Possible treatment with pulsatile GnRH analogs in such patients is discussed. In light of the relatively long period of treatment needed to achieve spermatogenesis and fertility in patients with hypogonadotropic azoospermia, monitoring the appearance of GnRH antibodies seems appropriate to assess whether therapy should be concluded. The superiority of intravenous pulsatile GnRH treatment to subcutaneous GnRH treatment or to human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment is discussed.\r"

We assessed its possible role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active ulcerative colitis and controls were incubated for 4 h in Tyrode's buffer in the presence or absence of 0.2 microM calcium ionophore (A23187) or 50 microliter of antihuman immunoglobulin E. Platelet-activating factor was determined in the tissue by aggregation assay after extraction with 80% ethanol and was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and its inactivation by phospholipases. Platelet-activating factor was not detected in normal mucosa. Only A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E stimulated its activity: mean +/- SE, 43.2 +/- 8.6 and 33.0 +/- 6.1 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. In active ulcerative colitis basal platelet-activating factor activity was 8.9 +/- 3.5 pg/10 mg wet wt. A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E induced significantly higher stimulation of platelet-activating factor synthesis when compared with their effects on normal mucosa: 200 +/- 28 and 70 +/- 8.3 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. The enhanced stimulation induced by A23187 was dose-dependently inhibited by salazopyrine, 5-amino-salicylic acid, and prednisolone, but not by sulfapyridine. It is thus suggested that platelet-activating factor may be involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response in ulcerative colitis and that its inhibition by steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrine may be an additional mechanism to explain their therapeutic effects.\r"

The age and sex distribution and indications for gastrostomy were similar in both groups. Thirty-day mortality in the surgical group was 12% and in the percutaneous group 7.5%. Complications requiring surgical treatment occurred in 8% and 1.5% of the surgical and percutaneous patients, respectively. Significant nonsurgical complications, such as bleeding, aspiration, and myocardial infarction, occurred in 11% of patients undergoing surgical gastroscopy and 3.0% of those with percutaneous gastrostomy. Minor complications, such as mild wound infection and pericatheter leakage, occurred in 14% of surgical patients and in 0.7% of percutaneous patients. Overall, there were significantly fewer complications with percutaneous gastrostomy than with surgical gastrostomy (p less than 0.01). We conclude that percutaneous, nonendoscopic gastrostomy is safer than surgical gastrostomy and hence the preferred method for long-term enteral feeding.\r"

Monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin stained most, and possibly all, of the neuroendocrine cells in both normal and neoplastic tissue. Monoclonal antibody against chromogranin A also stained a high proportion of normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine cells. Immunostaining with polyclonal antisecretogranin I and antisecretogranin II antibodies was detectable in almost all of the normal and neoplastic tissue sections that were analyzed, and it was confined to a smaller population of neuroendocrine cells than that observed for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. Consistent with the immunohistochemical observations, immunoblotting revealed the presence of all four antigens in various tumors. The data show that synaptophysin and chromogranin A, for which monoclonal antibodies are commercially available, may be used as diagnostic markers for human gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Our results also suggest that the development of monoclonal antibodies against human secretogranins I and II will provide additional tools for a refined diagnosis of such tumors.\r"

This study was undertaken to define whether prostaglandins mediate the ANF-induced redistribution of renal blood flow and if prostaglandins and renal blood flow redistribution contribute to the natriuretic actions of ANF. In anesthetized dogs, the intrarenal administration of indomethacin (10 micrograms/kg/min) or the intravenous administration of meclofenamate (5 mg/kg) completely prevented the sixfold and twofold increments in urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion, respectively; it also abolished the redistribution of renal blood flow to the deep cortex. However, ANF induced a similar natriuresis before (from 53 +/- 17 to 281 +/- 48 microEq/min) and after (from 45 +/- 13 to 273 +/- 60 microEq/min) the administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors. It is concluded that the ANF-induced redistribution of renal blood flow to the deep cortex is prostaglandin-mediated but that neither redistribution nor increased prostaglandin synthesis is an important mediator of ANF's natriuretic action.\r"

To rule out an effect on peripheral vessels or on the sinoauricular node (or on both), BAY k 8644 and PN 200-110 were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at doses that did not change blood pressure. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was calculated as the slope of the relationship between systolic arterial pressure and heart period. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity increased with time following the onset of anesthesia. In SHR, injection of BAY k 8644 (3 micrograms/kg i.c.v.) suppressed the time-dependent increase in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. The inhibitory effect of BAY k 8644 (3 micrograms/kg i.c.v.) on the time-dependent increase in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was suppressed by pretreatment with PN 200-110 (0.6 microgram/kg i.c.v.) but not with the solvent, indicating that the central effect of BAY k 8644 occurred at the level of specific dihydropyridine binding sites.

Calcium, however, was not significantly different between the two groups, even though at this age blood pressure was higher in SHR than in WKY.

  ".W": "Specific atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) analogues have been found to have inhibitory activity in vitro in a calmodulin-dependent, human red blood cell membrane Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) model. Studied at 10(-8) to 10(-6) M concentrations, atriopeptin I (residues 127-147 of rat prepro-ANF sequence) and atriopeptin III (residues 127-150) progressively inhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity by up to 20% (p less than 0.001). This degree of inhibition was consistent with activities of other (calmodulin-independent) enzyme inhibitors in this model. Therefore, the C-terminal Phe-Arg-Tyr sequence (residues 148-150) is unnecessary for atriopeptin action on Ca2+-ATPase. Human and rat atrial peptides with amino acids 123-150 were inactive, indicating that the 123-126 sequence (Ser-Leu-Arg-Arg) must be cleaved to activate atriopeptins in this system. Human ANF fragment 129-150 also had no effect on Ca2+-ATPase, defining the importance of residues 127-128 (Ser-Ser) proximal to the disulfide bridge (joining 129 to 145). The addition of purified calmodulin to red blood cell membranes in the presence of inhibitory ANF did not restore Ca2+-ATPase activity to normal levels, indicating that the ANF effect on this enzyme is calmodulin-independent. Atriopeptin I and atriopeptin III had no effect on red blood cell Na+, K+-ATPase activity in vitro. Thus, the structure-activity relationships of ANF analogues in this novel human cell membrane model are highly specific. Although the inhibitory action of ANF analogues on Ca2+-ATPase, a calcium pump-associated enzyme, may be unique to the red blood cell, the calcium dependence of the gluconeogenic effects of ANF in the kidney would be supported by inhibition of this ATPase.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the question of whether escape from the sodium-retaining effect of mineralocorticoid involves an increased natriuretic effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Seven healthy volunteers taking a 170 mmol Na/100 mmol K diet received an intravenous bolus (25 micrograms) followed by a 1-hour infusion (0.02 micrograms/kg/min) of ANF (human ANF-[99-126]) before and after 10 days of 9-fludrocortisone acetate, 0.5 mg b.i.d. Escape was accompanied by an increase in body weight (from 72.2 +/- 12.9 to 74.0 +/- 12.6 kg; p less than 0.05), mean arterial pressure (from 95 +/- 4 to 109 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), plasma ANF (from 9 +/- 2 to 24 +/- 4 pmol/L; p less than 0.01), and inulin clearance (from 124 +/- 9 to 137 +/- 7 ml/min; p less than 0.05). Indexes for renal sodium handling (lithium and free water clearance) were compatible with a decreased \"proximal\" and an increased \"distal\" tubular reabsorption fraction. ANF infusion raised inulin clearance comparably before and after escape to 138 +/- 10 and 152 +/- 7 ml/min, respectively, but the natriuretic effect was much larger (p less than 0.05) after escape (from 366 +/- 34 to 1294 +/- 278 mumol/min) than before (from 248 +/- 48 to 630 +/- 124 mumol/min). Indexes for tubular reabsorption were consistent with greater suppression of both \"proximal\" and \"distal\" tubular sodium reabsorption by ANF after versus before mineralocorticoid expansion. These results indicate that escape is accompanied not only by a rise in plasma ANF but also by potentiation of the natriuretic effect of ANF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the last 45 minutes of infusion, angiotensin II, 6 ng/kg/min, was infused. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma concentrations of ANF, aldosterone, and cortisol, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured before and during infusion. Steady state mean plasma ANF levels during infusion were 26.2 (placebo), 68.8 (0.1 micrograms ANF/min), 221 (0.3 micrograms ANF/min), and 648 pg/ml (1.0 microgram ANF/min). Systolic blood pressure fell significantly (with 1.0 microgram ANF/min), and diastolic pressure tended to rise in a dose-dependent manner, while heart rate was unchanged. PRA and plasma aldosterone fell during ANF infusion in a dose-dependent manner (significant with 0.3 and 1.0 microgram ANF/min infused). The blood pressure-raising and aldosterone-stimulating effects of angiotensin II were blunted by ANF (significant only with 1.0 microgram ANF/min). It is concluded that effects of ANF on blood pressure and the renin-aldosterone system occur with plasma ANF levels close to the physiological range, as well as with slightly elevated ANF levels, as observed in congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency.\r"

PMN cytoplasts are nucleus- and granule-free vesicles of cytoplasm capable of releasing toxic O2 radicals but incapable of releasing granule enzymes. PMN cytoplasts when activated by PMA reduced 66 +/- 12.7 nmol of cytochrome c compared with 2.6 +/- 0.7 nmol in their resting state and did not release a significant quantity of granule enzymes (P greater than 0.05). Injection of PMA into New Zealand White rabbits caused a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the number of circulating cytoplasts. Increases in lung weight-to-body weight ratios in PMA-treated rabbits (9.8 +/- 0.5 X 10(-3] compared with saline-treated rabbits (5.3 +/- 0.2 X 10(-3] were also noted. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in lung lavage as well as the change in alveolar-arterial O2 ratio correlated with the numbers of cytoplasts in lung lavage (P = 0.001, r = 0.84 and P = 0.0166, r = 0.73, respectively). Albumin in lung lavage increased to 1,700 +/- 186 mg/ml in PMA-treated rabbits from 60 +/- 30 mg/ml in saline-treated rabbits. These changes were attenuated by pretreatment of rabbits with dimethylthiourea (DMTU). In vitro, cytoplasts were able to mediate increases in endothelial monolayer permeability. This was evidenced by increases in fractional transit of albumin across endothelial monolayers when treated with PMA-activated cytoplasts (0.08 +/- 0.01 to 0.28 +/- 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximal Pm was measured at rest and then during a 10-min endurance trial in which subjects repeated maximal voluntary inspirations with constant flow and breathing pattern. The endurance Pm data were fit to nonlinear exponential regression. The results indicated that 1) maximal Pm at rest was unaffected by changing ETCO2; 2) the rate of Pm decay over time was accelerated by hypercapnia, whereas hypocapnia showed no consistent effects; and 3) \"sustainable\" Pm, attained toward the end of the endurance trial, was not decreased; therefore sustainable force output was preserved in response to changing ETCO2.\r"

During inhalation of 0.5% CO in 40% O2, arterial O2 content (CaO2) was reduced to 40% and minute phrenic activity to 38.4 +/- 9.4% (SE; n = 9) of prehypoxic levels, primarily due to depression of peak phrenic amplitude (PP). CO2 response, defined as the slope of the plot of PP vs. end-tidal PCO2 during CO2 rebreathing, was unaffected by phrenic depression even to the point of total suppression of phrenic activity in two cats. The effect of the tissue metabolic acidosis associated with hypoxia on phrenic CO2 sensitivity was assessed in a separate group of cats by blocking lactate formation during hypoxia with dichloroacetate (DCA). Preventing lactic acidosis during hypoxia did not affect the CO2 response of the phrenic activity during hypoxia. We conclude that 1) hypoxic depression does not limit the ability of central respiratory neurons to respond to CO2, and 2) the failure of DCA to affect the CO2 response of the phrenic neurogram suggests that brain intracellular lactic acidosis does not modify the phrenic response to hypercapnia.\r"

ETV was determined by the thermal dye technique by use of a monoexponential extrapolation to exclude recirculating indicator, and regional blood flow was determined by a particle distribution technique (radiolabeled plastic microspheres). The lungs were weighted after the animals were killed, and extravascular lung mass (ELM) was determined with the use of hemoglobin to correct for trapped lung blood. Measurements were obtained before instillation of HCl into the right lung and repeated 3 h later before, during, and after PEEP ventilation or NTG infusion. Fractional perfusion of the severely injured portion of the right lung (Qinj/QT) fell from 44.3 +/- 11.1% at base line to 27.8 +/- 15.4% after the onset of lung injury. PEEP produced an acute reversible increase in ETV (63 +/- 37% over average of pre- and post-PEEP values), and the changes in ETV were closely correlated with changes in Qinj/QT (r = 0.91). NTG infusion produced insignificant increases in ETV (14 +/- 10% over average of pre- and postinfusion values) and Qinj/QT (59 +/- 35%), but the changes in ETV and Qinj/QT were strongly correlated (r = 0.92).

CBF measured by the tracer microsphere technique was decreased by 12% from 69 +/- 6 to 61 +/- 4 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (P less than 0.05). Infusion of 0.6 N NaCl as a hypertonic control had no effect on CBF. Cerebral metabolic rate for O2 and O2 extraction was not significantly changed from control (3.83 +/- 0.20 ml.min-1.100 g-1 and 5.7 +/- 0.6 ml/100 ml, respectively) during acid infusion. Cerebral venous PO2 was increased from 41.6 +/- 2.1 to 53.8 +/- 4.0 Torr by HCl infusion (P less than 0.02) associated with a shift in O2-hemoglobin affinity of blood in vivo from 38 +/- 2 to 50 +/- 1 Torr.

These data suggest that there is a functional blood-brain barrier in newborn piglets, that is relatively impermeable to HCO3- or H+ and maintains cerebral perivascular pH constant in the face of acute severe arterial acidosis.

Previous methods using extracorporeal circuits to unload CO2 are technically difficult and provide a limited number of experimental states per experiment. Using the method of high-frequency ventilation to unload CO2, we were able to obtain a large number of determinations in the same subject under conditions of hypoxia, normoxia, and hyperoxia. Data collected in five awake dogs show that the ventilatory response to CO2 is linear down to apnea during normoxic conditions but exhibits nonlinear behavior dependent on the level of arterial O2 tension. During hyperoxic conditions, the response was concave curvilinear, with a statistically significant decrease in slope near apnea. In contrast, mild hypoxia led to a convex curvilinear response with an increased slope near apnea.\r"

We examined the effect of CO2 inhalation and sciatic nerve stimulation as well as the application of nicotine (6 X 10(-4) mol/l) or lidocaine (2% solution) to the intermediate area of the ventral medullary surface (VMS). CO2 and VMS nicotine resulted in a significant increase in tracheal pressure [147 +/- 73 and 91 +/- 86% (SD), respectively]; and a significant reduction in nasal pressure (-35 +/- 10 and -20 +/- 13%, respectively). In contrast, sciatic nerve stimulation resulted in a significant fall in both tracheal (-50 +/- 36%) and nasal pressure (-21 +/- 13%). Application of 2 or 4% lidocaine to the VMS reduced tracheal pressure but did not significantly affect nasal pressure. After VMS lidocaine, nasal and tracheal responses to CO2, sciatic nerve stimulation, or VMS nicotine, when present, were negligible. These results suggest a role for the VMS in the regulation and coordination of nasal and tracheal caliber responses.\r"

Four intact and two carotid body-denervated goats underwent cisternal perfusion with mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of markedly varying [HCO-3] (CSF [H+] = 21-95 neq/l; pH 7.68-7.02) until a new steady state of alveolar hypo- or hyperventilation was reached [arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) = 31-54 Torr]. Perfusion continued as the goats completed two levels of steady-state treadmill walking [2 to 4-fold increase in CO2 production (VCO2)]. With normal acid-base status in CSF, goats usually hyperventilated slightly from rest through exercise (-3 Torr PaCO2, rest to VCO2 = 1.1 l/min). Changing CSF perfusate [H+] changed the level of resting PaCO2 (+6 and -4 Torr), but with few exceptions, the regulation of PaCO2 during exercise (delta PaCO2/delta VCO2) remained similar regardless of the new ventilatory steady state imposed by changing CSF [H+]. Thus the gain (slope) of the ventilatory response to exercise (ratio of change in alveolar ventilation to change in VCO2) must have increased approximately 15% with decreased resting PaCO2 (acidic CSF) and decreased approximately 9% with increased resting PaCO2 (alkaline CSF). A similar effect of CSF [H+] on resting PaCO2 and on delta PaCO2/VCO2 during exercise also occurred in two carotid body-denervated goats. Our results show that alteration of the gain of the ventilatory response to exercise occurs on acute alterations in resting PaCO2 set point (via changing CSF [H+]) and that the primary stimuli to exercise hyperpnea can operate independently of central or peripheral chemoreception.\r"

Gas is drawn from the tracheal tube, analyzed by a mass spectrometer, and presented as concentration vs. time waveforms simultaneously for CO2, halothane, and other respiratory gases and anesthetics. By use of a respiratory simulation device, the accuracy of mass spectrometric end-tidal CO2 analysis was compared with both the actual gas composition and infrared spectrophotometry. The effects of various ventilator rates and inspiration-to-expiration ratios on sampling accuracy were also examined. The technique was validated in male Sprague-Dawley rats being ventilated mechanically. The difference between the arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and the end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) was not significantly different from zero, and the correlation between PETCO2 and PaCO2 was strong (r = 0.97, P less than 0.0001). Continuous gas sampling for periods up to 5 min did not affect PaCO2, PETCO2, or airway pressures. By use of this new method for measuring end-tidal halothane concentrations in rats approximately 6.5 mo of age, the minimum alveolar concentration of halothane that prevented reflex movement in response to tail clamping was 0.97 +/- 0.04% atmospheric (n = 14). This mass spectrometric technique can be used in small laboratory animals, such as rats, weighing as little as 250 g. Gas monitoring did not distort either PETCO2 or PaCO2. Under the defined conditions of this study, accurate and simultaneous measurements of phasic respiratory concentrations of anesthetic and respiratory gases can be achieved.\r"

Two series of experiments were performed. In series I, two groups were studied that consisted of rats that had received myocardial infarctions produced by coronary arterial ligations and rats that had received sham operations. In this series of experiments O2 uptake (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were measured at rest, during four levels of submaximal exercise, and during maximal treadmill exercise in the same group of rats by use of both techniques in random order. VO2, VCO2, and the calculated respiratory exchange ratio (R) were similar at rest, during the highest level of submaximal exercise (20% grade, 37 m/min), and during maximal exercise; however, VO2 and VCO2 were significantly lower with the metabolic box technique compared with the mask technique during the three lowest work loads (5% grade, 19 m/min; 10% grade, 24 m/min; and 15% grade, 31 m/min). These differences appeared to be associated with a change in gait produced when the mask was worn. In series II, the arterial blood gas and acid-base responses to both submaximal and maximal exercise were measured using both techniques in a group of instrumented rats that had a catheter placed into the right carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the concept that biases in the usage of T cell antigen receptor beta variable (V) regions may be manifested in T lymphocytes that accumulate in nonmalignant, T cell-mediated human disorders, a V beta 8-specific antibody (anti-Ti3A, 5REX9H5) was used to evaluate lung and blood T cells in pulmonary sarcoidosis, a chronic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. Whereas normal patients had less than 5% Ti3A+ lung (n = 7) and/or blood (n = 9) lymphocytes, strikingly, a subgroup (8 of 21) with active pulmonary sarcoidosis had greater than 7% Ti3A+ lung and/or blood T cells and a higher proportion of Ti3A+ lymphocytes in the lung compared with blood. Dual-color flow cytometry demonstrated compartmentalization of Ti3A+ CD4+ lymphocytes to lung and Ti3A+ CD8+ lymphocytes to blood. Analysis with a 32P-labeled V beta 8 probe revealed that sarcoid lung T lymphocytes contained higher amounts of V beta 8+ mRNA than autologous blood T cells. However, Southern analysis of sarcoid lung and blood T cell DNA demonstrated no evidence of clonal rearrangements of V beta 8 genes. These observations demonstrate a clear bias toward the use of at least one V beta region in sarcoidosis, and suggests T cells accumulate secondary to external selective pressure, rather than in a random polyclonal fashion or by clonal expansion of one or few T cell clones.\r"

  ".U": "89008875\r", 
  ".W": "Activated protein C (APC) acts as a potent anticoagulant enzyme by inactivating Factor V and Factor VIII. In this study, protein S was shown to increase the inactivation of purified Factor VIII by APC ninefold. The reaction rate was saturated with respect to the concentration of protein S when protein S was present in a 10-fold molar excess over APC. The heavy chain of Factor VIII was cleaved by APC and protein S did not alter the degradation pattern. Factor VIII circulates in a complex with the adhesive protein von Willebrand factor. When purified Factor VIII was recombined with von Willebrand factor, the inactivation of Factor VIII by APC proceeded at a 10-20-fold slower rate as compared with Factor VIII in the absence of von Willebrand factor. Protein S had no effect on the inactivation of the Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex by APC. After treatment of this complex with thrombin, however, the actions of APC and protein S towards Factor VIII were completely restored. In hemophilia A plasma, purified Factor VIII associated with endogenous von Willebrand factor, resulting in a complete protection against APC (4 nM). By mixing hemophilic plasma with plasma from a patient with severe von Willebrand's disease, we could vary the amount of von Willebrand factor. 1 U of von Willebrand factor was needed to provide protection of 1 U Factor VIII. Also in plasma from patients with the IIA-type variant of von Willebrand's disease, Factor VIII was protected. In von Willebrand's disease plasma, which was depleted of protein S, APC did not inactivate Factor VIII. These results indicate that protein S serves as a cofactor in the inactivation of Factor VIII and Factor VIIIa by APC and that von Willebrand factor can regulate the action of these two anticoagulant proteins.\r"

  ".W": "A genomic clone was isolated from a human lymphoid cell line which synthesized an NH2-terminally deleted gamma 3 heavy chain disease protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a normal sequence from 310 bp 5' to the initiator ATG through the codon for VH amino acid 14. Amino acid 15 was derived from the codon for the last J4 amino acid. Thus, the clone contained a deletion of the codons for the VH region beyond amino acid 14, as well as those for the entire D region and most of the J coding region. Some sequence abnormalities were observed in the 400 bp after the deletion. Beyond this, there was excellent homology to published J and intervening sequences, including those containing the enhancer elements. The 1,200-bp switch region was abruptly interrupted by a sequence corresponding to the 3' one-third of CH1. Thus, a second deletion eliminated the acceptor splice site at the 5' end of CH1. When splicing of the primary RNA transcript occurred, the truncated VH region was joined via the J4 donor splice site to the next available acceptor site 5' to the first hinge exon. Hence, the aberrant serum protein was the product of two deletions and a splice correction as well as postsynthetic NH2-terminal proteolysis.\r"

Dexamethasone (Dex) increased cytoplasmic ANP mRNA levels and media ANP immunoreactivity in a dose-dependent fashion. These effects were not shared by the other classes of steroid hormones and were reversed by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486. The effect on ANP mRNA levels resulted, at least in part, from enhanced transcription of the gene. Dex effected a two-fold increase in ANP gene activity assessed using a run-on transcription assay. The turnover of the ANP transcript was approximated using a standard pulse-chase technique. The half-life of the ANP mRNA was 18 h in hormone-free media. In the presence of Dex this half-life increased modestly to 30 h, although the increase relative to the control did not reach statistical significance. The effect of Dex at the level of the individual myocardial cell was assessed by in situ hybridization analysis using a specific [3H]cRNA probe. These studies demonstrated a significant level of ANP expression within a subpopulation of cells in the cultures. Exposure of the cells to Dex for 24 h did not recruit additional cells into the expressing pool (27.3% cells/high power field vs. 31.3% for the control) but did increase the level of expression (i.e., grain density) within individual cells. These findings indicate that glucocorticoids stimulate expression of the ANP gene directly at the level of the myocardial cell. This results predominantly from transcriptional activation in cells already expressing the gene rather than through recruitment of previously quiescent cells.\r"

Specific kappa- or lambda-adsorbed fractions were also eluted from immunoabsorbents using chaotrophic thiocyanate buffers and equilibrated with pH 7.4 low salt buffer by dialysis. Immunoabsorption and elution experiments showed that five Graves' sera contained predominant cAMP-releasing activity within lambda Ig fractions, whereas two Graves' sera showed predominant cAMP-releasing activity in kappa Ig fractions. Four sera showed cAMP release approximately equally divided between kappa and lambda Ig both after immunoabsorption and specific anti-kappa or anti-lambda eluates were studied. C lambda genotypes were examined by Southern blotting and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of Eco RI-digested genomic DNA from 158 patients with Graves' disease in parallel with 112 normal controls and 29 patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism.

Fever, tachycardia, and at higher doses, hypotension occurred after a single injection of rTNF. Metabolic effects after rTNF administration were dose related and included enhanced energy expenditure with elevated CO2 production, increased whole body protein metabolism and peripheral amino acid efflux from the forearm, and decreased total arterial amino acid levels associated with a significant increase in plasma cortisol. Elevated serum triglycerides, as well as increased glycerol and free fatty acid turnover were seen, suggesting increased whole body lipolysis and fat utilization after rTNF. These findings indicate that administration of TNF in man reproduces many of the acute physiologic and metabolic responses to tissue injury, including energy substrate mobilization.\r"

This study was initiated to characterize the effects of synthetic inhibitors of phospholipase activities using a cultured myocardial cell model in which arachidonic acid is liberated after treatment with the metabolic inhibitor, iodoacetate. Pretreatment with a steroidal diamine (U26,384) blocked the degradation of labeled phosphatidylcholine and the release of arachidonic acid in cultured myocardial cells during ATP depletion. Inhibition of phospholipid degradation by U26,384 prevented the development of sarcolemmal membrane defects and the release of creatine kinase from the cultured myocardial cells during ATP depletion. Pretreatment with U26,384 had no significant effect on the extent of ATP depletion after iodoacetate treatment, which indicates that the activity of this compound could not be simply ascribed to a sparing effect on ATP concentration. These results support the hypothesis that the development of sarcolemmal membrane injury and the associated loss of cell viability are causally related to progressive phospholipid degradation. In addition, these studies indicate that the release of arachidonic acid during ATP depletion is associated with the net loss of the phosphatidylcholine molecule.\r"

The ability of glucocorticoids to increase the amounts of this protein in macrophage cultures was also examined. p38 represents the naturally occurring, intact, NH2-terminally blocked human placental form of the protein termed calpactin II (or lipocortin I), for which partial amino acid sequence data and a complete amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA analysis have been reported. Our data demonstrated that, whereas p38 was an effective inhibitor of pancreatic phospholipase A2 in vitro, it was unable to inhibit either the release of arachidonate from cultured zymosan-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages or inflammation in a rat paw edema test. At comparatively high protein concentrations, p38 enhanced either arachidonate release from intact macrophages in vitro (0.5-10 micrograms/ml) or carrageenin-induced paw swelling in vivo (2.5 or 25 micrograms per injection). Furthermore, we were unable to detect induced amounts of p38 in cultures of glucocorticoid-treated peritoneal macrophages obtained from either mice or rats. Our data indicate that the antiphospholipase activity of p38 in vitro and the ability of p38 to serve as a receptor/kinase substrate may in no way relate to the putative ability of the protein to modify eicosanoid release from macrophages in vivo, so as to modulate the inflammatory process. Our data also raise the possibility that p38 (calpactin II) may not be a true representative of the lipocortin family of glucocorticoid-inducible antiinflammatory proteins, despite its ability to inhibit phospholipase A2 in vitro.\r"

We carried out experiments in isolated perfused terminal IMCDs to determine whether ANF (rat ANF 1-28) affects either osmotic water permeability (Pf) or urea permeability. In the presence of a submaximally stimulating concentration of vasopressin (10(-11) M), ANF (100 nM) significantly reduced Pf by an average of 46%. Lower concentrations of ANF also significantly inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Pf by the following percentages: 0.01 nM ANF, 18%; 0.1 nM, 46%; 1 nM, 48%. Addition of exogenous cyclic GMP (0.1 mM) mimicked the effect of ANF, decreasing Pf by an average of 48%. ANF also inhibited cyclic AMP-stimulated Pf by an average of 31%. ANF did not affect urea permeability, nor did it alter vasopressin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. We conclude that ANF at physiological concentrations causes a large inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated Pf in the rat terminal IMCD, and that cyclic GMP is the second messenger mediating the effect. ANF appears to act at a site distal to cyclic AMP generation in the chain of events linking vasopressin receptor binding to an increase in osmotic water permeability.\r"

The intrinsic protein fluorescence of native tct-PA was 54% that of sct-PA. Differences in steady state protein fluorescence were also noted with denaturation of these plasminogen activators, as well as in the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of the reduced, alkylated species by iodide. Using the chromogenic substrate H-D-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (S-2288), the catalytic efficiency of sct-PA was found to be 26% that of tct-PA, and this was primarily a reflection of the difference in Km. On addition of soluble fibrin monomer prepared with the tetrapeptide glycyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-proline (GPRP), the catalytic efficiency of both species increased by 13-fold for sct-PA and by 3.5-fold for tct-PA to approximately the same value. Using the fluorophore eosin iodoacetamide covalently coupled to the single free cysteine in the molecule, Cys 83, the microenvironment of the fibrin-binding site located near this residue was studied. On addition of soluble fibrin monomer to eosin-labeled tct-PA, no effect on eosin fluorescence was noted. Eosin-labeled tct-PA had 16% less eosin fluorescence than did sct-PA and on addition of soluble fibrin monomer to eosin-labeled sct-PA, a decrease in eosin fluorescence, approaching that of eosin coupled to tct-PA, was observed. Together, these structural and kinetic data suggest that sct-PA undergoes a conformational change on binding to fibrin monomer that leads to dramatic differences in catalytic efficiency of the single-chain species. In so doing, sct-PA bound to fibrin assumes the kinetic profile of tct-PA bound to fibrin.\r"

APIII (10(-8) M) attenuated the increase of intracellular free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, induced by 10(-8) M AVP (234.0 +/- 14.8 vs. 310.0 +/- 28.4 nM, P less than 0.01). Similar results were obtained in 45Ca2+ efflux experiments. APIII (10(-7) M), however, did not alter AVP-induced inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production, although the levels of inositol-1-phosphate were significantly reduced. The effect of APIII to block or attenuate AVP-induced Ca2+ mobilization was associated with an inhibition of AVP-stimulated cell shape change. The effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on cell shape, however, occurred at lower ANF concentrations than the effect on the Ca2+ mobilization. APIII stimulated production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in VSMC. The effect of APIII on AVP-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization was partially mimicked by the stable nucleotide 8-bromo cGMP and was not affected by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, methylene blue (10(-4) M). These results suggest that APIII exerts its vasodilatory effect, in part, by interference with vasopressor-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in vascular smooth muscle cells, perhaps by stimulating particulate guanylate cyclase and cGMP. However, an effect of ANF on the contractile mechanism at a site independent of Ca2+ release is also suggested by the present results.\r"

In evaluating the role of IFN as therapeutic agents in AIDS, we investigated the expression of IFN alpha and gamma receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from patients with AIDS, ARC, and heterosexual control subjects using radioiodinated IFN alpha 2 and IFN gamma. The binding characteristics of the 125I-IFN alpha and gamma to PBM were analyzed to determine receptor numbers and dissociation constants. PBM from controls expressed 498 +/- 247 IFN alpha receptor sites/cell (n = 17). However, eight patients with ARC and seven patients with AIDS had a mean number of IFN alpha receptor/cell of 286 +/- 235 (P less than 0.05) and 92 +/- 88 (P less than 0.001), respectively. This was consistent with elevated levels of serum acid-labile IFN alpha and cellular 2-5A synthetase activity in patients. Treatment of PBM from the AIDS patients with exogenous IFN alpha in vitro resulted in minimal 2-5A synthetase induction in comparison to controls. In contrast, the expression of IFN gamma receptors in ARC (n = 5) and AIDS (n = 4) patients remained normal. Thus the decrease in IFN alpha receptor expression and consequent hyporesponsiveness to IFN alpha raises the question of the usefulness of IFN alpha therapy in end-stage AIDS. The normal expression of IFN gamma receptors in AIDS patients suggests that IFN gamma may prove useful in attempts to provide immune reconstitution.\r"

  ".W": "Vasopressin (AVP) plays a key role in maximal urine concentration by stimulating NaCl reabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle (MAL) and by increasing water permeability in the medullary collecting tubules (MCT). These effects of AVP in MAL and MCT are mediated by cAMP. Alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation in MCT, and high ambient Ca2+ and PGE2 in MAL inhibit AVP-dependent cAMP production and thereby modulate urine concentration. The present study was undertaken to clarify the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of AVP-dependent cAMP production by these agents using microdissected mouse MAL and MCT. Preincubation of MCT and MAL with 1 microgram/ml pertussis toxin for 3 and 6 h, respectively, resulted in ADP-ribosylation of an approximately 41-kD protein, which was presumably an alpha subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein Gi. Epinephrine, 10(-6) M, via alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation, inhibited AVP-dependent cAMP production in MCT. Preincubation of MCT for 3 h with pertussis toxin abolished the inhibition of AVP-dependent cAMP production by epinephrine. High ambient Ca2+ and PGE2 both inhibited AVP-dependent cAMP production in MAL. Preincubation of MAL for 6 h with pertussis toxin abolished the inhibition by high ambient Ca2+ and attenuated the inhibition by PGE2. Preincubation of MCT or MAL with pertussis toxin for 1 h was ineffective in ADP-ribosylation and did not modify the inhibition of AVP-dependent cAMP production by these agents in both nephron segments. Our data suggest that the inhibition of AVP-dependent cAMP production by alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation in MCT, and by high ambient Ca2+ and adrenergic stimulation in MCT, and by high ambient Ca2+ and PGE2 in MAL, is mediated, at least in part, through activation of Gi.\r"

In the minor form of XLA, B lymphoid development terminates at the stage of immature B lymphocytes that produce truncated Ig heavy (H) chains composed of D-J-C(mu/delta), resulting from failure of VH gene rearrangement. Fusion of B cells from a patient with the minor form of XLA with mouse myeloma results in complementation of this defect; hybrid cells produce full-length H chains composed of VH-D-JH-C. The VH gene is of human origin. Complementation occurs independent of retention or loss of the human X (XLA) chromosome in the hybrid cells. These results indicate that the D-JH-C structure of the XLA B cells is fully functional for the subsequent rearrangement of a VH gene element, and that failure of immunoglobulin expression is susceptible to correction.\r"

Immunodiffusion and immunoblot procedures showed that these strains were identical. Profiles of isolated lipopolysaccharides from the 18 strains and the reference serogroup 6 strain were visualised in polyacrylamide gels stained with silver. Four strains from hospital A, isolated in 1982, 1984, and 1985 displayed similar lipopolysaccharide profiles which were different in relative mobility from those of hospitals B and C. Those from hospital B (12 strains isolated in 1983 and 1986) and C (one strain) were similar in relative mobility but different in colour. The strain from a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in hospital A displayed a lipopolysaccharide profile characteristic of hospital A. These reproducible profiles were all different in relative mobility from the reference serogroup 6 strain. They can be used as a marker system in epidemiological surveys of serologically identical serogroup 6 strains. Lipopolysaccharide patterns from strains isolated throughout the years in the same hospital were similar. This suggests an outgrowth from organisms inhabiting the plumbing system rather than reseeding from the Amsterdam mains supply.\r"

In this study a heparin and soluble theophylline mixture was used to measure accurately platelet numbers in patients with such pseudothrombocytopenia. In four normal volunteers, a theophylline concentration of more than 7 mg/ml produced no significant difference in platelet numbers between theophylline and heparin and EDTA-2K anticoagulated bloods. When blood treated with EDTA-2K was used in seven patients with pseudothrombocytopenia, falsely low platelet counts were observed in three patients immediately after sampling; in blood treated with theophylline, white cell and platelet counts remained unchanged for up to six hours after sampling. Microscopical examination of the EDTA-2K anticoagulated blood showed massive platelet clumping, but no aggregates were seen in theophylline anticoagulated blood. It is concluded that theophylline can be useful in the investigation of pseudothrombocytopenia when an automated cell counter is used.\r"

In patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome, plasma 5-S-cysteinyldopa levels did not differ from those in control subjects. Conversely, patients with malignant melanomas had significantly higher plasma 5-S-cysteinyldopa levels than did controls. Those with localized cutaneous malignant melanoma and no distant metastases (Stage I and II disease) had 5-S-cysteinyldopa levels twofold greater than those of control subjects, whereas the levels of those with regional lymph node involvement (Stage III disease) were fourfold greater than those of control subjects. Levels of those with extraregional metastases (Stage IV disease) were 7- to 450-fold higher than those of control subjects. Moreover, plasma 5-S-cysteinyldopa levels correlated with the spread of disease and were useful in distinguishing primary melanoma and Stages III and IV melanoma. We conclude that plasma 5-S-cysteinyldopa may be an important tool for identifying melanoma at an earlier, more curable stage and for following up patients at risk for the development of melanoma, for example, those with dysplastic nervus syndrome.\r"

To assess changes in airway caliber, we measured FEV1. To assess changes in NCA, we measured the maximal distance reached by neutrophils in a filter when neutrophils were challenged with the subject's serum in a Boyden chamber. Treatment with placebo did not change baseline FEV1 or serum NCA; however, FEV1 decreased and serum NCA increased (p less than 0.05) after inhalation of \"fog\". Treatment with SCG did not affect either FEV1 and baseline serum NCA. After inhalation of \"fog\", no significant bronchoconstriction nor NCA increase was observed in eight of 10 patients with maximal mean percent decrease in FEV1 of -4.26, SEM 0.99, and maximal mean percent increase in NCA of +8.6, SEM 5.28. In the two patients who developed a bronchoconstriction after challenge with SCG pretreatment, an associated significant increase in NCA was observed but did not affect baseline NCA. After inhalation of \"fog\", no significant decrease in FEV1 (maximal mean percent decrease FEV1, -6.71, SEM 0.17) nor significant increase in serum NCA (maximal mean percent increase NCA, +3.6, SEM 7.1) was observed in nine of 10 patients. After salbutamol, only one patient developed a bronchoconstrictive response to \"fog\" associated with a significant increase in serum NCA. These results suggest that both SCG and salbutamol may prevent the bronchoconstriction induced by \"fog\" by inhibiting mediator release.\r"

With FACS, basophil suspensions were prepared with a purity of 84% (range, 75% to 95%) and a recovery of 20% (range, 15% to 30%). The purified basophils had a total histamine content of 1.6 +/- 0.12 pg per cell, not differing significantly from total histamine content observed in \"total\" leukocyte suspensions (1.4 +/- 0.07 pg per basophil).

Sorted basophils from subjects with asthma released more histamine after IgE receptor activation (0.67 +/- 0.09 pg per cell) than basophils from healthy children (0.40 +/- 0.04 pg per cell; p less than 0.02). Expressed as percent release, no significant difference was observed (37 +/- 3.2% versus 30 +/- 2.7%).

This observation has been extended with specific immobilized IgG/antigen immune complexes to elicit mediator generation. An extract of Aspergillus fumigatus was covalently coupled to Sepharose beads and incubated with the IgG fraction of immune serum from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. These beads elicited generation of 7.72 +/- 1.7 pmol of LTC4 immunoreactive material (n = 5) from 1 X 10(6) normal eosinophils of greater than 86% purity, and significantly less LTC4 (0.73 +/- 0.19 pmol per 10(6) cells; n = 3) was produced by eosinophils after incubation with beads treated with IgG from normal nonimmune serum. The maximum antibody-dependent release achieved represented approximately 20% of that induced by the calcium ionophore (A23187). LTC4 was measured by radioimmunoassay and validated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amount of LTC4 generated was dependent on the concentration of A. fumigatus-specific IgG, and mediator release was completely abolished by prior adsorption of the IgG fraction onto Sepharose-protein A (Staphylococcus aureus). Grass pollen-specific IgG antibody/antigen complexes, in combination with Sepharose beads, also triggered generation of LTC4 immunoreactive material. There was no evidence to suggest that IgE/A. fumigatus immune complexes triggered LTC4 generation, although IgE myeloma protein, in association with Sepharose beads, was a weak stimulus. The efficacy of the IgG immune complex-dependent stimulation of eosinophils suggests a possible physiologic mechanism whereby these cells could participate in the inflammatory changes associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and similar allergic disorders.\r"

The relationship between mediator release and the number of monocytes that formed rosettes with immunoglobulin-coated indicator cells was examined. Patients with AD had twice as many IgA- and three times as many IgE-rosetting monocytes as normal donors (48 +/- 12% versus 27 +/- 10% and 40 +/- 15% versus 14 +/- 3%, respectively), and yet the amounts of IgA- and IgE-induced LTC4 released were similar for both groups. This apparent discrepancy did not result from a decreased capacity for arachidonate metabolism via the C5-lipoxygenase pathway, since stimulation of monocytes from patients and normal donors with the calcium ionophore A23187 induced similar amounts of LTC4 and LTB4 release (LTC4, 3.0 +/- 1.7 versus 3.0 +/- 1.0 ng/10(6) cells; LTB4, 5.3 +/- 0.7 versus 5.2 +/- 0.5 ng/10(6) cells, respectively). In addition, aggregated IgG-induced LTC4 release by monocytes of both groups was similar, concomitant with an equivalent number of IgG-rosetting cells. Determination of cytophilically bound IgG and IgE by flow cytometry demonstrated that monocytes from atopic patients had more IgG bound than monocytes from normal donors. Similar amounts of IgE were detected on most monocytes from both groups, despite the higher serum IgE levels of patients. However, approximately 3% to 8% of monocytes from atopic but not normal donors stained brightly for IgE, suggesting that relatively large amounts of cytophilic IgE were bound to a small percentage of the patients' monocytes. Challenge of monocytes with anti-IgE or anti-IgG induced release of similar amounts of LTC4 for both groups, despite the presence of more cytophilic IgG on monocytes from atopic donors. These data indicate that monocytes from patients with AD release LTC4 and LTB4 in response to challenge with aggregated IgE or anti-IgE, as well as aggregated IgG, IgA, and anti-IgG. However, under our in vitro conditions, stimulation of patients' monocytes with aggregated IgA or IgE was not associated with increased mediator release, despite higher percentages of IgA- and IgE-rosetting cells compared to normal donors.\r"

At the time of the first evaluation, a high number of CD8+ cells with an imbalance of CD4/CD8 ratio had been demonstrated in patients with HP. Consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage evaluations demonstrated a persistent increase of CD8+ cells and a reversal of CD4/CD8 ratio in patients who continued to be regularly exposed to etiologic antigens at work (W+). In the same cases, a persistent increase of NK cells was demonstrated. Cytotoxic cells demonstrated a persistently enhanced in vitro lytic function during the follow-up, even though there appeared to be a trend toward the normal range.

  ".W": "The effects of 2.5S nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), isolated from mouse submaxillary glands, on histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) were studied. In the absence of phosphatidylserine, NGF (1 ng/ml to 1 microgram/ml) did not cause histamine release from PMCs isolated from normal rats and those infected with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. However, when PMCs (greater than 97% pure) were preincubated with NGF and then challenged with worm antigen (Ag), there was a marked enhancement of histamine release (approximately twofold with a maximum effect at 10 ng/ml of NGF [3.8 X 10(-10) mol/L]) compared with the release induced by Ag alone. EGF (1 ng/ml to 1 microgram/ml) neither produced histamine release from PMCs in the presence of phosphatidylserine nor enhanced Ag-induced histamine release. This suggests that NGF acts directly on PMCs by activation of cell-surface receptors. The early kinetics of Ag-induced histamine release were altered by NGF that increased the initial rate at 15 seconds but did not prolong the overall duration of histamine release. Simultaneous addition of Ag and NGF did not cause enhanced histamine release; thus, some preincubation time with NGF (5 minutes or less) was required for the activation of PMCs. Moreover, after PMCs were activated by NGF, that state persisted for 1 hour, even when unbound NGF was removed by washing, and thereafter subsided gradually. Further studies revealed that NGF enhanced histamine release induced by concanavalin A, compound 48/80, and ionophore A23187. These results suggest that NGF might be an important molecule in inflammatory responses through the regulation of mediator release from mast cells.\r"

Sixty adults, with a history of ragweed-induced rhinoconjunctivitis, were matched according to sensitivity to ragweed pollen. Half took astemizole, 10 mg/day, and the rest took terfenadine, 60 mg twice daily. Medications were started 1 week before and continued daily until 1 week after the ragweed pollen season (7 weeks). If the trial medication was insufficient to keep symptoms well controlled, a steroid nasal spray and/or eye drops were used in the minimum dose that would ensure symptoms were not troublesome. Subjects completed a diary of nocturnal and daytime nasal and eye symptoms and recorded the amount of concomitant medications used. Astemizole showed greater efficacy than terfenadine in controlling rhinorrhea; in addition, the astemizole group used less nasal spray. Other nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and use of eye drops were similar in the two groups. Skin test sensitivity to serial dilutions of histamine and ragweed extract was determined 1 and 7 weeks after the start of the trial medication. More tachyphylaxis to histamine was shown by the subjects taking terfenadine, as demonstrated by a larger increase in skin sensitivity over the study period. However, a similar change was not observed for ragweed skin sensitivity. These results suggest that when the medication is started before and continued daily throughout the pollen season, astemizole is more efficacious than terfenadine in controlling nasal symptoms, but there is little difference for eye symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The availability and use of modular enteral components for tube feeding has increased dramatically in recent years. The preparation of such modular feedings can be quite confusing to enteral formula preparation personnel, especially when several components are utilized. At Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA, a policy of ordering modular feedings on the basis of the contribution of each component per 100 ml formula has been developed and adopted. The policy was adopted in order to reduce the amount of time the dietitian spends assisting the enteral formula aide with preparation of modular feedings, to maximize cost-effectiveness, and to provide the medical staff with standards by which to order modular feedings. Such standardization ensures accurate interpretation of the modular enteral formula order by the enteral nutrition aide. As the formula is changed in dilution or rate, the amounts of each component can be calculated with ease. The direct benefits of instituting this policy have been threefold: the medical staff consults with the clinical dietitians more frequently when ordering modular feedings; preparation and calculation time for modular feedings has decreased; and formula waste is reduced.\r"

  ".W": "All elderly patients with established urinary incontinence residing in an intermediate care facility during one year were evaluated for medical and urological conditions contributing to the incontinence; treatment was initiated for all diagnosed problems if possible. Unstable detrusor function (65%), sphincter weakness (13%), and overflow incontinence (10%) were all frequent urological causes, although several patients required extensive testing in addition to cystometrics to establish a complete diagnosis. Frequent nonurological causes of incontinence included behavioral problems (53%), immobility (45%), medication problems (24%), diabetes (18%), and local pathology (47%). Thirty-seven percent had three or more conditions identified. Treatment aimed at nonurological causes was more successful in ameliorating incontinence than urological medication; side effects were significant limitations to urological treatment success. Of the 22 patients who completed evaluation, treatment, and follow-up, five patients (23%) were cured, three (14%) showed at least a 65% decrease in incontinence, four (18%) showed at least a 30% decrease in incontinence, and 10 (45%) showed no change or worsened. We conclude that nonurological problems frequently contribute to urinary incontinence in long term care facilities; incontinence in some of these patients can be improved without urological therapy. Nonurological problems need careful definition and treatment; patients whose incontinence persists require comprehensive urological evaluation and therapy. A complete solution to incontinence in this setting may require safer drugs and better understanding of urinary pathophysiology.\r"

A training format for this procedure is proposed. The author, trained according to this format, found 49 polyps and three carcinomas among his first 365 randomly chosen patients. Of these 317 (87%) were asymptomatic, having no risk factors. The average distance of insertion was 53 cm and the average examination time was 20 minutes. The calculated cost for these 365 patients was approximately +60,000, and the estimated average cost for a potentially curable colorectal cancer detection was approximately +20,000. Although a relatively long examination time may be necessary for the beginner, the author concludes that the primary care physician can be readily trained to handle the 60 cm flexible sigmoidoscope safely and cost effectively.\r"

  ".U": "89009664\r", 
  ".W": "To see k information on T cell recognition of Mlsa determinants, hybridomas were prepared from a well-characterized F23.2+ (V beta 8.2+) T cell clone specific for three different ligands, i.e., 1) Mlsa determinants, 2) fowl gamma-globulin (F gamma G) plus self-H-2 (H-2d), and 3) allo-H-2, e.g., H-2p, determinants. Fusion of the clone to the BW5147 thymoma line produced a triple-reactive T hybridoma which generated two types of spontaneous variants. One type of variant (type I) lost Mlsa reactivity but retained reactivity to both F gamma G/H-2d and allo-H-2p. These variants, which were generated at high frequency, stained strongly with a mAb, A1.57, with idiotypic specificity for the TCR molecules of the parental clone. The second type of variant (type II) reacted to Mlsa determinants but showed no reactivity to F gamma G/H-2d or to allo-H-2p. These variants failed to express the A1.57 idiotypic determinants of the parent clone, but were F23.2+ (V beta 8.2+); nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis analysis suggested that these hybrids expressed a mixed TCR heterodimer composed of the parental clone beta-chain and the BW5147 alpha-chain. Three aspects of the data are very difficult to accommodate with the view that Mlsa, F gamma G, and allo-H-2 determinants are all recognized via a common TCR molecule: 1) the independent (and frequent) segregation of Mlsa reactivity from F gamma G/H-2d and allo-H-2p reactivity, 2) the retention of Mlsa reactivity by the type II variants despite loss of the parental clone alpha-chain, and 3) the loss of Mlsa reactivity by the type I variants despite high expression of the A1.57+ TcR molecules derived from the parental clone. The data support a model in which Mlsa determinants are recognized by a separate T cell structure, which we envisage as a monomorphic accessory molecule unrelated to the TCR. Since the type II hybridoma variants invariably retained quantitatively normal TcR expression, the triggering phase of anti-Mlsa responses appears to be TCR dependent. The model we favor is that anti-Mlsa/Mlsa interaction increases TCR binding with Ia epitopes to above the threshold required for cell triggering. A key feature of this model is that Mlsa and Ia determinants are recognized as separate structures rather than as a complex.\r"

  ".W": "Subpopulations of normal adult murine splenic B cells and a panel of murine B cell tumors were examined for their ability to bind murine IgM specifically. By using two-color flow cytometric analyses, we have demonstrated that 90 to 95% of surface (s)IgD+ B cells express surface membrane receptors for IgM (Fc mu R). The binding of pentameric murine IgM to splenocyte Fc mu R was IgM-specific since it was totally inhibited by other polymeric IgM proteins, but not by Ig of other H chain classes or by mAb specific for the murine IgG or IgE FcR. Binding of IgM to splenic cells was saturable. Fc mu R were co-expressed with the Fc gamma R as well as the Fc epsilon R on the majority of splenic B cells. Minor populations of splenic mononuclear cells expressed only an Fc mu R, Fc gamma R or Fc epsilon R. In a survey of B tumor cell lines representing different stages of B cell development, we observed that the Fc mu R was expressed on pre-B cell lines and that Fc mu R detection was maximal on immature B cell lines that expressed sIgM and low amounts of sIgD and Ia. Fc mu R were not detected on cell lines that had switched from sIgM to the expression of another sIg, or on plasmacytomas and hybridomas. The studies with normal splenocytes establish that the majority of sIgD+ B lymphocytes in adult BALB/c mice express surface membrane receptors that specifically bind IgM. The studies with B lineage tumor cells suggest that the expression of Fc mu R on B cells is developmentally regulated and that the pattern of expression exhibited by Fc mu R during B cell ontogeny differs from the patterns that have been previously found for IgG and IgE FcR. These observations raise the possibility that Fc mu R might have a functional significance in some aspect of B cell maturation and activation. By using a family of IgM H chain constant region domain deletional mutants, we have further demonstrated that, like the T cell Fc mu R, the B cell Fc mu R also requires a C mu 3 domain for binding to occur, raising the possibility that the T and B cell Fc mu R in mice may be structurally related molecules.\r"

We examined the expression of several cell surface Ag on lymph node cells from MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice before and after in vitro culture. There is an increase in the expression of Thy-1, L3T4, IL-2R, T cell activating protein, T cell receptor, and T3 complex on the surface of cultured cells. Cultured cells produced IL-3, IFN-gamma, and small but detectable amounts of IL-1 in addition to IL-2. Gamma irradiation of APC from young MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice or treatment of APC with a mAb (J11D) and C, completely abrogated their stimulatory capacity. These experiments suggest that B cells are the predominant APC responsible in the activation of autoreactive T cells in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice. Lymph node cells from C57BL/6-lpr/lpr or C3H-lpr/lpr mice were unable to spontaneously proliferate or produce IL-2. Lymph node cells from (MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr x C57BL/6-lpr/lpr) F1 mice or (C3H-lpr/lpr x MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr) F1 mice did proliferate and produced IL-2 after in vitro culture. Using T cells from these F1 animals and APC from each parental haplotype, we found that APC from MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice induced more proliferation and greater amounts of IL-2, when compared to APC from F1 animals. APC from C57BL6-lpr/lpr mice or C3H-lpr/lpr were unable to induce spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production. Therefore, B cells from MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice appear to possess unique features that enable them to activate autoreactive T cells more effectively than B cells from other mice bearing the lpr/lpr gene.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the effects of early and delayed treatments with anti-Ia mAb and IFN-gamma on murine CIA. Administration of anti-Ia mAb at the time of immunization with CII decreased the incidence and delayed the onset of arthritis, whereas anti-Ia treatments begun 2 wk after immunization had no effect upon either arthritis incidence or onset. Neither treatment protocol resulted in a significant decrease in antibody titer or proliferative response to CII. Because IFN-gamma increases Ia expression in a variety of cells, we determined its effect on arthritis incidence and onset. When IFN-gamma treatments were begun at the time of immunization the incidence of arthritis was increased and arthritis onset was more rapid. Treatment with IFN-gamma did not result in an increase in anti-CII antibody levels. These results support the importance of Ia expression in the induction of murine collagen-induced arthritis, and suggest that suppression with anti-Ia antibodies and augmentation with IFN-gamma are not the result of changes in the humoral response to CII, but may be due to local effects within the target organ.\r"

  ".W": "Human rIL-4 specifically induces the expression of the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) on normal B cells and on the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Jijoye. IL-4 does not induce the generation of the second messenger cAMP in Jijoye cells. PGE2 (at 10(-7) M) was found to inhibit by 50% the IL-4 mediated Fc epsilon R2/CD23 induction on Jijoye cells. The PGE2 half maximum inhibitory concentration (1 nM) was comparable to that inducing a half maximal increase of intracellular cAMP (4nM PGE2). 8-bromo-cAMP (10(-3) M), forskolin (10(-5) M), and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), which increase intracellular cAMP levels, also inhibited by 40 to 80% the IL-4 induced Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression on Jijoye cells. PGE2 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin also inhibited the IL-4-induced Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression on normal B lymphocytes. Taken together these data suggest that PGE2 inhibits the IL-4 induced Fc epsilon R2/CD23 through an increase of intracellular cAMP. In contrast, IFN-gamma, which strongly inhibits IL-4-mediated Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression on Jijoye cells, did not increase intracellular cAMP levels and thus probably acts through another mechanism. IFN-gamma and PGE2 did not inhibit binding of IL-4 to its receptor. It could be excluded that IFN-gamma and PGE2 were acting via an alteration/desensitization of the IL-4R inasmuch as 24 h pre-incubation of Jijoye cells with these agents affected neither the affinity of 125I-IL-4 for its receptor (Kd = 0.8 to 1.5 x 10(-10) M) nor the maximal number of binding sites per Jijoye cells (Bmax = 390 to 550). Furthermore, IFN-gamma and PGE2 did not affect the internalization and degradation of 125I-IL-4. These data demonstrate that PGE2 and IFN-gamma inhibit the IL-4-mediated induction of Fc epsilon R2/CD23 on B lymphocytes via different mechanisms that do not alter the interaction of IL-4 with its receptor.\r"

These NK cell lines, which were cytotoxic against NK-sensitive tumor targets and virally infected cells, also generated supernatants that selectively killed vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells while sparing noninfected cells. This soluble antiviral activity was completely neutralized by antibodies specific for TNF and lymphotoxin. Purified human rTNF also duplicated this specific cytotoxicity against vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells, as well as against CMV-, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-, and HSV-infected cells. The degree of cytotoxicity varied for the different viruses and depended on the cell type infected.

Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-activated blasts prepared from high density tonsil B cells were found to secrete IgG and IgM, but no IgE, when cultured in the presence of rIL-4. The differentiating activity of rIL-4 was totally blocked by a neutralizing anti-IL-4 antiserum, therefore demonstrating that the IgG/IgM-inducing activity of rIL-4 was an intrinsic property of IL-4. rIL-4 was only minimally inducing Ig production of blasts prepared from low density B cells, whereas it induced B cell blasts prepared from high density B cells to secrete a high amount of Ig. Delayed additions of the neutralizing anti-IL-4 antiserum demonstrated that a 48-h contact between IL-4 and B cell blasts was required for optimal Ig production. The IL-4-mediated IgG and IgM production was neither suppressed by IFN-gamma nor by anti-CD23 mAb 25, whereas these agents have been shown earlier to inhibit IgE production of enriched B cells cultured in the presence of IL-4. These data indicate that the IgG/IgM-inducing activity of IL-4 is not regulated like the IL-4-induced IgE production by enriched B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Under endotoxin-free conditions, unstimulated human PBMC do not release TNF-alpha, as measured in a sensitive assay with 51Cr release in 6 h from actinomycin D-treated WEHI 164 cells. IFN-gamma alone at less than or equal to 10,000 U/ml is insufficient to elicit TNF-alpha release. Similarly, the lymphokine-rich supernatant of PBMC stimulated by allogeneic cells is also insufficient to induce TNF-alpha release in a short term assay. However, when PBMC are first primed with IFN-gamma for 48 h and then exposed to lymphokine supernatant for 6 h, effector cells within the PBMC population are triggered to express TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. All of the measured cytotoxicity is attributable to TNF-alpha because it could be abolished by a specific anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing mAb. Although IFN-gamma serves to prime PBMC in this assay system, it fails to trigger the release of TNF-alpha. Instead, a second lymphokine (provisionally termed \"cytotoxicity triggering factor\" (CTF) is required to induce TNF-alpha release from IFN-gamma-primed human PBMC. In kinetic studies, IFN-gamma priming was optimal when PBMC were exposed to IFN-gamma (150 U/ml) for 48 h. In contrast to the prolonged interval for priming, CTF need be present for 6 h or less for maximal induction of TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. In dose-response studies, IFN-gamma priming (48 h) required at least 4 U/ml and was complete with 20 to 100 U/ml. By using fully primed PBMC, the response to CTF followed a sigmoidal dose-response curve, which allowed the quantitation of CTF in half-maximal units. Activated Th lymphocytes constitute one cellular source for CTF. CTF is produced by cloned allorective T3+T4+T8-M1- Th cells after alloantigen stimulation, and also by nylon wool-purified T cells after stimulation with PMA and A23187 calcium ionophore. Unstimulated T cells do not release CTF. In physicochemical studies, CTF activity elutes from Sephadex G-100 as a major discrete peak of Mr 55 kDa and minor peaks of 14 kDa and greater than 150 kDa. On the basis of multiple criteria, CTF is distinguishable from several other cytokines: IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, GM-CSF, MIF, CSF-1, TNF-alpha, and lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). We conclude that, by acting together, IFN-gamma and CTF provide a lymphokine pathway whereby Ag-responsive human Th cells induce the immunologic release of TNF-alpha from effector cells present in PBMC.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of heat on IL-1 beta biosynthesis was investigated in both THP-1 cells, a myelomonocytic cell line which can be induced to make IL-1 alpha and beta, and human peripheral blood adherent monocytes (PBMC). Induction of THP-1 cells with LPS at 39 to 41 degrees C for 2 to 4 h resulted in the expected increased synthesis of the heat-shock proteins hsp 70 and hsp 90 but decreased synthesis of the IL-1 beta precursor protein, p35 (and its mRNA), compared with control cells at 37 degrees C. This appeared to be a direct effect on p35 synthesis rather than a block in LPS induction because heat also acted on preinduced cells. PBMC similarly incubated for 4 h with LPS required a temperature of 41 to 42 degrees C to induce hsp and show a decrease in p35 synthesis. Chemical inducers of the heat-shock response (heavy metals, sulphydryl reagents) were also effective inhibitors of IL-1 beta biosynthesis. A correlation was seen between the extent of IL-1 beta reduction and the level of hsp induction by chemical inducers in both THP-1 cells and PBMC which suggests that the two responses are linked. In addition, a gold salt currently used for therapy of chronic inflammation, auranofin, induced hsp and inhibited IL-1 beta biosynthesis, whereas a second salt, sodium aurothiomalate, did neither. These results support the hypothesis that elevated temperature is one of the physiologic signals for down-regulation of IL-1 beta biosynthesis through a mechanism related to the induction of hsp.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic basis for the expression of a latent VH allotype in the rabbit was investigated. VH region cDNA libraries were produced from spleen mRNA derived from a homozygous a2a2 rabbit expressing an induced latent VHa1 allotype and, for comparison, from a normal homozygus a1a1 rabbit expressing nominal VHa1 allotype. The deduced amino acid sequences of the nominal VHa1 cDNA were concordant with previously published VHa1 protein sequences. A comparison of two complete VH-DH-JH and six partial VHa1 sequences reveals highly conserved sequence within VH framework regions (FR) and considerable diversity in complementarity-determining regions and D region sequences. Two functional JH genes or alleles are evident. Amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal 15 residues of pooled affinity-purified latent VHa1 H chain showed complete sequence identity with the nominal VHa1 sequences. Possible latent VHa1-encoding cDNA clones, derived from the a2a2 rabbit, were selected by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the VHa1 allotype-associated segments of the first and third framework regions (FR1 and FR3). cDNA sequence analysis reveals that the 5' untranslated regions of nominal and latent VHa1 cDNA were virtually identical to each other and to previously reported sequences associated with VHa2 and VHa-negative genes. Moreover, some latent VHa1 genes encode FR1 segments that are essentially homologous to the corresponding segment of a nominal VHa1 allotype. In contrast, other putative latent genes display blocks of VHa1 sequence in either FR1 or FR3 that are flanked by blocks of sequence identical to other rabbit VH genes (i.e., VHa2 or VHa-negative). These composite sequences may be directly encoded by composite germ-line VH genes or may be the products of somatically generated recombination or gene conversion between genes encoding latent and nominal allotypes. The data do not support the hypothesis that latent genes are the result of extensive modification by somatic point mutation.\r"

Testing of numerous tumor cell lines and tumor tissue sections showed that Me14/D12-defined Ag was present not only on melanoma but also on other tumor lines of neuroectodermal origin such as gliomas and neuroblastomas and on some lymphoblastic B cell lines, on monocytes and macrophages. Immunoprecipitation by mAb Me14/D12 of lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled melanoma cells analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed two polypeptide chains of 33 and 38 KDa, both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the two chains were present at the cell surface as a dimeric structure. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the two chains of 33 and 38 KDa had isoelectric points of 6.2 and 5.7, respectively. Treatment of the melanoma cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, resulted in a reduction of the Mr from 33 to 24 KDa and from 38 to 26 KDa. Peptide maps obtained after Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion showed no shared peptides between the two chains. Although biochemical data indicate that Me14/D12 molecules do not correspond to any known MHC class II Ag, their dimeric structure, tissue distribution, and regulation of IFN-gamma suggest that they could represent a new member of the MHC class II family.\r"

  ".W": "Peritoneal macrophages (PM), obtained from 39 healthy women with normal laparoscopy findings, were stimulated with the ionophore A23187 or/and arachidonic acid (AA) both in adherence and in suspension. AA lipoxygenase metabolites were determined by reversed-phase HPLC. The major metabolites identified were 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), leukotriene (LT)B4 and LTC4. The 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 20-carboxy-LTB4, and 15-HETE were not detected. Incubations of adherent PM with 2 microM A23187 induced the formation of LTB4, 110 +/- 19 pmol/10(6) cells, 5-HETE, 264 +/- 53 pmol/10(6) cells and LTC4, 192 +/- 37 pmol/10(6) cells. When incubated with 30 microM exogenous AA, adherent PM released similar amounts of 5-HETE (217 +/- 67 pmol/10(6) cells), but sevenfold less LTC4 (27 +/- 12 pmol/10(6) cells) (p less than 0.01). In these conditions LTB4 was not detectable. These results indicate that efficient LT synthesis in PM requires activation of the 5-lipoxygenase/LTA4 synthase, as demonstrated previously for blood phagocytes. When stimulated with ionophore, suspensions of Ficoll-Paque-purified PM produced the same lipoxygenase metabolites. The kinetics of accumulation of the 5-lipoxygenase/LTA4 synthase products in A23187-stimulated adherent cells varied for the various metabolites. LTB4 reached a plateau by 5 min, whereas LTC4 levels increased up to 60 min, the longest incubation time studied. Levels of 5-HETE were maximal at 5 min, and then slowly decreased with time. Thus, normal PM, in suspension or adherence, have the capacity to produce significant amounts of 5-HETE, LTB4, and LTC4. The profile of lipoxygenase products formed by the PM and the reactivity of this cell to AA and ionophore A23187 are similar to those of the human blood monocyte, but different from those of the human alveolar macrophage.\r"

By using various nonautoimmune strains of mice including H-2 or Igh congenic or recombinant mice, the levels and clonotypes of anti-DNA antibodies elicited by the malaria infection were analyzed in relation to the expression of the MHC or Igh gene. Our results showed there were little, if any, differences in serum anti-DNA levels and their clonotypes among B10 and B6 H-2 congenic mice. In contrast, malaria-induced IgG anti-DNA responses markedly differed quantitatively and clonotypically between murine strains bearing the Ighb allotype and those bearing the Igha, Ighj, Ighd, or Ighn allotype. The latter group of mice produced approximately 5 to 10 times more IgG anti-DNA antibodies than the former group of mice. Clonotypically, mice bearing the Ighb allotype developed high alkaline anti-DNA antibodies of pH 8.0 to 8.5, whereas non-Ighb mice failed to express such alkaline anti-DNA spectrotypes, and exhibited more neutral spectrotypes (pH 7.0 to 8.0). Studies on the Igh recombinant mice indicated that the observed quantitative and clonotypical differences in IgG anti-DNA production was not associated with the variable region, but with the constant region of the Igh gene complex. Our results have suggested that IgG anti-DNA responses occurring as a result of polyclonal B cell activation during the course of malaria infection markedly differs quantitatively and clonotypically among murine strains and appear to be controlled at least in part by the Igh-C gene or gene(s) closely linked to it.\r"

  ".U": "89009708\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells from the lymph nodes of MRL/lpr/lpr mice could respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-2-acetate (TPA) and A23187 by proliferation, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2R (IL-2R) expression. However, the optimal response was significantly less than that of normal T cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the relatively inert nature of these cells, the expression of the T cell early competence genes, IL-2R and c-myc, was examined by Northern blot analysis and nuclear run-on assays. In resting lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells, IL-2R mRNA was not detected, whereas the expression of c-myc mRNA was slightly enhanced compared to that of normal T cells. TPA and A23187 synergistically induced both IL-2R and c-myc mRNA expression by the lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells, as well as by normal T cells. However, the amounts of specific mRNA induced in the former were much less than those in the latter. Cycloheximide treatment caused the TPA/A23187-stimulated lpr cells to express large amounts of c-myc mRNA, but not IL-2R mRNA. The deficient expression of c-myc and its correction by cycloheximide treatment were also observed in Con A-stimulated lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells. Run-on transcription assays revealed that the enhancing effect of cycloheximide was most likely at the posttranscriptional level. These findings suggest that two separate mechanisms differentiated by their sensitivity to cycloheximide can inhibit the accumulation of mRNA for early competence genes in lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells. These mechanisms may prevent the full activation of the lpr T cells and lead to abnormal differentiation of these cells.\r"

We investigated the expression of J2 virus mRNA in relationship with the proliferative ability and tumoricidal activity of GG2EE cells exposed to biologic response modifiers (BRM). Calcium ionophore (Ca2+I), picolinic acid (PA), or IFN-gamma were employed to activate GG2EE cells. Each BRM was due to inhibit the proliferation of GG2EE cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only Ca2+I or the combined treatment with PA plus IFN-gamma induced tumoricidal GG2EE cells. J2 virus mRNA expression was not affected by PA or IFN-gamma, but it was dramatically decreased by Ca2+I or PA plus IFN-gamma. These results indicated that the expression of J2 mRNA can be inhibited in GG2EE cells by appropriate BRM such as Ca2+I or IFN-gamma plus PA. In contrast, the expression of 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA was augmented to similar levels by treatment of the GG2EE cells with IFN-gamma alone or in combination with PA. The down-regulation of J2 mRNA expression was not associated with the antiproliferative activity of the BRM but rather with their ability to induce tumoricidal activity. These results suggest that the process of activation of tumoricidal macrophages also triggers a mechanism(s) of resistance to viral mRNA expression. Moreover, the finding that IFN-gamma or PA inhibit cell proliferation but not J2 mRNA expression indicates that the intracellular targets of these BRM are intact, independent from and unaffected by J2 virus expression.\r"

Purification of the inhibitor to relative homogeneity was achieved by reverse phase, HPLC with a gradient of acetonitrile in dilute acetate buffer. Inhibitory activity eluted between 30 and 35% acetonitrile. The active fraction contained less than 30 pg/ml PGE by RIA which was insufficient to inhibit proliferation and may actually have been stimulatory. Inhibition comparable to that produced by the ascites fraction required greater than 300 pg/ml of PGE. This low m.w.

Nuclear damage of this type is not seen when cells are killed by antibody and C. The role of nuclear damage in the T cell-mediated killing process as well as the mechanism by which the killer cell induces this damage are unknown; however, accumulating evidence suggests that cytolysis may depend on induction of nuclear damage. The exocytosed contents of CTL granules are thought by many workers to mediate target cell lysis. We have now determined whether lytic granules also induce nuclear damage (DNA fragmentation) in cells which they lyse. They do not. In addition, no DNA fragmentation was detected in nuclei incubated with lytic granules or activated CTL. In summary, our results suggest that target cell DNA fragmentation induced by CTL is mediated neither by lytic granules nor by a CTL-derived endonuclease and support the view that the target cell is itself responsible for the internal damage it sustains.\r"

When Ia+ KC were modified with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, these cells did not induce a proliferative response in the TNP-specific, 1-Ek-restricted Th1 clone SE-4 (less than 5% of control). Analysis of supernatants generated from SE-4 cells incubated with these non-stimulatory accessory cells revealed low levels of IL-3 and IFN-gamma, but an absence of IL-2, when compared with supernatants generated from SE-4 cells stimulated with TNP-modified cultured Langerhans' cells that contain high levels of all of these lymphokines. Incubation of SE-4 cells with TNP-modified Ia+, but not Ia- KC or FITC-modified Ia+ KC, resulted in unresponsiveness to subsequent stimulation with TNP-modified functional accessory cells. Blocking studies with anti-class II MHC mAb revealed that the induction of unresponsiveness by hapten-modified Ia+ KC was restricted to the I-Ek molecule. Thus, the Ag and MHC specificities of unresponsiveness induced by TNP-modified Ia+ KC were identical to those observed for the proliferation of this clone in response to TNP-modified functional accessory cells. These data indicate the existence of a naturally occurring population of Ia+ cells that, after hapten-modification, induce an unresponsive state instead of proliferation of T cells.\r"

IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are therefore implicated in the immunologic destruction of beta-cells in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The objective of the present study was to define the effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on the function and viability of murine pancreatic islet beta-cells in vitro. Exposure of islets for 3 days to 200 U/ml of either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha did not affect glucose-stimulated insulin release, but at higher concentrations (2000 U/ml) of either cytokine there was significant inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release. In combination, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha each at 200 U/ml caused significant inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release; at 2000 U/ml glucose-stimulated insulin release was abolished. In time-course experiments, glucose-stimulated insulin release from islets exposed to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha each at 1000 U/ml was significantly increased at 4-h (twofold increase compared with control islets), decreased back to control levels at 18 h, significantly inhibited by 24 h (threefold decrease compared with control islets), and completely abolished by 48 h. The progressive impairment of beta-cell function mediated by IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha was associated with morphologic derangement of the islets that were almost totally disintegrated by day 6 of exposure to the cytokines. At day 6, insulin content of the islets was significantly reduced by exposure to TNF-alpha but not IFN-gamma. The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha resulted in a further dose-dependent depletion in insulin content compared with TNF-alpha alone. The synergistic functional and cytotoxic effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are consistent with a direct role for these cytokines in the destruction of beta-cells in insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

As an approach to clarifying the mechanism of action IL-1, the effects of IL-1 on ODC activity were examined in various cell lines whose proliferation was either suppressed or enhanced by IL-1. The proliferation of all cell types used in these experiments was markedly suppressed by a specific ODC inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO), substantiating the crucial role of ODC activity for cell proliferation. ODC activity also was considerably suppressed by IL-1 in those cells on which IL-1 exerts an antiproliferative effect, such as a human melanoma cell line (A375) and malignant human mammary cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D). On the other hand, ODC activity was stimulated in cells that are stimulated to proliferate in response to IL-1, such as a mouse helper T cell line (D10.G4.1), a NK cell-like cell line (YT), and a human glioblastoma cell line (U373 MG). The effect of IL-1 on ODC activity preceded and directly correlated in a dose-dependent manner with its effect on DNA synthesis. Furthermore, putrescine, a product of the ODC reaction and a precursor of polyamines, was able to overcome most, but not all, the antiproliferative action of IL-1 in A375 melanoma cells, which were the most sensitive to suppression by IL-1. However, putrescine did not reverse the cytostatic effect of IL-1 on MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines. In contrast, putrescine, like IL-1, exhibited some co-mitogenic activity on D10.G4.1 cells. Because the biological activities of TNF and IL-1 show considerable overlap, the effect of TNF on ODC activity also was examined. TNF had an antiproliferative effect on A375 cells and stimulated the proliferation of U373 MG cells. The ODC activity in A375 cells was suppressed by TNF, and the ODC activity in U373 MG cells was stimulated by TNF. Putrescine also partially overcame the inhibitory effect of TNF. These results suggest that the regulation of ODC activity may be a key component in the antiproliferative and proliferative action of IL-1 and TNF in some tumor cell types.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of 12 cytokines to induce NO2- or H2O2 release from murine peritoneal macrophages was tested by using resident macrophages, or macrophages elicited with periodate, casein, or thioglycollate broth. Elevated H2O2 release in response to PMA was observed in resident macrophages after a 48-h incubation with IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, or CSF-GM. Of these, only IFN-gamma induced substantial NO2- secretion during the culture period. The cytokines inactive in both assays under the conditions tested were IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, CSF-M, and transforming growth factor-beta 1. Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma for 48 h in the presence of LPS inhibited H2O2 production but augmented NO2- release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog NG-monomethylarginine inhibited NO2- release but not H2O2 production. Although neither TNF-alpha nor TNF-beta induced NO2- synthesis on its own, addition of either cytokine together with IFN-gamma increased macrophage NO2- production up to six-fold over that in macrophages treated with IFN-gamma alone. Moreover, IFN-alpha or IFN-beta in combination with LPS could also induce NO2- production in macrophages, as was previously reported for IFN-gamma plus LPS. These data suggest that: 1) tested as a sole agent, IFN-gamma was the only one of the 12 cytokines capable of inducing both NO2- and H2O2 release; 2) the pathways leading to secretion of H2O2 and NO2- are independent; 3) either IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha/beta or IFN-alpha/beta/gamma and LPS can interact synergistically to induce NO2- release.\r"

  ".W": "PGD2 undergoes extensive isomerization in vivo followed by metabolism by 11-ketoreductase to yield a family of biologically active isomeric PGF2 compounds, including 9, alpha 11 beta-PGF2. Because immunologically activated human mast cells produce substantial quantities of PGD2 and eosinophils accumulate around mast cells at sites of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, the ability of eosinophils to metabolize PGD2 was investigated. Purified human circulating eosinophils from four different donors transformed PGD2 to 9, alpha 11 beta-PGF2 and 12-epi-9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The formation of these compounds increased rapidly during the first 30 min of incubation of eosinophils with PGD2 and tended to plateau at approximately 2 h. Detection and quantification of the formation of 9 beta,11 beta-PGF2 and its 12-epi isomer was accomplished by a negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assay. On one occasion, eosinophils from one donor also transformed PGD2 to two additional isomeric PGF2 compounds, the stereochemical structures of which were not identified. The ability of eosinophils to produce PGD2 was then investigated. After stimulation with 2 microM A23187, the major cyclooxygenase product formed was thromboxane B2 (2247 pg/10(6) eosinophils) whereas only small quantities of PGD2 were produced (50 pg/10(6) eosinophils). Inasmuch as PGF2 compounds can exert biologic actions that differ from those of PGD2, this ability of eosinophils to transform PGD2 to PGF2 compounds could alter the local biologic effects of PGD2 released from adjacent mast cells and thus may represent a physiologically relevant mast cell-eosinophil interaction.\r"

  ".W": "We report on a novel peptide that blocks the neuroendocrine hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) helper signal for IFN-gamma production by direct interaction with the hormone. The AVP-binding nonapeptide has the sequence Thr-Met-Lys-Val-Leu-Thr-Gly-Ser-Pro (binding peptide). AVP and its 6-amino acid N-terminus cyclic ring pressinoic acid (PA) are both capable of replacing the IL-2 requirement for IFN-gamma production by mouse splenic lymphocytes. We show that the AVP-binding peptide specifically and reversibly blocks AVP help in IFN-gamma production, but fails to block the helper signal of PA. Thus the intact AVP molecule and not just the N-terminal cyclic ring is important for interaction with the binding peptide. AVP interacts with the binding peptide with an apparent KD of approximately 50 nM. The AVP-binding peptide does not inhibit AVP interaction with its receptor on lymphocytes. Interestingly, whereas the AVP-binding peptide does not block the PA helper signal for IFN-gamma induction, the complex of AVP and binding peptide does reversibly block the PA signal. The AVP family of hormones requires conformational flexibility for signal transduction. Thus, we hypothesize that the AVP-binding peptide restricts this flexibility and converts AVP into an antagonist of its own action.\r"

All lines tested had surface phenotypes of CD3+ CD4+ CD8-, and showed S. japonicum soluble egg Ag (SEA)-specific proliferation requiring HLA-DR-restricted Ag presentation. Of these fractions of SEA separated by gel filtration, Fraction II (m.w. 7,000 to 18,000) and III (m.w. 7,000) induced strong proliferation of T cell lines, whereas fraction I (m.w. 18,000+) failed to induce detectable proliferation to any T cell lines tested. One of the T cell lines was cloned by micromanipulation: two of eight clones responded only to fraction II, and six to both fractions II and III. We observed that four of eight clones tested produced IL-2 in response to SEA, and three of them were able to transfer S. japonicum egg-specific granulomatous hypersensitivity in vitro to an HLA haplo-identical individual without previous schistosome infection. These immunopathologic functions of T cell clones seemed to be activated by at least two distinct epitopes of SEA. Our present observations suggest that at least two distinct CD4+ human T cells, both of which recognize epitopes expressed on SEA molecules of less than 18 kDa, might have critical roles in granulomatous hypersensitivity to eggs of S. japonicum in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Murine listeriosis is a classical model for investigating mechanisms of cellular immunity, which involves interaction of macrophages and T lymphocytes. The early course of this experimental infection is under control of a limited number of genes in the murine host. In the present study, we asked whether the early efficient control of bacterial growth in the liver of resistant mice is related to the expression of a more rapid specific immune response in this organ than in susceptible mice. Therefore, we compared the frequencies of Listeria monocytogenes-reactive T cells in blood, spleen, and liver of resistant C57BL/6 and susceptible C3H/He Past mice after i.v. injection of a high dose of Listeria (9 x 10(5) CFU). T cells were titrated through their ability to locally transfer a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to viable L. monocytogenes, an effector function potentially relevant to the early step of protective mechanisms. We observed (1) a 9- and 4-fold increase by day 1 in the frequency of Listeria-reactive transfer units in the blood of C57BL/6 and C3H mice, respectively, (2) no increase in the number of Listeria-reactive transfer units in the spleen of 2-day infected mice of both strains, and (3) a 90-fold increase, at day 2, in the number of Listeria-reactive transfer units in the liver of resistant C57BL/6 compared with only a 9-fold increase in the liver of susceptible C3H/He. These results suggest that the ability of C57BL/6 mice to control the early bacterial growth (0 to 48 h) in their liver, may be related to a rapid influx of L. monocytogenes-reactive T lymphocytes.\r"

The competition of each heterologous mAb relative to the competition of the homologous mAb was determined. By grouping the competition patterns of the 21 mAb, it was apparent that at least two epitopes (E1 and E2) were important to the antiviral function of rHuIFN-gamma.

With the use of unique probes obtained from such clones, the order and orientation of the mouse lambda-gene segments were determined by analyzing patterns of DNA deletion associated with lambda-gene rearrangements in various cell lines. All V and C gene segments were found to be in the same transcriptional orientation, and V2 and V1 were found not to be next to each other, thus supporting the gene order V2-C2-C4-V1-C3-C1.\r"

Anti-class I antibody-binding assays show that about 30% of class I Ag present on cell surface are endocytosed within 1 h. Electronmicroscopic investigations reveal that, like other well established receptor molecules, internalization of HLA is mediated by coated pits and coated vesicles. The endocytosed Ag are transferred from endosomes to trans-Golgi reticulum and trans-Golgi cisternae, suggesting recycling of these Ag back to the cell surface. In the presence of phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, there is a modest increase in the rate of internalization. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that class I Ag on monocytes/macrophages behave like receptor molecules. Malignant transformation of monocytic cells apparently causes the loss of this property of class I Ag.\r"

  ".W": "A biphasic dose response curve was observed when the bone marrow-derived cell line FDCP1, used as an indicator line for IL-3 bioassays, was exposed to supernatants from some activated T cell clones but not others. The active component which inhibited proliferation at the higher supernatant concentrations appeared to be IFN-gamma, based on the following observations. 1) Only those culture supernatants which contained IFN-gamma gave a biphasic dose response curve; 2) with these supernatants, an anti-IFN-gamma mAb augmented the proliferation of FDCP1 cells at the higher supernatant concentrations; and 3) rIFN-gamma profoundly inhibited the proliferation of FDCP1 cells stimulated with rIL-3 or rIL-4. rTNF-alpha inhibited FDCP1 proliferation only to a modest extent, yet the combination of rTNF-alpha + rIFN-gamma provided greater inhibition than each agent alone. The proliferation of a second bone marrow-derived cell line, DA1, was not inhibited by rIFN-gamma or rIFN-gamma + rTNF-alpha when stimulated with rIL-3 or recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF). Fresh bone marrow cells also showed a suboptimal proliferative response when stimulated with T cell supernatants containing IFN-gamma, and this response was augmented considerably upon the addition of anti-IFN-gamma mAb. Bone marrow cell proliferation was observed upon exposure to rIL-3, rIL-4, or rGM-CSF, and these responses were inhibited by rIFN-gamma; rTNF-alpha also produced a synergistic effect with these cells. Bone marrow cell colony formation stimulated by rIL-3 or rGM-CSF also was inhibited by rIFN-gamma. Colony formation in bone marrow cell cultures was not observed in response to rIL-4. Collectively, these results suggest that Th1 cells, which in addition to IL-3 and GM-CSF also produce IFN-gamma, may regulate hemopoietic cell proliferation and colony formation differently from the way Th2 cells do, which do not produce IFN-gamma.\r"

  ".W": "Mononuclear phagocytes are known to produce both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and a specific PA inhibitor, PAI-2. In this study we have investigated the effects of calcitriol and PMA-induced differentiation on the comparative expression of PA and PAI in monoblast-like U937 cells. Cells were incubated for 96 h in the presence or absence of 50 nM calcitriol. After transfer into serum-free medium, the cells were cultured for 48 h with PMA (0 to 50 ng/ml). PA and PAI activities of conditioned media and cell lysates were measured with a plasminogen dependent colorimetric assay. Control cells uniformly secreted PAI activity (70.3 +/- 24.9 PAI U/ml), while calcitriol pretreatment induced the cells to secrete PA activity (52.6 +/- 47.2 milli-Ploug unit/ml). PMA induced secretion of PAI activity in calcitriol-pretreated cells to levels 4.6- to 8.3-fold greater than controls (p less than 0.05). Parallel effects on PA and PAI activities were seen in cell lysates. To determine how changes in the expression of u-PA and PAI-2 might account for these effects, mRNA for u-PA and PAI-2 were assessed by Northern blot analysis. Calcitriol induced an increase in u-PA mRNA with a marked reduction in PAI-2 mRNA. PMA alone induced modest increases in both mRNA species. In calcitriol pre-treated cells, PMA induced a moderate increase in u-PA mRNA and a marked increase in PAI-2 mRNA. We conclude that agonist-specific differentiation of U937 cells modulates the expression of PA and PAI activities by altering the proportionate biosynthesis of u-PA and PAI-2 proteins. The ability of mononuclear phagocytes to control plasminogen activation at inflammatory foci may therefore be contingent on the independent regulation of u-PA and PAI-2 gene expression.\r"

We also analyzed lambda-producing hybridomas from nontransgenic mice. Surprisingly, all but one of the transgenic lambda-hybridomas co-produce kappa L chains. Also, in contrast to transgenic kappa-hybridomas, most lambda-hybridomas have rearranged endogenous kappa genes despite the presence of transgenic kappa-chains and endogenous H chains. Analysis of spleen cells and hybridomas from nontransgenic mice shows that about 20% of lambda-producing B cells in the spleen co-produce kappa, and a similar proportion of lambda-hybridomas from normal spleens produce both kappa- and lambda-chains. The data argue strongly against the strictly sequential expression of kappa and lambda genes. We present a new model for the regulation of kappa and lambda gene expression, whose key feature is the distinction between a kappa cell lineage in which Ig gene rearrangement is susceptible to feedback by a complete antibody molecule at the pre-B cell stage, and a kappa lambda B cell lineage which does not show feedback inhibition during B cell development.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of the characterized Ly-1+ B cell lymphomas of B10.H-2aH-4bp/Wts origin (the CH series) bear surface Ig related by Ag specificity or idiotype or both. To determine the genetic basis for these structural similarities, we have sequenced the VH and VL region genes expressed by 10 CH lymphomas, and have compared their VH and V kappa gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis to one another and to those of four other CH lymphomas. Sequence analysis identified only five different VH, and seven different VL genes, and indicated that these V genes are essentially unmutated. CH lymphomas which express the identical VH gene share at least one idiotope. Thus, the basis for shared idiotype and specificity is due in most cases to the use of the same V gene. This restriction in V gene expression is not due to the preferential use of V genes of any particular VH family or VL group, as the expressed V genes belong to four different VH families and four V kappa groups, and include V lambda 1 and V lambda 2. We hypothesize that Ag selection accounts for the restriction in V gene usage among CH lymphomas.\r"

The cDNA sequence predicts a 40-kDa polypeptide with the typical features of a glycosylated integral membrane protein.

  ".U": "89009820\r", 
  ".W": "The biological role of the murine IFN-gamma endogenously secreted during cell activation has been probed by the use of a rat mAb (AN18) that specifically neutralizes its activity. When An18 mAb is added to the cultures of BALB/c and C57BL/6 nylon nonadherent spleen cells (naSpc) stimulated for 18 h with 1000 U of IL-2, the normally released IFN-gamma can no longer be detected in the supernatants and the IL-2-induced proliferative response is markedly reduced as compared with control cultures set up in the presence of an unrelated rat mAb. By contrast, the increased natural cytotoxicity is not affected. The 96-h culture of both BALB/c and C57BL/6 naSpc in the presence of 1000 U of IL-2 resulted in marked lymphocyte proliferation and generation of lymphokine-activated killer activity. The presence of An18 mAb strongly inhibited both functions. Similarly, when naSpc were stimulated with mitomycin C-inactivated allogeneic leukocytes in the presence of An18 mAb, the normal proliferative response and specific cytotoxicity were almost abolished, whereas the secretion of IL-2 was in no way affected. Lymphocytes recovered from 3-day cultures stimulated by IL-2 or allogeneic cells in the presence of An18 mAb displayed a decrease of the expression of the p55 chain of IL-2R, as shown by flow cytofluorimetry. Moreover, binding experiments with 125I-labeled IL-2 showed that lymphocytes from allostimulated cultures set up in the presence of An18 mAb display a decreased number of low affinity and almost no high affinity IL-2R as compared with control cultures. These data show that endogenous IFN-gamma plays an obligatory role for the de novo induction of cytolytic activity in lymphokine-activated killer cells and CTL, most probably by affecting the membrane expression of high affinity IL-2R.\r"

The Moloney murine leukemia virus myc oncogene (M-MuLV (myc], carried by an amphotropic MuLV helper, induced tumors in NIH Swiss and NFS/N mice after a relatively long latency (8 to 24 wk). Tumor masses appeared in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry of the tumor cells indicated that approximately 50% were positive for Thy 1.2. Most of these tumors also expressed one or more other cell surface markers of thymocytes and mature T cells (CD4, CD8). Southern blot hybridization revealed genomic rearrangements for the TCR beta genes. The TCR beta analysis suggested that the M-MuLV(myc)-induced Thy 1.2+ tumors were derived from somewhat less mature cells than tumors induced by M-MuLV, which is a classical non-acute retrovirus lacking an oncogene. The remainder of the M-MuLV(myc)-induced tumors were Thy 1.2-, but they were positive for Ly-5 (B220) and also for MAC-2. The Thy 1.2- tumors were characteristically located in the thymus. However, they were negative for TCR beta gene rearrangements. Some, but not all, of the Thy 1.2- tumors contained rearrangements for Ig genes. Additionally, they typically expressed mRNA specific for B but not for T cells. Thus, these thymic tumors had characteristics of the B cell lineage. Tumor transplantation experiments demonstrated that the Thy 1.2- tumor cells could reestablish in the thymus and spleen of irradiated hosts, and low level expression of the Thy 1 molecule was observed in the thymus but not the spleen on the first passage. After serial passage, one Thy 1- tumor altered its cell surface phenotype to Thy 1low B220-.\r"

  ".U": "89009832\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that anti-H-43a CTL response of H-43b responder mice was exclusively restricted by self H-2Kb (Kb) but not by the other nine self MHC class I alleles from independent origins, i.e., Kbml,d,k,s and Db,d,k,q,s. In the present study, we verified that Kf,q,r and Df,r alleles could also not serve as restricting class I elements in the CTL response to H-43a alloantigen. Another notable observation made in the earlier study was the fact that, in H-43 incompatibility of the alternative combination, H-43a mice were incapable of generating CTL activity against H-43b alloantigen. However, by means of employing new in vivo immunization procedures, we discovered that some but not all genetically identical H-43a responder mice could mount anti-H-43b CTL response restricted by self Kb. Again, no anti-H-43b CTL activity could be generated in the context of self Kk, Kj, Db or Dk molecules. Although the number of class I alleles we examined is still limited, these results indicate that antigenic fragments derived from the processed H-43a and H-43b alloantigens possess an indistinguishable epitope (agretope), and that such agretope either interacts only with the privileged Kb molecules or allows to bestow the immunogenic conformation of allodeterminants on the fragments solely in the context of the restricting Kb element.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of the immune response of C57BL/6 mice to the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl (NP) hapten determined that challenge with antigenic forms of hapten induces both immunity and suppression. The anti-NP plaque-forming cell response can be down regulated by an Ag-induced cascade consisting of three suppressor T cell subsets. These three populations, termed Ts1, Ts2, and Ts3 have been characterized to have inducer, transducer and effector functions, respectively. Although the functions of each of these subsets have been examined in vivo, the cellular requirements for in vitro Ts induction have only been investigated for the Ts3 population. The present study characterizes the cellular events that lead to the induction of the Ts2, suppressor transducer population. Culture of naive C57BL/6 spleen cells with Ts1-derived suppressor factor in the absence of exogenous Ag leads to the generation of Ts2 cells that mediate Ag-specific suppression of NP plaque-forming cell responses. Phenotypic analyses demonstrate that a CD3+, CD4-, CD5+, CD8+, and I-J+ precursor population is stimulated by TsF1 to become mature Ts2 cells that express CD3, CD8, and I-J but not CD5. Although previous studies have reported an essential role for B cells in the induction of other Ts populations, depletion of B cells from Ts2 induction cultures had no effect on Ts2 generation. Despite the absence of B cells in these cultures, the mature Ts2 cells were functionally IgH restricted. Studies with IgH congenic B.C-8 mice suggest that this restriction specificity was imposed by the idiotype-related determinants expressed on the TsF1, not the T cell genotype.\r"

IFN-gamma increased class I expression, but the cells remained insensitive to CTL. Susceptibility to nonrestricted effectors was preserved. Class I+ glioma cell lines behaved similarly. The CTL resistance was localized to the recognition phase. Neuroblastoma lines did not form conjugates with primed T cells, but were lysed if they were coupled to the effectors via lectins. The levels of class I expression, and resistance to CTL, were constant over a range of IFN doses. HLA-A,B,C structure and distribution were studied more intensively on one cell line, CHP-100. HLA-A2 and -A3 were present on greater than or equal to 99% of the cells, in a unimodal distribution. After IFN treatment, the levels were similar to B cell controls. In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the molecules co-migrated with those of B cell controls. The defect may thus be in accessory proteins that are necessary for T cell recognition or binding, rather than in the structure or distribution of the HLA-A,B,C proteins.\r"

SDS-PAGE analysis of gradient fractions showed that high Mr degradation fragments of the endocytosed antibody were formed in the low density vesicles before terminal degradation could be recorded. The partial degradation of the antibody was not blocked by low temperature or enzyme inhibitors, such as leupeptin and benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanylalanine-diazomyethyl-ketone, all of which severely retarded terminal degradation. The data also suggested that the recycling of partially degraded antibody to the cell surface employed a pool of such low density prelysosomal vesicles.\r"

Cloned T lymphocytes injected intravenously protected nonimmune mice against L. monocytogenes challenge as determined by spleen and liver bacterial numbers. Supernatants, produced by stimulating clones with heat-killed Listeria for 48 h, also afforded protection against L. monocytogenes. The clonal supernatants contained significant quantities of IFN-gamma and CSF. IFN-gamma production was Ag specific and occurred within 24 h of stimulation. CSF production by clones was increased four- to sixfold over baseline as determined by a bone marrow colony-forming assay and was Ag specific. When the IFN-gamma in supernatants was neutralized with a specific mAb, protection afforded by the supernatants was lost. These data indicate that one mechanism for Ag-specific, T lymphocyte-mediated protection against L. monocytogenes is the release of IFN-gamma.\r"

A mean of 93% of the 15-lipoxygenase activity in sonicates of cultured keratinocytes was recovered in the 400,000 X g supernatant, attesting to the cytosolic localization of this enzyme. Optimal 15-lipoxygenase activity in the 400,000 X g supernatant was expressed at pH 6.7-7.3 and in the presence of calcium at a concentration of 2 mM or higher. Keratinocyte 15-lipoxygenase metabolized arachidonic acid (Km = 10.6 microM) and linoleic acid (Km = 9.5 microM) with similar efficiency. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid both inhibited the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-HETE with respective 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.0 microM and 0.9 microM, while ATP, GTP, and cyclic AMP had no effect on activity at pH 6.8-7.2. The enzymatic properties of human keratinocyte 15-lipoxygenase thus resemble those of PMN leukocyte 15-lipoxygenase and the mediators generated may contribute to the regulation of cutaneous sensation and inflammation.\r"

The first application produced erythema, extravasation of plasma proteins resulting in an increase in ear weight, and some neutrophil accumulation (detected histologically and quantified by myeloperoxidase content). The second application produced minimal edema but did cause erythema and a greater accumulation of neutrophils. Subsequent daily application caused erythema, neutrophil accumulation, and an increase in ear weight predominantly due to cell proliferation (epidermis and connective tissue). Daily applications of other unsaturated fatty acids did not match the response induced by arachidonic acid. Mast cell deficient mice (W/Wv) exhibited a smaller edema response to the first dose of arachidonic acid compared to either their wild-type controls or CD-1 mice. In addition, W/Wv mice exhibited a smaller ear weight increase and myeloperoxidase accumulation following eight daily doses of arachidonic acid. However, epidermal proliferation was similar in all the strains of mice tested. These data suggest that the edema caused by the first topical application of arachidonic acid is partly mast cell mediated. Mast cells also appear to be involved in the neutrophil infiltration induced by multiple topical applications, but not in the epidermal proliferation.\r"

Following metabolic labeling with [35S]-sulfate and [3H]-glucosamine under steady state conditions in \"high\" medium calcium (greater than 1.0 mMol), the majority of sulfated glycosaminoglycans remained associated with the cell layers, whereas hyaluronic acid, which was present in smaller amounts than the sulfated products, was about equally distributed between the medium and the cell layers. Of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate and chondroitin 4/6-sulfate were the major species and were present in roughly comparable amounts, whereas dermatan sulfate was quantitatively the lesser of the products. The effects of \"low\" medium calcium (0.3 and 0.025 mM) were complex, although a consistent decrease in the incorporation of the [3H]-glucosamine precursor was found at high cell density, probably reflecting a decrease in its intracellular specific activity. In \"high\" calcium cultures, there was a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.92) between keratinocyte cell number and cellular production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, whereas no such relationship was evident in cultures grown in \"low\" calcium medium at comparable cell density. Because keratinocyte differentiation is inhibited in the low calcium conditions, the results suggest that the decrease in production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by confluent keratinocytes may actually correlate with differentiation rather than with cell number.\r"

In order to elucidate the origin of 5-S-CD, we have now systematically studied the relationship between the 5-S-CD excretion in urine and the size of the melanocyte organ, UV-induced melanocyte proliferation, skin type, and the erythemal reaction. The skin type had no influence on the basal excretion of 5-S-CD. There was no significant correlation between the basal 5-S-CD excretion and the size of the melanocyte organ; that is, the number of skin melanocytes and nevi. During the irradiation, subjects with skin type II developed a more pronounced erythema (p less than 0.01) and had a significantly higher 5-S-CD excretion than those with skin type III-IV (p less than 0.01). No correlation was found between 5-S-CD excretion and UV-induced melanocyte proliferation. The lack of correlation between the basal 5-S-CD excretion and skin type or number of melanocytes suggests that the basal 5-S-CD in urine is mainly of extra-melanocytic origin. Our findings favor the view that the increase in 5-S-CD excretion during UV irradiation is due to UV damage.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid diagnostic tests for tuberculous meningitis are urgently needed because delayed treatment increases the already high mortality rate of this disease. Direct acid-fast staining of cerebrospinal fluid is the only quick method generally available, but it lacks sensitivity. Therefore, we evaluated the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to mycobacterial antigen and antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid of 29 patients with proven tuberculous meningitis, 83 patients with nontuberculous central nervous system infections, and 15 normal controls. The specificity of the test was 96%; the four false-positive results all occurred in patients with bacterial meningitis. Fifteen (52%) of 29 patients with tuberculous meningitis had either a positive antigen or antibody ELISA test, which was significantly more than the number of patients testing positive by direct staining (two of 29 positive; P less than .01). We therefore recommend using an ELISA to detect antigen and antibody but caution that because of limited sensitivity a negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.\r"

Volunteers received 25 micrograms each of protein and polysaccharide administered intramuscularly either in 0.9% NaCl or adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide on weeks 0 and 6. Most individuals experienced mild local reactions, but there were no systemic reactions. Both vaccine formulations stimulated antibodies to the outer membrane proteins of serotypes 2a:P1.2 and 2b:P1.2, but higher levels were achieved with the aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed vaccine after two immunizations. Vaccine-induced antibodies were primarily IgG and were bactericidal for both a serotype 2a and a serotype 2b strain. Induction of bactericidal antibodies has been shown to be a major predictor of protection against meningococcal disease.\r"

OMPs were isolated from broth culture supernatants. Typical of other gram-negative bacteria, eight proteins ranging in molecular weight (MW) from approximately 98,000 to 21,000 daltons were revealed by SDS-PAGE; these proteins were designated OMP A-OMP H. Of the OMPs identified, four were heat modifiable (C, D, E, and H). The 50 strains were obtained from diverse geographic and clinical sources. The OMP patterns were strikingly homogeneous; there was minimal variability in the MW of OMPs between strains. Future studies should establish whether the similarity in MWs of OMPs is paralleled by their antigenic characteristics.\r"

With mixed Escherichia coli-B. fragilis clots, t-PA increased the mortality rate from the control level of 43.8% to 81.3% but prevented abscesses in survivors. This increased mortality rate was probably due to an acute E. coli bacteremia. Antibiotics plus t-PA prevented both mortality and abscess formation. Intraperitoneal fibrinolysis may be a useful adjunct to antibiotics and appropriate surgery in the management of intra-abdominal infection.\r"

With use of numerous multiple-dosing regimens in an animal model, this study is the first to successfully minimize the interdependence between pharmacokinetic parameters and thereby determine, by stepwise multivariate regression analysis, that the time that serum levels exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was the most significant parameter determining efficacy for beta-lactams and erythromycin against various pathogens, whereas the log area under the curve was the major parameter for aminoglycosides. Optimal dosing intervals were no greater than the time that serum levels exceeded the MIC plus the duration of the postantibiotic effect. Careful application of these concepts should allow other investigators to use more optimally dosed regimens than those previously used in preclinical trials and to design studies to improve on current dosing regimens for humans.\r"

Two groups were defined based upon the stimulation protocol: Group A1 was stimulated with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), and Group A2 with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and hMG. They were compared to two randomized control groups of patients who received the same induction but were classically monitored. There was a high proportion of spontaneous ovulations in the programmed group (8/42) compared to the nonprogrammed group (0/42). There was a nonsignificant difference in the number of oocytes obtained or embryos replaced per cycle. Four pregnancies were obtained in the programmed group (24% per transfer), against 10 in the nonprogrammed patients (32% per transfer). The results of this method seem to be better using FSH for ovulation stimulation and a verification of the serum estradiol on the day of induction with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the following day (semiprogrammed method).\r"

Desmopressin acetate did not induce any significant change in ACE, in contrast to the effect of venostasis. Searching for an endothelial abnormality implicated in the genesis of deep vein thrombosis, we used the local venostasis test in patients affected by recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Patients, divided in three groups (group I, documented history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis; group II, only one deep vein thrombosis or recurrent superficial venous thrombosis; group III, history of arterial thromboembolism), and controls were screened for basal and stimulated levels of serum ACE, together with fibrinolytic activity and von Willebrand factor level. Two types of abnormalities of serum ACE activity were found: low basal level in group I, and low response to venostasis in groups I and III; group II did not differ from controls. Measures of fibrinolytic and ACE activities are not redundant because the two types of ACE abnormalities were not individually encountered in the same patients and were independent from abnormalities of the fibrinolytic system. These findings suggest that an endothelial lesion could participate in the pathogenesis of some forms of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and support interest in the measurement of serum ACE to discriminate some patients at high risk of deep vein thrombosis.\r"

The infection rate was significantly lower in wounds closed with PDS and Prolene (chi 2 = 6.05, p less than .05), and in tympanoplasty operations (chi 2 = 4.42, p less than .05). Four patients suffered wound dehiscence, all four had been closed with catgut and silk. No other complication of wound healing was noted in the trial. In conclusion, PDS and Prolene are superior suture materials to catgut and silk in the closure of aural wounds.\r"

At the request of the Cameroonian Government, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the U.S. Department of State sent a multidisciplinary team which included 2 forensic pathologists to assist the Government of Cameroon in investigating this natural disaster. The medical evaluation was concentrated in 3 areas: the autopsy of human and animal fatalities, examination and interview of survivors, and examination of the scene of the disaster. Toxicologic specimens were obtained at autopsy, and numerous samples of lake water were collected. The autopsy findings were consistent with asphyxia. The results of chemical analyses excluded many volatiles but not carbon dioxide as the toxic agent. The exact source of this gas continues to be a subject of a heated geologic debate, but fermentation of organic materials in the lake water has been eliminated on the basis of C14 isotope studies. This investigation underlines the value of forensic pathologists in epidemiological studies and in the examination of living persons.\r"

This problem is illustrated in a case of progressive dementia with parkinsonian features. Lewy bodies were found, not only in the pigmented nuclei in the brainstem and in the cerebral cortex, but also in the dentate fascia, a predilection site for Pick bodies. The inclusion bodies were compared with the inclusion bodies in a case of Pick's disease. Intense argyrophilia of the cortical inclusion bodies argued in favor of Pick bodies; antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments reacted with the cortical inclusions and with classical Pick bodies, but antibodies to paired helical filaments reacted only with the Pick bodies. The most convincing evidence, that the inclusions were Lewy bodies, was obtained by electron microscopy. The filaments in the inclusions showed fuzzy deposits of electron dense material, characteristic for filaments of Lewy bodies. This contrasted with the smooth filaments of the Pick bodies. It is concluded that cortical inclusions in brains from patients with Lewy bodies in the pigmented nuclei of the brainstem most likely represent Lewy bodies. This can be confirmed by examining the ultrastructure of the inclusions.\r"

  ".W": "Transsected rat soleus muscles incubated in oxygenated Krebs solution in vitro at 37 degrees C develop prominent vacuolation in the vicinity of the cut ends of muscle fibers which extends further along the fiber with increasing time of incubation. Electron microscopy shows that the vacuoles represent dilated segments of T-tubules. Their formation is prevented if the muscle is not cut, or in the following situations: omission of Na+ from the medium, incubation at 10 degrees C, or in media containing either 2,4-dinitrophenol or ouabain. Vacuole formation is considerably reduced by substituting Cl- with organic anions or by adding 9-anthracene carboxylic acid to the medium. These results suggest that a massive influx of sodium into the muscle fibers through their cut ends results in maximal stimulation of the Na+-K+-ATPase of the T-tubular membrane leading to increasing Na+ concentration in the lumen of T-tubules followed by influx of Cl- to maintain the electrical gradient. The accumulation of these ions leads to the entry of water from either the extracellular space or the sarcoplasm and consequent dilatation of T-tubules. Rapid incorporation of lipids into T-tubular membrane to increase its surface is presumably necessary for this to occur. Similar T-tubular dilatation appears to occur in vivo in surviving portions of muscle fibers adjacent to segmental necrosis.\r"

This study was undertaken to define immunocytochemically the cytoskeletal constituents of the filamentous cytopathologic marker of idiopathic Parkinson disease, the Lewy body (LB). An array of antibodies specific to neurofilaments, tubulin, microtubule associated proteins (tau, MAP1 and MAP2) and Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were used to immunostain sections containing LB. All the antibodies to tubulin, MAP1 and MAP2 and the majority of the antibodies to neurofilaments and NFT recognized LB. The two monoclonal antibodies to NFT that recognize LB also react with ubiquitin, which has been identified in NFT. The prominent NFT component, tau, is apparently not incorporated into LB. These findings suggest that the presence of tau might not be a prerequisite to the formation of abnormal filaments. Therefore, although LB contain elements of neurofilaments, microtubules and ubiquitin, as do other abnormal neuronal filaments, they are distinct in composition. These distinctive and shared features may provide useful insights regarding the mechanisms underlying the formation of filaments in LB as well as those of other neuronal inclusions.\r"

A survival benefit of 1.6 months in favor of alternating chemotherapy was associated with an additional cost of $450 (1984 Canadian dollars) per patient. This translated to a cost of $3,370 per year of life gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness (CEA) of alternating chemotherapy was greatest when treatment was given on an outpatient basis. The results of the evaluation were sensitive to hospitalization rates, but even the most unfavorable analyses revealed the CEA of alternating chemotherapy to be comparable to that of treatments of common nonmalignant diseases. It is concluded that the CEA of alternating chemotherapy for SCLC was favorable when compared with accepted treatments for nonmalignant diseases. The survival benefit seen with alternating chemotherapy was felt to be clinically significant and alternating chemotherapy is recommended as routine therapy for extensive SCLC.\r"

Images were obtained from the pelvis to the base of the skull on Days 1, 4, and 7 after tracer injection. The 15 patients with histopathologic confirmation of adrenal medullary disease had positive scans. In three of these, the pheos were visible only on images obtained on Day 7. One scan was false negative. After excluding patients with a predisposition to adrenal medullary disease, nine subjects (28%) without verification of pheo displayed adrenal uptake of the radionuclide. Late images produce a low rate of false-negative scans; the background activity diminishes and even small pheos can be detected. In order to increase the quality of late images, 40 MBq [131I]MIBG was used instead of 20 MBq. The dosimetric considerations are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnoses of 431 general internal medicine patients from an urban outpatient department (OPD) were analyzed using two methods of case mix description: 1) a visit-based method which captures a single diagnosis for each visit; 2) a patient-based method which captures multiple diagnoses for a patient over one year. Nine of the top ten diagnoses were the same using either method, but the prevalence of diagnoses was two- to twelvefold higher with the patient-based method. Next the OPD was compared by the visit-based method with a national survey of doctors' private offices. Although the visit-based case mix in the OPD appeared to be the same as that in doctors' private offices, the analysis suggested that differences may be hidden by the method of describing case mix. The authors conclude that a visit-based approach to case mix description makes urban OPDs resemble doctors' private offices because the visit-based method undercounts those patients with chronic diagnoses, co-morbid conditions, and psychosocial problems, so common in the urban OPD. These findings have major implications for ambulatory reimbursement schemes, most of which capture only one diagnosis for each visit.\r"

The mean rates of both weight gain and nitrogen retention in group 1 were somewhat greater than intrauterine rates; plasma concentrations of transthyretin and albumin also were acceptable. Thus the lower protein intake appeared to be adequate. On the other hand, the rates of weight gain and nitrogen retention in groups 2 and 3 were greater than those in group 1, supporting the efficacy of the higher protein intake with respect to growth. However, blood urea nitrogen and plasma amino acid concentrations also were higher in groups 2 and 3; both were higher in group 2 than in group 3, reflecting the positive effect of the higher energy intake on protein utilization. This observation, combined with data from an earlier study, indicates that protein intakes in excess of 3 gm/100 kcal will not be utilized completely. Energy expenditure in group 3 was greater than in group 1 but not group 2, raising the possibility that protein intakes not utilized completely contribute to diet-induced thermogenesis. The higher energy intake in group 3 vs group 2 did not affect rate of weight gain significantly, but energy storage in group 3, and hence fat accretion, was greater than that of other groups. In all groups the ratio of protein accretion to fat accretion reflected dietary proportions of protein and energy.\r"

Its investigational use in the United States has been limited to the treatment of men with occupational plumbism. Twenty-one children with blood lead concentrations of 31 to 49 micrograms/dl, who also had a positive calcium disodium edetate (CaNa2EDTA) mobilization test result, were hospitalized for 7 days. Fifteen children were randomly assigned to three groups that received either 350, 700, or 1050 mg/m2/day, respectively, of DMSA in three divided doses daily. A fourth group of six children received conventional treatment with 1000 mg/m2/day of intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA in two divided doses daily. The 1050 mg/m2/day dose of DMSA was significantly more effective than lower doses of DMSA or intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA in reducing blood lead levels and restoring erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity. Intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA significantly increased the urinary excretion of several essential minerals (zinc, copper, iron, and calcium), whereas DMSA did not. The DMSA was well tolerated and appears extremely promising as a drug that will simplify the management of childhood lead poisoning.\r"

MOR infusion at a rate of 3 mg.hr-1 did not affect fetal survival or the response of fetal breathing movements to hypercapnia. Chronic exposure to MOR increased the height of the integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram signal (IDIA), respiratory drive and inspiratory effort during periods of eucapnia. Respiratory drive was determined by the product of IDIA height and breathing frequency, and inspiratory effort was the quotient of IDIA height divided by inspiratory time. These effects may be related to accumulation of morphine-3-beta-D-glucuronide. Higher doses of MOR, 10 (n = 3) and 30 (n = 1) mg.hr-1, caused seizures and decreased fetal survival.\r"

[3H]Mianserin binding to a crude membrane preparation of choroid plexus from rat brain was rapid, saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 1 nM). The density of sites labeled by [3H]mianserin and [3H]mesulergine was equal. Furthermore, an excellent correlation was found between the potencies of drugs in competing for [3H]mianserin binding and for [125]lysergic acid diethylamide binding. Based on these data, it was concluded that [3H]mianserin labels the 5-HT-1c binding site. Using this ligand, the binding of the putative selective 5-HT-2 antagonist ritanserin to the 5-HT-1c site was evaluated. Ritanserin was a potent inhibitor of [3H]mianserin binding with a Ki value of 0.2 nM. Functional studies of 5-HT-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, the transmembrane signaling pathway for the 5-HT-1c receptor, showed that ritanserin blocks the effect of 5-HT and that it functions as a competitive antagonist of the 5-HT-1c receptor in intact choroid plexus. The potencies of ritanserin and several other drugs, including other 5-HT-2 antagonists, at the 5-HT-1c binding site correlated with their potencies at blocking 5-HT-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This dose of xylamine resulted in a 40 to 50% selective decrease in cortical levels of NE and the major metabolites of NE, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and, when measured after 35 days, [3H]desipramine binding and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity were at control levels, which would indicate that the NE nerve terminals in the cortex were intact. The 21- or 35-day deficit of NE did not affect alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, dopamine2, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acidB receptor densities, or the beta receptor mediated adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, desipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.) administration for 14 days (days 20 through 34) was able to down-regulate beta receptor number (16% decrease) and reduce NE-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (22% decrease), indicating that postsynaptic plasticity was still maintained. Affective disorders do not appear to be associated with a substantial (or readily measurable) decrease in brain NE concentrations and there is no consistent evidence of an altered beta receptor responsiveness. Thus, partial depletion of NE with xylamine might represent a biochemical model reflecting the involvement of NE in depression which could be used to investigate more sensitive markers of altered noradrenergic function.\r"

Membranes prepared from PDBu-treated bovine aorta exhibited a 16% reduction in [3H]prazosin binding capacity, whereas [3H]prazosin affinity was unchanged. This may reflect a role for protein kinase C-mediated receptor phosphorylation in determining receptor turnover and surface density. After PDBu treatment, the affinity of epinephrine for [3H]prazosin sites was altered in two respects. Control membranes exhibited both high and low affinity epinephrine binding (KDH, 20 nM; KDL, 1086 nM) whereas, PDBu-treated membranes exhibited only a single class of low affinity sites (KDL, 655 nM). The inclusion of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate caused the loss of high affinity sites in control membranes but had no effect on PDBu-treated membranes (KDL, 681 nM). Thus, protein kinase C blocks the ability of the agonist-receptor complex to couple to a GTP binding regulatory protein. In binding studies conducted at 2 degrees C epinephrine also bound to high (KDH, 34 nM) and low affinity (KDL, 1920 nM) sites although the percentage of high affinity sites was higher (percentage of RH, 80) than at 25 degrees C (percentage of RH, 19). PDBu-treated membranes also exhibited two agonist affinity states in 2 degrees C studies although affinity was slightly reduced (KDH, 74 nM; KDL, 2405 nM). 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate was without effect at 2 degrees C. These results indicate that a high affinity agonist binding state can still be achieved after PDBu treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory effect of isoproterenol was examined on the release of histamine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from human lung mast cells. Isoproterenol was more potent in inhibiting anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E-induced LTC4 and PGD2 release than histamine release from the dispersed lung cell preparations (2-5% mast cells). The negative log molar EC50 values of isoproterenol for inhibiting histamine, LTC4 and PGD2 release were 8.2 +/- 0.2, 8.9 +/- 0.2 and 8.7 +/- 0.3, respectively (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 8). Isoproterenol seldom inhibited histamine release by more than 60%, but usually abolished the release of LTC4 and PGD2. The potency of propranolol (KB = 6 X 10(-10) M) was the same for competitively antagonizing isoproterenol mediated inhibition of histamine, LTC4 or PGD2 release. Using the irreversible beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, bromoacetylalprenololmenthane, the estimated dissociation constant of isoproterenol was 2 X 10(-7) M irrespective of whether inhibition of anti-IgE-induced histamine or LTC4 release was examined. When the divalent cation ionophore A23187 was used to induce histamine release, isoproterenol had either no effect or potentiated the release. In contrast, isoproterenol was capable of virtually abolishing A23187-induced LTC4 release. Qualitatively similar effects of isoproterenol were observed on purified mast cell preparations (greater than 80% mast cells); however, the potency of isoproterenol in inhibiting mediator release from these preparations was reduced. The results demonstrate that there is a substantial receptor reserve for isoproterenol-mediated inhibition of histamine, LTC4 and PGD2 release from the human lung mast cell. The intrinsic efficacy of isoproterenol in inhibiting anti-IgE-induced release of arachidonic acid metabolites is approximately 3 times greater than that for inhibiting histamine release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In four experiments with purified basophils the phenothiazine derivative, L651-392, proved to be an effective inhibitor of leukotriene (LT) C4 release in the range 1-10 microM (P less than .005) although the release of histamine was unaffected by the highest doses of the drug. The release of 5-hydroxyeico-satetraenoic acid (5-HETE) from purified basophils (n = 2) was also reduced from 8.6 ng/10(6) basophils to below the limit of detection (1.2 ng/10(6) basophils). Intermediate concentrations of L651-392 (0.5 microM) reduced both the rate at which LTC4 was produced and the final concentration. The release of LTC4 was complete within 20-30 min and was unaffected by increased incubation periods (up to 90 min). HPLC analysis revealed that the drug was not promoting the metabolism of LTC4 to LTD4 or LTE4. Basophils (average purity = 78 +/- 3, n = 3) labeled with 3H-arachidonic acid (AA) were challenged with anti-IgE (0.1 microgram/ml) and the lipid mediators analyzed by HPLC. Control cells released 3H-LTC4, 3H-HETE, unmetabolized 3H-AA, and an unidentified metabolite, whereas those pretreated with L651-392 released only 3H-AA and the unknown metabolite with no detectable 3H-LTC4 or 3H-HETE.

Adding norepinephrine (NE) under these conditions resulted in a transient response which was attributed to Ca++ release from a limited cellular store. Subsequent addition of Ca++ results in a sustained contraction that was dependent upon the concentration of agonist and Ca++. This maintained response which by definition was insensitive to D600 was attributed to RLCa++E, was extensively relaxed or inhibited by nitroprusside or nitroglycerin and was partially relaxed by KCl or tetraethylammonium. Contractions due to RLCa++E alone equaled or exceeded the peak tension attained solely as a result of Ca++ release. At higher NE concentrations (greater than 10(-7) M), RLCa++E provided sufficient Ca++ to attain and sustain maximal levels of developed tension without requiring any additional Ca++ from either PDCa++E or Ca++ release. This high flux capacity of these receptor-linked Ca++ channels may partially account for the relative insensitivity of contractile responses to these higher concentrations of NE to D600. The relative contribution of PDCa++E to the elevation of myoplasmic Ca++ and concurrent sensitivity to D600 was increased at lower concentrations of NE because the degree of Ca++ release and RLCa++E were relatively small. Additionally, it appears that RLCA++E may be attenuated by concomitant membrane depolarization.\r"

Drug infusion to fetus achieved higher fetal plasma drug levels (approximately 448 ng/ml) and resulted in a transient decline in arterial Po2 and pH, associated with transient tachycardia and vigorous breathing movements during the initial portion of the infusion. There was also a significant fall in the amount of low voltage ECoG pattern (51-26%) and marked increases in the amount of intermediate voltage pattern (8-46%), and an increase in the occurrence of rapid eye movements during this intermediate voltage pattern (8-63%).

  ".W": "LY 83583 (6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione) has been reported to lower intracellular cyclic GMP by an unknown mechanism. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of LY 83583 on different types of vasorelaxation and to study its mechanism of action. Low concentrations of LY 83583 (less than or equal to 0.1 microM) inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations of rabbit aortic strips induced by acetylcholine or by the calcium ionophore A23187. Higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 0.3 microM) were required to produce partial inhibition of relaxation to sodium nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate. Cyclic AMP-mediated relaxations, induced by isoprenaline or forskolin, were not affected by LY 83583 (10 microM). The site of interference of LY 83583 with endothelium-dependent relaxation was examined with endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) released from cultured endothelial cells that were grown on microcarrier beads and stimulated by superfusion with ATP or thimerosal. EDRF in the superfusate was detected by endothelium-denuded segments of rabbit femoral artery, which responded with dilation and, simultaneously, by purified soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) in test tubes, which was activated by EDRF. When LY 83583 was added to the glutathione-containing GC-assay or to the superfusate from cultured endothelial cells, it did not affect stimulation of soluble GC by EDRF but it slowly reversed the dilator response of the arterial detector segment. Superfusion of cultured endothelial cells with LY 83583 (1 microM), rapidly and reversibly inhibited EDRF release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Release of norepinephrine (NE) and ATP from the guinea pig vas deferens evoked by ouabain in combination with monensin or by high KCl was measured by a high-pressure liquid chromatography-ECD and luciferin-luciferase assay, respectively. Ouabain (10-100 microM) induced a concentration-dependent liberation of NE, which was enhanced by 10 microM monensin, a Na+-ionophore. The marked NE release elicited by the combined administration of both the drugs was unaffected by Ca++-removal but was reduced by lowering Na+ from the medium. This NE release in the Ca++-free medium was diminished markedly after treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine or reserpine and in low-temperature (25 degrees C) medium. This release was also decreased by ruthenium red (10-30 microM), an uptake inhibitor of Ca++ to mitochondria, and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (10 microM), a metabolic inhibitor. On the other hand, 100 mM KCl caused a moderate, extracellular Ca++-dependent release of NE. ATP-outflow from the tissue evoked by 100 microM ouabain plus 10 microM monensin was almost unaltered by Ca++-removal but was inhibited by 6-hydroxydopamine or prazosin (0.3 microM), whereas release induced by high KCl was reduced by 6-hydroxydopamine and Ca++-free medium but was unaffected by prazosin. ATP/NE ratios at respective maximum effluxes evoked by 100 mM KCl and ouabain plus monensin were 6.59 and 0.22, respectively. These findings suggest that there may be more than one site of corelease for NE and ATP. Ouabain plus monensin seems to produce an extracellular Ca++-independent neuronal release of NE and ATP from the cytoplasmic and vesicular storage sites which predominantly release NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89011475\r", 
  ".W": "Over 60% of the analgesic/antipyretic drug acetaminophen is eliminated by glucuronidation, which competes with a toxifying pathway involving cytochromes P-450-catalyzed bioactivation to a hepatotoxic reactive intermediate. A genetic deficiency of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyl transferase (GT) occurs in 5 to 7% of the population (Gilbert's disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome) and this could predispose such people to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. This hypothesis was evaluated in the homozygous Gunn rat, which is similarly deficient in GT, and the heterozygous Gunn rat, which has intermediary GT activity. Acetaminophen, 1 g/kg, was administered by gavage to animals 6 and 11 weeks of age, and age-matched Wistar rats as controls. Hepatic and renal cellular damage were assessed by respective increases in the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase and the blood urea nitrogen concentration, and confirmed by histological examination. Acetaminophen and metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to Wistar controls, Gunn rats demonstrated up to a 110-fold greater hepatotoxic response to acetaminophen, with significantly lower production of the glucuronide conjugate and higher plasma concentrations of acetaminophen. Elevated acetaminophen concentrations correlated positively with both increased production of the acetaminophen-cysteine conjugate, reflecting bioactivation and hepatotoxicity. Older Gunn but not Wistar rats showed up to 26-fold more hepatotoxicity compared to their younger counterparts. In younger animals, heterozygotes demonstrated intermediary hepatotoxicity between homozygotes and Wistar controls. Hepatotoxicity was similar in the older heterozygotic and homozygotic Gunn rats, as was renal toxicity, which was enhanced 2- to 3-fold over controls. These results indicate that a genetic deficiency in bilirubin GT can be an important determinant of acetaminophen bioactivation and toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular mechanisms of somatostatin (SRIF) desensitization were investigated in the anterior pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20. Previous studies have shown that pretreatment of AtT-20 cells with SRIF analogs desensitizes the cells to SRIF inhibition of hormone release, cyclic AMP formation and calcium influx. This desensitization may involve a change in the properties of the SRIF receptors. Pretreatment of AtT-20 cells with Trp8-SRIF reduced the binding of the SRIF analog [125I]CGP 23996 (des-Alal, Gly2-[desamino-Cys3, Tyr11]-3, 14-dicarbasomatostatin) to AtT-20 cell membranes. The loss of [125I]CGP 23996 binding was dependent on the time of Trp8-SRIF treatment and was reversible. The ability of GTP analogs to inhibit [125I]CGP 23996 binding was reduced after Trp8-SRIF treatment, suggesting that the SRIF receptor and the inhibitory G proteins become uncoupled during desensitization. This is indicated further by the decrease in SRIF stimulation of GTPase activity and SRIF inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in desensitized membranes. The reduction and recovery of SRIF inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity after Trp8-SRIF pretreatment has a similar time course as the changes in [125I]CGP 23996 binding. GTP inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is also reduced in SRIF-desensitized membranes. The loss of the GTP effect occurs rapidly and does not fully recover after Trp8-SRIF pretreatment. The levels of ADP-ribosylation of inhibitory GTP binding protein, the relative quantity of the alpha subunits of the inhibitory G proteins and their electrophoretic mobility after 2-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis, are not altered in SRIF-desensitized membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Statistically significant amounts of arachidonic acid metabolites migrated with prostaglandins (PGs) E (81 +/- 14 fmol) and F (68 +/- 13 fmol) and thromboxane B (49 +/- 12 fmol) on thin-layer chromatography plates after incubation of differentiated cells with 1 pmol of [3H]arachidonic acid. The conversion of arachidonic acid to these products was lower in undifferentiated cells, although PGE- and PGF-like metabolites were produced in significant amounts. Both immunoreactive PGE and thromboxane B were detected in the media of differentiated cells and their concentrations were elevated when the cells were exposed to arachidonic acid. The potential significance of the thromboxane production by pheochromocytoma-12 cells was investigated by examining the effect of a stable thromboxane mimetic, U46619, on potassium-stimulated norepinephrine release. The U46619 significantly enhanced norepinephrine release from potassium-depolarized cells. These results are indicative of PGE, PGF and thromboxane production by isolated adrenergic neuronal tissue. A thromboxane receptor agonist also was observed to potentiate norepinephrine release.\r"

  ".U": "89011490\r", 
  ".W": "Similar to other amphetamine analogs 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\"), a currently popular illicit drug, has been characterized recently as a serotonergic neurotoxin due to its ability to cause long-lasting deficits in markers of central serotonergic function in animals. Because the serotonergic toxicity associated with the MDMA analog methamphetamine has been linked previously to endogenous dopamine and because MDMA, like methamphetamine, elicits pronounced dopamine release in vitro, we have examined the role of endogenous dopamine in both the immediate (3 hr) and longer-term (3 days) central serotonergic deficits induced by systemic MDMA administration to rats. Depletion of central dopamine content with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or reserpine, or selective destruction of nigrostriatal dopamine projections with bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced substantia nigral lesions, partially blocked the immediate MDMA-induced reduction in rat striatal tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity. In addition, the longer-term TPH deficits caused by a high single dose of MDMA were completely prevented by prior alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or reserpine, and attenuated significantly by inhibition of dopamine uptake with the selective dopamine-uptake blocker GBR 12909. These results implicate endogenous drug-released dopamine as a partial mediator of the initial decrease in TPH activity caused by MDMA and as an important prerequisite to the development of long-term MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of dopamine-mediated toxicity are discussed.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive weekly intramuscular (IM) injections of either methotrexate 10 mg or GSTM 50 mg. Two patients taking methotrexate and 7 taking GSTM were withdrawn before 26 weeks. Methotrexate was as effective as GSTM as measured by numbers of swollen or tender joints, morning stiffness, grip strength, pain scale and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Five patients taking methotrexate and 11 taking GSTM presented side effects (p = 0.05). Total number of adverse reactions was 5 for the methotrexate group and 15 for the GSTM group (p less than 0.01).

Pretreatment of the different mononuclear cell populations necessary for the PFC response with GSTM for short periods (2-24 h) showed that both macrophages (M phi) and B lymphocytes were inhibited by the drug but that T cells were resistant. In the case of GSTM treated M phi the response was restored partially with exogenous interleukin-1, and completely with the addition of 20% fresh M phi. Our results show that the inhibition of polyclonal immunoglobulin secretion by human mononuclear cells in vitro is due to an effect of GSTM on both M phi and B lymphocytes.

When applied to CLS bound dsDNA, sera with antibodies to dsDNA and monoclonal antibody to DNA yielded mean OD values of greater than or equal to 0.6, significantly higher than those values obtained from control experiments (mean OD less than or equal to 0.2, p less than or equal to 0.003). (2) In a solid phase immunoassay radiolabelled DNA (3H DNA) was exposed to increasing amounts of solid phase adherent CLS. The binding of 3H DNA to the solid phase was substantially greater (more than a 30-fold increase) when the solid phase had been precoated with CLS. (3) dsDNA binding to CLS was demonstrated further by incubating electrophoretically resolved CLS with dsDNA and localizing the bound dsDNA by ethidium bromide staining. Our results indicate the dsDNA binds to CLS. Since CLS is the binding site for Clr and then Clr2Cls2, molecules which bind to CLS, such as dsDNA, could be important factors affecting Cl activation.\r"

  ".W": "Trimetrexate, an investigational antifol, has been associated with marked variability in drug tolerance among patients. The agent is extensively protein bound, and hepatic biotransformation plays a major role in its elimination. In early phase II testing, nine of 15 patients who experienced life-threatening or fatal toxic effects from trimetrexate had albumin levels less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL prior to treatment. This prompted a review of the data base on 272 patients entered in phase I clinical trails. The incidence of severe or life-threatening anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, and hepatic toxic effects during the first course of trimetrexate was analyzed according to dose, schedule, prior treatment, and baseline protein and albumin levels. The schedules using doses given by short infusions of 30-60 minutes daily for 5 days or weekly for 3 weeks were generally associated with higher incidence of toxic effects than the schedules using doses given every other week by short infusions or those using continuous infusion. The occurrence of leukopenia and mucositis was dose related. Patients with baseline albumin levels less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL had higher incidence of all types of severe or life-threatening toxic effects than those with albumin levels greater than or equal to 3.6 g/dL, and the differences were significant for the development of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis. Similar correlations were noted for pretreatment protein levels less than or equal to 6.0 g/dL. The small cohort of patients with leukemia experienced substantial toxic effects and tended to have low protein and albumin levels. Performance status and prior therapy did not emerge as strong predictors of severe toxic effects in the univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the type of cancer (leukemia vs. solid tumor), dose, schedule, and baseline albumin level were significant and independent predictors of severe and life-threatening toxic effects in the phase I patient population. Multivariate analysis including only patients with solid tumors indicated that albumin level, dose, and schedule remained significant predictors of toxic effects. Since normal liver function as reflected by bilirubin and transaminase values were a requirement for eligibility, the results suggest that albumin and protein levels may provide a more sensitive index of hepatic function. Patients with hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia are at increased risk of experiencing severe or life-threatening toxic effects from trimetrexate and should be treated cautiously.\r"

  ".W": "In four phase II trials of trimetrexate given iv daily for 5 days, we noted marked variability among patients in the development of severe or life-threatening toxic effects. In an effort to define which of 15 patient characteristics were associated with toxic effects of this degree, we have carried out single-factor and multifactor analyses on toxic effects during the first cycle of therapy in 68 patients. The final logistic regression model identified both low pretreatment serum protein levels and metastatic liver disease as significant correlates of severe toxic effects (P = .02 and P = .0005, respectively). While drug dose was an important element of the best logistic model, its statistical significance was only borderline. Trimetrexate is extensively protein bound and is cleared primarily by hepatic metabolism, so it is not unreasonable to believe that alteration in protein binding of the drug or in metabolic capacity of the liver could produce enhanced toxic effects. Although the validity of these predictors should be confirmed, it seems prudent to recommend lower starting doses of trimetrexate for patients with metastatic liver disease and/or low protein levels and dose escalation if toxic effects allow it.\r"

This tumor proteinase was purified by anion exchange chromatography, zinc-chelate Sepharose chromatography, and gel permeation chromatography. The final product was homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (relative molecular mass = 67,000). Gelatin zymography revealed two bands of gelatinolytic activity, corresponding to molecular weights of 67,000 and 62,000. Upon immunoblotting with the use of an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to a peptide region of type IV collagenase that lacks homology with interstitial collagenase or stromelysin, the purified tumor enzyme was identified as type IV collagenase.\r"

A prospective study was performed to determine rates of catheter contamination and CRS in multiple trauma and general surgical-medical patients who received TPN through TLC's and SLC's. Three hundred seven TLC's and 68 SLC's were placed in 234 patients during a 12-month period. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of contamination or CRS between the two groups although there was a trend toward increased CRS and contamination in the TLC group. TLC's may be used for short-term administration of TPN without significant increase in catheter contamination or CRS.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with posterior urethral valves may present with or contract renal insufficiency. High intravesical pressure that is transmitted to the upper urinary tract in utero is a likely contributing cause. We have identified 3 anatomical associations with posterior urethral valves that provide a pressure \"pop-off\" mechanism resulting in preservation of better renal function: 1) the syndrome of posterior urethral valves, unilateral vesicoureteral reflux and renal dysplasia; 2) large congenital type bladder diverticula and 3) urinary extravasation with or without urinary ascites. Followup of 71 boys with posterior urethral valves was sufficient to permit long-term analysis. Serum creatinine was used as an index of renal function and prognosis. Of the 71 boys 20 (28 per cent) had 1 of the 3 protective mechanisms. Only 1 child (5 per cent) had a serum creatinine greater than 1.0 mg. per cent. Of the remaining 51 boys without a \"pop-off\" mechanism 20 (39 per cent) had serum creatinine greater than 1.0 mg. per cent and 7 had already progressed to renal dialysis and/or transplantation. The difference in serum creatinine was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Thus, the syndrome of posterior urethral valves, unilateral vesicoureteral reflux and renal dysplasia; large congenital bladder diverticula and urinary extravasation can serve as a \"pop-off\" mechanism to buffer high pressures in the urinary tract and to lead to the preservation of better renal function in boys with posterior urethral valves.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of inhibitors of plasminogen activator has been shown to play an important role in regulation of fibrinolysis and postoperative thrombosis. Platelets and endothelium are sources of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). This study determines the contribution of platelet-released PAI to perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown. PAI levels were measured in 25 patients having aortic surgery. In nine patients the platelet-released PAI contribution was determined by in vitro activation of platelets with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). Mean preoperative PAI levels (3.78 +/- 1.19 U/ml) were similar to controls (3.01 +/- 1.04 U/ml) (p greater than 0.05). Plasma PAI showed an operative increase to a maximum at 8 hours postoperatively and returning to preoperative values by the second postoperative day. In the nine patients who were subjected to studies with in vitro activation, the preoperative PAI level (4.0 +/- 0.9 U/ml) was elevated to 5.1 +/- 0.7 U/ml (p = 0.001) with PMA induction. Maximum stimulated release of platelet granule contents (platelet releasate) could account for an increase of only 1.0 U/ml compared with a postoperative increase of 2.3 U/ml. Postoperative mean peak plasma PAI (6.3 +/- 0.4 U/ml) could not be further elevated by induced release (6.3 +/- 0.4 U/ml) (p = 0.003). A statistically significant increase in PAI occurred in aortic surgery patients postoperatively. The platelet releasable pool of PAI contributed to the increase and was functionally exhausted postoperatively. Postoperative increases of PAI were twice that induced by platelet in vitro stimulation alone. The perioperative increase in PAI was partly due to platelet release.\r"

The spasm was refractory to oral calcium channel blocking agents and direct intraarterial infusion of tolazoline (Priscoline). However, intraarterial nitroglycerin produced a prompt and dramatic improvement in symptoms and in physical and arteriographic findings. This experience suggests that intraarterial nitroglycerin may be an appropriate first choice for ergot-induced arterial spasm.\r"

Fifty-six (75%) of the 75 hemophiliacs were antibody positive and 55 (98%) of the 56 with antibodies also had positive cultures. The one culture-negative individual had detectable HIV-1 proviral DNA sequences in three separate samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA, as detected by a polymerase chain reaction assay. Detection of serum p24 antigen and the time to development of a positive culture were significantly more frequent and shorter, respectively, in symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients. None of the 19 hemophiliacs negative for HIV-1 antibody had positive cultures, detectable p24 serum antigen, or symptoms of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, latent HIV-1 infection was not detected in 16 female sexual partners of hemophiliacs positive for HIV-1 antibody using Western blot testing, assays for p24 antigen, HIV-1 cultures, and polymerase chain reaction assays, despite repeated unprotected sexual exposure. We conclude that antibody-positive hemophiliacs have been actively infected by HIV-1 and that a long period of latent HIV-1 infection prior to overt seroconversion is unlikely.\r"

To determine the effect of this alteration in intrarenal blood flow distribution on pressure relationships in inner medullary structures and their significance as a determinant of ANP-induced natriuresis, we measured hydraulic pressures in vascular and tubule elements of the renal papilla exposed in Munich-Wistar rats in vivo during an euvolemic baseline period and again during an experimental period. Rats in Group 1 received intravenous infusion of rANP administered as a 4 micrograms/kg prime and 0.5 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion, and were maintained euvolemic by plasma replacement. Infusion of ANP resulted in significant natriuresis, diuresis and increase in inulin clearance. Within 90 seconds of initiation of this systemic infusion, vasa recta hydraulic pressures were markedly increased and exceeded the small pressure increment occurring in loops of Henle and collecting ducts. Infusion of furosemide in Group 2 rats at a dosage which reproduced the increase in urine flow in Group 1 was associated with small and equivalent increases in both vascular and tubule elements, indicating that the differential pressure response observed in Group 1 was not due to increased tubule fluid flow rates, but was rather a specific ANP-induced vascular effect. Group 3 rats received an infusion of ANP in a setting where its whole kidney hemodynamic effects were prevented. This resulted in a marked blunting of natriuresis and diuresis, and obliteration of the pressure differential between vasa recta and tubules observed in Group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The monitored biological effects were release of PGE2, TXB2 or interleukin 1 and generation of O2- radicals. To further explore the mechanisms involved, phospholipid metabolism was studied by measuring IP3 and DG (14C-arachidonic or oleic acid prelabeled U937 and HL60 cells); changes of cytosolic Ca++ (Quin2 technique) were also determined. The results show that in absence of C, brief (2 min) contact with cuprammonium (CU) stimulated: (a) PGE2 release in U937 and human monocytes or GEC; (b) TXB2 release in washed platelets; (c) slow interleukin 1 release by monocytes; and (d) generation of O2- radicals in PMN. Artifacts due to endotoxin were excluded by appropriate polymyxin control experiments and by comparison of effects with those of bacterial LPS. Potential synthesis of C3 by U937 was excluded by addition of anti-C3 F(ab)2. C-independent cell activation was accompanied by increase of DG, but not IP3 (suggesting involvement of protein C kinase dependent mechanisms) and by increased cytosolic Ca++. To further explore the initial signal involved, incubations were carried out with covalently modified CU members (DEAE cellulose) and in the presence of mM concentrations of monosaccharides. Cationic modification of CU membranes reduced C-independent cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Citrate, magnesium, phosphate, pyrophosphate, chondroitinsulphate, pentosanpolysulphate and heparin were tested in a wide range of concentrations. The solubility of calcium oxalate crystals was increased only by citrate and magnesium. The crystal growth was inhibited by all compounds tested, but those with the high mol wt had the greatest effect at low concentrations. In contrast, inhibition of crystal agglomeration was achieved only by the low mol wt compounds; citrate was found to be the most potent inhibitor at concentrations likely to be present in normal urine. The high mol wt substances, despite their potent crystal growth inhibitory activity, had no effect on agglomeration. The results show that growth and agglomeration of calcium oxalate crystals are separate processes which are differently modulated by various compounds. They further provide a possible explanation for the pathogenetic role of citrate in hypocitraturic renal stone disease.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in plasma protein C and antithrombin concentrations after liver transplantation were monitored in fourteen children and a control group of fourteen adults. In the children, there was a persistent deficiency in the plasma concentration of protein C and a less pronounced deficiency in antithrombin during the early postoperative period, causing a hypercoaguable state. A concomitant rise in plasminogen activator inhibitor further increased the risk of thrombosis by inhibiting fibrinolysis. These changes coincided with the peak incidence of portal vessel thrombosis (4-10 days). Replacement of plasma antithrombin, together with heparin, did not prevent portal thrombosis in two of the children. It is concluded that successful prevention will require protein C replacement together with antithrombin supplements up to, but not exceeding, normal plasma activity.\r"

Three patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and one patient had inflammatory heart disease. Preparations from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy showed reduced contractile response to the cAMP-increasing agent isoprenaline and an increase in myocardial Gi-proteins, compared with preparations from non-failing hearts. Therefore it is conceivable that an increase in myocardial Gi-proteins is causally related to heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In the preparation from the patient with inflammatory heart disease the contractile response to isoprenaline was not reduced and likewise content of Gi-proteins was not changed.\r"

No single technique will be adequate for all patients, but our experience with percutaneous gastrostomy has encouraged us to recommend it as a valuable alternative to conventional modalities. The charts of 156 patients, identified by computer-assisted search as having undergone gastrostomy at Stanford University Hospital or Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital from 1984 to 1987, were reviewed. Of these, 24 patients with a primary diagnosis of head and neck malignancy underwent percutaneous gastrostomy and form the basis for this study. Parameters evaluated included operation time, type of anesthesia, perioperative complications, and cost. Percutaneous gastrostomy can be performed under local anesthesia or at the time of routine head and neck procedures such as staging endoscopy. Our success with this technique leads us to recommend it as a valuable alternative for providing nutrition to head and neck cancer patients.\r"

Such conduction disturbances are normally reversible within minutes. Inhibition of the activity of the membrane-bound Na+-K+ATPase prevents the recovery from conduction block. Withdrawal of external Ca2+ also prevents recovery, whereas blockade of protein synthesis by cycloheximide has no influence. The velocity of recovery depends on the temperature, with temperature coefficients (Q10) from 1.31 to 1.84 between 2 degrees and 30 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy of nerves subjected to strong discharges shows alterations of the myelin sheath (splitting and cleft formation) which are, however, not specific for this mechanism of injury. No alterations are seen in the region of the free axoplasmic membrane of the node of Ranvier or in organelles. The results suggest a breakdown of the transmembrane ionic gradient causing the conduction disturbance.\r"

The ionophore does not induce damage in denervated preparations or in preparations pretreated with d-tubocurarine, which indicates that the effect is indirect and neurally mediated. It is concluded that the increase in spontaneous transmitter release produced by the ionophore induces Ca2+ influx through the acetylcholine receptor.

We compared the ventilation response in seven recipients of heart-lung transplants who had normal pulmonary function and seven recipients of heart transplants, all of whom performed incremental bicycle ergometry. The level of ventilation in recipients of heart-lung transplants was similar to that in heart-transplant recipients for equivalent levels of carbon dioxide production. Arterial pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide at maximal exercise were normal and not significantly different in the two groups, also suggesting that levels of ventilation were appropriate in both groups. However, the rate of the rise in respiratory rate for increasing levels of ventilation was significantly lower in recipients of heart-lung transplants than in heart-transplant recipients, and the initial increase in tidal volume was more rapid in the former group than in the latter. Thus, recipients of heart-lung transplants have an appropriate level of ventilation during exercise as the result of a disproportionate increase in tidal volume at a reduced respiratory rate. We speculate that intrapulmonary receptors are important in regulating the pattern, but not the absolute level, of ventilation during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) atrial natriuretic factors/peptides (ANFs/ANPs) were measured in 26 patients with normal or raised intracranial pressure (ICP) by means of an instant radioreceptor assay. All 26 patients were suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 11 had also developed raised ICP (ICP greater than 20 mm Hg). In SAH patients with normal ICP, the plasma levels of ANF were 20 to 200 pg/ml (mean +/- SE, 89 +/- 68 pg/ml); in the 11 SAH patients with raised ICP, however, ANF levels were 14 to 262 pg/ml (mean 114 +/- 79 pg/ml). The difference was not statistically significant. The ANF/ANP plasma levels in 6 healthy volunteers were 15 to 167 pg/ml (mean 77 +/- 32 pg/ml). Although the ANF/ANP concentration in the CSF of patients with normal ICP did not reach the lower limit of detectability (i.e., 4 pg/ml) in any case, in those with elevated ICP it was 14 to 120 pg/ml (mean 49 +/- 37 pg/ml). This difference was statistically highly significant. The results of this preliminary study suggest that the ANF/ANP concentration in human CSF is 1 to 2 orders lower than that in the plasma and that there is no significant correlation between ANF/ANP levels in the CSF and the plasma. After SAH in patients with raised ICP, there was an accompanying increase in the ANF/ANP concentration in the CSF, but the ANF/ANP concentration in the plasma was not changed significantly. Accordingly, a central ANF/ANP release might be hypothesized to play a causative or adaptive role in the neuroendocrine regulation of ICP dynamics, although this may simply be an epiphenomenon.\r"

Although the reduced intracranial pressure was thought to be beneficial, serial computed tomographic scans suggested that the inverse steal response could have promoted cerebral edema, resulting in secondary brain injury.\r"

Several important observations emerged from this study of collegiate athletes. First, the eumenorrheic athletes began sports training earlier than the oligomenorrheic athletes. Second, oligomenorrheic athletes displayed significantly lower serum estradiol concentrations during cycle weeks 2 and 3 but had a rise in this hormone concentration during cycle week 4. Significant differences in serum gonadotropin concentrations during week 4 were found in the oligomenorrheic athletes. Finally, no significant difference in spinal mineral density values was found in the three groups.\r"

Cutaneous temperature recording and plasma LH pulsatility were studied in eight patients from each group. Veralipride administration (100 mg/day for 30 days) induced a significant (P less than .01) reduction in vasomotor symptoms and was more effective (P less than .05) than placebo. Treatment was followed by the expected increase (P less than .001) in plasma prolactin levels and by a significant decrease (P less than .05) in mean plasma LH. A significant reduction (P less than .01) was observed in objectively recorded hot flushes after Veralipride treatment, whereas there was no significant change in the characteristics of LH pulsatility. Infusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone (N = 5) induced a significant (P less than .01) increase in LH secretion after Veralipride administration. These results suggest that the endogenous opioid system may mediate the endocrine and clinical effects of long-term Veralipride treatment.\r"

Following a classification derived from Melchior, six FHR patterns were recognized: 0, 1, 2a, 2b, 3, and 4. In the second stage of labor, until bearing-down efforts began, the fetal acid-base status did not change regardless of the type of tracing. At the time of delivery, as compared with values measured before the beginning of the final stage, the highest shift of lactic acid, coupled with the lowest pH shift, was associated with the type 3 pattern. The most rapid increases of lactic acid and pCO2 and decreases in pH were associated with type 2b patterns. Both type 3 and 2b patterns were ominous, but low Apgar scores were more frequent in type 3 because the duration of the final stage of labor was longer. Working from the mean slopes of the shifts of biologic parameters as a function of time, theoretical limits were derived and discussed for safe duration of the final stage of labor.\r"

  ".W": "It has been hypothesized that hypoxanthine concentrations in the blood of newborn infants are a marker of asphyxia. To test this hypothesis, we measured serum hypoxanthine levels in relationship to perinatal and neonatal asphyxia, and compared arterial hypoxanthine levels with arterial pH and base deficit. We also compared hypoxanthine levels of survivors with those of asphyxiated non-survivors. Forty-two newborns were classified as asphyxiated by either of two methods: 1) Infants from whom umbilical cord hypoxanthine levels were taken were classified as asphyxiated if they had an Apgar score of 6 or less at 1 or 5 minutes, fetal heart rate below 100 beats per minute, or meconium-stained amniotic fluid; and 2) infants from whom peripheral arterial hypoxanthine samples were taken were classified by clinical assessment, whereby one author, blinded to the infants' hypoxanthine levels, prospectively assessed each patient's condition for evidence of asphyxia. Hypoxanthine levels correlated with increased base deficit (P less than .001; r = 0.8) and with decreased pH (P less than .001; r = -0.5). By both of our asphyxia classification methods, hypoxanthine levels were significantly higher (P less than .002) in the asphyxiated groups. We also noted a higher hypoxanthine level in asphyxiated non-survivors as compared with all survivors (P less than .02). We propose that serum hypoxanthine levels may help define asphyxia. Because hypoxanthine, when metabolized by xanthine oxidase, generates oxygen radicals that are highly destructive to tissue, hypoxanthine levels may have important therapeutic implications for asphyxiated patients.\r"

Objective clinical signs were graded weekly by an ophthalmologist while patients kept a daily record of the severity of their symptoms. Sixty-five patients completed the study; 35 received cromolyn sodium and 30 were treated with a matching placebo (the drug vehicle). Statistically significant differences in favor of cromolyn sodium treatment were found for conjunctival injection, limbal injection, limbal edema, tearing, and symptoms summary score. There were few side effects (usually mild stinging and burning which did not require drug stoppage). Only one patient required drug discontinuation for possible drug- or vehicle-related side effects. Cromolyn sodium was found to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating the signs and symptoms of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). When results were stratified in terms of the atopic status of the patient, it was clear that the allergic patients responded better to cromolyn sodium than did those in whom allergic (IgE-mediated) factors appeared unimportant in the disease process.\r"

A case of 16 years' duration was associated with an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy and recurrent uveitis. The corneal changes were unusually extensive and distributed throughout all corneal layers. The deposits consisted of diffuse, small, polymorphic aggregates, which were iridescent in the superficial cornea, mat elsewhere, and associated with a diffuse stromal haze; specular microscopy showed additional features. Both corneas were thickened. The deposits failed to stain histochemically, except patchily with Masson Trichrome. There was extensive immunohistochemical labeling for IgG, kappa, and surprisingly, lambda. Ultrastructurally, pleomorphic deposits were found in every corneal cell; paracrystalline deposits with internal banding were seen only in the basal epithelium. Keratocytes and endothelial cells were damaged and reduced in number. Disease recurred in a corneal graft. Three main types of paraproteinemic keratopathy can be distinguished. The deposits probably represent various metabolic products of the monoclonal protein. This is not necessarily a benign condition; hematologic control may be necessary on purely ophthalmological criteria.\r"

Most commonly, this condition is found in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but may be seen with other collagen-vascular diseases and in otherwise healthy individuals. Despite the laboratory tests suggesting impaired coagulation, clinically the lupus anticoagulant has been associated with thrombosis. The authors present five patients with the lupus anticoagulant who came to medical attention because of branch retinal artery occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, transient visual loss, transient diplopia, or vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Eleven previously reported patients with the lupus anticoagulant and disturbed vision are also reviewed with additional findings of retinal venous occlusive disease and homonymous visual field loss. The relationship of these findings to retinopathy in SLE is discussed. Patients with the lupus anticoagulant (with or without SLE) may develop disturbances in vision due to thrombosis from a hypercoagulable state. We recommended obtaining a PTT, VDRL, and the more sensitive anticardiolipin antibody in patients with unexplained visual symptoms.\r"

The ridge or groove ran across the top of the pulp horn to the pulp roof in the direction of the other horns. Such a linear ridge or groove was found in 32 of 50 specimens (64%).

Performance of these procedures has enabled many severely disabled individuals to resume a virtually normal way of life. Unlike many other operative procedures, however, the ultimate success of total joint replacement depends not only on the surgery itself, but on appropriate preoperative planning and postoperative management. This does not end when the patient leaves the hospital but should be made a part of the patient's way of life forever. With an appropriate postoperative routine, the average patient can expect many years of satisfactory use of his or her total joint. A realistic approach must be adopted and certain simple restrictions and limitations must be clearly borne in mind. The patient must be conscious of the fact that although the artificial joint causes little or no pain and functions extremely well, it is, in fact, an artificial joint and not a normal joint. In simple terms he or she must be instructed to use it, not abuse it.\r"

Nasoendoscopy and videonasoendoscopy are valuable tools for examination of the abnormal pattern of velopharyngeal movement in patients with velopharyngeal incompetence. On the basis of the knowledge of the observed defect in velopharyngeal closure for the particular patient, a pharyngeal flap operation is planned. The flap width, level of placement of the flap base, and control of the lateral port size vary to suit each individual velopharyngeal closure defect. Postoperative speech results in 86 patients are reported.\r"

  ".W": "Many thyroid carcinomas seem to be dependent upon the thyroid growth-promoting properties of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the in vitro effect of TSH on tissue cultures derived from malignant and benign thyroid tumors. The results indicate that TSH can affect the morphology and protein synthesis of primary tissue cultures derived from benign and malignant thyroid tumors differently. The addition of TSH to cultures derived from benign tumors resulted in a reorganization of follicle-like structures of the monolayer and in a reduction of protein synthesis. In contrast to this, monolayers derived from carcinomas of the thyroid were not able to reorganize and their protein synthesis was not inhibited in the presence of TSH. For a better understanding of TSH suppressive therapy, we suggest testing the influence of TSH on a large number of tissue cultures derived from benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study concerns 188 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the soft palate, uvula, and anterior faucial pillar treated for cure between 1970 and 1983. Men predominated in the group (1.9:1) and 55% of the patients were between 60 and 70 years old. Mean duration of followup was 56.7 months. TNM stage distribution was 29, 67, 37, and 49 patients for stages I, II, III, and IV respectively; six patients were unstaged because of previous excisional biopsy. Treatment to the primary site consisted of radiotherapy for 150 patients, surgery alone for 28 patients, and combined therapy for 10 patients. Primary control for T stages 1 through 4 was: 91% (31 of 34), 77% (71 of 92), 77% (30 of 39), and 35% (6 of 17), respectively. One hundred twenty-eight patients were N0 at presentation, as compared to 60 patients with regional nodal metastasis. Regional control was obtained in 87.5% of patients with N0 necks and in 76.7% of those with nodal involvement. In patients with primary control, these figures were 89% and 81%. Overall determinant survival was 80% at 2 years, but fell to 67% at 5 years. In addition to advanced tumor stage, the survival rate was reduced by regional lymph node metastasis. Tumor extension to the tongue base diminished survival. Survival was poorer among patients with midline tumors or tumors that extended across the palatine arch (37 patients) than for those with unilateral primary tumors (151 patients) (p less than 0.05). Despite similar T-stage distribution, the incidence of regional nodal metastasis was 49% in the former group, compared with 28% in the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In normal individuals, the visual and vestibular systems interact through a common subcortical center located near the vestibular nuclei. When the patient is healthy, this interaction allows appropriate integration of what might otherwise be conflicting information regarding environmental motion and moving within the environment. In patients with active peripheral vestibular lesions, such as those seen in Meniere's disease, this delicate interaction loses effectiveness. In such patients, optokinetic stimuli are capable of precipitating episodes of incapacitating vertigo with its associated vegetative symptoms (abnormal oculovestibular response--AOVR). Since the brainstem is unable to accommodate for active peripheral lesions, suffering may be prolonged for many years. Vestibular nerve section, however, converts this active lesion to a static peripheral lesion, allowing for brainstem compensation and cessation of optokinetic-induced vertiginous symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the direct cytotoxic and photosensitizing effects of dihematoporphyrin-ether (DHE) on the head and neck squamous cancer cell line, UM-SCC-38. Normal fibroblasts, normal cultured keratinocytes, and the UM-MEL-1 pigmented malignant melanoma cell line were used as controls. The parameters of duration of light exposure, drug concentration, and incubation periods were studied. Uptake of DHE by squamous cancer cells, as assessed microscopically by intensity of fluorescence, was rapid and reached a dose-dependent maximum intensity within 10 minutes. Cells were irradiated with polychromatic light with an energy of one milliwatt/cm2 at a distance of 1.5 ft. Cells growing in plastic dishes were incubated in the dark for 1 to 4 hours with DHE in concentrations that ranged from 1.25 to 50 micrograms/ml. The cell monolayers were washed and irradiated for periods of time ranging from 15 to 120 min. Dose-dependent loss of cell viability could be detected by trypan blue dye uptake as early as 1 hour after radiation and continued to increase until 4 hours after light exposure. No further loss of cell viability was observed over the next 10 hours. There was no phototoxicity in the absence of DHE. UM-SCC-38 cells were more sensitive to the photosensitizing effects of DHE than were either normal fibroblasts or malignant melanoma cells. Recovery from the photosensitizing effects of DHE was observed if the DHE-containing medium was removed and the cells were incubated in the dark for periods that ranged from 1 to 14 hours before light exposure. UM-SCC-38 cells recovered more rapidly than normal fibroblasts, normal keratinocytes, or UM-MEL-1 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Patients in whom fistula speech has developed after laryngectomy usually have to occlude their stoma with a finger to talk. This prevents the air that is needed to activate the fistula from being exhaled through the stoma. In order to free the hand, Blom and Singer devised a diaphragm-valved stomal device known as the tracheostoma valve. This device snaps into a flexible retention housing that must be carefully cemented to the skin. Some patients who have undergone near-total laryngectomy (and others with tracheo-esophageal voice prostheses) are unable to use their devices because the moisture and pressure around their stomas break the seal. Since air that is used to produce voice with the valve tends to lift the housing away from the stoma, a better housing design would assure that this motion would improve the seal.\r"
