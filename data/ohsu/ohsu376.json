With the current knowledge of both calcium homeostasis and the function and properties of cellular Ca2+-target proteins/signal transduction systems, a dysfunction of cellular calcium metabolism is considered in relation to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Although the enhanced peripheral vascular resistance characteristic of hypertension is ultimately a function of Ca2+ availability for smooth muscle cell contraction, the platelet possesses many parallel biochemical and physiologic properties. Therefore, we have utilized the platelet as the cell model for investigating the role of Ca2+ in hypertension disorders. An overview of Ca2+-linked platelet processes altered in essential hypertension is presented, and an attempt is made to integrate these multiple aberrations in a fundamental membrane lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Previous data from this laboratory suggest that Ca-induced reductions in blood pressure may result in part from Ca-induced natriuresis and a possible reduction in intravascular volume. Consequently, the present study was conducted to directly determine the relative effects of dietary Ca and Na on total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) as measured by tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance and to determine the potential relationship of these changes to diet-induced changes in blood pressure. Eleven hypertensive black adults were maintained for 14 days on each of four diets that contained 356 mg Ca or 1,000 mg Ca, each at 1,000 or 4,000 mg Na in a repeated measures design. Increasing dietary Na at the low Ca intake caused significant increases in supine systolic and diastolic pressure, reduced plasma renin activity (PRA), significantly increased TBW, and caused a significant reduction in total body reactance indicating an increase in ECW. Adding supplementary Ca to the low Na diet was without significant effect on blood pressure, PRA, TBW, or electrical reactance. In contrast, adding Ca to the low Ca-high Na diet caused a significant natriuretic effect that was accompanied by significant increases in PRA and electrical reactance and significant reductions in blood pressure and TBW, to baseline (low Ca-low Na levels). Thus, these data indicate that the antihypertensive effect of calcium in salt-sensitive blacks may be attributable, in part, to Ca-induced natriuresis and an associated volume contraction.\r"

Evidence is presented that activation of one projection of serotonin-containing neurons from the midbrain to the hypothalamus elevates arterial pressure. Evidence is also presented that activation of a projection descending from the lateral B3 serotonin cell group to the spinal cord elicits a pressor response that is accompanied by increased release of serotonin in the spinal cord and is independent of the C1 adrenaline-containing neurons that lie close by. In contradistinction, experiments are described demonstrating that activation of the midline group of B3 serotonin cells in the raphe nucleus causes a fall in arterial pressure, consistent with the view that different groups of serotonin neurons in the brain and spinal cord participate in the control of blood pressure in diverse ways and can have different effects on blood pressure. Finally, experiments are described showing that the hypotensive action of methyldopa is mediated in part through central serotonin nerves.\r"

  ".U": "88221891\r", 
  ".W": "Although the association of obesity and hypertension is well recognized, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of increased blood pressure in the obese are poorly understood. Recent studies addressing the impact of 1) body fat distribution on blood pressure and 2) dietary intake on sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity suggest a plausible hypothesis that relates the hypertension of the obese to hyperinsulinemia and SNS stimulation. Hypertension in the obese is associated with fat accumulation in the upper body segments; this type of obesity is also characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Insulin, moreover, is an important signal in the relationship between dietary intake and SNS activity: increased insulin levels are associated with SNS stimulation. The hyperinsulinemia of obesity may, therefore, increase blood pressure by 1) direct effects of insulin to stimulate renal sodium reabsorption, and 2) sympathetic stimulation of the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. Conversely, SNS suppression and diminished insulin following caloric restriction may explain the hypotensive effects of caloric restriction in obese hypertensive subjects. The hypothesis presented here emphasizes the important role of diet in the treatment of obese hypertensive subjects. The efficacy of caloric restriction, weight loss, and exercise in reducing blood pressure in the obese is linked to diminished insulin and SNS activity and may be viewed as evidence in favor of this hypothesis.\r"

  ".U": "88221892\r", 
  ".W": "Most antihypertensive drugs act by counteracting vasoconstrictor mechanisms and lower blood pressure by lowering vascular resistance. The beta-blockers, which have the unique feature of counteracting cardiac sympathetic drive, seem to be a major exception to this generalization. Moreover, their degree of cardiodepression is not only directly correlated with the initial sympathetic tone, but also with their degree of intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA). Cardiodepression initially evokes a proportional rise in vascular resistance. As indicated by review of the literature, the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers always parallels a decline in vascular resistance. Minimizing cardiac sympathetic drive by strict bedrest and studying beta-blockers with different degrees of ISA in 50 hypertensive patients showed that initially the effect of the drugs is offset by a rise in vascular resistance proportional to the fall in cardiac output. After that, blood pressure always fell parallel with the decline in vascular resistance. In the long run blood pressure and vascular resistance were always positively correlated, whatever the level of cardiac output. Thus, like all other antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers also lower blood pressure through interference with a vasoconstrictor mechanism.\r"

The form and topography of the surface of the artificial organ, medical device, prosthesis, or biomaterial can determine the composition of the foreign body reaction. The normal foreign body reaction consists of macrophages and foreign body giant cells at the surface of the implant with subjacent fibroblastic proliferation and collagen deposition, and capillary formation. Macrophages play a pivotal role in the response of tissue to implants. An hypothesis on the role of complement activation and complement-mediated cellular adhesion to implant surfaces has been presented.

The author believes that future advances in graft design will enable prosthetic repair of two to four millimeter arteries and reconstruction of veins. This manuscript discusses the development of improved synthetic blood compatible surfaces with detailed consideration of prosthetic design factors such as pore size, biomaterial mechanical properties and thrombogenicity of the blood flow surface.\r"

There was a close association both at rest and on exercise between a higher ejection fraction and treatment with cyclosporin/azathioprine. There was a trend for lower donor and recipient age, shorter ischaemia time, and fewer rejection episodes to be associated with better left ventricular function, but this was not statistically significant. Left ventricular systolic function was well maintained in most patients a year after cardiac transplantation. The type of immunosuppression used had a strong influence on the left ventricular systolic function of the transplanted heart.\r"

Acute myocardial infarction was confirmed in 295 patients (146 in the nifedipine group and 149 in the placebo group). The median delay time to intervention with nifedipine in patients with acute myocardial infarction was 111 minutes. Infarct size was assessed by the estimation of release of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and creatine kinase from blood samples taken every four hours for 48 hours. The total mean (SEM) creatine kinase MB released was 406.4 (27.2) IU/l in the nifedipine group and 345.7 (20.5) IU/l in the placebo group. Total mean (SEM) creatine kinase released was 2749.6 (165.1) IU/l in the nifedipine group and 2698.4 (145.9) IU/l in the placebo group. In hospital mortality was similar for both the nifedipine and placebo groups (6.6% and 5.8% respectively).

After injection of contrast into the right atrium ventriculograms were obtained before and during balloon inflation. In 37 patients they were also obtained after the procedure. A 12 lead electrocardiogram was monitored throughout. During balloon inflation the left ventricular ejection fraction fell (from 73% to 57%) in all but one patient; the decreases in patients with single vessel or multivessel disease were similar. The fall in left ventricular ejection fraction during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery (19%) was significantly greater than that during balloon inflation in the right coronary (10%) or circumflex (8%) coronary arteries. It also reduced anterobasal, anterior, and apical segmental shortening while right coronary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty affected inferior and apical segments. In 33 (63%) patients the ST segment was altered during balloon inflation. The fall in left ventricular ejection fraction correlated significantly with the magnitude of both ST segment elevation (r = 0.637) and ST depression (r = 0.396). Left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion returned to baseline values after the procedure. Balloon inflation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty produces considerable abnormalities of global and regional left ventricular performance and this indicates the presence of myocardial ischaemia, which may not be apparent on electrocardiographic monitoring. Intravenous digital subtraction ventriculography is useful for monitoring left ventricular performance during controlled episodes of coronary occlusion produced by balloon inflation.\r"

Isovolumic relaxation time, the interval from minimum cavity dimension to mitral valve opening and relative dimension increase during this period, and the peak rate of dimension increase and wall thinning during rapid ventricular filling were measured by digitised M mode echocardiography. The relative heights of peak early diastolic and atrial velocities (a/E) and the time for decline of early diastolic velocity to half its peak value (velocity half time) were measured on continuous wave and pulsed Doppler and the relative height of the \"a\" wave was measured by apexcardiogram. All sets of values except those of the interval from minimum dimension to mitral opening were unimodally distributed, and all differed significantly from those in 20 age matched controls. The relative height of the \"a\" wave on the apexcardiogram (90% values were abnormal) was the most sensitive method of studying left ventricular diastolic function and peak rate of dimension increase was the least sensitive. Though none of the correlations was high, there were individual associations between peak rate of dimension increase, a/E, peak wall thinning rate, and velocity half time, and independently between delay in mitral valve opening and dimension change during this period. Other values seemed to be independent of one another, suggesting a different physiological basis.

The umbilical artery indices demonstrated a continuing fall with increasing gestation but the A/B ratio and resistance index from the fetal descending aorta did not change with gestation. The pulsatility index from the aorta demonstrated a gentle rise.\r"

Of the 280 patients who were assessable 138 were given amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and 142 received metronidazole; 268 underwent abdominal hysterectomy and 12 had vaginal hysterectomy. Patients in the amoxycillin-clavulanic acid group had significantly less infectious morbidity (13.8%) than those in the metronidazole group (33.1%). There were also statistically significant differences in favour of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid with respect to operative site infection, duration of hospital stay, need for postoperative antimicrobials, and surgery for operative site infection. But for one isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, all pathogens isolated from wound infections in the metronidazole group were aerobes. No anaerobes were isolated from patients in the amoxycillin-clavulanic acid group. The results suggest that prophylaxis for hysterectomy should consist of an agent, or combination of agents, with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid fulfils this criterion and appears to be effective and safe.\r"

Both cell lines were transplanted subcutaneously (2 x 10(5) or 2 x 10(6)/mouse) in male BALB/c nu/nu mice (n = 128) with a 97% success rate when coimplanted with nonproliferative HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (2 x 10(6)/mouse) in recipients preconditioned with total-body irradiation (200 R weekly for 3 weeks). Tumors appeared five to ten days postimplant and reached up to 25% of body weight after a mean survival of 8 weeks (range, 30 to 90 days). Tumor histology suggested large cell lymphoma. Cytochemically and immunophenotypically, tumor cells were indistinguishable from their parent cells. Species and lineage derivation of tumor cells was confirmed by antibody probes against the mouse histocompatibility antigen H-2, human T and B lymphocyte antigens, and the HCL-associated common chronic lymphocytic leukemia antigen (cCLLa). In order of decreasing frequency, metastases occurred in the spleen, lungs, pleura, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and kidneys. Up to 12% of circulating lymphoid cells in mice were cCLLa-positive, which suggested hematogenous tumor dissemination. This HCL xenotransplantation model might be useful in preclinical studies for exploring novel experimental therapies for the management of human HCL.\r"

Recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and GM-CSF primarily induce expression of the M-CSF gene and secretion of M-CSF, whereas bacterial lipopolysaccharide primarily induces expression of the G-CSF gene and secretion of G-CSF. These results suggest that under different conditions of in vitro stimulation the monocyte secretes factors that could lead selectively to either granulocyte or monocyte production.\r"

Eighty percent pure megakaryocytes were isolated from porcine rib bone marrow using Percoll gradients followed by counterflow centrifugation. Activation was prevented by prostacyclin and prefixation with low concentrations of glutaraldehyde. In early megakaryoblasts, standard EM revealed the presence of tubular structures in the small vesicles located in the Golgi area, in the small immature alpha-granules and in the rare mature alpha-granules. Immunolabeling for vWF was simultaneously observed in small vesicles and small alpha-granules, mainly in the Golgi zone. In mature megakaryocytes, standard EM showed that tubular structures were numerous, regularly spaced, and aligned in parallel. Immunolabeling for vWF was intense, restricted to the alpha-granules, and distributed in a similar manner to porcine platelets. Gold particles were located eccentrically at one pole of the alpha-granule, labeling only its periphery or outlining one side of an elongated granule. Tubule profiles could be seen underlying the immunolabeling and were usually located at one side of the granule. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of tubular structures in megakaryocyte alpha-granules, their association with vWF, and the appearance of both in the Golgi-associated vesicles.\r"

  ".W": "There has been recent interest in the synergistic interactions between the growth factors involved in the in vitro control of hematopoiesis and other cell lineages. As a convenient model system, such interactions governing the DNA synthesis in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were studied. By themselves, murine colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) were stimulators of DNA synthesis in quiescent or noncycling BMMs, whereas recombinant murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), were weak mitogens. On the other hand, murine granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), concanavalin A (Con A), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were inactive on their own. When the quiescent BMMs were exposed to combinations of the CSFs, there were striking synergistic effects for both GM-CSF and IL-3 with suboptimal doses of CSF-1, with a smaller effect for GM-CSF with IL-3 and little or no effect for CSF-1 with G-CSF. CSF-1, GM-CSF, and IL-3 could also synergize with TPA; CSF-1 cooperated with 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), both sets of results pointing to an interaction with protein kinase C. LPS completely abolished the CSF-1-mediated stimulation of DNA synthesis. We propose that BMMs are suitable normal cells in which to examine in depth the various mechanistic possibilities for these interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant gibbon interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a multilineage hematopoietic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) that recently was cloned and found to be highly homologous with human IL-3. Gibbon IL-3, as well as human granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and human granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), stimulated normal human bone marrow cells to form myeloid colonies in soft agar in a sigmoidal dose-response manner. When IL-3 was added to increasing concentrations of G-CSF or GM-CSF, synergistic colony formation occurred as compared with the effects of each CSF alone. Synergism was also noted when G-CSF was added with GM-CSF and when all the CSFs were added simultaneously. The combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF was less stimulatory than all the other CSF combinations. At day 11 of culture, IL-3 induced granulocyte-macrophage (38%), eosinophil (30%), granulocyte (18%), and macrophage (14%) colony formation. In summary, gibbon IL-3 is a growth factor that can synergize with other CSFs to enhance proliferation of myeloid-committed progenitors, suggesting that combinations of CSFs may have clinical utility in patients with neutropenia of various etiologies.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms that determine and regulate platelet size are unknown. By phase microscopy, we observed that Wistar Furth (WF) rats had macrothrombocytopenia. In this study, we have characterized and compared platelets and megakaryocytes of WF rats with those of Wistar, Long-Evans hooded (LE), and Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, we have examined the mode of inheritance of this WF rat platelet abnormality. The average platelet count of WF rats was only one-third that of the other three rat strains. In contrast, the mean platelet volume (MPV) of adult WF rats was twice that of the other rat strains; however, the average megakaryocyte diameter and DNA content distribution of WF rats were not significantly different from those of LE rats. The average megakaryocyte concentration was 30% lower in the WF strain compared with that of LE rats. Mazelike membrane formations were observed in WF platelets and megakaryocytes by electron microscopy. Reciprocal crosses of WF and LE rats resulted in offspring with MPVs and platelet counts like those of LE rats, indicating that the macrothrombocytopenic trait is recessive in its inheritance. Reciprocal marrow transplants between the WF and LE strains resulted in MPVs like those of the donor strain, demonstrating that the macrothrombocytopenia is an intrinsic marrow abnormality of the WF strain. Splenectomy did not alter the MPV of WF rats. The response of WF megakaryocytes and platelets to severe, acute thrombocytopenia was similar to that of LE rats except that the shift to higher megakaryocyte DNA contents was muted and platelet recovery was slower in the WF rats. In summary, the WF rat has a hereditary macrothrombocytopenia that is recessive in nature and not due to differences in megakaryocyte size or DNA content. These results suggest that the macrothrombocytopenia of WF rats results from the formation of fewer platelets per megakaryocyte, possibly resulting from a qualitative or quantitative defect in some component necessary for proper subdivision of megakaryocyte cytoplasm into platelets.\r"

By virtue of their relation to AML, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) provide an in vivo model of human leukemogenesis. By using a strategy for analysis of gene mutation based on in vitro amplification of target sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and selective oligonucleotide hybridization we analyzed the mutational status of codons 12, 13, and 61 of Ha-ras, K-ras, and N-ras in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) in 34 cases of primary MDS. Mutations at codon 12 of Ki-ras or N-ras were detected in three cases (9%): one of six cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and two of nine cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The nucleotide substitution differed in each. In all cases the mutant allele was detectable in PB cells. A sustained hematologic remission was achieved after low-dose cytarabine therapy in the case of RAEB. Neither case of CMML exhibited signs of disease progression during follow-up at 7 and 12 months. In contrast, four of 31 patients without the ras mutation underwent transformation to AML within 12 months of genetic analysis. We conclude that ras mutations in MDS are heterogeneous and may develop at an early stage during the evolution of MDS. Their detection in PB cells illustrates the potential utility of ras mutation as a clonal marker in myeloid malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "At present, one of the most sensitive assays for human erythropoietin (Ep) is a bioassay that measures the Ep-dependent proliferation of spleen cells from phenylhydrazine-treated mice after 24 hours in culture. We describe how this assay can be used as the basis of a very sensitive method for detecting mouse antibodies to biologically active human Ep. In this procedure, microtiter wells are first coated with goat anti-mouse Ig antibody, then treated with mouse antibodies (serum or hybridoma culture supernatants), and finally incubated with a fixed amount of pure human Ep. Specific binding of anti-Ep antibodies is detected by adding spleen cells from phenylhydrazine-treated mice to the wells and measuring the ability of the cells to incorporate 3H-thymidine 24 hours later. This bioimmunosorbent assay (BISA) revealed the presence of anti-EP antibodies in sera from mice immunized with either pure human urinary Ep or a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to the aminoterminal region of Ep and in the culture supernatants from three of eight stable anti-Ep antibody-producing hybridoma cell lines that we have isolated. The three monoclonal antibodies showed similar reactivities in the BISA, but showed different affinities for Ep, with Kd values of approximately 0.7, 8, and 240 nmol/L, respectively. Further studies showed that all antibodies were capable of neutralizing Ep bioactivity and of binding 125I-labeled Ep in a radioimmunosorbent assay (RIA) but were virtually unreactive to Ep adsorbed to the bottom of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) wells. Our results suggest that the BISA strategy may be an important complement to conventional RIA and ELISA techniques for identification of monoclonal antibodies specific for biologically active growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients with a wide spectrum of spinal dysraphic lesions were studied by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and myelography complemented by computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be superior for tissue characterization, overall anatomical definition, topographical relationships of the cranio-cervical junction and demonstration of the presence and extent of hydrosyringomyelia. Demonstration by CT myelography of fine neural structures such as the filum terminale and nerve roots remains the superior technique; however, with constantly improving spatial resolution and thinner-slice imaging, MRI will become increasingly competitive in this respect. The osseous component of these lesions was best demonstrated by CT myelography. A high incidence of associated syrinx (8/15 cases) was found in the diastematomyelia group, with an overall incidence of 15 cases in all the dysraphic patients studied. The use of both T1- and T2-weighted sequences is required for tissue characterization. Whilst both imaging modalities proved complementary in the investigation of spinal dysraphism, we suggest that, with its superior tissue characterization and anatomical display of these lesions. MRI should be the primary imaging technique. Avoidance of an invasive procedure and use of ionizing radiation confers additional benefits upon MRI. The relative ease and shorter examination time of MRI makes this technique ideal for pre- and post-operative monitoring and assessment.\r"

Four parameters were evaluated: the corticomedullary differentiation; the relative thickness of the cortex; the evolution, with echo number, of the relative signal intensities of kidney parenchyma and adjacent fatty tissue on images generated by a long time to repeat multiecho sequence; and the proximal vascularization. The loss of corticomedullary differentiation is the major finding in acute rejection, but it is not specific as it is also observed in chronic rejection and in the much rarer acute glomerulonephritis. Thickening of the cortex is helpful for the detection of rejected transplants with visible corticomedullary delineation (26% of the cases). Uncomplicated acute tubular necrosis appears as a normal transplant.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty four patients were referred for cardiac transplantation from a single cardiac team at this hospital between October 1984 and December 1986. Of these patients, 33 were referred for urgent transplantation, all of whom required intensive treatment in hospital with intravenous infusions of cardiac drugs, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, peritoneal dialysis, ventilation, or any combination of these to sustain life. Of these 33 patients, six died while awaiting transplantation, one was removed from the waiting list for a transplant, and 26 received cardiac transplants. There were five deaths within 24 hours of operation and one death 10 days after the operation. Twenty of those who had surgery had a successful outcome of transplantation, but there was one late death 10 weeks postoperatively and a further death 31 months after surgery. Eighteen patients were alive and well 10 to 33 months (mean 19.4 months) after transplantation, with an overall survival rate after surgery of 69%. Provided that surgery can be performed before renal failure has progressed such that renal dialysis [corrected] is necessary, the results are excellent (surgical survival 85.5%) and, we believe, justify the expenditure and staffing requirements necessary to treat these terminally ill patients.\r"

Their proper recognition and treatment rank second only to the modification of risk factors in importance for stroke prevention. Carotid endarterectomy, although widely used to treat TIAs, remains unproven; randomized clinical trials are attempting to define its role. Anticoagulant therapy appears worth while for suspected cardiac embolism and possibly for disabling TIAs. Acetylsalicylic acid is the only agent that has been found to be effective in controlled trials, but questions persist about its dosage, its efficacy in women and its use after stroke. Another platelet inhibitor, ticlopidine hydrochloride, is being investigated and may prove to be an effective alternative.\r"

Two important actions that will make this goal possible are the prevention of cancers that are caused by known carcinogens and the earlier detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals. Current knowledge about the cause of cancer makes it prudent for persons to change their lifestyles (primary prevention). Tobacco products are the number one culprit in cancer cause and it is estimated that 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States would not occur if tobacco use had been avoided. The sound principles of cancer prevention and early detection need to be applied by primary care physicians and community cancer centers working together. Caution must be advised when recommending a variety of diets and medicines that, as yet, have no proven value in cancer prevention. Cancer control research is needed to expand cancer control applications in a cost effective and acceptable manner.\r"

In 1980, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reasserted its emphasis on early detection with the publication of guidelines for the cancer-related check-up which include recommendations for the early detection of cancer of the cervix, breast, and large bowel. These recommendations as well as detection of early lung cancer are discussed. Prevention of death by early detection and effective therapy is a precursor to efforts to prevent clinical cancer entirely. Thirty-three percent of cancer deaths could be avoided if people chose not to use tobacco. Diet and nutrition probably account for another 33% of cancers. In 1984 the ACS published dietary recommendations for cancer risk reduction; these are discussed in the text. The status of prevention and detection is reviewed and some speculation is made about future prospects.\r"

  ".W": "Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease. They can be activated by immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated mechanisms to release powerful mediators affecting local blood flow. We have determined systematically serum IgE concentrations in 100 patients with acute myocardial infarction. There was a consistent pattern of change in serum IgE, characterized by a significant increase on the third and fifth day, peak values on the seventh day, and a gradual decline to initial levels by the end of the third week after infarction. The increase in serum IgE shortly after myocardial infarction was similar to the increase in blood eosinophil count, but was in contrast to serum IgG levels. After infarction, patients with high initial IgE levels (greater than 200 IU/ml) had a greater increase in IgE and less frequent severe complications than those whose initial IgE levels were below 200 IU/ml. In 16 subjects with acute coronary insufficiency without infarction serum IgE levels remained unchanged. It is suggested that in myocardial infarction circulating IgE sensitizes both mast cells of coronary arteries and eosinophils, invading ischemic myocardium; this facilitates release of chemical mediators. Patients with high IgE levels might be protected against complications of infarction because of a favorable ratio of locally released mediators and because of decreased platelet function.\r"

We sought a possible mechanical explanation for the phenomenon by studying the development of the coronary vasculature in 351 staged, serially sectioned human embryos of Carnegie stages 9 through 23 from the Carnegie Embryological Collection. A plexus of blind epicardial capillaries appears on the heart in Carnegie stage 14 or 15 and acquires a coronary sinus connection in stage 15, 16, or 17. The connection of the proximal coronary arteries to the aorta does not appear until stage 18. We found no histologic features of the cardiac nerves or any other component of the tissues to account for the consistent origin of coronary arteries from the right and left aortic sinuses of Valsalva. However, serial section reconstructions showed that the two sinuses where coronary arteries develop acquire a positive transverse curvature and a negative longitudinal curvature, i.e., a catenoidal or saddle-shaped configuration, before the appearance of the coronary arteries. The four noncoronary sinuses also have a positive transverse curvature, but longitudinally, in contrast, they have a positive curvature or are straight. The results suggest that the coronary arteries originate from those sinuses of Valsalva where wall tension is increased by a catenoidal configuration.\r"

We have investigated the effect of DDAVP administration in a double-blind, randomized, prospective trial including 100 patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery. Fifty patients received 0.3 micrograms/kg DDAVP and 50 patients received a placebo administered in a 50 ml saline solution over 15 min when cardiopulmonary bypass had been concluded. Results showed no significant differences either in total blood loss per square meter (458 +/- 206 ml in the DDAVP group vs 536 +/- 304 ml in the placebo group) or in necessity for red cell transfusions (1642 +/- 705 ml in the DDAVP group vs 1574 +/- 645 ml in the placebo group) in the first 72 hr after surgery. Only intraoperative blood loss per square meter was significantly lower (p less than .02) in the DDAVP group (131 +/- 106 ml) as compared with the placebo group (193 +/- 137 ml). The prolongation of bleeding time and the decrease of factor VIII:C and factor VIII:von Willebrand factor 90 min after treatment were significantly lower (p less than .001) in the DDAVP group as compared with the placebo group. We conclude that the administration of DDAVP in patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery does not reduce total blood loss and is only effective in reducing intraoperative bleeding.\r"

Angiographic graft patency data were obtained within 60 days of surgery. Analysis of early graft patency in 555 patients (1781 grafts), revealed the following graft patency rates: aspirin daily, 93.5%; aspirin three times daily, 92.3%; aspirin and dipyridamole, 91.9%; and sulfinpyrazone, 90.2%. All aspirin-containing therapeutic regimens improved (p less than .05) graft patency compared with placebo (85.2%). Chest tube drainage measured within the first 35 hr after CABG revealed that the median loss with aspirin daily (965 ml), aspirin three times daily (1175 ml), and aspirin plus dipyridamole (1000 ml) exceeded (p less than .02) that with placebo (805 ml), while median loss with sulfinpyrazone (775 ml) did not. The reoperation rate was greater (p less than .01) in all the treatment groups that received aspirin (6.5%) compared with the two nonaspirin groups (1.7%). Overall operative mortality was 2.3%, without significant differences among treatment groups. Transient renal insufficiency occurred in 5.3% of patients taking sulfinpyrazone. Thus, early vein graft patency was improved after CABG with all aspirin-containing drug regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the time course and extent of regression of myocardial hypertrophy after removal of the inciting hemodynamic stress, 21 patients with either aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency were studied preoperatively, after an intermediate period (1.6 +/- 0.5 years), and late (8.1 +/- 2.9 years) after aortic valve replacement, and results were compared with those in 11 control patients. After aortic valve replacement there was significant hemodynamic improvement, with a fall in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (164 +/- 73 to 105 +/- 35 ml/m2, p less than .01), a fall in left heart filling pressure (19 +/- 9 to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than .01), and maintenance of the cardiac index (3.3 +/- 0.8 to 3.5 +/- 0.8 liters/min/m2, NS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (60 +/- 13% to 64 +/- 10%, NS). By the late study the cardiac index (4.0 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2, p less than .01) and left ventricular ejection fraction (66 +/- 15%, p less than .05) had further increased and were significantly greater than before surgery. For the group as a whole, the left ventricular muscle mass index fell 31% after surgery by the time of the intermediate postoperative study (174 +/- 38 vs 120 +/- 29 g/m2, p less than .01), and a further 13% from the intermediate to the late study (105 +/- 32 g/m2, p less than .05). At the preoperative study left ventricular muscle mass index was greatest in those patients with aortic insufficiency (191 +/- 36 g/m2), and greater in those with aortic stenosis (158 +/- 33 g/m2) than in control subjects (85 +/- 9 g/m2, p less than .05). At the intermediate postoperative study left ventricular muscle mass index remained significantly higher in both those with preoperative aortic insufficiency (128 +/- 29 g/m2) and those with stenosis (114 +/- 27 g/m2) than in the control subjects (p less than .01). By the time of the late postoperative study there were no longer any significant differences in left ventricular muscle mass index. Thus, the regression of myocardial hypertrophy is a process that occurs over many years after correction of the primary hemodynamic abnormality. As this process of myocardial remodeling occurs, continued improvement in cardiac function may occur, and the improvement occurring between the intermediate and late postoperative studies at a slight but constant afterload excess (inherent in the relative stenosis of the aortic prosthesis) suggests that the hypertrophied myocardium is operating at a reduced level compared with normal myocardium.\r"

Each patient received placebo, 30 mg of diltiazem, 10 mg of nifedipine, and 30 mg of diltiazem plus 10 mg of nifedipine four times daily for 1 week each. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by means of a treadmill exercise test. The exercise tolerance time was significantly prolonged from 235.1 +/- 52 (placebo period) to 342.2 +/- 101 sec by diltiazem (p less than .01) and to 325.6 +/- 73 sec by nifedipine (p less than .01).

These data suggest that exercise tolerance in patients with effort angina is increased by the concomitant administration of diltiazem and nifedipine associated with an increase in the nifedipine plasma concentration.\r"

New evidence indicates that the components of the renin-angiotensin system are synthesized in cardiovascular tissues, that the synthesis of these components can be modulated by pharmacologic agents, and that angiotensin II, the effector protein of the renin system, appears to be capable of producing hypertrophy or hyperplasia in specific tissues. In addition, recent studies suggest the participation of enhanced proto-oncogene transcriptional activity in the development of hyperplasia and hypertrophy in cardiovascular tissue. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that angiotensin and perhaps other components of the renin system can be viewed as locally active growth factors capable of acting in a fashion similar to that associated with cytokines in other systems.\r"

  ".W": "The emerging recognition of the existence and potential biological significance of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems in a number of organs has fostered interest in a possible intrinsic cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Evidence for such a system was first provided by biochemical measurements of components of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiac tissue. It has recently been demonstrated that the genes coding for renin and angiotensinogen are expressed in all regions of the heart, an essential prerequisite for the postulated intracardiac biosynthesis of these proteins. Moreover, we have shown the presence of a functional and physiologically active pathway for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the beating mammalian heart. This conversion appears to be catalyzed by a specific cardiac converting enzyme that is susceptible to systemically administered converting-enzyme inhibitors. Evidence for the physiologic importance of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system comes from experimental data as well as indirect clinical evidence. The potent coronary vasoconstrictor properties of angiotensin II underscore its possible significance in myocardial ischemia and ischemic heart disease, in particular when viewed in the context of selective local activation. The long-known positive inotropic effects of angiotensin II are based on its direct myotropic properties and on its facilitatory effects on sympathetic neurotransmission and may be of added significance in metabolically compromised states. We have recently demonstrated that locally generated angiotensin may be a dominant etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of reperfusion arrhythmias. In addition, we have found experimental evidence for a deleterious effect of angiotensin II on myocardial metabolism in the setting of regional myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Drug concentrations of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were equipotent in their effect on angiotensin I pressor response. Concentrations of the other compounds were equimolar with respect to the sulfhydryl group. Hearts treated with captopril, its isomer, zofenoprilate, cysteine, and glutathione showed significant increases in coronary flow by 5 min of perfusion. In contrast, ramiprilate treatment resulted in a slower increase in coronary flow that was only significant after 20 min of perfusion. The effect of ramiprilate was associated with a significant increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha overflow in the coronary effluent compared with that in saline-treated hearts, whereas captopril and glutathione had no significant effect on overflow of the measured cyclooxygenase products 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane B2, and PGE2. The effects of captopril, zofenoprilate, and glutathione on coronary flow were dose dependent. These results corroborate the view that ramiprilate enhances coronary flow by affecting prostacyclin synthesis, mediated by an increase of endogenous bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The abilities of angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to suppress superoxide anion formation in vitro and to improve postischemic cardiac function in vivo were examined. Three sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors, captopril, its stereoisomer SQ 14,534, and an analog, zofenopril (SQ 26,703) were compared with enalaprilat and teprotide, which lack the sulfhydryl group but inhibit ACE, and two compounds, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which contain a thiol moiety but are not ACE inhibitors, for suppression of free radical formation in vitro. The autooxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome is mediated by superoxide anions and inhibited by captopril, SQ 14,534, and zofenopril, with similar IC50 values of 8 to 10 microM, but not by enalaprilat or teprotide (IC50 greater than 1000 microM). This reaction is also inhibited by MPG and NAC with IC50 values of 19 and 17 microM, respectively. In addition, captopril, MPG, or NAC, but not teprotide or enalaprilat, scavenge superoxide anion production by the purine-xanthine oxidase reaction and by canine neutrophils activated with phorbol myristate acetate. These results indicate that captopril scavenges superoxide anions in vitro independent of an action on ACE, which is probably related to the presence of a sulfhydryl moiety. Myocardial segmental function in the anesthetized, open-chest dog is altered during ischemia from active shortening to passive lengthening. Reperfusion after 15 min of ischemia does not restore active shortening within a 3 hr experimental period. Pretreatment of dogs with captopril intravenously (5 mg/kg) results in a 40% to 60% return to active shortening within 60 min of reperfusion. In contrast, equihypotensive doses of enalaprilat do not improve segmental function during reperfusion. Dogs given captopril immediately before restoring coronary blood flow show a similar return of function as that observed in animals treated with the drug before occlusion. SQ 14,534, the isomer of captopril, which is 100-fold less potent as an ACE inhibitor but equipotent in scavenging superoxide anions, also improves reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction when administered at reperfusion (5 mg/kg). Thus captopril improves postischemic contractile derangements by a mechanism independent of ACE inhibition. Restoration of blood supply to the ischemic myocardium provokes ventricular fibrillation in 37.5% of control dogs but in only 9% of those administered enalaprilat and 0% of captopril-treated animals. SQ 14,534 does not reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (40%), indicating that the antifibrillatory actions may be related to ACE inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Recent data demonstrate that renin and angiotensinogen genes and their products are expressed at many local tissue sites. The concept that multiple tissues synthesize angiotensin has changed our understanding of the physiology of the renin-angiotensin system. These potential autocrine-paracrine systems may be important in the regulation of local tissue functions in addition to the circulating endocrine system. The activity of the tissue system under different conditions can influence the pharmacologic response to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. For example, evidence suggests that tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) may be the primary site of action of ACE inhibitors. Consequently, the duration of action of an ACE inhibitor may be more dependent on the duration of tissue ACE inhibition than on the drug's serum half-life. The differential effects of these pharmacologic inhibitors on the tissue renin-angiotensin systems may form the basis of differentiation between the various ACE inhibitors.\r"

Angiotensin-containing pathways within brain areas involved in central blood pressure regulation have been described. Evidence from biochemical, neurophysiologic, pharmacologic, and most recently, molecular genetic studies indicate that the brain RAS is regulated independently of the hormonal RAS and may contribute to blood pressure control and body fluid homeostasis. In addition, circulating angiotensin II can exert some of its action through stimulation of brain angiotensin receptors accessible from the blood. In experimental animal preparations of hypertension, especially in spontaneously hypertensive rats, an overactive brain RAS may be one of the factors involved in pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, inhibitors of the angiotensin II-generating converting enzyme (CE) have been shown to lower blood pressure by a central action when applied to the brain and to inhibit brain CE when applied systemically. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying a particular cardiovascular disease and the characteristics of the CE inhibitor used (e.g., its lipid solubility governing penetration into tissue) may determine the degree to which CE inhibition within a given organ, such as the brain, contributes to the action of these drugs.\r"

The availability of effective blocking agents, converting-enzyme inhibitors, has made it possible to further elucidate important functions of the extrarenal RAS. We have found that the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril shifts the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation to lower blood pressure levels in normotensive and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This effect may explain our finding of a remarkable preservation of cerebral blood flow, despite significant blood pressure reduction, in patients with chronic heart failure. We suggest that the effect of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition on autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is mediated by a dilatation of larger cerebral arteries, which results from inhibition of the vascular tone normally maintained by locally produced angiotensin II.\r"

When studies were performed in individuals on a high-salt diet, normal subjects showed little or no response, whereas a substantial number of patients with essential hypertension displayed an increase in renal blood flow with these agents, a qualitative difference. The individuals that show this potentiated response we now are coming to recognize, have a number of features that suggest a distinct subgroup, the \"nonmodulators.\" Normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients show a directionally similar but smaller renal vascular response to converting-enzyme inhibition. These hypertensive patients also show a blunted natriuresis in response to a sodium loading, which is corrected by converting-enzyme inhibition. Several lines of evidence suggest that the locus of action is intrarenal rather than systemic. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration are not higher in these subjects, and thus cannot account for their potentiated response to converting-enzyme inhibition. Moreover, the infusion of captopril directly into the renal artery in doses far too low to induce a systemic effect increases renal blood flow specifically in these subjects. They also show a blunted rate of renin suppression after a sodium load, although plasma renin activity falls to the same low level at steady state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They utilize all the critical binding interactions of the substrate and convert the catalytic interaction with the zinc atom into an effective binding interaction. Three chemical classes of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors have been introduced into clinical use, the sulfhydryl-containing inhibitors such as captopril and its analogs and prodrugs, carboxyalkyldipeptides such as enalapril and its analogs, and phosphorus-containing inhibitors such as fosinopril and the phosphonate SQ 29,852. Within each of the three groups of inhibitors significant differences in molecular weight and polarities can be observed. These differences have a significant influence in the routes of elmination and tissue distribution of these inhibitors. Tissue distribution and intrinsic potency will determine the magnitude of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition at the tissue level, which could play a critical role in the clinical utilization of these inhibitors. The sulfhydryl-containing inhibitors such as captopril undergo a metabolic process significantly different from that of the other two classes. They can interact with endogenous sulfhydryl-containing compounds like glutathione and proteins, to form reversible disulfides, which can serve as depot forms of the drug. Also, because of their redox properties they might function as recyclable free radical scavengers.\r"

From these results we conclude that ultrasound and UGFNAB are of considerable value in staging head and neck malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Autogeneic bone grafts--26 femoral heads, four femoral and two iliac bone grafts--were used in 32 total hip arthroplasties, mainly on patients with complete dislocation of the hip, to reconstruct deficiencies of the acetabular roof by a standardized procedure. At the follow-up examination after 24 to 101 months (median, 52 months), roentgenography demonstrated lateral resorption of the graft in 20 of 32 hips, but resorption involved bone support of the socket in only three of the hips. Analysis of serial roentgenograms showed that resorption was not a function of time. Complete incorporation of the grafts was observed in 27 hips; partial incorporation was shown in three. Roentgenographically, two grafts were not incorporated. None of three grafts of a cortical nature was incorporated. Graft uptake of radioactive tracer was found by 99mTc-diphosphonate emission scintigraphy in 16 of 21 hips, but did not correlate with progressive bone resorption, nonunion, or loss of bone structure. High quality serial roentgenograms showing good bone detail provided the best information about the integrity of the acetabular roof reconstructions.\r"

If adequate attention is paid intraoperatively to patellar tracking and component position, the incidence of subluxation, component loosening, and fracture should decrease. When treating patellar subluxation and dislocation, tibial tubercle transfer should be avoided because there is an unacceptably high incidence of complications. Care should be taken to treat the underlying cause of dislocation with either a soft tissue procedure or component revision. Fracture of the patella may be treated nonoperatively in 50% and 80% of patients. Cysts, if large, may be bone-grafted to avoid the potential complications of stress fracture and component loosening. Loosening of the patellar component is likely to be symptomatic and to require surgery in up to 75% of cases. A displaced patellar component may cause attritional wear of the quadriceps tendon or patellar ligament. All rheumatoid patellae should be resurfaced. The present trend in the osteoarthritic patella is toward resurfacing more often. With improved implant design and a predicted decrease in complications, resurfacing in the osteoarthritic patella may become routine. Osteoarthritic patellae that maintain good cartilage, normal anatomic shape, and congruent tracking need not be resurfaced.\r"

  ".W": "The newest knowledge on the osteoclast allows us to consider bone resorption in a global perspective, as the resultant of three successive steps that may each be individually regulated by physiopathologic or pharmacologic agents. The first involves the formation of osteoclast progenitors in hematopoietic tissues followed by their vascular dissemination and the generation of resting preosteoclasts and osteoclasts in bone. The second consists in the activation of osteoclasts at the contact of mineralized bone. Osteoblasts appear to control this step by exposing the mineral to osteoclasts and preosteoclasts and/or by releasing a soluble factor that activates these cells. In a third step, activated osteoclasts resorb both the mineral and the organic of mineralized bone through the action of agents that they secrete in the segregated zone underlying their ruffled border. The mineral appears to be solubilized by hydrogen ions secreted by an ATP-driven proton pump located at that border and fed by protons generated from CO2 by carbonic anhydrase. The removal of organic matrix, which could be prepared by osteoblast collagenase at the level of nonmineralized bone surfaces, appears dependent on acid proteinases, particularly cysteine-proteinases, secreted, together with other lysosomal enzymes, in the acid microenvironment of the resorption zone.\r"

  ".W": "Except after trauma resulting in an intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck or dislocation of the hip, the causes of pathogenesis in osteonecrosis of the femoral head have yet to emerge. The circulation to the femoral head may be impaired severely following a traumatic episode. Staging of the pathologic process is important as the selection of the appropriate surgical treatment depends upon the stage at the time of diagnosis. Anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms are sufficiently accurate to make the diagnosis in Stages II to V. Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are prescribed when roentgenograms are consistent with Stage II disease. This recommendation is made because subtle changes may be present that are not apparent on the roentgenogram, such as fracture of the surface or beginning segmental collapse. These changes would change the classification to Stage III rather than Stage II. MRI or core biopsy is required for diagnosis in Stage I. Many surgical treatment options have been proposed for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. No one operation has been shown to be superior. Most papers do not have sufficient long-term follow-up evaluation or a significantly large number of cases to allow one to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of the operation. Total hip replacement or hip arthrodesis is the treatment of choice for the end stages of the disease when the hip joint has degenerated.\r"

Subsequent anteromedial migration of the socket and thread laceration of the common femoral artery resulted in a pseudoaneurysm and massive pelvic erosion seven months later. Vascular reconstruction and excisional arthroplasty were necessary. Later, gracilis and gluteal muscle flaps were swung to fill the resultant pelvic cavity. The hip was nonreconstructable. Ten months later the wound healed and the patient was ambulating in a walker. This represents a previously unreported cause of vascular injury complicating total hip arthroplasty (THA). A comprehensive review of the English and European literature illustrates the various mechanisms of vascular trauma in this setting and provides a rational basis for prevention.\r"

Twins are also more prone to birth asphyxia, hyaline membrane disease, respiratory disorders, and seizures. Congenital anomalies and nonrespiratory morbidity were not found to be increased in twins. Twins have a six times higher perinatal mortality rate than do singletons. This is accounted for by prematurity in the main. A part of the excess mortality in twins is accounted for by a higher mortality in larger, near-term twins. Efforts should be directed toward decreasing the incidence of prematurity in twins and understanding and managing the problems of near-term twins better.\r"

Monochorionic twins have higher rates of perinatal mortality, intrapair birth weight discrepancies, and intrauterine growth retardation than dichorionic twins, which suggests that these complications may be related to placental vascular anastomoses. Monochorial vascular communications also can be responsible for twin transfusion syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation at birth and disruptive structural defects. Followup studies indicate that twins remain at a disadvantage for subsequent physical growth and intellectual achievement. The management of twins is challenging and fascinating because of the wide range of perinatal, neonatal, developmental, and parenting problems that can occur.\r"

Unfortunately, it is clear that little progress has been made over the past two decades in either the prevention or the treatment of premature labor in twins. The clinician is left with more questions than answers. This latter aspect needs to be recognized by the legal profession. Obviously, more studies regarding the possible beneficial effect of either bedrest or prophylactic beta-sympathomimetics are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made on a universal basis. It is also obvious that more potent tocolytic agents are needed to actually treat premature labor once it occurs. Taking all of these facts into consideration, the authors would recommend the protocol outlined in Table 3 for the general management of twins with regard to premature labor.\r"

Four anesthetized primates received an LD100 iv infusion of Escherichia coli over one hour. Plasma concentrations of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and anti-LPS IgG, and viable E. coli colonies in circulating whole blood samples were determined at specified intervals. Plasma antiendotoxin IgG concentration was determined by an enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay, and viable bacterial counts were assayed by standard plate count techniques. LPS concentration increased during E. coli infusion to a mean of 1.13 +/- 0.068 ng/ml (p less than .001) with a concomitant decrease in the concentration of anti-LPS IgG to 59 +/- 5% of control values (p less than .005). Viable circulating E. coli colonies increased during the infusion to a maximum of 425 X 10(6) cfu/ml 10 min after the completion of the infusion, but fell precipitously 20 min later to 10.1 X 10(6) cfu/ml. When each animal succumbed, their respective plasma LPS concentrations were still raised, whereas no viable circulating E. coli colonies were present at a dilution of 10(2). Elevated plasma LPS could prove to be a significant circulating pathogen during Gram-negative bacterial shock and supports the possible association between plasma LPS and morbidity, and mortality in septic shock.\r"

Major technologic advances prolong life but often provide questionable benefit in human terms. Both the ethical commitment to the individual patient and the competition for access to expensive and scarce health resources prompt the search for clinically useful and operationally appropriate criteria for decision-making. The mnemonic 3 R's and Q.C. was evolved as a practical tool by which the ethical basis for interventions may be tested. The first tier, the 3 R's, is likely to resolve the vast majority of ethical issues. These are appropriately addressed at the bedside by clinicians who determine whether a proposed intervention is Rational, Redeeming, and Respectful. When the ethical issues cannot be resolved at the bedside on the basis of the 3 R's, a second tier of testing of Quality of Life and Cost (Q.C.) is triggered. This addresses decision-making which is not exclusively or even primarily in the skill domain or authority of most physicians. It calls for assistance by those who represent a broader base of societal involvement including multidisciplinary experts in ethics and law who serve as consultants or who are organized into medical center-wide ethics committees.\r"

  ".W": "PEEP can significantly reduce cardiac output. This reduction in cardiac output is frequently attributed to transmission of airway pressure to intrathoracic vascular structures. We designed an acute lung injury (ALI) model in swine (n = 7) characterized by low lung thorax compliance (CLT) and compared the fractional transmission of airway pressure to pleura (PPL) and pericardium (PPC) and hemodynamics to normal animals (n = 5) during controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and PEEP. Fractional transmission of PEEP to PPL and PPC was reduced significantly from 62 +/- 8% and 54 +/- 19 (SD)% to 34 +/- 7% and 36 +/- 9% in normal and ALI animals, respectively. End-inspiration tracheal pressure was significantly higher in the low compliant group; thus, cardiac output was equally depressed in both groups despite reduction in fractional airway pressure transmission in ALI animals, possibly because absolute inspiratory PPL and PPC were similar due to increased pressure required to inflate injured lungs. The results of this investigation do not support the presumption that low CLT blunts hemodynamic consequences of CMV and PEEP.\r"

We studied the effect of submaximal exercise and cold air exposure on bronchial reactivity to methacholine in a normal control group (n = 10) and in subjects with bronchial asthma (n = 17). Bronchial provocation testing was performed to determine the provoking dose (PD35) of methacholine that caused a 35 percent decrease in specific airway conductance (Gaw/VL) in the two groups. Each subject was studied on three different occasions to determine the PD35 to methacholine on a control day, after ten minutes of submaximal exercise, and after a 30-minute exposure to cold air. Methacholine challenge was performed after the Gaw/VL had returned to the baseline values. In the normal group, neither cold air exposure nor exercise challenge had any significant effect on baseline Gaw/VL, whereas in the asthmatic group, both stimuli caused 20 percent and 15 percent decreases in Gaw/VL, respectively (p less than .05). Mean +/- SD control PD35 was 6.1 +/- 11.6 breath units in the asthmatic group, which decreased to 2.2 +/- 2.8 after exercise and 3.0 +/- 5.0 breath units after cold air exposure (p less than .05). In the normal group, control PD35 was 73 +/- 32 breath units, which was not different from PD35 values of 64 +/- 75 and 52 +/- 64 breath units after exercise and cold air exposure, respectively (p = NS). These data suggest that submaximal exercise and cold air exposure enhance nonspecific bronchial reactivity in asthmatic but not in normal subjects.\r"

To clarify these points, 19 patients were compared: ten as a control group and nine who received captopril during two days before surgery. Anesthesia was the same for the two groups, and cardiopulmonary bypass ensured nonpulsatile flow rates. Anesthesia induced a slight decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure of the treated group (91.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg to 83.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg), which did not occur in the control group (89.9 +/- 5.8 mm Hg to 89.7 +/- 4.9 mm Hg). During cardiopulmonary bypass, the mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at comparable levels in the two groups (65.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in the control group, 72.6 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the treated group), with same pump flow rates. After cardiopulmonary bypass, the mean arterial blood pressure returned nearly to prebypass values. Postoperatively, three patients in the control group and four in the treated group developed hypertension. Thus, preoperative renin-angiotensin system blockade by a converting-enzyme inhibitor did not impair blood pressure regulation during anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass, but failed to prevent hypertension following coronary surgery.\r"

We report results obtained by an enzymatic procedure that permits the simultaneous determination of the neuron and nonneuron-specific enolase and the calculation of the ratio of these two components. The utility of this ratio which characterizes elevations of the serum neuron-specific enolase from a poor or rich source of this component was tested in 38 patients with small cell lung carcinoma and in 57 subjects suffering from other bronchogenic cancers. The control group consisted of 37 blood donors and 56 patients with respiratory disease. For the diagnosis, the sensitivity and the specificity of the enzymatically determined neuron-specific enolase compared well with published results obtained by radioimmunoassay and enzymoimmunoassay. The use of the ratio clearly increases the specificity of the test, since only 5.3 percent of false positive results are found when bronchogenic tumors other than small cell carcinoma are studied. The sensitivity was 76 and 100 percent in diagnosis of limited and extensive forms, respectively. The use of this ratio in the follow-up of the patients and for the determinations in hemolyzed samples is set out.\r"

A role for the direct toxicity of the drug is likely because (a) toxicity in part is related to dosage and duration of therapy, (b) many patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have no evidence of an inflammatory or immune response in the lung, (c) in vitro studies indicate that amiodarone can be directly toxic to cultured lung cells or perfused isolated lung tissue, and (d) recent studies suggest plausible biochemical mechanisms that may explain in part the mechanism(s) of direct toxicity of the drug. A role for indirect inflammatory or immune processes within the lung of some patients with APT is supported by: (a) variable relationship of pulmonary toxicity to amiodarone dosages and blood levels, (b) preliminary studies suggest altered immunologic markers in the blood and lungs of some patients with APT, and (c) the cellular findings of bronchoalveolar lavage indicating a CD8 lymphocytosis with or without influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which is consistent with previous studies of hypersensitivity reactions. As our understanding of the biochemical and cellular mechanisms of APT improve, a number of key clinical issues may be clarified: (1) risk factor assessment for APT, (2) criteria for early diagnosis of APT, and (3) improved therapeutic approach to patients with APT.\r"

  ".W": "The availability of calcium antagonists has provided yet another therapeutic option in the management of hypertension. Calcium antagonists lower the blood pressure in hypertensive individuals while preserving the blood flow at the microcirculatory level. While all the available calcium antagonists are effective in the treatment of hypertension, they differ in their hemodynamic and pharmacologic actions. Nifedipine appears to be suitable for immediate treatment of severe hypertension and for chronic treatment of uncomplicated or refractory hypertension. In some but not all patients, co-administration of a beta-blocker is necessary to blunt reflex tachycardia. This problem is less likely with the tablet/long-acting formulation of nifedipine. Verapamil and diltiazem are useful as initial therapy for chronic mild-to-moderate hypertension. They are as effective as other first-line drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. The heart rate with verapamil or diltiazem does not change or is slightly reduced, thus contrasting with nifedipine. Experience to date suggests that calcium antagonists do not cause adverse biochemical effects and in this respect are superior to diuretics and certain beta-blockers. Currently, verapamil is available as a sustained release preparation. In the near future, nifedipine or diltiazem may also be available in the long acting formulation to permit simplicity and to enhance patient compliance in the treatment of hypertension.\r"

Oral administration of 400 mg of sodium taurocholate caused a rise in plasma beta-END-LI from 9.9 +/- 0.5 pmol/liter to 21.3 +/- 1.2 pmol/liter after 30 min and 18.1 +/- 0.5 pmol/liter after 60 min, with return to the initial value after 90 min.

Oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) increased plasma beta-END-LI from 7.3 +/- 0.3 pmol/liter to 30.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/liter after 30 min. In gel chromatography, the beta-END-LI released after UDCA administration separated into two components, which eluted in the same positions as human beta-lipotropin and human beta-endorphin, respectively.

The time course of pancreatic juice, protein, amylase, and trypsinogen secretion in response to cerulein or carbamylcholine in diabetic rats was similar to that in control rats. Basal as well as cerulein- or carbamylcholine-stimulated output of amylase from diabetic rat pancreas was significantly reduced, whereas that of trypsinogen was similar to the control. Amylase and trypsinogen outputs in response to 620 pM (1.0 ng/ml) cerulein from insulin-treated diabetic rat pancreas were significantly lower than those from control rat pancreas, although the pancreatic contents of these enzymes were similar to or greater than those in control rats. The dose-response curves of pancreatic juice, protein, amylase, and trypsinogen for cerulein and carbamylcholine were biphasic in both control and diabetic rats. The minimal and the maximal release in response to cerulein occurred with higher concentrations in diabetic rats compared with control rats. In contrast, the maximal responses were obtained with 1 microM carbamylcholine in control rats and with 0.1-1 microM carbamylcholine in diabetic rats. The present study demonstrates that the concentration of cerulein required to elicit maximal response was increased, whereas that to carbamylcholine was reduced in diabetic rat pancreas, and that the protein and enzyme outputs in response to cerulein were significantly reduced in insulin-treated diabetic rat pancreas despite restoration of the pancreatic enzyme contents to control levels.\r"

While the intestinal concentrations varied widely among species, pancreatic IR-7B2 concentrations appeared to be similar in all four species. In the rat, pancreatic islets were found to contain high concentrations of IR-7B2 (5.73 +/- 0.14 fmol/islet, mean +/- SEM). Neonatal capsaicin treatment and enteric nerve section did not affect the concentrations of IR-7B2 in the rat intestine. Layer separation of human gut showed that IR-7B2 is mainly (71 +/- 8%) present in the epithelial fraction. Chromatographic analysis of intestinal and pancreatic extracts from the four species on Sephadex G-100 showed the presence of two immunoreactive peaks at Kav 0.3 and 0.6, but there were both inter- and intraspecies variations in the proportions of the larger and smaller molecular forms.\r"

As compared to normal subjects, patients with chronic pancreatitis showed: (1) significantly higher plasma glucose levels after oral glucose load (area under the plasma glucose curve 1708 +/- 142 vs 1208 +/- 47 mmol/liter X 240 min, P less than 0.005); (2) plasma insulin levels significantly higher at fasting (0.11 +/- 0.008 vs 0.08 +/- 0.005 nmol/liter, P less than 0.01) but not after oral glucose administration (area under the plasma insulin curve 79 +/- 12 vs 88 +/- 16 nmol/liter X 240 min); (3) significantly lower plasma C-peptide concentrations both in the fasting state (0.15 +/- 0.01 vs 0.54 +/- 0.05 nmol/liter, P less than 0.001) and after oral glucose load (area under the plasma C-peptide curve 211 +/- 30 vs 325 +/- 37 nmol/liter X 240 min, P less than 0.05). The finding of diminished plasma C-peptide levels suggests that chronic pancreatitis is associated with an impaired B-cell function even in the absence of overt diabetes. The increased or unchanged plasma insulin levels in spite of decreased plasma C-peptide concentrations indicate that in chronic pancreatitis insulin metabolism is reduced, most likely within the liver.\r"

Complications of ventilatory support include problems associated with short-term and long-term intubation, barotrauma, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and weaning errors. Cardiac tachyarrhythmias can arise from a patient's intrinsic cardiac disease, as well as from drug therapy itself. Hemodynamic monitoring is crucial to careful patient management, but it is associated with technical complications during insertion such as pneumothorax, as well as interpretive errors such as those caused by positive end-inspiratory pressure. Acute renal failure can develop as a result both of therapy with drugs such as aminoglycosides and hypotension of many etiologies, as well as the use of contrast media. Nosocomial infection, which is a dreaded complication in ICU patients, usually arises from sources in the urinary tract, bloodstream, or lung. Complications frequently can arise if the interactions of drugs commonly used in the ICU are not recognized. Further, the ICU patient is subject to nutritional complications, acid base problems, and psychological disturbances. This monograph deals with the frequency, etiology, and prevention of these common ICU complications.\r"

Data analysis indicated no significant cardiovascular or subjective effects due to PPA. Caffeine, however, was associated with statistically reliable though clinically insignificant changes from baseline diastolic blood pressure in both supine and standing positions. The rank order of the change indicated larger increases for the subjects who received caffeine, either alone or in combination with PPA, as compared with those who received PPA alone or placebo. No statistically significant differences between PPA and placebo were observed. Subjects in the heavier weight categories had higher blood pressure levels throughout the session as compared with those of normal weight. There was no difference among the study groups in subjective effects. These results provide evidence supporting the safety of currently recommended doses of sustained-release PPA, either alone or in combination with small doses of caffeine in healthy individuals.\r"

This concept certainly holds true in the intensive care nursery; however, the intensity of monitoring in this setting provides opportunities for far broader applications of the information obtained from drug concentration monitoring. This review provides an overview of the complexity of and potential applications for therapeutic drug monitoring in neonates based on literature and clinical experience.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogens stimulate the in vivo proliferation of epithelial cells of the mouse uterus. The cumulative evidence from several earlier studies suggests that the mitogenic effect of estrogens is mediated indirectly through a polypeptide growth factor. The primary focus of the present investigation was to determine whether an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related polypeptide originates in the uterus of the immature or adult mouse under normal or altered estrogen status. Hybridization experiments revealed the presence of the 4.7-kilobase prepro-EGF mRNA in uteri of immature CD-1 mice. The level of this mRNA was augmented at least 2-fold in immature mice treated for 4 days with estrogen, but levels remained markedly low compared to those in submaxillary gland or kidney. Two preparations of pooled uterine luminal fluid from estrogen-treated immature mice contained EGF immunoreactivity (1.2 and 1.7 ng/ml) that was stable in response to acid (50 mM acetic acid) and heat. Negligible EGF (less than 20 pg/uterus) was detected in acid extracts of uteri from ovariectomized or cycling adult mice. After injection of 17 beta-estradiol (0.2 or 2.0 micrograms, ip), the levels of acid-extractable uterine EGF in ovariectomized adult mice up to 48 h after treatment were not different from those obtained with vehicle alone. Immunolocalization of EGF in the mouse uterus was demonstrated only after paraffin sections were first briefly treated with pronase. Staining was observed along the borders of luminal and glandular epithelial cells, especially at the apical region of the cells. Some staining was also observed in the myometrium; stromal cells were negative. Synthesis of the reactive material was apparently estrogen independent, since localization was retained in uteri of both ovariectomized and immature mice. Immunoblots of preparations of membranes from uterine homogenates or epithelial cells revealed a band at mol wt of about 130,000, which, along with other findings of the present study, suggests that EGF occurs predominantly as the membrane-bound precursor form in this organ, as has been previously shown for the kidney. Although the biological role of the precursor in the uterus is not known, we speculate that estrogens function in an autocrine circuit by stimulating processing of the membrane-bound EGF precursor. EGF elaborated by this mechanism might conceivably react with known complementary receptors on uterine epithelial cells to stimulate proliferation.\r"

Using immunohistochemical techniques, calbindin-D9k was localized to the uterine (luminal) epithelium of pregnant rats, but not present in the uterine epithelium of nonpregnant rats. Calbindin was found also in the uterine smooth muscle and endometrial stromal cells of pregnant animals. These latter localizations were reproduced in uteri of 21-day-old nonpregnant rats by administration of tamoxifen or physiological doses of estrogens. Estrogen and tamoxifen produced half-maximal increases of uterine calbindin at daily doses of 0.1 and 10 micrograms, respectively, and maximal responses at 0.3 and 40 micrograms/day. Testosterone and progesterone, at doses which increased the growth of the uterus, did not induce calbindin-D, and both hormones blocked estradiol's effect on uterine calbindin-D appearance. The epithelial localization of calbindin in pregnant uteri was not reproduced in nonpregnant animals by either estradiol (3 micrograms/day) or progesterone (1 mg/day). The localization of calbindin in uterine epithelium during pregnancy appears to be dependent upon an as yet unknown factor. In view of the large surface area of the luminal epithelium in pregnant animals, and the pregnancy-related expression of calbindin in these cells, we propose that uterine epithelium plays an important role in transport of calcium during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations suggest a role for interleukin-1 (IL-1), a polypeptide product of macrophage/monocytic cells, in the immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet beta-cells observed in type 1 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of IL-1 on both alpha- and beta-cell secretory functions in rat islet cell monolayer cultures. Insulin release was 97% inhibited after 6 h of incubation in RPMI-1640 medium (11 mM glucose) containing 1 U/ml IL-1 and 96% inhibited after 24 h of incubation in medium containing 0.1 U/ml IL-1. The cell content of insulin in the monolayers was decreased by 66% (P less than 0.01) after 4 days of incubation in 10 U/ml IL-1; however, after a further 8-day incubation in IL-1-free medium, cell insulin content recovered fully. In contrast, cell glucagon content was decreased by 77% (P less than 0.001) after 4 days of incubation in 10 U/ml IL-1 and did not recover after a further 8-day incubation in IL-1-free medium. After an 18-h preincubation in medium with 0.1 and 1 U/ml IL-1, insulin release responses to 16.7 mM glucose were abolished in 4-h incubations, whereas responses to 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were normal, and after a further 2 and 5 days of incubation in IL-1-free medium, insulin responses to 16.7 mM glucose recovered fully. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of 16.7 mM glucose on glucagon release was lost after an 18-h preincubation in 0.1 and 1 U/ml IL-1, and did not recover fully after 2 and 5 days in IL-1-free medium, whereas the stimulatory effect of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine on glucagon release was not affected by IL-1. We conclude that 1) IL-1 inhibits glucose-dependent and not cAMP-dependent mechanisms of insulin and glucagon release; 2) inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release by IL-1 is reversible, whereas the effect on glucose-modulated glucagon release is not; and 3) IL-1 causes a reversible decrease in the insulin content of islet cells and an irreversible decrease in glucagon content. These actions of IL-1 do not appear to account for the beta-cell-specific destruction of islets characteristic of type 1 diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine GH is a potent stimulant of lactation, and the insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and -II) are believed to mediate GH's growth-promoting actions. Since all of IGF's known actions are mediated through its receptor subtypes, we analyzed the distribution of IGF receptor subtypes in lactating and nonlactating bovine mammary tissue. Analysis of competition curves showed that IGF-I had greater potency than IGF-II in competing with [125I]IGF-I for binding to membranes prepared from both lactating and nonlactating animals. An insulin concentration of 4 micrograms/ml displaced less than 40% of the [125I]IGF-I bound to membranes prepared from both lactating and nonlactating animals, indicating that a high percentage of [125I]IGF-I was bound to the type II receptor. Lactation was associated with an increase in the total amount of [125I]IGF-I bound, and this change was due to an increase in binding to both receptor subtypes. Specifically, membranes prepared from lactating animals had a 3-fold increase in binding competed for by insulin and a 2-fold increase in binding not competed for by insulin. Affinity cross-linking of [125I]IGF-I to membranes prepared from both lactating and nonlactating animals, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography, showed that 260K and 135K bands were present. Competition experiments indicated that unlabeled IGF-I effectively competed for binding to the 260K band, whereas insulin did not. Binding to the 135K band could be inhibited by both IGF-I and insulin. The intensity of the labeled bands showed that type II receptors were relatively more abundant than type I receptors in membranes from both lactating and nonlactating animals. Membranes prepared from lactating animals showed both 135K and 127K species of the type I receptor, whereas nonlactating animals showed only the 135K band. We conclude that type I and II receptors are present in bovine mammary tissue, and type II predominate. Lactation is associated with increases in the concentration of both receptor subtypes, especially type I receptors. Lactation may be associated with structural changes in the type I receptor. These changes in receptor distribution could play a role in modulating the physiological effects of the IGFs on mammary tissue.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies on calcium homeostasis in diabetes, drug-induced diabetic rats have generally been used, and various alterations have been demonstrated in several parameters of the vitamin D-endocrine system. It is, however, still questionable whether the drug-induced diabetic rat is the most appropriate animal model for the investigation of calcium and vitamin D metabolism because of the toxicity of diabetogenic agents toward the principle organs of vitamin D metabolism, such as liver and kidney. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the strain of genetically diabetic mice, C57BL/KsJ db/db, to evaluate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptors in intestine and kidney and to investigate the alterations of calcium and vitamin D metabolism. In both control and diabetic mice, intestinal and renal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors were demonstrated; they had a sedimentation coefficient of 3.4S. The number of specific 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding sites in intestine was 118 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein in diabetic mice, significantly lower than the value of 199 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein in controls (P less than 0.01). Moreover, the renal concentration of specific 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding sites of 34.6 +/- 7.1 fmol/mg protein in diabetic mice was also significantly reduced compared to the value of 63.3 +/- 5.7 fmol/mg protein in controls (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of intestinal and renal receptors between control and diabetic mice. Significant hypocalcemia was demonstrated in the diabetic mice (P less than 0.01), suggesting the development of a negative calcium balance. Diabetic mice showed a significant decrease in renal 24,25-(OH)2D3 production (P less than 0.02), whereas renal 1,25-(OH)2D3 production was significantly increased in the diabetic group (P less than 0.05) compared to the control value. It is probable from these results that the genetic/endogenous diabetes may be directly associated with the alterations of mineral homeostasis. The altered calcium and vitamin D metabolism in diabetic mice is suggested to be derived, at least in part, from the decreased number of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in both intestine and kidney in the diabetic state.\r"

Bolus injections of cholecystokinin, the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon during saline infusions resulted in prompt elevation of plasma insulin levels (peak values, respectively: 57.8 +/- 14.6 microU/ml, 39.0 +/- 9.8 microU/ml, 60.8 +/- 14.4 microU/ml) but insulin responses after administration of these hormones during galanin infusions were statistically significantly blunted (peak values, respectively: 10.8 +/- 3.5 microU/ml, 3.0 +/- 2.8 microU/ml, 8.8 +/- 2.8 microU/ml). Bolus injection of the gastrin-releasing polypeptide, a neuropeptide, during saline infusions resulted in a peak plasma insulin level of 28.2 +/- 8.6 microU/ml but, during galanin infusions, the maximum level attained was significantly lower at 3.4 +/- 2.0 microU/ml. Similarly, tolbutamide administration during saline infusions elevated plasma insulin levels to a peak value of 28.6 +/- 6.2 microU/ml but during galanin infusions, the peak value seen after tolbutamide administration was 4.8 +/- 1.6 microU/ml. Hence, in the conscious dog, galanin effectively inhibits insulin secretion induced by hormones (cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon), a neuropeptide (gastrin-releasing polypeptide), and a pharmacological agent (tolbutamide). The results from the present and previous studies demonstrate that galanin has a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity on the beta-cell and suggest that it acts on a fundamental step in the insulin secretory process.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin receptors in cultured bovine adrenal cells by binding and cross-linking affinity experiments. At equilibrium the dissociation constant and the number of binding sites per cell for IGF-I were 1.4 +/- (SE) 0.3 x 10(-9) M and 19,200 +/- 2,100, respectively. Under reduction conditions, disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked [125I]iodo-IGF-I to one receptor complex with an Mr of 125,000. Adrenal cells also contain specific insulin receptors with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 10(-9) M. Under reduction conditions [125I]iodo-insulin binds to one band with an approximate Mr of 125,000. IGF-I and insulin at micromolar concentrations, but not at nanomolar concentrations, slightly stimulated DNA synthesis, but markedly potentiated the mitogenic action of fibroblast growth factor. Adrenal cells cultured in a serum-free medium containing transferrin, ascorbic acid, and insulin (5 micrograms/ml) maintained fairly constant angiotensin-II (A-II) receptor concentration per cell and increased cAMP release on response to ACTH and their steroidogenic response to both ACTH and A-II. When the cells were cultured in the same medium without insulin, the number of A-II receptors significantly decreased to 65% and the increased responsiveness was blunted. Treatment of such cells for 3 days with increasing concentrations of IGF-I (1-100 ng/ml) produced a 2- to 3-fold increase in A-II receptors and enhanced the cAMP response (3- to 4-fold) to ACTH and the steroidogenic response (4- to 6-fold) to ACTH and A-II. These effects were time and dose dependent (ED50 approximately equal to 10(-9) M). Insulin at micromolar concentrations produced an effect similar to that of IGF-I, but at nanomolar concentrations the effect was far less. The enhanced steroidogenic responsiveness of IGF-I and insulin-treated cells were related to an enhanced capacity to produce pregnenolone and an increased activity of several steroid hydroxylases. These results indicate that both IGF-I and insulin, acting through their own receptor, play an important role in the maintenance of specific adrenal cell functions. However, at physiological concentrations IGF-I is more potent than insulin.\r"

In the neonate, receptors were localized in the hypertrophic zone between the cartilage canals, a region that develops into a secondary ossification center. In support of this finding, receptors were also localized on monolayer cultures of human infant costal chondrocytes. In 20- and 50-day-old rabbits, receptors were localized on reserve and proliferative chondrocytes in the growth plate. In 50- and 130-day-old rabbits receptors were localized on proliferative chondrocytes in the condylar cartilage. In older (180-day-old) rabbits with closed growth plates, GH receptors could not be detected, even in condylar cartilage. These results support the case for revision of the somatomedin hypothesis to accommodate a direct interaction between GH and receptors on epiphyseal chondrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we have detected perikarya containing mRNA encoding GnRH and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) in rat brains. Synthetic DNA oligomers with sequences complementary to the rat cDNA encoding the GnRH structural region and the GAP structural region were hybridized to formaldehyde-fixed coronal sections. The distribution and number of cells containing GnRH/GAP mRNA were similar to those shown by immunocytochemical studies. The areas in which GnRH mRNA perikarya were shown included the medial septal area, the diagonal band of Broca, the preoptic area, and the anterior hypothalamus. Up to 55 cells were detected in a single 12-micron section containing the diagonal band and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) whereas cell numbers diminished in more caudal regions. In addition, both probes labeled the same cells contained within adjacent sections. We used this technique to examine the effect of estrogen on GnRH mRNA levels in the area of the OVLT of normal and androgen-sterilized female rats, using an estrogen treatment paradigm previously characterized in studies investigating the hypothalamic regulation of negative and positive estrogen feedback. We found that 7 days after ovariectomy, 2 days of estrogen treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the average cellular level of GnRH mRNA in both normal and androgen-sterilized females. Analysis of histograms relating the intensity of labeling to the abundance of cells suggested that a small population of GnRH cells responded to the estrogen treatment. However, we found no evidence for a discrete neuroanatomical segregation of such a subpopulation of GnRH-responsive cells within the area of the OVLT.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactive (IR) POMC peptides have been found in several rat nonpituitary tissues. We found IR-ACTH, IR-beta-endorphin (beta END), and IR-gamma MSH in extracts from the following eight rat nonpituitary tissues, listed in order of decreasing POMC peptide concentrations: testis, duodenum, kidney, colon, liver, lung, stomach, and spleen, but not in adrenal or muscle extracts. Concentrations were very low and ranged from less than 0.00003% to 0.0005% of pituitary levels. In testis, duodenum, and colon, IR-gamma MSH and IR-beta END concentrations were only 5-37% of IR-ACTH levels. Gel filtration chromatography showed that IR-ACTH and IR-beta END coeluted in a major peak of 15,000 daltons, which is slightly larger than expected for a C-terminal peptide containing rat ACTH and beta-lipotropin. There were also a minor higher mol wt peak of IR-ACTH and IR-beta END and a minor IR-beta END peak that eluted in the position of mature beta END. There was no peak of IR-ACTH that corresponded to the size of mature ACTH. To determine whether these nonpituitary tissues also contained a POMC-like mRNA, which would confirm that the peptides were synthesized locally within the tissues, we examined poly(A) RNA prepared from 10 nonpituitary tissues and total RNA from pituitary by Northern blot hybridization for the presence of a POMC-like mRNA with an exon 3 riboprobe. Pituitary contained a single POMC mRNA species of about 1000 nucleotides. A short POMC-like mRNA of about 800 bases was found in all nonpituitary tissues, except spleen and muscle. Compared to POMC mRNA levels in pituitary, the concentration of POMC-like mRNA was 0.5% in testis and 0.03-0.07% in the other tissues. The ratio of POMC-like mRNA to IR-POMC peptide concentrations in nonpituitary tissues was at least 1000 times greater than that in the pituitary. We conclude that the POMC gene is expressed in many nonpituitary tissues and that either the short POMC-like mRNA is translated much less efficiently or POMC peptides are released or degraded much more rapidly in nonpituitary tissues than in the pituitary.\r"

In cultured 18-54,SF and B104 neuroblastoma cells, plasma membrane and cytoplasmic staining corresponding to Golgi apparatus could be seen, consistent with the glycoprotein nature of this receptor. Antibody binding was also seen in the central nervous system, confined primarily to the choroid plexus, and the vascular and ependymal elements. Some staining was seen in the parenchyma of the brain, in addition to binding around nerve sheaths and axon bundles. There were high levels of immunoreactivity in all three lobes of the pituitary, including vascular and cellular elements. In liver, highest levels of immunoreactivity occurred in the sinusoidal cells. In lung, IGF-II receptor immunostaining was seen in the alveoli and around the bronchioles. Staining in kidney was observed in glomeruli, tubules, and Bowman's capsules. Lower levels of immunostaining were seen in skeletal muscle, located primarily around the muscle sheaths. Localization of IGF-II receptor to cells of known function in different tissues will help elucidate the role of this ligand-receptor system in regulating growth and metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "88224882\r", 
  ".W": "The mesangial cells, as part of their smooth muscle cell function, are actively involved in regulating glomerular hemodynamics. Their overlying endothelium is fenestrated; therefore, these cells are directly exposed to plasma substances, including hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). These peptides may contribute to the mesangial sclerosis and cellular hyperplasia that characterize diabetic glomerulopathy. We report herein the characterization of the receptors and the mitogenic effects of IGF-I and insulin on mouse glomerular mesangial cells in culture. The IGF-I receptor was characterized on intact cells. The Kd of the IGF-I receptor was 1.47 X 10(-9) M, and the estimated number of sites was 64,000 receptors/cell. The binding was time, temperature, and pH dependent, and the receptor showed down-regulation after exposure to serum. The expression of the receptor did not change on cells at different densities. The specific binding for insulin was too low to allow characterization of the insulin receptor on intact cells. However, it was possible to identify the insulin receptor in a wheat germ agglutinin-purified preparation of solubilized mesangial cells. This receptor showed the characteristic features of the insulin receptor, including pH dependence of binding and a curvilinear Scatchard plot. The mitogenic effects of insulin and IGF-I on mesangial cells were measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. IGF-I was more potent than insulin. The half-maximal response to IGF-I stimulation occurred at 1.3 X 10(-10) M, and a similar increase with insulin was observed at concentrations in the range of 10(-7) M, suggesting that this insulin action was mediated through the IGF-I receptor. These data show that the mouse microvascular smooth muscle cells of the glomerulus express a cell surface receptor for IGF-I in vitro and that this peptide is a potent mitogen for these mesangial cells. It may, therefore, play a role in glomerular proliferative lesions. The insulin receptor is present in small numbers and does not mediate mitogenesis in mesangial cells.\r"

  ".U": "88224887\r", 
  ".W": "The role of protein kinase C in muscarinic agonist-induced insulin release from rat insulinoma cells was investigated. The dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion by carbamylcholine (carbachol) was associated with dose-dependent increase in the release of 3H-inositolphosphates from prelabeled rat insulinoma cell line (RINr) cells. After preincubation with 32P-orthophosphates, carbachol also evoked a rapid decrease in 32P-labeling of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate with concomitant increase in 32P-labeling of phosphatidic acid. Furthermore, carbachol significantly increased membrane-associated protein kinase C activity with a simultaneous decrease of its activity in cytosol. Although phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), a protein kinase C activator, also stimulated insulin release, insulin secretion induced by concomitant administration of carbachol and PDBu was clearly less than the level expected on the basis of an additive action. Moreover, PDBu significantly inhibited inositolphospholipid turnover stimulated by carbachol. Finally, PDBu inhibited the binding of 3H-scopolamine binding revealed that PDBu decreased the number of muscarinic receptors without altering its affinity. These findings suggest that activation of protein kinase C not only mediates muscarinic stimulation of insulin secretion from RINr cells but also operates a negative feedback mechanism in a signal transduction system, at least in part, via down-regulation of muscarinic receptors.\r"

These vesicles were used as a vehicle to transfer receptors to the insulin receptor-deficient Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. Fusion of control [14C] dioleoylphosphatidylcholine-labeled phospholipid vesicles with MDCK cells was found to be dependent on both the amount of time and the concentration of polyethylene glycol used for fusion. Optimal insulin receptor transfer, as determined by recovery of [125I]insulin binding, occurred when MDCK cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 C in the presence of 15% polyethylene glycol plus receptor-containing vesicles. Scatchard analyses for insulin receptor binding before and after vesicle fusion demonstrated no postfusion alteration in insulin receptor affinity and a 10-fold increase in the number of insulin receptors present in the MDCK cells. Fusion transfer of insulin receptors to MDCK cells rendered the cells sensitive to insulin (10-100 nM) for stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Chloroquine (0.1 mM) was found to block endosomal processing of receptor-bound [125I] insulin within 1 h. These findings indicate that insulin receptors function as dissociable units which can be inserted into target plasma membranes with resultant recoupling to cellular systems.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook a systematic analysis of the structural determinants necessary for ligand recognition by the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor by investigating the binding of semisynthetic insulin analogs to IGF receptors from human placental cell membrane fragments. Analogs were prepared by synthetic and semisynthetic methods. Three groups of insulin analogs were synthesized: the first group contained insulin analogs modified at the amino-terminal position of the insulin A chain and included acetyl-insulin and human proinsulin; the second group included analogs in which B chain residues B26-B30 [despentapeptide insulin (DPI)], B25-B30 (deshexapeptide insulin), and B24-B30 (desheptapeptide insulin) were removed; the third group contained insulin analogs in which B chain residues B26-B30 were removed (DPI) and phenylalanine(B25) substituted with other amino acids, including alanine, serine, leucine, and tyrosine. Half-maximal inhibition of binding of radiolabeled IGF-I to placental cell membrane fragments was used as an index of relative binding affinity (K1/2). To determine further if semisynthetic insulin analogs bound to the type I IGF receptor, placental membrane fragments were affinity labeled with radiolabeled IGF-I in the presence and absence of submaximal concentrations of unlabeled hormone, insulin, or semisynthetic analogs, and the labeled proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Insulin had a 500 times lower affinity for the type I IGF receptor than IGF-I [K1/2 = 140 +/- 69 nM (mean +/- SD)] whereas proinsulin and acetyl insulin had a more than 100 times lower affinity than insulin for this receptor type. Removal of insulin B chain amino acid residues 26-30 (DPI) did not negatively affect the binding of the insulin-derived peptide and actually increased the apparent affinity of ligand-receptor association approximately 2-fold. However, further removal of phenylalanine(B25) (deshexapeptide insulin) and phenylalanine(B24) (desheptapeptide insulin) decreased the binding of ligand to the type I IGF receptor progressively by several orders of magnitude. Substitution of phenylalanine(B25) of DPI with tyrosine, a substitution that actually increased the homology of this analog to IGF-I, resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in the relative apparent affinity of the analog for the type I IGF receptor (K1/2 = 31 +/- 4 nM). On the other hand, substitution of phenylalanine(B25) with alanine, serine, and leucine decreased the relative apparent binding affinity approximately 2- to 8-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cells were treated with semisynthetic human insulin for up to 5 days. Insulin (0.7 nM) stimulated PRL production by 30%, and cortisol (100 nM) suppressed it by 80% in GH3 cells. Insulin (3.5 nM) partially blocked the suppression of PRL secretion induced by up to 100 nM cortisol. Equimolar doses of insulin-like growth factor I failed to consistently stimulate either basal PRL secretion into the medium or cortisol-suppressed PRL in GH3 cells. A 65 nM concentration of insulin-like growth factor I was required to stimulate basal PRL secretion in GH3 cells. Relative levels of PRL mRNA sequences in both GH3 cells and normal rat pituitary cells were stimulated by insulin. When cells were incubated with cortisol (10 nM), PRL mRNA levels were suppressed to 40% of control values. Simultaneous incubation of cells with insulin (3.5 nM) partially reversed the cortisol-induced suppression of PRL mRNA to 60% of control values. The results show that insulin antagonizes cortisol-induced suppression of PRL. Physiological doses of insulin stimulate PRL production and PRL mRNA levels, suggesting a direct effect of insulin on either PRL gene transcription or stabilization of PRL mRNA in these cells.\r"

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) release and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations (Ca2+i) of dispersed cells from the pathological parathyroid glands had right-shifted dependencies on extracellular Ca2+, and exposure to the antibodies rendered both Ca2+i and PTH release almost completely insensitive to changes in ambient Ca2+.

Striated muscle development was further validated by the appearance of cholinergic-nicotinic receptors, as demonstrated by the binding of 125I-alpha bungarotoxin (a-Btx). The effect of various supplements added to the cultures on a-Btx binding was used as a measure of muscle cell differentiation. ECM and serum were essential for myotube formation. Insulin (or IGF-I) and cortisol synergistically caused a 20-fold increase in myogenesis. FGF and EGF were effective only in the presence of insulin and cortisol. The data suggest that: (a) cells, derived from adult pituitary, differentiate, in primary culture, into striated muscle fibers; (b) the induction of this differentiation is multi-factorial; ECM, serum, insulin and glucocorticoids facilitate this myogenesis.\r"

Cycle outcome following this new method has not been directly compared to the traditional, laparoscopic recovery technique. To this end, the authors evaluated multiple parameters in 66 laparoscopic (group A), and 44 transvaginal ova recovery procedures (group B) in patients undergoing IVF-ET. No statistically significant differences could be demonstrated between the groups in all but the rate of ova fertilization. The rate of fertilization was higher in the ova recovered by transvaginal follicle aspiration (59.6 versus 69.2%; P less than 0.01). No difference could be demonstrated between the groups in the other parameters examined, which included the number of ova recovered (5.7 +/- 0.4 versus 6.0 +/- 0.7), ova maturity (87 versus 84% intermediate ova), rate of polyspermic fertilization (3.9 versus 5%), rate of cleavage (88 versus 91%), cleavage stage at transfer (3.7 +/- 0.8 versus 3.5 +/- 0.4 cells per embryo), number of embryos transferred per patient (2.7 +/- 0.1 versus 3.3 +/- 0.2), and pregnancy rates. The potential detrimental effects of general anesthesia and CO2 pneumoperitoneum present during laparoscopy but not ultrasound guided recovery on ova quality may underlie the observed difference in fertilization between the groups.\r"

The 95% confidence limits were 7.7 days before and 7.5 days after mean for the gestational sac diameter, and 5.2 days before and 5.6 days after mean for the crown-rump length.

Six positive sera were tested in 17 experiments, resulting in a fertilization rate of 41% (25/61) versus 84% (36/43) for controls (P less than 0.001). When considered individually, three of six positive sera caused significant inhibition. The only serum that gave complete inhibition had the highest titer for IgG (10,000) and lower IgA (100). Absorption with protein A reduced the IgG titer to less than 10 and removed the fertilization inhibitory activity. These results confirm that sperm antibodies from female sera can inhibit human IVF.\r"

Patients in group 1 (n = 26) utilized urinary LH testing in addition to basal body temperature (BBT) and cervical mucus examinations to time their inseminations, while inseminations in group 2 (n = 94) were timed with only BBT and cervical mucus examinations. The monthly fecundability of patients in group 1 was 0.13, whereas the monthly fecundability of patients in group 2 was 0.11. The mean number of inseminations was 1.4 and 1.6 per cycle for groups 1 and 2, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in regard to the number of cycles required to achieve conception. The use of a urinary LH immunoassay for insemination timing offers no benefit over conventional methods of timing (BBT, cervical mucus) when fresh donor semen is used.\r"

The test uses only one dilution of serum (1/16) and no washing procedures. The test was performed in 361 sera. Comparative studies were conducted with the tray agglutination test (TAT) in 164 sera and with the direct MAR test on semen in 110 cases. In 24 sera with borderline test results, and in 13 sera with discordant findings, evidence of antisperm antibody activity was investigated by means of additional testing, namely, the adenosine triphosphate release cytotoxicity test (ARCT) and the indirect immunobead tests (IB) for IgA and IgM. Using the value of 40% reaction between motile spermatozoa and coated latex particles as the lower limit of significant activity, the indirect SpermMAR test has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 87%. The two false-negative indirect MAR results occurred in cases with IgM, the clinical significance of which is doubtful. Hence, the indirect MAR test appears to be an ideal screening procedure for sperm antibodies in serum since it is easy to perform and sensitive. Considering the false-positive rate of 13%, additional tests should, however, be performed on sera with a reaction of 40% or more in order to assess the relevance of the antibodies as a cause of infertility.\r"

Fourteen women ovulated regularly, 23 ovulated variably, but 11 did not ovulate at all. Fifty-two of the 108 cycles of pulsatile LH-RH therapy alone (15 mu gm per pulse, one pulse every 90 minutes) administered through the subcutaneous route were ovulatory. In patients who did not ovulate on subcutaneous LH-RH, treatment with CC (100 mg per day for 5 days) was added to the LH-RH therapy in an additional 33 cycles, of which 21 were ovulatory. In those who did not respond to the combination of treatments, the same dose of LH-RH was administered intravenously: 14 of 29 cycles of intravenous therapy were ovulatory. The overall cumulative conception rate after 6 months of therapy was 60%. When recalculated for ovulatory cycles alone it was 90%, indicating that failure of ovulation was the only cause of the failure of conception. Analysis of the clinical and endocrine findings indicated that failure to ovulate was associated with obesity and hyperandrogenization. Ten of the 23 conceptions ended in miscarriage, 8 within 4 weeks of ovulation. The authors conclude that infertility in patients with PCOD is not optimally corrected by pulsatile LH-RH therapy.\r"

Results of MRI, U/S, estradiol (E2), and progesterone were obtained from five ovulatory volunteers on days 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the cycle. On U/S, all the women had only one dominant follicle, whereas MRI was able to detect a secondary cohort of follicles in three of five volunteers. Endometrial development on U/S and MRI showed similar patterns of growth with an increase on MRI from 5.8 +/- 1.1 mm on day 4 to a mean peak of 10.3 +/- 1.7 mm on day 24. A distinct feature of MRI was the demonstration of a junctional zone (JZ), which has a pattern of growth that resembles that of the endometrium, with accelerated growth from day 8 to day 16 (5.1 +/- .7 mm to 6.7 +/- .7 mm). The JZ corresponds anatomically to the distribution of the arcuate vessels and may therefore represent changes in blood supply to the endometrium. MRI, similar to U/S, is noninvasive and does not involve any radiation exposure but provides new information on uterine changes in the normal cycle. At present, its clinical applications are limited.\r"

Sixty-one patients (13 type I, 48 type II) were treated with rDNA human insulin (NPH HI with or without regular HI) and 53 were treated with HPI (8 type I, 45 type II). At 6 mo, virtually identical levels of HbA1c (5.2 vs. 5.3%, P = NS) were achieved. However, regular HI was added less often to the treatment regimen in HPI-treated patients (16 vs. 32 patients, P less than .001). Overall, there was no significant increase in proinsulin-specific antibodies in either treatment group. However, 8 of 51 (1 transiently) patients in the HPI group developed low levels of binding of HPI (highest percentage bound was 5%). Two patients in the HI group developed very low levels of HPI binding (1.2 and 1.9%). Binding of HI (greater than 2.4%) was seen in both treatment groups; however, the prevalence of HI binding was less in the HPI group at 6 mo (39 of 60 in HI group vs. 20 of 51 in HPI group, P = .008). Concomitant treatment with regular HI did not affect the prevalence or level of binding of HPI or HI. We conclude that human proinsulin is a weak immunogen when used as the principal insulin agonist and may reduce both the formation of anti-HI antibodies and the need for concomitant therapy with regular HI.\r"

  ".W": "Recently a new peptide, pancreastatin, was isolated from porcine pancreatic extracts. It contains 49 amino acids and shows a structural similarity to chromogranin A, which occurs in secretory granules of the endocrine pancreas. Furthermore, pancreastatin has been found to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion in the perfused rat pancreas. However, its effects under in vivo conditions have never been studied. We have therefore investigated the effects of this peptide on insulin and glucagon secretion in vivo in the mouse. We found that an intravenous injection of pancreastatin (4.0 nmol/kg) lowered basal plasma insulin concentration at 6 min from 55 +/- 8 microU/ml in control mice to 21 +/- 7 microU/ml (P less than .01). The peptide also inhibited the plasma insulin response to both glucose (P less than .01) and the cholinergic agonist carbachol (P less than .001). Furthermore, 2 min after injection of pancreastatin, plasma glucagon concentration had increased to 301 +/- 19 pg/ml compared to 190 +/- 12 pg/ml in control mice (P less than .001). The peptide did not, however, affect the carbachol-induced plasma glucagon response. In addition, pancreastatin induced a transient hyperglycemia. Combined adrenergic blockade by means of a pretreatment of phentolamine and propranolol did not prevent pancreastatin from exerting its effects on plasma insulin levels, whereas the increase in plasma glucagon levels was abolished. Thus, in the mouse, the newly discovered intrapancreatic peptide pancreastatin 1) lowers baseline plasma insulin levels, 2) inhibits glucose- and cholinergically induced insulin secretion, 3) stimulates baseline glucagon secretion, and 4) induces hyperglycemia.\r"

The ICCs were stimulated with 20 mM glucose and subsequently with 10 mM theophylline plus 20 mM glucose as a viability test. Insulin release increased to a detectable level (greater than 0.1 pg.ICC-1.min-1) during glucose stimulation in four of seven of the youngest fetuses. At 17-20 wk the basal rate of insulin release had increased by at least 15-fold above the detection limit (1.5 pg.ICC-1.min-1), and glucose promoted a sustained monophasic response that was on the average 1.6-fold higher than the basal level. The response was significant (P less than .05) in 9 of 13 experiments. With postnatal ICC (gestational age 26-44 wk), an early-phase peak response was observed in 5 of 6 experiments. The mean rates of insulin release after 5-12 min of glucose stimulation were 4.8 pg.ICC-1.min-1 in newborn infants and 2.1 pg.ICC-1.min-1 in 17- to 20-wk fetuses. The corresponding mean relative insulin responses (stimulated to basal) were 3.3-fold (range 1.1-7.5) and 1.6-fold (1.0-3.4), respectively (P less than .05, Mann-Whitney U test). The results suggest that the human fetal pancreas is already responsive to glucose during the first half of gestation, but the biphasic insulin release does not start to mature until the postnatal phase.\r"

[3-3H]glucose was infused before and during a 4-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure in a dosage regimen designed to maintain a constant specific activity. From the disposition of label, the rate of insulin-mediated glucose incorporation into glycogen in the low-storage subjects was one-fourth that of the high-storage subjects (P less than .02). The insulin-mediated increase in muscle glycogen synthase activity in the low-storage subjects was one-fourth that of the high-storage subjects (P less than .05), suggesting the possibility of a causal relationship. In the high-storage but not the low-storage subjects, the rate of glycolysis inferred from the appearance of metabolized tritium in body water exceeded the carbohydrate oxidation rate (P less than .002). This suggests that in these subjects there is a significant fraction of glycolysis that is not oxidized and that this component of carbohydrate metabolism therefore contributes to storage.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to estimate the time course of lysosomal transformations associated with crinophagy, i.e., the degradation of insulin within lysosomes, in the beta-cells of pancreatic islets. Primary and secondary lysosomes were identified in mouse islet beta-cells and subjected to ultrastructural morphometry. Islets from an in situ preparation were compared with isolated islets incubated in vitro. Under the in vitro conditions, the islets were initially exposed to 28 or 3.3 mM glucose for 24 h. Then the glucose concentration was rapidly changed to 3.3 and 28 mM glucose, respectively, and the islets were incubated for up to an additional 24 h. The beta-cell lysosomes were analyzed and related to alterations in insulin biosynthesis and secretion and islet insulin content after the rapid change in glucose concentration. In vivo, the beta-cell lysosomal population was predominantly composed of secondary lysosomes, which frequently contained secretory granule cores. After the initial 24-h period at 3.3 mM glucose, the volume density and the average volume of the secondary beta-cell lysosomes were increased, suggesting increased crinophagic activity. The mean diameter of the primary beta-cell lysosomes was decreased after 24 h at either 28 or 3.3 mM glucose. The change in glucose from 28 to 3.3 mM resulted in alterations in insulin biosynthesis and secretion, leading to an accumulation of insulin within the beta-cells. Lysosomal transformations suggestive of increased crinophagy were observed 24 h after the alteration in glucose concentration. The change from 3.3 to 28 mM glucose resulted in a parallel increase in insulin biosynthesis and secretion without a change in islet insulin content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the presence and potential importance of a more generalized deregulation of immune response in patients with Grave's disease and Hashimoto's disease, sera from 33 patients with Graves' disease and 16 patients with Hashimoto's disease were screened for the presence of anti-insulin antibodies and anti-insulin-receptor antibodies. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to identify the presence of IgG against human insulin. The optical density indicating the presence of IgG against insulin in sera from patients with Graves' disease averaged .172 +/- .024 (mean +/- SE; range .010-.802), compared to the mean normal value of .098 +/- .0009 (range .012-.238) in 33 control subjects. Ten of 33 patients with Graves' disease had values greater than .200, whereas control sera values were less than .200 in all but one case (P less than .005, Graves' sera vs. controls). The sera from patients with Hashimoto's disease had a mean optical density of .110 +/- .016, with 15 of 16 values between .010 and .200. These values were not significantly different from controls with an insulin-binding inhibition assay. Anti-insulin-receptor antibodies were not detected in any of 33 patients with Graves' disease, and cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies were not detected in sera from seven patients with Graves' disease who had insulin-binding antibodies. These data support the hypothesis that the immunologic response in autoimmune thyroid disease may be more heterogeneous and polyclonal than previously believed.\r"

IRI measurement in rats can be made more sensitive, accurate, and practical, as demonstrated by a new modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It is characterized by indirect binding of an anti-insulin antibody by an antiglobulin antibody and uses the principle of competitive saturation. In this ELISA, IRI can be determined in a wide range of concentrations, corresponding to the standards. The standard curve ranges from 100 to 0.049 ng/ml IRI (1 ng/ml approximately 23.4 microU/ml approximately 172 pM rat insulin). The statistical analysis shows between- and within-assay coefficients of variation of less than or equal to 15%.\r"

  ".W": "The BB rat diabetic syndrome has been prevented by various immunosuppressive and reconstitution measures. We observed an effect of multiple blood samplings on diabetes incidence and examined its immunological correlates. Individual litters were divided into two groups; one was sampled and the other was sham sampled as the control group. Sixty-four diabetes-prone and 59 non-diabetes-prone rats were studied. The sampled rats had blood removed at 15 (28% of total blood volume), 30 (30%), 50 (21%), 75 (16%), and 120 days of age. The sham-sampled control rats had blood removed only at 120 days of age. The incidence of diabetes in the sampled group was markedly lower than that of their sham-sampled littermates (22 vs. 78%). This result was associated with a correction of their OX19+ (pan-T-lymphocytes) and W3/25+ (helper/inducer) T-lymphocyte-number defects. An increase in lymphocyte subsets was also seen in the non-diabetes-prone BB rats, significant for all but the OX19+ cells. Islet pathology and pancreatic insulin content were consistent with metabolic outcomes. The effect of blood withdrawal thus has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of both the diabetes syndrome and the lymphopenia of the BB rat. Furthermore, it suggests that a stimulation of lymphopoiesis by blood withdrawal (analogous to that of erythropoiesis) may be a hitherto unrecognized physiological response in normal animals.\r"

  ".W": "Nesidioblastosis, which is the formation of new islets and the differentiation of cells within the islets, represents part of the spectrum of hyperfunctioning states of the islets of Langerhans at the clinical level. Nesidioblastosis in the Syrian golden hamster can be induced by wrapping the head of the pancreas with cellophane tape. Ligation of the duct is not involved, and acinar cell atrophy does not occur. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the induction of nesidioblastosis could be used as a means of reversing streptozocin-induced diabetes. Outbred hamsters (n = 32), 8 wk of age, were rendered diabetic by treatment with 40 mg/kg i.p. streptozocin, administered daily for 3 days. Four days later, 16 animals chosen at random underwent laparotomy with cellophane wrapping of the pancreas. Before surgery, the serum glucose and insulin levels (means +/- SE) in the unoperated control animals (389.0 +/- 18.6, 33.9 +/- 3.8) did not differ from those in the animals awaiting the operation (373.2 +/- 18.6, 37.9 +/- 3.8). After 7 wk, 50% of the operated animals had serum glucose and insulin levels that were normal, compared to only 12% of the unoperated control animals (chi2 = 5.53, P less than .05). Islets from normoglycemic operated animals were characterized by increased numbers, including many small islets, positive immunoreactive insulin staining, and minimal vacuolation of cells. Islets from hyperglycemic operated hamsters and from the unoperated control animals were decreased in number and generally larger in size, demonstrated little or no immunoreactive insulin staining, and exhibited marked vacuolation of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three weeks after the induction of diabetes, plasma cholesterol levels were slightly but significantly increased in diabetic rats compared with control animals, whereas a far more remarkable increase in plasma cholesterol was observed in diabetic rats when fed an atherogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, and 5% lard. Microsomal ACAT activity in intestinal mucosa was three times higher in diabetic than in control rats. However, no significant difference in the enzyme activity could be detected between diabetic animals fed control chow and those fed the atherogenic diet. Furthermore, insulin supplementation given to diabetic rats caused a reduction of enzyme activity to the levels found in control animals. In contrast, cholesterol esterase activity in rat intestinal mucosa was unaffected by either the induction of diabetes or the atherogenic diet feeding. In conclusion, we disclosed that apparent ACAT activity in intestinal mucosa is elevated in STZ-D rats. Therefore, we postulate that enhancement of CoA-dependent cholesterol esterification in the intestine might be one of the major factors responsible for hypercholesterolemia in diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "88225806\r", 
  ".W": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to study temporal development of murine autoantibodies against insulin and both type C and intracisternal type A retroviral antigens. The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model for autoimmune, insulin-dependent diabetes, was compared with a related, but diabetes-resistant, strain, nonobese normal (NON). Similarly, C57BL/KsJ db/db mice (insulin-resistant model of insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity) were compared with diabetes-resistant C57BL/6 db/db mice. NOD mice developed much higher autoantibody titers than did NON mice. Whereas type C autoantibodies in NOD developed to peak titer shortly after mice were weaned, autoantibodies against insulin and p73 (group-specific antigen of the intracisternal type A particle) did not develop until shortly before, or concomitant with, the development of hyperglycemia. Two NOD mice not developing hyperglycemia during the 40-wk study period were distinguished from the mice developing diabetes by a delayed onset of insulin (but not p73) autoantibodies. Our findings suggest that in NOD mice, the appearance of insulin and p73 autoantibodies signifies that extensive underlying necrosis of beta-cells occurred. C57BL/KsJ db/db mice (with extensive beta-cell necrosis and early hyperglycemia) developed much higher autoantibody titers to insulin and p73 than did the diabetes-resistant C57BL/6 db/db mice. However, the presence of autoantibodies in normoglycemic C57BL/KsJ +/db controls demonstrated that elevated autoantibody titers alone were insufficient to produce diabetes in this model. Absorption studies indicated that autoantibodies against p73 recognized a common epitope on insulin and IgE-binding factor. The potential significance of this molecular mimicry is discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of our study was to investigate whether reovirus 1 or reovirus 3, which are known to infect beta-cells and induce autoimmunity in susceptible mice, could alter the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins by human beta-cells and rat insulinoma RINm5F cells. Forty-eight hours after infection of either human beta-cells or RINm5F cells with reovirus 1 or reovirus 3, cytopathic effects were noted. By flow-cytofluorometric analysis, infected RINm5F cells exhibited a seven- to eightfold increase in the surface expression of class I MHC proteins. Upregulation of class I MHC proteins on reovirus 3-infected RINm5F cells was inhibited by 80% after preexposure of the virus to reovirus 3 antiserum. When analyzed by double-indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, human beta-cells infected with reoviruses 1 or 3 also exhibited markedly increased levels of class I MHC proteins. Reovirus infection of human beta-cells or RINm5F cells was not accompanied by the induction of class II MHC proteins. These findings suggest that 1) in addition to direct cytopathic effects, reovirus infection may contribute to beta-cell destruction by increasing expression of class I MHC proteins and therefore reactivity with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes; and 2) some viruses may increase MHC protein expression independent of and before the action of cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor) released by immunoinflammatory cells.\r"

Fifty-seven patients with biopsy-proven primary biliary cirrhosis were randomized to receive either 0.6 mg of colchicine twice daily or an identically appearing placebo. Patients underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation every 3 mo and liver biopsy annually. Differences in mean alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase values between the colchicine and placebo recipients were statistically significant at 4 yr. Differences in mean bilirubin and immunoglobulin M values, although lower in the colchicine group, did not reach statistical significance. In colchicine-treated patients, mean alkaline phosphatase values fell significantly compared with controls, from 281 to 112 IU/L (p less than 0.01). Similarly, mean alanine aminotransferase values fell significantly compared with controls, from 129 to 86 IU/L (p less than 0.05). Bilirubin values remained stable in drug-treated patients, even in those patients with initially elevated bilirubin values, whereas they nearly doubled in subjects receiving placebo. Although biochemical parameters of disease activity improved or stabilized in colchicine-treated subjects, no difference in histologic progression was detected between the two treatment groups. We conclude that colchicine is of clinical benefit to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as judged by improvement in alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities as well as a tendency for stabilization of bilirubin values.\r"

As there are no objective markers of improvement, and because there may be a very large placebo response, potential treatments for IBS are difficult to assess. Probably the only method that can reliably evaluate IBS therapies is the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial. The purpose of this review is to critically examine issues central to establishing the efficacy of treatments for IBS in such trials. These include the definition of IBS, measures of efficacy, the placebo response, trial length, maintaining blindedness, the crossover design, ability to generalize, and statistical considerations. With this background, all published IBS treatment trials are examined. It is concluded that not a single study offers convincing evidence that any therapy is effective in treating the IBS symptom complex. Well-designed and executed IBS treatment trials are urgently needed; suggestions are given for essential features of such trials.\r"

The aim of the present experiments was to investigate the fate and effects of acarbose along the small intestine using a slow-marker perfusion technique. In 8 healthy volunteers, jejunal and ileal loads of acarbose, glucose, and total carbohydrates were determined following a liquid, 400-kcal formula meal containing either 200 mg of acarbose or placebo. Preprandial and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose and several polypeptide hormones were determined. Recovery of acarbose during 4 h was 65% +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM) of ingested dose in the ileum but 94% +/- 9% in the jejunum, indicating that the compound was neither degraded nor absorbed by the intestine to a major degree. After acarbose administration, ileal loads of glucose and total carbohydrates were considerably higher, whereas postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lower when compared with placebo. The retardation of carbohydrate digestion to be inferred from these findings is confirmed by significantly elevated plasma concentrations of enteroglucagon after acarbose administration compared with placebo administration.\r"

Five patients were staged as grade II and five grade III on hepatic histology. None were cirrhotic. as grade II and five grade III on hepatic histology. None were cirrhotic. Controls were nine patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), five with extra hepatic biliary obstruction, 15 with other forms of chronic liver disease and six with normal livers. Bile ducts from the normal subjects and patients with chronic liver disease did not express HLA-DR antigens. In contrast, all 10 of the PSC biopsies showed varying degrees of HLA-DR staining of the biliary epithelium. Expression of DR antigens was also found on the bile ducts of all five patients with extra hepatic biliary obstruction and in six of nine patients with PBC. Expression of HLA class I antigens was seen on the biliary epithelium of all the biopsies examined. Increased numbers of helper and suppressor T-cells were seen in the portal tracts of all the PSC patients. This study has confirmed that aberrant expression of HLA-DR may occur on the biliary epithelium of some, but not all, patients with PBC. In addition, the study has shown that aberrant expression of HLA-DR always occurs in PCS at an early stage of histological liver damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty seven sera (10 without autoantibodies and 37 with different auto-antibodies) were included as controls. By immunoblotting, seven mitochondrial peptides reacting with antimitochondrial antibody positive sera were detected. These were of molecular weight 74 kD, 58 kD, 55 kD, 52 kD, 51 kD, 46 kD, and 43 kD. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera and 71% of antimitochondrial antibody-positive non-primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted with one or more of these peptides, while none of the 47 antimitochondrial antibody negative sera reacted in immunoblotting. The 74 kD band was the most frequently detected (84% of primary biliary cirrhosis and 57% of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the primary biliary cirrhosis sera which failed to react with this peptide, showed a positive reaction with that of molecular weight 52 kD. 67/77 (87%) immunofluorescence antimitochondrial antibody positive sera reacted in the ELISA test (93% of primary biliary cirrhosis and 71% of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the 47 immunofluorescence antimitochondrial antibody negative sera were confirmed negative by ELISA. The ELISA values correlated with the immunofluorescence titres (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Despite continuous infusions the H2-antagonist was less effective during this time. The latter finding raises questions about gastric secretory control during the day when food is eaten.\r"

While both alpha- and gamma-interferon induced expression of Class I antigens, only gamma-interferon induced expression of Class II antigens on hepatocytes in vitro. Recombinant interleukin 2 had no effect on major histocompatibility complex antigen expression. Both Class I and Class II antigens could be detected by indirect immunofluorescence on hepatocytes from patients with various forms of chronic liver disease, regardless of etiology. These findings suggest that gamma-interferon produced by T lymphocytes that infiltrate the liver during the course of chronic hepatitis induces Class II major histocompatibility complex antigen expression and may endow the hepatocytes with the capacity to perform accessory (antigen-presenting) cell functions.\r"

Biopsies were obtained from 25 donor livers immediately prior to implantation and analyzed for adenine nucleotides using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results were correlated with organ histology, transplant function and outcome. Significantly higher concentrations of ATP (4.22 +/- 2.87 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.69 nmoles per mg protein, p less than 0.01), ADP (8.75 +/- 2.96 vs. 4.49 +/- 1.95 nmoles per mg protein, p less than 0.01) and energy charge (0.43 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.02) were found in successful (n = 20) relative to failed (n = 5) livers. No significant differences were found in AMP, xanthine or hypoxanthine for the two groups, although the average values were higher in failed livers. Fifteen recipients with liver ATP concentration above 2 nmoles per mg protein and energy charge above 0.3 recovered well. Five other successful patients with lower ATP concentration (0.70 +/- 0.39 nmoles per mg protein) and energy charge (0.20 +/- 0.03) had postoperative courses complicated by infection or prolonged hyperbilirubinemia. In five patients whose livers failed, all had low ATP content and energy charge. Of these, three received a replacement liver and two died shortly after the transplantation. The study demonstrates a direct correlation between high ATP content and good posttransplant outcome.\r"

The cause of such calcification is unknown, but potential pathogenetic factors include hyperparathyroidism, calcium administered during and following surgery, renal failure, acid-base changes and citrate in fresh frozen plasma. To investigate some of the mechanisms underlying ectopic calcification following liver transplantation, we determined preoperative levels of ionized serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, parathyroid hormone (midmolecule assay) and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D in 20 patients who underwent 24 liver transplants. In addition, these parameters were measured weekly in 15 patients during the first month after liver transplantation. Preoperatively, 5 of the 20 patients had elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone, and 9 others had low levels of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D. After liver transplantation, ectopic calcification was found in seven patients (47%). The organs affected in order of frequency were lungs, liver graft, colon, vascular walls, kidneys, adrenal glands and gastric mucosa. One patient with ectopic calcification of both lungs had markedly restricted pulmonary function as well as radiologic evidence of osteopenia and pathologic fractures of three vertebrae. Postoperatively, increased parathyroid hormone levels were found in all patients who developed soft tissue calcification. Parathyroid hormone levels peaked during the second week after transplantation and were higher at all times compared to subjects without calcification. Five of the seven patients with ectopic calcification had associated renal failure. Individuals who developed calcification had received significantly more fresh frozen plasma, red blood cells and elemental calcium postoperatively, but showed no difference in serum levels of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, total plasma CO2 or phosphate levels when compared to patients without calcification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Purified membranes containing the antigen were treated with various agents which perturb plasma membrane constituents to elute woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen. The products from disrupted membranes were analyzed by sedimentation in sucrose gradients and tested to identify the antigen reactivity. The results indicated that membrane-bound woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen was partially released by 4 M potassium chloride, potassium thiocyanate and guanidine, 6 M urea or 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (pH 13.5), but not in the presence of low concentrations of these reagents or by 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. No more than 15% of the total membrane-associated woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen was eluted by 0.1 N NaOH, which was found to be the most effective eluent among tested agents at the antigen removal. The remaining woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen was resistant to further extraction with sodium hydroxide, as expected for an integral membrane protein. Treatment of the infected membranes with 1% Triton X-100 or 50 mM deoxycholic acid, that solubilize the membrane lipid bilayer releasing most of the integral membrane proteins, resulted in the sedimentation of almost all detectable woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen reactivity with the detergent-insoluble membrane residues, suggesting a firm interaction of the antigen with the plasma membrane matrix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anti-HBc IgM was detected in 50% of the primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 26.5% of the chronic active hepatitis patients, 25% of the chronic persistent hepatitis patients, but in none of the healthy hepatitis B virus carriers. There was no correlation between the presence of anti-HBc IgM and HBeAg, hepatitis B virus DNA, ALT or alpha-fetoprotein levels in either the chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis patients. However, a significantly higher positive rate of anti-HBc IgM was noted in the HBeAg-positive or HBV DNA-positive primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients than in those with negative markers of viral replication, but no correlation was noted between the presence of anti-HBc IgM and serum ALT or alpha-fetoprotein levels in these primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Also, no differences in positivity for HBeAg, HBV DNA or levels of serum ALT were noted when patients with high titers of anti-HBc IgM were compared to those with low titers. Thus, anti-HBc IgM cannot distinguish between HBsAg-positive patients with chronic active hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma, does not correlate with serum ALT or alpha-fetoprotein levels and is only associated with markers for viral replication in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Based on this, anti-HBc IgM appears to have a limited usefulness for diagnosis of either chronic hepatitis B or primary hepatocellular carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Probes were roughly equivalent to the pre-S region, the surface antigen gene, the region containing the enhancer, the x gene and the core antigen gene. We found the core antigen gene to be that most underrepresented in the tumors and speculate that, since cells which express core antigen in the infected liver may be targeted for lysis by the immune system, modifications of the integrated viral DNA which prevent core antigen expression may be selected. Conversely, the region of the genome present in the greatest number of integrations was the surface antigen gene and, because it is known that the major surface antigen promoter is active in the integrated state, we find promoter insertion an attractive hypothesis to explain oncogenesis by hepatitis B virus.\r"

We also assayed gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-complete (carboxylated) protein C in these population by using a monoclonal antibody directed against human protein C, JTC-1, which recognizes the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain-related conformational change induced by metal ions. We demonstrated that the plasma of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma contains considerable amounts of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-incomplete protein C, evidenced by the significantly reduced protein C:gamma-carboxyglutamic acid/protein C:antigen ratios in hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to those seen in normal controls, other liver diseases and other malignant neoplasms (p less than 0.01). In two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with the reduced protein C:gamma-carboxyglutamic acid/protein C:antigen ratios, successful treatment (transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization or lipiodolization of antitumor agent) led to the very rapid normalization of the ratios. Intravenous administration of vitamin K, however, induced no such effects in three other patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with the abnormality. We conclude that the impaired vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma involves not only prothrombin, but also protein C, and that the impairment is not due to vitamin K deficiency.\r"

Surprisingly, alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal throughout the entire course of this patient, whereas the younger sister had elevated levels despite the absence of malignant lesions. Thus, the clinical significance of alpha-fetoprotein remains unclear in both cases. Nocturnal feeding, although performed continuously over the 6 years after the diagnosis, had obviously failed to prevent the development of hepatic tumors in both patients.\r"

Frozen sections of liver cut 10 micron thick were serially extracted to remove all elements of the cells except the intermediate filaments. Parallel sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies to the two main cytokeratins found in bile duct and liver cells. Immunofluorescent antibody and immunogold electron microscopy techniques were used to identify the proteins morphologically. Several new observations resulted from these studies. The pericanalicular sheath of intermediate filaments was visualized using steropairs as an uninterrupted branching tubular structure composed of cytokeratins located in the cell cortex of adjacent hepatocytes. Intermediate filaments in the cell cortex formed a distinct sheet of matted filaments which enveloped the entire hepatocyte. The cortical intermediate filaments were in continuity with the pericanalicular sheath and the filaments located within the cytoplasm. The intermediate filaments are attached to the centrioles and appeared to tent the nuclear lamina-pore complex at points of contact. Monoclonal antibodies to rat liver intermediate filament cytokeratins (CK49 and CK55) each stained intermediate filaments located in the cell cortex, within the cytoplasm and at the nucleus. By immunogold staining, some of the intermediate filament filaments were shown to contain both cytokeratins. Filaments which did not stain were thought to be either actin at the cell periphery or nuclear lamins around the nucleus. It is concluded that the cytokeratins form a specialized framework for the cell cortex, canaliculus, centrioles and the nucleus of hepatocytes. The filaments run continuously throughout the cytoplasm without terminating.\r"

Real-time ultrasonography was performed in 29 patients before surgery, after 7 to 30 days and after 4 to 12 months. Direct visualization of the shunt was achieved in 53.5% of the patients. Mean caliber of the portal vein significantly decreased after the operation: preoperative = 1.52 +/- 0.32; after 7 to 30 days = 1.32 +/- 0.16 (p less than 0.001), and after 4 to 12 months = 0.99 +/- 0.19 (p less than 0.001). The overall postoperative incidence of portal thrombosis was 22.2%. Thirteen of these patients also underwent a postoperative (4 to 36 months) pulsed Doppler investigation. Flow towards anastomosis was demonstrated in the splenic vein in 11 patients, and in 7 cases, typical caval pulsatility was observed. Decreased hepatopetal flow in the portal vein was found in 10 of 13 patients. In two patients, no flow was detectable and in the other the flow was hepatofugal. On the basis of our data, we can affirm that pulsed Doppler investigation may provide useful data for the evaluation of shunt patency and preservation of a decreased portal hepatic perfusion in the majority of patients.\r"

The direction and velocity of the variceal flow during inhalation and exhalation could be inferred from the color, its brightness or the Doppler time-velocity spectrum. The mean intravariceal flow velocity was significantly higher during inhalation (20.6 cm per sec) than in exhalation (11.5 cm per sec; p less than 0.01). The direction of intravariceal flow at any given point did not change throughout the respiratory cycle. However, a combination of real-time color flow imaging and the doppler time-velocity spectrum revealed that, when the sampling point was near the peak of the curve of the varix, the spectrum falsely indicated reversal of direction between inhalation and exhalation. This semiinvasive method, which yields anatomical and physiological information simultaneously, appears to be very useful for the study of variceal flow.\r"

The disease is associated with granulomatous bile duct destruction, cholestasis, hepatic copper overloading and the development of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis or both. There have been numerous therapeutic trials evaluating immunosuppressive, antifibrotic and cupruretic agents. Prednisolone, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, colchicine and chlorambucil have been evaluated in controlled clinical trials, and biochemical improvement of liver function has been noted with all of the agents, except D-penicillamine. Improved survival has also been reported in patients treated long-term with azathioprine and colchicine. However, none of the therapeutic agents has been demonstrated to halt histologic progression of the disease or to induce a complete clinical, biochemical and histologic remission as has been reported in patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis treated with corticosteroids. Many of the trials did not use a double-blind design, failed to use the \"intent to treat\" rule or failed to define an objective time to analyze results. Many of the studies involved small numbers of patients with short-term follow-up and thus potentially were inadequate to appreciate drug effects that might be of clinical benefit. Currently, there is no totally effective therapy for primary biliary cirrhosis. We believe that well-designed clinical trials can provide important information to better understand this disease until a totally effective therapy is available. New clinical trials should use well-established methodologic guidelines in study design and well-accepted statistical standards in the analysis and interpretation of results.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that cytotoxic T cells are involved in the recognition and lysis of the infected hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and that the target antigen is probably HBcAg which is displayed on the hepatocyte membrane during active viral replication. However, studies in other viral infection have demonstrated that cytotoxic T cells recognize viral antigen on the infected cells only in the context of HLA class I antigens. To test whether this mechanism is also operative in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, we studied the expression of HLA class I antigens in livers from 35 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody against HLA class I antigens. The blocking effect of monoclonal antibody against HLA class I antigens on the in vitro T cell cytotoxicity to autologous hepatocytes was also studied. The results revealed that HLA class I antigen was undetectable on the hepatocyte membrane in all of 10 HBeAg-positive carriers with minor hepatitic activity, whereas it was demonstrated in 15 (88%) of the 17 HbeAg-positive patients with chronic active liver disease and in 7 (87%) of the 8 anti-HBe-positive \"normal\" carriers. The in vitro T cell cytotoxicity to autologous hepatocytes in six HBeAg-positive patients with chronic active liver disease was significantly inhibited by preincubation of hepatocytes with monoclonal antibody (10 to 40 micrograms per ml) against HLA class I antigen, but not by monoclonal antibody against HLA class II antigens and non-HLA-associated surface molecules (Leu 11).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Research in pulmonary microvascular permeability has been a hot bed of activity for the last 20 years, primarily because increases in permeability contribute to the development of some forms of pulmonary edema in humans. New techniques and animal preparations have lead to significant advances, and most of these advances have been well described in several recent reviews. Unfortunately, there is still confusion over what the techniques measure and when they can be used to make reliable permeability estimates. Furthermore, we have a different point of view than previous authors. For instance: 1) we question the assumption that lymph flow rate is proportional to filtration rate, whereas other authors have implicitly assumed this relationship to be true; 2) we believe that the wide range of filtration coefficients measured with various techniques may be narrowed by consideration of the types of errors likely to result with each technique; 3) we place more emphasis than previous authors on the potential problems caused by the collection of impure lung lymph and the possibility that lymph composition may be altered within lymph nodes. For these reasons we believe that readers may benefit from a review of the techniques used in pulmonary permeability studies written from our perspective.\r"

A submicronic aerosol of 99mTc-DTPA was insufflated into the lungs of anesthetized, tracheotomized rabbits before and 1 h after the administration of the aerosolized detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (OT). Rabbits were ventilated by one of four methods: 1) spontaneous breathing; 2) CMV at 12 cmH2O mean airway pressure (MAP); 3) HFO at 12 cmH2O MAP; 4) HFO at 16 cmH2O MAP. Administration of OT resulted in decreased arterial PO2 (PaO2), increased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios, and abnormal lung pressure-volume relationships, compatible with increased surface tension. 99mTc-DTPA clearance was accelerated after OT in all groups. The post-OT rate of clearance (k) was significantly faster (P less than 0.05) in the CMV at 12 cmH2O MAP [k = 7.57 +/- 0.71%/min (SE)] and HFO at 16 cmH2O MAP (k = 6.92 +/- 0.61%/min) groups than in the spontaneously breathing (k = 4.32 +/- 0.55%/min) and HFO at 12 cmH2O MAP (4.68 +/- 0.63%/min) groups. The clearance curves were biexponential in the former two groups. We conclude that pulmonary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA is accelerated in high surface tension pulmonary edema, and this effect is enhanced by both conventional ventilation and HFO at high mean airway pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Our purpose was to determine the effect of an endotoxin-induced lung injury on circulating lipid peroxides. We measured both malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (as optical density at 233 nm) in aortic and venous plasma and lung lymph in 10 unanesthetized sheep given 1 microgram/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin. Total lipids and prostanoids 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were also measured. Six control sheep were also studied. Animals were monitored for a 12-h period and then killed, and lung tissue MDA was determined. A two-phase endotoxin response was noted with an initial pulmonary hypertension followed by a steady-state increase in protein-rich lung lymph flow (QL) between a 3- and 6-h period. Aortic plasma MDA was significantly increased from a base line of 4.8 +/- 1.4 to 8.9 +/- 1.6 and 7.5 +/- 1.3 nmol/ml at 1 and 4 h post-endotoxin. Aortic plasma conjugated dienes increased in all 10 sheep post-endotoxin. Venous levels of both MDA and conjugated dienes were not significantly increased. Lung QL increased two- to three-fold. Lung lymph MDA increased significantly at 1 h post-endotoxin. Lymph conjugated dienes decreased. Plasma and lymph lipid peroxide levels returned to base line by 12 h in most animals. However, tissue MDA remained significantly increased in all sheep from base line of 45 +/- 9 to 85 +/- 14 nmol/g tissue. We conclude that both MDA and conjugated dienes are transiently released into aortic plasma during endotoxin-induced oxidant lung injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury associated with clinical and experimental sepsis. Data from in vitro systems and experimental animals have suggested that neutrophil-derived oxidants, particularly H2O2, may be primarily responsible for endothelial damage, vasoconstriction, and lung edema. With the use of endotoxin infusion as an in vivo model of sepsis we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with catalase, a peroxide scavenger, would ameliorate the resultant changes in pulmonary vasoconstriction and lung fluid balance. Paired experiments were performed in 16 goats with chronic lung lymph fistulas. One group of animals (n = 7) received endotoxin first alone and then again, several days later, after pretreatment with Ficoll-linked catalase. As a control, identical experiments were performed in a separate group (n = 6) with Ficoll-linked albumin substituted for Ficoll-catalase. A third group (n = 3) was given endotoxin alone and then again during a continuous infusion of catalase. Plasma and lymph levels of catalase were comparable to or exceeded those previously shown to be completely protective in isolated perfused lung preparations and in vitro systems. Endotoxin caused neutropenia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, decreased cardiac output, and increases in lymph flow to approximately three times base line, with a return of all variables toward control values by 6 h. Catalase pretreatment produced no significant differences in any of these variables. These experiments do not support a role for H2O2 as a mediator of acute lung injury due to endotoxemia.\r"

Bronchodilator therapy was withheld the day before and throughout each study day. There were no significant differences in base-line lung function before exercise or any of the three methacholine bronchoprovocations. Exercise produced a 25 +/- 3% maximal fall in 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) within 15 min. This attack was not associated with either an immediate or a delayed increase in methacholine sensitivity. The provocation concentration of methacholine required to reduce the FEV1 20% from saline control at base line and 4 and 24 h after exercise were 0.8 +/- 0.5, 0.9 +/- 0.5, and 1.1 +/- 0.8 mg/ml, respectively. This was not significant by a one-way analysis of variance (F = 0.078, P = NS). These data demonstrate that exercise-induced asthma does not produce an increase in nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Hence, if mediators are elaborated with exercise as has been suggested, they appear to function differently than when released by antigen.\r"

Both groups had otherwise identical posterior fusions and Harrington instrumentation. There was no difference between the two groups in a blind, radiographic assessment of bone graft mass at six months, nor in maintenance of the curve correction over the same period. No major operative complications nor failures of instrumentation were encountered. There was, however, a marked reduction in operative time and blood loss in the patients receiving donor bone and also a much lower incidence of late symptoms relating to the operative sites. We conclude that, even in the presence of adequate iliac crest, the use of bank bone is superior for grafting in idiopathic scoliosis surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA) was used to study hormone release from cultured normal and neoplastic human pituitary cells. The RHPA revealed a lower percentage of GH- and PRL-producing cells in normal and neoplastic pituitaries compared to the percentage of these cells revealed by immunocytochemical (ICC) staining for GH and PRL. Normal pituitary tissues as well as some PRL- or GH-producing adenomas contained large numbers of mammosomatotropic (MS) cells when analyzed by RHPA, combined RHPA-ICC, and ultrastructural immunohistochemistry with immunogold labeling. The percentage of GH and PRL cells in normal pituitaries ranged from 37-51% and 30-60%, respectively, by RHPA, while the percentage of MS cells ranged from 29-49%. The percentage of GH and PRL cells in normal pituitaries estimated by ICC ranged from 53-65% and 32-55%, respectively, while the percentage of MS cells estimated with this technique ranged from 26-50%. Double labeling with the immunogold technique detected GH and PRL in the same cells and within the same granules in both normal and neoplastic pituitary cells. These results indicate that MS cells are present in normal human pituitaries as well as in some pituitary adenomas, and in some pituitaries these two hormones are stored within the same secretory granules.\r"

The mean urinary GH values in the normal adults, patients with acromegaly, and patients with hypopituitarism were 13.8 +/- 4.0 (+/- SE) and 431.1 +/- 149.1 ng/g creatinine (Cr) (1.56 +/- 0.45 and 48.77 +/- 16.87 ng/mmol Cr) and undetectable, respectively; these mean values were significantly different from each other. In the normal but short children the urinary values ranged from undetectable to 55.8 ng/g Cr (6.31 ng/mmol Cr). All of the normal but short children and 4 patients with hypopituitarism participated in a 24-h endogenous GH secretion study. The urinary GH values correlated significantly with the mean 24-h plasma GH concentrations as an index of endogenous GH secretion (r = 0.81; P less than 0.001) and plasma somatomedin-C levels (r = 0.67; P less than 0.001), respectively. In 6 patients with acromegaly whose plasma GH levels were constant throughout a 4-h period, the urinary GH values also significantly correlated with the mean plasma GH levels (r = 0.95; P less than 0.01). These data indicate that urinary GH measurements reflect endogenous GH secretion and that measurement of urinary GH excretion is a useful, simple, and practical method for evaluating endogenous GH secretion.\r"

  ".U": "88228391\r", 
  ".W": "Secretin is a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and enhances the insulin response to glucose. The mechanism by which secretin acts on the beta-cell has not been extensively studied. The plasma insulin responses to secretin (2 U/kg), expressed as the percent increase relative to basal plasma insulin concentrations, were similar in normal (n = 23) and obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (n = 12), but were decreased in obese subjects with abnormal glucose tolerance (n = 11). The insulin response to secretin was directly proportional to the basal insulin concentration in these three groups. The effects of secretin on beta-cell function was not altered by propranolol (n = 6), atropine (n = 8), or surgical vagotomy (n = 10). Patients with single islet cell tumors secreting insulin (n = 18) had no plasma insulin response to secretin, whereas patients with noninsulin-secreting pancreatic tumors (gastrinomas; n = 6) and patients in whom single insulinomas had been removed (n = 7) responded normally. Two adult patients with multiple B-cell adenomas and hyperplasia (not associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) hyperresponded to secretin, whereas patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I, without hyperinsulinism responded normally. One patient with nesidioblastosis had no response to secretin, indicating that the pathophysiology of this entity is distinct from that of other forms of islet hyperplasia. These data suggest that secretin stimulates beta-cells directly rather than through cholinergic, adrenergic, or vagal peptidergic neural mechanisms. In addition, the ability to respond to secretin appears to be lost in patients with single insulinomas and nesidioblastosis, but not in those with multiple B-cell adenomas and hyperplasia. The lack of a plasma insulin response in patients with single insulinomas and the high normal or exaggerated response in patients with multiple B-cell adenomas and hyperplasia may prove useful in differentiating these entities.\r"

  ".U": "88228404\r", 
  ".W": "The respective modulating effects of continuous and intermittent insulin delivery on pancreatic islet cell function were studied in seven normal men and nine insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetic patients. In the normal men, saline or continuous (0.8 mU kg-1 min-1) or pulsatile (5.2 mU kg-1 min-1, with a switching on/off length of 2/11 min) human insulin were delivered on different days and in random order. Despite hyperinsulinemia, blood glucose was kept close to its basal value by the glucose clamp technique. The diabetic patients also were infused in random order and on different days with either saline or a smaller amount of insulin delivered continuously (0.15 mU kg-1 min-1) or in a pulsatile manner (0.97 mU kg-1 min-1 for 2 min, followed by 11 min during which no insulin was infused). In all experiments, 5 g arginine were given iv as a bolus dose 30 min before the end of the study, and plasma C-peptide and glucagon levels were determined to assess islet cell function. In the normal men, insulin administration resulted in a significant decline of basal plasma glucagon and C-peptide levels and in a clear-cut decrease in the arginine-induced glucagon response. These effects of insulin were significantly more marked when insulin was delivered in a pulsatile rather than a continuous manner. In the insulin-dependent diabetic patients, the lower dose of insulin infused continuously did not alter the basal or arginine-stimulated glucagon response. In contrast, when the same amount of insulin was delivered intermittently, arginine-induced glucagon release was greatly reduced. Thus, these data support the concept that insulin per se is a potent physiological modulator of islet A- and B-cell function. Furthermore, they suggest that these effects of insulin are reinforced when the hormone is administered in an intermittent manner in an attempt to reproduce the pulsatile physiological release of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypoglycemia per se on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) were studied in eight normal young adults. The EEG and VEPs were recorded before and during hypoglycemic clamp studies, carried out at plasma insulin and glucose concentrations of about 287 pmol/L and 2.38 mmol/L, respectively. From the mean power EEG spectra obtained during each testing condition, several parameters in each frequency band considered were compared statistically. During the eyes closed recording, the mean frequency of the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) decreased from 10.1 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) Hz in both the right and left frontal leads during euglycemia to 8.8 +/- 0.2 and 8.8 +/- 0.1 Hz (left and right frontal leads, respectively; P less than 0.05) during hypoglycemia. In the same leads, the peak frequency decreased from 10.6 +/- 0.4 and 10.3 +/- 0.4 Hz to 9.6 +/- 0.4 and 9.5 +/- 0.3 Hz, respectively (P less than 0.05). A similar pattern of variation was found during the eyes open recording. In contrast, mean VEP latencies did not vary significantly; they were 118 +/- 3 ms (smallest image size; square wave signals subtending 30 min of arc) and 116 +/- 3 ms (largest image size; square wave signals subtending 60 min of arc) during euglycemia to 121 +/- 3 and 119 +/- 3 ms, respectively, during hypoglycemia. This study demonstrates that the earliest hypoglycemia-induced EEG alterations occur in the frontal regions and can be quantified in terms of decreased mean and peak frequencies of the alpha-band. VEP latency is less sensitive. If confirmed in diabetic patients, these data may provide a theoretical basis for developing a portable device to detect early hypoglycemia in those patients who lack warning symptoms.\r"

There was a significant linear correlation between the area under the insulin response curve (IRI-AUC) and serum testosterone (T) (r = 0.78, p = 0.0001). Using stepwise multiple linear regression, IRI-AUC was characterized as a function of both serum T and DHEAS; positively with T and negatively with DHEAS. In vitro (n = 17), there was a positive correlation between RBC-insulin binding and serum DHEAS (r = 0.54, p = 0.029) and a negative correlation between RBC-binding and T (r = -0.57, p = 0.017). We conclude that DHEAS may enhance insulin binding and action and that DHEAS and T have divergent functional relationships with IRI. DHEAS and T may therefore exert opposing effects on insulin secretion and action.\r"

During the first 8 weeks patients received either placebo, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg of acitretin daily in a double-blind manner. The dosages of 10 mg and 25 mg daily did not achieve any statistically significant improvement in psoriasis over placebo; however, both the 50 and 75 mg dosages were statistically significantly better than placebo. Side effects were primarily mucocutaneous and occurred in most patients receiving 25 mg or more of acitretin daily. After the double-blind period, patients continued treatment in an open fashion until they had received a total of 24 weeks of acitretin therapy. Most patients received 50 mg of acitretin daily, which adequately cleared their psoriasis. After approximately 3 months without acitretin, most patients required retreatment. Subsequent 24-week courses of therapy were generally effective and well tolerated. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevations of triglyceride, cholesterol, and liver transaminase levels. The efficacy and side effects of acitretin appear to be similar to those of etretinate; the principal advantage of acitretin is its shorter half-life. Although acitretin is a potent teratogen, its rapid elimination makes it a viable treatment for psoriasis among women of childbearing potential.\r"

In recent years dermatologists have broadened the indications for phenytoin use to include recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, linear scleroderma, and pachyonychia congenita. In spite of widespread use and popularity, it is interesting that the frequency of complications relating to drug therapy remains low, relatively speaking. Nevertheless, a broad spectrum of cutaneous and immunologic reactions to phenytoin have been reported. These range from tissue proliferative syndromes (side effects), drug hypersensitivity syndromes (allergic effects), and a possible linkage with lymphoma (idiosyncratic effects). Therapeutic and toxic reactions to this commonly prescribed drug are comprehensively reviewed, analyzed, and summarized in this monograph.\r"

After exposure of PTK2 cells to colchicine, the filaments collapsed into thick perinuclear coils, confirming the presence of intermediate filament reactivity.

  ".W": "Nasal lavage after antigenic and nonantigenic nasal stimulation has become an important tool for the study of inflammatory phenomena in the upper airway. Biochemical and cytologic information is relatively easily obtainable, and pharmacologic manipulations can be readily monitored. This article is of several studies aiming toward a more profound understanding of the mechanisms of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis by the use of laboratory-challenge procedures and nasal-lavage techniques. An early and a late reaction are detected clinically in the nose after antigen challenge of allergic individuals. In addition, the sensitivity to antigen significantly increases after the initial challenge, and this phenomenon is not obligatorily linked to the presence of a late-phase reaction (LPR). Inflammatory mediators, mostly mast cell- and/or basophil-derived, are detected in the nasal washes and correlate with the symptomatology in both the early and the late reactions. The allergen-induced LPR is marked by an early influx of eosinophils and, later, basophils and neutrophils. Elevation of major basic protein and histamine, but not prostaglandin D2, is detected during the LPR, giving evidence of active eosinophil and basophil participation. Systemic steroids can effectively suppress the clinical, biochemic, and cellular manifestations of antigen-induced LPR. Topical steroids have a similar effect but are also capable of suppressing the early reaction to antigen. A nonallergic form of rhinitis can be induced in the laboratory by nasal inhalation of dry air at freezing temperatures in individuals who report sensitivity to cold and windy environments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lawrence first reported that it was possible to transfer delayed-type hypersensitivity from sensitized donors to unsensitized recipients with lysates of blood leukocytes. During recent years, research from several laboratories has demonstrated that this effect is immunologically specific. Although the molecules that possess this activity have not been completely characterized, there is a significant body of evidence that they are small polypeptides and that they can interact with antigen molecules in an immunologically specific manner. Studies with immune responses that are under genetic control have demonstrated that the ability of an animal to produce transfer factor is genetically regulated but that transfer of delayed hypersensitivity with transfer factor is not genetically restricted. In fact, when mice of low-responder phenotypes are administered transfer factor from high-responder donors, they express delayed hypersensitivity responses that are comparable to the high responders. Clinical studies have demonstrated that transfer factor is an efficacious method for immunotherapy of certain viral and fungal infections.\r"

Here, the role of the eosinophil in chronic inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses was studied with tissue from patients who underwent surgery for chronic sinusitis. Paranasal tissue from patients with chronic asthma and/or allergic rhinitis was extensively infiltrated with eosinophils. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated a striking association between the presence of extracellular deposition of major basic protein and damage to sinus mucosa. The histopathology of paranasal respiratory epithelium appeared similar to that described in bronchial asthma. These findings suggest that the eosinophil acts as an effector cell in chronic inflammatory disease of paranasal respiratory epithelium. Thus, sinus disease in patients with asthma may be due to the same mechanisms that cause damage to bronchial epithelium.\r"

Methacholine challenges were completed by 11 subjects 2 hours before and 20 minutes after placebo, and 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg of inhaled gallopamil administered in a single-blind, randomized manner on different days. Gallopamil did not significantly alter FVC, FEV1, or forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC, but increased the dose of methacholine required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline (p less than 0.0001). The mean +/- SEM fold increase in the dose of methacholine required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline was 1.0 +/- 0.1 after placebo, 2.4 +/- 0.2 after 1 mg, 2.2 +/- 0.2 after 2 mg, 2.5 +/- 0.2 after 5 mg, 2.5 +/- 0.3 after 10 mg, and 2.3 +/- 0.2 after 20 mg. Thirty minutes before a standardized exercise challenge, 10 subjects inhaled 1 and 10 mg of gallopamil or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. The mean +/- SEM maximum decrease in FEV1 after exercise was 25.1 +/- 5% after 10 mg of gallopamil (p less than 0.01), 34.4 +/- 5% after 1 mg (p greater than 0.05), and 39.0 +/- 6% after placebo. We conclude that inhaled gallopamil only modestly alters airway reactivity to methacholine; increasing the dose greater than 1 mg did not provide greater benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The other third may have allergic rhinitis, and this allergic rhinitis could play a direct role in producing eustachian tube dysfunction in recurrent otitis media. However, viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may also induce IgE-mediated release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, and could cause otitis media on the basis of viral infection alone. Subtle immunologic deficiencies involving the IgG2 subclass and other immunoglobulin subclasses may also be lower in otitis-prone children, and this may be a genetically inherited disorder. Finally, the possibility of food allergy in otitis media must be considered, particularly in the young otitis-prone child with chronic recurrent otitis media.\r"

Headache and facial tenderness, frequently noted in adults with sinusitis, are not common. Much remains to be learned about diagnostic techniques and therapy of sinusitis. Nasal cytology can be valuable for discriminating between allergic and infectious disease, but lacks both sensitivity and specificity. Although there is a high correlation between radiographs showing significant sinus membrane thickening or clouding and recovery of bacteria from antral taps, it is possible to see positive films in asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, films may be unremarkable, although the history and physical examination yield convincingly positive evidence for sinus infection. The clinician must sometimes decide on therapy when the diagnosis is not definitive. Antimicrobial therapy for sinusitis should be given for 3 to 4 weeks in many cases. Amoxicillin remains a good choice for therapy, but antibiotics capable of clearing infections by beta lactamase-producing bacteria should be considered in refractory situations. The value of antihistamines, decongestants, nasal steroids, and cromolyn sodium are unstudied at this time. If several antibiotic courses fail to alleviate the signs and symptoms of sinusitis, surgery is indicated. Antral lavage and creation of nasoantral windows is the usual approach in children. Patients with sinusitis often have concurrent middle ear disease. Patients with current sinusitis have a higher incidence of immunoglobulin disorders than found in a normal pediatric sample. It appears that patients with sinusitis are more often allergic than would be expected from 2 typical population distribution. More evaluation is needed to clarify these associations.\r"

The superior placement of the maxillary ostia predisposes to maxillary sinusitis. A number of surgical procedures are available to treat chronic sinusitis that does not respond to appropriate medical therapy. The recently introduced technique of endoscopic surgery of the sinuses shows great promise. The association of sinusitis and bronchial asthma is well recognized, but causality is more difficult to prove. There is suggestive evidence in both children and adults that medical or surgical treatment of underlying sinusitis frequently improves the asthmatic state, but well-designed prospective studies are needed that control or measure relevant variables.\r"

This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways. Both of these examples suggest that inflammatory processes occurring totally or primarily in the upper airway may participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness and asthma.\r"

The health effects of outdoor air pollutants traditionally have been assessed through measurements of lower respiratory tract changes. However, it has been shown that one outdoor air pollutant, sulfur dioxide, decreases nasal mucus flow and increases nasal airway resistance. Along with cigarette smoke, indoor air pollutants such as formaldehyde, cadmium, and ammonium or sulfate ions have been shown to alter upper airway mucociliary function. Emissions from wood stoves are known to irritate the upper airways. Measurement of nasal airway resistance using posterior rhinomanometry allows quantification of nasal function. This technique recently has been used to demonstrate that adolescents with allergic asthma have increased work of breathing after inhalation of 0.5 ppm sulfur dioxide. Another study using posterior rhinomanometry showed that clerical workers had increased work of breathing after exposure to carbonless copy paper as compared with bond paper. This brief review of upper respiratory tract changes after pollutant exposure should serve as a reminder that a complete clinical history must include questions designed to ascertain the patient's exposure history to both outdoor and indoor air pollutants. These exposures can have a major impact on the health of the upper respiratory system.\r"

Asthma is one of the most common respiratory manifestations in children, and it is well known that many factors may provoke an attack. When considering the relationship between foods and asthma, we must keep in mind that food allergy may coexist with an inhalant allergy and that other nonallergens, such as pollutants, smoke, or additives, may modulate or modify bronchial reactivity and thus favor the food allergen action. In a study using clinical history, prick test, radioallergosorbent test, and double-blind food challenge, we demonstrated respiratory symptoms related to food allergy in 13 of 140 (9.2%) children with asthma. Asthma, in particular, was demonstrated in 8 of 140 (5.7%) patients. Food allergy respiratory symptoms are, in our experience, almost always associated with other clinical manifestations (e.g., cutaneous, gastrointestinal). The recognition of food-dependent IgE-mediated respiratory symptoms is essentially limited to those cases characterized by food allergy with asthmatic expression. It is possible, however, that in many cases foods may have a nonspecific role in the determination of asthma or in the preparation of bronchi for the possible consequent stimulus.\r"

In addition, quantitation of nasal secretions along with qualitative analysis of various components of nasal secretions has recently shed new light on the pathologic picture of nasal disease. Various means of measuring changes in nasal blood flow and nasal airflow have enjoyed increasing use in both investigative and clinical application.

Much of the controversy relates to the lack of sophistication in quantifying nasal versus oral respiration and the lack of longitudinal data. Nevertheless, a number of studies in laboratory animals, nonhuman primates, and humans have shown a relationship between nasal airway obstruction and aberrant facial growth. In monkeys, occlusion of the nares with silicon plugs triggered deviant muscle function and altered morphogenesis. In general, the nasally obstructed animals had longer faces and unusual dental malocclusions. In human studies allergic, mouth-breathing children have longer, narrower faces and retrognathic jaws, compared with control subjects. Medical intervention has not been shown to influence the pattern of facial growth in children with allergies. Surgical therapy to relieve nasal airway obstruction in children (whether adenoidectomy or turbinectomy) has not been shown to predictably affect ultimate facial form. Therefore, although an increasing body of literature demonstrates a relationship between nasal airway obstruction and facial growth, the clinician should be cautious in prescribing aggressive therapy or in promising dramatic results.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic rhinitis afflicts many American adults; the exact number is unknown because of the difficulty in establishing an exact diagnosis and because of the likely presence of overlap syndromes, including perennial allergic rhinitis, perennial nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia, and so-called vasomotor rhinitis. Nasal allergic reactions with release of pharmacologically active chemical mediators can participate in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinitis. In addition, reflex mechanisms probably play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of chronic nasal symptoms. Diagnosis is best achieved by a detailed history, with special attention to home, environmental, and occupation-related exposures and to selective epicutaneous skin tests and repeated smears of nasal secretions for detection of eosinophils. Therapy includes avoidance of all sorts of dust, fumes, sprays, and the like and appropriate attention to minimizing home environmental and occupational exposures. Pharmacotherapy is discussed elsewhere in this supplement.\r"

Comprehensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of new relatively nonsedating H1 receptor antagonists such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine are appearing. An understanding of the differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics among H1 receptor antagonists is required for optimal use of these drugs.\r"

The only active muscle that opens the eustachian tube is the tensor veli palatini, which promotes ventilation of the middle ear. The eustachian tube also functions to protect the middle ear from excessive sound pressure, and nasopharyngeal secretions. The eustachian tube helps drain the middle ear during opening and closing by pumping secretions from the middle ear; clearance of secretions also occurs. An understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the system can aid the clinician in understanding the role of eustachian tube dysfunction in the cause and pathogenesis of middle ear disease and the possible contribution of allergy to this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that there is an inverse relationship between cell activation and the expression of the Leu-8 Ag, a cell surface protein that distinguishes functionally distinct T cell populations. This was confirmed in vitro, because when resting PBL were activated with PHA there was a rapid decline in expression of the Leu-8 Ag on all lymphocyte subpopulations. A decline in Leu-8 reactivity occurred after stimulation of lymphocytes with PHA, anti-CD3 plus PMA and ionomycin plus PMA, and an intermediate decline in Leu-8 expression occurred after stimulation with Con A. However, there was little loss of expression of Leu-8 after stimulation of lymphocytes with PWM or allogeneic lymphocytes. The decline in Leu-8 expression on activated lymphocytes occurred earlier than the decline in expression of CD45R. After removal of the activation stimuli, peripheral blood T cells or Jurkat cells rapidly re-expressed Leu-8. Finally, when the expression of Leu-8 on peripheral blood CD4+, Leu-8+ T cells was reduced by prior activation with PHA, these cells continued to exhibit suppressor function for PWM-stimulated Ig synthesis. Thus, there is a rapid decline in expression of the Leu-8 Ag but no change in regulatory function of CD4+, Leu-8+ T cells during cell activation. These results suggest that the molecule recognized by anti-Leu-8 plays a role in lymphocyte activation but not directly in the effector function of CD4+, Leu8+ T cells.\r"

However, there has not previously been a murine model in which the effects of these mAb on the immune system could be studied in vivo. We have established such a model using the anti-murine-T3 mAb, 145-2C11. Administration of 145-2C11 led to rapid depletion of T cells from peripheral blood and suppression of skin graft rejection. However, depletion of T cells from spleen and lymph node was both delayed and incomplete. Full recovery of T cell number was dependent on the presence of a thymus, but treatment of thymectomized animals revealed that depletion was not the mechanism by which the mAb induced immunosuppression. Rather, alterations in TCR expression may play a more important role. TCR had modulated from T cells in spleen and lymph node early after treatment, and TCR expression remained subnormal for at least 51 days posttreatment. However, subnormal TCR expression alone could not fully explain the observed T cell dysfunction, inasmuch as a period of time existed after TCR re-expression during which T cells appeared to be anergic to CTL and MLR reactivity. These findings implicate T cell dysfunction as an important element in the induction of immunosuppression after anti-T3 administration.\r"

Using various approaches, we studied the avidity of these monoclonals in relation to their behavior in four anti-DNA assays. From the results obtained, we postulate that on the basis of anti-DNA avidity the anti-DNA ELISA, the polyethylene glycol assay, the indirect immunofluorescence test on Crithidia luciliae, and the Farr assay (in this order) detect a decreasing amount of anti-dsDNA, the Farr assay being strictly selective for high avidity anti-dsDNA. mAb selected by the anti-DNA ELISA generally were of a low avidity toward DNA. Using cardiolipin and dextran sulfate, a polyanion that bears a resemblance in charge to DNA, we studied the cross-reactivity of the monoclonals. A total of 6 of the 57 monoclonals were found to cross-react with cardiolipin, and 26 with dextran sulfate. We observed an inverse relationship between anti-DNA avidity and cross-reactivity: the lower the avidity of the antibody, the more cross-reactive it is. Based on these findings, we postulate that it is at least questionable whether low avidity, cross-reactive (monoclonal) anti-DNA is representative for the anti-DNA found in patients with SLE.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on the antigenic structure of the human CD45 glycoproteins using mAb have revealed the existence of four reactivity patterns defined specifically by distinct biochemical, cellular, and histochemical distributions. In addition to the two well characterized Ag specificities, CD45 and CD45R, present on the four glycoproteins (220, 205, 190, and 180 kDa) and on the 220-kDa member, respectively, we have identified two novel specificities. These have been defined by two different mAb, UCHL1 and PD7/26/16, that recognize an epitope exclusively expressed on the 180-kDa lowest molecular sized polypeptide and an epitope shared by the three higher molecular sized polypeptides (220, 205, 190 kDa) of the complex, respectively. It has been demonstrated that they are also part of the CD45 complex by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and binding assays with purified CD45 molecules. Comparative analysis by flow cytometry and immunoperoxidase techniques also showed a distinct pattern of cell distribution for each specificity. The 180-kDa specificity is present on a subset of T cells but absent on B lymphocytes, whereas the 220-kDa specificity is mainly expressed by B cells and a subpopulation of T lymphocytes. On the other hand, the cell distribution of the epitope common to the three higher members is slightly different to the conventional pan-leukocyte CD45 specificity. Thus, certain CD45+ cell types such as cutaneous Langerhans' cells, sinusoidal lymph node macrophages, and a small subset of T cells in both lymph node and tonsil did not express the 220/205/190-kDa specificity. These results further support that CD45 glycoproteins constitute a very heterogeneous molecular complex with epitopes that are selectively expressed by different cell types and by T cells at different stages of maturation.\r"

  ".U": "88229082\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work established that Candida albicans hyphae release several inhibitors of human neutrophil function. We now report that the crude hyphal inhibitory product (CHIP) inhibits superoxide anion (O2-) production stimulated by FMLP in a dose-related manner with an EC50 of approximately 2 micrograms/ml. CHIP also inhibited O2- production stimulated by A23187 and by opsonized zymosan, although this effect could be overcome by increasing the concentration of agonist. No inhibition of the PMA-stimulated burst was seen at any concentration of PMA tested, indicating that CHIP neither affected polymorphonuclear neutrophil viability nor quenched superoxide anion detection. A saturating dose of inhibitor had no effect on chemotaxis stimulated either by 0.1 to 100 nM FMLP or by zymosan-activated serum. Peak inositol trisphosphate levels stimulated by FMLP were not inhibited by a dose of CHIP producing maximum inhibition of FMLP-induced superoxide production. Peak changes in cytosolic free calcium levels (as measured by indo-1 fluorescence) stimulated by 50 nM or greater FMLP were unaffected by CHIP, although for subsaturating doses of FMLP a more rapid decline from peak calcium levels was seen in CHIP-exposed cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the common fungal pathogen C. albicans releases a substance that selectively impairs the neutrophil respiratory burst. It appears to do so without inhibiting the fully assembled NADPH oxidase and with minimal or no effect on events tightly coupled to FMLP-R/G protein activation, suggesting that these events may be uncoupled from activation of the burst. In addition, the absence of effect of CHIP on chemotaxis despite profound inhibition of the respiratory burst suggests these neutrophil functions may be mediated by divergent transduction pathways.\r"

In this paper we examined infected and noninfected uteroplacental tissues by immunocytochemistry to delineate the nature of the aberrant anti-listerial response. Overall the data support the hypothesis that local immunoregulation, which ordinarily prevents maternal anti-fetal, responses also prevents an effective anti-listerial response at the maternal-fetal interface. Different types of response were seen in different anatomic regions. Listeria first localized to the maternal decidua basalis, which contains a mixture of fetal class I MHC-bearing trophoblast and maternal cells. Here the listeria proliferated in an uncontrolled manner due to a striking inability of monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes to reach foci of infection. A second type of abnormal response was seen in the fetal chorioallantoic plate, a nontrophoblastic region of the placenta. Although macrophages were present, they were not appropriately activated as evidenced by a lack of Ia Ag and the presence of extracellular listeria colonies. Purely maternal tissues adjacent to the placenta had a normal anti-listerial response. During listeriosis, class I MHC expression was augmented throughout the placenta on cells normally bearing these Ag: trophoblast in the decidua basalis and both fetal and maternal stromal cells. Class II MHC Ag were induced on maternal and fetal endothelial cells but never appeared on trophoblast.\r"

By comparison, Mycobacterium bovis (strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as expected, stimulated macrophages to release a large amount of superoxide anion (O2-). M. lepraemurium did not interfere with the response to yeast when both microbes were added together to macrophages. The low release of O2- induced by M. lepraemurium was not due to failure of M. lepraemurium to activate or prime macrophages, because exposure of macrophages to M. lepraemurium caused the expected enhancement of O2- release when the macrophages were stimulated by PMA. Similarly, macrophages taken from mice infected with M. lepraemurium were activated, as indicated by high PMA-stimulated O2- release. Macrophages primed in vitro by exposure to Escherichia coli LPS for 24 h did show a moderate O2- response when stimulated by M. lepraemurium, but macrophages primed by exposure to IFN-gamma muramyl dipeptide, or M. lepraemurium showed a weak response when subsequently challenged with M. lepraemurium. The priming effect of M. lepraemurium or LPS decreased substantially after macrophages were cultured in fresh medium for 24 h. Heat killing or opsonization of M. lepraemurium caused the M. lepraemurium to stimulate a high amount of O2- release from LPS-primed macrophages, but heat killing or opsonization of M. lepraemurium had no effect on release of O2- from unprimed macrophages. The results suggest that M. lepraemurium is taken into macrophages by a mechanism that bypasses the FcR and other receptors that are capable of triggering the production of O2-.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were obtained from human ovarian tumors, expanded in the presence of IL-2 in culture and studied for cytotoxicity against fresh autologous and allogeneic ovarian carcinoma (CA) targets. TIL from ovarian tumors grew well in long term cultures, achieving from 8- to 682-fold expansion. TIL cultured with IL-2 were cytotoxic against both autologous and allogeneic fresh ovarian CA targets, and no specificity for autologous tumor could be demonstrated in any of the cultures. In all fresh TIL preparations, CD3+ lymphocytes were the major cell type and contained a high proportion (up to 51%) of activated (IL-2R+) cells as determined by two-color flow cytometry. Sorting of bulk TIL cultures followed by cytotoxicity assays identified the Leu-19+ cells, both CD3+ and CD3-, as effectors of cytotoxicity against autologous and allogeneic tumor cell targets. Cold target inhibition assays showed that allogeneic targets (both ovarian CA and a sarcoma) competed effectively with autologous ovarian CA targets for Leu-19+ effectors in TIL cultures. mAb to Leu-19 or Leu-2a did not block lysis of autologous targets by sorted effectors. OKT3 antibody augmented lysis of autologous targets by CD3+Leu-19- effectors only. These results show that non-MHC-restricted Leu-19+ effectors in cultures of TIL with 1000 U/ml of rIL-2 mediate lysis of autologous and allogeneic tumor cells. The CD3+Leu-19- cells, the main population in these cultures, do not mediate tumor lysis. To determine the phenotype of antitumor effectors in IL-2 cultures of TIL, cell sorting followed by functional assays are necessary.\r"

We have defined an abnormality within the CD4+ T cell compartment in young NZB and MRL-lpr/lpr mice by studying tolerance of spleen and B cells to the thymic independent Ag, fluorescein-Brucella abortus. Tolerization of spleen cells is defective in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, but not MRL-+/+ or C3H.lpr mice, suggesting that the defect requires both the autosomal MRL background and the lpr gene to be present. T enriched cells from NZB mice and from MRL-lpr/lpr mice (but not MRL-+/+ or C3H.lpr mice) reverse tolerance in spleen cells from [NZB X DBA/2]F1 and C3H/HeJ mice, respectively. This interference is removed by treatment with anti-CD4 antibody and C. Supernatants from cultured T cells of NZB and MRL-lpr/lpr mice also prevent tolerance in spleen cells of [NZB X DBA/2]F1 and MRL-+/+ mice, respectively, unless CD4+ cells are removed prior to T cell culture. Removal of T cells from NZB and MRL-lpr/lpr spleen cells allows normal tolerization of B cells, which is abrogated by the addition of syngeneic T cells or cultured T cell supernatants. This effect also depends on the presence of CD4+ T cells. These studies show that in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, through interaction of the lpr and MRL background genes in a T cell subset, and in NZB mice, CD4+ T cells interfere with B cell tolerance to a thymic-independent Ag.\r"

The diabetic animals had circulating islet cell surface antibodies (75%), and a monoclonal islet cell surface IgM antibody, K56aF3, generated from one of the diabetic BALB/c mice, mediated C-Dependent cytotoxicity against insulin-producing cells and inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release from isolated rat islets. Solid phase assay on thin layer chromatograms showed no binding of the K56aF3 antibody to glycolipids prepared from relevant cells. However, testing against a series of glycolipids of various non-pancreatic origins showed a preferential binding to a nine-sugar glycolipid isolated from human erythrocytes carrying an unusual blood group A determinant (type 3).

The zona pellucida also lacked these Ag, but granulosa cells expressed HLA class I Ag, beta 2-microglobulin, and HLA class II Ag.

Mice were irradiated (750 R) and injected twice daily with purified recombinant derived IL-1 beta (200 ng/injection). At various times after irradiation, the functional capacity of the hemopoietic and immune systems was determined. It was found that IL-1 therapy resulted in a significantly greater number of granulocyte-macrophage-CSF responsive colony-forming cells in the bone marrow of the irradiated mice on days 5 and 11 postirradiation but not at later times. In addition the radiation induced neutropenia recovered quicker in the IL-1-treated mice with significantly greater numbers of peripheral blood granulocytes being seen on days 15 and 20 after irradiation. The influence of IL-1 therapy on the recovery of the immune system was also assessed. Of note was the observation that mice receiving IL-1 therapy had chronically hypoplastic thymi. Although thymic cellularity increased with time after irradiation in the control mice, there was no such increase in the IL-1-treated mice. Similarly, the number of pre-B cells in the marrow of these mice was also diminished. Thus, in the IL-1-treated mice the regeneration of the peripheral immune function was retarded, characterized by a general lymphopenia and decreased splenic responses to mitogenic stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "CH12 tumor B cells specific for SRBC require SRBC as Ag and the lymphokine IL-5 (formerly known as BCGFII) for optimal proliferation and differentiation to Ig-secreting cells. Lysed SRBC and IL-5 purified to homogeneity synergize markedly, especially at low B cell densities. A sizable proportion of CH12 cells differentiate into Ig-secreting plaque-forming cells when low numbers of the B lymphoma cells (100 to 3000) are cultured with Ag and IL-5. IL-2 or IL-4 have no effects. Intact SRBC or lysed SRBC are equally effective as sources of Ag. Even in the presence of the mitogens LPS and dextran sulfate, there is a striking requirement for Ag for both proliferation and differentiation at low B cell density. Because of the low cell numbers used, the results strongly suggest that the effects of Ag and lymphokine are directly on the B cell. The cell surface phenotype of the CH12 lymphoma and the kinetics of their response suggest that CH12 B cells have the characteristics of activated B cells. Thus, it appears that Ag binding to surface Ig gives a direct signal to at least some B cells that is critical in the later phases of the B cell response after initial activation during which proliferation and differentiation to Ig secretion occur and that the lymphokine IL-5 costimulates with Ag to mediate this phase of the response.\r"

Aqueous extracts of stratum corneum samples from psoriatic lesions and from the heels of normal volunteers were ultrafiltered to yield 10- to 30-kDa fractions. The ultrafiltered psoriatic preparations consistently contained greater neutrophil chemokinetic activity than the normal heel preparations, but in contrast the latter contained markedly greater IL-1 activity than the former. Successive chromatographic purification of psoriatic lesional stratum corneum extracts showed that the neutrophil chemokinetic material previously reported to co-elute with IL-1 activity on reversed phase HPLC, but to be distinct from C5a des arg, could now be separated by anion exchange HPLC into at least four different chemokinetic compounds that were also resolved from the IL-1 activity. The reversed phase HPLC-purified chemokinetic material from psoriatic stratum corneum was also active in a neutrophil chemotaxis assay. These findings show that samples from psoriatic skin lesions contain a group of novel 10- to 30-kDa neutrophil chemoattractant compounds that are distinct from both C5a des arg and IL-1. The contrasting neutrophil chemokinetic and IL-1 activities in psoriatic lesional and normal heel stratum corneum preparations support the finding that the two activities are produced by different compounds. These neutrophil chemoattractant and IL-1-like compounds may be of pathogenic importance in inflammatory skin disease.\r"

However, both the previously studied Mov-3 and Mov-14 strains differ from the coisogenic C57BL/6 strain by different length segments of chromosome derived from the ICR strain in addition to the integrated M-MuLV genome. To conclusively demonstrate that an Ag encoded by M-MuLV is solely responsible for rejection of Mov skin grafts by coisogenic recipients, we have studied additional Mov strains that differ from coisogenic 129 or BALB/c backgrounds only by integration of an M-MuLV genome. A total of 129 strain recipients reject skin grafts from two viremic Mov strains, Mov-17 and Mov-18. A total of 129 strain hosts primed with either 1) multiple sets of Mov-17 and Mov-18 skin grafts or 2) single injections of Mov-17 and Mov-18 spleen cells produce M-MuLV-specific CTL that could be boosted in primary mixed lymphocyte culture. Generated CTL were reactive with Con A-stimulated lymphoblasts from all tested viremic Mov strains on the B6 and 129 backgrounds as well as B6 lymphomas. Further, we have observed that 129 strain mice reject Mov-9 skin grafts if these skin grafts are transplanted to virgin 129 recipients which have not received prior skin grafts from non-viremic Mov donors. In addition, skin grafts were transplanted from two viremic Mov strains, Mov-15 and Mov-16, to coisogenic BALB/c recipients; rejection of both sets of grafts was observed. However, BALB/c responders did not generate specific CTL after priming in vivo, with either multiple sets of allogeneic grafts or spleen cell injections, and boosting in vitro. These observations confirm the ability of integrated and expressed M-MuLV genomes to encode what is operationally defined as a non-H-2 histocompatibility Ag.\r"

  ".W": "To study the regulation of MHC class I gene expression during embryonic development, we have characterized a number of clonal cell lines derived from somite stage mouse embryos that were established with or without infection by several transforming retroviruses in combination with murine leukemia viruses. Unlike embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells that have been used as a model for early embryos, the cell lines derived from somite stage embryos are negative for stage specific embryonic Ag-1 and do not appear to differentiate after retinoic acid treatment. Morphology varies from clone to clone and is distinct from that of F9 and other EC cells. In agreement with previous findings in in vivo embryos, expression of surface MHC class I antigen in 57 new clones is either undetectable or low (with variability). All of the clones respond to the addition of interferons and express MHC class I antigens at high levels, but the kinetics of mRNA accumulation vary considerably. To examine the basis of the generally low or absent MHC class I gene expression in these cells, we tested promoter activity of a MHC class I gene by CAT assay after transient DNA transfection. Regardless of the basal levels of mRNA or surface Ag, CAT activity directed by various portions of the 5' flanking region of the MHC class I gene was uniformly low. The cells showed neither the negative nor the positive regulation of MHC class I genes that had been noted respectively for EC cells and for cells expressing the Ag constitutively. The pattern seen in the new cell lines suggests that there is an intermediate stage in the developmental regulation of MHC class I gene expression that may operate during the middle to late stage of fetal development.\r"

Spleen cells, left or right popliteal lymph node cells, and tumor-infiltrating cells were obtained from tumor-inoculated rats and were cultured for 24 h. Culture supernatants were obtained and assessed for lymphocyte migration factor (LMF) activity with the use of a modified Boyden chamber. We found that tumor-infiltrating cells derived from T-9-sensitized rats produced LMF. Two waves of LMF production were observed. The first wave of LMF production was detected between 6 and 12 h (LMF-a) and the second wave of LMF production was detected between 4 and 6 days (LMF-4d and -6d) after tumor inoculation. The tumor-infiltrating cells consisted of heterogenous cell populations. We found that only tumor-infiltrating neutrophils of T-9-sensitized rats produced LMF-a. Five peaks of LMF (A through E) were detected upon fractionation of LMF-a using Mono Q anion exchange column chromatography. Peak D exhibited the strongest activity. The action of peak D was chemotactic, but not chemokinetic. The m.w. of peak D was 33,000 and 70,000. Only W3/25 (+) (helper/inducer) T cells were found to be sensitive to peak D. The production of LMF-a by purified tumor-infiltrating neutrophils in vitro is in agreement with the histologic observation that the infiltration of neutrophils precedes the appearance of W3/25 (+) T cells in tumor tissues of T-9-sensitized rats. It is thus likely that peak D of LMF-a is responsible for the infiltration of T lymphocytes into tumor tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Rat mAb have been raised to mouse liver-derived large granular lymphocytes (LGL). One of these mAb (4D11) binds specifically to mouse LGL and appears to recognize a non-allelic determinant on NK-active cell populations. The Ag recognized by 4D11 is expressed on LGL of all mouse strains tested, including C57BL/6 (B6), BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, and SJL/J; thus, we have provisionally called this Ag LGL-1. Analysis of various lymphoid and hemopoietic tissues has indicated that only normal tissues known to contain NK activity have 4D11+ cells. With B6 and B6 congenic strains, a positive correlation exists between the number of LGL in a sample and the percentage of 4D11 immunofluorescence-positive cells detected by flow cytometric analysis. Dual color immunofluorescence analyses indicate that some LGL-1+ cells are also stained for Ly-1 and Thy-1. A very small subset exists that is weakly positive for CD3 and LGL-1. However, virtually no cells are seen which co-express LGL-1 and Ly-2. LU activity against YAC-1 targets was increased 7- to 700-fold in LGL-1+ spleen cells obtained by cell sorting from several different strains of mice (B6, BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, SJL/J, and athymic/nude). Sorted, LGL-1- spleen cells contained little or no NK activity. Cells positively selected for LGL-1 also contained between 50 and 60% LGL by morphology. By using facilitated in vitro antibody plus C' treatments, the majority of NK activity can be depleted from both B6 spleen and liver-derived leukocyte populations enriched for NK cells. mAb 4D11 was also shown to precipitate a protein of approximately 87 kDa from the surface of enriched murine NK cells. This mAb should prove valuable for understanding the role of NK cells in the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "This immunohistologic study was undertaken to compare epidermal differentiation in normal and psoriatic skin. Although basal cells retain a normal phenotype in this disease, suprabasal layers exhibit abnormal sets of differentiation markers. The 67-kD keratin and Bd5 antigen, which are found in normal epidermis immediately above the basal layer, appear several layers higher in involved psoriatic epidermis. On the contrary, KF2 antigen, which is found in the upper spinous layers of normal epidermis, appears more precociously in psoriatic epidermis. Paradoxically, in this disease characterized by the absence of a granular layer, some markers specific for this layer in normal skin, such as involucrin and transglutaminase, appear in lower skin cell layers, while other granular markers, such as filaggrin, are either absent or found in the parakeratotic scales. These results point out the existence in psoriasis of a suprabasal cell population characterized by a set of markers that are never coexpressed in normal epidermis. The existence of this abnormal population of cells can be explained as the result of the inversion of two steps in the differentiation program. Thus, instead of an inability to express a given differentiation marker, psoriasis seems to be characterized by an abnormal sequence of expression of these markers.\r"

Further proteolysis of Mr 56k protein to Mr 44k and a doublet of Mr 45k and 47k also was detected with cathepsin D at pH 3.5 and 7.5, respectively, while the serine proteinase degraded Mr 56k protein to a number of protein bands.

However, there was a characteristic parallelism between the expression of c-fos and c-myc in normal epidermis, while the parallelism was not always definite in skin tumors. The ratio of c-fos/c-myc transcripts in normal epidermis was constant compared with the expression of other genes examined. These data suggest that c-fos and c-myc are expressed in all normal skin tissues, and that maintenance of a constant ratio of c-fos/c-myc is closely related to ordered cell growth of the tissues.\r"

There was no difference observed between acid phosphatase and cathepsin D activities among the three tumors. Cathepsin B and PA activities were slightly elevated in SCC. Type I collagenase activity of SCC was 9-fold higher than that of SK (p less than 0.01), and type IV collagenase was 3-fold higher per tissue DNA (p less than 0.05). Type I and IV collagenase of BCE were elevated per tissue protein but not elevated per tissue DNA. Correlation was found between the level of cell differentiation in SCC and the activities of cathepsin B, PA, and type I collagenase. Poorly differentiated SCC exhibited a tendency to have higher proteinase activities. Proteinases that showed high activities in malignant tumor homogenate may be related to the degradation of the surrounding cell matrix in addition to intracellular metabolism. Type I and IV collagenase, in cooperation with cathepsin B and PA, might play a major role in invading the dermal stroma and basement membrane.\r"

Because of the frequency of P. carinii pneumonia and because it is readily treatable, prompt, accurate, and efficient diagnostic schemes are extremely important. The clinical presentation is generally characterized by fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath. Such symptoms in a patient from a recognized HIV transmission category should prompt a diagnostic evaluation to identify P. carinii or other opportunistic infections. A chest radiograph usually provides an objective indication of lung disease. Pulmonary function tests, particularly the DLCO and lung imaging using 67Ga-labeled citrate, are useful screening tests in patients with normal chest radiographs. Examination of sputum induced by inhalation of aerosolized hypertonic saline is a very useful means of identifying P. carinii. Bronchoalveolar lavage is nearly 100% sensitive to the presence of P. carinii and should be performed in patients who have a nondiagnostic sputum examination. Transbronchial biopsy increases the overall yield for diagnoses other than P. carinii and should be performed in patients in whom bronchoalveolar lavage does not provide a diagnosis. Because of the effectiveness of sputum examinations and bronchoscopic procedures, open lung biopsy is rarely necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic relatedness of 100 strains of Escherichia coli, isolated mostly from patients with hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome, was determined for chromosomal genotypes on the basis of allelic variation at 17 enzyme-encoding loci detected by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Fifteen of the 17 loci were polymorphic, with an average of 3.5 alleles per locus. Comparison of the observed combinations of alleles among strains revealed 25 distinct multilocus genotypes, which were used to define naturally occurring cell lineages or clones. Cluster analysis of the genotypic data revealed that isolates of serotype O157:H7 fall into a well-defined group of clonal genotypes that share alleles, on average, at 90% of their enzyme loci. The O157:H7 clonal group is only distantly related to other Verotoxin-producing strains belonging to other serotypes of E. coli. The results strongly support the hypothesis that isolates of E. coli O157:H7 obtained from geographically separate outbreaks and sporadic cases of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome belong to a pathogenic clone that occurs throughout North America.\r"

HAV VP1 coding sequences were fused in-frame to NH2-terminal Escherichia coli TrpE coding sequences under the control of the tryptophan promoter. In the absence of exogenous tryptophan, E. coli containing this recombinant plasmid produced high levels of an 88-kilodalton fusion protein that was recognized in immunoblots by antibodies to TrpE and HAV. The TrpE/HAV VP1 protein was gel-purified and used to immunize rabbits. The resulting antiserum reacted with denatured HAV VP1 in immunoblots but did not react with intact virus. However, subsequent inoculation of an immunized animal with a subimmunogenic dose of inactivated, whole HAV resulted in the rapid appearance of a stable, virus-neutralizing antibody response.\r"

Norfloxacin, a carboxyquinolone with a 90% minimum inhibitory concentration for S. typhi of less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/mL, is a promising alternative. Carriers of S. typhi were treated in a double-blind trial with either norfloxacin (400 mg) or matching placebo given every 12 h for 28 d. Twelve assessable individuals were treated in each group. After therapy, 11 of 12 individuals treated with norfloxacin had negative stool and bile cultures for S. typhi. All placebo-treated carriers still had positive cultures immediately after therapy. Subsequently, 11 individuals were treated openly with norfloxacin. S. typhi was eradicated in seven of 11. Overall, the eradication rate for 23 individuals treated with norfloxacin was 78%. Eighteen individuals were followed up for one year, and their stool and/or bile cultures remained negative. From our results, norfloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for eradicating the chronic typhoid carrier state.\r"

  ".W": "Because nonsmoking underground bituminous coal miners often have symptoms of chronic bronchitis and because a high proportion of patients with chronic bronchitis have nonspecific airway hyperreactivity, we hypothesized that coal miners would have a higher prevalence of nonspecific airway hyperreactivity than nonminer nonsmoking control subjects. By use of a quantitative methacholine provocative inhalation challenge test, we evaluated 22 underground bituminous coal miners and 41 nonminer age- and sex-matched control subjects from the same community. We found that a significantly higher proportion of miners had reactivity to inhalation of 100 mg/ml or less of methacholine, X2 = 6.19, p less than 0.02. The slope of phase III of the single-breath nitrogen washout test was higher in the reactive miners than in the nonreactive miners and reactive control subjects, even though the reactive miners had only been working underground 8 +/- 3 (SEM) years. Within the reactive miner subgroup, the higher the reactivity to methacholine, the more abnormal the slope of phase III of the single-breath nitrogen test, r = 0.79. Miners had more symptoms than controls; the presence of methacholine reactivity was not associated with increased symptoms. We conclude that the bituminous coal miners in our study had an increased prevalence of nonspecific airway hyperreactivity and that within the reactive miner subgroup there was evidence of early airways disease. We speculate that the nonspecific airway hyperreactivity may be related to, and also be an indicator of, lung injury in coal miners.\r"

  ".W": "Historically, drugs of abuse have come from two sources: plant products and diverted pharmaceuticals. Today, new, totally synthetic drugs produced by clandestine laboratories have become an increasingly important source of abused substances. Of particular concern are the fentanyls, a family of very potent narcotic analgesics, which first appeared on the streets in California in 1979 under the name \"China White\". At least 10 different analogs have been identified to date and are thought to be responsible for over 100 overdose deaths. The fentanyls are not used by any particular ethic or age group, but rather by the general heroin using population. Their use, however, does seem to be restricted to suburban, rather than urban areas, and almost exclusively to the state of California. The most potent analogs, the 3-methyl- and beta-hydroxy-fentanyls, may be up to 1000 times as potent as heroin, but are not chemically related to the opiates and therefore not detected by conventional narcotic screening tests. However, using a sensitive radioimmunoassay highly specific for the fentanyls they can be measured at the very low concentrations observed in body fluids, generally less than 10 ng/mL. It is likely that, as efforts to restrict the importation of natural products and prevent diversion of pharmaceuticals become more effective, the fentanyls and other synthetics will become increasingly important drugs of abuse.\r"

This paper reviews empirical studies that have addressed the issue of whether there is an increased activation or efficiency of right hemispheric processes during imagery, hypnosis, rapid eye movement sleep, and dreaming. Overall, there is considerable evidence supporting the notion of increased right hemispheric activation in imagery. There is also some evidence supporting this view for rapid eye movement sleep, dreaming, and hypnotic phenomena. For the most part, however, the lack of adequate studies, contradictory or negative findings, and moderating variables make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions at this time.\r"
