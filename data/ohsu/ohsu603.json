  ".W": "In order to elucidate a participation of the mesangiolysis in the formation of diabetic nodular lesions, 355 kidney specimens obtained from 327 patients with primary diabetes mellitus were studied. Mesangiolyses begun by focal and segmental disintegration of the pivotal structure of the mesangium (\"torn off phase\"), resulting in cystic or aneurysmal dilatation of the involved tuft, were found in 56 specimens (16%). The dilated tufts were filled with lysed mesangial matrix, which showed a reticular or fibrillar arrangement (\"structureless phase\"), being followed by a concentrical re-arrangement (\"reconstructive phase\") and by the ultimate formation of diabetic nodules. The mesangiolysis of various phases was frequently found concomitant with severe diabetic arteriolosclerosis and, in the reconstructive phase, the lysed mesangial matrix near the recanalized capillary along the inner aspect of glomerular basement membrane was observed to be rearranged in a layered structure. These results suggest the hypothesis that: 1) the mesangiolysis is the initial lesion occurring in glomeruli in the process of diabetic nodule formation, and disturbed blood flow into glomeruli, caused by diabetic arteriolosclerosis, may be implicated in the development of the mesangiolysis; and 2) concentric compression of the lysed mesangial matrix by recanalized capillaries forms layered structures and ultimate completed diabetic nodules.\r"

  ".W": "Since the role of aldosterone in mediating extrarenal potassium transport remains uncertain, the effect of mineralocorticoid on potassium metabolism was assessed in anephric patients. Seven anephric patients underwent three identical 72-hour periods between hemodialyses during which treatment with either 10 mg/day deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) intramuscularly or 300 mg/day spironolactone orally was compared to a baseline control period. The serum potassium rise, plasma aldosterone, salivary and stool electrolytes were measured in response to potassium loading over 48 hours with a metabolic diet containing 38 mEq/day followed by an \"acute\" oral potassium load of 0.5 mEq/kg. Acute potassium loading with DOCA resulted in a lower increment in serum potassium than with spironolactone (P less than 0.01). The volume of distribution of the acute potassium load at three hours was 55% of body weight with DOCA, which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than with either spironolactone (35%) or control (34%). However, with the dietary load of potassium, the increments in serum potassium measured at 24 and 48 hours (13 hours post-prandial) were similar in all three periods. The volume of distribution of the dietary potassium was not altered by DOCA or spironolactone but had risen to an average of 172% at 24 hours and 243% at 48 hours in the three periods. Plasma aldosterone levels were low, positively correlated to the serum potassium and similar in all three periods without evidence of feedback inhibition by DOCA or stimulated by spironolactone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory and oxidative responses of human peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and peritoneal macrophages (PM phi) following exposure to unused continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis fluid (CAPD) and early dwell effluent were studied using an open oxygen (O2) electrode system and by measurement of oxygen radical-derived luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. Both cell types responded to stimulation by increasing O2 consumption and by generating chemiluminescence even at external O2 concentrations below 50 microM O2. Oxygen concentrations in the dialysate, as measured by blood gas analysis, were never lower than 118 +/- 8.3 microM O2 even during active peritonitis. Thus oxygen availability does not appear to be rate limiting for phagocyte oxidative metabolism in the peritoneal cavity. Preexposure of both inflammatory cell types to unused fluid or early dwell CAPD effluent significantly reduced both stimulated oxygen uptake and the subsequent ability of these cells to generate chemiluminescence without significantly affecting their viability. Further investigation of this down regulatory phenomenon using unused fluid and laboratory prepared dialysis fluid revealed that low pH (5.3) and high sodium lactate concentration in combination are directly responsible for the suppressive effect of unused fluid and early dwell effluent on cell function. These observations demonstrate that cellular host defense may be impaired early in the dialysis cycle as a result of lactate mediated \"stunning\" of resident phagocytes. The precise nature of the molecular species responsible for this suppressive effect remains to be identified.\r"

Survey responses indicate that the Navajo surveyed are quite knowledgeable about the various adverse consequences of alcohol abuse. The survey found that 52% of these Navajo adults currently drink at all, and the opinion responses generally characterize alcohol consumption, even in small amounts, as a negative behavior. Sixty-three percent of all Navajos agreed with the popular, but scientifically unsubstantiated, belief that Indians have a physical weakness to alcohol that non-Indians do not have. Alcohol legalization on the reservation is opposed by 81% of the Navajos surveyed. Opinions about alcohol use and policy do not vary greatly even when knowledge of alcohol consequences and current drinking status is considered. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of positive, solution-oriented public education and debate for entertaining new ideas about alcohol policy and for reducing the sequelae of alcohol abuse among the Navajo.\r"

Patients of Puerto Rican extraction (Hispanics) were found to be more often afflicted than Whites and Blacks by cognitive impairment, daily drinking, heaviest average amount drunk, unemployment and lack of residence. Whites were less affected by these variables than the other two ethnic groups. Amount and frequency of drinking predicted the occurrence of cognitive impairment to a degree that approached significance. Cognitive impairment was defined as inability to score less than 5 points in the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test. In a follow-up study, nearly all CT scans obtained on a similar group of 20 detoxifying alcoholics (mean age 40), who had cognitive impairment as defined in the first study, were found to demonstrate brain atrophy. Contrasting drinking practices rather than ethnicity may have accounted for the different rates of cognitive impairment observed among the three ethnic groups.\r"

Male subjects (N = 24) classified with respect to previous drinking experience were used in the experiment. Each subject was tested on a speed estimation task at blood alcohol levels (BALs) of 0 and 100 mg/dl. Subjects were required to decelerate from a constant speed of 30 mph to a target speed of 20 mph under two conditions: using their speedometer and being deprived of its use. Of interest were the subjective judgments made under the latter conditions. Results show that there was no significant effect of alcohol on the perception of speed. The expected interaction between previous drinking experience and alcohol dose was found to be nonsignificant. Overall, a significant difference in performance between the two speedometer conditions indicated that subjects overestimated the target speed when they were not given access to their speedometer. Possible explanations and implications of these findings are discussed and future directions for research are suggested.\r"

We report pilot data from a study designed to expand these observations by measuring blood alcohol levels (BALs), subjective intoxication effects, body sway and cognitive-motor task performance in women. Six young women with (FHP) and six without (FHN) alcoholic first degree relatives provided informed consent and were given 0.56 g/kg ethanol under double-blind conditions. Groups were matched for age, drinking history and height-weight ratio. Subjects performed tasks in random order at 90, 60 and 30 min before drinking alcohol, and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after drinking alcohol. BALs peaked at 80 mg/dl 30 to 60 min after drinking alcohol. BALs were comparable and disappearance rates were similar for both groups. BALs and intoxication ratings for both FHP and FHN women had highly significant correlations. Alcohol decreased accuracy on an automated version of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) for both groups, but FHN women made significantly more errors 30 min after alcohol. Significantly greater alcohol effects on body sway were apparent in FHN women 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after alcohol. Compared with previous findings for men, both FHP and FHN women reported less intoxication at similar BALs, but body sway in FHN women was more affected by alcohol. Small sample size limits generalization of these findings but suggests that some effects of familial alcoholism in women are similar to those observed in men.\r"

The analyses suggested that different paradigms describe the pathways to alcoholism for those whose fathers were and those whose fathers were not alcoholics. A mother's high esteem for her alcoholic husband increased risk for alcoholism of the son; among sons whose fathers were not alcoholic, increased risk for alcoholism of the son seemed to be a function of little control during early adolescence.\r"

Data were from 1,517 community-dwelling men who in 1973 (Time 1) and 1982 (Time 2) completed mailed questionnaires about their drinking behaviors. Time 2 quitters (n = 62) had consumed no alcohol for at least the 6 months before that survey; reducers (n = 255) had decreased their yearly alcohol consumption by at least one-half. Compared to 971 controls, quitters reported more drinking problems at Time 1; reducers reported higher consumption at Time 1, which was the only factor predictive of subsequent reduction (p less than .001). Regression analyses considering contextual-motivational factors for drinking showed that at Time 1 quitters were less likely than controls to have consumed alcohol during evenings out (p = .008), in family-home settings (p = .013), or for salutary reasons (p = .084); conversely, they were more likely to have consumed alcohol to reduce negative affect (p = .011). Reducers cited more social-situational reasons for curtailing drinking; quitters cited more personal reasons related to health and alcohol effects. These findings indicate that in a community sample of men, problematic drinking behaviors tend to predict subsequent abstention rather than reduced drinking.\r"

Male Wistar rats chronically consuming ethanol were fed isoenergetic diets containing 22% protein (controls) or 6% protein (protein-deprived) from 60 to 240 days of age. Protein malnutrition initiated at 60 days of age affected phosphatidylglycerol, sphingophospholipid, monosialoganglioside GM1 and cerebroside containing nervonic fatty acid by 240 days of age. Among the effects of ethanol was an increase of the relative proportion of lipid galactose in monogalactosyl glycolipids and of N-acetylneuraminic acid in the trisialoganglioside GT1b, while there was decrease of the lipid phosphorus in the investigated phospholipids and of the disialoganglioside GD1a. The low-protein diet generally interfered with ethanol effects except for monosialo GM3, GM2 and GM1 gangliosides. The present study was carried out to investigate whether the ethanol-induced effect on these brain lipids could be elevated when we switched these animals to diets with 21 or 34% protein during the following 90 days. It was found that increasing protein intake and cessation of drinking ethanol returned the investigated brain phospholipids, monogalactosyl glycolipids and gangliosides to control values.\r"

Absolute indications for operation initially on the aneurysm are the presence of symptoms or rupture. Absolute indications for operation initially on the malignancy are complications from the presence of the tumor such as hemorrhage, perforation, or obstruction. The type and stage of the cancer are major factors in determining operative treatment and priorities.\r"

Clinical features included chest wall mass (14), pain (11), bony involvement (6), fever (4), dyspnoea (4), weight loss (1), cough (1), and hemoptysis (1). Previously treated patients received different treatment protocols, which made evaluation difficult. Of our ten patients who have completed induction therapy, five received vincristine and cyclophosphamide, whereas the other five received more aggressive chemotherapy. Complete remission has been achieved in two and four of these patients, respectively. One patient in each group had recurrence of the disease, in both cases at the local site. Thus, from our preliminary data, we suggest that Askin Rosai tumor should be treated with complete surgical excision followed by an aggressive combination of chemotherapy and local radiotherapy.\r"

Of the 26 patients showing metastases on arteriogram, five revealed increased tumor vascularisation, five had normal vascularisation, and 16 showed decreased vascularisation of the metastases relative to liver. In liver perfusion scintigraphy, 15 of the 36 patients showed increased perfusion of the metastases, four had normal perfusion, and 17 had decreased tumor perfusion. The observed differences in survival in the different groups were not statistically significant: patients survived 15 months in the group with increased tumor vascularisation, 8 months for normal vascularisation, and 14 months for decreased tumor vascularisation; survival was 28 months for the group of increased, and 13 and 14 months for the normal and decreased tumor perfusion groups respectively. Also, response rates with 80%, 40%, and 75% responders in the group of increased, normal, and decreased tumor vascularisation, respectively, and 80%, 50%, and 59% responders in the group of increased, normal, and decreased perfusion, respectively, were not significantly different.

Tumor regression (CR + PR) was compared to thermal dose received, incorporating the premise that hyperthermia response is a function of time as well as temperature. A computer program was developed (after Sapareto and Dewey [2]) which stored minimum tumor temperatures recorded spatially and temporally during treatment and correlated response with T43 (equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C during the first treatment) and CT43 (cumulative T43, computed by multiplying T43 by the actual number of identical subsequent treatments received during the course of therapy). Those who responded--N = 46 (73%)--had significantly higher median thermal doses than those who did not respond. Comparison of T43 and CT43 thermal dose values between responders and nonresponders was significantly different at p values of 0.05 and 0.04, respectively. The data indicate that magnetic-induction hyperthermia and high-dose XRT was an effective treatment combination in advanced disease and that tumor response improved as thermal dose increased.\r"

The nude mouse is a suitable model for evaluation of the effects of this hormone on tumor xenografts in vivo, but little is known about long-term actions of secretin in this species. We investigated the impact of chronically administered synthetic porcine secretin in the nude mouse. Six groups of mice (eight animals each) received twice-daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or secretin at 0.5, 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 micrograms/kg for 14 days. Body weight and general health were unaffected by exogenous secretin, and no apparent behavioral effects were observed. Seven abdominal organs were examined at necropsy and all were histologically normal. The only organ that showed a weight change was the pancreas (13% decrease at the highest secretin dose). This was accompanied by decreases in DNA and RNA content, indicating pancreatic hypoplasia. Secretin administration caused changes in DNA and/or RNA content (but not protein content or weight) in liver, small bowel, cecum, and large bowel. No effect of secretin on stomach or kidney was observed. Our work demonstrates the safety of frequent injections of pharmacologic doses of secretin in this frail animal and suggests that the nude mouse is an appropriate model for the in vivo study of tumor growth regulation by secretin.\r"

Patients received Velban at a dose of 4 mg/week for 15 and 12 months postoperatively. Both patients remain disease free at 12 and 10 years, respectively.

The procedure uses cardiopulmonary bypass but necessitates dramatically longer bypass times than coronary artery bypass grafting or valve operations. We prospectively evaluated 22 patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy to determine the incidence of delirium and its relationship to certain preoperative and postoperative medical variables as well as to duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia, and circulatory arrest. Delirium occurred in 77% of patients with a peak incidence around 72 hours postoperatively. No preoperative or postoperative medical variable distinguished delirious from nondelirious patients. Total bypass time was not associated with delirium, but deep hypothermia time and total circulatory arrest time were both strongly associated. Overall prediction of delirium was 81% when total circulatory arrest time was considered. Further analysis suggested that a total circulatory arrest time greater than 55 minutes was both sensitive to (82%) and specific for (80%) delirium. Implications for the mechanism of postcardiotomy delirium and future research directions are discussed.\r"

Recovery of platelet count and function was compared in 27 patients who were randomized preoperatively to receive after cardiopulmonary bypass either 1 unit of fresh whole blood (15 patients) or 10 units of platelet concentrates (12 patients). Platelet count, bleeding time, platelet aggregation (adenosine diphosphate, collagen, epinephrine, and ristocetin) and platelet thromboxane formation were abnormal after cardiopulmonary bypass in all the patients. The increase of platelet count after 1 unit of fresh whole blood (from 115 +/- 32 X 10(9)/L to 148.5 +/- 36 X 10(9)/L) was similar to that achieved by 4 units of platelets (from 140 +/- 61 X 10(9)/L to 171 +/- 60 X 10(9)/L). The increase was doubled after 10 platelet units (from 140 +/- 61 X 10(9)/L to 209 +/- 55 X 10(9)/L). Bleeding time returned to normal values after fresh whole blood or after 8 platelet units. However, platelet thromboxane formation was higher after 1 unit of fresh whole blood than after 10 platelet units (95 +/- 25 versus 46 +/- 35 ng/ml, p less than 0.05), as was platelet aggregation response to collagen and epinephrine. The 24-hour blood loss was smaller in the fresh whole blood group (560 +/- 420 ml versus 770 +/- 360 ml), although the difference was not statistically significant. The results suggest that the hemostatic effect of 1 unit fresh whole blood after cardiopulmonary bypass is at least equal, if not superior, to the effect of 10 units of platelets.\r"

In the past 2 years 39 additional newborn infants have been treated with this modality, with an overall survival rate of 79% (31/39). This survival rate is much better than that obtained in 33 neonates who had been treated in the previous 5 years (54%; p less than 0.05). A new aspect of our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation program is the use of total apneic lung rest for persisting pulmonary interstitial emphysema during support with the oxygenator. Six neonates were treated with this technique because of worsening pulmonary interstitial emphysema during extracorporeal circulation. Five of them survived. Another indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in our pediatric population has been left ventricular or biventricular failure after cardiopulmonary bypass. Four of our seven patients treated for this indication are long-term survivors. At present, because of the impossibility of using other forms of left ventricular assist devices in the pediatric population, it seems that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is the most effective treatment for left ventricular failure after cardiopulmonary bypass. From our experience, even in the absence of long-term follow-up of patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, it appears that the benefits of this therapeutic modality far exceed the risks in the high-risk population for which it is being used.\r"

The children were grouped into four diagnostic categories: atrial septal defect or pulmonary valve stenosis (n = 8), ventricular septal defect (n = 36), complete transposition after Mustard's operation (n = 13), and tetralogy of Fallot (n = 13). Within 2 hours of bypass, both cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work index were adequate and increased appropriately with volume loading in all four diagnostic groups. The atrial septal defect group demonstrated a similar response to volume loading 4 and 24 hours after bypass. However, the other three diagnostic groups had a higher filling pressure, lower cardiac index and stroke work index, and a depressed response to increasing preload 4 hours postoperatively, which indicated a deterioration in cardiac performance. The deterioration was maximal between 4 and 12 hours after bypass, and performance tended to recover 24 hours postoperatively. The transposition group had a more profound depression in cardiac performance than the other two groups. Within the ventricular septal defect group, smaller children (body surface area less than 0.36 m2) had a more profound depression in performance than larger children. These results demonstrate a significant alteration in cardiac performance during the first 24 hours after repair of congenital cardiac defects in children. These changes should be considered when postoperative management is being planned.\r"

Extended end-to-end aortic arch anastomosis was used in an attempt to correct both the isthmic stenosis and the hypoplasia of the transverse arch. After complete excision of the coarctation tissue, a long incision was made in the inferior aspect of the aortic arch, which was then anastomosed to the obliquely trimmed distal aorta. Pure coarctation was present in 17 patients (group I); 24 infants had an additional ventricular septal defect (group II), and 39 patients had associated complex heart disease (group III). The overall early mortality rate was 26% (confidence limits 21% to 32%) (18% in group I, 17% in group II, and 36% in group III). The early risk declined with time and was 18% (confidence limits 12% to 26%) for the last 2 years (seven deaths in 39 patients). Follow-up was 100% for a mean of 19 months. Actuarial survival rate at 3 years was 82% for group I, 78% for group II, and 32% for group III. Recurrent coarctation (gradient greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg) occurred in six operative survivors (10%, confidence limits 6% to 16%) and necessitated reoperation in three. Freedom from recoarctation at 4 years was 88%. Because extended end-to-end aortic arch anastomosis provides adequate correction of the aortic obstruction and entails a low risk of restenosis, it is our procedure of choice in infants with coarctation and severe hypoplasia of the aortic arch.\r"

None of the most recent seven patients, however, have had a residual ascending-descending aortic gradient.

We performed a prospective study over 8 years in 100 consecutive hospital survivors who underwent Mustard (46 patients) or Senning (54 patients) operations between 1978 and 1982. Arrhythmia was analyzed by preoperative, postoperative, and serial follow-up Holter monitoring and standard electrocardiograms and was related to clinical outcome. Before repair, all patients were in sinus rhythm with a low incidence of arrhythmia. After repair, there was a gradual decrease in stable sinus rhythm during follow-up so that at a mean of 7 years after operation only 56% of patients having the Senning operation and 66% having the Mustard, with simple transposition, were in stable sinus rhythm on Holter monitoring. There was no significant difference between the two operations. Eleven patients (five after Senning [two simple, three complex], six after Mustard [five simple, one complex]) died during follow-up, four suddenly (two after Senning, two after Mustard). However, loss of sinus rhythm or the presence of arrhythmia on standard electrocardiograms or Holter recordings did not identify patients at risk for increased morbidity or mortality. Thus, even with current surgical techniques, gradual loss of sinus rhythm occurred after both Mustard and Senning operations. Because late death could not be predicted by electrocardiographic analysis, an alternative approach involving detailed hemodynamic and electrophysiologic measurements may be required to identify high-risk patients.\r"

An extracellular space washout technique was used to measure intracellular sodium and calcium in the two age groups after ischemia alone, after normothermic and hypothermic cardioplegia, and after cardioplegia with reperfusion. Although the intracellular ionic contents of nonreperfused adult hearts after 30 and 40 minutes of ischemia were identical, there was a twofold elevation in intracellular sodium level after 40 minutes of ischemia in the newborn hearts. Adult hearts arrested by normothermic potassium cardioplegia demonstrated no alteration in the intracellular ionic content, whereas in the newborn hearts, potassium cardioplegia produced excess intracellular calcium loading before reperfusion, which was greater than that occurring with ischemia alone. When hypothermia (12 degrees C) was combined with cardioplegic arrest, a prereperfusion influx of sodium and calcium was not observed in the newborn hearts, and ionic reperfusion injury was blunted in both newborn and adult hearts. These studies demonstrate that the newborn heart is more susceptible than the adult to both ischemia and cardioplegia. This may be due to age-dependent differences in transmembrane passive diffusion, sodium/calcium exchange, or calcium slow channel properties and suggests alternative myocardial protective strategies for the newborn infant.\r"

  ".U": "89013133\r", 
  ".W": "We assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine in 24 adult patients (12 controls, 12 treated) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for various cardiac operations. Deferoxamine was given both intravenously (30 mg/kg of body weight, starting 30 minutes before and ending 30 minutes after bypass) and as an additive to the cardioplegic solution (250 mg/L). Right atrial blood samples were taken before, during, and after bypass, and isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils were evaluated for their capacity to generate superoxide radicals after stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FLMP, 10(-7) mol) and phorbol myristate acetate (100 ng/ml). At the same sampling times, measurement of the plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable derivative of prostacyclin, was used as an index of membrane phospholipid breakdown. The two groups were not significantly different with regard to age, duration of bypass, and quantitative changes in polymorphonuclear neutrophil counts during the operation. Before bypass, the superoxide production of FMLP-stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils was comparable in the two groups. Conversely, after bypass, polymorphonuclear neutrophils harvested from deferoxamine-treated patients produced significantly fewer superoxide radicals than those of control patients (1.9 +/- 0.3 versus 3.7 +/- 0.2 nmol/10(6) polymorphonuclear neutrophils per minute, p less than 0.05). Stimulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils by phorbol myristate acetate yielded similar changes, as the postbypass superoxide production was 12.6 +/- 2.5 nmol/10(6)/min in control patients and 7.1 +/- 0.9 nmol/10(6)/min in those receiving deferoxamine (p less than 0.05). In contrast, plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were not significantly different between the two groups. We conclude that deferoxamine-exposed polymorphonuclear neutrophils have a decreased oxidative responsiveness, compatible with the fact that they may have been less \"primed\" by secretagogues released during bypass, as compared with cells of untreated patients. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that deferoxamine, by inhibiting iron-catalyzed free radical production, may limit the free radical-mediated amplification of the inflammatory response to bypass and as such could be effective in reducing the harmful effects of extracorporeal circulation.\r"

  ".U": "89013134\r", 
  ".W": "The hemodynamic manifestations of right ventricular dysfunction after ischemic injury depend not only on the severity of injury but also on the degree of coexistent left ventricular dysfunction. A better understanding of right ventricular failure and of optimal therapies has been hindered in part by lack of suitable experimental models of selective and differential ventricular injury. Therefore, we developed a technique of differential ventricular myocardial protection during a period of global cardiac ischemia and examined the effect of such an injury on intrinsic right and left ventricular myocardial function, metabolism, and regional blood flow. Twenty-six dogs were subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia while being supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. During ischemia, right and left ventricular myocardial temperatures were independently varied by selective ventricular endomyocardial thermal regulation. Nine dogs underwent right and left ventricular normothermic ischemia, eight underwent right and left ventricular hypothermic ischemia, and nine underwent right ventricular normothermic and left ventricular hypothermic ischemia. In both ventricles, normothermic ischemia resulted in greater depression of ventricular ability to generate stroke work as a function of end-diastolic dimension (p less than 0.05), greater depletion of myocardial adenine nucleotide content (p less than 0.05), and greater subendocardial reperfusion hyperemia (p less than 0.05). Myocardial temperature of the contralateral ventricle during ischemia had no effect (p = not significant) on intrinsic ventricular functional, metabolic, or regional blood flow response to injury. For a given degree of right ventricular injury assessed by these parameters, the degree of left ventricular injury could be independently varied by as much as 50%. This is a particularly suitable model for the investigation of acute right ventricular failure.\r"

  ".U": "89013135\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a reduction in plasma free triiodothyronine in patients undergoing cardiac operations. A previous experimental study in pigs demonstrated a marked inotropic effect when triiodothyronine was administered after a period of myocardial ischemia and cardiopulmonary bypass; this was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared with the mortality in control pigs. To clarify the effect of triiodothyronine on myocardial high energy phosphate stores and lactate, a series of experiments was done in baboons undergoing 3 hours of myocardial ischemia while supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. Seven baboons received no triiodothyronine and six received 6 micrograms of triiodothyronine at the end of the ischemic period. Seventy minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass, the myocardial adenosine triphosphate level was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the treated animals. In untreated animals, a steady increase in myocardial lactate occurred after cardiopulmonary bypass; by 120 minutes after ischemia (70 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass) there was a significant difference in lactate levels between the two groups (p less than 0.01). We postulate that a combination of global ischemia and depletion of triiodothyronine results in reduced mitochondrial function, inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased anaerobic metabolism and depletion of myocardial phosphates. Triiodothyronine replacement therapy leads to improved mitochondrial function and increased aerobic metabolism, which results in increased synthesis of myocardial phosphates. We suggest that there may be a place for the administration of triiodothyronine in patients undergoing cardiac operations with a prolonged myocardial ischemic period or in whom there is any evidence of low cardiac output after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".U": "89013137\r", 
  ".W": "Simultaneous bilateral pulmonary operations were done through median sternotomy in 29 patients with unilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, because bullae and blebs of the lung are frequently bilateral. Bullous lesions on the contralateral lung were encountered in eight of 10 patients (80%) in whom no roentgenographic evidence of the additional lesions had been detected preoperatively. Postoperative examination of percent vital capacity was satisfactory (more than 80%) in 21 of 23 patients followed up over a month after operation, and this suggested that simultaneous bilateral thoracotomy through median sternotomy does not lead to a much greater decrease in postoperative pulmonary function than does unilateral operation. To determine the indications for this method of treatment, we investigated the frequency of subsequent development of contralateral pneumothorax in 178 patients who initially had unilateral spontaneous pneumothorax. The occurrence rate of contralateral pneumothorax with visible bullae on chest roentgenograms was as high as 60% and 33.3% in patients in their teens and in those in their 20s, respectively. In conclusion, therefore, the bilateral operative approach should be considered, especially in teenaged patients with contralateral bullae, in whom the highest contralateral occurrence rate of 60% was found.\r"

  ".U": "89013139\r", 
  ".W": "This study was conducted to assess the protective effects of antegrade infusion of cardioplegic solution with simultaneously controlled coronary sinus occlusion on regionally ischemic myocardium after acute coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Twelve sheep were subjected to 1 hour of occlusion of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. Sheep in group I (n = 6) were subjected only to infusion of potassium crystalloid cardioplegic solution into the aortic root, whereas in group II (n = 6) a stitch was snared around the proximal coronary sinus for its subsequent occlusion during antegrade infusions of cardioplegic solution. All animals were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Five hundred milliliters of cardioplegic solution at 4 degrees to 8 degrees C was administered in three divided doses during the total cross-clamp period of 30 minutes. The occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was then released, and the animals were weaned from bypass and studied for an additional 4 hours. Coronary sinus pressure, myocardial temperature, regional function assessed by pairs of ultrasonic crystals, global function assessed by rate of rise of left ventricular pressure and cardiac output, and the area at risk and area of necrosis were determined. The heart was excised at the end of the experiment and stained. Animals treated by the technique of antegrade infusion combined with coronary sinus occlusion had more homogeneous myocardial cooling during cardioplegic infusions and better recovery of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure and regional segment shortening at 90 and 270 minutes of reperfusion than those treated with antegrade infusion alone (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The group treated by antegrade infusion of cardioplegic solution combined with coronary sinus occlusion had an area of necrosis/area at risk ratio of 40.5% +/- 1.2%; the antegrade infusion group, 58.3% +/- 4.1% (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that antegrade infusion combined with coronary sinus occlusion may be an improved method of global and regional myocardial protection in the presence of an occluded coronary artery.\r"

Plasma protein and free fatty acid concentrations were measured simultaneously with in vitro determinations of the protein binding of lidocaine, quinidine, and propranolol: immediately before operation, immediately on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, on arrival in the recovery room, and 12, 24, 72, and 120 hours postoperatively. Initial decreases in the concentrations of all proteins were followed by a rise in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein to 254% of baseline at 72 to 120 hours. The free fractions of drug were initially increased to 168% of baseline for lidocaine, 206% for quinidine, and 200% for propranolol and fell progressively with time, reaching sustained troughs of 65% for lidocaine, 50% for quinidine, and 57% for propranolol at 72 to 120 hours. Regression analysis indicated a major influence of changing alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations on free fractions of all three drugs, with a smaller effect of albumin that reached statistical significance only for lidocaine. There were no significant perioperative changes in plasma concentrations of free fatty acids when the in vitro effects of heparin were controlled. In conclusion, sequential changes in plasma protein concentrations after cardiac operations predictably alter the protein binding of lidocaine, quinidine, and propranolol and should be considered when interpreting total plasma drug concentrations.\r"

We studied 26 degenerated bovine pericardial valves that belong to a series of 55 prostheses explanted for various reasons. Age of the patients at implantation of the valve and other factors predisposing to primary tissue failure did not seem to significantly influence the results obtained. Mean implantation time was longer for aortic than for mitral valves (p less than 0.05). Also, the mode of failure was different for mitral and aortic prostheses. Tearing of one or more leaflets without mineralization was more frequent (p less than 0.0025) among mitral than among aortic specimens. Coverage of the valve cusps by a macroscopically visible host sheath was more extensive on the outflow than on the inflow aspect (p less than 0.0015 aortic valves; p less than 0.015 mitral valves). On radiological examination the majority of valves had diffuse and severe mineralized lesions. Collagen degeneration was the most frequent histologic lesion to be found in both mineralized and calcium-free valves. Calcification was also frequent and appeared as mineral deposits that extended between different collagen planes. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the almost complete lack of \"endothelium-like\" cover on any of the valves and exposure of the underlying fibrous components of the pericardial tissue in areas subjected to abrasion. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the collagen degeneration and disclosed electron-dense microparticles (probably mineralized) both in the extracellular space and within degenerated host connective tissue cells.\r"

With the patient under general anesthesia, a diagnostic mediastinoscopy was performed with endotracheal intubation. During the procedure, acute respiratory failure developed as a result of tracheal obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination of the patient in the supine position revealed almost total extrinsic compression of the trachea and no evidence of intraluminal disease. Reexamination of the trachea with the patient in sitting and semiprone positions showed resolution of the extrinsic compression and respiratory distress. Flow-volume curves obtained before treatment of the mediastinal mass (histologically diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma) disclosed major airway compression with the patient in the supine position; the abnormality disappeared after chemotherapy. The mechanisms responsible for tracheal compression by mediastinal masses during general anesthesia may include the following: (1) the effect of anesthesia on pulmonary mechanics, (2) the supine body position, (3) the elimination of glottic regulation of airflow by endotracheal intubation, (4) changes related to the surgical manipulation of the tumor itself, (5) the size and location of the mediastinal mass, (6) the young age of the patient, and (7) preexisting airways disease. Anticipation and prevention of potential respiratory complications and preparedness to treat them appropriately are important aspects of the management of these patients.\r"

This report suggests that low-density lipoprotein not only functions as an important carrier of cyclosporine in plasma but also facilitates transport of cyclosporine across the cell membrane by means of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Such a mechanism would explain (1) the similar tissue distribution of cyclosporine and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, (2) the increase in immunosuppression and toxicity with low total serum cholesterol levels, and (3) the relative absence of immunosuppression and toxicity with high levels of cyclosporine in the blood in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In addition to receptor-mediated uptake, a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier is suggested as an explanation of the high frequency of cyclosporine-induced central nervous system toxicity after liver transplantation. Cyclosporine-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial steroid 26-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the formation of bile acids from cholesterol and deficient in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, may cause or contribute to the observed central nervous system toxicity. It also may explain the similar clinical features of cyclosporine-induced central nervous system toxicity and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.\r"

These improvements provided greater specificity and sensitivity, but the assay was cumbersome and time-consuming. Despite these disadvantages, considerable information about the relationship of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid in normal and abnormal conditions was derived. The advent of monoclonal antibody technology and its application to the glycoprotein hormones resulted in the development of epitope-specific antibodies.

  ".W": "Although measurement of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone; TSH) by radioimmunoassay was a major advance in the laboratory diagnosis of thyroid failure--replacing the time-consuming TSH stimulation test--it was not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate reliably between euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients. Measurement of the TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) served this purpose, however. The recent development of TSH assays that are severalfold more sensitive and more specific than conventional radioimmunoassays has allowed distinction of euthyroid from hyperthyroid patients and eliminated the need for the TRH test. Although undetectable levels of TSH, compatible with hyperthyroidism, are occasionally noted in euthyroid patients with severe nonthyroidal illness and during the first trimester of pregnancy, false-positive results are less often recorded for TSH than for free or total thyroid hormone measurements. Measurement of TSH by sensitive immunoradiometric assay is currently the most useful first-line test of thyroid function in patients with suspected thyroid disease and, in addition, has a valuable role in monitoring the dose of thyroxine replacement therapy.\r"

The AB+ group had lower villous surface/volume ratio and small intestinal lactase concentrations than did the AB- group or age-matched controls. There was no significant difference between the two groups of RA patients in disease severity or treatment regimen. The findings suggest that the gut may play a more important part in the immunopathogenesis of some cases of RA than in others, and that the former may be identified by raised levels of IgA RF and wheat protein IgG.\r"

They were left to proceed in their conventional educational programme for the next 3 years, then reassessed. 47 (2%) children had attained satisfactory reading skills. The 37 (27 boys, 10 girls) who did not improve were diagnosed as having the syndrome of specific reading disability (SRD). The prevalence of SRD among the population surveyed was 1%, and the male to female ratio was 2.7 to 1. The prevalence was far lower than that reported in western countries. How the Arabic language is written and read probably contributes to the low prevalence of SRD among Arabic speaking populations.\r"

The combined injury group had significant increases in polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages, especially mature forms, compared with controls. These increases were higher than those expected from the individual injuries. The combined injury group had significantly greater spontaneous chemiluminescence than controls, again greater than that expected by the individual injuries. The chemiluminescence response to stimulation by opsonised bacteria was significantly higher in the combined injury group than in controls, but significantly lower than that in the smoke inhalation only group. The size of the alveolar cellular response to smoke and cutaneous burns suggests that lung damage follows from excess release of inflammatory mediators, exhaustion of the reserve of mature phagocytes and consequent reduced ability to fight bacteria, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure was measured in 4186 children aged 5 to 7 years in 9 British towns. 3 towns had high, 3 had intermediate, and 3 had low adult blood pressure levels observed in an earlier study of middle-aged men. Significant differences between the towns were found for the children's mean systolic blood pressure (range 96.7 to 102.4 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (range 55.9 to 60.3 mm Hg). The pattern of systolic blood pressure differences in children was similar to that observed in the study of middle-aged men (r = 0.65). The town mean systolic pressures in children show an association with standardised mortality ratios for cardiovascular disease in adults. The pattern of geographical differences in blood pressure observed in British adult men may have its origins early in life.\r"

However, in 11 of these 14, there was an increase in the number of clonogenic myeloma cells. This suggests that the treatment changed the myeloma cell population in the residual bone marrow. To be effective, subsequent chemotherapy should be aimed at destroying this population of myeloma cells.\r"

T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and proliferating smooth muscle cells made up most of the thickened intima. More importantly, S100-protein-positive dendritic cells were also present in the intima, especially during active inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation. These are phenotypic characteristics of tissue \"dendritic\" cells, pivotal accessory cells in T-dependent immune reactions. Their localisation in the arterial wall signals the presence of an ongoing immunological reaction directed at native constituents of the artery or at exogenous antigens which permeate the damaged vessel wall.\r"

  ".W": "Passing of the AIDS Prevention Bill, which demands the notification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) carriers, seems imminent in Japan. Its effect on people's willingness to be tested for the HIV antibody was assessed among heterosexual subjects (students, office workers) and groups at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (prostitutes, homosexual males) by means of a questionnaire. More than 70% of the 811 students and 509 workers replied that, if notification became mandatory, they would agree to be tested but 10% of the males and 17% of the females in these two groups would prefer testing at institutes not complying with the clause; all 198 prostitutes said that they would be prepared to undergo testing but 35% of them would prefer to go to non-complying clinics; 45% (410) of 902 homosexual males replied that they would refuse testing, and 65% of those who would agree to be tested (492) would prefer to go to non-complying clinics. These findings strongly suggest that when the bill is passed the greater the self-perceived risk of HIV infection the poorer will be the uptake of AIDS testing. Hence the bill would be counterproductive in the surveillance of potential HIV carriers.\r"

In vivo certain tissues with this receptor are aldosterone selective (eg, kidney and parotid) whereas others with the same receptor are not (eg, hippocampus and heart). Experiments in rats showed that 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (which converts cortisol to cortisone in man and corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the rat) was much more highly concentrated in aldosterone-selective tissues than in non-selective tissues. The localisation in the selective tissues was such that the enzyme could act as a paracrine or possibly an autocrine mechanism protecting the receptor from exposure to corticosterone. Autoradiographic studies showed that protection is lost when the enzyme is inhibited; 3H-corticosterone and 3H-aldosterone were bound to similar sites. These findings seem to explain why sodium retention, hypokalaemia, and hypertension develop in subjects with congenital deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD and those in whom the enzyme has been inhibited by liquorice.\r"

Snoring was quantified as number of snores per hour of sleep (snoring index). The data were analysed by multiple linear regression of diastolic blood pressure against age, body mass index (BMI), apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI, number of episodes per hour), snoring index, and SaO2. Diastolic blood pressure correlated significantly with BMI, AHI, and mean nocturnal oxygen saturation, but not with the snoring index. However, snoring index correlated with BMI, AHI, and mean nocturnal oxygen saturation. Snoring is thus not a direct risk factor for hypertension, but may influence blood pressure via its association with obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea, and nocturnal hypoxaemia.\r"

There have been wide variations in patients implanted and many differences in testing protocols for each device. In most instances, even a single patient may have unequal degrees of pathology and duration of deafness in the two ears. Implantation of a 3M/House device in the left ear and a Nucleus 22 device in the right ear of a 55-year-old woman, deafened to a similar degree and simultaneously in both ears by streptomycin, allows an opportunity to compare function under presumably similar circumstances. The Nucleus 22 cochlear implant was superior in this case in providing speech discrimination. Perhaps of greater interest, however, is evidence of a binaural effect. Presumably, central integration of sensory stimuli presented through two dissimilar processing strategies resulted in enhanced function on certain measures.\r"

Twenty cystic fibrosis patients whose ages ranged from 13 to 26 years were studied. Only one of these patients had a history of otitis. Minimal temporal bone pneumatization, as determined by computed tomography, was used as an indicator of childhood otitis. The computed tomography had been done as part of the medical evaluation of their symptomatic paranasal sinusitis. On the average, pneumatization volume was larger for the cystic fibrosis patients than for the normal population (p = 0.033, Student's t-test). That is, these data indicate that cystic fibrosis patients had significantly less otitis than the normal population. Assuming that these cystic fibrosis patients are representative, the data may imply that the gene for good musculoskeletal eustachian differentiation is linked with the gene for cystic fibrosis. The data also imply that poor mucociliary transport does not necessarily induce otitis media.\r"

A study of 236 patients was made to determine the effect of perioperative intravenous antibiotics and topical bacitracin irrigation on the incidence of these complications. Of the 236 patients, 170 (72%) underwent translabyrinthine resection of acoustic tumors, while 66 (28%) underwent retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section. Patients were divided into four groups: those who received no antibiotics, those who received perioperative intravenous antibiotics only, those who received topical bacitracin irrigation only, and those who received a combination of perioperative intravenous antibiotics and topical bacitracin irrigation. There were no untoward effects of either perioperative intravenous antibiotics or topical bacitracin. The results indicate that bacitracin irrigation reduced the incidence of wound infection from 9% to 2% (p less than 0.05); of cerebrospinal fluid leak from 12% to 5% (p less than 0.04); and of all targeted complications combined from 22% to 9% (p less than 0.006). Furthermore, the topical bacitracin irrigation only group showed a statistically significant reduction in wound infections compared to the perioperative intravenous antibiotic only group (p less than 0.02). The incidence of meningitis was statistically unaffected by any of our treatment protocols.\r"

Nuclear magnetic imaging supplemented CT scan findings, providing noninvasive localization of the defect. Preoperative impressions were confirmed at surgery.

Included among the strategies were the compressed analog processor of the present UCSF/Storz prosthesis and a group of interleaved pulses processors in which the amplitudes of nonsimultaneous pulses code the spectral variations of speech. For these patients, each with indications of poor nerve survival, test scores were significantly higher with the interleaved pulses processors. We believe this superior performance was a result of 1. the substantial release from channel interactions provided by nonsimultaneous stimuli and 2. a fast enough rotation among the channels to support adequate temporal and spectral resolution of perceived speech sounds.\r"

  ".U": "89013660\r", 
  ".W": "Despite advances in head and neck surgery, reconstruction of the pharynx and cervical esophagus continues to be troublesome. Classic pedicled flaps are often too bulky and difficult to position for repair of pharyngeal and esophageal fistulas. An ideal flap would be local, well-vascularized, compact, and capable of being sutured into a tension-free, water-tight seal. In selected cases, the sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap can meet these requirements in a single-stage procedure for repair of fistulas as well as selected cases of primary pharyngeal reconstruction. The use of this flap is described in five patients. Two patients underwent laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy that left inadequate mucosa for primary closure. A sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap was used to add width to the remaining mucosa. Both patients healed within 3 weeks and remained stricture free. Three other patients who underwent radiation followed by tumor resection and standard primary closure of the pharynx developed fistulas. Two fistulas were repaired successfully with the sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap, and both patients were able to eat a general diet on the eighth postoperative day. Reconstruction was also performed in dogs to histologically evaluate the epithelialization capacity of the periosteum. There was total epithelialization of the flap at 4 weeks after reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Four postlinguistically deaf adults were evaluated presurgically with a one- or two-channel vibrotactile aid and postsurgically with a multichannel, multielectrode, intracochlear implant. Although the vibrotactile aid provided awareness of sound and enhanced flow of conversation, benefit to lipreading was small on videotaped tests and speech tracking. Scores on recorded, sound-only speech tests were not significantly above chance except in discrimination of noise from voice. With the cochlear implant, benefit to lipreading was significantly greater than with the vibrotactile aid, and scores on sound-only tests were significantly above chance. Communication was markedly better with the implant than with the vibrotactile aid. In counseling those who get no benefit from a hearing aid, the results of this study provide data on the amount of benefit one- or two-channel vibrotactile aids provide postlinguistically deaf adults who are subsequently implanted.\r"

In this study we report the radiological, clinical, and pathological features of three carcinomas of the larynx, which show architectural and histopathological features similar to those previously described in superficial extending carcinoma of the hypopharynx. These cases were singled out from a series of 37 consecutive laryngectomy specimens of primary infiltrating laryngeal carcinomas that were uniformly studied by means of a whole-organ sections technique. Pathologically, these cases showed a clearly invasive growth through the basal membrane into the lamina propria and an entire or predominant, extensive, superficial type of spread; infiltration of underlying muscle or gland structures was restricted to a few microscopic foci, regardless of the presence of lymph node metastases. The present study demonstrates that infiltrating carcinomas with a preferential superficial type of growth may also be encountered in the larynx. Differences between the histological features of these carcinomas of the larynx and the histopathological spectrum of so-called early laryngeal cancer are emphasized.\r"

Antibodies against murine macrophages and granulocytes (anti-Mac-1), T-cells (anti-Lyt-1, anti-Lyt-2), and immunoglobulins (anti-IgM, anti-IgG, anti-IgA) were used. Mac-1 positive (Mac-1+) cells were observed at 6 hours post-challenge in the endolymphatic sac and cochlea and rapidly increased in both sites. Lyt-1+ cells gradually increased in the endolymphatic sac after challenge, peaking at 2 and 3 weeks post-challenge. In the cochlea, Lyt-1+ cells were detected at 1 day post-challenge and then increased. Lyt-2+ cells were detectable in the endolymphatic sac and the cochlea by 3 weeks post-challenge. The predominant immunoglobulin-bearing cell in the endolymphatic sac was IgG, followed by IgM, with IgA seen late in the response. We conclude that the inner ear has the capacity to mount an immune response through the accumulation of the needed immunocompetent cells for antigen processing, antibody production, and modulation of the response through T-helper and suppressor cell activity.\r"

The immediate and delayed effects of pulsed lasers on the common bile duct were also evaluated. The common bile duct demonstrated a high tolerance to laser-induced damage even when the laser was discharged directly into the bile duct wall. These results suggest that laser lithotripsy can be performed in humans with a high degree of safety and efficacy.\r"

  ".U": "89013672\r", 
  ".W": "To date, there are two fairly well-established alternatives for laser-induced shock-wave lithotripsy in clinical practice. The Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is distinguished by the high-stone selectivity of its coupler systems. The necessity of a coupler system and its fairly small conversion rate of light energy into mechanical energy present serious drawbacks. Furthermore, the minimal outer diameter of the transmission system is 1.8 mm. The pulsed-dye laser can be used with a highly flexible and uncomplicated 200-micron fiber. However, the laser system itself is more complicated than the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and requires a great deal of maintenance. Biological evaluation of damage caused by direct irradiation shows that both laser systems produce minor damage of different degrees. YAG laser lithotripsy with the optomechanical coupler was assessed in 31 patients with ureteral calculi. The instability and limited effectiveness of the fiber application system necessitated auxiliary lithotripsy methods in 14 cases. Dye-laser lithotripsy is currently being tested in clinical application. Further development, such as systems for blind application or electronic feedback mechanisms to limit adverse tissue effects, have yet to be optimized. Nevertheless, laser-induced shock-wave lithotripsy has the potential to become a standard procedure in the endourologic management of stone disease.\r"

The ureters were irradiated transrenally with an energy of 60 J coagulating all wall layers. Healing of the laser lesions nearly to normal in all animals was observed 4 to 6 weeks after treatment. The prevailing histological and physiological changes in the ureter are extremely slight and do not disturb the normal ureteral function. The results show the complete healing process of the ureter after laser coagulation and make the application of Nd:YAG laser in the upper urinary tract much more predictable.\r"

To define the relationship between laser-exposure duration and the strength of thermal welds made between separated layers of arterial wall, 360 1-cm discs of human postmortem aorta were lased for six different exposure intervals at three different temperature ranges, comparing shear strength of thermal welds in the different groups. Twenty discs were lased to achieve plateau adventitial temperatures of 95 degrees C-104 degrees C (group A), 105 degrees C-114 degrees C (group B), or 115 degrees C-124 degrees C (group C) at each of the exposure periods (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 sec). A 400-micron fiberoptic coupled to a 1.06 micron continuous wave neodymium:YAG laser was placed perpendicularly 8 mm above the luminal surface of each disc, which had been split midway between the intimal and adventitial surface and reapposed. Mean laser energy ranged 78-378 J delivered in a decremental stepwise fashion to achieve quickly and maintain the target plateau tissue temperature. Mean weld strength increased in relation to both achieved tissue temperature and laser-exposure duration, with at least 10 sec necessary, at temperatures greater than 95 degrees C, for reliable thermal welding. Laser exposure for greater than 20 sec provided no statistical increment in weld strength. In the anticipated clinical performance of LBA, these data suggest that when thermal fusion of disrupted arterial tissues is desired, a laser-exposure duration of 10-20 sec is optimal.\r"

Seven patients with rhinophyma were treated with the CO2 laser at the Lahey Clinic from 1982 to 1987. We used a laser handpiece with a variable spot size. With this technique, we found the laser to be an excellent cutting tool while simultaneously providing superior hemostasis. In the followup period of up to 4.5 years, the cosmetic results have been excellent. Thus, the CO2 laser has become our treatment of choice for the management of patients with rhinophyma.\r"

With this approach, changes in the hard and soft tissue components were concomitantly demonstrated; the method enabled preservation of the in situ relationship between these components. Following laser surgery, healing in the gingiva was delayed as suggested by the presence of epithelial ulcerations and dense inflammatory infiltrate. In the enamel and cementum the application of laser resulted in crater-like defects that could be avoided only partially by insertion of a tinfoil shield into the gingival sulcus. In the vicinity of the cementoenamel junction these defects were filled with epithelium or periodontal ligament fibers; the close proximity of the hard and soft tissues at the defect sites suggested occurrence of new attachment. Enamel defects located coronal to the gingiva contained bacterial plaque. These histologic results do not demonstrate any substantial advantage of laser over conventional knife gingivectomy. Such advantage may be accomplished with the design of a special intraoral handpiece and further experiments.\r"

The effectiveness of HpD-PT appears to be limited to superficial malignancies because of its inability to penetrate more than 0.5-1 cm. The mechanism of action has been demonstrated to result from the formation of toxic singlet oxygen and other oxygen radicals. Preliminary work suggested that the addition of other chemical agents known to produce toxic oxygen radicals may enhance the effect of HpD-PT. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effectiveness of HpD-PT in the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma with and without Adriamycin. Tumor kill was estimated by calculating the area of necrosis on photomicrographic sections. From this area, a radius of tumor necrosis was determined and compared among various control and experimental groups. HpD-PT was effective in this model when compared to control groups (radius of necrosis 3.79 +/- 0.97 mm vs. 2.60 +/- 1.26 mm, P less than .05). The addition of Adriamycin significantly increased the radius of necrosis when compared to HpD-PT (4.57 +/- 1.70 mm vs. 3.69 +/- 0.97 mm, P less than .01). From this work we conclude that HpD-PT demonstrates effective tumor killing in this murine model. The addition of Adriamycin significantly increased tumor kill.\r"

The retinal effects for each set of treatment parameters were estimated according to the predicted temperature rise and were found to be identical with our previous experimental results.

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to test the traditional assumption that during level walking all of the energy from oxidation of fuel appears as heat and no work is done. Work is force expressed through distance, or energy transferred from a man to the environment, but not as heat. While wearing a suit calorimeter in a respiration chamber, five women and five men walked for 70 to 90 min on a level treadmill at 2.5, 4.6, and 6.7 km.h-1 and pedalled a cycle ergometer for 70 to 90 min against 53 and 92 W loads. They also walked with a weighted backpack and against a horizontal load. During cycling, energy from fuel matched heat loss plus the power measured by the ergometer. During walking, however, energy from fuel exceeded that which appeared as heat, meaning that work was done. The power increased with walking speed; values were 14, 29, and 63 W, which represented 11, 12, and 13% of the incremental cost of fuel above the resting level. Vertical and horizontal loads increased the fuel cost and heat loss of walking but did not alter the power output. This work energy did not re-appear as thermal energy during 18 h of recovery. The most likely explanation of the work done is in the inter-action between the foot and the ground, such as compressing the heel of the shoe and bending the sole. We conclude that work is done in level walking.\r"

The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis using both traditional indirect indicators as well as a direct measure of muscle size. Seven male experimental (ME), 8 female experimental (FE), and 7 control subjects were studied before and after a 16-wk weight training program, in which ME and FE trained 3 days.wk-1 at 70 to 90% of maximum voluntary contraction using exercise designed to produce hypertrophy of the upper arm and thigh. Strength increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in ME and FE, respectively, on elbow flexion (36.2 and 59.2%), elbow extension (32.6 and 41.7%), knee flexion (12.8 and 24.4%), and knee extension (28.8 and 33.9%) tests. Absolute changes were significantly greater in ME than FE in 2 of the 4 tests, whereas percentage changes were not significantly different. Substantial muscle hypertrophy occurred in the upper arms of both ME and FE as evidenced by significant increases in upper arm circumference (7.9 and 7.9%), bone-plus-muscle (B+M) cross-sectional area (CSA) estimated by anthropometry (17.5 and 20.4%), and muscle CSA determined from computed tomography scanning (15.9 and 22.8%). Changes by ME and FE were not significantly different, except for the absolute increase in estimated B+M CSA, which was significantly greater in ME (11.2 vs 7.4 cm2). No muscle hypertrophy occurred in the thigh of either ME and FE as evidenced by non-significant changes in thigh circumference (1.7 and 2.3%), B+M CSA (4.9 and 6.1%), and muscle CSA (2.9 and 2.9%). Changes by ME and FE in body weight, fat-free weight, and fat weight were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements pre- and post-training included: maximum isometric, dynamic and isokinetic strength, in single-arm curl and double-leg press exercises; contractile properties of the elbow flexors; computerized tomography of the upper arms and thighs; muscle biopsies from the biceps brachii muscle of each arm in three subjects. Dynamic weight training was performed 3 times per week for 9 wk; exercises comprised unilateral arm curls (the contralateral arm acted as a control), and bilateral leg press. Strength increases in the trained arm were between 19 and 34%, and from -14 to +25% in the control arm; leg strength increased from 11 to 50%. Moreover, the pretraining maximum load could be lifted from 3 to 48 times in the trained limbs, and from 1 to 13 times in an untrained limb before fatigue. Contractile properties of the elbow flexors were unchanged with training, but pre-intervention, three subjects demonstrated incomplete motor unit activation. Most of the gains in strength were apparently due to a neural adaptation, rather than muscle hypertrophy. The tomograms and biopsy samples were inadequate to determine muscle, or muscle fiber areas with confidence; they did indicate however, no additional overt muscle structural damage. Strength training may be a potentially useful therapeutic option in the management of selected neuromuscular disorders.\r"

  ".W": "It is unclear whether the later menarche observed in competitive athletes is due to genetic factors or environmental factors related to intense prepubertal training. In order to investigate the importance of these factors upon the age of menarche (AOM), 263 competitive swimmers and 71 women with no athletic experience were asked to complete questionnaires concerning general health and reproductive development. Based upon their responses, similar questionnaires were sent to the sisters of both groups. Complete data were obtained from 140 athlete/sister pairs and 43 control/sister pairs. Results indicate that the athletes were older at menarche than their sisters, the non-athletes, and the sisters of the non-athletes (14.3 yr, 13.7 yr, 12.9 yr, and 13.0 yr, respectively). The sisters of the athletes were significantly older at menarche than the controls and their sisters, while the AOM of the non-athletic controls and their sisters did not differ. The interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that the sisters of the athletes were likely to be athletes (75%), while those of the control group tended to be non-athletic (74%). The athletes differed from their sisters who trained prior to menarche (13.9 years) and from those who did not engage in prepubertal training (13.1 years). Controls did not differ from any of their sister groups, nor did they differ from the untrained sisters of athletes. In terms of the similarity of the AOM within the sister pairs, the athletes/sisters and controls/sisters were equally similar. Significant correlations were observed between athletes and their sisters who trained prior to menarche and controls and their sisters who did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The experiment consisted of two conditions separated by at least 10 d. In the experimental condition (E) subjects remained awake for 60 h and in the control condition (C) the same subjects had 7 h of sleep per night. In both conditions subjects reported to the laboratory on the evening prior to d 1 and slept for 7 h. Physical performance testing was carried out on d 1 and again on d 3 after either two nights of sleep or two nights of SD. Results obtained on d 3 are expressed relative to d 1, the control day. Maximal isometric and isokinetic muscular strength and endurance of selected upper and lower body muscle groups, performance of the Wingate Anaerobic Power Test, simple reaction time, the blood lactate response to cycle exercise at 70% VO2max, and most of the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to treadmill running at 70% and 80% VO2max, were not significantly altered as a result of SD. These results suggest that sleep loss of up to 60 h will not impair the capability for physical work, a finding of considerable importance in sustained military operations which frequently involve the combination of both physical and mental tasks.\r"

Volume-matched infusions of placebo or 2 mg of naloxone were administered, in a randomized double-blind crossover fashion, prior to maximal graded cycle ergometer exercise testing. Esophageal (Tes), rectal (Tre) and oral (Tor) temperatures were measured before and after exercise, and Tes was continuously measured during exercise. Cardiorespiratory responses and maximal exercise duration were unaffected by naloxone. Naloxone did not significantly modify the Tes response or the highest Tre and Tor elicited by exercise testing. The rise in Tes (placebo: 2.2 +/- 0.4 degrees C; naloxone: 2.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and Tre (placebo: 1.1 +/- 0.2 degree C; naloxone: 0.9 +/- 0.4 degree C) was significant (p less than 0.001) with and without naloxone, whereas the rise in Tor was significant (p less than 0.05) with placebo (0.5 +/- 0.5 degree C) but not with naloxone (0 +/- 0.8 degree C, p greater than 0.5). These data indicate that although 2 mg of naloxone might alter heat exchange in the oral cavity during exercise, it does not modify the actual core temperature response. Therefore, insofar as this dosage of naloxone may be used to examine the functional role of opioid-mediated mechanisms, our findings are not tenable with the hypothesis that endogenous opioids play a role in maintenance of thermal homeostasis during exercise.\r"

Therefore, to determine the cardiovascular and thermal differences between training and triathlon performance, nine male triathletes performed a simulated 75-min (40 km) control bike and a 40-min (10 km) control run at 70% of maximal oxygen uptake. Control data were compared to data derived from a simulated triathlon (0.8-km swim, 75-min bike, and 40-min run). Results demonstrated that prior swimming significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) triathlon cycling work output (191 +/- 4.2 to 159 +/- 7.6 W) producing mean differences (P less than 0.05) in oxygen uptake (3.18 +/- 0.1 to 3.01 +/- 0.11.min-1), ventilation (84.7 +/- 4 to 80.4 +/- 4.21.min-1), stroke volume (128 +/- 7.1 to 118 +/- 3.5 ml.min-1), cardiac output (20.7 +/- 1.2 to 18.9 +/- 0.8 l.min-1), mean arterial pressure (105 +/- 3.8 to 96 +/- 7.9 mm Hg) and rectal temperature (38.2 +/- 0.2 to 38.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C).

To determine if similar adaptations occur in humans, single motor units (SMUs) and surface electromyographic activity (EMG) were recorded from the right biceps brachii before and immediately after a 5-s 25% or 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), while subjects held a handle (0-1% MVC) attached to a force transducer or maintained a 2% MVC for 30-60 s. Of 26 SMUs recorded, 15 increased, 4 decreased, and 7 showed no change in firing frequency (mean increase: 5 imp/s, P less than 0.01). Twelve SMUs had lower recruitment force thresholds after contraction. There was no significant treatment effect for the % MVC intensity. The postcontraction surface EMG power spectrum broadened, increased in amplitude, and contained a higher frequency component than the control contraction power spectrum. Changes in recruitment and/or frequency coding were reflected in the raw EMG records. Findings agree with previous reports in animals of contraction-induced potentiation of subsequent submaximal muscle contractions. Such acute adaptations in spinal neuromuscular pathways would function to optimize force output to a submaximal range of neural input frequencies.\r"

Deformation data were collected using high-speed film from a group of recreational athletes and a group of national team athletes (volleyball) performing a drop jump. The differences in maximum deformation between the various surfaces tested were about 100% from the lowest to the highest value for the recreational athletes and about 1,000% for the national team athletes. The differences in deformation were primarily influenced by the number of sleepers used and/or by construction elements which are close to the top of the surface (top layer, second layer, add rubber padding, number of sleepers). The one sleeper system consistently had the lowest values of maximum deformation.\r"

Daily training distance was increased from 4,000 to 9,000 m.d-1, and intensity was maintained at 94% of VO2max. Three of the swimmers were unable to tolerate the increased training load, and they did the same distance at slower speeds. Swimmers completed the Profile of Mood States, a muscle soreness scale, and a 24-h history each morning prior to the first of two daily training sessions. Changes across days were evaluated statistically with a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Significant (P less than 0.005) increases occurred in the ratings of exercise intensity, muscle soreness, depression, anger, fatigue, and global mood disturbance, along with a reduction in general sense of well-being. Swimmers were classified as \"responders\" or \"non-responders\" on the basis of distress patterns using separate physiological and psychological criteria, and these classifications were performed in a double-blind setting. Close agreement (89%) was achieved between the psychometric and physiological judgments, and the physiological results appear in related papers. It is concluded that significant psychometric changes occur with an intense 10-d training regimen, and these alterations resemble those observed in swimmers exposed to increased training across several months. These findings underscore the potential utility of monitoring mood states in the prevention of staleness.\r"

When second and third stimuli are superimposed on the rising phase of a twitch in a normal muscle, a less-than-linear summation of force and stiffness generation (early depression) is followed by a more-than-linear summation (later facilitation). Dystrophic muscles showed a smaller early depression and a greater later facilitation of force and active muscle stiffness. Many of these phenomena can be predicted from a simple model of Ca2+ release and binding to troponin.\r"

Contralateral R1 could be produced by facilitating maneuvers such as a gentle contraction of the orbicularis oculi and conditioning stimulus of the median nerve. In addition, changing the position of the stimulating anode to the midline evoked these responses that were abolished by blocking the contralateral supraorbital nerve, confirming its peripheral origin. We conclude that crossed trigeminofacial pathways probably exist in normal subjects, but in some instances contralateral peripheral trigeminal ophthalmic sensory fibers may be stimulated, giving rise to a contralateral R1 response.\r"

Serum CK is elevated in mdx mice at all ages, with highest activities at 5 weeks. The Ca content of dystrophic skeletal muscle is increased at all ages, whereas no clearly abnormal trend in muscle Mg levels was observed. Noncollagen protein (NCP), which was used as a reference base, is significantly diminished in muscle from 10- and 23-week-old mdx animals. Isolated mitochondria from mdx mice have elevated calcium content and decreased respiratory control ratios with NAD-linked substrates pyruvate/malate. The findings are distinct from those in dystrophic mice, strain 129/ReJ, but similar to observations in dystrophic hamsters and Duchenne muscular dystrophy and reflect the occurrence of overt muscle cell necrosis.\r"

Microinjection of 0.3 micrograms of potassium tellurite [K(2)TeO(3)] into the endoneurial space of rat tibial nerve causes a rapidly progressing focal conduction block as measured by the disappearance of the evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the intrinsic foot muscles following stimulation proximal to the injection site. Conduction block was fully established within 6 hours and persisted for approximately 7 days, followed by the appearance of low amplitude, long latency, temporally dispersed potentials. The proximal CMAPs increased in amplitude and decreased in latency and temporal dispersion until normalization by 28 days after injection. The distal CMAP showed a minimal decline in amplitude. Morphological observations showed splitting of myelin, especially in the paranodal regions, followed by accumulation of myelin debris in Schwann cells and macrophages. Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, this in vivo model provides a unique opportunity to study the electrophysiological and morphological correlates of an acutely evolving demyelinative process.\r"

  ".W": "Branching of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers in normal and regenerating personal and soleus nerves was studied by light and electron microscopy. There were at most 2% more myelinated and 13% more unmyelinated axons in the distal as compared with the proximal nerve segments. Two to four weeks after a crush lesion the distal axons became 2-3 times more numerous; thereafter their number decreased. The number of axons in the proximal nerve segment did not change. The number of myelinated sprouts in most regenerated nerves equalled the number of myelinated fibers in the proximal nerve, while the number of unmyelinated axons after 12-19 weeks was 18-60% higher than normal. Branching was not restricted to the crush region. The results indicate that following a crush lesion all axons branch but only branches of unmyelinated fibers persist for a prolonged period of time. It is tentatively suggested that regenerating axons branch when searching for a target and that when contact is made with the target this prevents additional branching and eliminates redundant branches. Myelinated axons are guided by existing Schwann cells, whereas unmyelinated axons do not follow predetermined pathways; this may explain their greater tendency to form permanent branches.\r"

  ".W": "Myosin ATPase (pH 9.4) differentiates two muscle fiber types in healthy human muscle, while diseased muscle often contains intermediate density fibers (IDFs). We evaluated the possibility that, since almost all IDFs in pathologic muscle biopsies are changing type after reinnervation by a motor axon of the opposite type, IDFs are useful in diagnosis. In a retrospective study of 208 muscle biopsies, IDFs were seen as often as were esterase-positive angular atrophic fibers (EPAAFs). In denervation identified by EMG and by histopathology, EPAAFs and IDFs were found much more often than were other indicators. Of biopsies diagnosed without use of IDFs as minimal histologic change or no pathologic diagnosis, 16% had IDFs with sparse EPAAFs and 21% had IDFs without EPAAFs, suggesting mild denervation with rapid reinnervation. IDFs correlate well with EPAAFs, identifying reinnervated versus denervated fibers. Type grouping reveals completed reinnervation change that may be many years old, while IDFs are changing type when biopsied and thus reveal recent reinnervation and preceding denervation. IDFs usefully belong with the histochemical indicators used to evaluate muscle disease.\r"

The contacts were used in various combinations for precise localization of changes in conduction velocities and excitability along the extent of normal nerves. In this paper the particular characteristics and limitations associated with cuff-electrode recordings of neural activity are discussed. The nerve action potential was recorded using a tripolar configuration with a central lead flanked by two shunted leads at symmetrical distances. This configuration records the spatial derivative of the action potential and rejects potentials from sources outside the cuff. The voltage changes are restricted by the silicone cuff, and the dynamic range is therefore very high, allowing detection from single myelinated fibers to whole nerve responses. The electrodes are well suited for following the development of regeneration and degeneration following experimental lesions.\r"

Regeneration after crush alone was compared with crush 5 mm proximal to a tight constriction of the nerve. Regeneration was monitored by the progression of excitability along the electrode arrays on the tibial and plantar nerves. The sensitivity was sufficient to record the averaged activity in single nerve fibers allowing detection of the earliest regeneration. The diameters of the fastest regenerating fibers were estimated from the conduction velocity proximal to the site of crush. Both after crush alone, and after crush constriction, small myelinated fibers regenerated in front of large fibers. The rate of elongation after crush alone was 3.2 mm/day, whereas it was slower (P less than 0.02) distal to crush + constriction (2.2 mm/day). In both lesions, the extrapolated delay to onset of regeneration was 8 days. In observations up to 300 days after crush, maturation was delayed or impaired by the constriction, and the compound nerve action potential had a smaller amplitude and a dispersed shape. Transverse sections of nerves after crush + constriction showed a diminished number of large and an increased number of small fibers compared with crush alone, possibly due to persistent branching of regenerated fibers. After both crush alone and crush + constriction, regenerated fibers had similar g ratios, suggesting that myelination developed fully in fibers of diminished diameters.\r"

Benign and malignant tumors were identified from the pathology records of all Israeli hospitals and from Israeli national cancer and death registries. Doses of radiation to the neural tissue were retrospectively estimated for each patient (mean, 1.5 Gy). Sixty neural tumors developed in the patients exposed as children, and the 30-year cumulative risk (+/- SE) was 0.8 +/- 0.2 percent. The incidence of tumors was 1.8 per 10,000 persons per year. The estimated relative risk as compared with that for 10,834 matched general-population controls and 5392 siblings who had not been irradiated was 6.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 11.6) for all tumors and 8.4 (confidence interval, 4.8 to 14.8) when the analysis was restricted to neural tumors of the head and neck. Increased risks were apparent for meningiomas (relative risk, 9.5; n = 19), gliomas (relative risk, 2.6; n = 7), nerve-sheath tumors (relative risk, 18.8; n = 25), and other neural tumors (relative risk, 3.4; n = 9). A strong dose--response relation was found, with the relative risk approaching 20 after estimated doses of approximately 2.5 Gy. Our study confirms that radiation doses on the order of 1 to 2 Gy can significantly increase the risk of neural tumors.\r"

Among 242 men in whom cancer developed, the mean total iron-binding capacity was significantly lower (61.4 vs. 62.9 mumol per liter; P = 0.01) and transferrin saturation was significantly higher (33.1 vs. 30.7 percent; P = 0.002) than among 3113 men who remained free of cancer. The risk of cancer in men in each quartile of transferrin-saturation level relative to the lowest quartile was 1.00, 1.01, 1.10, and 1.37 (P = 0.02 for trend). The serum albumin level was significantly lower in men in whom cancer developed than in those who remained cancer-free. Among women, those in whom cancer developed did not have significantly lower total iron-binding capacity or higher transferrin saturation than those who remained cancer-free. However, a post hoc examination of 5367 women (203 with cancer) yielded a relative risk of 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.9) associated with a very high transferrin saturation (greater than or equal to 36.8 percent, a value in the highest quartile among men); in 5228 women with at least six years of follow-up (149 with cancer), the relative risk associated with transferrin saturation above this level was 1.5 (1.0 to 2.2). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that high body iron stores increase the risk of cancer in men. The possibility that a similar association exists in women requires further study.\r"
