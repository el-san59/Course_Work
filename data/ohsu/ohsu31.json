The clinical diagnosis of hypertension requires demonstration of sustained blood pressure elevation. We conducted a survey that contrasted the results of these two approaches to determining the prevalence of hypertension and the extent to which hypertension is detected and treated. A multistage random sample of 2737 people was selected, examined and interviewed on up to three occasions. Rates of hypertension prevalence and control were computed from data from one, two and three visits. The prevalence of hypertension was overestimated by 30% when the diagnosis was based on data from one rather than three visits, the rates being 149 and 115/1000. The prevalence of undetected hypertension was overestimated by 350%, the rates being 27 and 6/1000. The proportion of subjects with controlled hypertension was underestimated by 23%, at 56%, compared with 73%. These results confirm the need for follow-up measurements to provide a valid assessment of hypertension control in the community.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of Canadian hospitals providing obstetric care was undertaken to assess preparation, protocols, training and staff availability for neonatal resuscitation. Of the 721 hospitals contacted 577 (80%) responded. The reported availability of written guidelines for resuscitation varied greatly, depending on hospital size and proximity to a tertiary care centre. Many hospitals, especially those with 300 births or fewer annually, reported that they depend on family physicians or nurses to start and to continue neonatal resuscitation. Approximately one third of the hospitals had written guidelines for summoning personnel for additional help, and one third used a list of maternal or fetal indications for the presence of a physician specifically for the care of the infant at birth. Of 200 hospitals 138 (69%) had to summon additional medical help from outside the institution, 60% at all times. A neonatal resuscitation team in which members' roles were defined was established in 22% of the hospitals. Few hospitals held rehearsals for resuscitation. Nurses were permitted to perform intubation in 21 hospitals (4%), 7 of them in Alberta. National professional bodies should develop guidelines for training and skill maintenance, and hospitals should develop protocols for maintaining equipment and for neonatal resuscitation team activities, including regular practice. Training should be improved in family practice and obstetrics programs, and consideration should be given to training senior obstetric nurses and respiratory therapists in intubation of neonates.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 16 patients with optic nerve glioma treated between 1961 and 1984 were reviewed. All patients except two had extension of tumor beyond the chiasm to the hypothalamus, adjacent brain and/or along the posterior optic tract. Eleven of 16 cases were biopsy-proven, two patients had craniotomy and visual inspection but no biopsy was performed, and in two cases the biopsy was not diagnostic. Fourteen patients received radiation therapy, usually consisting of 50 Gy in 5 weeks (range 40-56 Gy), one patient was treated surgically and one with chemotherapy. With a follow-up of 1 to 20 years, 7 of the 14 patients irradiated are alive, three patients are dead of disease at 3, 6 and 9 years post-treatment, three were lost to follow-up at 1, 8, and 8 years, and one is dead of intercurrent disease at 5.5 years. Overall vision was improved in five patients and stable in seven following treatment. In two patients, vision could not be evaluated because of young age at presentation. Four patients had recurrences. One was retreated with 30 Gy in 3 weeks and shows no evidence of disease at 20 years. The three other patients died of their disease. There is controversy over the best treatment for these patients. Based on these results and a review of the literature, the authors recommendation is to irradiate tumors with extension beyond the chiasm at the time of presentation rather than waiting for increasing symptoms because function that is lost may not always be recovered. Chemotherapy needs to be further investigated but holds promise, especially for the younger children.\r"

Four women had radial scars on the ipsilateral side in the breast tissue available from the primary surgical procedure or at autopsy. One woman had an invasive breast cancer with morphologic features compatible with but not diagnostic of transition from a radial scar. Of the six radial scars with carcinoma in situ occurring in three women, three were of ductal and three of lobular type. In the remaining cases only radial scars with a benign appearance were found except for two with atypical hyperplasia. The frequency of radial scars was significantly higher in women with fibrocystic disease (55%) compared to women without (24%). Contralateral primary invasive and in situ breast cancer occurred in 68%. No difference in the frequency of radial scars in women with and without breast cancer was found and radial scars were not associated with any specific type of breast cancer. Our findings do not indicate a higher malignant potential of radial scars than of fibrocystic disease. It is suggested that only radial scars containing high-risk epithelial changes such as atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ are associated with an increased risk of subsequent breast cancer development.\r"

The apparent predilection for the left atrium is unique among cardiac malignancies. Careful pathologic study is necessary to differentiate the uniformly fatal MFH of the heart from the more common benign atrial myxoma.\r"

The authors calculated age- and sex-specific mortality rates for gastric cancer from 1950 through 1979 for whites using data from US Vital Statistics and population estimates from the US Census Bureau. Whereas sex ratios based on crude mortality rates showed a decrease over time from 1.7 in 1950 to 1.5 in 1979, similar ratios based on age-adjusted mortality rates showed an increase from 1.8 to 2.1. An increase in mean age at death over time was consistent with the increase in age of the population. The authors conclude that factors responsible for the decrease in gastric cancer mortality in the United States appear to have affected males and females equally. The overall data do not support the emergence of a new form of gastric cancer with a sex ratio or age pattern different from that found in the past.\r"

All patients had skin lesions as a primary manifestation of the disorder. Three patients had simultaneous regional lymph node involvement documented by the findings of subsequent biopsies. The majority (five patients) had solitary nodules involving the skin of the head and neck region. Three of the skin biopsy specimens were classified as lymphoblastic lymphoma, two large cell lymphoma, two mixed small and large cell lymphoma, and one small cleaved cell lymphoma. Disseminated disease subsequently developed in four patients in an interval that ranged from 4 to 30 months after diagnosis. The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 56 months, and median survival was 56 months. A literature review of 33 previously reported patients and our eight patients indicate that: skin of the head and the neck region is the most common site of involvement (56%); the majority of lymphomas are diffuse (93%); lymphoblastic lymphoma is the predominant type (53%), with a high proportion showing a non-T-cell phenotype; Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease of the skin are extremely rare; and most patients presented in an early clinical stage (Stage IE 56%, Stage IIE 21%), and prolonged disease-free survival was seen mostly in Stage I patients. The cumulative probability of survival for Stage I patients at 24 months was 0.71; while for Stages II to IV patients combined, it was 0.33 at 26 months.\r"

This disease predominantly occurs in the elderly (age range, 56-92 years), and affects men rather more frequently than women (men: 44, women: 28). The clinical presentation varied, and included bruise-like lesions, dusky plaques, chronic edema or cellulitis, ulcerated nodules, pyoderma, and infected conditions. Due to lack of clinical awareness and problems with histologic assessment, delays in diagnosis were frequent. The majority of the tumors arose in the upper part of the face or scalp. Less commonly, the central part of the face was affected while only three tumors developed in the mandibular region. Overall the prognosis was poor; one half of the patients died within 15 months of presentation. Only 12% of the patients survived 5 years or more. Patients with lesions that were less than 10 cm in diameter responded better to treatment and statistically survived longer than those with larger lesions, emphasizing the crucial importance of early diagnosis. There is some indication that men, younger patients, patients with lesions on the central part of the face survived longer, but this was not of statistical significance. The histologic differentiation of the tumors at presentation also was of doubtful prognostic significance. Despite the overall poor prognosis, radical radiotherapy (mostly wide-field electron-beam therapy) in seven patients resulted in the apparent eradication of the local skin disease and prolonged survival of the patients. Pulmonary metastases developed 10 years later in two of those patients, however, but the face and scalp remained tumor-free.\r"

All three regimens were equally effective as initial chemotherapy: CFP 26/46 (57%); CFPMV 31/48 (65%) and CA 26/47 (55%) (P = 0.61) with the least toxicity for the CFP regimen. Median duration of remission were 9.5, 11, and 9 months, respectively. Complete responses were almost identical in all three regimens: 4/46 (9%); 6/48 (12%) and 5/47 (11%) (P = 0.94). CFPMV was an effective regimen as second-line therapy: 11/33 (33%) or third-line therapy: 7/21 (33%). The CA regimen was equally effective as second-line therapy: 8/25 (32%), suggesting that intensive regimens provide an effective rescue therapy, as well in previous responders as in nonresponders. Initial intensive regimens have not substantially altered long-term survival in the whole group of treated patients, Arm II (CFPMV----CA----CFP) 17.6 months; Arm III (CA----CFP----CFPMV) 12.3 months when compared with initial moderate regimens Arm I (CFP----CFPMV----CA) 16.6 months (P = 0.24). The same lack of difference in survival was noticed in responder patients in each arm: Arm II 19.0 months; Arm III 16.0 months versus Arm I 22.0 months (P = 0.13). Our data suggest that a moderate regimen is as effective as more intense regimens for induction therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with less toxicity, preserving the opportunity for an effective rescue therapy with intensive regimens in second or third-line chemotherapy.\r"

Eight patients received CVF as palliation for recurrent or metastatic disease. A sustained complete response (107+ months) was observed in one patient; one partial response and one mixed response each also were observed. In four patients disease stabilized, and in one disease progressed. Thirteen patients received six courses of CVF in the adjuvant setting after surgery and radiation for either primary or locoregional recurrent disease. Recurrences developed in two of seven patients with primary disease and three of six patients with recurrent disease with a median follow-up 45 months (range, 20-108+). Recurrence rate and time interval to recurrence were comparable to those of well-matched historical controls. Distant metastases have not developed in patients treated with CVF in the adjuvant setting, whereas distant metastases had developed in historical controls within comparable periods of follow-up. Serious toxicities were not encountered in any patient. The authors conclude that CVF is a well-tolerated combination chemotherapy program with activity in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck. This regimen, however, has not had a major impact in the adjuvant setting in preventing recurrent disease.\r"

None of the neoplasms involved the anterior visual system. The radiation dose ranged from 3000 to 4650 rad and the oral CCNU dosage from 300 mg to 1050 mg. Patients 1 and 2 also received other chemotherapeutic agents. Patient 3 who was treated only with oral CCNU and cranial irradiation died. At autopsy the brain showed a widely infiltrating residual high-grade glioma as well as patchy coagulative necrosis with swollen axons and dystrophic calcifications. The optic chiasm showed severe demyelination, axonal loss, and hyalinized vessels. Synergism between oral CCNU and radiation may account for the blindness produced.\r"

Over the last 6 years, 29 patients with unresectable primary or metastatic sarcomas were treated using a combination of intravenous chemical radiosensitizers and high-dose irradiation. Twenty-two of 29 patients achieved clinical local control, with six patients having a complete clinical response. The time to tumor response is often several months or longer, which is in contrast to other tumor histologies (carcinomas, lymphomas), where tumor response usually occurs over several weeks. Several large tumors have shown only a minimal tumor response, yet were found to be sterilized in posttreatment biopsy or autopsy examination. Of 15 patients with primary sarcomas without metastases, 11 patients (73%) remain free of local tumor progression from 12 to 83 months. Adult high-grade sarcomas can be controlled with high-dose radiotherapy and intravenous radiosensitizers, although the precise role of these agents is unclear.\r"

Measurements of DNA content were performed in 100 cells each in intramucosal, submucosal, muscular, and subserosal parts of a tumor. According to dispersion on the DNA histogram, DNA ploidy patterns were divided into low and high ploidy groups. Fourteen tumors (70%) showed the same ploidy in every layer (homogeneous DNA ploidy), 13 (65%) were low ploidy and, 1 (5%) was high ploidy. Heterogeneity of DNA ploidy was observed in the remaining six tumors (30%), which showed low ploidy in the mucosa, but high ploidy was observed in one or two deeper layers. In the six with heterogeneous DNA ploidy, there was more frequent metastasis to the lymph nodes (100%) and to the peritoneum (67%) than those with homogeneous DNA ploidy (50% and 21%, respectively). Cytophotometric DNA analysis of cells of undifferentiated gastric tumors suggested that there may be behavioral changes, depending on the degree of penetration into the gastric wall.\r"

  ".W": "To establish a new histologic classification with better correlation with patient prognosis, the histologic features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were correlated with prognosis and clinical stage among 494 patients who had been followed a minimum of 5 years after initial radiotherapy. A slight modification of World Health Organization (WHO) classification by the separation of spindle cell variant from the nonkeratinizing (NK) and undifferentiated carcinomas (UD) provided a better prognostic correlation: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (KS), spindle cell carcinoma (SP), round cell carcinoma (RC), and mixed cell carcinoma (Mix, or NK); 5-year survival rates were 21%, 41%, 51.8%, and 54%, respectively. This prognostic distinction was further improved by dividing the three nonkeratinizing carcinomas (SP, RC, and Mix) into two subtypes each, according to the degree of cell anaplasia and pleomorphism: Type A (with marked anaplasia and/or pleomorphism), and Type B (with moderate or little anaplasia). The three Type A carcinomas had very similar 5-year survival rates (33.3 to 38.6%), as did the three Type B carcinomas (60% to 71.8%). Therefore, a working formulation for the malignancy of NPC emerged: high-grade malignancy (KS; 5-year survival, 21%), intermediate malignancy (Type A carcinomas, 5-year survival, 30%-40%), and low-grade malignancy (Type B carcinomas, 5-year survival rate, 60%-72%). The prognostic distinction remained true after stratification by clinical stage. Therefore, the histologic condition of the tumor of NPC correlated with patient's prognosis.\r"

Therefore the authors reviewed pathologic and clinical data in 59 patients treated for TCT of the renal pelvis or ureter. Capillarosclerosis was found in nine cases (15%) of the TCT group but not in any of the cases selected as controls. Capillarosclerosis is suggested as a valuable marker, which always should be looked for in bladder biopsy specimens. Whenever present it should arouse suspicion of analgesic abuse, and the associated increased risk for developing TCT of the renal pelvis or ureter should be borne in mind.\r"

Ninety-eight modified neck dissections were performed in 86 patients over a 5-year period. The procedure entailed removal of the submaxillary and jugular chain nodes while the posterior triangle was not dissected. Thirty-two patients received postoperative radiotherapy. Lymph nodes were histologically positive in 55 of 98 dissections (56%). Among 72 determinate patients, recurrence in the dissected neck occurred in 8 of 38 with positive nodes and none of 34 with negative nodes (P less than 0.05). These recurrences occurred in patients who had clinically palpable nodes preoperatively. Postoperative radiotherapy did not significantly alter the overall recurrence rate or survival of patients with positive nodes. Cumulative disease-free survival at 5 years was 70% overall. It is concluded that the modified neck dissection described is appropriate in the clinically negative neck or when regional disease is early (i.e., N1) and located in the submandibular triangle. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given if more than one node is involved histologically or if extracapsular spread is present.\r"

Modified radical mastectomy was performed after three courses of chemotherapy followed by another six courses of the same chemotherapy. Locoregional radiotherapy concluded the treatment program. All patients responded clinically to the initial chemotherapy. Modified radical mastectomy provided a direct histologic control of the effectiveness of the treatment and, in case of tumor persistence, allowed cytoreduction. No scarring problems were observed and postoperative chemotherapy could be administered without any delay. Radiotherapy was decisive for locoregional tumor control which was obtained in all patients who were treated strictly according to the protocol. Dermal lymphatic involvement represented in this series of clinical inflammatory breast carcinoma no pejorative feature and positive hormone receptors failed to be of predictive value for response to treatment. Considerably variable tumor persistence after initial chemotherapy and the results relative to local tumor control advocate surgery as part of a combined modality approach for inflammatory breast carcinoma.\r"

However, attention has in the past been focussed mainly on surgical aspects of the procedure. Whereas, equivalent interest in chemotherapy considerations has been lacking. A group of 15 patients have been treated by hyperthermic isolated perfusion for advanced melanoma of the limbs. The chemotherapeutic agent used was cisplatin. The follow-up period was 6 to 60 months. None of these patients had any sign or symptoms of toxicity from the drug. Twelve of these 15 patients are free of disease currently. There was one case of mortality due to unrelated cause and two cases of mortality due to disseminated disease which developed 6 months and 30 months, respectively, posttreatment. Since not uncommon toxic side effects from other drugs used for this procedure is significant, these results suggest that cisplatin may be used as an alternative chemotherapeutic agent in isolation perfusion for advanced melanoma of the extremities.\r"

Patients treated with CAV had a complete response rate of 21% in contrast to 36% for those receiving alternating therapy. The median survival for all patients was 9.8 versus 11.3 months, for limited disease 11.1 versus 13.4 months, and for extensive disease 8.9 versus 9.9 months, all in favor of the alternating treatment. Two-year survival rate for all patients was 6% versus 9%, for limited disease 11% versus 14%, and for extensive disease 3% versus 6%, all preferring the alternating treatment mode. Progression-free survival demonstrated a strong correlation to the extent of response irrespective of the treatment regimen applied. Toxicity included 11 lethal and 8 life-threatening complications with a higher frequency in the alternating treatment arm. These results suggest that alternating treatment of SCLC with different drug combinations is more effective than sequential application of CAV.\r"

  ".U": "87130556\r", 
  ".W": "The administration of an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet to rats significantly enhanced gastrointestinal toxicity associated with methotrexate administration compared with rats fed a regular chow diet. Chemotherapy induced enteritis is potentially enhanced by the abrasive effect of bile acids on the susceptible cells of the small bowel mucosa. This study evaluated the interactions of methotrexate and cholestyramine in vitro. An additional goal was to evaluate the effects of cholestyramine on animal survival and drug pharmacokinetics in rats given an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet. In vitro binding of cholestyramine to methotrexate increased in a linear fashion at varying concentrations of both drugs in phosphate buffer solution (r greater than 0.84, P less than 0.001) and in bile which was not influenced by pH (range 5-8). The addition of cholestyramine to an elemental liquid diet significantly improved survival following methotrexate administration (20 mg/kg IP bolus) compared with rats fed an elemental liquid diet alone (P less than 0.02). Both elemental liquid diets, either with or without cholestyramine, delayed serum and biliary clearance of methotrexate up to 72 hours compared with rats fed a regular chow diet. However, rats fed an elemental liquid diet with added cholestyramine had significantly lower levels of methotrexate in serum from the systemic and portal venous circulation at 48 hours (P less than 0.03) and in bile at 48 (P less than 0.02) and 72 hours (P less than 0.05) following methotrexate administration. The addition of cholestyramine to an elemental liquid diet improves survival and reduces gastrointestinal toxicity following methotrexate administration, by binding methotrexate in bile and reducing the delay in systemic clearance of the drug. By binding to intraluminal bile acids, cholestyramine may also have a locally protective effect on the mucosal cells of the small intestine following methotrexate administration. Cholestyramine may be of clinical benefit in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate regimens as an adjunct to leucovorin rescue.\r"

Overall, a regression of malignancy was observed in 39 of 132 evaluable patients (29.5%) and the most favorable results were obtained for patients with lung cancer. Irrespective of whether the tumors were primary or secondary lesions or recurrences, favorable results were obtained in patients whose tumors were in the lung, liver, lymph nodes, and soft tissue. No relationship was found between an objective response to TBHT and histologic types of the tumors. There was no clear relationship between an objective tumor response and the nature of the simultaneous chemotherapy during hyperthermia. Antitumor effects were not evaluable in 36 patients (21.4%). Of these 36 patients, 33 died before evaluation could be made; 24 died of various complications and 9 died of cachexia without complication. The mortality increased in proportion to the reduction of the performance status of patients before TBHT. These results indicate that TBHT should be used as therapy for patients whose tumors are in the lung, liver, lymph node, and soft tissue and then only on patients in generally good condition.\r"

Prognostic subgroups and patterns of treatment failure were investigated. The 5 year actuarial survival and disease-free survival was 91% and 75% respectively for the entire group. For Stage IA patients, the 5 year survival and disease-free survival was 92% and 86% respectively, whereas for those in Stage IIA the respective figures were 86% and 65%. Individuals with greater than four sites of involvement at initial presentation; extensive mediastinal adenopathy; hilar or extramediastinal extension to lung, pleura or pericardium, had a poorer 5 year actuarial disease-free survival (43%-60%) than those without these factors (70%-85%). Of the 122 patients, there were 26 relapses: nine infield failures; two concurrent infield and systemic failures; nine marginal recurrences, and three relapses occurring systemically and three in nodal groups not irradiated. Following relapse, 17 patients were salvaged with chemotherapy. Two patients are alive with disease and seven patients died of Hodgkin's disease. Patients with less extensive mediastinal adenopathy and supradiaphragmatic nonmediastinal presentations can be satisfactorily treated with mantle and paraaortic irradiation, whereas patients with extensive mediastinal adenopathy receive six cycles of multiagent chemotherapy before irradiation.\r"

Detailed neurologic examinations were followed by bone x-rays, bone scans, and MRI. In 12 patients there were focal neurologic findings. Bone x-rays and bone scans were diagnostic for metastatic disease in 10 cases; MRIs were consistent with metastatic spinal-epidural disease in all 16 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bone involvement in three patients whose x-rays and bone scans were both negative indicating a higher degree of sensitivity. In six patients thecal compression was obvious on MRI; in three of these previous myelograms had been interpreted as negative. These early results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful tool for diagnosing early spinal-epidural metastases.\r"

Radiated and nonirradiated tissues were compared as were cases with and without laryngeal framework involvement by cancer. Morphologic changes in ossified laryngeal cartilage showed that invasion is a largely indirect process dominated by local bone destruction with osteoclasts operating in front of the advancing tumor. Morphometric studies indicate that framework invasion correlates significantly with both increased numbers of osteoclasts and increased bone resorption. An original finding here was that radiation therapy resulted in similarly increased osteoclast activity among cases without framework involvement by cancer. In these cases radiation appeared to act independently of tumor in producing osteoclast activation.\r"

These lymphomas were distributed primarily into only three of the recognized major histologic types: lymphoblastic (LB), 106 (47%); undifferentiated (DU), 49 (21%); and diffuse histiocytic (DH), 72 (32%). These patient groups were found to differ in several ways: the LB lymphomas contained most of the patients under two years of age; the LB lymphomas tended to present in higher clinical stages; the LB lymphomas tended to involve lymph node groups and the bone marrow more often than did the DU and DH lymphomas; and the DU lymphomas had a greater tendency for gastrointestinal tract and other major organ system involvement. The complete remission rate of 96%, for the LB lymphomas was better than for either the DU or the DH lymphomas. The disease-free survival of the LB lymphomas was significantly better than the DU group, but not the DH group. The LB were histologically divisible into three subtypes: convoluted (C), nonconvoluted (NC), and large cell variant (LCV). The C and NC subtypes preferentially involved the mediastinum and peripheral lymph nodes initially, while the LCV tended to involve the abdomen. However, none of the subtypes differed in clinical stage. The complete remission, and the disease-free survival rates between these subtypes were not statistically different.\r"

Median age at presentation was 10 years for B; 12 years for NB; 6 years for NOS; and 10 years overall. Univariate analysis of clinical and laboratory data at presentation, yielded no significant differences between B, and NB patients. Complete remissions were obtained in 75% of the patients, and there were no significant differences in complete remission rate among the different morphologic subtypes of undifferentiated lymphoma. There were no significant differences in the estimated disease free survival between B, and NB patients. No morphologic parameters were identified that were predictive of prognosis.\r"

In 8 of the 11 patients these studies were positive, suggesting breast as the primary tumor site. Estrogen (30 to 445 fmol/g) or progesterone (30 to 1059 fmol/g) receptors, or both, were positive in seven cases. Although a breast carcinoma was subsequently found in all 11 patients, receptor studies on the primary tumor could not be done in every instance. The authors concluded that performing steroid hormone receptor assays on axillary metastases from occult tumors not only may provide information regarding the identity of the primary tumor but also may be the sole opportunity to determine its hormone receptor status.\r"

The findings of this study provide conclusive evidence that Paget's cells, regardless of their location, are adenocarcinoma cells. Intracytoplasmic mucin is scanty in Paget's cells within the nipple, but typically plentiful in the extramammary sites where the cells are frequently signet-ring cells. The common mechanism for the evolution of Paget's disease is extension of cells from an underlying carcinoma, but the possibility that some cases, particularly in the vulva, develop from intraepithelial precursors cannot be excluded.\r"

Hypercalcemia could not be accounted for by parathyroid hormone or prostaglandins E levels, which were in the normal range, or by 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which were low. Our findings are consistent with the mechanism proposed by several investigators, that the malignant T-lymphocytes produced an osteoclast-activating-factor-like substance that caused osteoclast proliferation and hypercalcemia.\r"

A comparable cellular yield was obtained by both techniques. In a series of 635 benign and malignant breast tumors examined in 1981 with fine needle alone, insufficient cellular yield was recorded in 5.5% of the lesion. The same incidence (6%) was recorded with aspiration techniques in 7877 benign and malignant mammary tumors examined from 1954 to 1980. With the new technique, trauma is reduced and a better perception of the tumor and of its consistency is directly obtained.\r"

Surgery was performed on the basis of FNAB cytologic diagnosis that was positive or suggestive of malignancy and/or a suggestive clinical history. Surgery also was performed in cases of cold nodules with negative FNAB results that did not respond to 6 months of suppressive thyroxine therapy. A correlation of cytologic findings with histologic findings was possible in 415 patients who underwent surgery: the evaluation of FNAB results yielded better results when suspicious cytologic findings were considered to be positive (2.4% false-negative, 86.3% sensitivity) rather than negative (6.5% and 65.7%, respectively). FNAB has become a useful procedure in the study and diagnosis of thyroid diseases. It is a simple, rapid diagnostic procedure that may be used to expedite the management of malignant lesions.\r"

The pathologic categories were endodermal sinus tumor (eight patients), embryonal carcinoma (three patients), pure dysgerminoma (three patients), adenocarcinoma (three patients), and malignant granulosa-cell tumor (one patient). In 1973 and 1975, respectively, two patients with endodermal sinus tumors were treated with surgical removal with or without radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy with vincristine (Vc) and actinomycin D+ cyclophosphamide + Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (ACAdr); both developed local recurrence within 12 months and died of tumor. Since 1977, four of six patients with endodermal sinus tumors have been managed successfully with surgery followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin (P), bleomycin (B), vinblastine (Vb), and ACAdr; none received RT. One died of recurrent tumor and the other died of congestive heart failure attributed to Adriamycin (Adr). All three patients with embryonal carcinoma were well after surgical excision alone (one patient) or surgery and chemotherapy with cisplatin + bleomycin + vinblastine (PBVb) + ACAdr (two patients). Treatment of the remaining seven patients included excision alone (two patients) or excision and chemotherapy (five patients) with various combinations of Vc, ACAdr, and P. One patient with granulosa-theca cell tumor also received whole abdominal RT (3000 rad by external beam), and died of congestive heart failure attributed to Adr. The other six children were free of detectable tumor 16 months to 8 years from diagnosis. Chemotherapy with PBVb and actinomycin D + cyclophosphamide (AC) should be used in the postoperative management of young persons with malignant ovarian tumors. Adr is of doubtful value and may be considerably toxic. RT is of limited use and usually is not indicated.\r"

The most frequent cohort pattern was characterized by increases up to the generations born between 1920 and 1930, followed by stabilization or a slight decrease. This pattern was evident for total cancer mortality in men, and for several common sites, including larynx, lung, esophagus, bladder, female breast, and ovary. Only four sites (pancreas, pleura, intestines in both sexes, and kidney in men) showed cohort values still rising in more recent generations. Stable cohort and period of death curves were observed for cancers of the prostate and testis, whereas trends were steadily going down for neoplasms of the stomach, and (cervix) uteri. Finally, there were a few discontinuous trends (e.g., in the case of brain neoplasms, leukemias, and lymphomas), which probably reflect different effects of improvements in diagnosis and/or treatment. Period of death values increased for lung and other tobacco related sites (chiefly in males) and, up to the early 1970s, for a few other common sites, including intestines, and the female breast. Downward trends over the calendar period were evident for cancers of the stomach and of the (cervix) uteri. Therefore, total cancer mortality trends over the calendar period of death were moderately increasing for men, and slightly decreasing for women.\r"

The PI used in this study was first reported from Munich, West Germany, and is calculated from standard histologic sections by multiplying the MM thickness in millimeters (Breslow method) by the number of MM mitoses per square millimeter. A PI value of less than 19 versus greater than or equal to 19 was found to be a significant and independent prognostic variable for Stage I MM when compared with seven other predictive variables (including Breslow thickness). These PI intervals identified a subgroup of patients with MM of intermediate thicknesses (1.50-3.49 mm) whose significantly worse survival would not have been anticipated if prognosis were determined by Breslow thickness alone. For example, patients with MM 1.50 to 2.49 mm thick have a 5-year survival rate of 84.1% determined by Breslow thickness alone; however, among these patients exists a subgroup with PI greater than or equal to 19 whose survival rate is only 57.6%. This study verifies the additive usefulness of the PI in predicting survival rates of patients with Stage I cutaneous MM.\r"

The last six patients had the cyclophosphamide infusion lengthened to 7 days, and the cytarabine increased to 14 doses. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Seven patients (47%) obtained a complete remission and six patients (40%) a partial remission. Median duration of all remissions has been 7.0 months with a range of 1 to 32 months. Toxicity has been limited to primarily myelosuppression with no hemorrhagic cystitis, central nervous system (CNS), hepatic, or pulmonary toxicity noted. Gastrointestinal toxicity was mild, with no effect on nutritional status noted. Median duration of complete responders was 8.5 months. Thus, Hi-COAP demonstrates promising efficacy with minimal toxicity in RAAL and warrants further exploration in multiinstitutional trials.\r"

Eleven patients are dead of disease, and two patients are alive without evidence of disease at 49, and 51 months. Extending the doxorubicin dosage to its tolerable limits did not appear to result in improved efficacy in patients with metastatic mixed mesodermal uterine sarcomas.

The change in CEA levels in the portal blood of 40 patients during operation was also examined in relation to histopathologic variables. CEA levels of portal blood (with a mean of 26.6 ng/ml and positive rate greater than 5 ng/ml, 59.1%) were significantly higher than those of peripheral blood (8.1 ng/ml, 33.3%). Elevation of CEA levels in portal and peripheral blood was most highly correlated with the venous invasion. Although the levels in the portal blood were related to six other histopathologic variables including tumor size, tumor differentiation, node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, invasive layer of the colorectal wall, and Dukes' classification except tumor location. CEA levels rose from 19.4 ng/ml and 40% to 43.6 ng/ml and 90.2% respectively following operative stimuli to cancer lesions with venous invasion. However, the levels did not rise in the lesions without the invasion. CEA levels of peripheral blood were as low as 5 ng/ml in three out of eight patients with liver metastasis. However, the levels in portal blood were much greater than 5 ng/ml in all of the patients. These results suggest that CEA may be hematogenously drained by the portal system via the draining vein from the cancer cells in the invasive veins but not by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system.\r"

In 31 patients (24 without evidence of cancer and seven with history of cancer and cytologically negative fluids), the fluids were diploid by flow cytometry. One fluid with atypical cells from a lymphoma suspect was also diploid. Flow cytometry of 26 cytologically cancerous fluids disclosed aneuploid DNA patterns in 16 and diploid patterns in ten. Feulgen cytophotometry of 11 of these fluids (three aneuploid, eight diploid) was performed on nuclear preparations identical to those used in flow cytometry and on restrained smears used for visual analysis. The analysis was performed in two modes: as a study of 500 sequential nuclei in an automated system, mimicking flow cytometry, and visually selected large, presumably malignant nuclei. In nine of the 11 cases, the DNA content of visually selected cancer cells was aneuploid, even though this DNA pattern was not evident in the analysis of 500 sequential cells. In two cases, both diploid by flow cytometry, the Feulgen analysis confirmed the presence of cancer cells in the diploid range. In samples of 10(4) nuclei representing a mixed population of cells occurring in effusions, the presence of aneuploid cancer cells may not be disclosed by conventional flow cytometry. A larger sample of cells, a detailed analysis of DNA histograms, and perhaps sorting of select cells in the hypertetraploid range, may prove essential before flow cytometry can be accepted as a diagnostic tool in the laboratory in the assessment of effusions.\r"

All three men were diagnosed within six months of their 30th birthday. HLA typing revealed that all four siblings share the DR5 antigen, and two siblings share HLA-B27. Chromosome analysis on peripheral lymphocytes revealed no abnormalities. A detailed, structured interview failed to elicit evidence of unusual exposures. The EBV antibody titers are probably within the normal range and none of the family had antibodies to HTLV-III. Observations on this family suggest that genetic factors play a greater role than environmental factors in the etiology of familial Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The ulcerative type, which usually is accompanied by deep ulceration with extensive fibrosis. The erosive type, which is infiltrated by extensive lymphoid hyperplasia in the propria mucosa and submucosa. The latter two types represent the reactive state in response to chronic gastric ulcer or inflammation. One of four ulcerative GPLs, however, was associated with focal malignant lymphoma which accounted for one of the fifteen GPL studied. Although there is a low incidence of malignant lymphoma among GPL patients, pseudolymphoma should be considered as a precursor lesion with malignant potential.\r"

Between 1975 and 1985, six children with pineocytomas were treated at our institution, and pineocytomas constituted 11% of all newly diagnosed pineal region tumors. The clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of these six patients with pineocytomas are presented. Initial treatment for these children included craniospinal plus supplemental local radiotherapy (three), local radiotherapy alone (one), or radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy (two). Four of six patients had tumor recurrence a median of two years after diagnosis. Three patients had leptomeningeal dissemination, one at the time of diagnosis and two following therapy. Our findings suggest that: biopsy is necessary to distinguish pineocytomas from other pineal region tumors; radiation therapy alone is inadequate; and these tumors are aggressive in the pediatric population, with a high propensity for leptomeningeal dissemination.\r"

Obstruction, pain, and weight loss of relatively short duration were prominent symptoms. Tumors tended to be located distally in the stomach, and scirrhous in appearance. Histologically, diffuse type lesions were more common than intestinal or other type tumors. Radiographic evidence of disease was usually present in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal series. Endoscopy with biopsy was a valuable diagnostic tool. Resectability in this group was not less than that achieved for all ages, however, only one patient has survived for five years. Advanced stage lesions predominated and were associated with poor survival. Earlier stage lesions in this age group appear to bear a more favorable prognosis.\r"

ABC, and TS and TE categories were newly adopted. The former distinguishes tumor multicentricity, and the latter indicates the clinical tumor stage. Tumors arising in one organ and homolaterally are categorized as A, while those in both organs (ureter and renal pelvis) and/or in the bladder are B, and bilateral tumors are C. TS represents the tumors of pT1 and pT2, and TE represents pT3, and pT4. Tumors belonging to pB showed a poorer prognosis than pA tumors. The TS and TE staging system clearly reflected the histopathologic stage, and produced significant differences in relative survival rates. Regarding various prognostic factors, our series gave the same results as reported by other investigators. However, it should be stressed that female patients showed a poorer prognosis than male patients.\r"

The elevation was most pronounced among newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, with hypertension of moderate or greater severity, and for sites that have been described in clinical reports as being capable of producing a rise in blood pressure. It is tentatively concluded that the causal direction is from cancer to hypertension, rather than the reverse. If this conclusion is correct, the associations that have been reported between cancer mortality and hypertension may be due to an effect of blood pressure upon survival from cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Effective treatment modalities for Stage III and IV squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck are limited and seldom result in long term survival. The improved results with cisplatin containing chemotherapy have been encouraging and represent an additional therapeutic modality for head and neck cancer. To estimate the effectiveness of concomitant radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) initiated a Phase II study for patients with advanced nonresectable SCC of the head and neck. In addition, the diagnostic biopsy specimens were collected. Two pathologists reviewed and scored the biopsy specimens for a number of histologic parameters, including degree of keratinization, nuclear pleomorphism, frequency of mitoses, inflammatory and stromal reaction, pattern of invasion and vascular involvement in order to identify potential prognostically important patient subgroups. A total of 114 patients were evaluated for complete clinical responses (CR). These were achieved in 76% for all head and neck sites (ALL), and in 72% of the patients excluding nasopharyngeal and sinus cancers (REST). Evaluation of histopathologic parameters through multivariate analysis identified the presence of keratin as the most significant in predicting CR. Non-keratinizing SCC had CRs of 98% (ALL), and 94% (REST), as compared with 64% and 67% in the patients with keratin producing neoplasms (P less than 0.001 and 0.05) respectively. Survival at 24 months was found to be improved in the non-keratinizing SCC (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis also identified the frequency of mitoses as being important in predicting for CR in patients with keratin in the biopsy findings. Biopsy specimens from ALL patients with two or more mitotic figures per high-power microscopic field had 76% CRs, in comparison with 46% when none or one mitotic figure was observed (P = 0.02). In the restricted group of patients (REST), the CR was 77% in the high mitotic figure group as opposed to 45% in the lower rate group (P = 0.03). However, this significant difference in CR rates did not translate into improved survival for the high CR subset.\r"

One patient was followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and urinary steroid secretion. The MRI gave a good visualization of the tumor. Measurements of relaxation times showed a significant decrease in T1 values. The urinary steroid profile showed an increased secretion of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroids and tetrahydro-11-deoxy-cortisol. Treatment with streptozocin and o,p'DDD initially increased 16-oxygenation of dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-en-3 beta,17 beta-diol, followed by a decrease in the secretion of all urinary steroids.

A clinicopathologic analysis of 17 patients with XLP who developed ML was performed. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 4.0 years (range, 2-19 years). The median overall survival was 12 months (range, 1-216 months). Eight patients had maternally related male relatives with ML. Other phenotypes of XLP were documented in male relatives of the remaining nine patients. Common presenting symptoms were fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nine patients had \"B\" symptoms. All ML occurred at extranodal sites. The intestines, most commonly ileocecal, were involved in 76.5% of the cases. Thirteen patients had localized disease (Stages I and II) and four patients had advanced disease (Stages III and IV). A diffuse histologic pattern of growth was observed in all cases. The distribution of histologic subtypes included small noncleaved (41.2%), large noncleaved (17.6%), immunoblastic (17.6%), small cleaved or mixed cell (11.8%), and unclassifiable (5.9%) ML. Surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy resulted in disease-free survivals of up to 192 months in eight patients (median 114 months; range, 12-192 months). Eight of 17 patients (47%) are still alive. A median survival of only 6.0 months (range, 1-12 months) was observed in the nine patients who died. No residual ML was found at autopsy. The small noncleaved subtype had an adverse prognosis (seven of nine deaths versus one of eight survivors; P less than 0.05). Bacterial infection was the major cause of death (seven of nine patients). Characteristics that distinguish ML in XLP from other ML include a maternal family history of XLP, early age of onset, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, post-EBV infection, and ileocecal involvement.\r"

All were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), one being admixed with cholangiocarcinoma. The relationship of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers with iron and ferritin was evaluated in liver tissues from patients with primary liver cancers. The serum HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) positive rate was 80.0% (32/40). Cirrhosis was observed in 97.5% (39/40). HBsAg was identified in 82.5% (33/40) of uninvolved liver, and 35.0% (14/40) of HCC tissues (P less than 0.001). HBcAg (hepatitis B core antigen) was detected in 25.0% (10/40) of liver, and 7.5% (3/40) of HCC tissues (P less than 0.05). Stainable iron was found in 65.0% (26/40) of unaffected livers, and 10.0% (4/40) of HCC tissues (P less than 0.001). Ferritin was demonstrated in 75% (30/40) of non-neoplastic liver, and 40% (16/40) of HCC tissues (P less than 0.001). Twenty-two of 33 HCC patients (66.7%) with HBsAg positive cells in their livers also showed stainable iron. Of 16 patients positive for ferritin in HCC cells, iron was found in only two. Iron was found in nine of ten patients with HBcAg in non-neoplastic hepatocytes (P = 0.056); a finding compatible with the hypothesis that iron accumulates in cells replicating HBV. The other results indicate that: immunohistologic ferritin in HCC is not due to increased stainable iron; tumor cells may produce ferritin; polyclonal antibodies to human liver ferritin react better with non-neoplastic hepatocytes than with HCC cells; the high prevalence of HBsAg and cirrhosis in HCC suggests that HBV plays a major etiologic role in hepatocarcinogenesis in China; and one case of HCC is attributed to Schistosoma japonicum infestation via cirrhosis.\r"

A modified classification scheme of the WF was used in order to define cytologic subtypes more specifically, enabling 65 possible diagnostic choices. Data analyses by computer revealed that at least four out of five diagnostic agreements were observed in 290 cases (78.9%). Similar agreements were observed in more than 80% of the cases for most of the categories of the WF, excepting diffuse small cleaved (73.3%), diffuse mixed (64.2%), diffuse large cell (76.5%), and immunoblastic lymphoma (70.2%). Agreement rates between American and Japanese pathologists did not demonstrate statistically significant differences against expected values.

This study was performed to determine the incidence of occult and clinically apparent metastases of lung cancer to the small intestine. Small bowel metastases were present in 46 of 431 patients with primary lung cancer who underwent autopsy during an 11-year period. These patients had an average of 4.8 metastatic sites. Small bowel metastases were present in 12 of 31 (39.0%) patients with large cell carcinoma, 13 of 108 (12.3%) with adenocarcinoma, six of 73 (8.0%) with small cell carcinoma, 15 of 199 (7.5%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and none of 20 with undifferentiated carcinoma. During the same interval, six of 78 patients undergoing small bowel resection for metastatic tumor had lung cancer primaries. Among the nine previously reported clinical cases of small bowel metastases and the six in this series, 14 were operated upon for small bowel perforation and one for obstruction. Nine patients died perioperatively, and no patient survived longer than 16 weeks. These data demonstrate that the incidence of lung cancer metastases to the small bowel is higher than is clinically apparent. Lung cancer metastases to the small bowel often present as intestinal perforation and indicate a poor prognosis; surgery is indicated for palliation.\r"

Better understanding of the mechanisms resulting in the relative resistance of skeletal muscle to metastases could have bearing on therapeutic interventions for prevention of metastases. Three patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastases in the proximal limb muscles are presented. Skeletal muscle metastases may present as painful masses in the proximal skeletal muscles. Subcutaneous and osseous metastases which are more frequent must be excluded by careful physical examination, bone scan and x-rays. Computed tomography (CT) can confirm the location of the tumor within the fascial planes of skeletal muscles and may help in the accurate delineation of the radiation portal. The tumor can be diagnosed and more common causes, such as hematoma or abscess, can be excluded by thin needle aspiration with cytologic examination. Clinical recognition of metastases in this unusual site is important based on our report that total tumor dose of 3600 to 4200 cGy of radiation in fractions of 300 cGy, 5 days a week, is effective in palliation of swelling and pain.\r"

Some unique features of the Denver area, especially the unusually high background levels of ionizing radiation, warrant comparisons with rates generated from other regions. A total of 348 childhood cancers were identified in white (including Spanish surname) and black children, with the 200 cancers among males resulting in higher rates than for females (148 cases) for total cancers and selected major cancer types (leukemias, glial brain cancers, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). Compared with other geographic areas, Denver rates were very similar, with no marked excesses or deficits except for an increase in male endocrine cancers. Rates for Spanish surname children were very similar to the rates for other whites.\r"

The purpose of this study was to establish which hemodynamic variables are most strongly associated with compliance. Hemodynamic measurements were performed on 41 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Cardiac outputs were determined by thermodilution, and pressures were measured in the ascending aorta with a catheter-tip manometer. Compliance was calculated from a mono-exponential fit of diastolic decay pressures. Pulse pressure(PP), stroke volume(SV), age, systolic blood pressure(SBP), and cardiac output(CO) were significantly related to compliance. The quotient SV/PP was a good estimate of compliance, as was a first-order function of both SV and PP. There appear to be specific clinical correlates of arterial compliance, as well as ways to estimate arterial compliance on the basis of conventional hemodynamic measurements when direct calculations are not possible.\r"

  ".W": "A previously developed method of programmed postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP) was assessed in eight patients with medically refractory unstable angina, as a predictor of functional restoration resulting from surgical revascularization. Prior to coronary arteriography, left ventricular segmental wall motion was determined during ventricular pacing and the first postextrasystolic beat following an extrasystole. The postextrasystole was induced at an interval calculated to occur at a time where ventricular preload was identical to the regular paced beat (isolength interval). The left ventricular wall was divided into six segments, each subscribing one area of the ventriculogram, and correction for rotation during systole was made. Of 48 segments, 21 were considered \"jeopardized,\" due to greater than 70% reduction in cross-sectional lumen of the serving coronary arteries. Fifteen of these 21 responded to PESP, increasing their segmental area ejection fraction from 44 +/- 5 (paced \"normal\" beat) to 56 +/- 6 (postextrasystolic beat) (p less than 0.05). Following surgical revascularization, these segments showed an improvement in their baseline area ejection fraction from 44 +/- 6 to 58 +/- 5 (p less than 0.05). Six jeopardized segments that failed to respond to PESP prior to revascularization showed functional deterioration after revascularization. The 27 non-jeopardized segments (which were not revascularized) also showed functional improvement, suggesting improved collateral flow. This study demonstrates that isolength postextrasystolic potentiation obtained with a standardized pacing protocol may be used to predict the potential for improvement in cardiac function following surgical revascularization. Our results also show that lack of PESP predicts loss of left ventricular myocardial function following revascularization.\r"

All individuals included in this study were natives of the Mosul area of northern Iraq. The coronary arteries were examined by injection-corrosion and unaided dissection. Almost all (90%) of the anomalies observed were in the right coronary artery. Nine hearts (8% of total sample) possessed ectopic ostia in the right coronary sinus for the right coronary and conus arteries. The occurrence of a separate conus artery appears to be anomalous rather than ubiquitous as widely reported in the literature. One specimen had separate origins for the left circumflex and anterior descending arteries from the left coronary sinus. The patterns of coronary artery distribution were classified as left (14%) and right (46%) preponderant, and balanced (40%), following Schlesinger [Schlesinger, Arch Pathol 30:403-415, 1940]. The present study adds to the growing body of data on intrapopulation frequencies of coronary artery variants among non-Europeans and supports the contention that postpartum development may modify the pattern of coronary divergence from the aorta. As the number of non-Caucasian patients undergoing surgical treatment for ischemic or valvular heart disease increases, additional comparative data on racial, sexual, and ontogenetic variation of the coronary arteries and their aortic ostia are required to improve the care of these patients.\r"

An ischemic defect area score was computed from quantitative exercise thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphy; this estimation of the amount of ischemic myocardium was used to classify the patients in group I (n = 8; score less than 15%, mean 6.7 +/- 2.5%) and II (n = 10; score greater than 15%; mean 27.2 +/- 8.9%). Hemodynamics and metabolism were studied in basal state. No patient had anginal pain during the study, and the extent of angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) was comparable in the two groups. Heart rate, aortic pressure, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen uptake were also similar in both groups. However, ejection fraction was reduced in group II (51 +/- 13 vs 63 +/- 5%; p less than 0.01) and LV relaxation was impaired as shown by the increase in time-constant of isovolumic pressure fall (55 +/- 16 vs 44 +/- 6 ms in group I; p less than 0.05); the LV end-diastolic pressure was also increased in group II (19 +/- 8 vs 10 +/- 4 mmHg in group l; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, in group II, myocardial lactate uptake was reduced (4 +/- 19 vs 30 +/- 29 mumole/min in group I; p less than 0.01) and the productions of alanine and glutamine were augmented (-7.5 +/- 4.4 vs -4.6 +/- 1.6 mumole/min in group I; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this report is to demonstrate that the angiographic appearance of the anastomotic vessels in such cases is entirely different from that which obtains in cases of obstructive coronary artery disease. The author notes the rarity of angiographic visualization of homocoronary communications in normal right coronary arteries and emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing these from the homocoronary collaterals found in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\r"

In order to avoid this problem, a double catheter technique was employed in seven patients involving nine procedures consisting of a standard 8 or 9 French angioplasty guiding catheter and a standard 7 French angiographic catheter to prevent coronary flow reduction and to permit improved coronary artery visualization. In two of the procedures, the second diagnostic catheter also permitted the prevention of potential plaque disruption by the guide catheter in the proximal right coronary artery. The predilatation stenosis was 88 +/- 12%; the postdilatation stenosis was 28 +/- 9%. The use of the diagnostic catheter as a second catheter prevented damping and permitted the stable disengagement of the guiding catheter from the coronary artery. This technique is most useful in patients who have proximal right coronary artery stenoses because it provides optimal visualization of the segment undergoing dilatation, avoids the potential for ischemia in more distal stenoses, and thereby allows the procedure to be performed in a controlled, unhurried manner.\r"

Indications and results of 26 consecutive patients treated with a Tandem balloon catheter are reviewed. Adequate distal pressure measurements were obtained in 71% of the cases. In ten patients, the Tandem balloon catheter was selected for two stenoses in different segments of the same coronary artery. Angioplasty was successful for all lesions in five and for at least the strategic lesions in five patients (in one only after changing to a single-balloon catheter). In the seven patients with stenoses in two different coronary arteries of various calibers, angioplasty was successful for both vessels in three and for one vessel in four patients. In the six patients with a very tight stenosis, where the Tandem balloon catheter was selected to predilate with the small balloon, the procedure was technically successful in all, but there was a myocardial infarction in one patient. In the three patients with a chronic total occlusion, where the stiffness of the Tandem balloon was the reason for selection, one recanalization was successful. The Tandem balloon catheter provides a handy tool for complex coronary angioplasty. It offers comparable ease in manipulation and pressure transmission and may save time, money, and radiation exposure by avoiding catheter exchanges.\r"

Complications of the procedure included emergency bypass surgery (2.8%), myocardial infarction (3.0%), and hospital death (0.4%) inclusive. At least one of these complications (major cardiac event) occurred in 3.8% of patients. Prior to angioplasty, 46% of patients were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class II, 42% in Class III, and 12% in Class IV. Follow-up clinical evaluation (mean follow-up period of 16.9 months) showed 83% of patients in Class I, 14% in Class II, and 3% in Class III. Of the 286 successful patients who have reached 6 month follow-up plateau (mean follow-up period of 20.5 months), 164 (57%) have so far had repeat coronary angiography and exhibited three different patterns: all lesions patent (N = 54), some lesions restenosed (N = 60), and all lesions restenosed (N = 32). There were 18 patients with new vessel lesions (not previously dilated). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that clinical factors including diabetes (P less than .05), hypercholesterolemia, (P less than .01), new onset angina (P less than .05), current smoking (P less than .01), and morphologic and technical factors such as preangioplasty diameter stenosis greater than 95% (P less than .05) and higher balloon inflation pressure (P less than .05) were predictive of increased risk of recurrence. Patients were classified into two groups based on the anatomy of the target lesions. In Group A (N = 217), patients had a single lesion in each of the vessels to be dilated; Group B (N = 277) patients had a complex lesion in at least one of the vessels dilated. Group B patients were more likely to develop recurrence (P less than .05). Of the original 494 patients, 488 (99%) are alive. Coronary angioplasty (either initially or with repeat PTCA) has been the definitive treatment in 453 of the 494 patients for an overall success of 92%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A protocol to estimate the appropriate protamine dose was developed based on experience accumulated in the first 78 patients and tested subsequently in 101 consecutive patients. Clotting studies returned to the normal range in 92% of the patients. The mean APTT decreased from 84.1 +/- 19.4 to 27.4 +/- 2.5 sec (p less than .001) after protamine.

Changes in arterial permeability were analyzed by quantitating Evans blue dye (EBD) uptake over the aortic luminal surface (blue areas). Structural changes were assessed by light and electron microscopy. In the catheterized animals, compared to uncatheterized controls, we observed a significant increase in aortic luminal EBD uptake that was maximal 4 hours after the procedure but still present up to 13 weeks later. Microscopic analysis of \"blue areas\" shortly after the procedure revealed widespread endothelial denudation, platelet and leukocyte adherence, with occasional intimal avulsions, disruption of the internal elastica, and thrombi. The EBD uptake patterns in association with the electron microscopic findings in these animals suggested that 67-89% of the aortic endothelium was removed by the catheter during the procedure. The proliferative response that occurred following this catheter-induced injury produced fibrocellular intimal thickening in the aortas and left main coronary arteries of animals studied 10 to 92 days after the procedure. In the aortic root, such thickening was associated with incomplete re-endothelialization, thrombogenicity, and grossly abnormal permeability patterns. We conclude that significant catheter-induced intimal injury can occur during coronary angiography. In the canine model, such injury is associated with widespread fibrocellular intimal thickening and abnormal permeability that persists for at least 13 weeks after the procedure.\r"

This information was specifically sought in a spontaneous cardiomyopathic model. Metabolic and hemodynamic parameters were obtained in glucose-perfused beating hearts of 180-200-day-old cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters and age-matched healthy animals. This period in the cardiomyopathic hamster lifetime is intermediary between the necrotic phase and the appearance of heart failure. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to analyze energy metabolites and intracellular pH. Cardiomyopathic hamsters had significantly higher mole fraction values for inorganic phosphate, lower phosphocreatine mole fraction as well as lower phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate and adenosine triphosphate/inorganic phosphate ratios. Analysis of pH indicated the presence of regions of increased acidity within the heart of myopathic hamsters. Cardiomyopathic hamsters also had significantly lower left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption. Separate groups of normal and myopathic hamsters were given verapamil for 24 hours (one injection of 4 mg/kg s.c. followed by 1.2 g/l in drinking water). Verapamil-treated myopathic hamsters had evidence of markedly improved mitochondrial function when compared with untreated animals. Left ventricular pressure and coronary flow rose to normal levels. Replacing glucose by pyruvate in the perfusate of myopathic hamsters results in a marked increase in left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, and oxygen consumption with a moderate rise in phosphocreatine. Thus, 180-200-day-old cardiomyopathic hamster heart is characterized by evidence of decreased mitochondrial function, by areas of increased acidity within the heart, and by reduced left ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used transmission electron microscopy to study wall morphology in both dilated and constricted microvessels to understand the cellular basis of these changes. The relation between the orientation and density of myofilaments and the distribution of dense bodies was analyzed with respect to the level of microvessel tone. The data show a strong correlation between the degree of arteriolar constriction and both the orientation and density of myofilaments. In dilated arterioles, myofilament orientation was predominantly circumferential across the entire smooth muscle cell, averaging 84 +/- 2 degrees (SEM) relative to a radial reference line. In vessels constricted to 50% of their maximal diameter, myofilament orientation was dependent upon the location within the cell, being largely circumferential at the adventitial border (77 +/- 4 degrees) and shifting to a radial arrangement at the intimal border (36 +/- 5 degrees). The reorganization of myofilaments during constriction was associated with a decrease in myofilament density at the intimal-medial border of the smooth muscle cells. The decrease in myofilament density resulted from a selective withdrawal of myofilaments from periluminal areas where \"ridges\" had formed. Our observations suggest that an ordered distribution of membrane-associated dense bodies along the periluminal aspect of the smooth muscle cells is responsible for both the myofilament reorganization and ridge formation during vasoconstriction. Results of the present study are incorporated into a hypothetical model of arteriolar ultrastructure compatible with the mural reorganization observed during vasoconstriction.\r"

The DNA of this human genomic clone (lambda HCMHC8) hybridized much more strongly than did other clones isolated under similar, low stringency conditions both to the rabbit cDNA probe and to mRNA isolated from rat cardiac, but not skeletal, muscle tissue. Probe made from a DNA restriction fragment of lambda HCMHC8 hybridized a single 31S band of human ventricular mRNA. This size is identical to that of cardiac MHC mRNA of other species. Heteroduplex analysis showed hybridization of lambda HCMHC8 with exon segments in a rabbit cardiac MHC genomic clone (lambda MHC alpha 12/1). It also showed that lambda HCMHC8 spanned 14 kb of DNA and contained exon segments estimated to code for two-thirds of a MHC including the carboxylic acid terminus. By rescreening the library under more stringent conditions, where only DNA sequences having strong homology to cardiac MHC genes would be expected to hybridize, clones having restriction maps overlapping lambda HCMHC8 were isolated together with a unique clone (lambda HCMHC9). DNA gel blot hybridization of human genomic DNA with lambda HCMHC8 probe at medium stringency gave a pattern of restriction fragments similar to the restriction map of lambda HCMHC8. A weaker set of bands also appeared which corresponded in pattern to the map of lambda HCMHC9.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the chronotropic effects, spontaneously contracting monolayers of cultured rat myocardial cells were treated with histamine, 10(-7) M-10(-4) M. This resulted in a dose-dependent increase in contraction frequency reaching a maximum in 10(-5) M histamine. Contraction frequency (mean +/- SEM) increased from a control of 121 +/- 5 contractions per minute to 153 +/- 4.5, 181 +/- 9, 212 +/- 4, and 216 +/- 1 in 10(-7) M, 10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, and 10(-4) M histamine, respectively (for each n = 10, p less than 0.001). The effect was time-dependent, taking 30 minutes to develop fully. Changes in contraction frequency were accompanied by parallel dose- and time-dependent increases in the verapamil-sensitive sodium influx. Verapamil-sensitive sodium influx (pmol/cm2/sec) increased from a control of 10.45 +/- 1.44 (mean +/- SEM) to 24.34 +/- 2.41 and 32.57 +/- 2.35 at 10- and 30-minute treatment with 10(-6) M histamine (n = 5, p less than 0.001). These data fit the previously described relation between verapamil-sensitive sodium influx and contraction frequency in these cells. Cimetidine (10(-4) M) but not diphenhydramine (10(-4) M) abolished both the contraction frequency and sodium influx response to histamine. Subsequent studies showed a dose- and time-dependent elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with histamine treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The heart and lungs were placed in an artificial thorax with the great vessels and trachea exteriorized and attached to an artificial perfusion circuit and respirator, respectively. The blood volume of the system was adjusted to obtain various levels of static equilibrium pressure. Blood flow was obtained by cyclically raising and lowering the pressure in the artificial thorax, simulating the changes in pleural pressure that occur during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Lung inflation during the compression phase caused an increase in cardiopulmonary resuscitation blood flow when the change in pleural pressure was small and when static equilibrium pressure was high. In contrast, lung inflation caused a decrease in blood flow when changes in pleural pressure were high and when blood volume was low. These results suggest that the driving pressure for blood flow during chest compression may be increased by lung inflation when the pulmonary blood vessels are filled with blood. However, blood may become trapped in the right heart and unavailable for transfer to the periphery during chest compression if lung inflation causes the alveolar blood vessels to collapse.\r"

Cardiac norepinephrine concentration, norepinephrine turnover, and norepinephrine uptake were markedly increased in chronic diabetes in comparison with control values; these changes were reversible by 28-day insulin therapy. When the animals were exposed to cold for 6 hours, norepinephrine turnover rate constant increased in control and decreased in diabetic animals; cold exposure also increased norepinephrine concentration in diabetic hearts. Both cardiac norepinephrine concentration and turnover rate in diabetic rats were restored toward control values by ganglionic blockade with pentolinium. The conversion of [3H]tyrosine to [3H]catecholamine was enhanced and tyrosine hydroxylase as well as dopa decarboxylase activities were increased in diabetic hearts. The higher concentrations of [3H]normetanephrine and deaminated catechols indicated a faster metabolic rate of norepinephrine metabolism in hearts from diabetic rats; both monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase activities were also increased. The increased activities of the enzymes for the synthesis and metabolism of norepinephrine were not evident on treating the diabetic animals with insulin. These data not only support the view that chronic diabetes in rats is associated with increased sympathetic activity but also indicate that the cardiac norepinephrine concentration in diabetic rats may be maintained at a higher than normal level by an increased synthesis and uptake of norepinephrine in the adrenergic nerve terminals.\r"

Using a newly developed floating objective and high-speed cinematography, red cell velocities in small arterioles, capillaries, and small venules and microvascular diameters in the superficial layer of the epimyocardium of beating left ventricle were determined throughout the entire cardiac cycle in open-chest anesthetized dogs. Heart rate was maintained at 140 beats/min by means of left atrial pacing. Peak red cell velocity was observed in midsystole in small arterioles and capillaries, and in late systole in small venules. Abrupt decline in red cell velocity and, in many cases, a momentary cessation or reverse of flow, was observed in these microvessels during the pre-ejection period. The internal diameter of small venule was increased in late systole, while that of small arteriole remained almost constant during the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, in these epimyocardial microvessels, a higher percentage of the total area under the velocity curve occurred during the ejection phase; 51% in small arterioles, 43% in capillaries, and 40% in small venules. These findings indicate that the phasic blood flow pattern is markedly different in the subepimyocardial microvessels from that in the large epicardial artery and the septal artery. During vasodilation following dilazep (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.), an adenosine potentiator, red cell velocity increased throughout the entire cardiac cycle in epimyocardial microvessels with significant increases in the total area under the velocity curves accompanied by significant dilation of the arterioles. The present data will provide information useful in predicting or simulating transmural differences in the phasic blood flow pattern.\r"

Traditional tests for AMI were developed as diagnostic measures and cannot be expected to measure up to issues raised by modern therapy. Despite its pitfalls, echocardiography can be applied prognostically during the first few hours of AMI evolution to far more patients than can any other imaging technique. We believe that an adequate echocardiographic examination can be an important adjunct that should be used in the early risk assessment of any patient with AMI. Those patients with the greatest potential reversible myocardial damage are clearly the best candidates for aggressive interventions, particularly thrombolysis. For patients with small or no detectable regional wall motion abnormalities, a more conservative initial approach is in order.\r"

In the patients receiving taurine plasma epinephrine (E) decreased significantly, with a negligible decrease in plasma norepinephrine (NE). The effect of taurine on plasma catecholamines and the response of plasma E after the stimulation with glucagon was also studied in 12 borderline hypertensive and nine age-matched normotensive subjects. Basal plasma E was significantly higher in borderline hypertensive than in normal subjects, but basal plasma NE did not differ in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded from this study. The global hemodynamic pattern of the septic patients was characterized by a lower stroke volume, despite an elevated cardiac index. Coronary sinus blood flow was high (187 +/- 47 vs 130 +/- 21 ml/min in the control group, p less than .001) due to marked coronary vasodilation, especially in the subgroup of nonsurvivors. In contrast to the control group, myocardial lactate uptake was elevated, while that of free fatty acids, glucose, and ketone bodies was diminished in patients with septic shock. These findings were especially prominent in the nonsurvivors. Expressed as oxygen equivalents, the contribution of free fatty acids as an energy source of the myocardium was markedly diminished in septic patients (12% vs 54% in the control group, p less than .005), while that of lactate was increased (36% vs 12%, p less than .01). The observed shift in myocardial substrate extraction was associated with a discrepancy between measured myocardial oxygen consumption and that calculated chemically from commonly available exogenous substrates: 41% of myocardial oxygen consumption was not explained by the utilization of commonly available substrates extracted from coronary circulation in all patients with septic shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We report results of follow-up transesophageal electrophysiologic studies in 35 infants seven to 27 months old (mean, 12 months) in whom paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) using an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection had been previously evaluated by transesophageal study in the first 2 months (mean, 14 days) of life. No infants were receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy at the time of follow-up study. To evaluate AV conduction and initiate PAT, a standard transesophageal pacing protocol was used: single extrastimuli in sinus rhythm, incremental pacing to second-degree AV block, and burst pacing at cycle lengths near those resulting in second-degree AV block. If PAT was not initiated during the baseline period, the protocol was repeated during the infusion of isoproterenol and after administration of atropine. At follow-up study, PAT was reinitiated in 24 of 35 (68%) infants, six of whom had exhibited recent spontaneous recurrence of PAT. AV nodal function did not differ in those with and those without inducible PAT. However, when initial and follow-up studies were compared, changes in antegrade conduction of the accessory AV connection were observed, since only five of 10 infants with preexcitation at initial study continued to exhibit preexcitation at follow-up study (1/5 infants only after isoproterenol). Additionally, changes in retrograde conduction of the accessory AV connection were observed; the ventriculoatrial interval in PAT induced at follow-up study increased by 20 to 40 msec in eight of 24 infants and by 50 to 80 msec in five of 24 infants compared with the interval at initial study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During 25 baseline paced cycle lengths (SB-SB) of 400 to 800 msec in 14 patients, a shorter cycle length (S'-S') was introduced that was 10 to 20 msec (mean 15 +/- 5) greater in duration than the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) determined after 12 beats of the respective baseline cycle length (group 1 trials). In addition, during 14 of the 25 baseline cycle lengths, a second shorter cycle length was introduced that was 50 to 80 msec (mean 65 +/- 10) greater than the VERP of the respective baseline cycle length (group 2 trials). In all 39 group 1 and group 2 trials the VERP was determined after each of at least 3 beats (S'1, S'2, S'3) of the shorter cycle length and in six of the 25 group I trials the VERP was determined after each of at least 12 beats of the shorter cycle length.

  ".W": "With the increasing popularity of the Jatene procedure for the treatment of common or D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA), the preoperative definition of coronary artery anatomy in D-TGA has assumed great importance. Consequently, the reliability of two-dimensional echocardiography for determining the coronary artery anatomy was studied in 32 infants with D-TGA. Surgical observation of the coronary anatomy was used to assess the accuracy of the echocardiographic diagnosis. The coronary arteries were visualized in 29 of 32 patients (90%), predominantly with the use of parasternal and apical views. In the three remaining patients visualization of the coronary arteries was inadequate to allow determination of their anatomy. The coronary artery anatomy was correctly predicted in 25 of the 29 patients in whom the coronary arteries were visualized. The anatomic patterns included usual coronary anatomy for D-TGA (n = 16), left circumflex coronary from the right coronary artery (n = 6), single right coronary artery (n = 1), single left coronary artery (n = 1), and inverted origin of the coronary arteries (n = 1). The errors in the remaining four patients were (1) false-negative diagnosis of origin of the left circumflex coronary from the right coronary artery (n = 1); (2) false-positive diagnosis of origin of the left circumflex coronary from the right coronary artery (n = 1), and (3) diagnosis of origin of the left circumflex coronary from the right coronary artery when the correct diagnosis was single right coronary artery (n = 2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prenatal and postnatal echocardiographic findings agreed regarding the diagnostic criteria for critical aortic stenosis and primary forms of cardiomyopathy were excluded. Results of fetal Doppler examination were consistent with valvular aortic stenosis and excluded mitral regurgitation. Determination of the left ventricular size excluded ventricular hypoplasia. The infant was delivered by cesarean section and underwent successful emergency aortic valvotomy at 12 h of age. Fetal echocardiography, in combination with a multidisciplinary postnatal approach, can be used in the successful treatment of a severe form of congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether ergonovine acts directly on coronary arteries or via remote neurohumoral reflexes, we administered small titrated increments of intracoronary ergonovine up to a maximum cumulative dose of 50 micrograms to 15 patients. In six patients with variant angina (group 1), ischemic electrocardiographic ST changes, angina, and localized coronary spasm (local coronary diameter reduction of 87.8 +/- 18.9% [mean +/- SD]) followed after 6 to 50 micrograms (mean 20.7) cumulative intracoronary ergonovine. In nine patients with atypical chest pain, normal baseline coronary arteriograms, and no evidence of variant angina (group 2), there was no ischemic ST segment change or localized coronary spasm after 6 to 50 micrograms (mean 31.6) intracoronary ergonovine. Coronary diameter of proximal vessels of patients in group 2 was reduced by 16.2 +/- 6.5% and did not differ from the response of nonspastic vessels of comparable size of group 1 (20.5 +/- 13.8%; p = .7). There was no significant difference in the median effective dose values in the dose-response curves of the spastic and nonspastic segments between groups 1 and 2. Ergonovine causes coronary spasm by a direct local effect, which seems to be caused by localized arterial hyperreactivity rather than supersensitivity. Intracoronary delivery may be safer than intravenous administration because negligible drug recirculation may prevent perpetuation of spasm and selective coronary administration can avoid branches with critical stenoses.\r"

In each, we used the umbrella for closure because the defect was too short and/or too large to close with conventional transcatheter methods. The defects included three post-Glenn venous communications (superior vena cava-right atrium, n = 2; azygos vein to inferior vena cava), four congenital \"interatrial defects\" producing cyanosis (\"coronary sinus\" septal defect, left superior vena cava to left atrium, patent foramen ovale, left inferior vena cava to left atrium), and five non-PDA systemic-to-pulmonary arterial communications (two congenital and three postoperative). Ten of 12 defects were embolized successfully; nine had complete or subtotal closure, and one was partially closed. The first attempted closure resulted in embolization of a 12 mm device to a lower-lobe pulmonary artery, without clinical sequelae. No other complications occurred. Clinical improvement was most dramatic in those patients whose cyanosis was relieved and less obvious when pulmonary blood flow was reduced. The Rashkind umbrella device, originally designed for closure of PDA, considerably expands the list of congenital or operative defects that can be closed nonsurgically.\r"

A No. 8F or 9F catheter was chosen with balloon lengths of 30 or 40 mm and maximum inflation diameters 1 mm less than the smallest measured aortic diameter determined 1 cm proximal to the coarctation site. A 10 sec inflation-deflation cycle of 6 to 8 atmospheres (90 to 120 psi) was performed. The peak systolic pressure gradient (PSG) before BCA ranged from 35 to 70 mm Hg (mean 58), and immediately after BCA it decreased to 0 to 20 mm Hg (mean 7). One to two year follow-up (mean 14 months) of the seven patients revealed a PSG range of 10 to 30 mm Hg (mean 19). Repeat angiography was performed immediately proximal to the coarctation site. Three patients (43%) had evidence of aneurysm formation at or immediately distal to the balloon dilatation site. One patient had coarctation restenosis. While initial results with BCA for unoperated coarctation were encouraging, current data raise serious concerns about its long-term safety and efficacy.\r"

These patients were evaluated clinically 7 to 16 years (mean 8.9 years) after surgery by review of clinical records, questionnaire, or direct examination. There were five deaths: one during arrhythmia, the second sudden and unexplained, and three others after reoperation. Four of the five patients had evidence of obstruction of the atriopulmonary or atrioventricular conduit. There were eight reoperations. Two were for residual atrial septal defects, one for an atrial septal defect and an intrapulmonary arteriovenous fistula, and one for a residual ventricular septal defect. The other four were reoperated for severe conduit or homograft obstruction. One of these four also had a residual shunt, severe mitral regurgitation, and reduced left ventricular function. One patient was found to have left ventricular dysfunction 3 months after surgery, which persisted. Another patient had left ventricular dysfunction unmasked after successful mitral annuloplasty for severe mitral regurgitation. No other patients had clinical evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Recurrent supraventricular tachycardia occurred in four patients and was eventually fatal in one patient with associated conduit obstruction. Of the 27 survivors, 13 are in NYHA class I, 13 are in class II, and one is in class III. We conclude that clinical results of the Fontan operation remain good in most patients 7 to 16 years after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The area of vessel wall-atheroma interface, fraction of lumen occluded, and other indexes of atherogenesis were measured in each of 26 segments of aorta excised from the animals, half of which were administered injections (intravenous) of Separan three times a week. Regression analysis of the morphometric data indicates that the polyelectrolyte exerts a powerful antiatherogenic effect in all regions of the aorta, inhibiting the formation of plaque mass to less than half in the aortic arch and about one-fifth in the descending aorta as compared with the aortic plaque masses in untreated rabbits. Results are compatible with the suggestion that a novel hemodynamic principle in vivo, polymer drag reduction, might be effectively applied against atherosclerosis.\r"

Marked platelet accumulation (39.5 +/- 8.7 X 10(6) platelets/1 cm vessel length) was observed at 30 min and remained active until 4 hr after angioplasty. Total accumulation over 24 hr was 56.4 +/- 4.7 X 10(6) platelets/1 cm length. Histologic dissection was directly related to the degree of platelet accumulation, with 64 +/- 15 X 10(6) platelets/1 cm in the group with marked dissection and 8.7 +/- 3.7 X 10(6) platelets/1 cm in the group with minimal dissection (p less than .05). Increasing angiographic dissection also resulted in a trend toward increased platelet accumulation, and angiographic change in luminal diameter showed a significant correlation with platelet accumulation. It is concluded that marked platelet accumulation occurs early after transluminal angioplasty and is related to the extent of dissection. Restenosis may result from a complex interaction of platelet accumulation, vascular damage, and blood flow.\r"

We measured changes in arterial pressure, reflex vascular responses in skeletal muscle and paw, and changes in renal nerve traffic that occurred after the left atrial or left ventricular injection of 5-HT. Injection of 5-HT (100 to 600 micrograms) into left atrium or ventricle produced large reflex increases in vascular resistance and sympathetic outflow. These responses were not reduced after bilateral cervical vagotomy. In separate experiments, increases in renal nerve traffic with left ventricular injection of 5-HT were assessed before and after cardiac sympathetic deafferentation. Interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways did not significantly attenuate increases in renal nerve activity with 5-HT. Injection of 5-HT (300 micrograms) into the aortic root produced large increases in arterial pressure but this was not observed after injections into the vertebral or common carotid arteries or descending aorta. Injection of 5-HT (100 micrograms) into the left main coronary artery (perfused via a Gregg cannula from an external reservoir) resulted in a depressor reflex (Bezold-Jarisch). In contrast, injection of 5-HT (200 micrograms) into the left ventricle when the drug was prevented from reaching the left coronary artery produced a large pressor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The preparations were studied 2 to 4 months after ligation of multiple distal tributaries of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. Subendocardial Purkinje fibers from corresponding areas of normal hearts served as control samples (control preparation). Transmembrane action potential characteristics and rates of automaticity (spontaneous phase 4 depolarization) did not differ among control, noninfarct, and infarct preparations. However, overdrive at cycle lengths of less than 400 msec suppressed automaticity to a greater degree in Purkinje fibers of infarct preparations than those of control and noninfarct preparations. Changes in automatic rate during superfusion with isoproterenol (10(-10)M to 10(-6)M) were not different among the three groups of preparations, but exposure to phenylephrine (10(-9)M to 10(-5)M) in the presence of 5 X 10(-7)M propranolol reduced the automatic rate to a greater degree in Purkinje fibers of infarct preparations than those of control or noninfarct preparations. Triggered activity arising from delayed afterdepolarizations was recorded in 10 of 29 infarct preparations (34%), but not in 12 control and 10 noninfarct preparations. These afterpotentials were augmented by increasing extracellular Ca++ concentration, 10(-7)M isoproterenol, and 10(-5)M phenylephrine in the presence of 5 X 10(-7)M propranolol. We conclude that Purkinje fibers overlying healed infarct scars have altered physiology of spontaneous automaticity, enhanced responses to alpha-adrenergic interventions, and a tendency to triggered activity, and that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects may result in worsening of arrhythmias by augmentation of afterpotentials in healed myocardial infarction.\r"

Regional myocardial function (sonomicrometers, wall thickness) and blood flow (microspheres) were measured during a control treadmill exercise bout and an identical run 3 hr later after the administration of UL-FS 49 (1.0 mg/kg iv). In the control run, heart rate increased from 114 +/- 20 to 230 +/- 19 beats/min and systolic wall thickening (%WT) in the poststenotic myocardium decreased from 23.3 +/- 5.2% at rest to 9.3 +/- 5.0%, a 60% reduction. Subendocardial blood flow in the ischemic area decreased from 1.04 +/- 0.30 to 0.55 +/- 0.40 ml/min/g, blood flow per beat decreased from 9.1 X 10(-3) to 2.5 X 10(-3) ml/g, and mean transmural flow failed to increase (1.06 +/- 0.30 vs 1.08 +/- 0.39 ml/min/g).

The slopes of the coronary pressure-flow relationships were approximated by a linear regression analysis in which the correlation coefficients were greater than .98 in all cases.

They have been examined by conventional radiographic techniques and computerized tomography, and more recently 4 patients have been scanned by magnetic resonance. CT studies of patients with small tumours have shown that the point of origin is at the sphenopalatine foramen. The tumour enlarges the foramen and erodes bone locally giving rise to characteristic signs both on plain X-ray and on CT scan. The value of magnetic resonance imaging is assessed and it is concluded that in the presence of the characteristic 'antral sign' on plain X-ray, 3-plane magnetic resonance is now the method of choice to show the extent of the tumour pre-operatively. Magnetic resonance can also show the vascular nature of the angiofibroma by the demonstration of large vessels, shown as dark areas of negative signal within the tumour mass. With this new method of investigation available, angiography should now only be performed if embolization is deemed necessary prior to surgical removal of the angiofibroma.\r"

One hundred and thirty-three patients with Bell's palsy were evaluated, and the patients could be divided into 3 groups. Group 1 was composed of subjects in whom the stapedial reflex was present in the first week of paralysis and complete recovery of facial function occurred in 30-60 days. In group 2 the stapedial reflex reappeared between the eighth and thirty-fifth days post-onset and facial function recovered within 150 days. In group 3, the stapedial reflex reappeared between the thirty-sixth and seventieth day and some paralysis was still present after 1 year. These results suggest that the reflex is important for prognostic purposes.\r"

One child with a high tone hearing loss and 4 children with no detectable hearing loss on audiometry showed significant differences in the interaural interpeak latencies of selected brain stem auditory evoked potentials. In 2 children these abnormalities had resolved on subsequent testing, 2 had evidence of persistent retrocochlear dysfunction and the remaining child died prior to further evaluation. Routine measurement of brain stem auditory evoked potentials is probably not necessary for the majority of children undergoing treatment for cancer, although such measurements are of value when differentiation between cochlear and retrocochlear damage is required.\r"

The influence of position and tension of a malleus to footplate prosthesis (columella) was studied in the same way. It is concluded that an incus prosthesis should be placed along an imaginary line through the centre of the footplate and the head of the stapes. With a malleus to footplate prosthesis the position on the footplate is relatively unimportant. Tension between the malleus, prosthesis and footplate, however, is quite important and should be as low as possible, and compatible with a stable situation. The malleus to footplate prosthesis provides a columella type of prosthesis which for lower frequencies works better than an incus prosthesis, and occasionally even better than the normal ear.\r"

Four hundred and three children were seen during the study period and of these 13 (3%) reported tinnitus spontaneously. All these children had evidence of ear disease at the time of the consultation. The incidence of tinnitus in those members of this group with abnormal ears was significantly higher than in those children with no evidence of ear disease (P = less than 0.02).

During the last decade, vaporization of the papillomas with the carbon dioxide laser has been the most frequently applied method of treatment, but recurrences are often observed. Alpha-interferon seems to affect the clinical course of juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis in children. We therefore started treating 3 patients with persistent adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis with alpha-interferon in combination with regular endoscopic removal using the CO2 laser. In 1 case a complete remission occurred within 3 months. Administration of alpha-interferon was continued for another 6 months. Laryngoscopy in the 2 other patients showed only minor lesions after treatment with alpha-interferon for 1 1/2 years. Alpha-interferon treatment is still being continued. The dramatic improvement in the laryngeal picture of these patients during the treatment with alpha-interferon leads to the conclusion that alpha-interferon can affect the course of this disease. Whether a definite cure can be achieved is, however, still questionable.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and fifteen patients with chronic nasal symptoms underwent both radiological and antroscopic investigation of their maxillary sinuses. A total of 193 antra were studied. The radiological diagnosis completely correlated with the antroscopic findings in only 44% of the cases. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed as well as the additional limitations of radiology in the diagnosis of the opaque antrum and the accurate detection of sinus fluid. Antroscopy provides accurate information about the nature of mucosal changes, the presence of secretions and the state of the natural ostium. This technique therefore ensures a precise diagnosis on which appropriate primary treatment can be based as well as offering the most reliable means of selecting patients who require surgery. The potential for detecting early antral tumours is stressed. It is concluded that antroscopy is the most useful investigation in the management of chronic conditions of the maxillary sinus. However, radiology still has its place as a primary screening test, particularly when the radiographic findings are negative.\r"

Twenty patients with a metastatic lesion in the neck, in whom the primary tumour was not found despite extensive, diagnostic procedures, were treated in the Department of Otolaryngology, Linkoping University Hospital, during a 14-year period (1971-1984). Since 1975 tonsillectomy has been performed regularly on the affected side as a part of the diagnostic procedure. Eight patients without any clinical signs of a tonsillar primary have been diagnosed to have carcinoma by tonsillectomy and careful examination of the serially sectioned tonsillectomy specimen. The diagnosis of the metastatic nodes was based on histopathological examination in 8 patients and on fine needle aspiration cytology in 12. Four of 9 patients with squamous cell carcinoma survived 3 years and so did 4 of 5 with anaplastic carcinoma. All 5 patients treated surgically are alive and 6 of 12 who were irradiated. Ten of 12 patients with mobile unilateral nodes (N1) were alive at follow-up after 1-13 years but only 3 of 8 patients with fixed nodes (N3) at follow-up of 1-3 years.\r"

All patients but one were male and had no knowledge of their renal disease and sought medical advice for symptoms due to hypertension. Five patients had no history of gross hematuria. Histological vascular findings showed, in three proliferative endarteritis and fibrinoid necrosis, in five arteriolosclerosis and in two vascular hypertrophy. In spite of good blood pressure control, six patients reached terminal uremia within a maximum of 14 months. In summary, the incidence of malignant hypertension in adults with IgA nephropathy is higher than previously reported, and its true incidence can only be known if more histopathologic studies of patients with malignant hypertension are performed. Patients with this association reach end stage renal failure in a short period of time.\r"

  ".W": "Serum creatinine levels were determined prospectively every 2 to 3 months in 40 patients with diabetic nephropathy for a global observation period of 864 months. The monthly creatinine increasing rate was significantly lower in normotensive periods, mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 115 mmHg, when compared with hypertensive periods, MAP greater than 125 mmHg. No significant difference was shown in periods with borderline hypertension (MAP between 115-124 mmHg). The mean creatinine increases were of 0.036 mg/dl/month, 0.3 mg/dl/month and 0.046 mg/dl/month respectively. Normotension was associated with a slowing down of the rate of decline in renal function in this group of moderate kidney failure with an initial mean serum creatinine of 2.26 mg/dl. The exposure of patients to nephrotoxics (aminoglycosides, and possibly anesthesia) significantly accelerated the decline in renal function: 0.39 mg/dl/month and 0.17 mg/dl/month respectively according to the concomitance or not of toxics and hypertension. The reported protective effect of diabetes against aminoglycosides nephrotoxicity in experimental conditions was not reflected in our clinical results. On the contrary, we suggest a possible enhanced sensibility of the diabetic patient with diabetic nephropathy to aminoglycosides leading to an acceleration of the progression of renal failure.\r"

Plasma volume (PV) was 139% of the normal control before and significantly reduced to 125% N after UF (p less than 0.05). Average reduction of PV was 0.3 l, while that of body weight was 4.4 kg. This means that UF induces mainly the reduction of extracellular fluid volume with very little effect on blood volume due to high intravascular refilling. Hemodynamically, cardiac index decreased and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) remained unchanged according to the decrease of mean blood pressure (MBP). Change in MBP was linearly correlated to that in TPRI. The present study indicates that UF leads to interstitial fluid volume depletion and blood pressure reduction in diabetic nephrotics with severe renal insufficiency. Clinically, UF is a temporary relief from a life-threatening generalized edema in these patients, although neither the progress of renal dysfunction or the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome can be prevented.\r"

Fibrin formation, followed by visual inspection and the measuring of fibrinopeptide A and fibrin monomer concentrations were equally suppressed by the two regimens.

Patients with a disc herniation rarely had pain in the upper trunk or arms (three of 37) compared with the normal group (23 of 44). Only one of nine patients with pain in the groin had disc herniation, and the same was true concerning pain in the iliac crest. Three patients without pain below the knee had no prolapsed disc.

Other ski clinics report a similar incidence of ACL injuries. In view of the 570 registered ski slopes in the United States, the ACL injuries occur at epidemic proportions. Under consideration are causal factors involved in the typical skier's ACL injury, such as recent evolutions in skiing techniques, boot styles, the skier's environment, and the anatomic considerations relating to body mechanics that place the ACL in a position of compromise in the intercondylar notch. Clear identification of the mechanism of ski injury of the ACL is difficult. As the significant causative factors become identified, and with the stimulation of further interest and research, there is some promise for prevention in the future.\r"

There was no statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of thin radiolucent lines in any location and the eventual postoperative clinical result. In 7%, thick lines (greater than 2 mm) were noted about the central peg of the prosthesis as well as under both plateaus and were associated with poor results. A 1-mm radiolucent interface was attached to various tibial components, which were then cemented into cadaver knees. For the polyethylene total condylar component, flexion or rotation of the prosthesis more than 5 degrees, angulation of the roentgen beam more than 6 degrees, or offsetting the beam more than 2.5 cm prevented visualization of the radiolucent line. With metal-backed components, more than 4 degrees of flexion obscured the lines. Therefore, extremely careful positioning of postoperative radiographs is essential for evaluating radiolucent lines after total knee arthroplasty.\r"

Only six cases of M. fortuitum prosthetic joint infection have been previously described. Persistent drainage characterized cases in which the prosthesis was left in place. Although antibiotic treatment temporarily suppressed the signs and symptoms of infection, cure required removal of the prosthesis, as in the present case. Diagnosis of M. fortuitum infection is difficult because acid-fast stains of the organisms are often negative. Routinely bacterial cultures are continued for less than about five days, a period not long enough for growth of M. fortuitum. M. fortuitum infections should be considered in draining prosthetic joints with negative bacterial cultures and in those that have had repeated glucocorticoid intraarticular injections.\r"

  ".W": "Of the 734 adult tibial fractures treated in Aspen, Colorado, from 1968-1978, follow-up results were obtained on 527 (72%). The fractures were analyzed with regard to rate of healing, age of patient, and location of fractures. There was a statistically significant increase in healing time with increasing age between ages 16-40. The location of tibial fracture (proximal, middle, distal) had no significant influence on rate of healing. The occurrence of open tibial fracture was low (3% of total) and in most instances wounds were benign (Class I). Compartment syndrome is rarely encountered in skiing fracture because of the relatively low energy involved. All tibial fractures occurring between 1982-1984 were reviewed and compared to the earlier series. This comparison confirmed the continual overall decline in rate of tibial fracture from skiing (from 12.9/100,000 skier days in 1968 to 2.9/100,000 skier days in 1983). This decline was primarily in spiral fractures (from 70% of total in 1968 to 50% in 1983). The percent of transverse fractures was unchanged (+/- 15%) while the percent of short oblique fractures increased from 11% to 33%. Properly adjusted and maintained safety equipment afforded reasonable protection from spiral fractures of the tibia, but a conceptual departure from the current release binding design would be required to protect against the benign moments that produced transverse and short oblique fracture. The current treatment philosophy is based on fracture type and the availability or experience with newer treatment modes.\r"

  ".W": "Supernumerary muscle bellies (SMBs) of the forearm, common anatomic variant, are usually asymptomatic but can produce a debilitating pain syndrome that is secondary to a tendon-muscle shear phenomenon. This shear phenomenon seems to occur when a SMB is attached to another muscle and the excursion of the two units are different, thus parts of a muscle unit are prevented from migrating proximally on contraction of the entire muscle. The anomalous muscle may have either greater excursion, as in an anomalous palmaris longus attached to the flexor digitorum superficialis, or less excursion, as in an anomalous superficialis muscle attached to the carpus. The shear at the interface between different muscle-tendon units produces a burning pain that usually is localized to the distal one-third of the forearm. Surgical excision of the abnormal restricting muscle or tendon component relieves the symptom complex and restores the ability to apply full power. Observation on typical cases, diagnostic methods, operative technique, and results of the syndrome suggest that SSMB may be responsible for undiagnosed and untreated instances of distal forearm complaints.\r"

Sarcomatous changes around aluminum oxide ceramics seem not to have been reported in the literature. The present report may be the first documented case of an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma detected 15 months after the patient had an uncemented ceramic total hip arthroplasty. If a causal relationship exists, the incidence of this phenomenon in the United States is 250 times greater than would be expected from statistics on soft tissue sarcoma at the hip. Because of the similarity on plane roentgenograms of this tumor to lesions known to be caused by wear debris, tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of cases of total hip loosening.\r"

Previous researchers have hypothesized that OA follows stiffening of subchondral bone through trabecular microfractures. Although it is widely recognized that marked changes in the subchondral bone are a consistent feature of advanced OA, the nature of the changes in the bone in OA has not received significant attention. The heads of the femur from 67 patients who had joint replacement for advanced OA and 66 autopsy controls without discernible joint disease were examined microscopically to ascertain the number and distribution of trabecular microfractures in coronal slabs and to quantify the mineralization and thickness of trabecular bone in a principal compressive zone. There was a reduction in the number of trabecular microfractures in OA patients, compared with the controls, with a lack of correlation between numbers of microfractures and age in OA patients. There was no evidence for the hypothesis that increased numbers of microfractures led to the increase of bone to support the view that microfractures play a role in maintaining OA joint structure. Structural changes produced relatively sclerotic and porotic groups of OA and two subgroups of the sclerotic group.\r"

At six weeks in the in vivo system, the TCP stabilized specimens had an increased average resistance to tensile testing, but the increase was not significant. At six months, however, TCP-stabilized specimens exhibited a significant increase in resistance to pull-out force (p less than 0.05). Histologic examination revealed incorporation of the TCP granules in bone bridging from the endosteal cortex to the porous surfaces. TCP granules might be useful as a synthetic interposition material for stabilization of porous-coated metal components. TCP granules exhibited osteoconductive properties.\r"

All of the shoulder dislocations were anterior, most were primary (81%) and men (83%) were involved more frequently. Twenty-four percent of the dislocations were thought to be equipment related. At follow-up examination three to four years after injury, a significant number (41%) were still symptomatic either from a recurrence (18%) or pain and weakness (23%). Patients with rotator cuff tears tended to be about ten years older than the average skier. Their injuries were usually a result of a fall on ipsilateral arm and were not equipment related. Of the 13 patients responding after a three-year follow-up period, most (10/13) were asymptomatic. There were 24 AC separations. All resulted from a direct fall on the shoulder. Sixty percent were first degree, 22% were second degree, and 18% were third degree. About one-third of the respondents with first and second degree injuries were still having significant pain at three-year follow-up examination. The most frequent isolated fracture was a minimally displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity (only three cases in 135 injuries), but this same fracture occurred in 10% of the shoulder dislocations.\r"

Suppression of this osteoclastic component of the increased bone turnover, especially if it is widespread, was the rationale for treatment with calcitonin (CT).

During the fracture healing in control animals, the pH of the fracture site changed from 7.2 on Day 2 to 7.5 on Day 20 following fracture, i.e., alkaline with respect to the pH of normal extracellular fluid. Deposition of radioopaque callus occurred mainly during the alkaline phase. In the steroid-treated rats the rate and extent of pH change were significantly less and the fracture site became alkaline five to ten days later than in the control animals. Because radiopaque callus deposition still occurred predominantly in the alkaline phase, union was also delayed by about the same interval of time. The rat prednisolone model differs significantly from the human condition of delayed union. Clinical investigations are indicated to ascertain whether abnormalities of fracture site pH occur in delayed union in humans.\r"

In order to evaluate the predictive power of bone mineral measurements at various sites, bone mineral content (BMC) has been measured at four skeletal sites and compared to subsequent fracture incidence at all skeletal locations, including spine and appendicular sites. Os calcis BMC has the most consistent monotonic relationship to unadjusted fracture incidence rates; os calcis BMC also has the strongest (p = 0.009) relation to levels of relative risk, after adjustment for age, height, and weight. Based on actual ability to predict fracture risk prospectively, along with such secondary criteria as cost, ease of performance, precision, and radiation exposure, the os calcis appears to be an optimal BMC measurement site for routine screening of perimenopausal women.\r"

Stiffness was described as none or mild in 66 (96%), moderate in two (3%), and severe in one (1%). Pain was described as none or mild in 68 (99%) and moderate in one (1%). Sixty-two patients (90%) preferred outpatient surgery with regional anesthesia whereas only seven (10%) did not. Forty-five (65%) of the 69 patients who required surgery had used traditional poles with straps, suggesting the pole as the causative factor. However, only 20% of noninjured skiers during the 1981-1982 season were using traditional poles with straps, and the total number of complete ulnar collateral ligament repairs did not decrease with the same number of skiers. Therefore, the change in pole design has not decreased the incidence of total ulnar collateral ligament tears. The results of acute surgical repair as an outpatient with regional anesthesia are excellent; 96% of the patients were pleased with the results. If the lesion is overlooked, the results of secondary construction are not nearly as good.\r"

However, appropriate prevention and prompt recognition will minimize the impact of these disorders. Prevention is predicated upon slow ascent to altitude and minimizing initial exertion at altitude; in selected cases, preventive drug therapy with Diamox (Lederle, Pearl River, New York) is helpful. Early recognition and descent to lower altitude remain the cornerstones of therapy.\r"

Physicians who treat winter sports trauma must be prepared to manage the spectrum of these injuries including hypothermia, frostbite, and the combination of both. Hypothermia is primarily a problem of mortality, which can be lowered by gentle handling, close cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and appropriate rewarming. Frostbite, a problem of morbidity from local tissue loss, can be treated most effectively with rapid rewarming in a water bath of 40 degrees-42 degrees. Spontaneous thawing with further injury to insensitive frostbitten members and refreezing injuries give a poor prognosis. The management of hypothermia and frostbite is directed first to hypothermia to lessen mortality and second to frostbite to decrease the morbidity.\r"

The cause of Achilles tendinitis and Achilles tendon rupture is, in fact, pressure within the fascial compartment of the Achilles tendon, which is caused by a swollen distal soleus muscle, occluding the circulation, and thereby producing avascular necrosis with subsequent tendinitis yielding to rupture. Four types of peroneal tendon dislocations and related problems are presented.\r"

The operative methods compared coracoclavicular (CC) with AC fixation methods. Excision of the distal clavicle was performed for chronic dislocations. AC fixation methods included Kirschner wires alone, Kirschner-wire fixation with coracoacromial ligament transfer, and Kirschner-wire fixation with tension wiring. Results were graded using evaluation of pain, range of motion, and residual deformity. AC fixation methods proved to be more successful than CC fixation methods. Excellent results were obtained in more than 89% of both AC and CC methods. AC methods had more minor complications including infections and implant breakage, but no failure or recurrences of the dislocation. CC methods resulted in 9% failure or recurrences. Of the AC fixation methods, the Kirschner wire with tension wiring gave the best results but required a more extensive operation for removal of implants. Excision of the distal end of the clavicle is an adequate form of treatment for the chronic complete painful AC dislocation.\r"

There were no redislocations and all patients were improved over their preoperative status. Five patients achieved a good result and two had a fair result based on a 100-unit rating system. One transient axillary nerve palsy occurred, but there were no other complications.

Thirteen adult patients were treated by open reduction and application of medial and lateral buttress plates providing rigid internal fixation and early motion. The patients were evaluated for range of motion, infection, nerve injury, avascular necrosis, myositis ossificans, varus/valgus deformity, pain, instability, weakness, and degenerative changes. Ten of the 13 patients were available for follow-up study for an average of two years. Nine of the ten achieved good or excellent results. Based on these observations, the treatment of choice is internal fixation with dual plates combined with early active postoperative motion.\r"

To determine the extent of this practice in Virginia, the head nurses of all 68 newborn nurseries and a random sample of 200 pediatricians were surveyed. Formula samples were being distributed at all hospitals. Formula packs were given to breast-feeding mothers at 65 (95%) hospitals although only 66 percent of the surveyed pediatricians approved of this practice. Samples of baby items other than formula (e.g., baby powder) were being distributed at 66 (97%) hospitals. Some physicians (18%) objected to the distribution of these nonformula samples, and others were not familiar with the content of these packs. In most instances, the hospital medical staff had not voted to approve the distribution of these packs. Parents were being informed only rarely about the source and intent of the packs. The provision of sample packs to newly delivered parents affects approximately 3,000,000 babies each year in the United States. The short- and long-term effects of providing these packs have been inadequately explored. Physicians should make an active decision whether to distribute sample packs. Those physicians choosing to dispense these samples may wish to review and edit the content of the packs and to enclose in the pack a brief note explaining that the provision of the products does not constitute a medical endorsement.\r"

A serum carbamazepine concentration had increased from 11.9 mg/L (measured 1 week prior to antibiotic use) to 25.8 mg/L. Following erythromycin withdrawal, serum concentrations returned toward baseline, and symptoms resolved. Erythromycin has known effects on hepatic enzyme function, with altered cytochrome P-450 function. The dramatic reduction in carbamazepine clearance observed in this patient is similar to that reported when erythromycin is used concurrently with other drugs.

Hyponatremia (serum sodium 135 mEq/L) was observed in 27 (32%), but neither the initial laboratory data nor the subsequent follow-up data supported the diagnosis of SIADH. Moderate to severe dehydration was documented in 16 patients (19%) and suspected in more than 50% of the cases (serial weight determinations indicating an increase in weight from admission to discharge). Although the incidence of neurologic sequelae in this series was not influenced significantly by the presence or absence of hyponatremia, SIADH, or fluid restriction, the numbers are still small. Based on these data, routine fluid restriction cannot be recommended unless there is confirmatory evidence of SIADH.\r"

An attempt is made in this study to identify those markers that are predictive of a tendency to relapse in childhood thyrotoxicosis. A total of 32 patients with Graves disease were included in the study. Several features were correlated with a tendency to relapse. Of these features, sex, family history, and antibody status were not significantly correlated to relapse. However, of 17 patients with goiter size two times normal or larger, 16 relapsed in comparison with seven relapses of 15 patients with goiter size less than two times normal (p = 0.0039). Of eight patients without ophthalmopathy, only two relapsed, while 21 patients of 24 patients with ophthalmopathy, relapsed (p = 0.002). Of 13 patients with serum thyroxine levels below 20 mcg/dl, six relapsed; of the 19 patients with serum thyroxine levels above 20 mcg/dl, 17 relapsed (p = 0.039). Among 24 patients with a previous relapse, only one achieved a remission with a second course of treatment. The remaining 23 patients had recurrent relapses. Hence it was found that goiter size, presence of ophthalmopathy, total thyroxine levels, and a previous relapse correlated significantly with a further relapse.\r"

It has been appreciated that thumb polydactyly could range from a broadened distal phalanx to complete duplication of the entire thumb. Most cases are sporadic and unilateral, but rare familial cases with wide variability and occasional nonpenetrance have been described. Four unrelated families are described who have thumb polydactyly as part of the range of expression for a dominant gene that is frequently associated with absence of thenar intrinsic muscles and flexor pollicis longus with inability to flex the thumb across the palm (the Fromont anomaly). These families and previous literature reports suggest that expression of the gene can range from thumb hypoplasia (most commonly the Fromont anomaly) to triphalangeal thumb or thumb polydactyly. As a consequence of this experience, we urge that parents, siblings, and other close relatives of patients born with thumb polydactyly be carefully examined for mild degrees of thumb hypoplasia or any other thumb anomaly, and that these findings be considered when providing recurrence risk counseling.\r"

Appetite control was the most frequently reported basis for guessing PPA, even by placebo participants. Lack of adverse drug reactions was the most frequently reported basis for guessing placebo, even by PPA participants. Participants receiving either PPA or placebo and guessing PPA lost more weight, had less diet difficulty, and had more adverse drug reactions than had participants receiving either PPA or placebo and guessing placebo. Although blindness was probably maintained in the PPA group, the placebo group seems to have been, at least at the study's end, unblinded.

The effects of chronic acetaminophen dosing (1000 mg three times/day for 7 days) on a single 100 mg tablet of fenoldopam were studied in a second crossover study in seven additional volunteers. Concomitant dosing with fenoldopam with acetaminophen resulted in increases in peak fenoldopam plasma concentration and AUC after both single (+32% and +50%, respectively) and chronic (+73% and +66%, respectively) acetaminophen dosing. Decreases in peak plasma concentrations and AUC for fenoldopam's sulfated metabolites were seen in both studies. These findings indicate a metabolic basis for the interaction between fenoldopam and acetaminophen, presumably through a competition for inorganic sulfate.\r"

Three subjects were studied in a three-way crossover of fenoldopam at doses of 0.025, 0.10, and 0.50 microgram/kg/min. Fenoldopam decreased diastolic blood pressure and increased pulse rate without changing systolic blood pressure. Fenoldopam produced dose-related increases in para-aminohippuric acid clearance up to 75% at the 0.50 microgram/kg/min dose. This increase in renal blood flow was accompanied by increases in urine volume, water, and solute excretion; glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. Doses greater than 0.25 microgram/kg/min caused flushing and nasal congestion. The dopamine receptor antagonist metoclopramide (0.1 mg/kg/hr) did not block the systemic hemodynamic effects of fenoldopam but attenuated the increase in para-aminohippuric acid clearance. Fenoldopam plasma levels achieved steady state between 30 and 120 minutes after the start of the infusion and were linear with respect to infusion rate. Our findings show that intravenous fenoldopam causes systemic arteriolar vasodilation, accompanied by renal vasodilation and increased sodium excretion.\r"

Each study was repeated 1 to 3 weeks later to evaluate reproducibility. Neither the dose of isoproterenol required to raise the heart rate by 25 bpm (2.32 +/- 0.81 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.46 micrograms on day 1 and 1.28 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.25 micrograms on day 2) nor the slopes of the dose-response curves were affected by theophylline. Higher heart rates were observed after isoproterenol bolus dosing during theophylline than during saline infusion because of additive chronotropic effects of theophylline and isoproterenol. Since theophylline does not interact in a synergistic fashion with isoproterenol, phosphodiesterase inhibition appears to be an unlikely mechanism of the chronotropic effect of methylxanthines at therapeutic concentrations.\r"

Five patients with myocardial infarction, six patients with venous thromboembolism, and two normal volunteers were studied. The patients with myocardial infarction received 500,000 U over 30 minutes, the patients with venous thromboembolism received 250,000 U over 30 minutes followed by 100,000 U/hr over 16 to 78 hours, and the normal volunteers received 100,000 U over 15 minutes. Plasma streptokinase levels were measured based on the amidolytic activity of the streptokinase-plasminogen complex on the chromogenic substrate S-2251. Pharmacokinetic parameters were: biologic half-life 82 +/- 25 minutes, total clearance 10.8 +/- 8.8 ml/min, and apparent volume of distribution 1.10 +/- 0.71 l. Streptokinase levels declined progressively during the continuous, prolonged infusion in the patients with venous thromboembolism over 60 hours of treatment. We conclude that there are distinct time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetics of streptokinase during continuous intravenous infusion and that this phenomenon is likely to be associated with progressively decreasing thrombolytic efficacy.\r"

The formation of 2- and 5-dehydrospartein displayed monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In livers from PMs the formation of the major sparteine metabolite 2-dehydrosparteine was characterized by more than a thirtyfold increase in Michaelis-Menten constant (Km)(1880 +/- 1044 mumol/L) as compared with EM subjects with an MR less than 1 (58.3 +/- 38.8 mumol/L). EM subjects with an MR greater than 3 who may constitute heterozygous metabolizers showed Km values in between (658 +/- 301 mumol/L). There was no difference in maximum rate of metabolism (Vmax) of 2-dehydrosparteine formation between EM and PM subjects (101 +/- 39 vs. 86 +/- 52 pmol/min/mg). The formation of 5-dehydrosparteine exhibited a Km of 100 +/- 123 mumol/L similar to the Km of 2-dehydrosparteine formation. The urinary MR correlated positively with the Km for 2-dehydrosparteine formation. The intrinsic clearance for 2-dehydrosparteine showed a highly significant negative correlation with the MR. The pronounced differences in Km together with the significant correlation between Km and MR with no marked differences in Vmax between phenotypes suggest that the impaired oxidation capacity in PM subjects is more likely the result of a P-450 isozyme with altered catalytic properties rather than a decreased amount of enzyme.\r"

Serum and urine concentrations were measured during 24 hours. The groups did not differ in the time or the height of the peak serum concentration. Thereafter the children had lower serum concentrations. They had a shorter elimination half-life (means: 1 to 3 years, 3.7 hours; 8 to 10 years, 5.4 hours; adults, 11.2 hours), because of the smaller volume of distribution (0.86 l/kg; 1.08 l/kg; 1.31 l/kg) and higher total clearance (2.8 ml/min/kg; 2.4 ml/min/kg; 1.4 ml/min/kg). The higher clearance in children was mainly nonrenal (metabolism). Calculation of the pharmacokinetic variables per unit of body surface area modified the age differences considerably. Compared with present dosage recommendations, trimethoprim in larger daily doses per kilogram of body weight for the children is suggested. The daily dose should be increased primarily by shortening the dose interval.\r"

Pharmacokinetic parameters returned to initial values within 30 days after ticlopidine withdrawal. Moreover, no changes in theophylline pharmacokinetic parameters were observed 3 months later, before and after 10 days of placebo administration.

Six were classified as affected by partial deficiency and three as unaffected. The plasma ammonium concentration showed no change after the alanine load in the unaffected group, but marked increases occurred in all but one of the affected groups. The maximum rate of urea synthesis after the alanine load was decreased by 37% (P = 0.02) and delayed by 43% (P = 0.02) in the affected group. In the affected group a low rate of urea synthesis was associated with high urinary orotate excretion, high maximum plasma ammonium concentration and delay in the time taken to reach the maximum rate of urea synthesis (Kendall concordance W = 0.55, P less than 0.05). The effects of a higher dose of alanine and of oral protein were compared. The alanine load of 0.25 g of alanine/kg body weight was shown to provide an adequate stimulus to urea synthesis with a more rapid return of ammonium concentration to the pre-load level than with the protein load. The implication of these results in determining the distribution of flux control of urea synthesis, the discrepancy between them and predicted results and the necessary modifications to quantitative simulations are discussed.\r"

VIP had significant effects on the renal circulation without changing systemic arterial pressure or pulse rate. There was a significant fall from control in effective renal plasma flow (P less than 0.05 renal infusion, P less than 0.01 intravenous infusion) and glomerular filtration rate (P less than 0.01 renal, P less than 0.05 intravenous). The derived renal vascular resistance rose significantly from control (P less than 0.01 renal, P less than 0.01 intravenous). Despite the significant decline in filtered sodium load (P less than 0.01 renal, P less than 0.001 intravenous), there was a significant log dose-related increase in fractional sodium excretion (P less than 0.005) with intrarenal infusion of VIP. We conclude that the actions of VIP on intrarenal blood vessels and renal tubules are direct, leading to increases in renal vascular resistance and fractional sodium excretion.\r"

We have investigated the possibility that delayed small bowel transit of chyme and bile may also contribute to this sluggish recycling. Plasma cholylglycine, total bile acids and cholecystokinin concentrations were measured after a lactulose-labelled test meal whose mouth-caecum transit time (M-C TT) was assessed by the breath hydrogen technique. Overall there were no significant differences in plasma bile acid profiles between seven healthy controls and a group of 25 coeliac patients. However, when subjects were divided according to their M-C TT, the 10 with the slowest transit were found to have significant elevation of fasting levels when compared with the 10 with the fastest transit, fasting total bile acids being 3.4 +/- 1.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/l (P less than 0.02) and fasting cholylglycine being 0.43 +/- 0.17 versus 0.06 +/- 0.04 mumol/l (P less than 0.05) respectively. Peak bile acid levels did not differ significantly between subjects with fast or slow transit.

When flow was occluded the baseline value was reproducible (coefficient of variation 2% between subjects), whereas basal and maximum flow were poorly reproducible even within subjects. Synchronous changes in thermal clearance were seen when two probes were used on fingers and toes of different limbs (r = 0.77 - 0.97), in keeping with a central control mechanism. Fingertip blood flow, as measured by thermal clearance, correlated with Po2 of venous blood draining from the dorsum of the hand (r = 0.72 - 0.92). Contralateral hand cooling caused a sharp reduction of fingertip thermal clearance by 44.2 +/- 3.7%. Thermal clearance traces were damped in fingers with heavy keratinization, and improved when keratin was removed. Comparisons with venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) and photoelectric plethysmography (PPG) showed that thermal clearance correlates with both methods (r = 0.60 - 0.92 for VOP and 0.64 - 0.93 for PPG) but with much integration of the signal and a 10 s lag.

The effects of field stimulation on follicular cell membrane potential and input resistance have been investigated using continuous intracellular recordings from individual cells. Electrical field stimulation promotes up to an eightfold increase in throxine release from the thyroid gland in vitro. This effect is blocked by the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin. Electrical field stimulation has no effect on follicular cell membrane potential or input resistance. This is consistent with the results of previous pharmacological experiments using this preparation. It is concluded that electrical field stimulation induces intrathyroidal nerves to release their neurotransmitters, and that the net effect of this is to cause thyroxine release from the thyroid follicles. The existence of a directly acting secretomotor innervation to the thyroid follicle is suggested.\r"

The patients were subjected to pharmacological blockade under resting conditions in two experimental sessions: first session, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight); second session, atropine (0.04 mg/kg body weight) followed by propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight). All drugs were administered intravenously. Resting heart rate was significantly reduced from 100 +/- 6.5 beats/min to 72 +/- 2.5 beats/min (P less than 0.005) after clinical and laboratory control of the disease. After double blockade, intrinsic heart rate was reduced from 105 +/- 6.8 beats/min before treatment to 98 +/- 6.0 beats/min after treatment (P less than 0.025). The reduction in heart rate caused by propranolol was not significantly different before (-13 +/- 1.4 beats/min) and after (-9 +/- 1.0 beats/min) propylthiouracil. In contrast, atropine induced a higher elevation of heart rate after treatment (45 +/- 8.6 beats/min) than before treatment (26 +/- 4.0 beats/min). The present results suggest no appreciable participation of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system in the tachycardia of hyperthyroidism, at least under the conditions of the present study. The small change observed in intrinsic heart rate, although significant, seems to indicate that this is not the most important mechanism involved in this tachycardia. Our results suggest that an important reduction in the efferent activity of the parasympathetic component participates in the mechanisms that modify resting heart rte in hyperthyroidism.\r"

The ventricles, kidney and liver of newborn SHR, Wistar and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were analysed for their protein and DNA content. Total organ weight and the organ/body weight ratio of the heart and kidney but not of the liver were significantly greater in the SHR than in the control rats, irrespective of total body weight. The higher relative DNA content (per 100 mg of tissue or 100 g body weight) indicated that hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy was responsible for the enlarged heart as well as the kidney of newborn SHR. The cause of this selective cardiac and renal hyperplasia is not yet known: it may be due to putative 'haemodynamic growth stimuli', an intrinsic genetic abnormality of cells in the heart and kidney, circulating growth-promoting factors, or innervation.\r"

Basal serum thyrotrophin (TSH) levels, although within the euthyroid range, were increased in the patients as compared with the controls. There was no significant difference in the TSH responsiveness to metoclopramide between the study groups. However, in the five patients with exaggerated responses of TSH to metoclopramide, basal TSH levels were significantly higher than in the other patients.

  ".W": "The renal clearance of dextran and protein of different molecular sizes has been measured in 42 proteinuric patients with diabetes and glomerulonephritis. In both patient groups the fractional low molecular (radii 3.0-3.6 nm) dextran clearances were significantly decreased whereas the fractional high molecular (radii 5.1-7.8 nm) dextran clearances were increased as compared with the controls. A porosity/charge index was constructed by calculating the ratio of fractional clearances of neutral to anionic macromolecules (theta D3.6/theta ALB, theta D5.1/theta IgG). In diabetic patients the relation between the fractional clearances of neutral and anionic macromolecules was dependent on glomerular filtration rate. It seems likely that the altered glomerular permeability in diabetic nephropathy is associated with a decrease of charge as renal function deteriorates. In glomerulonephritis the process is different and there is a high degree of variation from case to case.\r"

  ".W": "In studies on intestinal adaptation it is often important to obtain contemporaneous data on the rate of cell production and the functional status of the intestine. The measure of the rate of accumulation of vincristine arrested metaphases in microdissected intestinal crypts to determine the crypt cell production rate (CCPR), is one of the most effective methods of estimating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation which is robust enough to withstand scrutiny. However, studies in the field of intestinal adaptation could be much more informative if a valid measure of intestinal function could also be included. One such method is the water absorption capacity in vitro. The intraperitoneal injection of vincristine sulphate (1 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the water absorption capacity of the small intestine, as measured by the segmented flow single pass perfusion method; thus the CCPR of the jejunum and intestinal water absorption were both measured in 19 groups of hypo- and hyper-proliferative rats which should have been in a relatively 'steady state' of cell production and turnover. The minimum values were obtained after hypophysectomy and the maximum values were observed in lactation. CCPR and absorption were significantly correlated (P less than 0.001) with each other. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) correlation between both CCPR and absorption and dry weight of the intestinal segment studies with food intake. Body weight was a poor predictor of either CCPR or absorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The high K+ diet reduced blood pressure by approximately 10 mmHg during the development of hypertension. Blood pressure, however, plateaued at the same maximum level as control by age 13 weeks. Rats fed the high K+ diet showed a significant increase in water intake and urine volume throughout the treatment period but no change in plasma volume or extracellular fluid volume occurred. A slight natriuresis was also observed in rats on the high K+ diet, but this was not of sufficient magnitude to decrease total body Na+. These results confirm previous findings that K+ causes a diuresis and a natriuresis, but demonstrate that the diuretic action of K+ cannot explain its antihypertensive properties in young SHR.\r"

  ".W": "The initial heart rate (HR) response evoked by standing up and 70 degrees head-up tilt from the supine resting position, as well as the changes in HR and blood pressure after 1-2 min in the upright position, was analysed in teenage boys (aged 10-15 years) and healthy old men (aged 60-90 years). Standing up induced a characteristic temporary HR increase that lasted 20 s and far exceeded the gradual initial HR rise induced by head-up tilt. The main effect of age on the initial HR transients was a definite diminution of the response. After 1-2 min standing and tilting, young subjects showed a pronounced increase in HR and diastolic pressure with little change in systolic pressure. In contrast, old subjects showed a lesser increase in HR and diastolic pressure and a decrease in systolic pressure. A fall in systolic pressure of greater than 20 mmHg after 1 min of active standing was, however, not observed. It is concluded that the circulatory adjustment to the stress of postural change differs markedly between young and elderly subjects. In healthy old subjects marked postural hypotension appears to be rare.\r"

  ".W": "Voluntary muscle activity in chick embryos was paralysed by administration in ovo of tubocurarine hydrochloride, administered in single or multiple doses, from day 9 to day 13 after fertilization. Control eggs were given saline instead of tubocurarine or were simply incubated without operative interference. Embryos were killed at 9, 13, 14, 16 and 19 days after fertilization. Flexor digitorum tendons were removed, fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in plastic, sectioned, and stained with phosphotungstic acid for electron microscopy. The diameters of the tendon collagen fibrils were measured, on electron micrographs, using a Magiscan Mk II programme. Tendon collagen fibril expansion was not inhibited by tubocurarine treatment. It is concluded that the rapid increase of collagen fibril diameters, which coincides in the normal embryo with the first onset of use of the associated muscle, is not dependent on muscle activity. There remains a possibility that other ways of producing tension in the tendon could provide sufficient stimulus to fibril expansion.\r"

Most immediate scratch-chamber test reactions were provoked by vegetables and spices in patients with birch pollen allergy, and most delayed reactions from spices in patients with allergy to balsam of Peru, and from onion and leek. The evaluation of allergic and irritant reactions was difficult. Positive open application tests were seen in about 75% of patients with immediate or delayed scratch-chamber reactions. Immediate reactions from vegetables, fish and meat, and delayed reactions from orange and lemon peel and onion showed the best clinical relevance. Wet work, surface active agents and other irritant factors were considered the main causes, and food allergies as contributory factors only in food handler hand dermatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Open, closed and intradermal testing with NiCl2 was performed in 15 subjects with patch-test-proven allergy to 5% NiSO4 in pet. Intradermal testing proved to be a reliable method in confirming nickel sensitivity within 24 h. Open testing with non-toxic concentrations of NiCl2 in alcohol resulted in 73% and 93% positive reactions at 24 h and 48 h readings, respectively. This test method can be used as a reliable screening method in nickel allergy. Open testing often resulted in positive reactions within a few hours. This makes it possible to investigate pathogenetic events of acquired allergic contact dermatitis at a much earlier stage than with the usual 48-h occlusion. 24-h occlusion with Finn Chambers is not sufficient if one is to avoid false negative reactions in nickel allergy. Occlusion with Finn Chambers seems to delay the reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The response after application of various concentrations of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) on human skin is reported. The induced changes associated variable degrees of roughness and erythema characterizing rough dermatitic skin (RDS). These clinical changes were almost invariably (less than 5% experimental error) associated with increased values of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and increased cutaneous blood flow values (CBFV). A significant positive correlation was found between TEWL and CBFV at all concentrations of SLS. However, values of TEWL higher than those found in 84% of the controls (mean + SD: 8.127 + 2.89 gr/m2/h) were usually significantly correlated with clearcut clinical changes (total clinical score greater than 2 or erythema greater than 1) at all concentrations of SLS, while CBFV (mean + SD of controls: 2.717 + 2.165) which had a wider dispersion, were significantly associated only with erythema after 10% and 1% SLS. This reflects the distinction that is being made between a primary chemical insult, which we identify clinically as roughness and functionally as increased TEWL associated with alterations of barrier function of the skin, and a secondary, delayed inflammatory response, which is clinically recognized as erythema and functionally objectivated by increased CBFV. These results provide a rational basis supporting the use of this experimental model of RDS for testing of preventive and therapeutic efficacy as well as refining the evaluation of tolerance of cosmetics especially designed for use on sensitive skin.\r"
