  ".W": "Several patients hospitalized in our 12-bed medical ICU were found to have Clostridium difficile associated colitis. Stool cultures of all patients identified eight cases (three culture positive, and five culture and cytotoxin positive), seven of which were geographically and temporarily clustered within a 2-wk period. At least one patient appeared to contract the disease after hospitalization and in the absence of antibiotic therapy or other known major risk factors. The outbreak highlights the problem of C. difficile in the ICU. We believe that a heightened awareness of the multiple risk factors and preventive measures, along with consideration of possible nosocomial transmission, will be necessary to prevent or arrest future clusters of cases in the ICU. The diagnosis of one patient with this infection in a unit should prompt a review of all other patients within the unit.\r"

  ".W": "Physicians often must make prognostic judgments for critically ill patients, but we know little about how well they can perform this task. We prospectively measured disagreements among different physicians' quantitative prognostic judgments for 269 sequential admissions to an ICU, and evaluated the accuracy and discriminating ability of judgments made by different types of physicians. Many (44.7%) patients provoked one or more disagreements of at least 20 percentage points among the three possible pairings of physicians. Many patients whom one physician thought were certain to survive did not inspire such certainty in another of their doctors. The critical care attendings thought the changes of survival were less than or equal to 80% for 23, and between 81% and 95% for another 46 of 85 patients whom the patients' own attendings thought were certain to survive. There were some differences in the accuracy of the different physicians' estimates. All doctors showed excellent overall discriminating ability, but discriminated less well for postoperative patients. Lack of consensus about how to judge prognosis for critically ill patients may make it difficult to decide whom to admit to ICUs. These results underscore the need for valid predictive models to aid in decision-making for critically ill patients.\r"

Performance of left ventriculography early in the hospital course of patients with severe unexplained congestive heart failure (with normal or near-normal left ventricular systolic function assessed noninvasively) identifies patients with severe silent mitral regurgitation who may have long-term benefit from mechanical therapy.\r"

The cumulative distribution of oxygen saturation, the number and distribution of desaturation events, and the duration and type of apneas are assessed. Analysis is performed separately during the total recording time and during the time when the patient sleeps on his back. We have compared the automatic analysis with the results obtained on simultaneous daytime polysomnograph naps in 55 subjects (snorers or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [OSAS] patients). The compressed graphs obtained automatically demonstrated a periodic breathing pattern in all 22 patients who presented sleep-related apneas at polygraphic recording. The cumulative distribution of oxygen saturation was not as steep in the apnea patients as in patients not showing apneas; in 19 of the 22 OSAS patients, the value was outside our normal limits (80 percent of the recording time inside 3.6 percent SaO2 variation band). The apnea index (AI) was 26.4 in manual and 23.3 in automatic analysis. Using the automatic method there were three false negative cases in the analysis of desaturations; in these patients periodic breathing was present in output graphs indicating need for further polygraphic assessment. The duration of apneas in the automatic analysis was shorter than in manual analysis, but the agreement was sufficient for screening purposes (mean error less than 3 s, mean duration of apneas 20.1 s). The automatic method is presently used in clinical routine for screening purposes, for assessment of the severity of the disorder and the type of treatment that a subject may need, in epidemiologic investigation and follow-up of the treatment.\r"

Ten male patients with OSA syndrome underwent an initial polysomnogram with monitoring of EEG, EOG, myohyoid EMG, oral and nasal airflow, abdominal and thoracic movement, and SaO2. The patients were then entered into a randomized, double-blind crossover study using MPA, 150 mg/day, and MPA placebo. Each patient took tablets for one week and then had a second polysomnogram. After a three week washout, the patient again took tablets for a week prior to the third and final sleep study. There was no significant difference between drug and placebo for DBE time (expressed as a percentage of sleep time), DBE frequency, DBE mean duration or mean fall in O2 saturation during DBEs. We conclude that treatment with MPA does not alter indices of severity of the OSA syndrome.\r"

We hypothesized that inspiratory muscle strength, as assessed by resting, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) may be an important determinant of maximum exercise capacity in patients with CAO. Twenty ambulatory male patients (mean age, 56 +/- 3 years [+/- SE]) with CAO (FEV1, 1.72 +/- 0.21 L) comprised the studied population. Oxygen consumption at incremental cycle ergometry to tolerance (VO2max, 1.80 +/- 0.20 L/min) served as the dependent variable for regression vs measures of resting pulmonary function. Significant correlations with VO2max included power output in watts (r = 0.951), VEmax (r = 0.858), Dsb (r = 0.841), PIP (r = 0.816), age (r = -0.809), FEV1 (r = 0.763), and FVC (r = 0.663). The FEV1, Dsb, and PIP each entered into a multiple linear regression relationship describing VO2max. Also, when paired with VEmax as independent variables in multiple regression, PIP and Dsb each improved description of VO2max over VEmax alone (p less than 0.05), whereas FEV1 and FVC did not (p greater than 0.05). We conclude that factors other than ventilatory capacity also have a quantitative effect on VO2max and that PIP constitutes a determinant of maximum exercise capacity in patients with CAO.\r"

Twenty patients had malignant aspirates; 12 had both histologic and cytologic specimens demonstrating malignancy; six patients had malignant histologic specimens; two had cancerous cytologic specimens as their only evidence of mediastinal disease. Of the nine negative aspirates, four were true negative at surgery. Five patients had false-negative aspirates. Overall sensitivity of the Wang 18-gauge histology needle in the mediastinal staging of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma was 80 percent. When patients with small cell carcinoma were excluded, sensitivity was 82 percent. The enhanced yield of the 18-gauge histology needle warrants its use in mediastinal staging of bronchogenic carcinoma. We conclude that all patients with bronchogenic carcinoma and mediastinal adenopathy demonstrated on chest CT accessible via TBNA should undergo histology needle aspiration as an initial staging procedure.\r"

The VT cycle length was 447 +/- 92 ms (mean +/- SD). During VT, cardiac index fell from 2.32 +/- 0.54 to 1.62 +/- 0.63 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001), and systemic systolic blood pressure fell from 129 +/- 18 to 107 +/- 18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure showed a rising trend from 9 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 12 mm Hg, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure rose from 10.2 +/- 1.6 to 24.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). By echo-Doppler the ejection fraction and the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation were not significantly changed during VT. The mean maximal left ventricular inflow tract velocities, mean time velocity integrals, and the mean time velocity integrals normalized for heart rate (measures of left ventricular diastolic filling) decreased from 0.59 +/- 0.074 to 0.40 +/- 0.053 m/s (p less than 0.05), from 0.12 +/- 0.029 to 0.021 +/- 0.012 m (p less than 0.001), and from 7.43 +/- 1.20 to 3.21 +/- 1.49 m x beats/min (p less than 0.001) during VT, respectively. We conclude that hemodynamic changes during stable sustained VT are neither associated with significant changes in systolic left ventricular function nor related to valvular regurgitation and are likely caused by impaired left ventricular diastolic filling.\r"

Technical problems including warning lights and messages with the two ear oximeters were recorded. There were significantly more technical problems in patients with the darkest skin color associated with inability to obtain a reading or warning message indicating poor tissue penetration of the signal (18 and 15 percent vs 1 percent). When readings could be obtained, the ear oximetry readings were found to be slightly less accurate in the darker patient groups. These findings suggest that dark skin color may affect the performance and accuracy of ear oximeters, including the newer type of pulse oximeters.\r"

The NDC was larger in the recurrent group than in the nonrecurrent group in terms of mean nuclear DNA content (MNDC), DNA histogram pattern, and occurrence of the aneuploid stem cell line, of which the difference in MNDC was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). When the comparison of NDC was made between the nonrecurrent and recurrent groups in the well differentiated (W/D), moderately to poorly differentiated (M.P/D), T1, and T2 subgroups, the NDC of the recurrent group was significantly larger than that of the nonrecurrent group in the W/D (MNDC, p less than 0.01 and DNA histogram pattern, p less than 0.005) and T1 subgroups (MNDC, p less than 0.05), but not in the M.P/D and T2 subgroups. The results indicate that the NDC is a good predictor of prognosis in stage I adenocarcinoma of the lung and its prognostic importance increases in more differentiated and smaller tumors, compared to less differentiated and larger tumors.\r"

The diagnosis and the surgical indication were based on two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography without cardiac catheterization and angiography. In all patients the echocardiographic diagnosis was confirmed at surgery in terms of presence, dimension and location of the membrane and in ten patients in terms of pressure gradients. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has proved to be a very reliable tool for the diagnosis and surgical indication in pediatric patients with a DSAS. Our criteria for the selection of surgical patients are the following: (1) isolated form of discrete subaortic stenosis with a short base of attachment to the ventricular septum; (2) pressure gradients higher than 25 mm Hg; (3) presence of significant aortic insufficiency. All of this information can be consistently obtained with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography.\r"

Although the Pearson correlation coefficient between the PPV was consistently high, ranging between 0.854 and 0.892, the assumption that such a finding substantiates the substitution of PEF for FEV1 is called into question. Over 50 percent of the subjects displayed a 10 percent or greater difference in the PPV between the two measurements, regardless of the time of day the two respiratory variable were determined, while over one-third of all subjects evidenced a 20 percent or greater discrepancy between the PPV of the two measures. While, on a group basis, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean percentage difference over 24 hours between the PPV of FEV1, when compared with the corresponding measurement of PEF, reliance on PEF alone in individual subjects may result in a false impression of the patency of the airways in comparison to the FEV1.\r"

In preliminary clinical trials, patients have developed various degrees of respiratory insufficiency following administration of rTNF. Twenty-seven patients were studied prospectively to evaluate the effect of administration of rTNF on pulmonary function. Sixteen of the 27 patients completed the eight-week course of daily IM injection of rTNF. Spirometric data and Dsb were measured at baseline and on days 8, 15, and 56 of treatment. Both patients with and without progressive pulmonary metastases demonstrated a comparable mean decline in Dsb (-10.7 +/- 9.6 percent [+/- SD] and 14.7 +/- 10.0 percent, respectively; p less than 0.01) not accounted for by either a decline in the hemoglobin content of the blood or a reduction in alveolar volume. Marked interindividual variability in the response of Dsb to rTNF therapy was noted. The reduction in Dsb reached a plateau by day 15. In contrast, alveolar volume and FVC remained essentially unchanged throughout the course of treatment. Measurements of Dsb performed two weeks after cessation of rTNF therapy in seven of the 27 patients showed only a modest trend toward recovery, which was not statistically significant. We conclude that the administration of rTNF for the treatment of malignant neoplasms in this dosage and schedule can cause significant pulmonary injury reflected by a reduction in Dsb which reaches a plateau by two weeks after initiation of therapy.\r"

Lavage procollagen peptide levels were significantly elevated in sarcoidosis patients compared to control subjects (p less than 0.001). No association was observed between lavage type 3 procollagen peptide and disease severity, as assessed by lung function tests. Follow-up monitoring of patients failed to demonstrate any relationship between subsequent functional deterioration and initial lavage type 3 procollagen peptide. These results suggest that elevated lavage type 3 procollagen peptide concentrations in sarcoidosis may reflect increased type 3 collagen synthesis associated with the inflammatory process rather than signal an early event in the development of chronic disease.\r"

We describe our experience with 20 hopelessly ill patients with multiple organ failure vs a similar group treated before the development of the supportive care team. Although there was no difference in mortality (100 percent), the length of stay in the medical ICU for patients with multiple organ failure decreased by 12 days to 6 days. Additionally, there were 50 percent fewer therapeutic interventions provided by the supportive care team vs intensive care or conventional ward treatment of multiple organ failure patients. We describe the methods that the supportive care team uses in an attempt to meet the physical and psychosocial comfort needs of hopelessly ill multiple organ failure patients and their families. This multidisciplinary approach to the care of the hopelessly ill may have applications in other institutions facing the ethical, medical, and administrative challenges raised by these patients.\r"

This feature of PE separates it from pulmonary diseases affecting the airways, which are characterized by nonsynchronous emptying of compartments with an uneven ventilation/perfusion relationship. An analysis of the single breath test (SBT) for CO2, SBT-CO2, focusing on the late tidal expirate, was made in order to evaluate the feasibility to use the SBT-CO2 for the diagnosis of PE. The test was evaluated in 38 patients with suspected PE where pulmonary angiography showed that nine had PE and 29 did not. It was also tested in a reference population consisting of patients with normal lung function, obstructive lung disease and interstitial lung disease. Previously suggested gas exchange measurements for the diagnosis of PE, ie, the physiologic deadspace fraction, VDphys/VT, and the arterial-to-end-tidal CO2 gradient, P(a-E')CO2, were also evaluated in the groups. SBT-CO2 achieved a nearly complete separation between the patients with PE and those without. The other measurements, however, showed a substantial overlap between patients with PE and those with obstructive or interstitial lung disease. The SBT-CO2 is simple and potentially widely available and warrants further study as a routine technique for the diagnosis of PE.\r"

We compared forearm arterial and venous tone and forearm blood flow in ten patients with and ten patients without sepsis. The FVT, MVC, and FBF were measured by air plethysmography. In the septic patients, MCV was 1.4 +/- 0.1 ml compared with 3.1 +/- 0.2 ml in nonseptic patients (p less than 0.01). The FVT was 13.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg/ml in septic patients versus 7.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg/ml in nonseptic patients (p less than 0.01). The ratio of FBF to cardiac output was 0.28 +/- 0.07 percent in septic patients and 0.31 +/- 0.07 percent in nonseptic patients. These data suggest that increased peripheral venous capacitance and redistribution of skeletal muscle blood flow are not present in patients with sepsis.\r"

Neither age nor size of patients, decrease in end-tidal CO2, nor baseline value of PAP correlated with the decreases in PaO2. A decrease in PaO2/FIo2 (more than 50 mm Hg) was observed more frequently in female patients and in patients with cardiac disease, especially those whose PAP values were above normal. Although a significant decrease in PaO2 during PAOP measurements does not appear to occur often, our results suggest that the changes in PaO2 should be evaluated in patients with severely compromised pulmonary oxygenation.\r"

Group 1 (n = 6) had coronary stenoses that did not reduce distal perfusion at rest, but did attenuate hyperemic response, and group 2 (n = 6) had stenoses which reduced resting blood flow. In nonstenosed zones, a doubling in perfusion during DP infusion induced proportionate changes in ENDO and EPI flows (unchanged ENDO/EPI ratio) in group 1 hearts, but increased EPI more than ENDO flows in group 2 hearts (decreased ENDO/EPI ratio). In mildly stenosed regions, a 47 percent increase in perfusion during DP was associated with an increase in only EPI flow, which thereby reduced the ENDO/EPI ratio. In severely stenosed zones, the ENDO/EPI ratio was already significantly reduced at rest and a further reduction in ENDO flow during DP caused a significant decline in the ENDO/EPI ratio. Therefore, during pharmacologic vasodilation, a redistribution of coronary transmural flow occurs (relative ENDO to EPI steal) in non- and mildly stenosed regions while an absolute decrease or steal in ENDO flow was noted only in regions distal to more severe stenoses. These studies suggest that an interaction between the stenosis severity and vasodilation is a determining factor in ENDO/EPI ratios with dipyridamole.\r"

In all cases the heart was hypertrophied and enlarged; one had total thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery with extensive infarction of the ventricular septum. Vascular changes also were found in all hearts, involving small arteries, arterioles, and venules. In the arteries, they involved the intima, media, and adventitia, and perivascular areas in a degenerative and inflammatory process. The elastic tissue was especially affected. A nonspecific myocarditis was present in four cases and epicarditis in all. Changes in the summit of the ventricular septum were present in four cases, consisting of increased fibrosis and arteriolosclerosis. The CS changes varied in location, showing either vasculitis, myocarditis, or fragmentation of the bundle with lobulation and fibrosis. The changes in the conduction system were not as severe as the changes in the surrounding myocardium. In one case the ECG was abnormal, showing left hemiblock. This corresponded to the finding of fibrosis, vacuolization of cells, and space formation in the left bundle branch.\r"

However, a cavitary lung lesion with a bulls-eye appearance was clearly demonstrated by CT. We speculate that such a cavitary lung lesion might be quite common in catheter-induced pulmonary infarction when CT is widely applied to such cases.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of relative polyp locations in 426 consecutive patients with multiple colonic polyps found on colonoscopy showed novel findings. First, synchronous and metachronous neoplastic polyps showed spatial clustering in individual patients. For example, patients with their largest neoplasm in the cecum or proximal ascending colon, had 34.3 percent +/- 4.6 percent (standard error) of their other colonic neoplasms in the same location. Second, hyperplastic polyps showed spatial clustering in individuals that was statistically significantly greater than expected from the increased hyperplastic polyp concentration in the rectum and sigmoid. Third, hyperplastic polyps showed spatial clustering with neoplastic polyps; this clustering was similar in magnitude to clustering for exclusively hyperplastic or neoplastic polyps. In contrast, lipomas were not spatially clustered with hyperplastic and neoplastic polyps. The magnitude of clustering between hyperplasia and neoplasia showed a closer association between these histologic types than previously appreciated. Because of clustering, regions with prior polyps appear to merit closer surveillance. These findings suggest clinical study, using a randomized controlled clinical trial, of whether a patient who had only rectal and sigmoid adenomas on initial and follow-up colonoscopy should have surveillance with flexible sigmoidoscopy alternating annually with colonoscopy. A patient with a prior cecal adenoma should have surveillance only with a complete colonoscopy or adequate cecal views on barium enema.\r"

Twenty-five patients (5 percent) had features of indeterminant colitis (IC), including unusual distribution of inflammation, deep linear ulcers, neural proliferation, transmural inflammation, fissures, creeping fat, and retention of goblet-cell population. The clinical and functional outcome of these 25 IC patients was compared with that of the remaining 489 CUC patients. The mean follow-up was 38 +/- 18 months. No significant differences in complication rates, pouch function, incidence of \"pouchitis,\" or requirement for pouch excision were detected in the two groups at follow-up. Although the authors are continuing to perform IPAA on patients with IC, a better definition of the IC patient and a more objective, prospective analysis of outcome of IC following IPAA is required before confident and specific treatment policies can be recommended.\r"

This study was undertaken to better define this subgroup. Seventeen patients were studied over a period of 20 years who underwent extended resections for colonic adenocarcinoma with upper abdominal organ invasion. The age range was 30 to 81 years (average, 61 years). There was a male-to-female ratio of greater than 2:1. The duration of presenting symptoms was as short as 4 days and as long as 18 months (average, 4.3 months). The most common complaint was weight loss (13/17). The next most common complaints were abdominal pain (10/17), bowel complaints (5/17), and septic symptoms (4/17). A single organ was involved in 7 instances, but multiple organs were involved in most cases. The frequency of involvement was the stomach, spleen, and duodenum (5 each), abdominal wall and diaphragm (4 each), pancreas and liver (3 each). There were 2 perioperative deaths and 9 other major complications. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality was septic in nature in 8 of the 11 instances. All 3 patients with pancreatic resections had postoperative complications; none were fatal. Five patients survived over 10 years, three were 5-year survivors, and two are living and free of disease at less than 5 years. Excluding the two perioperative deaths, four of the five patients who died in less than 5 years had documented recurrences.\r"

Five days later, gut blood flow was measured with 15 microns microspheres, together with hemodynamic and metabolic values. Two other groups provided comparative data: unoperated animals to measure baseline values and sham-operative controls. With adequate hydration, hemodynamic and metabolic values remained stable in the experimental group. There was a two-fold increase (P less than 0.05) in blood flow in the dilated colon proximal to the obstruction site, whereas blood flow to the other organs remained unchanged. These results have relevance for the hemodynamic management and use of primary anastomosis in patients with large-bowel obstruction. Furthermore, these data might implicate increased local bowel blood flow as a contributory factor to the poorer long-term prognosis found in patients with large-bowel cancer presenting with intestinal obstruction.\r"

Due to progression, new colorectal injuries, primarily stricture (55 percent) and fistula (42 percent), occurred in 68 patients (37 percent). Resection provided the best results. However, the resectability rate was low (46 percent) and resection was primarily performed in patients with a circumscript well-defined stricture of the proximal rectum or sigmoid colon with an anastomotic leakage rate of 5 percent. The prevailing management of 78 patients with fistula or stricture with synchronous fistula was defunctioning colostomy, primarily end-sigmoidostomy, providing fair results in half of the patients. Stomal complications occurred in 15 percent. The radiation-induced colorectal mortality was 8 percent. Colorectal fistula and associated radiation injuries of the urinary tract, and especially of the small bowel, were the major determinants of fatal outcome, yielding an overall radiation-induced mortality of 25 percent. After a median observation time of 13 years, half of the patients were alive at follow-up; 56 percent of these had a fair outcome whereas the remaining patients continued to have mild symptoms responding to conservative measures (34 percent) or disabling symptoms (10 percent).\r"

Indications included adenocarcinoma of the low rectum in 9, villous tumor in 2, carcinoid tumor in 1, radiation proctitis in 1, adult onset Hirschprung's disease in 1, rectourethral fistula in 1, and megarectum in 1. There was no in-hospital mortality and no anastomotic dehiscence. The Kirwan classification was used to evaluate functional results. Ninety-three percent of patients expressed satisfaction with their surgical results. Eighty-seven percent of patients are normally continent. A single patient is grossly incontinent. Eight of nine patients with carcinoma were resected for cure. A single patient has died of an unrelated disorder and the remaining seven are free of disease at an average follow-up of 24 months. The authors conclude that coloanal anastomosis is a safe procedure accompanied by minimal morbidity, or risk of local recurrence. Excellent, or at least acceptable, continence can be anticipated in the majority of carefully selected patients. The coloanal anastomosis should be strongly considered in any patient with a low-lying rectal lesion in whom body habitus precludes the possibility of conventional low anterior resection.\r"

The first two groups had an equally low frequency of colon cancers, whereas rats with colovesical fistulas had a significantly higher frequency, and cancers were concentrated at the anastomotic site. It was concluded that prompt healing does not promote cancer in this model. It is probably not responsible for suture-line recurrences seen clinically, nor for the increased frequency of cancer at the site of urinary diversion into the colon.\r"

The primary aim of the trial was to investigate the 5-year survival rate in both groups; a secondary aim was to analyze the local recurrence rate and finally the anatomopathologic tumoral classification after surgery. All patients were followed at least 8 years. The preoperative irradiation group (Group A) was submitted to 4000 cGy for 4 weeks and surgery was performed 1 week after irradiation. All tumors were classified anatomically and pathologically according to Broders' and Dukes' classifications. The results indicated that there is a significant difference in the five-year survival rates in both groups: group A had a corrected survival rate of 80 percent; group B (nonirradiated) had a corrected survival rate of 80 percent; group B (nonirradiated) had a corrected survival rate of 34.4 percent. The local recurrence rate was 2.9 percent in group A and 23.5 percent in group B. Regarding tumor regression, before radiotherapy 64.6 percent of the tumors were Broders' Grades 3 and 4; after radiotherapy these were reduced to 20.5 percent. As to Dukes' classification, 26.4 percent of the tumors were type C in group A and, in group B, 47 percent were considered as Dukes' C.\r"

Resistance to distension was significantly greater in the descending colon at intraluminal volumes of 30 ml or greater (P less than 0.01). An equal number of postmortem studies, representing passive connective tissue resistance, demonstrated a similar but more pronounced difference (P less than 0.001), which was maintained after correction for initial intraluminal diameter differences (P less than 0.001). The differences between in vivo and postmortem results indicated an active muscular component in the response of the ascending colon to distension compared with a totally passive distal response. These results support the concept of a functional division in the human colon.\r"

Colonic transit studies defined four groups: normal CTT (N = 49), right colonic stasis (N = 16), outlet obstruction (N = 12), and isolated left colonic stasis (N = 14). Right colonic stasis and outlet obstruction were associated with frequent use of digital pressure to assist defecation. Right colonic stasis was characterized by a low stool frequency (less than 3 per week) in 93% of cases and failure to respond to bran therapy. Outlet obstruction also showed a poor response to bran therapy but weekly stool frequency was higher than 3 in 46% of cases. Normal colonic transit time and isolated left colonic stasis were characterized by a normal stool frequency (5.8 +/- 0.05 and 4.2 +/- 0.1, respectively) and clinical help with the use of bran treatment (72 and 64%, respectively). Our study suggested that patients who complain of idiopathic constipation represent a heterogenous group of disorders. Segmental CTT determination is a simple, useful, and noninvasive test of patients with constipation.\r"

We studied the effect of (1) recorder filter characteristics, (2) number of data points and, (3) data window overlap technique and ingestion of a 1000-kcal meal on the resulting power spectrum. Human rectosigmoid slow-wave activity was recorded in nine normal subjects and stored on FM tape for computer analysis. The dynograph filter characteristics were tested using square wave signals, and derived compensation factors were applied to the FFT before viewing. The dynograph filter, when set to optimize visualization of slow waves, attenuates low frequencies nonlinearly. Failure to compensate for the dynograph filter results in inaccurate detection of slow-wave frequencies. FFT of 1-min data gives a different power spectrum than an FFT of 4 min data, indicating a rapidly changing waveform. FFT's of 1 min of data when examined over time fail to demonstrate a consistent frequency spectrum, confirming this conclusion. The lower frequencies in the normal human rectosigmoid are present at the greatest power. These studies indicate that the colon has slow waves of irregular frequencies, in contrast to the stomach or small intestine. No change in the dominant frequency was seen following the ingestion of a 1000-kcal meal.\r"

Germ-free and gnotobiotic rats were operated and studied in germ-free or gnotobiotic conditions. The IDMEC period (mean +/- SD) in the proximal and distal small bowel was significantly longer in germ-free rats (20 +/- 2 min and 102 +/- 14 min) as compared to conventional rats (13 +/- 1 min and 58 +/- 5 min). Association of germ-free rats with a limited flora (gnotobiotic rats) decreased the IDMEC period significantly (15 +/- 1.5 min and 75 +/- 14 min). The migration velocity of the IDMEC was inversely related to the IDMEC period. These observations confirm previous data suggesting that the interdigestive motor complex has a role in the homeostasis of the bacterial content of the small bowel.\r"

  ".W": "To further characterize colonic motility in the dog and to examine the effects of intraluminal contents, motor activity in conscious animals was recorded by perfused intraluminal catheters. Animals were studied first with the bowel intact and, later, the colon was fashioned into an isolated loop. In the fasting state, cycles of motility recurred approximately each 30 min. These consisted of sequences of phasic contractions (bursts) that migrated variable distances in either direction; stationary bursts were also recorded. The fasting patterns recorded from intact bowel and isolated loops were not different. Feeding increased colonic motility, and the mean periodicity of cyclic bursts was reduced significantly to approximately 20 min. Moreover, differences were observed between intact bowel and isolated loops in the postprandial period. Diversion of chyme from the colon significantly reduced the motor response to food, but only in the late (2-4 hr) postprandial period, when the less frequent, fasting cycle returned to the loops. Perfusion of isolated loops with chyme or saline reestablished the postprandial pattern seen in intact bowel. The results suggest that the volume, but not the composition, of luminal contents modify postprandial motility in the canine colon. Additional experiments confirmed that, in particular, volatile fatty acids were probably not important determinants of colonic motility in the dog.\r"

Biopsies were obtained during routine colonoscopy from 33 patients whose colonic mucosa was macroscopically and histologically normal. Regulatory peptides were extracted, and measured by specific radioimmunoassays. Concentrations of three peptides that are present predominantly in endocrine cells within colonic mucosa increased significantly towards the rectum: Mean concentrations of peptide YY, enteroglucagon, and somatostatin were about three times greater in the rectum than in the cecum. However, concentrations of two peptides that are present in mucosal nerve fibers diminished significantly towards the rectum: Mean rectal concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine methionine were both about 0.6 of mean cecal concentrations. Concentrations of all five peptides were lower in biopsies taken from colonic polyps than in normal colonic mucosa. Regional differences in colonic mucosal concentrations of regulatory peptides probably reflect differences in the physiological functions of different parts of the colon.\r"

Extraluminal strain gauge transducers were used to study gastrointestinal motility after Billroth II gastrectomy in four conscious dogs. Gastric emptying was measured radiographically. In Billroth II dogs gastric emptying of low-viscosity meals was biphasic with an initial rapid emptying. The addition of nutrients to low-viscosity meals delayed gastric emptying accompanied with reduction in gastric and jejunal motility. Similar to that in Roux-Y dogs, gastric emptying of noncaloric medium-viscosity meals was delayed because of segmenting motor patterns of the jejunal loops, in contrast to the propulsive jejunal motor pattern in intact dogs. Nutrients added to medium-viscosity meals did not change the jejunal motor pattern; gastric emptying was delayed compared with intact dogs. Results show that meal viscosity and jejunal motor pattern influence gastric emptying after Billroth II gastrectomy.\r"

Total and segmental colonic transit times were investigated by radiopaque marker transit time in all patients. Eleven patients also had rectoanal and esophageal manometries, combined with urodynamic study in eight cases. The results show that total radiopaque marker transit time was increased, 201 +/- 14 hr (mean +/- SE), with two main regions of decreased transit rates: the right colon (42% of global transit time) and the rectosigmoid (36%). Delayed transit of radiopaque markers in nine of 11 cases was combined with esophageal motor dysfunction and absence of rectoanal inhibitory reflex. In three of eight cases there was disinhibition of urinary bladder contraction, and micturition was impossible in two of eight cases. We conclude that patients on ventilator for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease always have a delayed colonic transit time with diffuse digestive and bladder motor dysfunction.\r"

Jejunal motility was recorded with multiple closely spaced extraluminal transducers. Contractile patterns were analyzed by a special computerized method. Following a Billroth-II gastrectomy without additional vagotomy, the migrating motor complex was often disrupted and replaced by a motor pattern that consisted of contractions propagating aborally and retrograde. The propagation velocity was significantly faster compared with that of phase III contraction waves. In intact dogs, both the fasted and fed motor patterns showed a negligible number of orally propagated contractions. These results show that it is possible to differentiate between aborally and orally propagating contractions by a computerized method. Orally propagated contractions occur frequently after subtotal gastrectomy with gastroenterostomy but are an uncommon feature in intact dogs.\r"

Subjects were assessed for their degree of analgesia and amnesia for the procedure, prior experience with endoscopy, and willingness to undergo another similar procedure should such be necessary. The patients were randomized single blind to receive either midazolam or diazepam for their preprocedure sedation. The amount of preprocedure sedation utilized was determined by titration of the dose to achieve slurring of speech. Prior to receiving either agent, the subjects were shown a standard card containing pictures of 10 common objects, were asked to name and remember them, and were told they would be \"quizzed\" (at 30 min and 24 hr) after being sedated for their recollection as to the objects pictured on the card. Each subject filled out a questionnaire addressing their perceived discomfort during the endoscopic procedure and their memory of the procedure 24 hr after the procedure. Sixty-three percent of the midazolam-sedated subjects reported total amnesia for their colonoscopy vs 20% of diazepam-sedated patients (P less than 0.001). Fifty-three percent of midazolam-sedated patients reported total amnesia of their upper gastrointestinal endoscopy vs only 23% of diazepam-sedated subjects (P less than 0.05). The midazolam-sedated subjects reported experiencing less pain with both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (P less than 0.05) and colonoscopy (P less than 0.001) than did the diazepam-sedated group. Most importantly, the midazolam group was more willing to undergo another similar endoscopic procedure should they be asked to do so by their physician (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results showed that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin labels two types of binding sites, which resemble the ML-1 and ML-2 melatonin subtypes previously described in other tissues. The 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding site identified in whole brain membranes has a nanomolar affinity (Kd = 1.48 +/- 0.26 nM) and biochemical and pharmacological characteristics identical to those of the ML-2 site of Syrian hamster whole brain. The 2-[125I]iodomelatonin site in the hypothalamus has a picomolar affinity (Kd = 43.4 +/- 5.1 pM) and resembles the ML-1 site of chicken retina. The localization of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin labeling in autoradiographic studies of the Djungarian hamster brain includes the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the median eminence, the reuniens nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus.\r"

Cultures were treated with SITS and DIDS under control unstimulated conditions or with PTH. Both SITS and DIDS were found to be potent inhibitors of 45Ca release from previously labeled fetal rat long bones. Both control resorption and the response to PTH were inhibited in a dose-related fashion. SITS and DIDS also inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in bone. The effects on resorption and [3H]thymidine incorporation were reversible when the drugs were withdrawn. These findings indicate that SITS and DIDS are potent inhibitors of bone resorption which may act by blocking the anion exchange, Cl-/HCO3-.\r"

  ".U": "89325131\r", 
  ".W": "In humans, glycyrrhetinic acid (GE), the active pharmacological ingredient of licorice, produces symptoms resembling those caused by excess mineralocorticoid secretion. We are proposing that 11 beta-dehydrogenase inhibition, and not intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity, is the primary mechanism of licorice induced pseudoaldosteronism. Glycyrrhizic acid (glycyrrhetinic acid glucuronide), when given orally to rats, partially inhibited renal 11 beta-dehydrogenase. In rats treated with dexamethasone before glycyrrhizic acid administration there was similar enzyme inhibition, suggesting that antimineralocorticoid effects of dexamethasone in licorice excess states are not mediated through a direct effect on 11 beta-dehydrogenase activity. Dispersed renal proximal tubular preparations, kidney homogenates, and microsomes readily converted corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone. GE and its synthetic analog carbenoxolone inhibited the conversion in these systems in a dose-dependent manner. Corticosteroid 11-oxoreductase, which was present in kidney homogenates at a level 10-20% that of 11 beta-dehydrogenase was not inhibited by any of the agents. With homogenate and microsomes, the Ki of GE was about 10(-9)-10(-8) M; with intact tubules, the Ki of GE was about 10(-5)-10(-6) M. It is suggested that a permeability barrier slows the entry of GE into the tubule cells. We conclude that the effects of licorice on corticosteroid metabolism in the kidney are based on its inhibition of 11 beta-dehydrogenase. Our data, supplemented by published evidence, is inconsistent with the conclusion that interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors accounts for the pharmacological effects of GE.\r"

A 16K fragment derived from cleaved rat (r) PRL has mitogenic and lactogenic activities in PRL bioassays. In this report we analyzed whether 16K rPRL acts through PRL and/or specific 16K receptors. The 16K PRL displaced 23K PRL label with a potency that varied among different tissues. With liver membranes the fragment had only 5-6% the potency of intact PRL, but in whole brain its potency was similar to that of the 23K form. By contrast, 16K PRL was 30 times more effective at displacing [125I]23K rPRL from the kidney membranes than was intact PRL. [125I]16K PRL bound specifically to membranes of kidney, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle, and it was not displaced by intact or cleaved 23K rPRL, intact ovine PRL, or rat or bovine GH. The specific binding of 16K PRL to the kidney changed with incubation time, temperature, and pH and was significantly higher than that of 23K PRL to brain and kidney membranes. However, the specific binding of the 16K was lower in liver and skeletal muscle. The binding sites for 16K PRL in the kidney had a higher affinity than did those for 23K PRL (Kd = 6.9 x 10(-9) vs. 0.8 x 10(-8), respectively), but the opposite was found in the other tissues. The specific 16K PRL-binding sites in different tissues may represent receptors that mediate actions of the fragment that are unshared by intact PRL. Furthermore, 16K PRL binds to 23K receptors with an activity that varies among the target tissues. These results support the notion of distinct PRL isoreceptors in different tissues.\r"

Neither the corpus luteum nor atreitic follicles stained for MIS. During proestrus, dramatic changes occurred in the large preovulatory antral follicles, which early in the day manifest intense MIS-specific staining in the granulosa cells located close to the oocyte, however, at 2300 h, just before ovulation when the germinal vesicle was extruded to indicate resumed meiotic division, MIS staining waned. When the morphology of the late preovulatory stage was created experimentally in 26-day-old immature ovaries by stimulating 48 h earlier with hCG, the intense staining of the granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes from untreated ovaries was lost in the cumulus cells of such hCG-treated animals. This temporal pattern of MIS staining and the prior demonstration that MIS could inhibit in vitro meiosis of oocytes from untreated immature rats suggest that this regressor, well characterized in the fetal testis, might function in the ovary as a regulator of oocyte maturation and follicular development during the adult reproductive cycle.\r"

In the adrenal cells the effect of intact cPTH was also evaluated. In chicken kidney cells, the time- and dose-response patterns of cAMP production were similar for cPTH-(1-34) amide and human (h) PTH-(1-34), whereas rat kidney cells were considerably more sensitive to hPTH-(1-34) than to cPTH-(1-34) amide. The agonist effects of both hPTH-(1-34) and cPTH-(1-34) amide in kidney cells were inhibited by the bovine PTH-(3-34) analog. In chicken adrenocortical cells, cPTH-(1-34) amide stimulated cAMP production and steroid secretion. This action of the peptide was inhibited by bovine PTH-(3-34) and hPTH-(1-34), which by themselves showed no agonist effects. The maximal response of steroid secretion to cPTH-(1-34) amide was significantly lower than that to ACTH, but intact cPTH (supplied as a semipurified parathyroid extract) stimulated steriodogenesis to the same extent as ACTH. In rat adrenocortical cells, intact cPTH stimulated both cAMP formation and steriodogenesis, but cPTH-(1-34) amine showed no agonist effect. The action of the intact hormone in the rat adrenal could be inhibited by cPTH-(1-34) amide. The present results demonstrate the interaction of cPTH-(1-34) with kidney and adrenocortical cells of either chicken or rat. The cAMP and steroidogenic responses of the adrenocortical cells to PTH appear to be dependent (completely in the rat and partially in the chicken) on some sequence beyond the 1-34 region.\r"

Moreover, a polyclonal antibody, anti HEC1, specifically immunoprecipitated the BRL 3A BP from the same conditioned media, as well as from rat cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid and from conditioned medium of cells isolated from the neurointermediate lobe of adult rat pituitary. The same antibody also immunoprecipitated hBP-31 from human CSF. Northern blot analyses showed that rBP-30 mRNA was expressed in adult rat brain and pituitary, fetal brain and liver, and in fetal neurons and newborn astrocytes maintained in culture. We conclude that the BRL 3A BP (rBP-30) is the major insulin-like growth factor binding protein in the rat CNS and may be the rat analog of hBP-31, the predominant BP in human CSF.\r"

Maximal cortisol release by ACTH11-24, but not by ACTH1-24 or ACTH1-10, was enhanced by forskolin. The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil inhibited cortisol release by ACTH1-10, ACTH1-24 or ACTH11-24, suggesting calcium influx to be essential for steroid secretion regardless of the secretagogue. Vanadium, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited cortisol secretion elicited by ACTH1-24 and ACTH1-10 but not that caused by ACTH11-24. These results suggest that there are at least two receptors mediating ACTH1-24-dependent steroid secretion.

The maximal effect of the glycogenolytic action of activin-A, which was about 50% of the glucagon action, was obtained at 10(-9) M. When 10(-9) M activin-A and 5 x 10(-9) M glucagon were added simultaneously, the actions of these two agents were additive. In contrast, there was no additivity when 10(-9) M activin-A and 10(-8) M angiotensin-II were added. Activin-A did not increase cAMP at any doses tested, but induced a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. Activin-A increased the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration even in the presence of 1 microM extracellular calcium, suggesting that activin-A caused calcium release from an intracellular calcium pool(s). The internal calcium pool affected by activin-A appeared to be the same as that affected by either angiotensin-II or vasopressin. When [3H] inositol-labeled hepatocytes were incubated with activin-A, radioactivity in the inositol trisphosphate fraction was rapidly increased. These results indicate that activin-A acts on rat hepatocytes and stimulates glycogenolysis by activating the calcium messenger system.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to identify uterine insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors and examine the regulation of these receptors throughout the estrous cycle and after 17 beta-estradiol (E2) administration to immature rats. We have demonstrated type I IGF receptors in crude uterine membranes by binding and cross-linking experiments. The characteristics of the uterine IGF-I receptor are similar to those reported for other tissues, with a high affinity component (Kd = 0.12 nM; binding capacity = 0.028 pmol/mg protein) and a low affinity component (Kd = 0.98 nM; binding capacity = 0.041 pmol/mg protein). Autoradiographic visualization of [125I]IGF-I binding to uterine sections localized the IGF-I receptors to the smooth muscle cells of the myometrial layer of the uterus, with a higher density of IGF-I receptors in the outer longitudinal layer than in the inner circular layer. In immature rats administration of E2 significantly increased total [125I]IGF-I binding per uterus as early as 6 h after E2 injection. Although [125I]IGF-I binding was significantly increased per mg DNA, because of a more marked increase in membrane protein after E2, [125I]IGF-I binding, when expressed per mg membrane protein, decreased. This change in [125I]IGF-I binding resulted from a change in receptor number with no change in receptor affinity. In mature cycling rats, the proestrous uteri showed the lowest level of [125I]IGF-I binding per mg membrane protein, although because of the greater yield of protein from proestrous uteri, the total [125I]IGF-I-binding capacity of these uteri were greater than that of uteri from other stages of the estrous cycle. The lowest [125I]IGF-I binding was seen in the diestrous uteri. These studies demonstrate the presence of authentic type I IGF-I receptors in the rat uterus localized predominantly to the myometrial smooth muscle cells. In addition, E2 appears to regulate the uterine IGF-I receptor in the immature rat, and the cyclical changes in the mature rat are consistent with a role of E2 in regulation of this receptor in vivo.\r"

A 24-h pretreatment by the neurohypophysial hormones significantly increased the acute (3-h) testosterone production by 1.3- to 3-fold at all ages studied, with the exception of pubertal Leydig cells which responded with a 5- to 7-fold increment of testosterone production (P less than 0.05). The higher responsiveness of pubertal Leydig cells to AVP does not result from an increased sensitivity, since the half-maximal effective doses (ED50) of AVP needed to stimulate testosterone production were quite similar and were in nanomolar range for both pubertal and adult Leydig cells. In addition, the ED50 for OT was 10 times higher than that for AVP. Cycloheximide totally abolished the AVP stimulation, suggesting that the AVP effect is dependent upon new protein synthesis. No modification of hCG-stimulated testosterone production occurred after a 24-h pretreatment of Leydig cells by AVP or OT for all ages studied. A 72-h AVP pretreatment resulted in a marked decrease (50-60%) in acute hCG-stimulated testosterone production in both pubertal and adult Leydig cells. Binding studies of [3H]AVP to purified Leydig cells from prepubertal, pubertal, and adult mice showed the presence of a single set of high affinity V1 sites. The Kd values, in the nanomolar ranges, remained unchanged regardless of age. Maximal capacities were of the same order in the prepubertal and adult Leydig cells (9,460 vs. 10,314 sites/cell), while a 50% decrease (P less than 0.01) in the number of AVP receptors occurred in pubertal Leydig cells (5,048 sites/cell). These data indicate developmental changes in the steroidogenic responsiveness of Leydig cells to neurohypophysial hormones and suggest that AVP receptors might be under a regulatory mechanism(s) during puberty. They provide additional evidence for participation of neurohypophysial hormones in autocrine/paracrine regulation of testicular steroidogenesis.\r"

We have examined whether this reduced PRL release is due to hypothyroidism resulting from destruction of the PVA. Rats were made hypothyroid by thyroidectomy on day 15 of pregnancy or by methimazole treatment from the day of parturition. Electrolytic lesions were placed bilaterally in the PVA on day 15 of pregnancy. The following variables were studied: weight gain of the pups, nursing behavior, thyroid status, and release of PRL. The treatments did not affect the time the mothers spent with the pups but reduced the daily weight gain of the pups. Rats with PVA lesions had reduced PRL and TSH levels during lactation compared with controls. Suckling-induced PRL release after 6 h of separation of mothers and pups was less in PVA-lesioned rats than in controls, but T4-treatment did overcome this blunted response in rats with lesions. Levels of T3 and T4 in PVA-lesioned rats were lower than those in controls. In rats made hypothyroid by thyroidectomy or treatment with methimazole, PRL levels were lower and TSH levels higher than those in euthyroid mothers on days 8, 15, and 22 of lactation. Suckling after 6 h of separation of pups and mothers raised PRL levels both in control and methimazole-treated rats, but in the latter animals the response was blunted. It is suggested that the reduced PRL release in lactating rats with PVA lesions could be due to hypothyroidism resulting from these lesions.\r"

Catecholamine secretion was stimulated by an iv injection of 1.4 mumol (200 micrograms) acetylcholine (Ach). Met-Enk-immunoreactive material in adrenal medulla extracts and dialysate fractions was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC combined with Met-Enk RIA. Under resting conditions, adrenal release rates of norepinephrine and epinephrine into the Ringer solution were constant. After Ach application secretion of both catecholamines increased about 2.7-fold. Within 10 min after the injection, catecholamine levels returned to baseline levels. Intra-adrenal application of Met-Enk reduced Ach-stimulated epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, secretion significantly; application of Nal did not affect Ach-stimulated catecholamine secretion in the initial fraction after Ach injection, but significantly prolonged amine secretion after the cholinergic stimulus. Application of Nal followed by a combined application of Met-Enk and Nal was without an effect on the amount of catecholamines released in the initial fraction after Ach injection compared to that in the control group. Thus, naloxone prevented the inhibitory effect of Met-Enk on Ach-stimulated CA release. HPLC analysis of adrenal medulla extracts followed by Met-Enk RIA revealed that several forms of Met-Enk are present in chromaffin cells, whereas in adrenal dialysates only one, albeit broad, signal of Met-Enk immunoreactivity was detectable. We demonstrate in vivo a paracrine or autocrine action of Met-Enk on Ach-stimulated catecholamine release by applying the peptide directly into the adrenal gland via a microdialysis system. We conclude that neuropeptides endogenous to the adrenal gland not only reduce the amplitude of catecholamine secretion in response to an Ach stimulus but, in addition, modulate the duration of catecholamine secretion. This is demonstrated by a prolonged catecholamine secretion if opiate receptors are blocked by Nal.\r"

We have used osteoclast-like cells formed in vitro to develop a panel of specific antibodies that react with mature osteoclasts, osteoclast precursors, and other cells in the osteoclast lineage. Monoclonal antibody Kn22 reacted strongly with osteoclast-like multinucleated cells formed in long term marrow cultures and reacted very strongly with freshly isolated bone-derived baboon osteoclasts. Using immune cell panning, Kn22 enriched precursors for osteoclasts. The majority of multinucleated cells (71%) formed from fresh marrow mononuclear cells adherent to Kn22 strongly reacted with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes mature osteoclasts (23c6) and responded appropriately to calcitonin. In contrast, only 23% of multinucleated cells formed from marrow mononuclear cells that were not bound by Kn22 formed osteoclast-like cells. The majority (77%) of these multinucleated cells did not strongly react with the osteoclast-specific monoclonal antibody 23c6 or respond to calcitonin. Thus, we have developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize cells in the osteoclast lineage. One of these antibodies, Kn22, is unique in that it identifies an osteoclast precursor. The 50K antigen detected by Kn22 appears to be a membrane protein present on osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts that has not been previously identified.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on the function of the parathyroid glands using primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells. Treatment of parathyroid cell cultures with dexamethasone for 48 h caused a dose-dependent stimulation of PTH secretion. The minimal concentration of dexamethasone required for a significant stimulation of PTH secretion was 0.1 nM. The stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on the secretion of PTH was found within 12 h of treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone. The steroids deoxycorticosterone and cortexolone, which do not have glucocorticoid activity were without effect of PTH secretion. Since glucocorticoids may modulate the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] in other tissues, additional studies were performed to evaluate the interactions of glucocorticoids and 1,25-(OH)2D3. Addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to parathyroid cell cultures for 48 h significantly suppressed PTH secretion. In the presence of dexamethasone, however, 1,25-(OH)2D3 also significantly decreased PTH secretion, although it did not reduce PTH secretion to control levels. The treatment of parathyroid cell cultures with 100 nM dexamethasone did not affect the parathyroid cell content of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors. In summary, these studies indicate that glucocorticoids significantly increase the secretion of PTH in vitro. This stimulatory effect can be inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3. The parathyroid gland is an additional site of physiological antagonism of glucocorticoids and 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

Lambs were placed in individual cages and fed ad libitum. Behavioral features were obtained from continuous polygraphic recording. Blood was collected from undisturbed sheep every 3 min for 24 h via an indwelling catheter connected to a peristaltic pump. One month after the sampling session, ovine GH (oGH) was iv administered to evaluate oGH kinetic parameters. From GH plasma concentrations and oGH kinetic parameters, the instantaneous secretion rate of GH was reconstituted using a numerical deconvolution method. All lambs exhibited normal behavioral patterns. The clearance of oGH was similar for the two groups, and the daily production rates of GH were estimated at 14.60 +/- 7.99 micrograms/kg.24 h in January and 10.57 +/- 5.21 micrograms/kg.24 h in May. Analysis of concentration profiles indicate an episodic pattern of GH secretion into plasma. The mean number of peaks was 16.22 +/- 4.47/24 h, and the mean duration was 47.2 +/- 12.8 min for the nine sheep. When instantaneous secretion rates were taken into account, the number of identified peaks was similar, but the mean duration was reduced (32.9 +/- 9.8 min for the nine sheep). Significant relationships were not found between GH plasma concentration profiles and the state of vigilance, food behavior, or posture. Conversely, when the instantaneous secretion rates were taken into account, the highest GH production rate was detected during rest, i.e. slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, absence of food intake or rumination, and lying down. It is emphasized that the use of GH instantaneous secretion rate instead of GH concentration is of importance when evaluating the relationships between GH dynamics and short duration events. It is concluded that the influence of vigilance on GH secretion, which has already been demonstrated in humans, is likely to exist in other species.\r"

  ".W": "Our recent finding that decidual luteotropin, a PRL-like hormone secreted by the rat decidua, is found primarily in the antimesometrial cells suggests strongly that the synthesis of this hormone may well be an important function of the antimesometrial tissue. The objective of this investigation was, therefore, 1) to determine whether antimesometrial tissue expresses mRNA for and actively secretes a protein(s) with PRL-like activity, and 2) to examine the pattern of protein production by the antimesometrial and mesometrial zones throughout decidual development. RNA obtained from decidual tissue of day 8 pseudopregnant rats was translated in a cell-free system. The translated products were subjected to PRL receptor affinity chromatography in the presence or absence of ovine PRL to assess binding specificity. The eluted 35S-labeled proteins were analyzed by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. A major 28K protein bound specifically to and was eluted from PRL receptor-enriched luteal membranes. This protein also cross-reacted with antibodies to human PRL. To determine where the mRNA for this 28K protein is expressed and whether this protein represents a prohormone, RNA isolated from both antimesometrial and mesometrial tissue was translated in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes. The 28K protein was synthesized specifically by RNA isolated from the antimesometrial zone. No apparent change in the relative mol wt of the 28K protein was observed when translation was performed in the presence of microsomal membranes. To determine whether this protein is a secreted product and to investigate the pattern of protein secretion by the mesometrial and antimesometrial decidua, tissue explants obtained from both zones between days 9-13 of pseudopregnancy were cultured in the presence of [35S]methionine. Antimesometrial tissue secreted one major 28K protein which was capable of binding to PRL receptors on luteal membranes and was immunoprecipitated by antibodies to human PRL, whereas the mesometrial tissue primarily secreted an approximately 180K protein. The overall pattern of protein synthesis and release not only differed between the mesometrial and antimesometrial tissues but also differed with each day of pseudopregnancy. The secretion of several proteins decreased with advancing gestational age, while the secretion of other proteins began abruptly after day 11, coincident with regression of the antimesometrial tissue. In summary, results of this investigation have established that rat decidual tissue synthesizes and selectively secretes proteins, and the specificity and rate of production of these distinct\r"

  ".W": "This study examined changes in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the stalk-median eminence (SME) and posterior pituitary (PP) during the preovulatory PRL surge. Immature female rats were injected with PMSG on day 28. Blood PRL levels were low on the morning of day 30, rose to a peak from 1400-1600 h, remained at a lower plateau from 1800-2400 h, and declined to basal levels on the morning of day 31. SME, PP, and striatum were removed from PMSG-treated rats at selected times during the periovulatory period and from age-matched control rats. TH activity was determined in tissue homogenates by a coupled hydroxylation-decarboxylation assay. Apparent Km and maximum velocity values with respect to 6-methyl tetrahydropterine were estimated from substrate saturation curves. The kinetic parameters for TH in either the SME or the PP of control rats were similar at 1100 and 1800 h on day 30. However, the apparent Km in both tissues was significantly lower than that in the striatum. The affinity of TH in the SME and PP was unchanged before and during the peak phase of the PRL surge, reduced significantly during the late plateau, and returned to presurge levels in the morning of day 31. TH activity in the striatum was similar at all times examined. To determine the state of activation of the enzyme, tissue homogenates were preincubated with cAMP, ATP, and magnesium. TH activity in the SME during the peak phase was unchanged by cAMP, and that in the PP was modestly increased. The relatively inactive enzyme in both tissues during the plateau phase was markedly activated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism. The low affinity of striatal TH was greatly increased by cAMP at both times. These data suggest that TH in the SME and PP exists in an activated state most of the time and is transiently inactivated during the plateau phase of the PRL surge. In contrast, TH in the striatum is relatively inactive in the basal state and is not affected by hormonal changes induced by PMSG. We conclude that the peak PRL surge occurs in spite of active dopamine (DA) neurons, suggesting that it is generated by a nondopaminergic mechanism. Decreased TH activity in DA neurons in the SME and PP may prolong the PRL surge during the plateau phase, whereas increased DA activity coincides with the termination of the surge.\r"

Mammary tissue was collected from intact cyclic animals, on days 35 and 63 of pregnancy, days 5 and 21 of lactation, and day 28 postpartum. Tissue was collected from six cyclic hysterectomized animals. Sections of mammary gland were immunostained with the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method, and antisera to porcine relaxin which were raised to different preparations in different laboratories. Light uniform staining was evident in the cytoplasm of all of the cuboidal epithelial cells forming the mammary duct system in cyclic animals; mammary gland from hysterectomized animals showed similar staining. At midpregnancy light staining was seen in some epithelial cells, and by late pregnancy there was only faint staining. On day 5 of lactation there was intense and uniform staining throughout the epithelial cells of the alveoli. By day 21 of lactation the cells still immunostained for relaxin, but on day 28 postpartum there was a return to the cyclic staining pattern. Endometrium from animals at 55-60 days of pregnancy and mammary gland from day 6 of lactation were used for poly(A)+ RNA isolation and Northern analysis. Three 48-mer oligonucleotide probes were used. Poly(A)+ RNA from endometrium of late pregnant guinea pigs and from the mammary gland in lactation hybridized with the same two probes and failed to hybridize with a third under moderate stringency conditions. The results suggest that the major source of relaxin in the guinea pig is sequential, the pregnant uterus and the lactating mammary gland. The local and/or systemic significance is not known.\r"

In addition, basal and CRF-stimulated mRNA coding for the ACTH precursor were reduced after preincubation with the nitroimidazole derivatives. Miconazole, econazole, isoconazole, clotrimazole, and bifonazole had similar or more pronounced effects on anterior pituitary function compared to ketoconazole, whereas metronidazole and etomidate were less effective. The positive correlation between the number of phenylated side-chains or phenolic rings of the imidazole molecule and the efficacy to inhibit activity on pituitary hormone secretion suggests a structure-activity relationship of these compounds. The effects of the nitroimidazole derivatives on anterior pituitary hormone release and biosynthesis were mediated by cAMP. Thus, basal and CRF-, cholera toxin-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in rat anterior pituitary cell membranes determined by cAMP formation were suppressed by the nitroimidazole derivatives. Pertussis toxin did not diminish the nitroimidazole derivative effect on cAMP formation. The adenylate cyclase inhibitory effect of these substances was independent of the presence of GTP in the assay system, underlining a direct effect on the catalytic subunit. In addition, basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP generation in membranes of S49 lymphoma cyc-variants, which lack a functional Gs protein, was efficiently suppressed (by up to 90%) by the nitroimidazole derivatives. In conclusion, ketoconazole and other nitroimidazole derivatives inhibit anterior pituitary hormone synthesis and secretion apparently by a direct effect on the catalytic subunit of the adenylate cyclase system.\r"

Treatment of adult female monkeys for 11 days with 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MeT) produced dose and time-dependent reductions in SHBG levels. However, the non-steroidal antiandrogen flutamide (80 mg/monkey.day) did not inhibit the reduction in SHBG levels when coadministered with MeT, nor did it have an effect on SHBG levels when given alone. In contrast, the steroidal antiandrogens Win 49596 (100 mg/monkey.day) and cyproterone acetate (80 mg/monkey.day) significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced SHBG plasma concentration to about 50% of pretreatment control values whether given alone or in combination with MeT. Furthermore, Win 49596 reduced SHBG levels at doses as low as 4 mg/monkey, whereas cortico-steroid-binding globulin levels were not affected. In ovariectomized monkeys, MeT treatment (4 mg/monkey.day for 15 days) reduced plasma SHBG levels to 42% of pretreatment values and delayed the onset of withdrawal menstrual bleeding compared to that in controls. When administered concurrently with MeT, flutamide (100 mg/monkey.day) antagonized the effect on withdrawal bleeding, but was without effect on SHBG levels. Therefore, plasma SHBG levels cannot be used as a specific indicator of androgenic or antiandrogenic activity and may not be regulated through the classical androgen receptor.\r"

Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were given verapamil half-way through the 8-week experimental period or during the full 8 weeks of diabetes. Verapamil administration had no effect on the high blood glucose values, low circulating insulin levels, or elevated triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in the diabetic rats. Untreated diabetic rats had a 90% incidence of cataracts. Four weeks of verapamil administration reduced this incidence to 41%, and a full 8 weeks of drug treatment further lowered the incidence to 20%. Diltiazem, another Ca2+ antagonist, lowered the incidence of cataracts in the diabetic rats to a similar extent. Verapamil administration to the diabetic animals also partially protected against the presence of retinal microangiopathy in the diabetic animals. Lenticular hydration and lipid accumulation were only indirectly related to cataractogenesis in the diabetic rats and its protection by verapamil treatment. Lenticular electrolyte imbalance, particularly Ca2+, in the diabetic animals was closely correlated with cataract formation, and verapamil significantly reduced the alterations in these ion concentrations. The present results demonstrate the efficacy of verapamil as a protective agent against cataractogenesis and some retinal damage in diabetic animals. Most importantly, this occurs in the absence of any change in the glycemic status of the diabetic animals. The findings strongly support a role for lenticular Ca2+ imbalance in cataract development in diabetes and provide initial evidence to suggest its clinical use in the diabetic population at risk for blindness.\r"

  ".U": "89325167\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous in vitro study we found that androgens and estradiol (E2) suppress progesterone (P4) production by the granulosa cells isolated from the largest follicle of the domestic hen in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of an aromatase inhibitor did not block the inhibitory action of androgens. The addition of androgen plus E2 to the granulosa cells had an additive effect on suppressing P4 secretion. The aim of this study was to determine the loci in the steroid biosynthetic pathway where androgens and E2 inhibit P4 production by the granulosa cells. Granulosa layers of the largest follicles removed from two or three hens 22 h before ovulation were pooled. Dispersed granulosa cells were incubated for 3 h in triplicate for each treatment, and pregnenolone (P5) and P4 secretion were measured in medium and cells. Experiments were replicated three or four times. Treatment of granulosa cells with cyanoketone (0-100 microM), an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, increased P5 production and decreased P4 production in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal production of P5 and suppression of P4 production at 10 microM cyanoketone. The addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHCh) or P5 (0-16 microM) caused a dose-related increase in basal and LH-stimulated steroid production. The maximal production of P5 or P4 was found at 8 microM 25OHCh or P5. Also, the effect of LH (0-100 ng) on granulosa cell steroidogenesis was examined with or without 8 microM 25OHCh or P5. The half-maximal and maximal doses for P5 or P4 production were 5 and 25 ng LH, respectively. Next, suppression of P5 production by androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and E2 (each at 0-10 microM) was tested in the presence of 25OHCh plus cyanoketone with or without LH. We found a dose-dependent suppression of P5 production by androgens (1-10 microM), but not by E2. However, when we added the above steroids to granulosa cells in the presence of P5 with or without LH, only E2 (1 and 10 microM) caused a significant suppression of P4 production. Our results suggest that 1) androgens primarily act at the conversion site of cholesterol to P5 to suppress P4 production; and 2) E2 acts at the conversion site of P5 to P4 to suppress P4 production. We conclude that production of androgens and E2 by thecal cells may regulate P4 biosynthesis by granulosa cells in the domestic hen.\r"

While free IGF-I had no effect on thymidine incorporation into DNA with BHK-21 cells and only a moderate effect with human fibroblasts under standard conditions, DNA synthesis was significantly enhanced with both cell lines if IGF-I was complexed with SmBP before the experiment. The enhancement was optimal at an approximately equimolar ratio of both peptides. In contrast to experiments in which large concentrations of IGF-I were added at the beginning, repeated addition of small quantities of free IGF-I at hourly intervals clearly stimulated DNA synthesis in BHK-21 cells. Binding studies with radiolabeled SmBP revealed no evidence for direct interaction with either cell line. It is concluded that SmBP acts as a reservoir, releasing continuously low amounts of IGF-I and thereby creating a steady state situation of receptor occupancy, which appears to be a better mitogenic stimulus than temporary large concentrations of IGF-I.\r"

These proteins, therefore, have the potential to bind IGF-I and -II and modify their ability to interact with specific cell surface receptors In these studies we report the detection of high mol wt, multimeric forms of one form of IGF-BP that has been purified from human amniotic fluid. The multimeric forms, which are either not or barely detectable in native amniotic fluid, are the result of intermolecular disulfide bond formation and can be reduced to a monomeric form by exposure to dithiothreitol. After reduction, the multimers are reduced to either monomeric or dimeric forms, as detected by Western blotting. The multimers can be separated from monomeric and dimeric forms by gel filtration chromatography. The purified multimers were fully biologically active in potentiating the effect of IGF-I on porcine aortic smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis. The monomeric form was also bioactive. No significant differences in the affinity of the monomeric and multimeric forms for IGF-I or -II could be detected. In summary, multimeric forms of this form of IGF-BP are detected during purification. The formation of these multimers is through intermolecular disulfide bonds and does not disrupt IGF binding or potentiation of the cellular growth response to IGF-I. These findings indicate that these higher mol wt forms may be fully active in biological test systems.\r"

  ".W": "To facilitate studies of cell growth regulation by T3, we developed a variant GC cell line (V-GC) characterized by normal growth in T3-depleted (-T3) medium. The doubling time (dt) of V-GC cells was 28.8 h (-T3) and 28.0 h (+0.2 nM T3), respectively, whereas the dt of the parent GC cells, 24.0 h (+0.2 nM T3), increased to more than 100 h (-T3). The dt of V-GC cell was unaffected even by maximal T3 (5 nM). Cell protein (micrograms) per microgram DNA increased in GC cells in a T3 concentration-dependent manner, whereas V-GC cell protein was unaffected by T3. GH production appeared partially independent of T3 in V-GC cells. GH production (nanograms per 10(6)/h) in V-GC cells maintained for 3 months in -T3 medium was 3.3- to 4.6-fold greater than that in GC cells after 4 days in -T3 medium (P less than 0.001). Addition of T3 resulted in similar maximal GH production in both cell lines. The binding capacity and Ka of nuclear T3 receptors were similar in GC and V-GC cultures, and receptor down-regulation in response to added T3 occurred similarly in both cultures. Lastly, studies employing conditioned medium indicated that T3-independent growth of V-GC cells did not result from production of an autocrine growth factor. Our findings raise the possibility that overexpression of a transacting cell-specific gene-regulating protein that variably affects thyroid hormone-dependent genes may account for the phenotype of the V-GC cultures.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion were examined in conscious unrestrained rats under both basal and stimulated conditions. Intravenous injection of naloxone in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg did not significantly affect the basal plasma AVP level. However, 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg naloxone significantly raised the basal AVP level in euhydrated rats. Naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) significantly enhanced AVP secretion after 72-h water deprivation. However, the enhancement was more prominent in euhydrated rats than in dehydrated rats. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) also significantly prolonged AVP secretion induced by intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin-II (100 ng). Moreover, naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased AVP secretion induced by intracerebroventricular injection of carbachol (10 ng). Naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) altered neither basal blood pressure nor the angiotensin-II-induced pressor response, but augmented the carbachol-induced pressor response. This suggests that facilitation of AVP secretion by naloxone is not due to a reflex mechanism resulting from decreased blood pressure. These results indicate that endogenous opioid peptides exert a tonic inhibitory control on AVP secretion in rats.\r"

A major peak of immunoactive hamster PL-II with a Mr of 600,000 and a smaller peak (Mr, 210,000) were observed. The major high Mr form of hamster PL-II in plasma had a Mr of 360,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). High Mr forms also predominate in placental extracts, but differ from the plasma forms. 125I-Labeled monomeric hamster PL-II (Mr, 22,000) formed a disulfide-bonded complex (Mr, 720,000 by gel filtration and 360,000 by SDS-PAGE) when incubated in vitro with serum of male, nonpregnant female, or pregnant hamsters. The in vitro complex was also formed with unlabeled hamster PL-II. Similar high Mr complexes were formed, but to a lesser extent, when 125I-labeled mouse PL-II and human PL were incubated with the homologous late pregnant serum. High Mr complexes (Mr, 360,000 by SDS-PAGE) were also formed when the three 125I-labeled PLs were incubated with purified human alpha 2-macroglobulin. The most prominent circulating high Mr form of hamster PL-II had a Mr similar to that of alpha 2-macroglobulin by both gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. In addition, it had a mobility similar to that of alpha 2-macroglobulin on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and it was about 10% asparagine-linked carbohydrate by weight, as is alpha 2-macroglobulin. These similarities and the ability of hamster PL-II to form a disulfide-bonded complex with alpha 2-macroglobulin in vitro suggest that the major circulating form of PL-II in the hamster may be a disulfide-bonded complex of one or more PL monomers with alpha 2-macroglobulin or a related plasma protein. Similar complexed forms of PL may be present in mice and humans.\r"

  ".U": "89325175\r", 
  ".W": "The concentrations of type I and type II adrenocorticosteroid receptors in brain cytosol obtained from adrenalectomized-ovariectomized female mice were measured with five different assay conditions. Among the five brain regions studied, hippocampus had the highest concentration of type I receptors, whereas cerebral cortex had the highest concentration of type II receptors. The value of properly correcting for dexamethasone cross-binding to type I receptors when type II receptors are being assayed was demonstrated using the type II receptor-selective ligand RU28362. A time-course study revealed a transient up-regulation of both receptor classes in most brain regions after adrenalectomy-ovariectomy, with maximal values achieved 3-5 days postsurgery and a reduction to near-intact levels by 16 days postsurgery. A single sc injection of aldosterone given to adrenalectomized-ovariectomized mice produced a profound down-regulation of type I receptors in hippocampal, cerebral cortex, hypothalamic, brain stem, and cerebellar samples, whereas it down-regulated type II receptors only in hippocampal and cerebral cortical samples. A similar injection of RU28362 failed to down-regulate type I receptors in any brain region, but it did reduce the concentration of type II receptors in all brain regions except cerebellum. The actions of aldosterone appear to be mediated solely through type I receptors, since injections of the type I receptor antagonist RU26752 prevented aldosterone-induced down-regulation of both type I and type II receptors, whereas RU26752 had no effect on the down-regulatory actions of RU28362. The ability of aldosterone to down-regulate type I, but not type II, receptors in hypothalamic, brain stem, and cerebellar samples suggests that type I and type II receptors are concentrated in separate populations of cells in these brain regions, whereas in hippocampus and cerebral cortex there is a sufficient degree of colocalization to permit type II receptor down-regulation via the action of aldosterone-type I receptor complexes. We speculate that this action is mediated at least in part at the genomic level by the suppression of type I and type II receptor mRNA synthesis brought about by the interactions of transformed aldosterone-type I receptor complexes with the DNA regulatory elements upstream from the genes for these receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol (E2) replacement therapy effectively prevents or delays postmenopausal bone loss, but the mode of E2 action on bone is still unknown. Recently, the presence of E2 receptors was described for bone-derived cells. In this study we examined the estrogen responsiveness of osteoblastic cells using the experimentally immortalized calvarial cell lines RCT-1 and RCT-3 as well as primary cultures of calvarial and trabecular bone cells. E2 treatment reduced PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 20-30% in RCT cells; the maximum effect was observed after treatment with 1 nM E2 for 4 h or longer. In trabecular cells E2 decreased PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 60-80%. After a lag period of at least 48 h, E2 treatment (0.01-10 nM) increased cell number and [3H]thymidine incorporation in both RCT-3 cells and primary cultures of trabecular cells to 20-60% above control values. Half-maximal effects were observed at about 1 nM E2. Antibodies against insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) inhibited the E2-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting basal growth. Furthermore, E2 treatment increased the steady state levels of IGF-I mRNA 2- to 2.5-fold in calvarial and RCT-3 cells compared to control levels. In addition, E2 (10 nM) increased the level of collagen mRNA more than 2-fold and opposed the suppression of collagen mRNA produced by PTH treatment. The E2 effects were specific to 17 beta-E2, since they were not observed with the biologically less active stereoisomer 17 alpha-E2 and were blocked by the E2 antagonist tamoxifen (1 microM). Thus, for osteoblastic cells in culture, E2 can directly stimulate proliferation as well as collagen and IGF-I mRNA while decreasing PTH responsiveness; these effects could explain the anabolic and anticatabolic effects of E2 on bone.\r"

The causative agent, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy factor [also called PTH-related protein (PTHrp)] has been shown to interact with PTH receptors in bone and kidney. We compared human PTHrp-(1-34) with rat PTH-(1-34) for the effects of each peptide on cardiovascular function in unrestrained conscious rats. Both PTHrp and PTH decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range of 0.3-30 micrograms/kg. PTHrp was approximately 3-fold more potent than PTH, producing up to a 50 mm Hg decrease in pressure within 2 min at 10 micrograms/kg. Both peptides increased heart rate more than 70 beats/min at this dose. However, PTH appeared to exert greater efficacy and potency than PTHrp in increasing heart rate in vivo. In the isolated and perfused rat heart, PTHrp and PTH produced positive chronotropic and positive inotropic effects as well as increased coronary flow. PTHrp was more potent and more effective than PTH. The time courses of these effects in the perfused heart preparations indicated that both peptides produced maximal effects within 1 min, with all responses returning to baseline within 10 min. In isolated helical strips of rat aorta, PTHrp and PTH relaxed norepinephrine-contracted tissues in a concentration-dependent fashion. A functional endothelium was not required for the relaxing effects of either peptide. These studies indicate that PTHrp and PTH decrease blood pressure by relaxing vascular tissue in an endothelium-independent manner. Also, these peptides directly increased heart rate, contractility, and coronary flow. Since PTHrp has recently been found in normal human cells, these studies suggest the possibility of PTHrp as a regulator or modulator of cardiovascular function.\r"

In addition, the initial effect of TH on Na-K pump synthesis has been shown to be TTX dependent. Accordingly, we have studied effects of TH on expression of TTX-sensitive Na channels in cultured skeletal muscle. Expression of Na channels was determined by measurements of the binding of [3H]saxitoxin (STX). The frequency and rate of rise of spontaneously occurring action potentials, which are related to the density of TTX-sensitive Na channels, were also determined. TH caused dose-dependent increases in Na channels as well as in action potential frequency and rate of rise. The increases were detectable as early as 12 h after treatment with TH was begun, and levels reached a maximum plateau after 36-48 h. The effects of TH were blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Scatchard analysis showed the channels in TH-treated myotubes to have lower affinity for STX than those in control cells. The effect of TH to up-regulate Na channels was reduced by growth of the cells in elevated external calcium. In contrast, treatment with TTX or verapamil, which lower cytosolic Ca2+, resulted in a marked increase in the effect of TH over that in control myotubes. Thus, TH appears to regulate Na channels in cultured myotubes by two opposing mechanisms; 1) direct stimulation of Na channel synthesis, and 2) indirect decrease in synthesis mediated by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. The results indicate that TH may play an important role in developmental expression of Na channels in excitable tissue.\r"

Cells were prepared from the fourth series of tumors under serum-free medium conditions that prevent fibroblast growth. Subcloning of these cells yielded several propagatable clonal cell lines. One cell line with immunoreactive CCK-8 production was selected for further studies. This high CCK cell line, WE4/2, produces and secretes a CCK-immunoreactive product that coelutes with synthetic CCK-8 sulfate during Sephadex chromatography and HPLC. Northern analysis with a rat CCK cDNA revealed that the cultured cells produce a CCK RNA the same size and with the same 5' end as that previously reported for brain and intestines. In addition, a recombinant plasmid containing about 800 basepairs of 5' flanking sequence of the rat CCK gene linked to the coding sequence of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene elicited a high level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity when transfected into the WE4/2 cell line. Therefore, the WE4/2 cell line provides a model system for studying CCK gene expression and biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that several forms of cytochrome P-450 present in rat liver microsomes oxidize testosterone with a high degree of regio- and stereospecificity. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathways of testosterone oxidation catalyzed by rat extrahepatic microsomes. Lung, kidney, testis, prostate, and brain were isolated from 3- and 14-week-old-male Sprague-Dawley rats. Microsomes from lung, kidney, and testis catalyzed distinctly different pathways of testosterone oxidation, whereas microsomes from prostate and brain failed to hydroxylate testosterone directly in a time- and protein-dependent manner. Lung microsomes from immature and mature rats converted testosterone to 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, 16 beta-hydroxytestosterone, and androstenedione. Lung microsomes were shown by Western immunoblot to contain cytochrome P-450b (P450IIB1), which has been shown previously to catalyze these three pathways of testosterone oxidation. Antibody against cytochrome P-450b strongly inhibited (greater than 80%) androstenedione formation and completely inhibited (greater than 95%) the 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone catalyzed by lung microsomes (as did carbon monoxide and antibody against NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase). Kidney microsomes from mature male rats converted testosterone to 2 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, and androstenedione, whereas only the latter pathway was catalyzed by kidney microsomes from immature rats. Kidney microsomes from mature male rats were shown by Western immunoblot to contain cytochrome P-450h (P450IIC11), which has been shown previously to convert testosterone to 2 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, and androstenedione. Antibody against cytochrome P-450h completely inhibited (greater than 95%) the 2 alpha- and 16 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone by kidney microsomes, but had little effect on androstenedione formation, which is catalyzed by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Testicular microsomes from mature, but not immature, rats catalyzed the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone. Previous studies have shown that this reaction is catalyzed in liver microsomes by cytochrome P-450a (P450IIA1). Testicular microsomes from mature, but not immature, rats were shown by Western immunoblot to contain cytochrome P-450a. Antibody against cytochrome P-450a or NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase completely inhibited (greater than 95%) the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone by testicular microsomes.

  ".W": "The binding of [125I]insulin-like growth factor-I ([125I]IGF-I) to human skin fibroblasts (HSF) is regulated by multiple factors. In monolayers of HSF, IGF-I binds to both the type I IGF receptor and IGF-binding proteins (BPs) associated with the cell surface. [125I]IGF-I binding to both of these proteins depends markedly on the sodium chloride concentration of the binding buffer. In monolayers of HSF, replacing 120 mM NaCl with isoosmotic concentrations of sucrose increases binding of [125I]IGF-I by 2- to 6-fold. Enhancement of [125I]IGF-I binding in the absence of sodium chloride is also seen in HSF in suspension, in human erythrocytes, in monolayers of HEP G2 cells and FRTL5 cells, and in membranes prepared from human placentae. Kinetic analysis of [125I]IGF-I binding to HSF monolayers reveals that association rates are increased and dissociation rates are decreased in the absence of sodium chloride. The binding of [125I]alpha IR-3, a monoclonal antibody to the human type I IGF receptor, to monolayers and suspensions of HSF also depends on the sodium ion concentration; it is 5- to 7-fold higher in the absence of sodium chloride. Binding of [125I]IGF-I to monolayers of HSF also depends on NaCl under conditions where alpha IR-3 saturates the type I IGF receptor but does not affect IGF-BPs. These findings demonstrate that sodium chloride has a marked effect on the interaction of IGF-I with the type I IGF receptor in the plasma membrane and with BPs associated with the surface of intact HSFs. Since an effect is also evident in membranes prepared from intact tissues (human placenta), occurs at 4 C, and occurs with cells devoid of BPs, a mechanism involving receptor or BP translocation seems unlikely, at least as the sole explanation for these findings. Sodium ions (and other ions) may induce a conformational change in the receptor and BPs and cause decreased availability of both the IGF-I-binding site and the alpha IR-3 epitope on the receptor and the IGF-binding site on the BP.\r"

  ".W": "The bovine fetal placenta expresses a family of PRL-related genes, consisting of the gene encoding bovine placental lactogen (bPL), and a diverse group of related genes, exemplified by bovine PRL-related cDNA I (bPRCI). bPL and the protein encoded by bPRCI are quite distinct from one another, predicting proteins only about 36% similar in amino acid sequence. To identify the cells responsible for the expression of bPL and bPRCI, in situ hybridization experiments were performed. 35S-Labeled RNA probes were prepared from the 3' regions of bPL and bPRCI and allowed to hybridize to frozen sections of bovine placentomes. Transcripts corresponding to bPL and bPRCI colocalized to fetal binucleate cells, which is consistent with the immunocytochemical localization of bPL. Signal from radiolabeled antisense strand probe was blocked by pretreatment of the sections with a 150-fold excess of unlabeled probe, but not by an excess of unlabeled probe prepared using the other cDNA as a template. This demonstrated that the signals observed were specific for bPL and bPRCI and that the two probes did not cross-hybridize at the stringency of our conditions. Radiolabeled sense strand probes yielded no signal. We conclude that the binucleate cells of the bovine placenta transcribe at least two members of the PRL gene family that may influence fetal development and maternal adaptation to pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes is associated with a decrease in glucose uptake into muscle, the primary tissue responsible for whole body glucose uptake in the fed state. To study the basis of such a decrease we estimated the number of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle membranes from control and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats. Animals were injected with 65 mg STZ/kg and were clearly diabetic (hyperglycemic and glycosuric) at 1 week. After an overnight fast, animals were killed, and skeletal muscle from hind limbs were removed and used to prepare plasma membranes and internal membranes. The number of glucose transporters was determined by D-glucose-protectable equilibrium binding of [3H]cytochalasin-B. STZ-treated rats showed a 37% decrease in the number of glucose transporters per mg protein in crude membranes. The decrease was more pronounced in plasma membranes (average 50% decrease) than in the intracellular membranes (32% decrease). The reduction in the number of glucose transporters was specific, since it was not paralleled by changes in other plasma membrane markers or in total protein, although plasma membrane protein decreased by 15% in STZ-treated rats. When total recoveries of transporters were calculated (i.e. picomoles of transporters recovered per g tissue), the number of transporters in the plasma membrane fraction from STZ-treated rats was decreased by 68% relative to that in control animals. In the intracellular membranes and in total crude membranes from diabetic rats the transporters were decreased by 45%. This suggests that in STZ-treated rats there is an overall decrease in the number of glucose transporters, and that the plasma membrane is further specifically depleted of transporters. The decrease in glucose transporter number in the plasma membrane could at least in part be the cause of the diminished glucose uptake in diabetic muscle and for overall drop in total body glucose utilization of this condition.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acid sequences of human inhibin alpha-, beta A- and beta B-subunits were analyzed for hydrophilicity and chain flexibility to predict regions that are on the surface of the subunits and, therefore, are potential antigenic sites. Based on these analyses, a total of nine peptides were synthesized, and rabbit antisera against the peptides were prepared. Peptides of the N-terminus (residues 1-16 and 13-24) and region 109-123 of the alpha-subunit produced high titer antibodies. Regions 69-79 and 93-105 of the beta A-subunit and region 93-104 of the beta B-subunit were also immunogenic. Immunoblotting of an inhibin preparation with anti-alpha-peptide antiserum revealed that a 32K band (inhibin) and an 18K band (alpha-subunit) were stained. Immunoblotting with anti-beta-peptide antiserum detected a 32K band (inhibin), a 24K band (activin), and a 14K band (beta-subunit). Injection (iv) of these antisera into rats induced dramatic elevation of serum FSH in 6-12 h and suggested immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin. RIAs for each subunit were developed using radioiodinated peptides as tracers. Competition binding assays indicated crossreactivity with human follicular fluid, semen, serum, plasma, and crude inhibin preparations. Parallel dilution curves were obtained. Antisera against beta A- and beta B-subunit peptide cross-reacted with each other. In immunocytochemical studies, these antisera were used in conjunction with gold-labeled goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G to localize inhibin in cells of the rat testis. Specific staining of inhibin was localized within the Sertoli cells of some tubules in adult rat testis. Positive staining could be blocked by preadsorbing the sera with the appropriate synthetic peptide. These results suggest that antibodies against synthetic inhibin peptides are useful in elucidating the roles of inhibin and activin.\r"

  ".W": "To further examine whether nongonadal restraint of gonadotropin secretion during prepubertal development plays a major role in the timing of puberty in the guinea pig, as it does in the monkey and other primates, two experiments were performed. In the first, neonatal male and female guinea pigs were either bilaterally gonadectomized or sham gonadectomized on day 2 of age, or left intact. Circulating LH concentrations were measured in blood samples collected by cardiac puncture every 4 days beginning on day 2 of age and continuing until the animals were 98 days of age. In the second experiment, the time course of the LH response to ovariectomy was examined in juvenile female guinea pigs that were castrated on day 10 of age and were either isolated from or allowed to remain with their mothers for the duration of the study. To place into perspective the time course of the LH response to prepubertal gonadectomy, the effect of castration on LH secretion in adult animals was also examined. Serum LH concentrations were determined by a RIA that employed GDN-15 as the first antibody. Orchidectomy on day 2 of age resulted in an immediate and progressive rise in serum LH concentrations, which plateaued by 30 days of age at levels indistinguishable from those of adult castrates. In contrast, ovariectomy on day 2 of age failed to elicit an immediate rise in serum LH. Instead, circulating LH concentrations in neonatally castrated female guinea pigs were not significantly different from those in intact controls until day 14 of age, at which time serum LH rose progressively to plateau by 30 days of age at levels comparable to those in adult castrates. The time courses of LH secretion after ovariectomy of 10-day-old guinea pigs that were either isolated from or allowed to remain with their mothers were not significantly different and were similar to that observed after ovariectomy at 2 days of age. For reasons presented in detail in Discussion, the foregoing findings fail to support the view that nongonadal restraint of gonadotropin secretion during prepubertal development plays a major role in the timing of sexual maturation in the guinea pig. This laboratory rodent, therefore, may be viewed as a poor paradigm for study of the neuroendocrine basis of puberty in primates.\r"

The converse could also exist, that is communication from the immune cells to GH-producing somatotrophs. To test this hypothesis, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a product of activated macrophages, was exposed to cultured rat pituitary cells, and GH release was monitored. TNF alpha inhibited basal and GH-releasing hormone-stimulated GH accumulation, with IC50 values of 170 U/ml (5.2 ng/ml) and 50 U/ml (1.5 ng/ml), respectively. This inhibition was first measured after 6 h of TNF alpha treatment, continued for at least 3 days, and was reversible. A number of measurements (e.g. trypan blue exclusion, chromium release, and GH cell content) yielded no signs of cytotoxicity to explain the inhibition. We conclude that TNF alpha can reduce basal and stimulated pituitary GH release in vitro.\r"

Although detectable at 1 day of age, significant concentrations of AEG were not measured until 20 days; concentrations increased steadily, so that by 120 days of age, AEG represented 10% of total soluble protein. AEG mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis of RNA from epididymides of 5-day-old animals and rapidly increased in amount between 20 and 35 days, reaching a maximum at 45 days. Using immunohistochemistry, AEG was localized in epididymal epithelial cells at 1 day of age. The number of cells staining for AEG increased markedly after 15 days. At 120 days, the immunoreactivity was predominantly localized to the lumen of the epithelial duct. To delineate factors that may influence AEG expression in the developing epididymis, we measured concentrations of androgen and androgen receptor mRNA in tissue extracts prepared from animals of various ages. Androgen receptor mRNA was detectable in epididymal extracts isolated from 1- to 90-day-old animals. Epididymal androgen concentrations were high at all ages (range, 6.0-31.2 ng/g tissue). The marked increase in AEG mRNA concentration at 20 days of age was not associated with an increase in either androgen or androgen receptor mRNA concentrations, suggesting that other factors may be necessary for AEG expression.\r"

  ".U": "89325193\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that somatostatin receptors on AtT-20 and GH3 pituitary tumor cells show relative preference for binding somatostatin-28 (S-28) and somatostatin-14 (S-14), respectively. Here we have attempted to determine whether this selectivity can be explained by molecular heterogeneity of the receptor. Cells were incubated with [125I-Tyr11]S-14, [125I-Leu8-D-Trp22,Tyr25]S-28, and [125I-Tyr3]SMS, and the bound ligand was chemically cross-linked with bis-[2-succinimido-oxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone, disuccinimidyl suberate, or dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate). The solubilized cross-linked material was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. [125I-Tyr11]S-14 labeled three specific receptor proteins of 57K, 42K, and 27K mol wt in AtT-20 cells. The relative proportions of the protein bands were unaltered by the use of whole cells or cell membranes or by the inclusion of dithiothreitol or antiproteolytic agents. With both [125I-Tyr11]S-14 and [125I-LTT]S-28, the 57K protein constituted the major labeled component, representing 70-75% of the total cross-linked proteins. Labeling of the three protein species by [125I-Tyr11]S-14 and [125I-LTT]S-28 was inhibited by both S-14 and S-28 in a dose-dependent manner. S-28 was 10-20 times more potent than S-14 for inhibiting the labeling by both ligands of the principal receptor species of 57K. By contrast, when a radioiodinated derivative of the octapeptide analog octreotide ([125I-Tyr3]SMS) was used as ligand, the 27K protein was preferentially labeled, whereas the 57K and 42K bands were detected only as minor components. Labeling of GH3 cells with [125I-Tyr11]S-14 and [125I-LTT]S-28 revealed three cross-linked proteins of 57K, 42K, and 27K mol wt similar to those observed in AtT-20 cells. However, in this cell line the 27K protein, not the 57K species, was the dominant component identified with these two ligands, comprising 40-50% of the total cross-linked proteins. These results suggest that there are three somatostatin receptor proteins of 57K, 42K, and 27K in pituitary cells. In AtT-20 cells, the 57K protein constitutes the major receptor protein labeled by [125I-Tyr11]S-14 and [125I-LTT]S-28, whereas the 27K protein is the major species labeled by [125I-Tyr3]SMS. The 27K, not the 57K, moiety is the principal receptor form in GH3 cells. Such ligand- and tissue-selective binding by the somatostatin receptor provides strong evidence for receptor molecular heterogeneity.\r"

GH and PRL gene expressions were studied in the pituitary gland of this animal. Immunocytochemistry failed to detect any immunoreactive GH cells in SDR pituitary gland, whereas numerous PRL cells were encountered throughout the anterior lobe. Similarly, GH was not detectable in the pituitary cytosol from SDR of 7, 20, and 80 days of age. PRL of the same mol wt as the authentic rat PRL was found in the pituitary glands in all SDRs examined. Since these results were thought to be due to the absence of GH mRNA in the SDR's pituitary gland, we attempted to detect GH mRNA by dot hybridization. Very small amounts of GH mRNA were found in the pituitary glands of both male (2.6% of normal) and female (6.0% of normal) SDRs. Reduced levels of PRL mRNA were also found in the pituitary glands of male (50%) and female (30%) SDRs. Northern blot analyses of total RNA extracts revealed that the GH mRNA of the SDR was similar in size to the mature GH mRNA found in the pituitary glands of control rats. PRL mRNA from the SDR also migrated to the same position as normal PRL mRNA. Nuclear DNA preparations were prepared from normal and SDR livers, and the genomic organizations of the GH and PRL genes were examined using restriction mapping. The DNA fragment length patterns obtained with the cDNA probes for GH or PRL using several restriction enzyme digestions were identical. The results suggest that the GH deficiency in SDR is not due to a gross deletion or rearrangement of the GH gene. It is proposed that SDR may be an excellent experimental model for the study of isolated GH deficiency in the human.\r"

Blood CBG levels (as measured by [3H] cortisol binding) averaged 11-fold greater for decidualized hamsters than for sham-operated controls on day 8 of pseudopregnancy (PSP). We used sequential blood sampling from individual hamsters to monitor changes in CBG content after decidualization. The increase in blood CBG after decidualization was rapid, as evidenced by a significant difference in CBG content between sham-operated and decidualized groups within 24 h after surgery. We varied the extent of uterine traumatization to induce differing amounts of decidual tissue. Regardless of the amount of decidual tissue, all decidualized hamsters showed a significant increase in blood CBG; however, there was a dose-dependent relationship between the amount of decidual tissue formed and the magnitude of the CBG response. We used hysterectomy (on PSP day 6, after decidualization on PSP day 4) to determine if removal of the decidualized uterus influenced the duration of the CBG response. Bilateral hysterectomy blocked further increases in blood CBG, whereas in control animals (unilateral hysterectomy) blood CBG continued to increase after surgery. Thus, once the CBG response is initiated, the decidualized uterus is necessary to maintain elevated CBG levels. The findings in this study provide further evidence for the presence of a decidua-hepatic endocrine axis that appears to be responsible for elevation of circulating CBG levels during early pregnancy in the hamster.\r"

Between 0.01-1.0 mM, NaI produced a dose-dependent inhibition of TSH stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation and replication in FRTL5 cells as well as spontaneous growth in M12 cells. Iodide also inhibited the cAMP-dependent growth of FRTL5 cells induced by forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP, as well as the cAMP-independent mitogenesis induced by insulin-like growth factor-I. The effect of iodide to inhibit both TSH- and insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated growth in FRTL5 cells was abolished by concomitant culture with methimazole, and no iodide inhibition of growth was observed in L6 myoblasts and BRL 30E hepatocytes. Exposure of cells to iodide under conditions that resulted in inhibition of TSH-stimulated growth did not significantly alter the ability of TSH to increase the intracellular cAMP concentration, nor did iodide alter two responses to TSH in FRTL5 cells that depend upon an increase in cAMP concentration: down-regulation of TSH receptor and cytoskeletal reorganization. We conclude that iodide exerts its inhibitory action on the growth of thyroid cells at multiple loci related to both the cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways of mitogenic regulation.\r"

  ".W": "A soluble GH-binding protein, which cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) to the rabbit liver membrane GH receptor, has been identified in cytosol preparations from both fetal and maternal portions of rabbit placenta. Structural studies using gel filtration chromatography and chemical covalent cross-linking techniques have shown that the GH-binding protein in fetal/maternal placental cytosol has a native mol wt of 104,000 and a denatured subunit of about 57,000 mol wt (with or without dithiothreitol). Very low levels of GH-specific [125I]human (h) GH binding were observed in membrane preparations from the corresponding placentae, even after desaturation of any endogenously bound hormone by 5 M MgCl2. No PRL-specific binding was observed in placental membranes or cytosols. Scatchard analysis of [125I]hGH binding to fetal and maternal placental cytosol revealed linear plots with Ka values of 6.1 +/- 1.1 nM-1 (fetal) and 5.31 +/- 0.63 nM-1 (maternal; mean +/- SEM; n = 5). The binding capacity of maternal placental cytosol, when expressed as femtomoles per mg protein (170 +/- 10.10) or femtomoles per g tissue (3245 +/- 123), was about 3-fold higher than that for fetal placental cytosol. Northern blot analysis of fetal and maternal placental mRNA probed with a GH receptor oligonucleotide probe revealed hybridization to a 4.4 to 4.7-kilobase and a 2.2-kilobase species in fetal placenta only. The level of GH-specific binding observed in fetal and maternal placental cytosol did not correlate directly with the level of mRNA expression. A GH-binding protein has also been shown to be present in fetal rabbit serum and is known to be structurally and immunologically related to the rabbit placental and liver cytosolic GH-binding proteins. Scatchard analysis of [125I]hGH binding to fetal serum GH-binding protein revealed a single class of high affinity sites with a Ka of 4.64 +/- 1.29 nM-1 and a capacity of 338 +/- 167 fmol/ml serum (mean +/- SEM; n = 4). Given the relative binding capacities and the demonstration of GH receptor mRNA in fetal placental cytosol, it is highly unlikely that contamination of fetal placental cytosol by fetal serum accounts for all of the placental binding capacity observed. However, no such definitive conclusion regarding contamination by maternal rabbit serum of maternal placental cytosol can be made. The presence of GH-binding proteins in placental cytosol has not been described previously, and these observations suggest that GH may have a role in placental metabolism.\r"

To help distinguish \"motor\" effects from these more complex \"cognitive\" effects, neuropsychological data on 70 adult PHT monotherapy patients were reanalyzed. Initially, a series of statistically significant differences favored the low serum level group over the high serum level group in neuropsychologic performance. However, when a simple measure of motor speed (Finger Tapping Test) was covaried out, all statistically significant differences between the groups disappeared. Thus, losses in cognitive abilities could not be associated with PHT even though markedly elevated blood levels had been achieved.\r"

  ".W": "We report the results of treatment of refractory generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus in 17 adults. Of 13 patients who received high-dose phenytoin (PHT, mean dose 23.8 mg/kg), seizure control was sustained in five patients. In 12 cases, anesthetic doses of pentobarbital rapidly suppressed convulsions, but sustained control required prolonged treatment. Break-through seizures were, in most cases, explained by inadequate serum pentobarbital concentrations, although we could not establish a therapeutic range of serum concentrations. EEG monitoring is necessary to assess the therapeutic response but is not a reliable index of depth of anesthesia. Some cases developed pharmacodynamic tolerance to pentobarbital. The most serious treatment complications were cardiorespiratory, but the most common and disabling side effects, although reversible, were neurologic. Fifteen patients were discharged from the hospital in stable condition; two patients died, but not as a direct consequence of treatment. Our results suggest a very good outcome of pentobarbital anesthesia for patients in refractory status epilepticus who are a reasonable medical risk and who receive optimal medical management.\r"

This study examined the intraosseous (i.o.) route as an alternative means of vascular access for drug administration in an animal-seizure model. Domestic swine (13-20 kg) were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg i.m.) and alpha-chloralose (80 mg/kg i.v.) and given gallamine (4 mg/kg i.v.) to prevent muscle fasciculations. Tracheosotomies were performed and the animals were ventilated with a Harvard respirator. The left femoral vein was cannulated and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (100 mg/kg) was given to elicit epileptogenic activity. Sixty seconds after onset of epileptogenic activity, the animals received saline or diazepam (DZP) (0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) i.v. or via the i.o. route (18-gauge spinal needle placed in the right proximal tibia). Both DZP and propranolol were effective in suppressing epileptogenic activity via the i.v. or i.o. routes. Thus, the i.o. route is a rapid and effective alternative route for the administration of antiepileptic drugs when an i.v. route cannot be readily established.\r"

This study examined the efficacy of i.o. lorazepam (LZP) in suppressing pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure activity in pigs. Domestic swine (13-20 kg) were prepared for recordings of arterial blood pressure, EEG, and electrocortical activity. Seizure activity was induced by PTZ (100 mg/kg i.v.). Sixty seconds after onset of seizure activity, animals either received no drug (control) or LZP (1.0 mg/kg) administered i.v. or i.o. via an 18- or 13-gauge spinal needle inserted in the right proximal tibia. Both i.o. and i.v. LZP significantly suppressed the duration of seizure activity (DSA) (s/min interval) within 1 min following drug administration: DSA control, 46.2 +/- 3.6; i.v. LZP, 25.0 +/- 5.1; i.o. (18-gauge) LZP, 27.6 +/- 6.0; i.o. (13-gauge) LZP, 24.0 +/- 2.4. Seizure activity was essentially abolished at 1 min following LZP infusion. In addition, both i.v. and i.o. LZP did not have significant effects on the basal heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. The data demonstrate that in swine (1) the i.o. route is an effective alternative venous access for LZP administration, and (2) the size of spinal needles does not affect the antiepileptic efficacy of i.o. infusion of LZP.\r"

  ".W": "This study better defines the way in which the thalamus controls expression of experimental generalized seizures. The effects of small intrathalamic injections of the direct GABA agonist muscimol on the thresholds of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures and on spontaneous behavior were determined in the rat and compared with the effects of injections of gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG), an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase. Muscimol injections produced neuronal inhibition in a relatively small area of thalamus, whereas GVG injections produced inhibition in a much larger area. Muscimol injections in the midline thalamus in the vicinity of the paraventricular, paratenial, interanteromedial, intermediodorsal, and central medial nuclei facilitated PTZ myoclonic and clonic seizures and also produced sedation. These effects on seizure thresholds were attributable both to a lower PTZ threshold dose for initiation of electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity and to an increased probability of this EEG activity being expressed as behavioral seizures. Midline injections located more posteriorly in the thalamus also inhibited tonic seizures. Muscimol injections placed laterally, dorsally, or ventrally to this midline thalamic region had much less effect on behavior or seizures. In contrast, GVG injections in the anterior medial thalamus elevated the threshold for all PTZ seizure types and for associated EEG seizure activity but had little effect on spontaneous behavior. These findings demonstrate the existence of an important seizure regulatory system in the midline of the thalamus and a direct anatomic link between the mechanisms for regulating arousal and seizure production which may help explain the association between sleep and seizure facilitation in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bicuculline was able to elicit both minimal (clonic) and major (tonic-clonic) seizures in all age groups, but in 7-day-old rats minimal seizures were only noted exceptionally. CD50s (for major seizures) ranged from 2.48 to 2.85 mg/kg in the three younger groups and increased to approximately 7 mg/kg in 25- and 90-day-old rats. An intravenous (i.v.) administration of bicuculline in 67 rats, 18 and 25 days old, caused identical CD50s in these groups, indicating that the difference that occurs with an i.p. administration is due to pharmacokinetic reasons. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) studies in acute experiments as well as in young rats with implanted electrodes demonstrated general principles of the development of EEG: an increase in frequency of individual elements, in generalization of the epileptic activity, in synchronization of activity among various cortical regions, and in the correlation between ECoG and motor phenomena. An exception occurred as an age-related phenomenon: rhythmic activity of the spike-and-wave type. This activity appeared in 18-day-old and older rats and was invariably accompanied by \"freezing\" of the animals.\r"

After excluding initially abnormal cases: (1) cauterization women were bleeding more heavily than all other groups excepting Pomeroy; (2) cauterization and Pomeroy women experienced more dysmenorrhea than women not planning sterilization; and (3) more cauterization and Pomeroy women (collapsed samples) developed abnormal length cycles than did the two control groups. There were no group differences regarding development of beneficial/neutral change (e.g., decreased dysmenorrhea). However, cauterization and Pomeroy groups experienced a significantly higher average number of adverse changes than did the other groups and were at significantly greater risk of developing one or more adverse changes than were women not planning sterilization. The only pattern of association among adverse menstrual changes occurred significantly more often in the cauterization and next in the Pomeroy groups.\r"

Patients with polycystic ovaries and hyperplastic stromal abnormalities had most spontaneous conceptions and a normal fertility during follow-up. Apparently, chronic anovulation in these cases had been caused by ovarian disease in the face of normal hypothalamic function. Patients with polycystic ovaries without stromal abnormalities often needed postoperative stimulation of ovulation in order to conceive, which may indicate hypothalamic involvement. Patients with large ovaries, normal stroma, and small follicles, who as a group had the lowest serum levels of luteinizing hormone, and patients whose ovaries contained large follicles and cysts without theca cell activity did not benefit from the bilateral ovarian wedge resection. Generally, their postoperative response to medical induction of ovulation did not improve either. Measures to prevent adhesions were not completely successful. Nevertheless, our results suggest that anovulation rather than formation of adhesions causes persistent infertility after bilateral ovarian wedge resection.\r"

Previously untreated women had significantly (P less than 0.001) lower values than a group of age-matched healthy controls, while the difference between those women having received estrogen therapy and the same controls was not significant. Sixteen patients were restudied after 6 to 21 months of estrogen therapy, part of a regimen intended to prepare the endometrium for oocyte donation, and vertebral bone mineral density increased in 12 of them.

The pregnancy rate was 23% per retrieval, 27% per ET, and 49% per patient. There were 77 (31%) spontaneous abortions and five (2%) ectopic pregnancies. Linear regression analysis of the effect of women's age on the ongoing pregnancy rate per ET showed a highly significant negative linear correlation between age and ongoing pregnancy rate (P less than 0.005). Ongoing pregnancy rate per ET for patients younger than 30 years of age was 26%, as compared with 9% for patients aged 37 years (P less than 0.01). Patients aged 40 years or greater had a 50% miscarriage rate, compared with 29% in patients under the age of 40 (P greater than 0.05). The clinical pregnancy rate per ET for patients undergoing one to seven attempts was 25%, 29%, 28%, 33%, 35%, 30%, and two out of five, respectively.

Oocytes that failed to fertilize in vitro were inseminated with a mixture of equal numbers of test and fertile donor sperm differentially labeled with fluorescein or rhodamine to control for variability in the sperm-zona pellucida binding capacity of oocytes. The ratio of the number of test and control sperm bound to four to six zonae pellucidae was significantly correlated with sperm morphology, viability, motility, motility index, and normal intact acrosomes in semen. The sperm-zona pellucida binding ratio was the most significant factor related to IVF rates by logistic regression analysis. But the proportions of sperm with normal morphology and intact acrosomes in semen also were significant. In patients with less than 30% of sperm with normal morphology, there was a highly significant relationship between IVF rate and sperm-zona pellucida binding and a weaker relationship with sperm morphology. In conclusion, the sperm-zona pellucida binding ratio test is useful for predicting sperm fertilizing ability in vitro, particularly in men with poor sperm morphology.\r"

Pregnancy occurred in 42 cycles, resulting in an overall pregnancy rate of 17.7%, and a cycle fecundity of 9.3%. Cycle fecundity was positively correlated with the parameters of post-swim-up log sperm density (r = 0.994), and with log total motile sperm inseminated (r = 0.964; inseminates were limited to a maximum of 20 million total motile sperm). Post-swim-up motility did not correlate (r = 0.308) with cycle fecundity; however, most specimens had a motility of greater than 40% post-swim-up. Only one pregnancy occurred when less than 1 million motile sperm were inseminated (38 cycles), which resulted in a cycle fecundity of 2.6% for these cycles. This may represent the threshold of effectiveness for IUI in this setting. Highest cycle fecundity was obtained with an inseminate containing approximately 10 million or more motile sperm. Parameters of raw samples correlated less well with cycle fecundity than did prepared specimens. Analysis of post-swim-up semen parameters can provide useful prognostic information for women undergoing IUI with ovarian stimulation; this information is helpful in counseling patients regarding their chances of success with this therapy.\r"

The bilateral intrascrotal temperatures were recorded in the supine position and then monitored continuously in the standing position. The maximum temperatures in both positions were compared between each group. The mean temperature of the varicocele group was higher than that of the other two groups in the standing position. The authors studied the difference in temperature (delta T) due to postural change from supine to standing. The mean delta T of the left testis was +0.78 degrees C in the varicocele group, whereas it was approximately -0.5 degrees C in the other two groups. The authors conclude that deep body temperature provides a practical index of the intrascrotal temperature and is useful as one of the objective, clinical criteria for the diagnosis of varicocele.\r"

This study shows that weekly injections of hCG are effective in achieving virilization in hypogonadotropic hypogonadic males, leading to a greater testicular growth than T preparations. Therefore, hCG treatment may have an advantageous effect on the eventual induction of fertility with human menopausal gonadotropin.\r"

  ".W": "Baboons were immunized using a synthetic peptide adjuvant with two purified pig zona pellucida glycoproteins. The major zona pellucida glycoprotein (ZPI) was purified by preparative isoelectric focusing, and the 80 K deglycosylated zona pellucida protein (ZPIII) was purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The immunogenicity as well as the antigenicity of these proteins were evaluated by characterizing antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunoassay and by immunoblotting of zona pellucida proteins separated by high-resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both groups of animals developed antibodies that recognize the major zona pellucida glycoprotein, (ZPI) and immunoblotting procedures provide evidence that two of the major porcine zona pellucida glycoprotein families (ZPI and ZPIII) contain shared antigenic determinants. The animals immunized with ZPI showed decreased levels of estrogen throughout their menstrual cycles, and two of the animals ceased ovulation. All animals in the group immunized with ZPIII had a significant reduction in the numbers of antral follicles as compared with control animals. Although ovarian cyclicity was not altered significantly within a few months after immunization, two of the five animals in this group became amenorrheic by 8 months. Histologic analysis of ovarian tissue shows that follicles were absent or frequently abnormal in animals of both groups following long-term immunization. These studies demonstrate that the synthetic adjuvant is effective in inducing antibodies (to purified zona pellucida glycoproteins) that recognize antigenic determinants to either denatured or deglycosylated zona pellucida glycoproteins, and that some of these antibodies may interfere with normal ovarian function.\r"

High proportions (95% to 100%) of cumulus-surrounded oocytes matured in vitro in all treatments, but subsequent development was enhanced after maturation with high concentrations of purified bovine luteinizing hormone (LH). Beneficial effects of undisturbed cumulus cells were demonstrated. Improved IVF followed insemination of cumulus-surrounded oocytes, but not denuded oocytes, after maturation with high LH (100 micrograms/ml) versus low LH (10 micrograms/ml), implicating cumulus cells in mediating hormonal enhancement. Oocytes matured with high LH resulted in embryos of superior viability, as reflected by cleavage to 4- to 8-cell stages. Pregnancy resulting from transcervical embryo transfer further documented embryonic viability. These findings should be useful in further development and implementation of reproductive and genetic technologies.\r"

After controlled bladder distension, diabetic animals revealed irregular bladder contractions at frequencies that were reduced to 33% of normal values and with significantly increased amplitudes. The abnormal micturition in diabetic animals was elicited at moderately elevated threshold volumes. These functional abnormalities of the diabetic bladder were associated with a progressive axonopathy of afferent myelinated sensory fibers and later-occurring axonal atrophy of unmyelinated efferent preganglionic fibers. These data suggest that diabetic urinary bladder dysfunction is initiated by a visceral sensory neuropathy involving the afferent limb of the micturition reflex arc.\r"

Our studies of PMN function in healthy subjects demonstrated significant reduction in the respiratory burst after 30 min of in vitro cell exposure to glucose concentrations greater than 11 mM (200 mg/dl). The respiratory burst was reduced 28 +/- 5 and 74 +/- 7% in PMNs incubated with 11 and 56 mM glucose, respectively. The impairment was independent of the cell stimulus (chemotactic peptide, calcium ionophore, or phorbol ester) and was not affected by sorbinil or myo-inositol. Because both D- and L-glucose had similar inhibitory effects, a nonenzymatic mechanism appeared to be the cause of impaired PMN function. Although mannitol and sorbitol did not affect cell function, monosaccharides (glucose, mannose, fructose) that form Schiff-base adducts with protein inhibited PMN function. These findings suggest a potential role for protein glycosylation in glucose-induced impairment of PMN function.\r"

A maximal inhibition of sorbitol in the erythrocytes of 98.3% occurred when the concentration of AA was at its peak in the cells. After incubation, the erythrocyte sorbitol was found to be inversely correlated with the concentration of AA in the erythrocytes. A human supplementation study was conducted with 10 normoglycemic subjects. Each was given 500 mg/day AA alone or in a citrus fruit medium. Each supplementation lasted 2 wk and was followed by a 10-day washout. The citrus fruit medium produced a significantly greater increase in erythrocyte AA compared with AA alone. AA alone and in citrus fruit medium decreased erythrocyte sorbitol 12.6 and 27.2%, respectively, with the latter being significantly more effective. In a study with 4 subjects, 2000 mg/day AA resulted in a reduction in erythrocyte sorbitol of 56.1%. As in the in vitro study, there was an inverse relationship between erythrocyte AA and sorbitol. Two thousand milligrams of AA per day (AA or citrus fruit medium) was given to 8 diabetic subjects in a preliminary 3-wk supplementation trial in which erythrocyte sorbitol levels were decreased by 44.5%. These results suggest that AA supplementation for diabetic subjects may provide a simple means of preventing and ameliorating the complications of diabetes without the use of drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The minimal model approach to estimating insulin sensitivity (Sl) and glucose effectiveness in promoting its own disposition at basal insulin (SG) is a powerful tool that has been underutilized given its potential applications. In part, this has been due to its inability to separate insulin and glucose effects on peripheral uptake from their effects on hepatic glucose inflow. Prior enhancements, with radiotracer labeling of the dosage, permit this separation but are unsuitable for use in pregnancy and childhood. In this study, we labeled the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) dosage with [6,6-2H2]glucose, [2-2H]glucose, or both stable isotopically labeled glucose tracers and modeled glucose kinetics in six postabsorptive, nonobese adults. As previously found with the radiotracer model, the tracer-estimated S*l derived from the stable-label IVGTT was greater than Sl in each case except one, and the tracer-estimated SG* was less than SG in each instance. More importantly, however, the stable-label IVGTT estimated each parameter with an average precision of +/- 5% (range 3-9%) compared to average precisions of +/- 74% (range 7-309%) for SG and +/- 22% (range 3-72%) for Sl. In addition, because of the different metabolic fates of the two deuterated tracers, there were minor differences in basal insulin-derived measures of glucose effectiveness, but these differences were negligible for parameters describing insulin-stimulated processes. In conclusion, the stable-label IVGTT is a simple, highly precise means of assessing insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness at basal insulin that can be used to measure these parameters in individuals of all ages, including children and pregnant women.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH), the rate-limiting enzyme in norepinephrine biosynthesis, was measured in selected sympathetic ganglia to develop a quantitative measure of sympathetic autonomic neuropathy in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Surprisingly, TOH activity was elevated twofold in diabetic prevertebral ganglia innervating the alimentary tract (i.e., superior mesenteric, celiac, and inferior mesenteric), which has terminal processes that develop neuroaxonal dystrophy in this model system. TOH activity of paravertebral ganglia (i.e., superior cervical and stellate) with nonalimentary targets was not increased in the same animals. Increased TOH activity in the prevertebral ganglia 1) developed within the 1st wk of diabetes and persisted for 10 mo, 2) did not represent a change in TOH affinity for d-1,6-methyl-5,6,7,8- tetrahydropterine cofactor, 3) was prevented by both nicotinamide pretreatment and early institution of insulin therapy, and 4) did not develop as a result of classical transsynaptic induction. Pair-feeding experiments confirmed that the most likely cause of increased TOH activity in this system was the marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the diabetic bowel resulting from compensatory hyperphagia. We conclude that TOH activity does not represent a suitable marker for sympathetic autonomic neuropathy in this experimental system. Rather, the increase appears to be an example of a selective increase in the synthesis of neurotransmitter enzymes, possibly in response to increased trophic support provided by the expanded target, i.e., the hypertrophic gut. The additional synthetic stress imposed on prevertebral neurons by the expansion of the innervation of the alimentary target coupled with the complex diabetic metabolic milieu may contribute to the development and selective distribution of dystrophic axonopathy to the innervation of the alimentary tract.\r"

Male Wistar rats (250-275 g) were rendered diabetic by streptozocin (STZ; 55 mg.kg-1). Nondiabetic control rats received the vehicle alone. Two weeks after STZ or vehicle injection, control and diabetic rats were randomly assigned to either a treated or untreated group. Promega was administered at a dose of 0.5 ml.kg-1.day-1 by oral gavage for 4 wk, after which the rats were decapitated, plasma collected, and isolated working heart performance studied. Promega treatment did not affect plasma glucose, triglyceride, or cholesterol concentrations of either the control or diabetic rats. Cardiac performance was assessed by measuring the left ventricular response to changing left atrial filling pressures (7.5-20 cm H2O). The treatment had no effect on peak left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) or maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure during systole (+dP/dtmax) or diastole (-dP/dtmax) in the nondiabetic control rats. LVDP and +/- dP/dt were significantly improved (P less than .05) in the treated diabetic rats compared with untreated diabetic rats, although cardiac performance did not improve to the nondiabetic level. Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium transport activity was not affected by the treatment in the control rats but was significantly improved (P less than .05) in the treated diabetic rats. These data suggest that omega 3FA treatment partially blocks the development of experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy, possibly by affecting SR calcium transport activity.\r"

We therefore characterized restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the insulin-receptor gene with the restriction enzyme Rsa 1 in 242 Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites with type II diabetes and 202 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects who participated in a population-based study in San Antonio. Alleles of 6.7 kilobases (kb) (A allele), 6.2 kb (B allele), and 3.4 kb (C allele) were identified. The C allele was observed in Mexican Americans only, where its frequency among nondiabetic control subjects was 17.7%. Diabetic Mexican Americans were twice as likely as control subjects to be homozygous for the C allele. The crude odds ratio for diabetes in CC homozygotes compared with the other two genotypes was 2.22, although this result was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 1.57, P = .21). The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, adjusting for age, however, indicated a 4.71-fold increased risk of diabetes among Mexican Americans with the CC genotype compared with Mexican Americans without this genotype (chi 2 = 5.38, P = .020). The age of onset of diabetes was also slightly younger in CC homozygote cases (45.4 +/- 9.2 yr) than in CX or XX cases (47.7 +/- 9.0 and 48.6 +/- 9.6 yr, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant (P .467).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study compared the process and outcome of critical care admissions of patients at one hospital by primary care physicians who were either in full-time academic positions or in community based practice. The comparison showed that community physicians treated an older patient population with a different diagnostic mix. Although the community physicians tended to serve older patients with Medicare coverage, the major difference between the two groups was that academic physicians requested 50% more consultations than community physicians (.86 and .56 consultations per admission, respectively). Analysis of outcome measures, such as survival time, readmission rate, and death rate, showed no differences. Survival analysis showed the risk of death to be significantly higher for patients of academic physicians (relative risk = 1.46, C1 = 1.07, 2.00). Other factors contributing significantly to the risk of death included severity of illness, patient age and race, and digestive diseases. The apparent differences in patient outcome between the two groups of physicians are more likely related to underlying differences in the patients than in the clinical approaches of their physicians.\r"

The study subjects were 252 full-term, healthy infants born at the University of Kansas Medical Center over a four-month period. Using a multiple stepwise regression analysis, six factors were found to be significant predictors of higher third-day bilirubin levels: higher cord bilirubin level; lower total serum protein in the infant on admission to the nursery; sex of the child; administration of promethazine hydrochloride during labor; greater weight loss in the infant; and breast-feeding. Several other factors which have been implicated previously--including use of oxytocin for induction or augmentation of labor, previous use of birth control pills by the mother, prolonged rupture of membranes prior to delivery, type of delivery, race, and epidural anesthesia--were not found to be significant predictors of third-day bilirubin levels once the six variables listed had been taken into consideration. The results are discussed in terms of past research as well as implications for clinical practice.\r"

Over a period of 10 weeks, 38% of the calls recorded by the operator were documented by residents in a retrievable fashion. Second-year residents documented calls significantly more than third-year residents, and all residents kept better documentation on calls that concerned young children. Documentation varied significantly among individual residents but was not affected by the day or time of calls. These results suggest that having a system for recording after-hours telephone calls is not sufficient to ensure adequate documentation. Monitoring after-hours call records may provide a solution.\r"

Pertussis toxin was used to determine the contribution of somatostatin to the observed inhibition of acid secretion. Previous studies have shown that at a concentration of 125 ng/ml, pertussis toxin reverses completely the inhibition of acid secretion induced by exogenous and endogenous somatostatin. Preincubation of the stomach for 60 min with pertussis toxin (125 and 1250 ng/ml) reversed partially the inhibitory effect of bombesin on basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion by 51%-59%, implying that bombesin-induced inhibition was partly mediated by release of somatostatin. The residual inhibition may represent a direct effect of bombesin on parietal cells.\r"

Among the biologic and histologic parameters studied, the hyperplasic group differed only by a circulating hypergastrinemia and an antral G-cell hyperplasia. The histamine content, the histidine decarboxylase activity, and the mast cell number of fundic biopsies were determined in 10 controls, 16 of the preceding patients (11 with and 5 without fundic argyrophil-cell hyperplasia), and 5 patients with fundic atrophic gastritis and neither achlorhydria nor hyperplasia. Histamine content and histidine decarboxylase activity were increased only in the hyperplasic group despite an unchanged mast cell number. For all fundic biopsies the argyrophil-cell density was positively related to the histamine content. Finally, the argyrophil-cell hyperplasia occurring in fundic atrophic gastritis with achlorhydria is associated not with the gastritis intensity, as assessed by histologic and secretory criteria, but with a circulating hypergastrinemia and an increase of both fundic histamine content and histidine decarboxylase activity.\r"

The high-osmolality feeding (10% dextrose in water) produced significantly more postcibal gastroesophageal reflux over the entire 2-h interval. The major difference occurred in the second postcibal hour when the amount of gastroesophageal reflux was persistently high for 10% dextrose in water in contrast to the other feedings. We speculate that more rapid gastric emptying of low-osmolality solutions may account for these differences. Clear liquid feeding composition should be standardized during pH testing. Low-osmolality glucose polymer solutions may be more easily tolerated by infants with gastro-esophageal reflux who require carbohydrate or fluid supplements.\r"

To investigate possible metabolic changes in the colonic mucosa during nutrient restriction, we studied substrate utilization by colonocytes isolated from three groups of 6-wk-old rats: control, fasted (72 h), and chronically malnourished animals. Isolated colonocytes were incubated with nonlabeled and 14C-labeled substrates (glucose, glutamine, n-butyrate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate). Substrate oxidation and net increase of intermediary metabolites were reduced in fasted and malnourished animals. The effect of fasting on substrate oxidation was greater than that of chronic malnutrition for all substrates tested except n-butyrate. The total ketone body concentrations and beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratios were higher in the fasted and malnourished groups than in controls. The findings suggest that the colonic mucosa responds to nutrient deprivation by a general reduction of oxidative metabolism that is associated with an altered redox state.\r"

The rabbit and opossum were used because both have stratified squamous epithelium; however, only the opossum has, in addition, an extensive network of submucosal glands. Mean basal AS in the rabbit was 0.02 +/- 0.005 muEq/h . cm2, with one-third of the animals having no AS. Basal AS was present in all opossums with a mean value 20-fold greater than in rabbits (0.39 +/- 0.03 muEq/h . cm2). Basal AS in both species was found by titration methodology to be comprised almost entirely of secreted bicarbonate ions. In the rabbit, AS could not be stimulated by luminal HCl, i.v. carbachol, or i.v. NaHCO3. In contrast, luminal HCl stimulated AS in opossums three- to fourfold above basal values, and neither the acid-stimulated nor basal AS in the opossum was blocked by i.v. atropine. Acid clearance by AS was monitored in both species in vivo. In the rabbit, pH increased from 2.0 to 3.6 in 1 h, with a steady rate of rise after equilibration of 0.1 pH units/10 min. In the opossum, pH increased from 2.0 to 6.4 in 1 h, with a steady rate of rise five times faster than rabbits (0.5 pH units/10 min). These results indicate that the mammalian esophagus can secrete a bicarbonate-containing fluid with the capacity to clear acid from the esophageal lumen. The major source of this secretion is not the squamous epithelium, but probably the submucosal glands. Because the human esophagus has both submucosal glands and a mechanism for acid clearance consistent with the presence of AS, the findings in opossums may have relevance to protection against reflux disease in humans.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the ability of topical 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 in a dose range of 0.3-3.0 micrograms/ml to prevent aspirin-induced injury in the canine stomach under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. For in vitro studies, isolated strips of oxyntic mucosa were exposed to 10 or 20 mM aspirin (ASA) at pH 1-4, with and without treatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. For in vivo experiments, a portion of the oxyntic stomach was mounted between the rings of a Lucite chamber, with splenic vessels intact, such that the mucosa was divided into halves. Both sides were exposed to 20 mM ASA at pH 1 or 2, and one side also received concomitant treatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. After ASA exposure, tissue samples were prepared for quantitative microscopic analysis of the degree of injury. Under both experimental conditions, the magnitude of gastric injury by ASA was pH-related, being most pronounced at pH 1; this damage was worse under in vitro conditions, and both concentrations of ASA were equally damaging in this setting. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 failed to prevent ASA injury in vitro at any pH and ASA concentration tested, but markedly reduced the magnitude of injury in vivo. The most effective protective dose of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 under in vivo conditions was 1.0 micrograms/ml. The diminished tolerance to ASA damage in vitro when compared with in vivo, and the inability of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 to prevent these damaging effects in vitro, underscores the probable crucial role for blood flow, and possibly neural innervation, in mediating the protective effects of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "The electrical correlates of peristaltic and nonperistaltic esophageal contractions were characterized in anesthetized opossums using simultaneous suction electrode and intraluminal pressure recordings from sites 1 and 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Transient midesophageal balloon distention produced peristaltic contractions with faster propagation velocity than swallow-induced peristalsis. This was associated with prompt circular smooth muscle hyperpolarization at both sites, then depolarization, spike burst, and esophageal contraction. At the 5-cm site hyperpolarization was followed by rapid depolarization, whereas at the 1-cm site there was a much slower rate of depolarization after the initial hyperpolarization. Thus the longer latency to contraction at the 1-cm site correlated with the timing of the depolarization phase and not with the duration of the initial hyperpolarization. With prolonged balloon distention the inflation-related membrane hyperpolarization was followed by either partial or complete repolarization during sustained distention. Upon balloon deflation there was rapid membrane depolarization and spike burst at both sites such that the resultant contractions were usually nonperistaltic. In some instances balloon distention evoked contractions of slow peristaltic velocity. These correlated with membrane potential oscillations at the 1-cm site, with threshold depolarization being reached at the second depolarization in the hyperpolarization-depolarization sequences that followed balloon deflation. A similar pattern was seen with swallow-induced peristalsis. These studies demonstrate that differences in timing of the depolarization that follows initial hyperpolarization, and not differences in the duration of the initial hyperpolarization, are important in the genesis of peristaltic esophageal contractions.\r"

Parameters evaluated included (a) depth of injury, (b) efficacy of hemostasis (bleeding gastric ulcer model), and (c) strength of coaptive bonding (mesenteric artery model). Depth of injury was graded histologically 1 wk after coagulation as the percentage of lesions showing gastric full-thickness damage for each probe. In depth-of-injury studies probes were applied at maximum force (established endoscopically with a specially designed force gauge) and at maximum power settings (50 W Microtaze, 30 J heater probe, dial setting 10 BICAP) to determine safety. There was no significant difference in the percentage of external muscle layer damage: 85%, 74%, and 86% for Microtaze, heater probe, and BICAP, respectively. Hemostasis was achieved 100% of the time in endoscopically induced bleeding gastric ulcers in heparinized dogs. Canine mesenteric arteries measuring 1-2 mm in diameter were isolated at laparotomy and coaptively sealed, and the bond strength was measured by application of hydrostatic pressure. Bursting pressures were not significantly different for Microtaze, heater probe, or BICAP probes (1062 +/- 77 mmHg, 863 +/- 85 mmHg, and 1154 +/- 139 mmHg, respectively). In conclusion, microwave energy may be applied endoscopically to produce hemostasis with similar safety and efficacy to BICAP and heater probe.\r"

Because there is currently no evidence as to whether restitution occurs in human tissue, this study examined human and rabbit colonic mucosa after superficial injury and monitored the potential difference, alkaline flux, and speed and mechanisms of mucosal restitution as observed with light and electron microscopy. Luminal exposure of the in vivo rabbit colon to 100 mM HCl for 5 min or the in vitro human colon to 10 mM HCl for 10 min caused superficial mucosal injury to 76% of the epithelial surface in the rabbit and 95% in the human. The necrotic epithelial cells detached in sheets from the intact basal lamina and formed a protective mucoid layer. Morphologic evidence of restitution occurred within 15 min after injury in the rabbit and 30 min in the human, as viable nongoblet cells projected lamellipodia and migrated over the denuded basal lamina at a speed of approximately 2 microns/min. One hour after damage 61% of the mucosal surface was still damaged in the rabbit, and 86% of the human mucosal surface was damaged after 2 h. In the following 60 min restitution progressed rapidly, so that only 10% of the surface remained unrepaired in the rabbit after 2 h and 19% in the human after 3 h. Small areas with deeper injury did not repair until 5 h after damage. The potential difference dropped after mucosal injury and did not recover despite morphologic repair. Rapid epithelial restitution is considered to be a basic defense mechanism of the gastrointestinal mucosa that is obviously not necessarily related to the presence of an acidic environment in the stomach or duodenum.\r"

Esophageal injury was seen in 87.8% of the patients, gastric injury in 85.4%, and duodenal injury in 34.1%. All patients with grade 0, 1, and 2a injury recovered without sequelae. Acute complications occurred in 39.1% of the cases, and death in 12.2%. It is significant that all such patients had grade 3 burns. Five of the 8 patients with grade 2b injury and all survivors of grade 3 injury developed esophageal or gastric cicatrization, or both, which subsequently needed endoscopic or surgical treatment. We find that endoscopy is not only the tool of choice for diagnosis in such cases but also aids in deciding upon treatment and prognosis. We conclude that acid injury of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a very serious condition that affects the esophagus and stomach equally and results in high morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic activities and the isoenzyme patterns of both alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase have been studied in 60 alcoholics with varying degrees of liver damage (from normal tissue or minimal changes to cirrhosis with alcoholic hepatitis) and in 24 nonalcoholics with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis in order to ascertain their association with liver damage. In alcoholics both alcohol dehydrogenase and low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase activities decreased proportionally with the severity of liver disease. In contrast, in nonalcoholics, there was a reduction of low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase activity related to the severity of liver injury, but alcohol dehydrogenase was similar in patients with chronic hepatitis and nonalcoholic cirrhosis. There were no significant changes in total and high-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase activities among the different histologic groups studied, although the lowest activities were observed in patients with more severe liver injury. The prevalence of atypical alcohol dehydrogenase was similar in alcoholic (6.6%) and in nonalcoholic (8.3%) liver disease. All patients exhibited isoenzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase II, whereas isoenzyme I was not detected in 39.5% of the alcoholic patients and in 9.5% of those with nonalcoholic liver disease. The lack of aldehyde dehydrogenase I was observed in cases with the lowest enzymatic activities. These results suggest that the decrease of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities in alcoholics is not a primary defect and, therefore, their decrease is secondary to liver damage. It is speculated that the diminution of alcohol dehydrogenase, found particularly in alcoholics, could be due to centrilobular cell necrosis.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of this event and to assess the effectiveness of a postdissolution treatment in preventing it. We evaluated the long-term recurrence rate after 96 confirmed dissolutions observed in 86 subjects (71 women, 15 men) over a 12-yr follow-up period. A low-dose postdissolution treatment (ursodeoxycholic acid, 300 mg/day) was administered to 36 subjects, whereas in the remaining 60 cases no postdissolution treatment was given. By actuarial life-table analysis, the cumulative proportion of gallstone recurrence was 12.5% at the first year, rising to 61% at the 11th year. Postdissolution treatment was effective in reducing the frequency of gallstone recurrence (p = 0.0067), but this was mainly related to its effect on younger subjects (less than or equal to 50 yr old). In older subjects the recurrence rate was unaffected by treatment. The probability of gallstone recurrence was significantly higher in subjects with multiple stones before dissolution treatment than in those who had had solitary stones (p = 0.0091). No other factor predictive of gallstone recurrence could be identified.\r"

Pancreatic amino acid uptake was assessed by measuring free plasma amino acid concentration before and during pancreatic stimulation with secretin (1 CU/kg body wt.h) and cerulein (50 ng/kg body wt.h). Pancreatic stimulation with these peptides caused a significant decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations. Somatostatin, given at the dosages of 0.15 and 1.35 micrograms/kg body wt.h, significantly diminished this decrease. The effect of the higher dose of somatostatin was more marked than that produced by the lower dose, compatible with dose dependence. The results suggest that somatostatin is able to inhibit the amino acid uptake by the pancreatic acinar cells. This inhibitory effect could be an important mechanism by which the peptide decreases pancreatic enzyme secretion.\r"

  ".U": "89326070\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of single-energy computed tomography in determining iron overload in idiopathic hemochromatosis, with special reference to slightly overloaded cases. Liver attenuation was determined in 100 patients (46 cases of idiopathic hemochromatosis, 32 cases of chronic liver disease, and 22 normal controls). The iron load was determined for the first two groups by biochemical determination of liver iron concentration (performed in all but 12 subjects in the chronic liver disease group) and hepatic histologic grading. The main results for liver attenuation (upper normal limit, 72 Hounsfield units) showed that despite a high specificity (0.96), this parameter was of low sensitivity (0.63). Although mean liver attenuation in idiopathic hemochromatosis (77 +/- 14) was significantly higher than in chronic liver diseases (53 +/- 17; p less than 10(-4) and normal controls (66 +/- 3; p less than 10(-3], and despite an overall good correlation between liver attenuation and liver iron concentration (r = 0.72; p less than 10(-3], liver attenuation was unable to detect moderate iron overload. Fourteen of 18 patients with a liver iron concentration of less than 150 mumol/g dry liver wt had liver attenuation values of less than 72. Moreover, 3 of 18 subjects with a liver iron concentration of greater than 150 had a liver attenuation of less than 72. Of these 17 false-negatives, only 7 could be attributed to associated steatosis. On the whole, single-energy computed tomography, when used on a routine basis for diagnosing iron overload, is of limited clinical value in idiopathic hemochromatosis due to its poor sensitivity. Hepatic histologic examination together with biochemical determination remains the most accurate means to assess liver iron.\r"

We report a patient with progressively worsening perineal and biopsy-proven cutaneous Crohn's disease that had been refractory to surgery and medical treatment (sulfasalazine, steroids, 6-mercaptopurine, metronidazole, antibiotics). As the lesions were reminiscent of problem wounds occurring in other situations, hyperbaric oxygen treatment was instituted while the patient was continued on metronidazole. Response was dramatic with almost immediate relief of symptoms and regression within 2.5 mo of wounds that had previously defied therapy for 8 yr. Clinical remission has not been sustained as four subsequent courses of hyperbaric oxygen have been given over a period of 11 mo. However, the patient has been essentially asymptomatic since her initial course and the extent of her cutaneous disease has been minimal compared with that before hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is costly and should not be routinely used in every patient with perineal Crohn's disease. However, this case report may herald an advance in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this complication and ultimately, its therapy.\r"

In the first sample, peroxisomes exhibited matrical heterogeneity and dense nucleoids. Peroxisomes in the second biopsy sample lacked nucleoids and contained more homogeneous matrices. The mean peroxisomal diameter increased from 0.77 +/- 0.33 to 0.86 +/- 0.32 microM (normal, 0.62 +/- 0.14).

  ".W": "Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (LOSR) is the major mechanism underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. The mediation and control of LOSRs are incompletely understood but evidence suggests a neural inhibitory mechanism. In this study we have evaluated the effect of gastric distension on LOS function in 16 patients with untreated idiopathic achalasia and compared it with that in 10 healthy controls. With the subjects sitting, the stomach was distended with a liquid mixture that generated 750 ml CO2. Oesophageal pH and motility were monitored for 10 minutes before and after distension. In normal controls, gastric distension induced a four-fold increase in the rate of LOSRs and gas reflux episodes (as evidenced by oesophageal common cavities), whereas this response was absent in the achalasia patients. Basal LOS pressure did not change in either group. These findings are consistent with the notion that transient LOSRs induced by gastric distension are neurally mediated, probably by the same inhibitory nerves that govern swallow mediated LOS relaxation.\r"

Transit studies were also done in 10 patients after cardiomyotomy and in 10 normal subjects. Images were recorded with the subjects seated in front of a gamma camera while swallowing a 10 ml bolus of 99Tcm-tin colloid and then after a further drink of 50 ml water. There was marked retention of tracer in the oesophagus in patients with achalasia compared with rapid clearance in control subjects. Bag dilatation significantly reduced lower oesophageal sphincter pressure but there was no significant difference in the 50% clearance time or percentage dose retained at 100s before and after the treatments. Oesophageal clearance of tracer after the additional drink of water, was improved by bag dilatation. Oesophageal transit in the patients after cardiomyotomy was similar to that in patients who had undergone bag dilatation. There was considerable retention of the tracer in the oesophagus overnight, but this did not result in pulmonary aspiration. Radionuclide oesophageal transit studies provided a quantitative assessment of therapy in achalasia and the proportion of tracer retained after the additional drink proved to be a sensitive measure of response to treatment. Nifedipine proved ineffective as a treatment for achalasia. Bag dilatation and cardiomyotomy were of similar value.\r"

Hydrochloric acid, applied directly to the apical surface of chief cells using culture plate inserts (Millipore) had no effect on secretion, nor did it affect the action of any secretagogue in the basolateral medium. All prostaglandins tested showed significant stimulation of pepsinogen secretion. Basal secretion of pepsinogen after 90 min was 9.4 (1.3)% to total initial monolayer content. At 10(-6) M, PGE1 stimulated secretion was 26.1 (3.8)%; PGE2 27.9 (4)% and Enisoprost 28.8 (4.2)% of initial pepsinogen content. Stimulations by all tested prostaglandins were additive with carbachol (10(-4) M) and CCK (10(-9) M), but not with VIP (10(-6) M), dbcAMP (10(-3) M) or forskolin (10(-6) M) responses. All three prostaglandins stimulated pepsinogen synthesis as measured by 14C labelled amino acid incorporation into pepsinogen. Time course experiments were similar to those for forskolin and showed shorter time delays between stimulus and increased synthesis rate than carbachol but longer than dbcAMP. Stimulated pepsinogen secretion was inhibited by high pepsin concentrations (greater than 800 micrograms/ml) in the medium. The inhibited abolished simultaneous carbachol induced stimulation of synthesis but prostaglandin or forskolin stimulation only after two hours. Combined with the shorter response time, as compared with carbachol, these data support our previous findings that potent stimulators of cAMP production can stimulate pepsinogen synthesis directly by stimulation of mRNA synthesis, independently from an increased secretion. The additivity of effects with carbachol or CCK and similarity with forskolin stimulated synthesis supports the suggestion that the actions of prostaglandins are mediated by cAMP.\r"

The volunteers fell into two groups: In seven no sympathetic activation was elicited as no changes in heart rate were demonstrated. Gastric pH was unchanged, and PD increased slightly. Sympathetic activation was elicited in the other six with increased heart rate by 18 (6) beats per min. Potential difference declined significantly during sympathetic activation (delta PD = -5 (2)mV, p less than 0.05). Gastric pH increased. Eleven of 12 ulcer patients had sympathetic activation accompanied by a decline in PD, and an increased pH. Sympathetic activation in ulcer patients and volunteers impaired gastric mucosal function, as shown by a decline in gastric PD.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple pinch biopsies were taken from the duodenum and antrum of 137 subjects (46 active duodenal ulceration; 44 healed ulcers; 47 'normal'), and examined for the presence and grade of gastritis, gastric metaplasia, and Campylobacter pylori. These factors, as well as age, sex, cigarette, and anti-inflammatory agent intake were evaluated as possible risk factors for duodenal ulceration. Pentagastrin induced Congo Red staining of the duodenal bulb was performed in an additional 43 cases, to determine the presence of functioning parietal cells in the duodenum. Ninety eight per cent of patients with duodenal infection with C pylori had active or healed duodenal ulcers. Bacteria were confined to areas of gastric metaplasia which was always infiltrated with inflammatory cells. The metaplastic tissue was usually superficial in type, although patients had C pylori associated with heterotopic tissue: this has not been previously described. Congo Red staining of the duodenal bulb showed that functioning endogenous acid producing tissue could be found most often at the edges of duodenal ulcers, but also in non-ulcer subjects. Cigarette smoking, age, sex, and ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were not to be found to be significant risk factors for duodenal ulceration. In contrast, the presence of duodenal infection with C pylori proved to be a strong risk factor for duodenal ulceration (RR = 51), together with gastric metaplasia (RR = 6.2), and antral C pylori infection (RR = 7.6). These data identify duodenal infection with C pylori as the strongest risk factor for development of duodenal ulceration. Our finding of endogenous acid production around the edges of duodenal ulcers suggests an active role for parietal cells in the duodenum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "14C-urea breath test was used to detect Campylobacter pylori colonisation in 129 consecutive non-ulcer dyspepsia patients. Fasting patients were given 3 microCi (110 kBq) of 14C-labelled urea after a test meal. Breath samples were collected at 10 minute intervals for 90 minutes and the C-14 activity was counted on a liquid scintillation analyser. Urea derived 14CO2 appears in the exhaled breath of Campylobacter pylori culture positive individuals within 20-30 minutes. Likelihood analysis revealed a most favourable cut off level of [0.07% dose 14C-urea/mmol CO2] multiplied by body weight at t = 40 minutes, to separate culture positive from culture negative subjects. Using this upper limit of normal, a positive likelihood ratio of 50 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.05 was calculated. Sensitivity of the test was 95% and specificity 98%. The 14C-urea breath test is a simple, sensitive and non-invasive test, that detects viable C pylori microorganism and semiquantitatively assesses the bacterial load of C pylori colonisation. Administration of a single dose of colloidal bismuth subcitrate resulted in a rapid decrease in 14CO2 excretion, so this test can be used to confirm eradication of the bacterium in therapeutic trials without endoscopy, or need for culture.\r"

There were significant changes in the binding pattern of three lectins (Dolichos biflorus, Ulex europaeus, Ricinus communis), with special reference to goblet cells staining. These changes were present in all the specimens studied, regardless of the clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis or coeliac disease. Dolichos biflorus reactive goblet cells were significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) in abnormal tissue and confined to the luminal edge of the mucosa. Strong reactivity of goblet cells in abnormal tissue was recorded with Ricinus communis and Ulex europaeus, lectins that bind to few or no goblet cells in normal tissue. These findings show that modifications of structural and secretory glycoconjugates occur in the jejunal mucosa of patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy.\r"

We studied eight healthy subjects by interval sampling of end expiratory H2 concentration for 12 hours after ingestion of: (1) 10 g lactulose (L); (2) 10 g L with 20 mg metoclopramide (M) as tablets; (3) 20 g L, and (4) 20 g L with 7.5 mg diphenoxylate (D) as tablets, in random order. In spite of significant changes in OCTT after M and D, there were no significant changes, compared for the same dose of lactulose, with respect to area under the breath H2 excretion curves, peak increments of H2 concentration or timing of the peak increment. We conclude that, within the ranges observed, the OCTT does not significantly affect the shape of the H2 concentration versus time curves. In comparative studies estimates of the degree of carbohydrate malabsorption on the basis of breath H2 concentration may be valid in spite of differences in OCTT.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the role of hind gut fermentation in the proliferative response of the intestinal epithelium to dietary fibre. We have previously shown that refeeding starved rats with an elemental diet supplemented with fermentable dietary fibre (but not inert bulk) is capable of stimulating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Three groups of 10 germ free (GF) rats and three groups of 10 conventional (CV) rats, were used. All groups were starved for three days and then refed for two days with either an elemental diet (Flexical); Flexical plus 30% kaolin; or Flexical plus 30% of a fibre mixture. Cell production was determined by the accumulation of vincristine arrested metaphases in microdissected crypts. There was no significant difference between refeeding the rats with an elemental diet alone or with kaolin supplementation, however, the addition of fibre in CV rats was associated with a significant increase in intestinal crypt cell production rate in both the small intestine (p less than 0.01) and the colon (p less than 0.001). This marked proliferative effects of fibre was abolished in the GF rats. It can be concluded that it is the products of hind gut fermentation, not fibre per se that stimulate intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in the colon and small intestine.\r"

Immunoperoxidase staining with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and histochemical staining for acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase was performed. In the superficial lamina propria, normal colonic macrophages were larger and more strongly positive for acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase than those in normal terminal ileum. There were more macrophages staining with monoclonal antibody RFD1 in the superficial lamina propria of the latter. Studies in inflammatory bowel disease tissue showed the presence of macrophages staining with monoclonal antibodies RFD9 and 3G8 which were rarely present in normal tissue and represented a different pattern from that seen in infectious colitis. Studies on isolated intestinal macrophages confirmed the findings in tissue sections. Subpopulations of intestinal macrophages are likely to have different functional roles. Phenotypic changes during inflammation may be induced by mediators of inflammation or may represent a recently recruited population of cells.\r"

Seventy outbred female Wistar rats treated with DMH (40 mg/kg, subcutaneously weekly for five weeks) were killed and autopsied in batches of 10 every five weeks from the 10th to 40th weeks from first treatment. The resulting 378 colonic lesions were assigned to benign or malignant categories using each of three standard histopathological thresholds of malignancy: alpha, the transition from dysplasia to intraepithelial carcinoma; beta, invasion through the crypt basement membrane; and gamma, invasion through the muscularis mucosae. These comprised 79 'benign' and 299 'malignant' or 273 'benign' and 141 'malignant' lesions depending on the threshold (alpha or gamma) assigned (p less than 0.001). Decreasing ratios of pre-threshold to post-threshold lesions between 15 and 40 weeks (alpha, 2.0 to 0.051; beta, 3.5 to 0.57; gamma, 8.0 to 0.87) provide some support for an 'adenoma-carcinoma' progression for each. Comparison of time-dependent prevalence curves confirms that the alpha threshold (cyto-architecture) is qualitatively different from the beta and gamma thresholds (invasion), showing that the adenoma-carcinoma and de novo hypotheses need not be mutually exclusive. The time-dependent prevalence data support de novo origin of some carcinomas, as well as at least two other modes of accrual for neoplastic lesions.\r"

Antibodies were raised in rabbits to purified GST subunits and several formalin fixed paraffin sections of each human tissue studied using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Staining density was graded from very strong (+++) to negative (-). All four enzymes were identified within the liver, the acidic GST being found almost exclusively within the biliary epithelium. The gall bladder epithelium stained strongly for acidic and basic GST. In the small intestinal epithelium the acidic and neutral GST were readily identified in villi and crypts, whilst basic GST was found only in the villi and microsomal only in the crypts. In the colonic mucosa only acidic GST could consistently be identified. This histological heterogeneity may have functional implications for these enzymes in human hepatobiliary and intestinal tissue.\r"

This paper describes biliary bile acids analysis performed on 13 patients undergoing cholecystectomy for gall stones, 10 patients undergoing colonic resection for colon cancer, and eight control patients. For all 31 patients the total bile acids concentration was highly variable (8.3 mg/ml-106.5 mg/ml). The median ratio of primary to secondary bile acids was 2.7:1. The biliary bile acid ratios were similar in both control patients (3.7:1) and those with colon cancer (3.1:1), whereas patients with gall stones had significantly higher secondary bile acid levels in their biliary bile (ratio 1.9:1, p = less than 0.05). This result indicates that raised biliary deoxycholate concentrations are not present in patients with colon cancer and are therefore unlikely to be a major predisposing factor in the aetiology of this disease. It is unlikely that cholelithiasis and/or cholecystectomy predispose to the subsequent development of colon tumours.\r"

Plasma CCK concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, and gall bladder contraction by cholescintigraphy were studied in response to intraduodenal fat with and without addition of pancreatic enzymes. Fasting plasma CCK concentrations were in the same range in six patients with pancreatic insufficiency with (2.6 (0.2) pmol/l) and without (2.6 (0.3) pmol/l) addition of pancreatic enzymes and in six healthy subjects (2.0 (0.4) pmol/l). The integrated plasma CCK secretion in response to intraduodenal fat was significantly (p less than 0.005) reduced in the patients without addition of enzymes (46 (13) pmol/1.90 min) compared with healthy subjects (199 (22) pmol/1.90 min), but increased significantly (p less than 0.01) by the addition of pancreatic enzymes (174 (25) pmol/1.90 min) to values not significantly different from healthy subjects. Similarly, gall bladder emptying in response to intraduodenal fat was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in patients with pancreatic insufficiency without addition of enzymes (at 90 min: 35 (11)%) compared with healthy subjects (at 90 min: 66 (7)%) but significantly (p less than 0.01) increased by addition of pancreatic enzymes (at 90 min: 70 (8)%) to values not significantly different from healthy subjects. These results indicate that patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency have impaired gall bladder emptying after intraduodenal fat, which can be normalised by the addition of pancreatic enzymes. This impaired gall bladder emptying appears to be the result of a reduced plasma CCK response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this group the mean serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels decreased significantly (from 425 to 61 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01). In the nonresponders the mean serum Tg levels did not change significantly (145 vs. 250 micrograms/L). The mean serum T4, free T4, free T3, and rT3 concentrations increased significantly in both groups during T4 therapy, serum T3 levels did not change, and serum TSH decreased. These findings demonstrate that serum Tg levels decrease when T4 therapy is effective. Thus, serum Tg measurements may prove a useful indicator of the efficacy of T4 therapy in patients with solitary nodules.\r"

For this purpose guinea pig adrenal segments kept in organ culture were exposed to ACTH and graded concentrations of patient IgG. After a 5-h culture period the cortisol present in the culture fluid was measured by RIA, and DNA synthesis in the adrenal cells was measured using Feulgen densitometry on frozen sections of the cultured adrenal segments. Addition of ACTH alone in concentrations of 0.1-10 pmol/L to the culture system stimulated in vitro cortisol secretion; the maximal stimulation was 63 +/- 35% (+/- SD; n = 5) at a concentration 0.1 pmol/L. ACTH also increased (in concentrations of 1 fmol/L to 1 pmol/L) the percentage of fasciculata cells in S-phase from 0-4% (nonstimulated) to 5-12%. IgG preparations from all but 2 of the 25 patients with idiopathic Addison's disease blocked these in vitro ACTH-induced adrenal responses in a dose-dependent fashion. IgG from 2 patients with tuberculous adrenalitis, 1 patient with secondary adrenal insufficiency, and 7 normal subjects had no blocking activity. Among 5 non-Addisonian autoimmune endocrinopathy patients who had adrenal cytoplasmic autoantibodies, 4 had no ACTH-blocking IgGs. Two of 9 patients with miscellaneous adrenal disorders (Cushing's disease, pigmented adrenal micronodular dysplasia, and adrenal nodules) had ACTH-blocking activity. These results demonstrate the existence of IgGs blocking the in vitro effects of ACTH and suggest their involvement in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Addison's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for the elevated levels of circulating GH observed in diabetes mellitus (DM) remain incompletely defined. To assess the episodic fluctuations in serum GH as a reflection of hypothalamic-pituitary activity, we accumulated GH concentration-time series in a total of 48 adult men and women with and without insulin-dependent DM by obtaining serum samples at 10-min intervals over 24 h. Significant pulses of GH release were subsequently identified and characterized by an objective, statistically based pulse detection algorithm (Cluster) and fixed circadian (24-h) periodicities of secretory activity, resolved using Fourier expansion time-series analysis. Compared to those in age-matched controls, integrated 24-h concentrations of GH were 2- to 3.5-fold higher in diabetic men (P = 0.002) and women (P = 0.0005). Both men and women with DM had over 50% more GH pulses per 24 h than their non-DM counterparts. In addition, maximal GH pulse amplitude was markedly elevated in the men and women with DM (P = 0.0019 and 0.0189, respectively). That the increase in maximal pulse amplitude was accounted for by greater baseline levels was documented by a higher interpulse valley mean GH concentration in the diabetics compared to the controls (P = 0.0437 and 0.0056, men and women, respectively) and the absence of any difference in incremental pulse amplitude for either sex (P greater than 0.05). DM men had larger GH pulse areas (P = 0.039) than control men, apparently accounted for by greater pulse width (P = 0.0037). Pulse areas in DM and non-DM women were indistinguishable. Time-series analysis revealed that the 24-h (circadian) rhythms of serum GH concentrations exhibited significantly increased amplitudes in the diabetic group as a whole (compared to the controls, P = 0.011). However, the times of maximal GH concentrations (acrophases) were not significantly different. As a group, serum insulin-like growth factor-I was lower in DM vs. non-DM individuals (P = 0.0014), although when separated by sex this difference did not reach statistical significance in women (P = 0.317). The present data confirm the higher circulating levels of GH previously reported to occur in individuals with poorly controlled DM. The altered frequency of GH pulses together with enhanced interpulse GH concentrations and an amplified circadian GH rhythm are compatible with hypothalamic dysfunction associated with dysregulation of somatostatin and/or GHRH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

[3H]Thymidine uptake was measured in chondrocyte clusters, and specific PG and coll II RIAs were performed every 4 days on the culture medium and cell aggregates; total PG and coll II production were also assessed at different culture durations by adding the amounts found in culture media and their corresponding clusters. Incubation with hCT or sCT did not affect [3H]thymidine uptake regardless of the dose. For each culture period, PG and coll II release into culture medium, cluster content, and total production increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Cumulative curves for these parameters showed a progressive significant increase with culture duration at hCT and sCT doses of 0, 5, and 10 ng/mL. Cumulative curves obtained with 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL were seldom significantly different from one another. No differences emerged between the use of hCT or sCT. Thus, CT exerted no proliferative effect on human articular chondrocytes in tridimensional culture, but displayed a dose-dependent and prolonged stimulatory effect on PG and coll II production. CT may possess chondroprotective properties in addition to its other known effects.\r"

Cell incubations with increasing doses of [125I](SAR1)AII, ranging from 0.01-2.5 nmol/L, were carried out for 20 min at 37 C. The results indicated the presence of specific low capacity [4300 +/- 1300 (+/- SE) sites/cell], high affinity (Kd = 0.38 +/- 0.06 nmol/L) binding sites for [125I](Sar1)AII. This binding was specific for AII analogs. When placental cells were preloaded with 40 microCi/mL [3H]myoinositol for 2 h at 37 C, AII stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphate (InsP) production [EC50 = 1.4 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) nmol/L], as measured by ion exchange chromatography. (Sar1)AII also stimulated InsP production, with an EC50 of 0.3 +/- 0.2 nmol/L. AII-stimulated production of InsP was completely blocked by the antagonist (Sar1,Ala8)AII. AII also stimulated human placental lactogen release from trophoblastic cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The EC50 was 18 +/- 9 pmol/L, and the stimulation was blocked by (Sar1,Ala8)AII, as found for AII-stimulated InsP production. These results suggest that stimulation of human placental lactogen release by AII may be mediated by activation of phospholipase-C, which, in turn, produces phosphoinositide breakdown. The results, therefore, provide evidence of a physiological role for the renin-angiotensin system within the human placenta.\r"

In this study we examined the effect of peripheral muscarinic blockade with atropine on metoclopramide-, angiotensin-II-, and ACTH-stimulated aldosterone secretion in man. Atropine (0.6 mg, iv) administered 10 min before MCP delayed the onset of the plasma aldosterone response and attenuated the mean peak response from 502 +/- 103 (+/- SE) to 322 +/- 72 pmol/L (P less than 0.05) without affecting zero time mean plasma aldosterone levels (144 +/- 28 vs. 136 +/- 36 pmol/L for control and atropine, respectively). This inhibitory effect was not mediated by changes in PRA or plasma potassium or ACTH (as reflected by cortisol) concentrations. Atropine also attenuated the plasma aldosterone response to a low dose angiotensin II infusion (2 ng/kg.min; control, 449 +/- 99 pmol/L; atropine, 297 +/- 78 pmol/L; P less than 0.05). In contrast, atropine had no effect on the plasma aldosterone response to a bolus dose (250 micrograms) of ACTH. Neither atropine (0.6 mg, iv) nor the cholinergic muscarinic agonist bethanechol (5 mg, sc) alone elicited a change in plasma aldosterone. Collectively, these data provide evidence for cholinergic modulation of aldosterone secretion in man. We conclude that cholinergic mechanisms may facilitate the aldosterone responses to angiotensin-II and metoclopramide, but not to ACTH.\r"

  ".W": "Analytical ion microscopy (AIM) can be used for imaging and relative quantification of chemical elements in tissue sections. We used this technique to assess the changes in 127I mapping within thyroid follicular cells and follicular lumina in benign thyroid epithelial abnormalities from 17 patients and in macroscopically normal perinodular tissue surrounding solitary cold nodules from 8 patients. Among the 17 patients, 9 had simple goiters, 5 had toxic nodular goiters, and 3 had hypofunctioning (cold) nodules. The tissue samples were fixed chemically and embedded in methacrylate resin to ensure preservation of organified iodine, and thin sections were analyzed by AIM. 127I was found in the follicular lumina and follicular epithelial cells of most specimens. The local concentration of 127I, which is proportional to the ratio of the two secondary ion beam currents of iodine and carbon, was evaluated in 30 follicular lumina and 30 follicular epithelial cells of each specimen. In normal tissue, the relative 127I concentration within follicular cells (mean, 0.72; range 0.01-8.30) was much lower than that in follicular lumina (mean, 4.63; range, 0.18-36.74). In simple goiter tissue, follicular lumen (mean, 0.57; range, 0.00-5.76), and cell (mean, 0.17; range, 0.002-1.82) relative 127I concentrations were below normal, but both distributions remained different. On the contrary, in toxic nodular goiter tissue the follicular cell relative 127I concentration (mean, 0.96; range, 0.003-27.3) largely overlapped that of the follicular lumina (mean, 2.1; range, 0.001-36.5). The cold nodules had the lowest relative follicular lumina 127I concentration (mean, 0.008; range, undetectable-0.07), and the relative cellular 127I concentrations were undetectable in 67%. These results demonstrate the capacity of AIM to characterize the functional activity of thyroid tissue without prior administration of radio-iodine.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the presence of and possible changes in plasma and amniotic fluid immunoreactive neuropeptide-Y (irNPY) levels in pregnant women during gestation and at parturition. We studied 127 healthy pregnant and 12 nonpregnant women. The peptide was extracted from plasma or amniotic fluid with a propanolformic acid mixture and measured by RIA. The mean plasma irNPY concentration in 15 pregnant women during the first trimester of gestation was 129 +/- 12 (+/- SE) pmol/L, compared to 40 +/- 8 pmol/L in nonpregnant women (p less than 0.01). The mean values were 144 +/- 13 and 156 +/- 24 pmol/L, respectively, in 15 pregnant women during the second trimester and 33 women during the third trimester. These values did not differ from that during the first trimester. Amniotic fluid irNPY levels were similar to those in plasma and did not vary among the 3 groups of women studied during the various trimesters of gestation. During labor, plasma irNPY levels progressively increased, reaching the highest levels at the most advanced stages of cervical dilatation (greater than 8 cm, 351 +/- 38 pmol/L) and at the time of vaginal delivery (416 +/- 73 pmol/L). Plasma irNPY levels then decreased significantly 2 h after vaginal delivery. The amniotic fluid irNPY levels in women during the early or late stages of labor were similar. Moreover, plasma and amniotic fluid irNPY levels at the time of elective cesarean section also were similar. These results indicate that pregnant women have high plasma and amniotic fluid irNPY levels and that the stress of labor results in a further increase in plasma levels, suggesting a possible role of NPY in human pregnancy and parturition.\r"
