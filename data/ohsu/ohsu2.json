PF was completely aspirated from the cul-de-sac both before and after uterine irrigation. The PF was then analyzed for the presence of endometrial tissue. In native PF no significant difference in the incidence of endometrial tissue between patients with (19%) and without (11%) endometriosis (P = 0.6) was observed. Refluxed PF, obtained after uterine irrigation, showed a significantly higher incidence of endometrial tissue in women with endometriosis (76%) as compared to controls (42%) (P = 0.03). We propose two models to explain the development of endometriosis. These are not mutually exclusive, may be independent of each other, and may represent two distinct pathophysiologic disease processes.\r"

  ".W": "The severity of the symptoms of endometriosis has not always correlated well with the anatomic severity of the disease. This lack of correlation may be due to variations in the metabolic activity of the endometriotic implants present at different stages of the disease. Because prostaglandin F (PGF) has been implicated as a hormonal mediator of the clinical symptoms of endometriosis, PGF synthesis and content was measured in implants from 14 patients with mild, moderate, severe, or extensive disease. To assess whether PGF production was related to the status of implants, the authors classified implants, based on gross and histologic criteria, as petechial or reddish; intermediate or brown; or powder-burn or black. PGF production of implants from patients with mild or moderate disease was greater than that of implants from patients with severe or extensive disease (P less than 0.05), and PGF content was similar for all stages of endometriosis. Petechial implants produced twice the amount of PGF than intermediate implants (P less than 0.05), which in turn produced more PGF than powder-burn implants (P less than 0.05). Powder-burn implants did not have the in vitro capacity to produce PGF, and the amount of PGF contained in implants of all classes was similar. Therefore, endometriotic implant PGF production and possibly other biochemical activities are dependent on the physical status of the implant. The classification of implants by morphologic appearance may afford additional assistance in determining the prognosis of the disease and in the examination of the subtle effects of the disease on symptoms.\r"

Laser CO2 microsurgical salpingostomies were performed on 76 patients between January 1979 and January 1984. All of the patients underwent a preoperative assessment, which included hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopy, to formulate a preoperative classification based on a point system. The patients were divided into four groups according to tubal damage, with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 58.3% in grade I, 36.6% in grade II, 9.5% in grade III, and 0% in grade IV. The patients were divided into four groups according to adhesions, with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 38.8% with no adhesion, 32.0% with mild adhesions, 26.6% with moderate adhesions, and 5.5% with severe adhesions. From these results, a preoperative management is proposed for patients being considered for either distal tubal microsurgery or in vitro fertilization.\r"

This was followed by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase. In the second case follicular growth was abrupted by premature LH surge. This surge was triggered by early rise of E2 level while the follicle was still small in size. In the third case luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome was diagnosed, on ultrasound examination. All of the abnormalities were repetitive.\r"

During the 6-month study period, no differences were found in fasting plasma glucose, 24-hour insulin requirements, glycated hemoglobin, free fatty acids, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio between the patients in each treatment group. Compared with the nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone and the triphasic EE2/levonorgestrel formulations, the low-dose EE2/norethindrone combination resulted in small but significant increases in plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P less than 0.01), which seemed unfavorable from a clinical point of view. Norethindrone-only treatment appeared to be an appropriate alternative to both the nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone combination and the triphasic EE2/levonorgestrel formulations.\r"

Twenty of the 34 women had prior postcoital tests consistently demonstrating less than or equal to 3 motile sperm per high-powered field (HPF). Six of those 20 conceived during IUI cycles (30.0%); 0 conceived during ICI cycles (P = 0.06, Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). The pregnancy rate per IUI cycle was 6/72 (8.3%), compared with 0/66 (0.0%) per ICI cycle, a statistically significant difference (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact chi-square test). Fourteen of 34 women had prior postcoital tests consistently demonstrating greater than or equal to 5 motile sperm per HPF. One of the 14 conceived during an IUI cycle (7.1%), and 2 conceived during ICI cycles (14.3%), a difference that was not significant. The pregnancy rate per IUI cycle was 1/42 (2.4%), compared with 2/42 (4.8%) per ICI cycle (not significant). IUI may be helpful in the management of infertility associated with relatively poor postcoital tests (less than or equal to 3 motile sperm per HPF) but not with relatively good postcoital tests (greater than or equal to 5 motile sperm per HPF).\r"

The subsequent histories of 144 women who did not return for surgery were examined, to determine whether failure to return might have screened, selectively, the women at greatest risk of regret. High levels of subsequent unwanted conception and pregnancy wastage were found in the nonreturn group. Institutional factors were often implicated in failure to return. Variables available at initial presentation are proposed to identify women who risk adverse consequences of postponed sterilization, to facilitate return without increasing regret.\r"

This suggests the occurrence of undetected ovulation. An endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge was detected in 14 of these patients. Another cohort showed evidence of early luteinization without a detected endogenous LH surge. Finally, a group without early luteinization was defined. Possible explanations for these outcomes and the implications for success of IVF-ET are discussed.\r"

This phenomenon is not demonstrable in normal spontaneous conceptions. The hCG curves of 151 singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of two, three, and four embryos therefore were compared statistically with the hCG curves of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of only one embryo. The hCG levels of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hCG levels at 7 and 8, 19 and 20, and 37 and 38 days after ET. In a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hCG levels of normal singleton IVF pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton IVF pregnancies. The observed cyclic hCG secretion may be indicative of early embryo deaths. This observation supports the contention that multiple ET results in significantly more multiple implantations than previously appreciated. Thus embryo survival in utero may represent another major contributory factor to success or failure of IVF.\r"

Ham's F-10 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) without protein supplementation supported growth of the 2-cell embryos to blastocysts. Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA), fetal cord serum (FCS), or maternal serum (MS) did not enhance or reduce the blastulation rates (medium alone, 89.4%; BSA, 86.4%; FCS, 90%; MS, 74.7%). Unsupplemented Ham's F-10 medium was found to contain three major peaks of approximately 50,000 daltons and several minor peaks, analyzed on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), suggesting the presence of protein(s) in the medium itself. The storing of medium up to 425 days at 4 degrees C affected neither the HPLC profile nor its ability to support embryo growth (blastulation rates: fresh, 84%; stored 150 to 425 days, 77.7%). The coating of surgical gloves affected embryo growth. Both talc-coated (TC) and \"talc-free,\" starch-coated (SC) surgical gloves were found to be progressively embryotoxic when they touched the medium for increasing lengths of time, compared with uncoated latex (UL) gloves and untouched control medium. Quality control of medium preparation and handling in murine embryo bioassay is reemphasized, with requirements for protein supplementation, use of fresh medium, and possible contamination with even talc-free, SC surgical gloves reevaluated.\r"

The hCG injection given to the patients 36 hours before laparoscopy caused partial desensitization of adenylate cyclase of these cells to gonadotropins. Preincubation of the cells in hormone free medium for 2 to 3 days significantly increased their cAMP responsiveness to hCG. P production was stimulated initially by hCG and showed no desensitization. In the cells preincubated for 72 hours without hCG, a subsequent stimulus of 50 ng/ml of hCG elicited maximal cAMP response, whereas 1 ng/ml of hCG was sufficient to bring about maximal P secretion. Time-course studies indicated that maximal cAMP response to hCG was obtained in 1 to 3 hours. Both basal and hCG-stimulated P accumulation continued to rise for up to 24 hours. Preincubation of granulosa-luteal cells from hyperstimulated follicles improves the cells' cAMP responsiveness to hCG, whereas P response remains unaltered.\r"

Some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery. The authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens. To ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis, unilateral anastomosis was done primarily. In a few cases, cross-over anastomosis was necessary. In cases of reoperation, if possible, this was performed on the same side. When the epididymal duct system was found empty, the contralateral epididymis was explored. Patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation. From 1980 to 1984, 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy. At follow-up evaluation, 35 (85%) presented sperms in repeated tests. Fifteen of these patients (37%) have fathered children. Patients with postoperative normospermia and no antisperm antibodies had an excellent fertility prognosis. The single-loop dissection technique provides anatomic specificity and a high percentage of patent anastomoses and does not interfere with the possibilities of reoperation.\r"

Semen or migrated sperm fractions were incubated with of 1 mmol of calcium, 5 mmol magnesium, and 10 mmol of creatine phosphate (n = 28) or in the presence of 4 mumol of Verapamil, calcium, and creatine phosphate (n = 10). The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level. Thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.\r"

Ten more rats had implants that were left untreated. The results were compared with those of ten rats that had sham surgery with implantation of fat in the uterine mesenteries. Reproductive performance was better in control animals with sham surgery than in animals with endometrial implants. Maximum restoration of fertility was achieved with indomethacin. Microsurgery and danazol therapy both were effective in preventing residual endometriosis, but the animals tended to be less fertile after treatment. Adhesions were most pronounced after diathermy and least pronounced after microsurgery or indomethacin therapy. In rats treated with indomethacin, persistent endometriotic cysts were invariably smaller near the site of intraperitoneal injection: this suggests a local antiprostaglandin effect.\r"

Comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of these localization studies with the ultimate diagnoses in this group of virilized women showed that: endocrinologic suppression/stimulation studies are of limited value in tumor localization and helpful only in patients with steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies; both selective catheterization and CT scanning may provide spurious localization data; and NP-59 scintigraphy, by depicting both the anatomic localization and functional androgen hypersecretion, may provide the most significant localization data in the evaluation of patients with virilizing syndromes.\r"

The overall mean duration of infertility for these women was 5.68 +/- 0.33 years (mean +/- standard error) and their mean age was 30.20 +/- 0.46 years. Fifty-two of these women had primary infertility. Three treatment protocols were evaluated. Twenty-five women with unexplained infertility (Group A) received low-dose bromocriptine (1.25 to 2.5 mg) at bedtime for the first 18 days of the cycle; 18 women with unexplained infertility (group B) received 100 mg of pyridoxine continuously; and 16 women receiving clomiphene citrate (group C) also received bromocriptine in a manner similar to that for group A. All subjects were followed for six treatment cycles or until pregnancy occurred. The estimated cumulative pregnancy rate after six treatment cycles was 65% for groups A and C, which is significantly higher than the 22% rate for group B (Lee-Desu statistic = 4.66, P = 0.03). Women treated with bromocriptine were 2.3 times more likely to conceive than women treated with pyridoxine. Furthermore, those infertile galactorrheic women whose random prolactin level was greater than or equal to 15 ng/ml were most likely to conceive. Expressible galactorrhea in women with unexplained infertility and high normal prolactin concentrations may serve as a clinical sign indicating those women who may benefit from low-dose bromocriptine treatment administered at bedtime.\r"

The dose of norethindrone required to elicit secretory phase activity was about 0.35 mg/day.

No antibodies against endometrial glycoproteins or against \"progestin dependent endometrial protein\" (PEP) were found in any serum or peritoneal fluid sample. Levels of PEP were not different in serum from women with moderate to severe endometriosis (n = 6), with mild endometriosis (n = 21), or from disease-free cycling controls (n = 19). PEP levels in peritoneal fluid from mild endometriosis and from controls did not differ but were elevated ten times in fluid obtained in the secretory phase from women with moderate to severe disease. This suggests that PEP levels in peritoneal fluid reflect the extent of ectopic endometrial growth. The salient finding was a heretofore undescribed protein (mol wt 70,000) in secretory phase peritoneal fluid samples (18/20) and its absence during the proliferative phase (0/35).\r"

Eleven of 24 (45.8%) women attempting conception following conservative laparoscopic removal of an ectopic gestation from the sole remaining fallopian tube established an intrauterine pregnancy. In this same group, seven patients (29.2%) had a second ectopic pregnancy. The fertility results were also analyzed according to the previous history. The postoperative intrauterine pregnancy rate was 85.5% among 62 patients without a history of infertility (group I), compared with 41.1% among 56 patients with a history of infertility or a previous ectopic pregnancy (group II). The subsequent ectopic pregnancy rate in group I was 16.1% versus 28.6% in group II. This large series clearly demonstrates the relative safety and efficacy of conservative laparoscopic treatment of tubal pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated certain histochemical tests for their ability to detect premalignant mucosa in the dimethylhydrazine model of colonic carcinogenesis. Biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure, rectum, and any visualized tumors were taken. The specimens were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to detect neutral mucins, high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins, fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin, and fluoresceinated Ulex europeus agglutinin. None of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa. However, Ulex europeus agglutinin, which bound to only 3% of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study, bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals, reaching a maximum of 90% positivity by 13-16 wk. Moreover, Ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93% of tumors. Mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum (but not the splenic flexure) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals, but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia. We conclude that Ulex europeus agglutinin binding is a consistent feature of premalignant colonic mucosa in dimethylhydrazine-treated rats.\r"

Results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male F344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, or Mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation. Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation. It is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans.\r"

Of 128 isolates, multiple serotypes were defined and all were biochemically typical for Yersinia enterocolitica. Other agents were seen in 20 patients; of these, seven were Yersinia fredriksenii and six were Clostridium difficile. Diarrhea (80%) and abdominal pain (64%) were common, whereas other features such as fever (9%) and bloody stools (8%) were unusual. Use of antibiotics (24%) or opiates (28%) in the month before culture was common. The terminal ileum was seen radiographically in 20 patients, but only two barium studies showed abnormalities. Fiberoptic endoscopy and biopsy studies, done in greater than 50% of the cases, showed minimal or no changes in most patients. However, 3 patients had pseudomembranous colitis with concomitant Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and 7 had diffuse severe colitis. New culture techniques, and possibly geographic differences, have contributed to the high isolation rates of this organism. Yersinia enterocolitica occurs sporadically, involves a variety of serotypes, and is associated with a broader clinical spectrum than was formerly appreciated.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity of the endoscopic and radiologic examinations for Barrett's esophagus were prospectively evaluated. Endoscopy (92%) was significantly more sensitive than radiology (24%) in detecting Barrett's esophagus (p less than 0.001). The frequency and severity of reflux symptoms among patients determined to have Barrett's esophagus, reflux esophagitis, or normal esophageal biopsies were quantitatively similar in all three groups, except for significantly greater daytime heartburn in those with reflux esophagitis (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that Barrett's esophagus complicates gastroesophageal reflux more often than previously believed.\r"

Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity was measured in gastric and duodenal aspirates from 5 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency secondary to alcoholism and in aspirates from 5 alcoholics without evidence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (controls). Samples were collected under fasting and postprandial conditions. All patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency had nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in gastric and duodenal aspirates. Lipolytic activity in gastric aspirates was not significantly different between the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the controls during the fasting and postprandial periods. Pancreatic insufficiency was associated with significantly (p less than 0.05) higher nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in the duodenum under fasting conditions. No significant difference between the groups was found in postprandial nonpancreatic lipolytic activity. Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity accounted for approximately 90% of total lipolytic activity at the ligament of Treitz in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as opposed to 7% in the control subjects. These observations suggest a significant role for nonpancreatic lipolytic activity (lingual lipase and gastric lipase) in fat digestion in patients with pancreatic insufficiency secondary to chronic alcohol abuse.\r"

In this report, we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100% ethanol. There was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron. Capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa. Pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine, 30 mg/100 g, or intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.5 mg/100 g, significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended. Pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.2 mg/100 g, afforded no significant protection. We conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100% ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa, and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine, or with a large dose of prostaglandin F2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if hiatus hernia (HH) contributes to the delayed clearance of acid from the esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), we performed simultaneous esophageal pH recordings and radionuclide studies in three study populations: 12 GER patients with HH, 5 GER patients with no HH, and 8 subjects with HH but no GER symptoms. Acid clearance was measured at 5 cm. above the manometrically located lower esophageal sphincter (LES) after injecting a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 15 cm. above the LES. The acid was labeled with 200 mu Ci of 99mTc-sulfur colloid. Acid clearance was also measured at 10 cm. above the LES after injection of a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 20 cm. above the LES. Acid clearance at 5 cm. above the LES was faster in GER patients with no HH compared to GER patients with HH and asymptomatic HH subjects. Acid clearance was faster at 10 cm. than 5 cm. above the LES in all HH and non-HH subjects studied. In non-HH subjects, each swallow resulted in an increase in pH (a monophasic pH response) at 5 and 10 cm. above the LES. In symptomatic as well as asymptomatic HH subjects, swallows resulted in an initial fall followed by a rise in pH at 5 cm. above the LES (a biphasic pH response). Radionuclide studies showed reflux of the isotope-labeled acid into the esophagus followed by clearance (a biphasic response) accompanying swallows in 15 of the 20 HH subjects. Swallow-induced reflux was not detected by radionuclide scanning in non-HH subjects. Based on these observations, we conclude that during acid clearance a small amount of acid is trapped in the HH sac and refluxes into the esophagus during subsequent swallows when there is relaxation of the LES, and these repeated episodes of acid reflux from the HH account for the delayed acid clearance observed in GER patients with HH.\r"

Three hydrolysates of egg white and an equivalent amino acid mixture were perfused at 30 mmol/L and 100 mmol/L in two separate experiments. Two hydrolysates (OH1 and OH2) contained mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, whereas the third (OH3) comprised tripeptide to pentapeptides as judged chromatographically. Nitrogen absorption was significantly slower from the higher chain length mixture, OH3, than from the short chain mixtures, OH1 and OH2, at both concentrations. Similarly, several amino acid residues were absorbed less well from OH3 than from OH1 and OH2. These data demonstrate that the chain length of heterogeneous mixtures of peptides affects absorption of nitrogen and individual amino acid residues, and suggest that brush border hydrolysis of tetrapeptides and pentapeptides limits absorption from enzymic hydrolysates of protein which simulate the composition of the postprandial luminal contents.\r"

The alpha-epitope was localized to the pepsin region of the molecules. The two major alpha-PG I isozymogens (Pg 3 alpha and Pg 5 alpha) and the major beta-PG I isozymogen (Pg 4 beta) were demonstrated to contain net charge differences located in the respective pepsin and activation peptide regions.

  ".W": "We studied radiolabeled fecal bile acid excretion in 11 normal subjects and 17 patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea for three major purposes: to establish normal values for this test in the presence of increased stool volumes (induced in normal subjects by ingestion of poorly absorbable solutions); to test for bile acid malabsorption in the patients and to correlate this with an independent test of ileal function, the Schilling test; and to compare the results of the bile acid excretion test with the subsequent effect of a bile acid binding agent (cholestyramine) on stool weight. In normal subjects fecal excretion of the radiolabel was increased with increasing stool volumes. As a group, patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea excreted radiolabeled bile acid more rapidly than normal subjects with induced diarrhea (t1/2 56 +/- 8 vs. 236 +/- 60 h, respectively, p less than 0.005). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between t1/2 of radiolabeled bile acid and Schilling test results in these patients. Although 14 of 17 patients absorbed labeled taurocholic acid less well than any of the normal subjects with comparable volumes of induced diarrhea, cholestyramine had no statistically significant effect on stool weight in the patient group, and in none of the patients was stool weight reduced to within the normal range. In summary, most patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea have bile acid malabsorption (as measured by fecal excretion of labeled bile acid), but they do not respond to cholestyramine therapy with a significant reduction in stool weight. Although the significance of these findings was not clearly established, the most likely interpretation is that bile acid malabsorption is a manifestation of an underlying intestinal motility or absorptive defect rather than the primary cause of diarrhea.\r"

Cisapride (5 mg) was given intravenously 15 min before ingestion of a 400-kcal test meal and 10 indigestible solid radiopaque markers. On separate days and in random order each patient also received intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) or placebo 15 min before ingestion of the meal and markers. Mean gastric emptying of radiopaque markers, assessed by serial radiographs of the gastric region, was accelerated by metoclopramide and cisapride, but the difference reached significance only with cisapride (p less than 0.05). There was considerable intersubject variability in gastric emptying responses to cisapride and metoclopramide. No side effects occurred with either drug. This study indicates that acute, intravenous administration of cisapride accelerates gastric emptying of indigestible solids in patients with diabetic gastroparesis.\r"

These regional differences were used to characterize pharmacologically CCK receptors on smooth muscle cells and neurons of the gastric fundus, gallbladder, and ileum of the guinea pig. In circular and longitudinal ileal smooth muscle, tetrodotoxin was used to separate direct from neurally mediated contractile effects. Cholecystokinin receptors on smooth muscle cells were found in all locations. The muscle cells displayed a decreasing order of sensitivity to the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin as expressed in the median doses, and to the selective cholecystokinin antagonist, proglumide, as expressed in the inhibitory dissociation constants. The median doses of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ranged from 5.5 nM in gallbladder muscle to 185 nM in circular ileal muscle; the corresponding inhibitory dissociation constants of proglumide ranged from 180 to 437 microM [corrected]. Cholecystokinin receptors on cholinergic neurons were confined to circular and longitudinal ileal muscle; the neurons were 80-300 times more sensitive to the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (D50's 0.5 and 2.3 nM) than the corresponding muscle cells, and 19-21 times more sensitive to proglumide (inhibitory dissociation constants, 20 microM [corrected]). The results provide clear evidence of cellular heterogeneity of cholecystokinin receptors (i.e., difference in sensitivity between muscle cells and neurons from the same location) as well as regional heterogeneity (i.e., difference in sensitivity between muscle cells from various locations).\r"

Systemic plasma levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced, whereas those of androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol were significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated in men with alcoholic cirrhosis when compared to controls. Sex hormone binding globulin levels were also significantly elevated (p less than 0.01). The hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the degree of liver function impairment as shown by the linear significant relationship between their hepatic extractions and that of indocyanine green (r = 0.74-0.92, p less than 0.05; except for dihydrotestosterone, r = 0.17, not significant). In addition, the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the binding affinity to sex hormone binding globulin. The higher the affinity for sex hormone binding globulin, the lower the hepatic uptake influenced by liver function impairment. It was estimated that hepatic clearances accounted for only 20%-50% of the metabolic clearance of sex steroids. No significant relationship between plasma levels of sex steroids and their hepatic clearance was found. We show here that in alcoholic cirrhosis the extent of hepatic uptake of sex steroids depends partly on the degree of liver function impairment and partly on the degree to which they are bound to sex hormone binding globulin. Production rate or peripheral metabolism, or both, rather than hepatic uptake alone may account for the altered circulating levels of sex steroids.\r"

Cirrhotic patients were categorized into two groups, with and without \"hepatitis\" using a criteria to define \"hepatitis\" that included only degrees of inflammation, necrosis, and Mallory bodies that had a prognostic weight in terms of mortality in 1 yr. This classification resulted in a sharp separation between a group of 42 patients with cirrhosis without \"hepatitis\" and with low mortality, both at 1 yr (7.1% +/- 4.0%) and at 5 yr (31% +/- 7%), and another group of 98 patients with cirrhosis and \"hepatitis\" and a high mortality both at 1 yr (26.5% +/- 4.5%, p less than 0.01), and at 5 yr (47% +/- 5%, p less than 0.02). Importantly, the 1-yr mortality in patients with cirrhosis and no \"hepatitis\" was not statistically different from that of patients with no cirrhosis or \"hepatitis\" (most of whom had only fatty liver) both at 1 yr (6.9% +/- 3.3%) and at 5 yr (24% +/- 6%). There were marked differences in several variables between cirrhosis with and without \"hepatitis\" [combined clinical and laboratory index: no \"hepatitis\": 4.9 +/- 0.7, with \"hepatitis\": 7.8 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01; score of collagen in space of Disse: no \"hepatitis\": 2.1 +/- 0.4, with \"hepatitis\": 3.7 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.01; hepatocyte cross-sectional surface area: no \"hepatitis\": 682 +/- 51 micron 2, with \"hepatitis\": 841 +/- 31 micron 2, p less than 0.01]. These findings were more severe in the transjugular group than in the percutaneous group. Collagen in the space of Disse and hepatocyte surface area were not statistically different when cirrhosis without \"hepatitis\" was compared with a similar no \"hepatitis\" group of patients having noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. In this patient sample the presence of parenchymal nodules and fibrous septa, per se, did not result in an increase in mortality with respect to alcoholic patients without cirrhosis and with no \"hepatitis.\"\r"

Selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease. Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment. Remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). Major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment (59% vs. 29%, p less than 0.05). We conclude that 50% of patients who enter remission during initial therapy may ultimately achieve a sustained remission, especially if their disease is of short duration and adequately suppressed during treatment. Relapse does not affect long-term prognosis, but retreatment is associated with more side effects.\r"

Evidence for the presence of estrogen and androgen receptors was made apparent by high concentrations of silver grains over the nuclei of the cells of these tissues. Androgen receptors were largely confined to the nuclei of the smooth muscle cells of the tunica muscularis of the gut wall and the connective tissue interstitial cells of the liver, pancreas, stomach, and intestines. Estrogen receptors were prominent in the nuclei of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the liver, pancreas, gut, and the majority of the endocrine islet cells. These observations suggest that a variety of different cell types of the liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract contain estrogen and androgen receptors that might modulate their cellular activities and influence several different physiologic processes.\r"

Three sets of distinctive markers were ingested by 24 healthy persons on 3 successive days. In the first part of the study, daily abdominal x-rays were taken and individual stools were collected for radiography. Mouth-to-anus transits were assessed from the fecal output of markers and mean colonic and segmental colonic transits were calculated from the daily radiographs. These established methods were then compared with estimates of total colonic and segmental transits based on a single abdominal film, taken on the fourth day. The single-film technique correlated well with values obtained from the previous, but more inconvenient, methods. Using the simpler approach, colonic transit was assessed in 49 additional healthy subjects, for a total group of 73. Total colonic transit was 35.0 +/- 2.1 h (mean +/- SE); segmental transits was 11.3 +/- 1.1 h for the right colon, 11.4 +/- 1.4 h for the left colon, and 12.4 +/- 1.1 h for the rectosigmoid. Men had significantly shorter transits for the whole colon than did women (p less than 0.05), and this difference was apparent to some extent in the right (p = 0.06) and left colon (p = 0.07) but not in the rectosigmoid. Age did not influence transit significantly nor did a small dose of supplemental fiber. The technique is simple, convenient for clinical usage, and reduces the exposure to radiation to acceptable levels. There should be a role for this approach in the evaluation of colonic transit in selected patients.\r"

Organ blood flow was determined in conscious animals by radiolabeled microspheres before and after cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthetase inhibition. Colonic blood flow was twofold higher in colitis than in control animals. Thromboxane synthetase inhibition with dazoxiben caused a slight further increase of colon perfusion in animals with colitis, but thromboxane receptor blockade had no effect. Prostaglandin inhibition with indomethacin and ibuprofen did not affect blood flow in controls, but in animals with colitis these drugs markedly reduced colonic blood flow to the level of control animals.

To determine when M cells first appear, when they first transport reovirus, and if reovirus adheres to and is endocytosed by other epithelial cells in the first postnatal week, we examined neonatal mouse intestine by transmission electron microscopy after reovirus type 1 exposure. At 2 days M cells accounted for 0.9% of dome epithelial cells. By 9 days M cells had increased to 7.4%. Reovirus type 1 adherence to the surface of villus and dome epithelial cells showed marked variation in 2-6-day-old animals, but by 7 days only a few absorptive cell profiles had adherent reovirus. Adherence to greater than 50% of M-cell profiles occurred in all but 2 animals, but adherence to the majority of Peyer's patch absorptive cell profiles was present only in some 4- and 5-day-old animals. Adherence to a majority of undifferentiated cell profiles occurred in some animals at all ages. Membranous epithelial cells endocytosed reovirus at all ages but only at 2 days did rare villus and dome absorptive cells endocytose reovirus into the apical cytoplasm. Thus, adherence of reovirus to the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells is nonselective in newborn mice but becomes more selective within the first postnatal week with adherence by day 7 to most M-cell profiles, to a substantial but variable number of undifferentiated cell profiles, but to few absorptive cell profiles.\r"

An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness. Running spectral analysis revealed a close correspondence over time between tachygastria and reports of symptoms of motion sickness.\r"

However, increased bone density on CT may not distinguish osteoporotic fractures from neoplastic disease, in which case radioiodine scan, bone and marrow biopsies, or myelography may be necessary. Surgery for painful osteoarthritic spinal disease is controversial. The potential advantages of surgery must be weighted against the risk of anesthesia, the length and tolerance of postoperative immobility, and the effect of laminectomy and fusion on the biomechanics of the spine. Furthermore, the elderly are at increased risk for postoperative complications.\r"

We studied oesophageal motor activity in 30 consecutive patients meeting standard diagnostic criteria for primary anorexia nervosa (Feighner et al; DSM III). Seven were found to suffer from achalasia instead of primary anorexia nervosa, one from diffuse oesophageal spasm and one from severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and upper oesophageal sphincter hypertonicity, while partly non-propulsive and repetitive high amplitude, long duration contractions prevailed in the lower oesophagus of another six. In four patients with oesophageal dysmotility not responding to therapy and in 12 of 15 patients with normal oesophageal manometry, gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied. Emptying was normal in only three but markedly delayed in 13 cases (half emptying times 97-330 min, median: 147 min, as compared with 21-119 min, median: 47 min, in 24 healthy controls). In eight patients, the effects of domperidone 10 mg iv and placebo were compared under random double blind conditions. Half emptying times were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01) by domperidone. Conclusions: symptoms of disordered upper gastrointestinal motor activity may be mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa; clinical evaluation of patients with presumed primary anorexia nervosa should rule out the possibility that disordered oesophageal motor activity underlies the symptoms; delayed gastric emptying is a frequent feature in primary anorexia nervosa and might be returned to normal with domperidone.\r"

Ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring showed clearly abnormal reflux in 11 of 22 patients (50%). Nine patients had macroscopic endoscopic changes and a further 11 biopsy changes alone, of oesophagitis which was thus present in 80% overall. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly less in irritable bowel patients than in age and sex matched controls, but upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was comparable in the two groups and disordered peristalsis was not found. Oesophageal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome are mainly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux predisposed to by a subnormal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, rather than by oesophageal spasm.\r"

Cimetidine and ranitidine at 320 and 1000 micrograms/ml inhibited ACTH-stimulated corticosterone and cortisol synthesis and cimetidine decreased basal cortisol synthesis. The inhibitory effects of cimetidine on cortisol synthesis were approximately 10 times greater than those of ranitidine. Cimetidine (1000 micrograms/ml), but not ranitidine increased deoxycorticosterone synthesis by ACTH-stimulated cells, indicating inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylation in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway. Although doses of cimetidine and ranitidine which produce these in vitro effects are much greater than plasma concentrations in normal clinical use, they might be important in acutely ill patients given intravenous bolus injections of cimetidine, or if either antagonist were accumulated by the adrenal to produce high intracellular concentrations.\r"

Gastric acid secretion was measured from gastric aspirates corrected for recovery, and jejunal absorption was determined using a triple lumen perfusion technique. Sham feeding induced a significant increase in gastric acid secretion from 1.29 to 7.73 mmol/h (p less than 0.02). Jejunal absorption of water decreased significantly from 41.0 to 26.8 ml/30cm/h (p less than 0.02), sodium from 2.60 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.05, and chloride from 2.68 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.02). During the hour after sham feeding gastric acid secretion and jejunal absorption returned towards basal values. These results suggest that vagal stimulation may have influenced jejunal absorption of salt and water in man and supports the possibility that the autonomic nervous system has a physiological role in the control of intestinal mucosal function.\r"

Significant hydrogen production (greater than or equal to 20 ppm rise of breath hydrogen) was found after challenge with 10% solutions of 50, 37.5, 25, 20, and 15 g fructose in eight, seven, five, four and one subjects, respectively. One subject showed malabsorption after a 10 g dose and possibly also 5 g fructose. In contrast, no malabsorption could be detected in any of the 10 subjects after ingestion of 100 g, 75 g, or 50 g sucrose or a mixture of 50 g glucose and 50 g fructose. After ingestion of mixtures of 50 g fructose +25 g glucose and 50 g fructose +12.5 g glucose malabsorption was present in three and seven subjects, respectively. Symptoms during all challenges were mild, or absent. It is concluded that in the healthy state the absorption capacity of fructose given alone ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g. The absorption capacity of fructose given as sucrose is much higher. Glucose stimulates fructose uptake in a dose dependent fashion. The possible existence of more than one intestinal transport system for fructose is considered. The elucidation of the clinical relevance of the findings is important.\r"

In these patients, we observed an endoscopic aspect, consisting of multiple small erythematous areas, outlined by a subtle yellowish network (resembling a mosaic), mainly located in the proximal part of the stomach. We tested the value of this sign by comparing two groups: 100 patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, and 300 control patients without signs of liver disease or portal hypertension. This endoscopic pattern was observed in 94 of the patients with cirrhosis, whereas oesophageal varices were seen in 78 only. In contrast, only one patient of the control group had this aspect. Moreover, this sign was also found in seven of eight patients with non cirrhotic portal hypertension, but was seen neither in 100 patients with chronic alcoholism but without liver disease, nor in 10 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts. These endoscopic changes might be because of mucosal and/or submucosal oedema and congestion highlighting the normal areae gastricae pattern and related to raised portal pressure. We conclude that the mosaic pattern of the gastric mucosa is a sensible and specific sign for diagnosis of portal hypertension, whatever the cause.\r"

In patients of group A, cardiac index was significantly lower than that of group C and systemic vascular resistance was higher, but not significantly so, than that of patients with liver failure. Wedged hepatic venous pressure was significantly lower in the former group than in the latter. In patients in group B, corresponding values fell between those of groups A and C. Azygos blood flow averaged 0.477 +/- 0.242 l/min (mean +/- SD) in group A and it was significantly lower than in groups B and C (0.642 +/- 0.224 and 1.061 +/- 0.476 l/min, respectively). In the three groups, acute administration of propranolol induced statistically significant changes in systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics. In patients of group C but not of group B, the mean value of azygos blood flow after propranolol remained significantly higher than in group A. Moreover, the fraction of azygos blood flow to cardiac output decreased in groups A and B while slightly increased in group C. This study shows that in patients with cirrhosis, the degree of liver failure may be a determinant for the haemodynamic responses to drugs acting on portal hypertension.\r"

The extent of the acid secreting areas was examined by the endoscopic Congo red methylene blue test. Using the extent of acid secreting areas gastric ulcers were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. Duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers, and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo, but not of the gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but has little or no influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers associated with low acid secretion.\r"

It could be demonstrated, that patients treated chronically by conventional hemodialysis experience six times more febrile episodes than patients on chronic hemofiltration (4.84% versus 0.81%). Since many of the increased temperatures could not be explained by conventional means, it has to be assumed that the treatment itself caused the fever, possibly activating the monocyte hormone interleukin 1. It is of further note that there was no difference in the magnitude of the temperature due to septicaemia or to no obvious cause. This finding necessitates in our opinion an early antibiotic therapy in those cases where fever develops without clear explanation.\r"

In the third case, CAVU was successfully utilized to mobilize fluid in a patient refractory to conventional diuretic regimens. We conclude that CAVU may constitute an appropriate alternative to traditional hemodialysis in patients with advanced liver disease and renal functional impairment.\r"

Other areas reviewed included artificial cells containing enzymes, multienzymes, immunosorbents, cell cultures and other areas. Artificial cells can be formed as membrane coated adsorbent or microencapsulated adsorbent, enzymes and cells. The large surface to volume relationship and the ultrathin membrane of artificial cells allows the rapid equilibration of metabolites. Artificial cells containing enzymes, ion exchange resin and activated charcoal have been used for hemoperfusion. The microencapsulated or membrane coated absorbents, enzymes, cells, immunosorbents and other material are prevented from releasing unwanted material into the circulation and prevented from adverse effects on blood cells. Because of the problem of charcoal in releasing emboli and depleting platelets we first developed coated activated charcoal hemoperfusion for clinical application. This has been used extensively in clinical studies. The artificial cell approach has also been applied to a number of other hemoperfusion approaches. The lack of space only allows this paper to summarize some of the approaches originated from this research centre.\r"

First, a structural model with mathematical description of the different diffusion steps was developed. Exact quantification appeared very difficult, resulting in insufficient fit of predicted and measured concentration curves. Moreover, the mathematics turned out simple, since the concentration courses could be described with one exponential power. Therefore, a formal model was developed, assuming linear isotherms and adsorption, proportional to the average concentration in the column. With this model predicted in-vitro inlet and outlet concentrations could be fitted to the measured data accurately. A relation between both models is given under the condition of high intraparticle mass transfer, which is allowed in case of powder adsorbents. It can be concluded that structural models do not yield predictive tools for optimization of device geometry. A formal model with two constants determining device performance enables device optimization with the help of some in-vitro experiments.\r"

Limitations of plasma exchange, however, exist. Membrane plasma filtration provides a practical alternative. Solute removal can be made selective by the choice of operating conditions as temperature and the selection of the membrane/module design. The optimal temperature range is a function of the plasma type, solute concentrations and membrane system. Operation at below physiologic temperature (cryofiltration) is particularly suited for the removal of cold aggregative solutes, while operation at near or above physiologic temperature is more suited for the separation of solutes having large size differences at normal physiologic temperature. Membrane filtration is simple and safe to perform, is more selective than plasma exchange, does not require plasma product infusion and is more versatile than selective sorption in its applications.\r"

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigation in normal humans has demonstrated reduced ventilation and ventilatory responses to chemical stimuli during sleep. Most have interpreted this to be a product of decreasing central nervous system sensitivity to the normal stimuli that maintain ventilation, whereas other factors such as increasing airflow resistance could also contribute to this reduction in respiration. To improve our understanding of these events, we measured ventilation and occlusion pressures (P0.1) during unstimulated ventilation and rebreathing-induced hypercapnia during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Eighteen subjects (10 males and 8 females) of whom seven were snorers (5 males and 2 females) were studied. Ventilation was reduced during both NREM and REM sleep (P less than 0.05), but this decrement in minute ventilation tended to be greater in snorers than nonsnorers. Unstimulated P0.1, on the other hand, was maintained or increased during sleep in all groups studied, with males and snorers showing the largest increase. The hypercapnic ventilatory response fell during both NREM and REM sleep and tended to be lower during REM than NREM sleep. However, the P0.1 response to hypercapnia during NREM sleep was well maintained at the waking level although the REM response was statistically reduced. These studies suggest that the mechanism of the reduction in ventilation and the hypercapnic ventilatory response seen during sleep, particularly NREM sleep, is likely to be multifactorial and not totally a product of decreasing central respiratory drive.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the source of this variability and to determine which ordering principles remained operative in REM sleep. In unrestrained, naturally sleeping cats we recorded the electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, neck electromyogram, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) and computed its moving average (MAdi). As a reference, we first examined MAdi during \"tonic\" REMS, since breathing is fairly regular in this state. \"Control\" ranges for peak amplitude (PEMG), inspiratory time (TI), duration of postinspiratory inspiratory activity, expiratory time, and the calculated inspiratory slope (PEMG/TI) were determined by overlaying individual breath traces of the time course of MAdi during tonic REMS to form a composite tracing. Next, the time course of the EMG during individual breaths in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and a complete period of consecutive breaths in REMS (both tonic and phasic) were compared with this tonic REMS composite. The number of eye movements per breath was tabulated as an index of phasic activity. The inspiratory slopes during SWS and tonic REMS were similar. However, during phasic REMS, many breaths displayed either increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) in slope compared with the \"typical\" breaths seen in tonic REMS. The occurrence of these altered slopes increased with the frequency of phasic events. TI was inversely related to the slope of the EMG, which tended to minimize changes in PEMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lipolytic activity in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats was enhanced in response to 1 microM isoproterenol and 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP but not in adipocytes from trained SHR. Decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated (1 microM) cAMP accumulation were evident in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats but not in adipocytes from trained SHR. Basal and agonist-induced lipolysis in fat cells isolated from both normotensive rats and SHR immediately following a 60-min run was increased in both sedentary and trained rats. Adenylate cyclase activity in fat cell membranes was blunted in sedentary and trained SHR both in the absence and presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylyl imidophosphate. No apparent differences existed in antagonist affinity of binding sites for the antagonist dihydroalprenolol in normal rats or SHR. Evidence for a change in affinity of agonist isoproterenol might be indicated based on the enhanced potency of isoproterenol to stimulate lipolysis in trained normal rats. beta-Adrenergic receptor density and antagonist affinity were not different in normotensive rats and SHR in response to training. However, displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in adipocytes from SHR required greater concentrations of isoproterenol compared with adipocytes from normotensive rats, further suggestive of increased agonist affinity of binding sites in normal rats. These data suggest a postreceptor lesion of the lipolytic pathway in adipocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats, possibly at the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both total breath iEMG and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) increased, remained at a high level for a certain period of time, and then started to fall. A change in the pattern of iEMG within a breath was observed during loaded breathing. The increase in total-breath iEMG was associated mostly with an increase in iEMG3, or the last part of the EMG power within each inspiration. Similarly, the decrease in total breath iEMG was primarily due to a decrease in iEMG3. We conclude that, in sheep subjected to severe IFR loads for prolonged periods the marked increase in total-breath iEMG at the beginning of loaded breathing and the marked decrease in this iEMG at the time of decrease in Pdi are largely due to changes in iEMG that occur during the latter third of each breath. We speculate that during loaded breathing the recruitment pattern of diaphragmatic muscle fibers changes during the course of an inspiratory effort.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence in many species that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be a neurotransmitter in nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves. We have studied the effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS), exogenous VIP, and isoproterenol (Iso) on human airways in vitro. We have also studied a related peptide, peptide histidine methionine (PHM), which coexists with VIP in human airway nerves, and in separate experiments studied fragments of the VIP amino acid sequence (VIP1-10 and VIP16-28) for agonist and antagonist activity. Human airways were obtained at thoracotomy and studied in an organ bath. In bronchi EFS gave an inhibitory response that was unaltered by 10(-6) M propranolol but was blocked by tetrodotoxin, whereas in bronchioles there was little or no nonadrenergic inhibitory response. VIP, PHM, and Iso all caused dose-dependent relaxation of bronchi, VIP and PHM being approximately 50-fold more potent than Iso. VIP, but not Iso, mimicked the time course of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation. In contrast bronchioles relaxed to Iso but not to VIP or PHM. Neither propranolol nor indomethacin altered the relaxant effects of VIP or PHM, suggesting a direct effect of these peptides on airway smooth muscle. Neither of the VIP fragments showed either agonist or antagonist activity. We conclude that VIP and PHM are more potent bronchodilators of human bronchi than Iso and that the association between the relaxant effects of these peptides and nonadrenergic inhibitory responses suggests that they may be possible neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways.\r"

  ".W": "Newborn rats were maintained in an hypoxic chamber (10% O2 in N2) from the day of birth up to 2 wk of postnatal life. Body weight (BW) and nose-tail length were less in the hypoxic exposed (H) rats than in control (C) animals growing in air. Hematocrit rose from about 37% to about 51%. Oxygen consumption (VO2), measured with a manometric method, was lower in H than in C rats; the difference remained at 5-7 days even after normalization by BW. At 5-7 days ventilation, measured with an airflow plethysmograph, was much more elevated in H rats (whether breathing 10% O2 or air) than in C rats, with an increase in both tidal volume and frequency. This indicates that the biphasic ventilatory response, characterized by an initial rise and then a fall of ventilation toward normoxic values, commonly observed in newborns during acute hypoxic challenge is an immediate but only transient response. The dry lung weight-to-BW ratio and alveolar size were larger in H than in C rats. Lung volumes at 20 cmH2O were similar, despite the smaller BW of the H rats. Hence, in the rat, chronic hypoxia in the immediate postnatal period increases O2-carrying capacity, decreases metabolic demands, increases alveolar O2 availability, and promotes structural changes in the lung that protect the gas exchange area and optimize the structure-function relationship of the lung. These results may also suggest that the lung structural alterations with chronic hypoxia should not be attributed to changes in VO2 but, eventually, to the ventilatory action of the organ.\r"

Each subject (n = 6) performed a 1-min bout of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 120% of his maximum O2 uptake. Blood samples were collected at rest, immediately following the exercise bout, and at 5, 15, and 30 min postexercise. Mean (+/- SE) plasma ACTH levels increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 2.2 +/- 0.4 pmol/l at rest to 6.2 +/- 1.7 pmol/l immediately following exercise. Mean (+/- SE) plasma cortisol levels increased significantly from 0.40 +/- 0.04 mumol/l at rest to 0.52 +/- 0.04 mumol/l at 15 min postexercise. These data show that brief high-intensity exercise results in significant increases in plasma cortisol and ACTH levels. Furthermore, the temporal sequence between the two hormones suggests that the increase in plasma cortisol levels following brief high-intensity exercise is the result of ACTH-induced steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex.\r"

Total lung resistance was calculated breath by breath. The phrenic nerve was stimulated at 3, 5, 20, 70, 140, and 200 times motor threshold and the compound action potential was recorded. Stimulation of the phrenic nerve at three and five times threshold, which activated groups I, II, and a few group III fibers, had no effect on any of the variables measured. Stimulation at 20 times threshold, which activated many group III fibers and groups I and II fibers, reflexly decreased resistance. Stimulation at 70, 140, and 200 times threshold, which activated groups I-IV fibers, evoked progressively greater decreases in lung resistance. The reflex bronchodilation evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation was unaffected by propranolol or phentolamine but was abolished by atropine. We conclude that activation of groups III and IV phrenic nerve afferents reflexly decreased total lung resistance by withdrawing cholinergic tone to airway smooth muscle.\r"

LBPP and LBNP were performed with the subject in the supine position in a plastic box encasing the subject from the xiphoid process and down, thus including the splanchnic area. Central venous pressure (CVP) during supine rest was 7.5 +/- 0.5 mmHg, increasing to 13.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P less than 0.001) during LBPP and decreasing significantly at each step of LBNP to 2.0 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P less than 0.001) at 15 min of -30 +/- 2 mmHg LBNP. Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) did not change significantly in face of this large variation in CVP of 11.4 mmHg.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term anemia and subsequent retransfusion of erythrocytes on various circulatory parameters. Anemia was induced in nine healthy male subjects by repeated venesections. The stored blood was retransfused after 9 wk (range 8-11 wk). Exercise tests were performed before venesection in the control state (C), in the anemic state (A), and 48 h after retransfusion (R). Hemoglobin concentration levels were 146 +/- 10 g/l in C, 110 +/- 7 g/l in A, and 145 +/- 9 g/l in R. Maximal O2 uptake was 4.55 +/- 0.6, 3.74 +/- 0.7, and 4.45 +/- 0.6 l/min in C, A, and R, respectively. A decrease in heart rate of 7 beats/min (P less than 0.01) and in cardiac output of 2 l/min (P less than 0.05) at maximal exercise occurred in the anemic state compared with control values. These decreases were not reversed but, rather, were further accentuated after retransfusion. The adaptive response to submaximal exercise (cycling at 150-175 W) in anemia was mediated to the amount of 50% by an increase in cardiac output (mainly an increase in heart rate) and 50% was due to increased O2 extraction in the peripheral tissue. In conclusion, long-term anemia was found to decrease the heart rate and cardiac output at maximal exercise. Furthermore the close correlation between hemoglobin concentration and maximal O2 uptake in humans is confirmed.\r"

The equation is reexpressed in currently accepted terminology, and it is shown that the equation serves well as a basic model of normal walking. Employing this model to analyze VO2/step leads to the elaboration of a three-compartment model of the metabolic cost of walking. This three-compartment model provides a rational estimate of the fraction of walking's metabolic cost that powers the actual walking movement. Doubt is expressed that \"comfortable speed of walking\" is definable in energy terms. It is suggested that the requirements of maintaining balance while walking may determine both the comfortable speed of walking and the curvilinearity of the relationship between ground-speed and freely chosen step frequency of walking.\r"

Because of the cellular complexity of the airways, receptor characterization in whole tissue is unfeasible. Therefore, we utilized homogenates of disaggregated gland cells isolated from cat trachea and the muscarinic antagonist [1-3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to characterize glandular muscarinic receptors. Receptors of isolated cells were functionally intact as assessed by carbachol (10(-4) M) stimulation of O2 consumption 86 +/- 6% (+/- SE, n = 20). Stimulation was dose dependent (mean effective concentration = 3.5 microM), inhibited by atropine [dissociation constant (KD) = 4.2 nM] but not phentolamine nor propranolol. Specific binding of [3H]QNB to cell homogenates was saturable, of high affinity (KD = 36 pM) and to a single population of receptors. Maximum binding was 58 fmol/10(6) cells or about 35,000 receptors per cell. Estimated affinities for muscarinic agents were in the micromolar range for agonists and nanomolar range for antagonists. Histamine, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists did not inhibit specific binding. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors on tracheal gland cells are of high affinity and density.\r"

The lungs were initially equilibrated with 1% ethane, and then the concentration of ethane was monitored by mass spectrometry from multiple anatomic sites along the tracheobronchial tree during washout. We observed that the lung changed from a uniform distribution of ethane concentrations to a nonuniform distribution by a three-phase process. The first phase was nearly complete within the first 15 s and probably corresponds to concentration gradients being established in the central airways. During the second phase of washout, which lasted for several minutes, the concentrations in the various alveolar regions diverged. In the final phase, the regional concentrations remained at fixed ratios, and washout from all sites in the lung was at a constant fractional rate. These data are consistent with a model in which the duration of the second phase and the magnitude of the regional concentration differences established in this phase are dependent on both the magnitude of differences between regional transport paths and the nature of regional coupling by a common transport path to the airway opening.\r"

Inspiratory pressures were measured with an esophageal balloon catheter and three catheters located at different sites along the upper airway: supralaryngeal airway, oropharynx, and nasopharynx. Peak inspiratory pressure differences between catheters allowed assessment of pressure gradients across three airway segments: lungs-larynx-retroepiglottal airway (esophageal-supralaryngeal pressure), hypopharynx (supralaryngeal-oropharynx pressure), and transpalatal airway (oropharynx-nasopharynx pressure). In five patients, hypopharyngeal obstruction was present, and in four patients no hypopharyngeal obstruction existed. In these four patients the site of obstruction was located at the level of the palate. In a given subject, the site of obstruction was the same during repeated measurements. The presence or absence of hypopharyngeal narrowing during sleep was not predictable from gradients measured across different segments of the upper airway during wakefulness. We conclude that the site of physiological upper airway obstruction varies among patients with obstructive sleep apnea and is not predictable from pressure measured during wakefulness. We speculate that uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may not relieve obstructive apneas in patients with hypopharyngeal obstruction.\r"

Six men and one woman (age 23-46 yr) underwent 45 min of standing immersion to the neck preceded by 45-min standing without immersion, first dehydrated, and then 105 min later after rehydration with water. Immersion caused an isotonic expansion of the plasma volume (P less than 0.001), which occurred independently of hydration status. Suppression of PRA (P less than 0.001) and PA (P less than 0.001) during both immersions also occurred independently of hydration status. Suppression of plasma vasopressin was observed during dehydrated immersion (P less than 0.001) but not during rehydrated immersion. It is concluded that plasma tonicity is not a factor influencing PVP suppression during water immersion.\r"

In addition to standard polysomnography for sleep staging and respiratory pattern monitoring, esophageal pressure, tidal volume (VT), and airflow were measured via an esophageal catheter and pneumotachograph, respectively, with the latter attached to a tight-fitting face mask, allowing calculation of total pulmonary system resistance (Rp). During stage I/II NREM sleep minimal period breathing was evident in two of the subjects; however, in four subjects during hypoxia and/or relief from hypoxia, with and without added resistance, pronounced periodic breathing developed with waxing and waning of VT, sometimes with apneic phases. Resistive loading without hypoxia did not cause periodicity. At the nadir of periodic changes in VT, Rp was usually at its highest and there was a significant linear relationship between Rp and 1/VT, indicating the development of obstructive hypopneas. In one subject without added resistance and in the same subject and in another during resistive loading, upper airway obstruction at the nadir of the periodic fluctuations in VT was observed. We conclude that periodic breathing resulting in periodic diminution of upper airway muscle activity is associated with increased upper airway resistance that predisposes upper airways to collapse.\r"

Peak diaphragmatic activity (EMGdi) had a curvilinear relationship with TI during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that TI shortened as EMGdi decreased during the ventilatory phase (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05) and it prolonged as EMGdi increased during the occlusive phase (r = 0.89, P less than 0.02). However, EMGdi vs. TI for the occlusive phase was shifted to the right of that for the ventilatory phase, reflecting the relatively longer TI during upper airway occlusion. TI also had a linear relationship with pleural pressure (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001) that remained unchanged during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that it prolonged as negative inspiratory pressure increased. These results indicate that respiratory timing is continuously modified in patients with occlusive apnea as inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during NREM sleep and suggest that this modification is due to the net effects of changing inspiratory neural drive and afferent input predominantly from upper airway mechanoreceptors.\r"

The different modulations observed are discussed in respect to vagal components of the epithelial layer. Responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium, which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions. This prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, whereas substance P induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea. Serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations, which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists. A relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized, possibly dependent on substance P-ergic innervation. Muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses, independently on the presence of the epithelial layer. 4-Aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin, which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade. Epithelial-dependent contracting and relaxing factors are thus suggested in rat trachea.\r"

[3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown. The [14C]glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats.\r"

Airway responsiveness to antigen and histamine was characterized by the doses that increased the airflow resistance of the total respiratory system to twice the control values (ED200). Highly significant correlations were found between airway responsiveness and cutaneous responsiveness to antigen and other immunologic characteristics (e.g., IgE and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) in all dogs. In ragweed-sensitized dogs, there was an inverse correlation between immunologic responsiveness (reflected by the cutaneous response to antigen and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) and nonimmunologic responsiveness of airways (histamine ED200: r = 0.73, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.75, P less than 0.01, respectively). Antigen ED200 was also correlated with histamine release from lung after antigen inhalation (r = 0.74; P less than 0.01). We conclude that airway reactions to inhaled antigen in allergic dogs are dependent not only on immunologic factors but also on the degree of nonimmunologic airway responsiveness to histamine and that these factors are correlated inversely.\r"

Thermal insulation and energy costs of diving work were estimated. In summer, comparisons were made of subjects clad either in wet suits (protected) or in swimming trunks (unprotected), and in winter, they wore wet suits. The average Tre in unprotected divers decreased to 36.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C at the end of 1-h diving work, but in protected divers it decreased to 37.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C in 2 h in summer and to 36.9 +/- 0.1 degree C in 1.5 h in winter.

  ".W": "Several recent reports have addressed the problem of estimating the response slope from repeated measurements of paired data when both stimulus and response variables are subject to biological variability. These earlier approaches suffer from several drawbacks: useful information about the relationships between the error components in a closed-loop system is not fully utilized; the response intercept cannot be directly estimated; and the normalization procedure required in some methods may fail under certain circumstances. This paper proposes a new, general method of simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data when the errors in both variables are specifically related by the system structure. A direct extension of the least-squares approach, this method [directed least squares (DLS)] reduces to ordinary least-squares methods when either of the measured variables is error free and to the reduced-major-axis (RMA) method of Kermack and Haldane (Biometrics 37: 30-41, 1950) when the magnitudes of the normalized errors are equal. The DLS estimators are scale invariant, statistically unbiased and always assume the minimum variance. With simple modifications, the method is also applicable to paired data. If, however, the relation between error components is uncertain, then the RMA method is optimal, i.e., having the least possible asymptotic bias and variance. These results are illustrated by using various types of closed-loop respiratory response data.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously that in ovalbumin-sensitized canine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) the maximum ability to shorten is increased. This could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction. It was associated with increased velocity of shortening. We now report that, by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system, quick releases were applied to control and sensitized TSM at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction. From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening. It is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early, rapidly cycling bridges. The bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles.\r"

The locations were identified with respect to the innervation zone and the tendonous portion of the tibialis anterior muscle. Considerable modifications in the median frequency and conduction velocity parameters were noted. The highest values of the median frequency occurred at the region of the innervation zone and tendonous insertion of the muscle, and decreased proportionally with distance from these areas. The rate of change of median frequency was not effected by electrode location. Estimates of conduction velocity were most stable in a region between the distal tendon and the adjacent innervation zone. This region also provided the best linear fit when comparing conduction velocity to median frequency estimates. The implications for signal detection procedures are discussed.\r"

Authorities in favor of trunk-only bath rewarming base their proposal on the assumption that core temperature afterdrop would be minimized by preventing peripheral vasodilation when the subject's limbs are not immersed in the rewarming bath. In the present study, trunk-only and whole-body bath rewarming are compared by rewarming eight mildly hypothermic male subjects twice, once via each technique. It was concluded that trunk-only rewarming is not superior to whole-body bath rewarming as a therapy for mild immersion hypothermia, based on the findings that no significant differences existed between the two techniques, either in size or duration of core temperature afterdrop, or in rate of rewarming.\r"

Respiratory air flow, esophageal pressure, and intramuscular GG electromyograms (EMG) were recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Both tonic and phasic inspiratory GG-EMG activity was recorded in each of the infants. On occasion, no phasic GG activity could be recorded; these silent periods were unassociated with respiratory embarrassment. GG activity increased during sigh breaths. GG activity also increased when the infants spontaneously changed from oral to nasal breathing and, in two infants, with neck flexion associated with complete upper airway obstruction, suggesting that GG-EMG activity is influenced by sudden changes in upper airway resistance. During sleep, the GG-EMG activity significantly increased with 5% CO2 breathing (P less than or equal to 0.001). With nasal airway occlusion during sleep, the GG-EMG activity increased with the first occluded breath and progressively increased during the subsequent occluded breaths, indicating mechanoreceptor and suggesting chemoreceptor modulation. During nasal occlusion trials, there was a progressive increase in phasic inspiratory activity of the GG-EMG that was greater than that of the diaphragm activity (as reflected by esophageal pressure excursions). When pharyngeal airway closure occurred during a nasal occlusion trial, the negative pressure at which the pharyngeal airway closed (upper airway closing pressure) correlated with the GG-EMG activity at the time of closure, suggesting that the GG muscle contributes to maintaining pharyngeal airway patency in the micrognathic infant.\r"

Although the most common symptom is pain in the skeletal joints, no direct study of nitrogen exchange in this region has been undertaken. For this study, nitrogen tagged with radioactive 13N was prepared in a linear accelerator. Nine human subjects rebreathed this gas from a closed circuit for 30 min, then completed a 40- to 100-min washout period breathing room air. The isotope 13N was monitored continuously in the subject's knee during the entire period using positron detectors. After correction for isotope decay (half-life = 9.96 min), the concentration in most knees continued to rise for at least 30 min into the washout period. Various causes of this unexpected result are discussed, the most likely of which is an extensive redistribution of gas within avascular knee tissues.\r"

Exercise training resulted in a significant increase in the mean specific activity of cyclic AMP-PDE (pmol X min-1 X mg-1) from the whole homogenate and S48 fraction at cyclic AMP concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 microM and in the P48 fraction at 8 and 16 microM cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP-PDE kinetic plots according to Lineweaver-Burk for the calculation of Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax) were nonlinear, indicating both a low and high enzyme form. The Michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high Km form of cyclic AMP-PDE in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low Km form of the P5 particulate fraction. The Vmax of the high Km form of the P48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control. Phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals. These changes in specific activity, Michaelis constants, and Vmax of cyclic AMP-PDE from crude homogenates of isolated fat cells from exercise trained animals may account for the decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP following catecholamine stimulation of isolated fat cells from trained rats.\r"

We were interested in whether, and to what extent, Tar-Tre differences could lead to errors in arterial blood gas corrections. At control environmental temperatures (Ta) of 5 degrees C in the winter and 21 degrees C in the summer, Tar and Tre (37.1 degrees C) did not differ (P greater than 0.05). Elevating winter or summer Ta by 10-18 degrees C for 2-days or lowering summer Ta by 9 degrees C (2-days) did not change Tar or Tre (P greater than 0.05). Furthermore, elevating inspired PCO2 to 42 Torr for 15 min did not alter Tar or Tre from control (P greater than 0.05). During treadmill exercise, at 1.8 mph 5% grade, Tar and Tre did not change significantly (P greater than 0.05) from rest by 11 min of work. At 3 mph 5% grade, Tar increased progressively by 0.3 degrees C (P less than 0.05) while Tre tended to increase 0.1 degree C by 11 min. During moderate exercise at 6 mph 5% grade, Tar increased 0.9 degree C (P less than 0.05) while Tre increased 0.25 degree C (P less than 0.05). Finally, by 6 min of heavy exercise at 8 mph 20% grade, Tar increased 2 degrees C (P less than 0.05) while Tre increased 0.5 degree C (P less than 0.05). The Tar-Tre differences during the latter three work loads were statistically significant (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Edrophonium arterial concentrations and twitch tension of the anterior tibialis muscle were measured. Both the integrated and the naive model were fit to the twitch tension data using a model with a hypothetical \"effect\" compartment. The integrated model consistently fit the twitch tension data better than the naive model; the sum of squared deviations was lower by 46, 45, 87, and 69%, respectively, with the integrated model than with the naive model. Also, in contrast to the naive model, the integrated model is capable of describing the interaction of the anticholinesterase agent and the neuromuscular blocking agent when the concentration of either varies with time.\r"

This behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia, with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees C, usually to a new, steady level. Both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of N2O or N2 used. The effects of N2O on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible. There was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation, suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia. Since both gases elicited changes in behavioral thermoregulation promoting rather than opposing the onset of hypothermia, it is concluded that they may have acted to lower the level at which deep body temperature was being regulated.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary lymph drains into the thoracic duct and then into the systemic venous circulation. Since systemic venous pressure (SVP) must be overcome before pulmonary lymph can flow, variations in SVP may affect lymph flow rate and therefore the rate of fluid accumulation within the lung. The importance of this issue is evident when one considers the variety of clinical interventions that increase SVP and promote pulmonary edema formation, such as volume infusion, positive-pressure ventilation, and various vasoactive drug therapies. We recorded pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), left atrial pressure (LAP), and SVP in chronic unanesthetized sheep. Occlusion balloons were placed in the left atrium and superior vena cava to control their respective pressures. The superior vena caval occluder was placed above the azygos vein so that bronchial venous pressure would not be elevated when the balloon was inflated. Three-hour experiments were carried out at various LAP levels with and without SVP being elevated to 20 mmHg. The amount of fluid present in the lung was determined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio method. At control LAP levels, no significant difference in lung fluid accumulation could be shown between animals with control and elevated SVP levels. When LAP was elevated above control a significantly greater amount of pulmonary fluid accumulated in animals with elevated SVP levels compared with those with control SVP levels. We conclude that significant excess pulmonary edema formation will occur when SVP is elevated at pulmonary microvascular pressures not normally associated with rapid fluid accumulation.\r"

Resistive pressure-vs.-flow relationships for the relaxed respiratory system, lung, and chest wall were also determined; a linear relationship was found for the former (the total passive intrinsic resistance averaged 4.1 cmH2O X l-1 X s), whereas power functions best described the others: the pulmonary pressure-flow relationship exhibited an upward concavity, which for the chest wall presented an upward convexity. The average active elastance and resistance of the respiratory system were, respectively, 64.0 cmH2O X l-1 and 5.4 cmH2O X l-1 X s. The greater active impedance reflects pressure losses due to force-length and force-velocity properties of the inspiratory muscles and those due to distortion of the respiratory system from its relaxed configuration.\r"

To test this \"rate-of-living theory\" we examined the effect of raising energy expenditure by means of cold exposure on the longevity of rats.

They were maintained on this program until age 32 mo. The cold exposure resulted in a 44% increase in food intake (P less than 0.001). Despite their greater food intake, the cold-exposed rats' body weights were significantly lower than those of control animals from age 11 to 32 mo. The average age at death of the cold-exposed rats was 968 +/- 141 days compared with 923 +/- 159 days for the controls. The cold exposure appeared to protect against neoplasia, particularly sarcomas; only 24% of the necropsied cold-exposed rats had malignancies compared with 57% for the controls. The results of this study provide no support for the concept that increased energy expenditure decreases longevity.\r"

With intact vagi, nicotine caused a dose-dependent increase in central airway resistance (Rc) similar to the increase in peripheral airway resistance (Rp) at concentrations ranging from 4 to 64 micrograms/kg. However, the responses of both Rc and Rp fell progressively when sequential doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg were administered. With intact vagi and the administration of propranolol, there was a greater increase in Rp than in Rc at a nicotine dose of 64 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.05). With vagotomy, the responsiveness of both central and peripheral airways to nicotine decreased with doses of nicotine less than 64 micrograms/kg, but with doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg the suppressive effect of nicotine on both Rc and Rp was less than that seen with intact vagi. Under conditions in which the vagi were cut and atropine administered, the responsiveness of nicotine was even further depressed. Combinations either of atropine and chlorpheniramine or atropine and phenoxybenzamine also completely blocked reactions to nicotine. Additionally reactions to nicotine were completely blocked by hexamethonium. These results suggest that nicotine increases both Rc and Rp mainly through a vagal reflex and stimulation of the parasympathetic ganglia.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the control of human sweating, we studied six subjects during 40 min of cycle-ergometer exercise (60% maximal O2 consumption) at 22 degrees C 2 h after oral administration of placebo or nonselective beta-blockade (BB, 80 mg propranolol). Internal temperature (esophageal temperature, Tes), mean skin temperature (Tsk), local chest temperature (Tch), and local chest sweat rate (msw) were continuously recorded. The control of sweating was best described by the slope of the linear relationship between msw and Tes and the threshold Tes for the onset of sweating. The slope of the msw-Tes relationship decreased 27% (P less than 0.01), from 1.80 to 1.30 mg X cm-2 X min-1 X degree C-1 during BB. The Tes threshold for sweating (36.8 degrees C) was not altered as the result of BB. These data suggest that BB modified the control of sweating via some peripheral interaction. Since Tsk was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced during BB exercise, from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees C, we evaluated the influence of the reduction in local skin temperature (Tsk) in the altered control of sweating. Reductions in Tch accounted for only 45% of the decrease in the slope of the msw-Tes relationship during BB. Since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with BB, as estimated from the energy balance equation, was also reduced 18%, compared with control exercise, we concluded that during BB the reduction in sweating at any Tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local Tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine whether the brain can increase the number of perfused capillaries and arterioles supplying it regionally during hemorrhage. This was done using a technique to simultaneously determine total and perfused regional arteriolar and capillary morphology. Conscious Long-Evans rats served as unbled controls or were bled 65 mmHg or to 40-45 mmHg and stabilized for 30 min. Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using [14C]iodoantipyrine in half of these animals and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was injected in the other half for determination of perfused cerebral microvascular morphometric indexes. The total microvasculature was labeled postmortem via an alkaline phosphatase stain. Regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased in animals bled to 65 mmHg. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, cerebral blood flow was reduced 50% (from 59 +/- 28 to 26 +/- 11 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, mean +/- SD) with no regional redistribution. For all treatments, total capillary density ranged from 400 to 500 capillaries/mm2, and in controls 47% were perfused. Animals bled to 65 mmHg did not mobilize their unperfused microvascular reserve even though they showed a slight tendency to do so. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, this percent increased significantly to 57% with the largest increase occurring in the pons. Approximately 51% of arterioles were perfused in controls and this was not different compared with the percent perfused during hemorrhage. Despite the overall lack of mobilization of unperfused arterioles, some regions within the brain significantly mobilized their reserves with severe hemorrhage, e.g., hippocampus (78%), hypothalamus (67%), and medulla (73%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial elasticity was evaluated by measuring the carotid to femoral pulse-wave velocity (c) at rest. The slope, S(c) of the relation between c and the diastolic blood pressure was studied during a cold pressor test to test vascular reactivity. The relationship between heart rate (HR) and work load was determined using a cycle ergometer; the variables measured were the slope of this relation S(PWC) and the power output at a HR of 170 min-1 (PWC170). The PWC170 ranged from 1.8 to 4.6 W/kg, and values of c ranged from 3.9 to 6.8 m/s. A strong inverse linear relation was found between c and PWC170 (r = -0.76), whereas the HR at rest was positively related to both c (r = 0.68) and PWC170 (r = 0.74). There was no relationship between HR at rest and the slopes S(c) and S(PWC); the latter two variables depend mainly on the sympathetic response. These results show the importance of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the cardiovascular system, particularly arterial elasticity, in human adaptations to muscular exercise.\r"

Similar density fluctuations were observed in the blood leaving isolated, perfused lobes of dogs that were ventilated cyclicly. Employing an analysis that balanced the erythrocyte and plasma flows through distensible capillaries containing blood with a tube hematocrit lower than the hematocrit in large blood vessels, we derived a relationship to estimate from the density fluctuation the change in pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc). For mechanical ventilation, the maximum change in density over one ventilation cycle increased from 0.084 +/- 0.01 to 0.47 +/- 0.05 (SE) g/l as the frequency decreased from 29 to 6 cycles/min. These density changes were estimated to be the result of an 1-16% change in Vc. A larger tidal volume for the mechanical ventilation led to a larger density fluctuation. The maximum density change of spontaneous respiration of 6 cycles/min was one-sixth of the mechanical case, indicating a much smaller change in Vc during spontaneous respiration. When the airway flow resistance was increased for spontaneous respiration, larger density fluctuations were observed.\r"

GH3 cells (10(6)) were subcutaneously injected into 150-g female Wistar-Furth rats to initiate the tumor. After 17 days, the tumor-bearing rats gained 5.7 g body wt/day compared with 2.0 for the nontumor-bearing rats. The left gastrocnemius muscle was surgically removed from both nontumor and tumor groups. The gastrocnemius was removed from the tumor group after an increased growth rate was achieved. Seven days after surgery, the animals were killed and plantaris muscles were removed. The wet weight of the left plantaris muscle increased 45.6 and 44.0% over the unoperated contralateral control (right side) in the nontumor and tumor groups, respectively. The right control plantaris muscle in the tumor group was 63% heavier than the right control plantaris from the nontumor group; however, the proportion of body weight for plantaris was similar between the two groups. The effect of gastrocnemius ablation and tumor treatment on plantaris weight was additive, and the percent increase over the unoperated contralateral control side was similar between the two groups. These data demonstrate that skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs in adult animals in which growth has been stimulated by a growth hormone-secreting tumor and could suggest that the muscle growth response caused by the tumor is operating by a mechanism different than work-induced hypertrophy.\r"

Rib cage, as well as abdominal, strapping caused a significant decrease in vital capacity (respectively, -36 and -34%), total lung capacity (TLC) (-31 and -27%), functional residual capacity (FRC) (-28 and -28%), and expiratory reserve volume (-40 and -48%) and an increase in specific airway conductance (+24 and +30%) and in maximal expiratory flow at 50% of control TLC (+47 and +42%). The decrease of residual volume (RV) was significant (-12%) with rib cage strapping only. Abdominal strapping resulted in a minor overall increase in Rrs, whereas rib cage strapping produced a more marked increase at low frequencies; thus a frequency dependence of Rrs was induced. A similar pattern, but with lower absolute values, of Rrs was obtained by thoracic strapping when the subject was breathing at control FRC. Xrs was decreased, especially at low frequencies, with abdominal strapping and even more with thoracic strapping; thus the resonant frequency of the respiratory system was shifted toward higher frequencies. Partitioning Rrs and Xrs into resistance and reactance of lungs and chest wall demonstrated that the different effects of chest wall and abdominal strapping on Rrs and Xrs reflect changes mainly of chest wall mechanics.\r"

Despite a twofold increase in percent of prelabeled saturated phosphatidylcholine secreted (P less than 0.01), the alveolar wash saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes were not different. The minimum surface tensions were 19.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.2 dyn/cm for alveolar washes from vagotomy and control rabbits, respectively (P less than 0.01). The soluble proteins from alveolar washes inhibited the surface tension lowering properties of natural surfactant, whereas those from the control rabbits did not (P less than 0.01). When vagotomy rabbits in respiratory failure were treated with 50 mg natural surfactant lipid per kilogram arterial blood gas values and compliances improved relative to control rabbits. Vagotomy results in alveolar pulmonary edema, and surfactant dysfunction despite normal surfactant pool sizes and respiratory failure. A surfactant treatment can improve the respiratory failure.\r"

Muscle fiber type proportions (I, IIa, and IIb), fiber areas and activities of several enzyme markers of different energy metabolic pathways were determined from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis. Results indicated that Caucasians had a higher percent type I (8%, P less than 0.01) and a lower percent type IIa (6.7%, P less than 0.05) fiber proportions than Africans. No significant differences were observed between the two racial groups in the type IIb fiber proportion or in the three fiber type areas. Enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic [creatine kinase (CK)] and glycolytic [hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] metabolic pathways had significantly higher activities (about 30-40%) in the Black African group than in the Caucasian group (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was noted in the activities of oxidative enzymes [malate dehydrogenase (MDH), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH)]. Consequently, the PFK/OGDH ratio was significantly elevated in Africans (P less than 0.05). The racial differences observed between Africans and Caucasians in fiber type proportion and enzyme activities of the phosphagenic and glycolytic metabolic pathways may well result from inherited variation. These data suggest that sedentary male Black individuals are, in terms of skeletal muscle characteristics, well endowed for sport events of short duration.\r"

Resting ventilation (VE) and progressive ventilatory responses to isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia were measured in six normal men. Compared with a control saline infusion given single blind on the same day, adenosine stimulated VE [mean increase: 1.3 +/- 0.8 (SD) l/min; P less than 0.02], lowered resting end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) (mean fall: -3.9 +/- 0.9 Torr), and increased heart rate (mean increase: 16.1 +/- 8.1 beats/min) without changing systemic blood pressure. Adenosine increased the hypoxic ventilatory response (control: -0.68 +/- 0.4 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1, where %SaO2 is percent of arterial O2 saturation; adenosine: -2.40 +/- 1.2 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1; P less than 0.01) measured at a mean PETCO2 of 38.3 +/- 0.6 Torr but did not alter the hypercapnic response. This differential effect suggests that adenosine may stimulate ventilation by a peripheral rather than a central action and therefore may be involved in the mechanism of peripheral chemoreception.\r"

Since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium, we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs. The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min. In 10 other dogs (group B) 0.2 mg/kg was administered. All measurements were performed during control and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after digoxin administration. In group A, digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs (1.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), whereas in group B, digoxin plasmatic level was higher (8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml). No significant change in cardiac output and Qdi was noted after administration of digoxin, either in the dogs of group A or those of group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to determine whether an impairment in diaphragmatic contractility was involved in the genesis of the diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after upper abdominal surgery. Five patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery were studied. The following measurements were performed before and 4 h after surgery: vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Diaphragmatic function was also assessed using the ratio of changes in gastric pressure (delta Pga) over changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi). Finally contractility of the diaphragm was determined by measuring the change in delta Pdi generated during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves (Pdi stim). Diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in all the patients after upper abdominal surgery as assessed by a marked decrease in delta Pga/delta Pdi from 0.480 +/- 0.040 to -0.097 +/- 0.152 (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery compared with preoperative values. VC also markedly decreased after upper abdominal surgery from 3,900 +/- 630 to 2,060 +/- 520 ml (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after upper abdominal surgery compared with the preoperative values. We conclude that contractility of the diaphragm is not altered after upper abdominal surgery, and diaphragmatic dysfunction is secondary to other mechanisms such as possible reflexes arising from the periphery (chest wall and/or peritoneum), which could inhibit the phrenic nerve output.\r"

Glucose (Glc), E2, and hGH levels were determined from serial blood samples taken from an intravenous catheter. Glc did not change significantly during exercise, but different trends for the runners (increases) vs. controls (decreases) resulted in higher (P less than 0.01) postexercise levels in the runners. Resting hGH was higher (P less than 0.05) in the FRs and FCs than the MRs and MCs, respectively, and continued to be higher in the FCs (vs. MCs) during the first 30 min of exercise. The MRs achieved higher peak hGH levels and exhibited higher values than the MCs throughout exercise and recovery. There were no statistically significant training differences in the females. The strongest predictors for peak hGH were absolute work load and group (runners vs. controls), both of which combined accounted for 32-36% of the variability (P less than 0.01) in hGH response. Significant sex-related variables (sex, resting E2) accounted for 11-19% of the variability in peak or percent change in hGH, with E2 having a positive effect at rest but a negative effect during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "When dog lung lobes were perfused at constant arterial inflow rate, occlusion of the venous outflow (VO) produced a rapid jump in venous pressure (Pv) followed by a slower rise in both arterial pressure (Pa) and Pv. During the slow rise Pa(t) and Pv(t) tended to converge and become concave upward as the volume of blood in the lungs increased. We compared the dynamic vascular volume vs. pressure curves obtained after VO with the static volume vs. pressure curves obtained by dye dilution. The slope of the static curve (the static compliance, Cst) was always larger than the slope of the dynamic curve (the dynamic compliance, Cdyn). In addition, the Cdyn decreased with increasing blood flow rate. When venous occlusion (VO) was followed after a short time interval by arterial occlusion (AO) such that the lobe was isovolumic, both Pa and Pv fell with time to a level that was below either pressure at the instant of AO. In an attempt to explain these observations a compartmental model was constructed in which the hemodynamic resistance and vascular compliance were volume dependent and the vessel walls were viscoelastic. These features of the model could account for the convergence and upward concavity of the Pa and Pv curves after VO and the pressure relaxation in the isovolumic state after AO, respectively. According to the model analysis, the difference between Cst and Cdyn and the flow dependence of Cdyn are due to wall viscosity and volume dependence of compliance, respectively. Model analysis also suggested ways of evaluating changes in the viscoelasticity of the lobar vascular bed. Hypoxic vasoconstriction that increased total vascular resistance also decreased Cst and Cdyn and appeared to increase the vessel wall viscosity.\r"

We subsequently used the relationship between costal and crural diaphragmatic length, respectively, and abdominal cross-sectional area during passive inflation-deflation to predict the length changes in the costal and crural diaphragm during quiet breathing before and after bilateral phrenicotomy. In the intact animal the inspiratory shortening in the crural diaphragm was almost invariably greater than predicted from the relationship during passive inflation. During inspiration after phrenicotomy the crural diaphragm invariably lengthened, whereas the costal diaphragm often shortened. In general there was a good correlation between the measured and predicted length change for the crural diaphragm (r = 0.72 before and 0.79 after phrenicotomy) and a poor one for the costal diaphragm (r = 0.05 before and 0.19 after phrenicotomy).\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between lung weight and lymph flow, we used an in situ, isolated sheep lung preparation that allowed these two variables to be measured simultaneously. All lungs were perfused for 4.5 h at a constant rate of 100 ml X min-1 X kg-1. In control lungs, the left atrial pressure (Pla) was kept at atmospheric pressure. In experimental lungs, Pla was kept atmospheric except for a 50-min elevation to 18 mmHg midway through the perfusion. During this period of left atrial hypertension, pulmonary arterial pressure rose from 18 to 31 mmHg, lymph flow rose from 3 to 12 ml/h, and the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio (pi L/pi P) fell from 0.7 to 0.48. After left atrial pressure was returned to control, pulmonary arterial pressure, lymph flow, and pi L/pi P all returned to control levels. The rate of weight gain after the return of left atrial pressure to control was also the same as that in the control group. However, during the period of left atrial hypertension 135 ml of fluid were filtered into the lung, and this large increase in lung weight remained after the pressure was lowered. The presence of this substantial excess lung water despite control values for vascular pressures, lymph flow, rate of weight gain, and pi L/pi P suggests that the absolute amount of lung water has little influence on the dynamic aspects of lung fluid balance. These results are consistent with a two-compartment model of the interstitial space, where only one of the compartments is readily drained by the lymphatics.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the vagi on gas transport mediated by high-frequency, low tidal volume ventilation (HFV) was examined in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, propranolol-treated dogs. Gas transport efficiency was estimated by measuring the rate of CO2 removed from the lungs (Vco2) achieved during 45-s bursts of HFV applied before (control 1), during, and after (control 2) electrical stimulation of the transected vagi. During vagal stimulation the heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing. During the 15-s phase of vagal stimulation pulmonary impedance increased from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 2.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s, and Vco2 increased. When the electrical stimulation of the vagi was stopped, impedance and Vco2 returned to prestimulation values. Vco2 was always higher during electrical stimulation of the vagi when HFV of a fixed volume was applied over a range of frequencies or when a fixed oscillation frequency was used over a range of tidal volumes. The effects of vagal stimulation on HFV-mediated gas transport were quite similar to the effects of moving the locations of the bias flow inlet and outlet into the lung such that tracheal volume was decreased by 20 ml, an amount equivalent to estimated change in control airway volume thought to occur during vagal stimulation. We simulated the effects of vagal stimulation and decreased tracheal volume on Vco2 by using a previously described model of HFV-mediated gas transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bed-rest deconditioning is suspected to reduce cardiac reserve, possibly by impairing autonomic function. Heart rate response in normal subjects reveals considerable variability, reflected by a relatively broadband interbeat interval power spectrum. A reduction in this autonomically modulated variability would be predicted to cause a narrowing of the spectrum. We retrospectively analyzed data from 10 aerobically conditioned men (age range 35-49 yr) who had undergone orthostatic tolerance testing with lower body negative pressure pre-bed rest and after 7-10 days of bed rest, while on placebo and after intravenous atropine. Spectra were derived by Fourier analysis of 128 interbeat interval data sets. Spectral power was estimated by computing the root-mean-square (rms) values (mean +/- SD) for the band encompassing the 2nd to 64th harmonics from subjects with a sufficient number of beats: placebo rms is 93 +/- 33 ms for pre-bed rest and 84 +/- 38 ms for bed rest (NS, n = 6); atropine rms is 63 +/- 24 ms for pre-bed rest and 40 +/- 23 ms for bed rest (P less than 0.01; n = 7). These data suggest that atropine \"unmasks\" a deconditioning effect of bed rest in athletic men, evidenced by a reduction in interbeat interval spectral power not apparent with placebo. Spectral analysis offers a useful means of quantitating the effects of bed-rest deconditioning and autonomic perturbations on cardiac dynamics.\r"

Isolated lungs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solutions containing no inhibitor, PD 100,000 (mol wt 100,000), PD 5,000 (mol wt 5,000), or low-molecular-weight inhibitors (Prontosil or acetazolamide). The time course of effluent perfusate pH equilibration was measured in a stop-flow pH electrode apparatus. Pulmonary CO2 excretion (Vco2) was monitored by continuously recording expired CO2 concentration. The lungs were ventilated with room air and perfused at 37 degrees C with KRB prebubbled with 5% CO2- 20% O2- 75% N2. The results obtained show that both the low-molecular-weight inhibitors and PD's caused postcapillary pH disequilibria (delta pH) in effluent perfusate. However, only acetazolamide and Prontosil caused a reduction in Vco2. These results suggest that there is an intravascular CA, presumably associated with endothelial cell membranes, that is accessible to all inhibitors used and is responsible in part for equilibration of the CO2- HCO3- -H+ reactions in the perfusate but, under the conditions used, does not affect CO2 excretion; and there is an extravascular (possibly intracellular) CA that can be inhibited by low-molecular-weight inhibitors, is primarily responsible for enhanced CO2 transfer across the alveolar-capillary barrier (perhaps via facilitation of CO2 diffusion), and is in part responsible for pH equilibration.\r"

  ".W": "Slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors have been hypothesized to be the afferents mediating the vagally dependent, volume-related prolongation of expiratory time (TE) during expiratory loading. It has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of TE is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR) activity during expiratory loading. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while PSR's were simultaneously recorded. Both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume (VE) and increased expiratory duration (TE). The TE for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent VE. Thus two different VE-TE relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads. When TE was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory, a single linear relationship was observed. PSR activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as VE decreased and TE increased. A single linear relationship resulted when the number of PSR spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated TE for all types of loads. These findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of TE with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in PSR discharge. These results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of TE is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of PSR activity during the expiratory phase.\r"

Two postures required full support of body weight by the arms: arms up, hanging from a bar, and arms down with hands gripping parallel bars. Three involved muscles that flex and extend the trunk: a partial sit-up position while supine and nearly maximal spinal extension and flexion while standing. Changes at the inspiratory and expiratory volume extremes were recognized by having the subjects do two VC efforts: the first standing and the second in the posture in question while continuing to breathe on the spirometer. Control observations in which the second of a VC pair was performed in an unstressed posture allowed correction for the influence of rebreathing. The changes in corrected VC were small, the greatest being an average reduction of approximately 8% in the partial sit-up position. During full support of body weight by the arms, the VC was slightly increased due to a significant increase in the inspiratory extreme and no change in the expiratory extreme. Spinal extension produced small increases in lung volume at both extremes with no significant change in VC, whereas spinal flexion did not influence the upper extreme but did increase lung volume at the lower extreme. The changes are discussed in terms of trunk muscle action.\r"

Fourteen healthy men were exposed to three different experimental conditions: arm immersion, body immersion, and control. The men always sat upright while both upper extremities hung vertically at their sides. During arm immersion, one forearm was completely immersed for 30 min in either cold water (28 degrees C, n = 7) or warm water (38 degrees C, n = 7). This cold-warm water protocol was repeated on separate days for exposure to the remaining conditions of body immersion (immersion of 1 forearm and all tissues below the xiphoid process) and control (no immersion). Blood samples were simultaneously drawn from cannulated veins in both antecubital fossae. Hematocrit difference (Hct diff) was measured by subtracting the nonimmersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct dry) from the immersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct wet). Hct diff was approximately zero when the men were exposed to the control condition and body immersion in warm water. In the remaining conditions, Hct wet dropped below Hct dry (P less than 0.01, 3-way analysis of variance). The decrements of Hct diff showed there were differences between venous hematocrits in immersed and nonimmersed regions of the body, indicating that changes of the whole-body hematocrit cannot be calculated from a large-vessel hematocrit soon after immersing the lower body in cold water.\r"

Diaphragmatic force output, as assessed by Pdi, followed the periodic changes in EMGdi but during the occlusive phase the increase in Pdi was more than the increase in EMGdi. This increase in Pdi was essentially due to an increase in Ppl, since Pga and EMGdi had a linear relationship (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001) that did not change during the occlusive and ventilatory phases. Abdominal muscle recruitment evident in Pga and abdominal motion tracings during the occlusive phase when paradoxical rib cage motion was observed suggested that this increase in diaphragmatic efficiency was likely due to a change in diaphragmatic length-tension characteristics. These results demonstrate that, in patients with occlusive apneas, the diaphragm is the predominant respiratory muscle during NREM sleep and that its function is supported by abdominal muscle recruitment.\r"

Weber's law predicts the delta R50 (the added load detectable on 50% of presentations) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance (R0) and thus the delta R50/R0 ratio (the Weber fraction) is constant. We have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load, we wondered if the nose might play a role in RLD. To determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in R0 in the range of normal nasal resistance (RN), we determined R0 and delta R50 using standard techniques under the following conditions: nose vs. decongested nose, nose vs. nose with added external R0 (3.0 and 8.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s), nose vs. anesthetized nose, nose vs. mouth, and mouth vs. mouth with added load (3 cmH2O X l-1 X s). We found that decongestant decreased RN [4.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) to 3.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05] and delta R50 (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05). When an external load of 3 cmH2O X l-1 X s was added to the nose, delta R50 did not change significantly (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s), but the Weber fraction decreased (0.28 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 between 35 and 40 Torr. In one group, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences. In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery. Whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control, 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia (9% O2 in N2), and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery, respectively. The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected. This suggested that the excess O2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an O2 deficit.\r"

We also assessed whether LTC4 and LTD4 increased the permeability to albumin in cultured monolayers of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In Ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs, LTC4 resulted in increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and the pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap) measured as the equilibration pressure after simultaneous pulmonary arterial and venous occlusions. Pulmonary venous resistance (Rv) increased to a greater extent than arterial resistance (Ra) in both Ringer-perfused and blood-perused lungs challenged with LTC4. The greater increase in PVR in blood-perfused lungs corresponded with a greater elevation of lung effluent thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentration. The LTC4-stimulated increase in PVR was prevented by pretreatment with meclofenamate (10(-4) M). LTD4 also induced rapid increases in Ppa and Pcap in both Ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs; however, Ppa decreased before stabilizing at a pressure higher than base line. The increases in Rv with LTD4 were greater than Ra. The LTD4-stimulated increases in Ra and Rv also paralleled the elevation in TxB2 concentration. As with LTC4, the increases in Ppa, Pcap, PVR, and TxB2 concentration were greater in blood-perfused than in Ringer-perfused lungs. Pretreatment with meclofenamate reduced the magnitude of the initial increase in Ppa, but did not prevent the response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Decreased maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system have been previously shown to occur at high altitude. We hypothesized that tachycardia mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation acted to defend VO2max at high altitude. Propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude (4,300 m) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol (80 mg three times daily) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo (lactose). Compared with sea-level values, the VO2max fell on day 2 at high altitude, but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups (26 +/- 6 vs. 32 +/- 5%, P = NS) and VO2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued. During 30 min of submaximal (80% of VO2max) exercise, propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects. The maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of O2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation, arterial O2 saturation, or hemoglobin concentration. Rather, it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the O2 uptake with each heartbeat. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal O2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.\r"

Three autologous infusions of 1 unit (U) whole blood (450 ml/U) were administered sequentially 2-7 days apart. Maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) increased from 5.04 l/min at control (C) to 5.24 l/min after 2 U (R2) and 5.38 l/min after 3 U (R3). Cardiac output during treadmill running at 91% control VO2max was 28.2 l/min at C, 29.8 l/min at R2, and 33.1 l/min at R3. Corresponding heart rates were unchanged, and stroke volume was increased at R3. Peak lactate concentration was reduced, and arterial acid-base status improved at R2 and R3 after standardized bouts of intense exercise. Arterial blood pressures and electrocardiograms during exercise were not affected by erythrocythemia. We conclude that the reinfusion of up to 3 U of autologous blood into highly trained endurance runners who have normal hematology does not adversely affect their cardiovascular response to maximal exercise. In addition, the increases in VO2max following reinfusion of 2 U, and again after 3 U, suggest that the aerobic power of the working muscles was not surpassed at these levels of erythrocythemia.\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of muscle pH (pHm) with the homogenate technique are routinely made when extensive phosphagen hydrolysis has occurred. Upon exposure of the homogenate to 37 degrees C in the pH meter, phosphocreatine and ATP were rapidly degraded to 35 and 60% of control concentrations after 30 s. Attempts at chemically arresting this hydrolysis were unsuccessful. Therefore we examined the significance of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm measurement in human biopsies taken at rest and following intense electrical stimulation. To accomplish this, pHm was measured at 0 degree C, where extensive hydrolysis did not occur. On the same homogenate, pHm was measured at 0 degree C with phosphagens and at 0 and 37 degrees C after phosphagen hydrolysis. The effect of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm at 0 degrees C was used to estimate this effect at 37 degrees C. In resting samples, phosphagen hydrolysis produced a nonsignificant acidification of 0.008 pH units and, in electrically stimulated samples, a nonsignificant alkalinization of 0.033 units. Measurements of homogenate PCO2 suggested that most of the CO2 remained in the sample during pHm measurement at 37 degrees C. The present work substantiates the use of the homogenate technique as an accurate and practical method for the estimation of intracellular pH in resting and exercise human muscle samples.\r"

  ".W": "Airflow patterns in the nasal passages influence the distribution of air-pollutant-induced lesions in the airway mucosa. Little is known about airflow characteristics of the complex nasopharyngeal airway of humans and experimental animals. Airflow characteristics in the nasopharyngeal airways of an adult male baboon (13.9 kg body wt) were investigated with thermistor probes and the findings compared with flow visualization, using a cinephotographic technique. A clear, acrylic, hollow cast of a baboon nose was made, and thermistor probes were inserted to record air velocity in the cast lumen using a wind tunnel to propel air through the cast. An identical cast was studied by passing water through the cast, with pulses of dye to reveal flow, and cinephotography was used for determination of flow velocities and flow patterns. Flow rates adjusted on the basis of a Reynolds conversion showed good correlations between the two methods, whereas cinephotography revealed areas of turbulence and vortex-like flow not detected by thermistor probes. These results suggest that water flow may provide useful information in complex airways where airflow cannot be determined by other methods.\r"

Sweat collected from upper back (UB), lower back (LB), midchest (MC), stomach (S), and thigh (T) areas as well as by whole-body washdown (W) was analyzed for urea nitrogen (N). With the exception of the L where all regional measures were similar, all sites overestimated W (several significantly, P less than 0.05). Regression analysis estimations of W (mg/h) from regional collections were as follows--L: W = 0.727 (S) - 1.366(UB) + 1.181(T) + 65.470 +/- 29.5, R = 0.90; M: W = 0.598(MC) - 0.649(UB) + 0.244(LB) + 43.238 +/- 30.4, R = 0.99; H: W = 0.274(S) - 0.560(T) + 0.223(MC) + 131.104 +/- 4.3, R = 0.99; All Intensities: W = 0.497(MC) - 0.483(T) + 0.112(LB) + 69.554 +/- 31.5, R = 0.96. W recovery of exogenous urea N applied to each subject's body was 98.3 +/- 2.7% (mean +/- SE).

Repeated W determinations by the same investigator were not different (P greater than 0.05), but intrainvestigator reliability coefficients differed widely (0.385 vs. 0.820). Together, these data indicate that W solute recovery can be high; however, both inter- and intrainvestigator reliability can vary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ejection pattern for a given cardiac output with fixed stroke volume and duration of ejection is predicted by minimizing a criterion that describes the total ventricular O2 consumption. The ejection patterns of the model closely resemble the observed ejection patterns. Also, the model predictions for changes in the values of the system parameters are qualitatively correct. The results strongly suggest that the control of ejection pattern satisfies the principle of energy cost minimization.\r"

The data did not support the published rates of success of the procedure for Stage-1 and Stage-2 lesions. With a mean length of follow-up of eighteen months, 60 per cent of the hips that had a decompression prior to collapse of the femoral head demonstrated progression of the lesion and were judged to be a failure by clinical or radiographic criteria. Computerized tomographic scans and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be 100 per cent sensitive for diagnosis in preoperative testing; isotopic bone-scanning was less sensitive (80 per cent). Functional intraoperative testing by the method of Ficat did not provide added sensitivity or specificity to the results of the preoperative bone scan. A postoperative or intraoperative fracture occurred in four hips, for an incidence that exceeded any in previously published reports. We concluded that core decompression should be considered a relatively ineffective procedure with significant morbidity.\r"

Since our method of evaluation changed in 1977, we compared the preoperative and operative diagnoses in the twenty patients who were treated surgically from 1972 through 1976 with those in the twenty patients who were so treated from 1977 through 1984. Considering all forty patients who were treated operatively, sixteen (40 per cent) had a typical Stener lesion, and in two others (5 per cent) the ulnar collateral ligament was rolled up on itself and lying beneath the adductor aponeurosis. From 1972 through 1976, stability was tested with the metacarpophalangeal joint in complete extension or in varying amounts of flexion. Of the twenty thumbs that were evaluated by this technique and were treated surgically, 20 per cent had a Stener lesion. From 1977 through 1984, stability was tested with the joint in full flexion because of the findings in anatomical studies that were completed in 1977; the incidence of a Stener lesion in the twenty thumbs that were treated by repair or reattachment of the ligament during this time was 70 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each of the eighteen compartment syndromes was documented by measurements of intracompartmental pressure that were obtained by the saline-injection technique, and all were treated by four-compartment fasciotomy. The incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted, grade-III open injury to a pedestrian. The physician must maintain a high index of suspicion to detect a compartment syndrome in the patient who has multiple trauma, as its clinical signs and symptoms may be masked by a closed injury of the head or the need for ventilatory support or prolonged anesthesia for other surgical procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to define as a distinct clinical entity the syndrome of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord with transient quadriplegia. The sensory changes include burning pain, numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation, while the motor changes range from weakness to complete paralysis. The episodes are transient and complete recovery usually occurs in ten to fifteen minutes, although in some patients gradual resolution occurs over a period of thirty-six to forty-eight hours. Except for burning paresthesia, pain in the neck is not present at the time of injury and there is complete return of motor function and full, pain-free motion of the cervical spine. In our series, routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine were negative for fractures or dislocations in all patients. However, the roentgenographic findings did include developmental spinal stenosis in seventeen patients, congenital fusion in five patients, cervical instability in four patients, and intervertebral disc disease in six patients. Spinal stenosis was determined by two different roentgenographic methods. The first was the standard method, and the second was a ratio method devised by us. Both measurements were made at the level of the third through the sixth vertebral body on a routine lateral roentgenogram of the cervical spine that was available for twenty-four of the thirty-two patients and for a control group of forty-nine male subjects of similar age who did not have any neurological complaints. Using the ratio method, a measurement of less than 0.80 indicated significant spinal stenosis in the group of twenty-four patients for whom roentgenograms were available, as compared with a ratio of approximately 1.00 or more in the control group. There was statistically significant spinal stenosis (p less than 0.0001) in all of the patients as compared with the control subjects by both methods of determining spinal stenosis. A survey of 503 schools participating in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football in the 1984 season found that 1.3 per 10,000 athletes had a history that was suggestive of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord. The phenomenon of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord occurs in individuals with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine, congenital fusion, cervical instability, or protrusion of an intervertebral disc in association with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal. We postulate that in athletes with diminution of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal the spinal cord can, on forced hyperextension or hyperflexion, be compressed, causing transitory motor and sensory manifestations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In our opinion, a myelogram should be made for patients with a history of transient quadriplegia, numbness, or a burning sensation down the back or the lower extremities, even if other radiographic studies are interpreted as negative. Patients who have stenosis of the cervical spine should be advised to discontinue participation in contact sports.\r"

In order to isolate the effects of diet on fracture-healing, we developed a method for producing a standard closed femoral fracture with minimum-soft-tissue injury. Three groups of animals were studied. Group I was a control group, in which the rats did not undergo an operation. The rats in Group II underwent intramedullary pinning of the right femur, but no fracture was created. The rats in Group III underwent pinning identical to that used for Group II, after which a closed, transverse femoral fracture was produced. Immediately after surgery, the animals in each group were subdivided into five diet-treatment subgroups. Subgroup A received a regular diet; Subgroup B received a protein-free diet; and Subgroup C received a mineral-free diet that was lacking in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D. Subgroup D received a protein-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirement of protein, and Subgroup E received a mineral-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirements of calcium and phosphorus as well as a therapeutic dose of vitamin D, equivalent to that used in the treatment of osteomalacia. At the end of five weeks, the animals were killed and the right femur of each one was subjected to torsion-testing to failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A left total hip arthroplasty was performed in forty dogs. Thirty of the dogs had a titanium-alloy femoral prosthesis that had had one of three types of commercially pure titanium porous material applied along the length of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stem: ten with sintered fiber-metal, ten with sintered beads, and ten with plasma flame-spray coating. The remaining ten dogs had a femoral component that was circumferentially coated with commercially pure titanium that was plasma flame-sprayed along the length of the stem. In each group, five animals were killed at one month and five were killed at six months. Ingrowth of bone into all three types of porous coating was observed, indicating secure fixation of all components. By six months, there was more ingrowth of bone and new medullary bone adjacent to the proximal and distal aspects of the stems compared with the middle level of the stems in all groups. No significant difference in ingrowth of bone was observed in the beaded surface (25.2 per cent) and the fiber-metal surface (16.6 per cent) at one month, but at six months there was significantly less ingrowth into the beaded surface (23.3 per cent) than into the fiber-metal surface (37.3 per cent). In all groups, a proximal-to-distal gradient of loss of cortical bone was observed by six months. The group of dogs that had the stem with the circumferential coating experienced more severe loss of bone than did the three groups that had a stem with a partial coating. The magnitude of loss of bone was dependent on the extent rather than the type of porous coating.\r"

At follow-up, the shoulders had an average of 126 degrees of active elevation, 29 degrees of active external rotation, 81 degrees of active abduction, and internal rotation to the second lumbar vertebra. The only early complication was failure of fixation in the patient who had been treated with a buttress plate. In two patients, radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head later developed, and one of them required revision to a hemiarthroplasty. In conclusion, we recommend operative treatment for the healthy, active individual who has a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus. We found that the best results with these difficult fractures are obtained using tension-band wiring.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1971 and 1980, the senior one of us (C.S.R.) performed 101 primary total hip replacements in eighty-five consecutive patients who were less than fifty-five years old. All of the patients had degenerative joint disease. Survivorship analysis was used to calculate a predicted cumulative rate of success for this series of total hip replacements over ten years of follow-up. This method of analysis of the data was chosen because it provides a prediction of the expected durability of a total hip arthroplasty in any individual patient. The need for revision because of loosening or infection or else radiographic evidence of migration of a component was the criterion for failure. Two revisions were performed for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. One infection necessitated revision, and radiographic evidence of loss of fixation was seen in one additional acetabular component and one femoral stem. Life-table calculations predicted that the survivorship of all of the total hip replacements in this series would be 87.6 per cent at ten years of follow-up. Based on the results of the application of this method of analysis to the current series, we concluded that a primary cemented total hip replacement, when performed for coxarthrosis, can be expected to function durably in an active middle-aged patient.\r"

Although neither the urological history nor the physical examination provided information that was helpful in accurately identifying the patients who were at risk, those whose peak urinary flow rate was less than seventeen milliliters per second did have a statistically significant likelihood of the development of urinary retention. A system of management that we hope will reduce the incidence of this complication is proposed.\r"
