Pulmonary arterial branches were occluded with steel coils in 19 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, 17 with hemoptysis of pulmonary artery (PA) origin, and one with massive parenchymal shunt. Bronchial arterial supply to the lung was embolized with small particles in eight cases of hemoptysis and systemic to pulmonary arterial antegrade shunt secondary to chronic thromboembolism. Asymptomatic incidents included catheterization failures, vascular damage, partial occlusion, partial recanalization of the thrombus, ectopic deposition of a coil, and delayed bacterial contamination of the thrombus. A few cases of transient clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary infarction were observed after complete occlusion of the PA and bronchial artery embolization. This complication was never observed after complete occlusion of main right or left PA, inferior right or left PA, or segmental branches. The management and prevention of these complications, the role of bronchial arterial collateral pathways, and the importance of the site of PA occlusion in the development of pulmonary infarction are discussed.\r"

Follow-up showed that none of these patients required medical or surgical intervention as a result of extravasation. The rate of extravasation during neurologic CT scanning (head, orbits, and spine) was 0.09%, while the rate for the rest of the body (chest, abdomen, pelvis, neck) was 0.17%; the overall rate was 0.14%. The higher rate for non-neurologic studies was related to the use of a power injector. Nonionic contrast medium seemed to cause fewer systemic reactions.\r"

Neither CT findings (residual mass size, attenuation, and degree of shrinkage during chemotherapy) nor type of primary testicular tumor cell was significantly correlated with malignancy or teratoma versus necrosis in residual masses. No significant correlation was demonstrated between the combined features of (a) the absence of teratoma in a histologic specimen of the primary testicular tumor and (b) greater than 90% shrinkage of masses during chemotherapy and the absence of malignancy or teratoma in residual masses as suggested in the literature. Of nine patients with both of these findings, two had malignancy and two had teratoma. Radiographic and pathologic features cannot be used to reliably exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual abdominal masses after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous testicular cancer.\r"

Except for one, all masses were predominantly solid, and all contained some well-defined portions of low attenuation or hypoechogenicity that represented tumor necrosis. In addition, seven tumors contained uncomplicated fluid-filled cysts with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to 5 cm. Extension into the inferior vena cava was not noted. The radiologic features of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney are common to all malignant renal neoplasms. Some cases, however, may have features that simulate those of benign conditions, such as multilocular cystic nephroma or segmental cystic dysplasia. No pattern was discerned that would permit discrimination between clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and the most common renal neoplasm of childhood, Wilms tumor.\r"

Pathologic specimens were obtained at hysterectomy in all patients. Comparison of pathologic and MR imaging findings after chemotherapy showed that all tumors decreased in size. Size of tumor was correctly determined at MR in 17 cases and was slightly overestimated in four cases. Five patients had residual parametrial invasion that was histologically confirmed. In detecting parametrial spread after treatment, MR imaging had an accuracy of 90.4%. Tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas intratumoral necrosis was characterized by low signal intensity on the same images. Peritumoral inflammatory tissue found at pathologic examination in four of 21 cases was not specifically identified on MR images. In patients with invasive cervical carcinoma, MR imaging may be useful in evaluating tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy.\r"

Fourteen had calcaneal insufficiency avulsion (CIA) fractures limited to the posterior third of the calcaneus. The fracture pattern in this group occurred in the same plane as a fatigue-type calcaneal fracture. Fragments of the posterior tuberosity were usually displaced 10-30 mm and were frequently rotated. The mean time from diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to CIA fracture was 20 years. Fractures in the nondiabetic group and in the three diabetic patients with a history of trauma did not resemble the CIA pattern. In the nondiabetic group, there were no insufficiency fractures; 39 fractures occurred with significant force (eg, motor vehicle accident or fall from height), and 33 had extension to subtalar or calcaneocuboid joints.\r"

  ".W": "The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of lateral tibial rim (Segond) fractures and their associated injuries were reviewed in 12 patients with radiographic evidence of this fracture. Bone marrow adjacent to the fracture emitted a focally abnormal MR signal, which indicated an injury of the lateral capsular junction. The Segond fragment, however, was seen on MR images in only four of 12 patients. Associated ligamentous and meniscal injuries identified with MR imaging and arthroscopy involved the anterior (n = 11) and medial (n = 7) cruciate ligaments and the lateral (n = 4) and medial (n = 1) menisci. Focal bone marrow edema was due to injury of the lateral capsular junction. MR imaging evidence of such edema should indicate the presence of a lateral capsular injury and fracture, if one has not already been demonstrated with conventional radiography. A high association of Segond fractures with tears of the anterior cruciate ligament was confirmed, and MR imaging signs of a Segond fracture may therefore be used as indirect evidence for tears of that ligament.\r"

In all subjects, a focal region of relative increased signal intensity corresponding to the critical zone was observed in the supraspinatus tendon just proximal to its insertion. Soft-tissue signal intensity (isointense with muscle) was also located between the supraspinatus tendon and underlying joint capsule, interposed between the conjoined leaves of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons, and superolateral to the conjoined cuff tendon, near its insertion. These regions were most conspicuous and most clearly defined with fat-suppression imaging. Small amounts of fluid were observed within the joint space and its recesses, the bicipital tendon sheath, and the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. These and other MR imaging findings of this study previously have been regarded as indicative of rotator cuff abnormalities. These results will help refine the criteria for diagnosis of rotator cuff disorders with MR imaging.\r"

Thirty-four patients with abnormal In-111-labeled WBC patterns underwent restudy with Tc-99m albumin colloid (AC).

Ten of 12 patients with culture-proved osteomyelitis had discordant patterns; two had false-negative (concordant) patterns. The cases of 20 of 22 patients without infection who were considered to have osteomyelitis on the basis of patterns of In-111-labeled WBCs and Tc-99m MDP were reclassified correctly on the basis of concordant patterns of In-111-labeled WBCs and Tc-99m AC.

In 10 TMJs (eight patients [40%]) the clinical results were excellent or good; in 15 TMJs (12 patients [60%]), fair or poor. The position of the disk relative to its preoperative position was a good discriminator in determination of the clinical success of meniscoplasty.

However, when such benign masses press against the floor of the anterior cranial fossa and the walls of the sphenoid sinuses, simulated aggressive bone destruction rather than bone remodeling usually occurs. This type of bone destruction implies to the radiologist that a carcinoma may also be present, and this information could dissuade a surgeon from operating with an attempt at cure. In fact, about 90% of the time with inverted papillomas and in virtually all cases of nasal polyposis, no carcinoma is present. The computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance images of 14 patients are used to demonstrate these changes. In addition, the CT scans of three patients with malignancies are shown to illustrate the similarity in the bony skull base changes.\r"

On T1-weighted MR images, the masses were intermediate in signal intensity. Varying degrees of T2 shortening were shown on T2-weighted MR images, with an appearance that suggested the presence of blood products surrounding an inner matrix of higher-signal-intensity tumor. Intense enhancement at CT and MR assisted differentiation of tumor from retained sinonasal secretions. In two patients, external carotid arteriography revealed small foci of pooling contrast material; in one of these patients, arteriovenous shunting was also present.

Lesions included total occlusion (28%), dissection (42%), post-PTA restenosis (21%), and unsatisfactory PTA (9%). Complications included one aortic protrusion, one acute thrombosis of the stent (resolved with urokinase), and three distal embolizations (5.7%) (resolved with urokinase and aspiration). During 15 months of follow-up, two patients died (one after occlusion). Three other occlusions occurred; one of these was resolved with local thrombolysis. Hyperplasia occurred in seven cases (13.5%), and stenosis occurred at the end of the stent because of incomplete covering of the lesion in three (5.8%); a complementary procedure was performed in six of these cases. Primary patency was 85.3% at 12 months and 80.9% at 18 months; secondary patency rate was 96.1% at 12 and at 18 months. At the end of the study, excluding data for the two patients who died, 27 limbs (54%) were asymptomatic and improvement was achieved in 19 (38%); the clinical success rate was 92%.

Studies included a sagittal scout view followed by a non-contrast-material-enhanced, an immediate postcontrast, and a delayed postcontrast T1-weighted image (obtained at 1.0 or 1.5 T). Ten of 11 confirmed microadenomas were identified prospectively; all were identifiable in retrospect. Macroadenomas (12 cases) were well demonstrated. The high signal intensity of the posterior pituitary and of intrasellar hemorrhage was obscured on postcontrast studies. Delayed images proved unnecessary. This prospective evaluation suggests that a half-dose study is comparable to retrospective studies in which full-dose techniques were used for detection of micro- and macroadenomas. Imaging times are reasonably short, and cost of contrast material is potentially reduced. Confirmation with larger studies is required, and careful endocrinologic and clinical follow-up of nonsurgical patients is necessary.\r"

After treatment, obliteration of flow through the malformation occurs in 75%-85% of cases within 2 years, assuming the entire AVM nidus can be encompassed by the radiation field. Because the follow-up period is relatively long, a noninvasive means to assess residual transnidus blood flow is desirable. The authors report favorable findings after a comparative analysis of 85 posttreatment magnetic resonance images and 27 follow-up cerebral arteriograms in 34 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. The authors found that transnidus flow can be determined from apparent signal intensity differences between tandem two-dimensional gradient-recalled echo images obtained first without and then with gradient moment nulling (flow compensation), with empirically derived pulse parameters. This method provides a means to monitor the reduction in AVM matrix size and to assess the extent of persistent arteriovenous shunting (ie, blood flow) across the nidus.\r"

T2-weighted MR images showed atrophied cerebral white matter with dilated ventricles; increased signal intensity of the white matter; and decreased signal intensity of the thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebral cortex. Although each single finding is not specific, the combination of the above MR findings when coupled with skeletal lesions strongly suggests this rare disease.\r"

One hundred three fetal US examinations were performed to determine the prevalence and appearance of this finding. Also, US water-bath examination of 18 fixed postmortem specimens and fetuses was performed, and results were correlated with those of gross and microscopic examination of the fetal brain. The structure was identified in 95 (92%) prenatal examinations between 15 and 38 menstrual weeks. It was located posteriorly between the cerebellar hemispheres in the cisterna magna. In those 95 cases in which it was identified, it appeared as a single echogenic line in 31 cases (33%), as two echogenic lines in 47 (49%), or as three or more lines in 17 (18%). When two echogenic lines were identified, they appeared \"cystlike\" in 17 (18%) of the 95 examinations. Correlation of the gross and histologic findings demonstrated these lines to represent normal subarachnoid septa rather than the straight sinus.\r"

The prognosis for fetuses with cephaloceles was poor: Only three of 14 with follow-up were born alive (21%), and all are likely to be handicapped. Karyotypes were abnormal in four of nine fetuses tested (44%). Associated cranial abnormalities observed in various numbers of fetuses included ventriculomegaly, the \"lemon\" sign, a flat basioccipital, \"beaked\" tectum, and bone defect. A wide variety of neural and nonneural anomalies were associated with cephaloceles. At least one sonographically observed concomitant neural or nonneural axis abnormality or an abnormal karyotype was present in nine of 15 fetuses (60%). Some associated neural malformations noted pathologically were not observed prenatally. Cranial meningoceles were not accurately distinguished from encephaloceles sonographically, and they also were associated with a poor prognosis. Comparison of findings in fetuses with cephaloceles with those of 15 fetuses with cystic hygromas revealed that the two abnormalities can usually be distinguished by the relationship of the mass with the neck and by other cranial findings present in fetuses with cephaloceles but absent in association with cystic hygromas.\r"

To determine whether hypointense marrow sometimes represents normal red marrow in a recently ossified epiphyseal center, the authors studied 38 infants without known marrow disease. Patients with hypointense epiphyseal marrow on T1-weighted images were younger (3.9 months +/- 3.2) than those with hyperintense marrow (9.6 months +/- 3.9) (P less than .001). T1-weighted imaging and histologic correlation were also performed in animals. The signal was hypointense and the marrow was red in the epiphyseal centers of all newborn animals, while all 6-week-old animals had hyperintense signal and yellow marrow. The authors conclude that hypointense marrow on T1-weighted images represents normal red marrow in a recently formed ossification center in newborn rabbits and lambs, and the same is probably true in humans. Epiphyseal marrow becomes hyperintense within a few months of development of the secondary center of ossification.\r"

Rarely, extralobar sequestration can be associated with tension hydrothorax, which in the past has invariably led to fetal hydrops and death. The authors report the cases of three infants who had initially undergone color and spectral Doppler analysis; in two of them, extralobar sequestrations were associated with congenital hydrothorax. All three patients underwent surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation of their sequestrations. On the basis of the findings, the authors believe that torsion of the sequestration occludes the efferent venous and lymphatic channels, initiating the accumulation of pleural fluid and subsequent hydrops through systemic venous obstruction. Color Doppler made possible the identification of minute feeding vessels, obviating further diagnostic studies.\r"

The articles were organized into 16 categories. By quantifying the number of times these socioeconomic and political issues appeared and comparing quotations from the articles, the authors demonstrated many common issues in the two periods, despite drastic differences in radiology practice. Analysis of historical literature provides perspective on current socioeconomic and political issues and may help formulate solutions to current problems. Documentation of such issues facilitates historical analysis and is an important function of the radiology literature.\r"

In 405 women (39.9%), at least two-thirds of the breast tissue was radiodense; however, in 299 (29.4%) women the breast was predominantly fatty, allowing for excellent mammograms. Six women had carcinomas: Mammographic findings prompted biopsy in one patient, indicated a benign-appearing mass (found to be solid at sonography or aspiration) in three patients with a palpable mass (contributing to delay in biopsy in two), and were negative in two. Sonography was performed in 389 women and was useful in preventing unnecessary biopsy of cysts but was not useful in differentiating benign from malignant solid masses. Younger women with persistent localized breast symptoms should undergo a tailored mammographic examination, but negative findings or findings of a benign lesion should not preclude biopsy of a palpable solid mass.\r"

Although in most cases the major fissure was seen as a line on thin-section CT scans, this appearance was more common in the upper portion of the left major fissure than in the upper portion of the right major fissure. A \"double-fissure sign\" was most frequently seen at the base of the left lung; however, the sign was also seen at higher levels, with approximately equal frequency in the right and left lungs. An incomplete major fissure was noted in the right lung in 32 cases (64%) and in the left lung in 26 cases (52%). The upper and middle portions of the left major fissure were less frequently incomplete than were the comparable portions of the right major fissure. Thin-section CT provided better delineation of the major interlobar fissures than did standard CT.\r"

The effects on MR imaging of the lung are loss of signal from intravoxel phase dispersion (measured with T2') and a shift in the macroscopic resonant frequency from that of water toward that of air (delta v). These effects of MR imaging at 1.5 T were quantitated by measuring T2' decay and delta v at different locations in the lungs of two adult volunteers and one excised inflated human lung. The average T2' was 7 msec in the excised inflated specimen and 6.3 msec in normal in vivo lungs. There was a gravitational increase in T2' from nondependent to dependent lung. T2' increased to 35 msec in atelectatic lung tissue and to more than 140 msec in tumor. The macroscopic resonant lung frequency increased to 3.6 ppm more than that of mediastinal muscle. These values are important for developing MR pulse sequences appropriate for imaging lung parenchyma.\r"

Subject contrast was measured with a photostimulable phosphor detector, and images were acquired in both equalized and nonequalized (conventional) imaging modes. Available subject contrast in the lung-equivalent region was 8%-15% lower in the equalized images compared with the nonequalized images in all phantoms (patient types); contrast in the mediastinum-, retro-cardiac-, and subdiaphragm-equivalent regions was 11%-63% higher in the equalized images, with the degree of improvement increasing as patient size and dynamic range increased. Images of each phantom were also acquired with the screen-film systems currently in use at the authors' institution, permitting an assessment of the relative performance (in terms of radiographic contrast) of these imagers with and without use of equalization.\r"

The effects of fluoroscopic kilovoltage and image intensifier magnification mode were also measured. The results indicate that the highest scattered radiation levels occur near the surface of the patient where the x-ray beam enters. Exposure rates were measured in both anteroposterior (AP) and posteroanterior (PA) geometries on a U-arm system. In PA geometry, the highest radiation levels occur below the angiographer's waist, an area well protected by the lead apron. The AP geometry increases the exposure rate to the neck, head, and upper extremities, areas where apron shielding is less effective.\r"

  ".U": "91335209\r", 
  ".W": "The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a single immunoglobulin binding domain (B1, which comprises 56 residues including the NH2-terminal Met) of protein G from group G Streptococcus has been determined in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the basis of 1058 experimental restraints. The average atomic root-mean-square distribution about the mean coordinate positions is 0.27 angstrom (A) for the backbone atoms, 0.65 A for all atoms, and 0.39 A for atoms excluding disordered surface side chains. The structure has no disulfide bridges and is composed of a four-stranded beta sheet, on top of which lies a long helix. The central two strands (beta 1 and beta 4), comprising the NH2- and COOH-termini, are parallel, and the outer two strands (beta 2 and beta 3) are connected by the helix in a +3x crossover. This novel topology (-1, +3x, -1), coupled with an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and a tightly packed and buried hydrophobic core, is probably responsible for the extreme thermal stability of this small domain (reversible melting at 87 degrees C).\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are important for the development of colorectal cancers, particularly those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). To facilitate the identification of genes from this locus, a portion of the region that is tightly linked to FAP was cloned. Six contiguous stretches of sequence (contigs) containing approximately 5.5 Mb of DNA were isolated. Subclones from these contigs were used to identify and position six genes, all of which were expressed in normal colonic mucosa. Two of these genes (APC and MCC) are likely to contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis. The MCC gene had previously been identified by virtue of its mutation in human colorectal tumors. The APC gene was identified in a contig initiated from the MCC gene and was found to encode an unusually large protein. These two closely spaced genes encode proteins predicted to contain coiled-coil regions. Both genes were also expressed in a wide variety of tissues. Further studies of MCC and APC and their potential interaction should prove useful for understanding colorectal neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are responsible for the inheritance of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome (GS), and contribute to tumor development in patients with noninherited forms of colorectal cancer. Two genes on 5q21 that are tightly linked to FAP (MCC and APC) were found to be somatically altered in tumors from sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of the genes (APC) was also found to be altered by point mutation in the germ line of FAP and GS patients. These data suggest that more than one gene on chromosome 5q21 may contribute to colorectal neoplasia, and that mutations of the APC gene can cause both FAP and GS. The identification of these genes should aid in understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and in the diagnosis and counseling of patients with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer.\r"

The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3.\r"

There was a mean lag time of five years between clinical presentation and immigration. Logit analysis showed that, although overall more men had tuberculosis than women, glandular tuberculosis was more common among women of all groups, and pulmonary tuberculosis was more common among Hindu women than Hindu men. Both subgroups of Asians had a substantially higher incidence of tuberculosis than white people, particularly at extrapulmonary sites. Hindus were also at a significantly greater risk of tuberculosis at all sites than Muslims (Hindu:Muslim risk ratio 5.5 for women and 3.7 for men). The increased susceptibility to tuberculosis of Hindus, particularly Hindu women, may be related to a culturally acquired immunodeficiency caused by vegetarianism and associated vitamin deficiency.\r"

Cough, fever, and sputum production were the usual reasons for presentation and four patients developed the sepsis syndrome. Radiographic findings included de novo cavitation in three patients and rapid radiographic progression in four. Aspergillus species were isolated from respiratory secretions of all patients early in the course of the disease. Treatment was effective in only two patients and the subsequent progress of the others was consistent with a chronic necrotising process. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is uncommon in patients with respiratory diseases receiving corticosteroids, but should be considered when pneumonia and cavitary infiltrates occur.\r"

Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for five days after surgery. Eight patients received bupivacaine and eight placebo (saline). The mean pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours were 13.3, 8.5, 6.1, and 10 mm respectively in the bupivacaine group compared with 56.3, 41, 46.7, and 35 in the control group; in addition, the bupivacaine group required less papaveretum. Twenty four hours after surgery mean values of peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity were reduced to 82%, 76%, and 76% of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 39%, 32%, and 36% in the control group. The speed of recovery of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group. There were no complications related to the infusion. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve blockade with bupivacaine provides safe and effective postoperative analgesia and improves respiratory mechanics after pleurectomy.\r"

The 310 men with circumscribed pleural lesions (plaques) or diffuse pleural thickening without asbestosis were compared with 596 men with asbestosis only and with 322 men with pleural abnormalities and asbestosis, as classified from chest radiographs by ILO pneumoconiosis criteria. Spirometric indices and total lung capacity (TLC; determined by planimetry) were measured and expressed as percentages of predicted values. Non-smoking men with pleural disease only had reduced values of mid and terminal expiratory flows (80.6 and 69.9% predicted) and a reduced FEV1 (89% predicted) with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 94% predicted. TLC was 104% predicted. Thus they had airways obstruction with-out restriction. Non-smoking men with pulmonary asbestosis (ILO profusion of opacities mostly 1/0 and 1/1) had pulmonary function similar to that of men with pleural disease. FEV1 and FVC and flow rates at other lung volumes were lower in smokers with asbestosis (after adjustment for duration of smoking) than in the non-smokers with asbestosis. Airflow limitation was worse in the men with both pleural abnormalities and pulmonary asbestosis with lower values for mid expiratory flow, FEV1 and FVC (but not TLC) than those with either abnormality alone, in both non-smokers and current smokers. Men with diffuse pleural thickening that included the costophrenic angles had more airways obstruction and air trapping and lower FVC values than those with circumscribed pleural disease.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 1-3 hours (group 2, n = 9) and 16-20 hours (group 3, n = 10) after the last dose of N-acetylcysteine and the values were compared with those in a control group receiving no N-acetylcysteine (group 1, n = 8). N-acetylcysteine was not detected in plasma or lavage fluid. Plasma concentrations of cysteine, the main metabolite of N-acetylcysteine and a precursor of reduced glutathione, were greater in the groups receiving treatment (groups 2 and 3) than in group 1. Cysteine concentrations in lavage fluid were similar in the three groups. Concentrations of reduced glutathione were greater in both plasma and lavage fluid in group 2 than in group 1. These data suggest that N-acetylcysteine given by mouth is rapidly deacetylated to cysteine, with resulting increases in the concentrations of cysteine in plasma and of reduced glutathione in plasma and the airways, which thus temporarily increase the antioxidant capacity of the lung.\r"

  ".W": "Beta 2 agonists reduce airway hypersensitivity to bronchoconstrictor stimuli acutely in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. To determine whether these drugs also protect against excessive airway narrowing, the effect of inhaled salbutamol on the position and shape of the dose-response curves for histamine or methacholine was investigated in 12 patients with asthma and 11 with chronic obstructive lung disease. After pretreatment with salbutamol (200 or 400 micrograms) or placebo in a double blind manner dose-response curves for inhaled histamine and methacholine were obtained by a standard method on six days in random order. Airway sensitivity was defined as the concentration of histamine or methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). A maximal response plateau on the log dose-response curve was considered to be present if two or more data points for FEV1 fell within a 5% response range. In the absence of a plateau, the test was continued until a predetermined level of severe bronchoconstriction was reached. Salbutamol caused an acute increase in FEV1 (mean increase 11.5% predicted in asthma, 7.2% in chronic obstructive lung disease), and increase in PC20 (mean 15 fold in asthma, fivefold in chronic obstructive lung disease), and an increase in the slope of the dose-response curves in both groups. In subjects in whom a plateau of FEV1 response could be measured salbutamol did not change the level of the plateau. In subjects without a plateau salbutamol did not lead to the development of a plateau, despite achieving a median FEV1 of 44% predicted in asthma and 39% in chronic obstructive lung disease. These results show that, although beta 2 agonists acutely reduce the airway response to a given strength of bronchoconstrictor stimulus, they do not protect against excessive airflow obstruction if there is exposure to relatively strong stimuli. This, together with the steepening of the dose-response curve, could be a disadvantage of beta 2 agonists in the treatment of moderate and severe asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

These peptides were compared among the different specificities, and those that were unique were identified. For example, there were 375 unique tripeptides when considering both the A and B locus. The 1-year kidney graft survival was determined for patients who were mismatched for each of the tripeptides. The peptides were ranked according to the associated graft survival, and the sum of the ranks was used as a mismatching score. The rank sum score produced promising results, for some degree of correlation was noted when tested against another set of patients transplanted without CyA, and a third set of those who received grafts from related donors. We conclude that matching for tripeptides of the HLA-A and -B locus is associated with graft outcome, and that this may be a more effective way of HLA matching for transplants, particularly since a higher fraction of patients fall into the high-survival category.\r"

Those infections that do occur in the transplant patient are strongly modulated by the type, intensity, duration, and sequence of immunosuppressive agents administered. A central role in the pathogenesis of all forms of infection in the transplant patient is played by the immunomodulating viruses, particularly cytomegalovirus. Prevention of infection is far better than treatment; when prevention fails and clinical disease develops, patient and allograft survival are directly related to the speed with which diagnosis is made and specific therapy instituted. In order to prevent disease, both antimicrobial prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are being increasingly employed, particularly to blunt the side effects of intensive antirejection therapy.\r"

Improvement in treatment results requires innovative effective therapies to enhance the direct antineoplastic effects of the preparative regimen or immune-mediated antileukemia mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow transplantation has proven its value as a therapeutic approach to a variety of human diseases, primarily the hematopoietic malignancies. The major clinical problems preventing successful outcome of marrow transplant have been defined and therapeutic approaches to preventing or treating these complications have led to increased long-term disease survival. Passively administered antibody given as intravenous immunoglobulin has been studied as a therapeutic modality following bone marrow transplantation. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of immunoglobulin in reducing bacterial infections in the posttransplant period; reducing severe CMV infections in allogeneic marrow transplant recipients who are seronegative for the virus and susceptible to primary infection; reducing mortality from CMV pneumonia in combination with ganciclovir; and reducing acute graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic BMT. In many cases alternate therapeutic strategies offer comparable or greater efficacy (eg, selective CMV-negative blood products for CMV seronegative allogeneic BMT recipients receiving bone marrow from a seronegative donor). However, it is clear that intravenous immunoglobulin has a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of bone marrow transplantation. Future controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish its exact role and to define which preparations and dose schedules provide the greatest therapeutic benefits.\r"

There was no difference in 1-year graft or patient survival in the two induction regimens. Despite a slight delay in time to first rejection, the number, severity, and outcome of rejections were the same in both. Fifty percent of patients never had a rejection, and 80% of these were on CyA monotherapy at 1 year vs only 22% in patients with rejections. Thirty-five percent had a rejection in the first month, and one fourth of these had a repeat in the second month. The risk of graft loss was 10% with a first, 38% with a second, and 50% with a third rejection. First rejections occurring after 30 days rarely caused graft loss and rejection after 90 days proved to be unusual.\r"

Follow-up was carried out for surgically treated BPH from the date of the MHC to the date of the earliest of the following: surgery for BPH (n = 1,027); incidence of prostate cancer (n = 329), bladder cancer (n = 119), or both (n = 10); other prostate surgery (n = 5); death (n = 2,525); membership termination (n = 4,235); or December 31, 1987 (n = 7,969). The mean length of follow-up was twelve years. In multivariate analysis utilizing the Cox proportional hazards model, the following characteristics were positively associated (p less than 0.05) with risk of surgically treated BPH: age, low body mass index, nonsmoking (vs. current smoking), urine pH greater than 5, history of kidney x-ray and of tuberculosis, and each of five urologic symptoms (dysuria, loss of bladder control, trouble starting urination, nocturia, slow urine stream). The risk of BPH associated with obstructive urologic symptoms decreased markedly with age. Some of these findings are consistent with those from other studies (age, nonsmoking), while others (high urine pH, history of tuberculosis) are new and should be examined in other study populations.\r"

Questions which best discriminated between the groups were those dealing with urinary symptom frequency, bother due to urinary symptoms, and worry and concern about urinary problems. The results suggest that urinary-symptom-bother and worry due to urinary symptoms may be important additions to the more usual questions asked about urinary frequency in the identification of men with BPH. These findings are preliminary, however, and will be verified in an ongoing natural history study of BPH.\r"

The incidence of initial prostatectomy for BPH among men forty-five years of age and older age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. white male population was 642 cases per 100,000 persons per year (py). Among the 330 men undergoing initial prostatectomy for BPH, 14 (4.2%) had serious intraoperative complications, 32 (9.7%) were rehospitalized for urologic complications within thirty days of surgery, and 13 (3.9%) had other serious complications within thirty days after surgery, including 1 death (surgical mortality 0.3%). Forty-five patients (14%) required blood transfusions within thirty days of surgery. The likelihood of reoperation within six years of the initial surgery was 15.1 percent (95% CI 9.7, 20.6). Short- and long-term postoperative mortality was not statistically significantly different than expected based on age- and sex-specific mortality statistics for Rochester, Minnesota.\r"

The age-specific prevalence of clinically diagnosed BPH agreed closely at all ages with the age-specific autopsy prevalence of pathologically defined BPH from a published international compilation of 5 independent autopsy studies involving 1,075 prostates.\r"

The data are derived from a retrospective, population-based study conducted in Hagen, Germany, which included all patients with an initial prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (N = 621) during the five-year period 1984-1988. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had at least one of the following preoperative risk factors: heart disease, hypertension, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diabetes. There was no intraoperative death. The risk of intraoperative circulatory complications was found to be related to age only for patients without a history of heart diseases or hypertension. The incidence of major complications was 3.1 percent and was significantly higher in the oldest age group. Three patients (0.54%) died postoperatively in the hospital. Infections were the most frequent postoperative complications. The relationship of age and overall postoperative complications was not statistically significant either for patients with (p = 0.121) or without any comorbidity (p = 0.651). Based on this study it seems reasonable to conclude that age is not a clinically relevant risk factor for perioperative complications in patients who have a transurethral resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia.\r"

Among this cohort of men, urinary symptoms were found to be strongly predictive of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and this risk varied by age. Nocturia (OR 1.8) and hesitancy (OR 4.3) were found to be predictive of surgery for younger men (age range 49-55), while only nocturia (OR 2.4) was predictive among older men (age range 62-68). This age-related difference in both identification of risk factors and magnitude of association with surgery was independent of assessing other commonly studied risk factors. Ultimately, the decision to operate is a combination of patient's need, access to care, and patient's preference. Further research will be required to assess which factor or factors are responsible for the age-related differences in surgical risk factors.\r"

Although angiography is the imaging gold standard for the diagnosis of these disorders, Doppler sonography, scintigraphy, and occasionally CT are capable of detecting them. An awareness of the different imaging appearances of each complication will aid in their early detection and treatment. In this review, we present this information and provide a perspective on the relative roles of these techniques in the detection of vascular complications from renal transplants.\r"

We investigated the radiographic abnormalities that occurred in 39 transplantation patients with a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and correlated the findings with the patients' clinical course. The initial radiographic abnormalities after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed an average of 11 days after bone marrow transplantation, and the radiographic abnormalities preceded the clinical diagnosis by an average of 3 days. Twenty-seven patients initially had bilateral radiographic abnormalities; 10 initially had unilateral abnormalities (seven in the right lung, three in the left lung). Two patients had normal chest radiographs throughout their clinical course. All 37 patients with radiographic abnormalities had abnormalities involving the central portion of the lung, primarily the middle and lower lung zones. The initial radiographic pattern was interstitial in 27 and alveolar in 10. In 24 patients, radiographic abnormalities were initially judged to be mild; three were severe from the onset. Radiographic abnormalities rapidly worsened in most patients over 6 days. In 30 patients, diffuse bilateral radiographic abnormalities involving all lung zones developed. Eleven patients persisted in having only interstitial radiographic abnormalities; 26 had a confluent alveolar pattern. At the height of radiographic abnormalities, 27 cases were judged to be severe, and only one case was judged to be mild. The mortality rate in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was 77%. The radiographic abnormalities of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are nonspecific and usually precede the clinical diagnosis. The clinical course after hemorrhage is short, often resulting in death.\r"

We identified identical artifacts in 18% of 50 consecutive contrast-enhanced CT examinations performed for a variety of indications on the same scanner. The double-lumen artifact, simulating an intimal flap, occurs in the proximal ascending aorta and is limited to one or two contiguous transaxial images. The artifact was not detected on two other CT units. We believe the artifact arises from motion of the aortic wall and the surrounding pericardial recesses during image acquisition.\r"

We surveyed 485 patients during a 3-month period to study how self-referred mammography patients differ from physician-referred patients. Self-referred patients were more likely than physician-referred patients to have a family income of more than $30,000 per year, to be college graduates, and to consider their health as good or excellent. A large percentage of self-referred patients performed other health-promoting practices, but were not significantly more likely to do these than were physician-referred patients. Women who referred themselves were more likely to have a friend with breast cancer and to believe that cancer could be cured. They expressed much less worry about radiation exposure and were more likely to consider $50.00 an appropriate charge for a screening mammogram. By far, the greatest motivator for self-referred patients was health promotion and disease prevention. Self-referred mammography patients tend to be wealthier, more education, and less concerned about the cost and radiation dose of mammography when compared with physician-referred mammography patients.\r"

We assessed changes in gallbladder contractility in response to an oral fatty meal in 50 patients 1 month after biliary ESWL (all fragments were smaller than 3 mm) and also in a separate group of 10 patients 3 months after complete clearance of fragments. The prevalence of persistent lumen-obliterating contraction of the gallbladder after biliary ESWL also was analyzed in 325 patients. Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged in 30, increased in nine, and decreased in 11 of the 50 patients. The average reduction in the fasting gallbladder volume after lithotripsy was 28% (p less than .001). Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged 3 months after complete clearance of fragments in six of 10 patients studied separately. A decrease (n = 2) or increase (n = 2) in contractility was seen in the remaining patients. No significant difference occurred in the average ejection fraction of the gallbladder before lithotripsy and after complete clearance of the fragments. Thirty-four of the 325 patients who have so far undergone biliary ESWL had a completely contracted gallbladder with no lumen visible on sonography. The gallbladder returned to a relaxed state in half of these patients within 1-9 months. Thus, biliary ESWL did not significantly alter gallbladder contractility in 60% of patients. A significant reduction in the volume of the fasting gallbladder occurred after lithotripsy. Successful clearance of fragments did not improve the contractility of stonebearing gallbladders in the majority of patients.\r"

We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Transurethral balloon dilatation of the prostate has been shown to be a safe and potentially effective alternative to surgery in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, with a 66% success rate in relatively unselected patients. This study hypothesized that more careful patient selection might result in a significantly better rate of improvement. Ninety-one subjects with symptoms and signs of prostatism attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia were studied. Group 1 comprised 42 patients with an initial mean symptom score of 16.8, residual urine of 249 ml, maximal flow rate of 7.9 ml/sec, and nomogram of maximal flow rate of -1.5. Group 2 comprised 49 less symptomatic patients with an initial mean symptom score of 14.5, residual urine of 105 ml, maximal flow rate of 10.7 ml/sec, and nomogram of maximal flow rate of -0.8. The difference in mean age and prostate size between groups was not statistically significant, but differences in baseline symptom score, residual urine, maximal flow rate, and nomogram of maximal flow rate were significant (p less than .04). Transurethral balloon dilatation of the prostate was performed under local anesthesia or IV sedation and analgesia with single-or double-balloon catheters with maximal diameters of 25-30 mm inflated to 2.5-4.0 atmospheres pressure for 10 min. Patients were followed up with repeat symptom scoring, uroflometry, and measurement of residual urine. After a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 6-48 months), an improvement in symptom score was seen in 80% of group 2 patients compared with 43% in group 1. Improvement in symptom scores was statistically significant in both groups (p less than .04). We conclude that transurethral balloon dilatation of the prostate is more effective in patients with more moderate symptoms and with less marked signs of obstruction than in patients with more marked prostatism.\r"

  ".W": "The noninvasive diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetic patients with currently available radiologic and radionuclide imaging techniques is often difficult. Recently, 111In-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy has been proposed as an attractive alternative. Accordingly, we retrospectively reviewed 51 111In-labeled leukocyte scans, 49 technetium-99m bone scans, and 49 plain radiographs obtained in 51 adults with diabetes in whom osteomyelitis of the foot was suspected. The sensitivity and specificity of these techniques were evaluated in all patients, as well as in a subgroup of 11 patients with neuroarthropathy. Results with 111In-labeled leukocyte scans were also examined in subsets of patients with soft-tissue ulcers (n = 35) and those receiving antibiotics during investigation (n = 20). Confirmation or exclusion of osteomyelitis was made surgically in 28 patients and clinically in 23. Fourteen patients had osteomyelitis. Bone scans were most sensitive (93%) but least specific (43%); plain radiographs were most specific (83%) but least sensitive (43%). 111In-labeled leukocyte scans were both sensitive (79%) and specific (78%), and remained useful in patients with neuroarthropathy, soft-tissue ulcers, and antibiotic treatment. Poor spatial resolution contributed to the false-negative and false-positive 111In-labeled leukocyte scans, suggesting that this technique should not be interpreted independent of other tests. 111In-labeled leukocyte scans are a valuable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of pedal osteomyelitis in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "A direct comparison was made between digital and conventional radiographs to assess the relative accuracy of a photostimulable phosphor digital imaging system in detecting and localizing minor trauma in the extremities. Matched sets of images were obtained on 103 patients who came to the emergency department for radiographs of the hand, wrist, foot, or ankle. One set was obtained with a conventional screen/film system. The other set was obtained with photostimulable phosphor digital cassettes. The two sets of images of each patient were independently interpreted by three radiologists in a blinded fashion. The findings of each of these three readers were compared with the consensus opinion of two different radiologists. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for each of the three readers, areas under the curves were calculated, and true-positive fractions were determined at false-positive fractions of 0.1. Although no significant differences in the areas under the ROC curves for the two imaging systems were detected, conventional radiography showed a slight advantage. However, when true-positive fractions for fracture detection were compared at false-positive fractions of 0.1 a statistically significant difference was shown, with conventional screen/film radiography being more sensitive. This study raises questions about the use of currently available photostimulable phosphor systems for imaging trauma of the extremities and suggests that those systems should not be used exclusively.\r"

On the basis of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients. Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections.\r"

The greatest length of each of 498 kidneys in 397 consecutive fetuses between 18 and 41 weeks gestation was measured on sonograms. Gestational ages were determined by last menstrual period and biometry; significant discrepancies led to case exclusion. Abnormal fetuses, twins, offspring of diabetic mothers, and fetuses with renal pelvic dilatation of 4 mm or greater were excluded to avoid any questionable measurements. The results show that mean lengths are greater and confidence intervals are wider than previously reported. Renal lengths are similar to those reported in premature and full-term neonates. Strong correlation exists between renal length and gestational age, determined by biparietal diameter, femoral length, and abdominal circumference, and an average of the three. No significant difference was found between right and left renal lengths in fetuses in whom both kidneys were imaged. Average renal lengths are significantly different when compared across the range of gestational ages (p less than .001). No correlation is seen (r = .00) between parental height or weight and fetal renal length. Our results show that fetal renal lengths are longer than previously reported.\r"

These cystic masses were discovered either prenatally by using sonography or early in the neonatal period as palpable flank masses. Imaging studies, including sonography and CT, could not confidently exclude malignancy. After the masses were removed surgically, histologic examination showed them all to be benign hemorrhagic macrocysts within the capsule or permanent cortex (in contrast to neonatal adrenal hemorrhage, which usually occurs more centrally in the fetal cortex). The cysts were as large as 8 cm in diameter, and in one case a solitary cyst was predominant. Hemihypertrophy was present in all cases. Four of the six lesions were right-sided, and there was a male-female ratio of 5:1. Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts are a cause of abdominal mass in the fetus and neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.\r"

In seven patients, sonography revealed many small hypoechoic areas suggestive of lymphoid infiltration. In three older children, large anechoic areas suggesting lymphoepithelial cysts were present. The lesions probably represent generalized lymphoid infiltration akin to pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, although only two of our patients had radiologic evidence of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia. Four of five of the children with parotid enlargement who had immunologic studies were phenotypically HLA-DR5, an immunophenotype associated with improved immune response, occurring in less than one in four in the normal population. This suggests that painless parotid enlargement may be a good prognostic sign in HIV-seropositive children. Parotid enlargement was found in 10 HIV-positive children from 6 months to 11 years old. All except one were infected prenatally.\r"

  ".W": "Personnel from the 72 facilities with the most experience in MR imaging were surveyed, and 45 questionnaires were returned with data to study the economics and use of MR imaging facilities. The data from 1990 were compared with results of studies done in 1985 and 1987. The facilities studied were highly selected, and the data and conclusions are unlikely to be representative of all MR facilities currently operational in the United States. The \"typical\" MR unit operated about 66 hr per week and imaged 68 patients. Most procedures were examinations of the head and spine (73%), with examinations of bone and joint increasing in frequency (17%). Scheduling delays for both inpatients and outpatients have decreased since 1987, indicating that clinical demand is being met by MR facilities. The global (technical plus professional) charge for an examination was approximately $950, and the charge for IV contrast material was an additional $200. IV contrast material was used in approximately 40% of head and 20% of spine studies. The typical MR units in 1990 was used to examine more than 3000 patients per year at a charge of approximately $750 each for the technical component. Technical billings for each unit were approximately $2.3 million, and net revenues were almost $1.9 million. We estimate the annual operating cost of an MR unit in 1990 was $1.3 million, so the typical MR unit had an annual net profit of approximately $500,000. This is a considerable improvement from the economic position in 1985, when each MR unit was losing approximately $400,000 annually. We conclude that experienced MR imaging facilities are now profitable owing to increased efficiency and continually rising charges. We suggest the economic historical pattern demonstrated by MR imaging (large losses initially followed by profitability within several years owing to increased efficiency and higher charges) is a typical pattern for many new technologies with the current medical payment system in the United States.\r"

This information can, for example, indicate the opportunities available to a radiology practice considering opening a new office or show whether high-technology radiology is, as is widely assumed, an important factor in United States health costs. However, neither the total number of procedures nor their cost is known. We developed two largely independent estimates of each total (one based principally on surveys of radiologists, the other on Medicare data) to cross-validate the estimates and provide an indication of their uncertainty. We estimate that 260-330 million radiologic procedures were performed in the United States in 1990 (including both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and radiologic procedures performed by nonradiologists) and that payments for these services totaled $19 to $22 billion (including payments for technical components in the hospital setting). This total was approximately 3.5% of national spending on personal health care; high-technology radiology totaled less than half of this amount. The procedures numbered 1.0-1.3 per capita annually, an increase of some 10-40% since 1980. Of the spending total, $10 to $12 billion was paid to physician practices, with a substantial portion of this amount going ultimately to practice expenses, particularly in the office setting. Our results suggest that spending on high-technology radiology is too small to be a major explanation for the current level of health costs in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without a history of systemic hypertension was investigated in 2,466 patients using the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial data-base. The baseline variables were comparable in the diltiazem and placebo-treated patients within the groups with and without hypertension. The initial 60-mg dose of diltiazem was associated with a significant (p less than 0.001) but modest (3%) reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in both groups with and without hypertension. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a meaningful overall reduction in first recurrent cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction, whichever occurred first) and cardiac death in patients with hypertension treated with diltiazem compared with results in those treated with placebo. Similar effects were not observed in patients without a history of hypertension. When first recurrent cardiac events were used as the end point, the diltiazem:placebo hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) was 0.77 (0.58, 1.01) for the total hypertension group, and 0.67 (0.47, 0.96) and 1.32 (0.83, 2.10) for patients with hypertension with and without pulmonary congestion during the acute infarction, respectively. Similar results were observed using cardiac death as the end point. Beta blockers had a negligible effect on the hypertension-diltiazem relation. These findings suggest that diltiazem may exert a long-term beneficial effect in most patients with hypertension who do not have pulmonary congestion during an acute infarction, and a detrimental effect in the minority who have pulmonary congestion.\r"

For all cause mortality, where, for a sensitivity of 75%, HR variability index had a specificity of 52%, EF had a specificity of 40%. It is concluded that HR variability index appears a better predictor of important postinfarction arrhythmic complications than left ventricular EF, but both indexes perform equally well in predicting all-cause mortality.\r"

Of the 75 consecutive patients who initially presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V6, I, aVL) and were treated with intravenous streptokinase (time from symptoms to treatment averaged less than 3 hours), 32 (43%) developed a non-Q-wave and 43 (57%) a Q-wave myocardial infarction. Twenty seven of 32 patients (84%) from the non-Q-wave group and 39 of 43 (91%) from the Q-wave group were studied by angiography at 5.16 +/- 2.88 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 13 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 +/- 8 vs 49 +/- 14% (p less than 0.001) and the infarct vessel patency rate was 85 vs 72% (p = 0.44) in patients with a non-Q versus a Q-wave infarction, respectively. In summary, when patients presenting with chest pain and ST-segment elevation are treated with streptokinase, a significant portion of these symptoms will evolve into a non-Q-wave infarction. Patients with a non-Q-wave infarction will have a better preserved left ventricular function than patients who develop a Q-wave infarction. This suggests the need for equal distribution of such patients in randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction to avoid misinterpreting data between groups.\r"

After baseline angiography, patients were randomized to 3 different treatment groups: group I--urokinase (1,000,000 U intravenous bolus dose), followed by heparin infusion 3 hours later; group II--heparin (10,000 U intravenous bolus, followed by continuous infusion); and group III--conventional therapy only (intravenous nitroglycerin, beta blockers and calcium antagonists). Angiography was repeated at 1 hour and at 8 days of treatment and minimal cross-sectional area was determined in the 35 patients who completed the study. In group I, minimal cross-sectional area increased from 0.84 +/- 0.48 mm2 at baseline to 0.94 +/- 0.49 mm2 at 1 hour (p less than 0.05), and to 1.00 +/- 0.51 mm2 at 8 days (p less than 0.01 vs baseline). In group II, a significant increase in minimal cross-sectional area was observed only at the 8-day angiography (0.64 +/- 0.39 mm2 at baseline; 0.67 +/- 0.37 mm2 at 1 hour [p = not significant]; and 0.79 +/- 0.48 mm2 at 8 days [p less than 0.01] vs baseline). In group III, no significant changes in minimal cross-sectional area occurred either at 1 hour or at 8 days. Thus, both urokinase and heparin improved lesion geometry in patients with unstable angina, although a large individual variation was noticed. The effect occurred earlier with urokinase than with heparin.\r"

In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge. Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients. One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis. Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel). There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period. Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment.\r"

Classes of dissection were then correlated with clinical outcome: 543 patients with type B dissections had no increase in morbidity and mortality when compared with patients without dissection, with a similar success rate of 93.7%. Complications in this group were low and compared favorably with complication rates in procedures not associated with dissection. One hundred forty-eight procedures associated with dissections of types C to F had a significant increase in in-hospital complications, including acute closure (31%), need for emergency coronary bypass surgery (37%), myocardial infarction (13%) and repeat angioplasty (24%). The overall clinical success rate for those with types C to F dissection was 38%. The differences in clinical success and acute complications between type B and types C to F dissections were statistically significant at p less than 0.0005 for all variables studied. The angiographic morphology of a dissection during coronary angioplasty can predict clinical outcome, aiding in selection of effective therapy.\r"

Thirty-eight patients (8%) had LM stenosis (diameter narrowing greater than or equal to 50%). The LM scintigraphic pattern was present in 9 of 38 patients with LMCAD and 38 of 428 CAD patients without LMCAD (24 vs 9%; p less than 0.005). This pattern was present in 6 of 9 patients with LMCAD without right CAD and in only 3 of 29 patients with LM and right CAD (67 vs 10%; p = 0.0005). Patients with LMCAD had a higher incidence of premature cessation of low-level exercise (53 vs 21%; p less than 0.0001), chest pain (68 vs 48%; p less than 0.02), blood pressure decrease of greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg (44 vs 16%; p less than 0.002) and greater ST depression (0.17 +/- 0.13 vs 0.06 +/- 0.10 mV; p less than 0.001) during dipyridamole loading than patients without LMCAD. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that the LM scintigraphic pattern and markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LMCAD without right CAD (sensitivity 67%, specificity 91%), but this predictability is no better than the LM scintigraphic pattern alone. The combination of clinical markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading and scintigraphic findings of diffuse slow washout, extensive fixed defects and the LM pattern best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LM and right CAD (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-four patients taking no cardioactive therapy were studied using intravenous dipyridamole (0.6 mg/kg) during 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Twelve patients had normal coronary arteries (group 1) and the remainder, who had significant CAD, were divided into groups 2 (n = 11) and 3 (n = 11). Only subjects in group 2 developed myocardial ischemia manifest as reversible regional asynergy and ST-segment depression. Heart rate increased (16 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure decreased (-5 +/- 8 mm Hg, p = not significant) uniformly across groups. Exaggerated hyperkinesia of normally contracting wall segments was the common response to dipyridamole infusion in patients with CAD. The respective mean percent changes in peak early diastolic velocity, peak atrial velocity, their ratio and ejection peak velocity, and mean acceleration for groups 1 (20, 42, -13, 20 and 23%), 2 (22, 32, -2, 10 and 14%) and 3 (23, 33, -6, 16 and 18%) were similar. Comparisons between normal patients and those with CAD and between groups 2 and 3 revealed no significant differences in the effect of dipyridamole on any variable. However, a decrease in both peak velocity and mean acceleration of left ventricular ejection was seen in 3 of 4 group 2 patients who developed severe ischemia. Dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography is insensitive for detection of CAD and appears unable to identify myocardial ischemia unless this is severe. Hemodynamic changes and compensatory wall motion induced by dipyridamole may explain these findings.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler-derived parameters of aortic flow were examined during heavy isometric exercise in 48 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 48 gender- and age-matched healthy controls. The aim was to determine which parameters best separated the groups and to look for a possible relation between exercise-induced Doppler patterns and the extent of CAD. Isometric exercise was performed with a 2-hand bar dynamometer, and the subjects were required to perform 50% of maximal voluntary contraction for 2 minutes. Examination was performed with a pulsed Doppler transducer positioned at the suprasternal notch. Resting peak flow velocity, acceleration time, stroke volume index and cardiac index did not show significant differences between the groups. However, mean acceleration and stroke work were significantly lower in patients with CAD. In this group, exercise peak flow velocity decreased from 98 +/- 13 to 55 +/- 12 cm/s, flow velocity integral from 14 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 3 cm, mean acceleration from 11 +/- 0.9 to 4.7 +/- 1 m/s/s, and stroke volume index from 41 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 4 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001 for all). Cardiac index decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.4 to 2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). Acceleration time increased from 82 +/- 6 to 116 +/- 7 ms. In most of the indexes, the directional changes induced by isometric exercise were similar in patients with CAD and in normal control subjects. The differences compared with the rest values were significantly greater in the CAD group, and especially in patients presenting with 3-vessel disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and experimental data show that type I atrial flutter is due to a reentry mechanism with an excitable gap. To define the location of the reentry circuit of atrial flutter, width of excitable gap, poststimulation cycle and pattern of reset after premature stimulus were analyzed in 18 patients during atrial flutter at multiple atrial sites (high, lateral, posterior and septal right atrium, and coronary sinus). The pattern of reset was defined as flat or increasing whether the return cycle remained unchanged or prolonged with increasing prematurity. Shorter values of the excitable gap were found at the coronary sinus (33 +/- 8 ms) and high right atrium (30 +/- 10 ms) than at the posterior (43 +/- 9 ms) or septal right atrium (45 +/- 11 ms). Intermediate values (36 +/- 8 ms) were measured at the lateral right atrium. Poststimulation cycle, corrected for atrial flutter cycle length, was shorter in the posterior (6 +/- 7 ms) and septal right atrium (5 +/- 7 ms) than in the coronary sinus (35 +/- 9 ms), and the high (23 +/- 10 ms) and lateral right atrium (15 +/- 9 ms). A flat pattern of resetting occurred more frequently at the septal (18 of 18 patients) and posterior right atrium (15 of 18) than at the lateral (8 of 18) and high right atrium (2 of 17), and was never observed at the coronary sinus. Atrial flutter was successfully terminated by overdrive atrial pacing in 15 of 18 patients, and termination was more easily obtained from the septal and posterior right atrium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treadmill and bicycle exercise were used to modulate cardiac autonomic activity in 27 Romano-Ward subjects and 27 normal controls. The heart rate, and the QT, QTc and QT/QS2 (ratio of electrical to mechanical systole) intervals were compared. Subjects with long QT were compared with normals. Those with a long QT interval had the following results: similar resting heart rates; lower rates during moderate (151.6 vs 169.6 beats/min, p = 0.04) and maximal (155.9 vs 182.1 beats/min, p = less than 0.001) exercise; an abnormal QT cycle-length relationship, with failure of the QT to shorten normally with increasing heart rate; an increase in QTc versus a decrease in normals; supine rest QT/QS2 ratio of 1.12 vs 0.93, p = 0.001; and an exercise QT/QS2 that increased by 30%, from 1.12 at rest to 1.45, versus 15%, in normals, from 0.93 to 1.07, p = 0.001. The lower heart rates and excessively prolonged QT/QS2 ratios during exercise further support an abnormality of, or abnormal cardiac response to, sympathetic activity. A QT/QS2 greater than 1.0 at rest, an exercise QT/QS2 ratio greater than 1.17, and an increase in QTc during moderate exercise may be helpful diagnostic findings in patients with borderline long QTc intervals at rest.\r"

  ".W": "Reduced septal uptake of thallium-201 during exercise is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteries. This may reflect normal coronary autoregulation in response to lower septal oxygen demand; thus, dipyridamole, which uniformly exploits flow reserve, would be more accurate for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixteen patients with LBBB underwent exercise and dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within 3 months. Sensitivity for detection of left anterior descending CAD (greater than 50% stenosis) was 0.83 for exercise and 1.00 for dipyridamole. Specificity was 0.30 (visual) or 0.20 (quantitative analysis) for exercise and 0.80 (visual) or 0.90 (quantitative) for dipyridamole (p less than 0.05). Dipyridamole combined with quantitative analysis also improved specificity of CAD detection overall (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that pharmacologic vasodilation is more accurate than exercise when diagnosing CAD by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with LBBB.\r"

Celiprolol produced an immediate dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (49 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.005) that was associated with an increased heart rate (67 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (2,347 +/- 129 to 2,708 +/- 111 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01). Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure with short-term treatment (p less than 0.01); this was associated with a reduced total peripheral resistance with celiprolol (from 24 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.02) and was not observed with atenolol. Moreover, in contrast with atenolol, celiprolol did not change heart rate or stroke and cardiac indexes. Splanchnic and forearm vascular resistances decreased with celiprolol (p less than 0.05) but not with atenolol; neither beta-blocking drug altered renal blood flow. These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were strikingly different from atenolol; celiprolol reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral and certain vascular resistances without altering heart rate, cardiac index or regional blood flows. These effects may be explained by celiprolol's cardiac beta-1 receptor inhibitory and peripheral beta-2 receptor agonistic effects.\r"

The effect of the Valsalva maneuver on the transmitral flow velocity profile was therefore studied in 28 patients without evidence of coronary artery disease (group 1, mean age +/- standard deviation 50 +/- 8 years) and in 94 patients with evidence of coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension (group 2, mean age 54 +/- 10 years). At baseline, group 2 patients had higher peak late diastolic filling velocity (A), lower peak early (E) to late diastolic filling velocity (E/A) ratio and longer isovolumic relaxation time than group 1, whereas heart rate, E velocity and E deceleration time were similar in both groups. During Valsalva, both groups had similar increases in heart rate and similar decreases in E velocity but E/A ratio decreased significantly only in group 2 because of a lesser decrease in A velocity. The E/A ratio was greater than or equal to 1.0 both before and during Valsalva in all but 1 patient in group 1, whereas in group 2, 32 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest and during Valsalva, 33 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest but less than 1.0 both at rest and during Valsalva. Using group 1 as controls, prevalence, specificity and positive predictive value of E/A less than 1.0 in group 2 were 31, 100 and 100% at rest and 66, 96 and 98% during Valsalva.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For cases with a deletion mutation, the \"reading frame\" hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the \"reading frame\" theory in 92% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many \"in-frame\" deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al., at the 5' end of the gene.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of a genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was investigated in data from a large multicenter, population-based, case-control study, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for mothers and sisters of 493 ovarian cancer cases, 895 breast cancer cases, and 143 endometrial cancer cases versus 4,754 controls were calculated. Significantly elevated age-adjusted RRs were found for ovarian cancer (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-4.9) and breast cancer (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) among relatives of ovarian cancer probands and for breast cancer (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.7-2.5) and ovarian cancer (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) among relatives of breast cancer probands. Relatives of endometrial cancer probands had an elevated RR for endometrial cancer only (RR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8). The genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was tested using a multivariate polygenic threshold model developed by Smith (1976), which was modified to accommodate three classes of probands. Estimates of heritability for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer were 40%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. There was a significant genetic correlation between ovarian and breast cancer (R12 = .484). Evidence for significant genetic overlap between endometrial cancer and either ovarian or breast cancer was not found. These results suggest the existence of a familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Endometrial cancer, while heritable, appears to be genetically unrelated.\r"

  ".W": "The study of contiguous gene deletion syndromes by using reverse genetic techniques provides a powerful tool for precisely defining the map location of the genes involved. We have made use of individuals with overlapping deletions producing choroideremia as part of a complex phenotype, to define the boundaries on the X chromosome for this gene, as well as for X-linked mixed deafness with perilymphatic gusher (DFN3). Two patients with deletions and choroideremia are affected by an X-linked mixed conductive/sensorineural deafness; one patient, XL-62, was confirmed at surgery to have DFN3, while the other patient, XL-45, is suspected clinically to have the same disorder. A third choroideremia deletion patient, MBU, has normal hearing. Patient XL-62 has a cytogenetically detectable deletion that was measured to be 7.7% of the X chromosome by dual laser flow cytometry; the other patient, XL-45, has a cytogenetically undetectable deletion that measures only 3.3% of the X chromosome. We have produced a physical map of the X-chromosome region containing choroideremia and DFN3 by using routine Southern blotting, chromosome walking and jumping techniques, and long-range restriction mapping to generate and link anonymous DNA sequences in this region. DXS232 and DXS233 are located within 450 kb of each other on the same SfiI and MluI fragments and share partial SalI fragments of 750 and greater than 1,000 kb but are separated by at least one SalI site. In addition, DXS232, which lies outside the MBU deletion, detects the proximal breakpoint of this deletion. We have isolated two new anonymous DNA sequences by chromosome jumping from DXS233; one of these detects a new SfiI fragment distal to DXS233 in the direction of the choroideremia gene, while the other jump clone is proximal to DXS233 and detects a new polymorphism. These data refine the map around the loci for choroideremia and for mixed deafness with stapes fixation and will provide points from which to isolate candidate gene sequences for these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "A method is described to reveal the relative predispositional effects (RPEs) (predisposing, protective, or neutral) of the HLA alleles or of any other marker system that is associated with a disease. When the disease is associated with two or more alleles of a locus, the RPE method identifies the associations sequentially according to their strength; thus the problem that a strong association with one allele can create misleading deviations in the frequencies of other alleles is alleviated. Using this method, we have examined the relative effects of HLA-DR alleles in susceptibility to Graves disease in the Caucasian population. The well-established positive association with DR3 was confirmed as the strongest effect. In addition, a negative association was found between DR5 and Graves disease. The reduced frequency of DR5 among patients is statistically significant and is not a result of the increase in DR3. Finally, when patients were divided according to the presence or absence of eye disease, the latter showed a significant increase in the frequency of DR4. With family data, linkage to HLA of Graves disease was established in both Caucasian and Chinese families by the sib-pair method.\r"

However, only a fraction of the DNA sequence polymorphisms in the human genome affect the length of a restriction fragment and hence result in an RFLP. Polymorphisms that are not detected as RFLPs are typically passed over in the screening process though they represent a potentially important source of informative genetic markers. We have used a rapid method for the detection of naturally occurring DNA sequence variations that is based on enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. This approach can detect essentially all useful sequence variations within the region screened. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by applying it to the human retinoblastoma susceptibility locus. We screened 3,712 bp of genomic DNA from each of nine individuals and found four DNA sequence polymorphisms. At least one of these DNA sequence polymorphisms was informative in each of three families with hereditary retinoblastoma that were not informative with any of the known RFLPs at this locus. We believe that direct sequencing is a reasonable alternative to other methods of screening for DNA sequence polymorphisms and that it represents a step forward for obtaining informative markers at well-characterized loci that have been minimally informative in the past.\r"

In the present study, regressive models recently developed by Bonney were used to compare specific models of inheritance and to test for etiologic heterogeneity among three subgroups of 375 flow-lesion families identified by the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study. When all families were analyzed as a single group, the best-fitting model was a simple recessive model with Mendelian transmission; race did not have a significant effect on estimated risk. Separate analyses of families of probands with left heart defects, right heart defects, and ventricular septal defects (VSD) confirmed this simple Mendelian recessive model as the model of choice. However, when race was included as a covariate in these genetic models, there was evidence for significant heterogeneity among the three subgroups. There was an increased risk to relatives of white probands with right heart defects and to relatives of black probands with VSD, while there was no effect of race among relatives of probands with left heart defects. These results strongly suggest that there is etiologic heterogeneity in the control of CCVM among flow-lesion families and that the patterns of familial aggregation differ among the races.\r"

In the present study, we have carried out extensive RFLP analysis of various nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids with at least 50 different chromosome 11-specific probes to determine the precise location of this tumor-suppressor gene(s). Two different hybrid systems, (1) microcell hybrids derived by the transfer of a normal chromosome 11 into a tumorigenic HeLa-derived hybrid cell and (2) somatic cell hybrids derived by the fusion of the HeLa (D98OR) cells to a retinoblastoma (Y79) cell line, were particularly informative. The analysis showed that all but one of the nontumorigenic hybrid cell lines contained a complete copy of the normal chromosome 11. This variant hybrid contained a segment of the long arm but had lost the entire short arm of the chromosome. The tumorigenic microcell and somatic cell hybrids had retained the short arm of the chromosome but had lost at least the q13-23 region of the chromosome. Thus, these results showed a perfect correlation between the presence of the long arm of chromosome 11 and the suppression of the tumorigenic phenotype. We conclude therefore that the gene(s) involved in the suppression of the HeLa cell tumors is localized to the long arm (q arm) of chromosome 11.\r"

In several diseases, only a limited number of pedigrees are linked to a particular region, because of linkage heterogeneity. Disequilibrium in this situation is more easily detected when the association is positive (an infrequent marker allele associated with disease mutation), and sampling is conditional on presence or absence of illness in individuals or gametes. Defining H as the marker frequency in illness-transmitting gametes, and Q the marker frequency in normal chromosomes, we compute the power of a given sample (of ill persons/gametes) to detect association in a disease that is genetically heterogeneous, with a dominantly transmitted form linked to a marker. The estimation of Q and the effects of linkage heterogeneity (when unrelated individuals are examined) are also analyzed. Two linked pedigrees give acceptable power to detect association when the allele is frequent enough in illness gametes (H greater than or equal to .6) and infrequent enough in normals (Q less than or equal to .01). If H greater than or equal to .2, 14 pedigrees are needed to give the same power. From the analysis of different values of Q and H, it appears that even in the presence of considerable genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance (where some normals carry the disease mutation), association may be detected with clinically feasible sample sizes.\r"

By isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting, three common alleles have been demonstrated in 365 unrelated Nigerian blacks. Furthermore, the APO E genetic polymorphism's effect on quantitative levels of lipids and lipoproteins has been determined. The respective frequencies of the APO E*2, APO E*3, and APO E*4 alleles are .027, .677, and .296. The effect of APO E polymorphism is significant only on total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The average excesses of the APO E*2 allele are to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 9.19 mg/dl and 11.11 mg/dl, respectively. The average excesses of the APO E*4 allele are to increase total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 5.64 mg/dl and 6.18 mg/dl, respectively. On the basis of the differences in (a) the distribution of APO E allele frequencies between the Nigerians and other populations and (b) dietary lipids, we propose a model that shows that lipid metabolism is influenced by the combined effects of the APO E polymorphism and environmental factors.\r"

The Y chromosome cannot complement the defect; thus, unlike at least two other noninactivated X loci, A1S9T has no functional Y-linked homologue.

  ".W": "A series of Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids were constructed which were heterozygous at the emtB and chr loci. These loci encode two recessive drug-resistance genes (emetine resistance and chromate resistance, respectively) located on a structurally hemizygous region on the long arm of chromosome 2. These heterozygous hybrids therefore exhibit wild-type sensitivity to both emetine and chromate. Drug-resistant variants were then selected in medium containing either emetine or chromate, and the mechanism of reexpression of the recessive drug-resistant allele was determined by karyotypic analysis of the resultant colonies. In previous studies at these loci we have determined that segregation of the recessive phenotype occurs primarily by (1) the loss of the chromosome 2 carrying the wild-type, drug-sensitive, allele, (2) deletion of the long arm of chromosome 2, or (3) loss of one chromosome 2 followed by duplication of the remaining homologue. However, a small proportion of segregants have also been detected which may have arisen by the mechanisms of de novo gene inactivation or mutation. In this report, hybrids are described which were constructed to allow selection for the retention of the chromosome carrying the wild-type allele and which therefore optimize isolation of these rare segregants. We demonstrate by karyotypic analysis, mutation frequency analysis, and microcell-mediated chromosome transfer that these rare segregants occur primarily by gene inactivation. We also demonstrate a dramatic increase in the proportion of segregants occurring by gene inactivation in two of these hybrids as compared with those previously reported, indicating that this mechanism may be an important mode of phenotype segregation in diploid cells and, therefore, in the development of cancers--such as the childhood tumors retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor--resulting from recessive alleles\r"

A second survey of 931 members of genetic support groups found that, although they obtained genetic information from a variety of professional and informal sources, many of them experienced barriers to obtaining sufficient genetic information. Respondents called for professionals to improve their interpersonal skills in working with clients and to assist families in obtaining a wider variety of services. On the basis of these findings, a service model and priorities are proposed to bring together genetic specialists, community professionals, and genetic support groups for the delivery of comprehensive services to individuals and families with genetic disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding of the long-term action of sulfonylureas in humans with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) may be facilitated by studying the effect of long-term sulfonylurea administration to animal models of the disease. In this study two different versions of the neonatal streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZ) rat model of NIDDM were used. The n5-STZ model (STZ on day 5 after birth), which is characterized by basal hyperglycemia, a marked reduction of pancreatic insulin stores, and insulin resistance, and the n0-STZ model (STZ on day of birth), which develops mild hyperglycemia, have an approximately 50% reduction in pancreatic insulin content, and no insulin resistance. The diabetic rats were given oral gliclazide (10 mg/kg/day) and compared with untreated diabetic rats and nondiabetic rats. Insulin secretion was studied the day after the last gliclazide dose using the isolated perfused pancreas preparation. In severely hyperglycemic n5-STZ rats (plasma glucose levels greater than 16 mmol/L) the long-term gliclazide treatment did not lower the plasma glucose values, did not affect pancreatic insulin stores, and did not significantly modify in vitro insulin release in response to glucose or arginine. In moderately hyperglycemic n5-STZ rats (plasma glucose levels less than 16 mmol/L) the plasma glucose levels declined progressively and reached a mean of 8 mmol/L at the end of gliclazide therapy. The increase in pancreatic insulin stores in n5-STZ rats remained marginal. In the n0-STZ rats gliclazide treatment did not significantly modify the plasma glucose levels or the pancreatic insulin stores. After gliclazide therapy in both the n5-STZ gliclazide responder group and the n0-STZ group: (a) in vitro glucose-induced insulin secretion was increased three- to fivefold; (b) the response to arginine, which is increased in diabetic rats, was amplified by two- to threefold; (c) insulin release in response to gliclazide was unchanged. In conclusion, long-term gliclazide therapy augments stimulated insulin secretion in these two rat models of NIDDM and does not induce any refractoriness to short-term sulfonylurea administration. The improvement of beta-cell function observed here was not related to the concomitant variations of hyperglycemia and/or pancreatic insulin content.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin regulation of hepatic glucose production (HGP) is altered in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), resulting in increased glucose output by the liver; this contributes to the elevation in plasma glucose concentration observed both in the basal state and postprandially. Therefore, restoration of normal insulin action in the liver must be a goal of hypoglycemic therapy. Sulfonylureas have been widely used for treatment of NIDDM over the past 30 years. In addition to their stimulatory effect on insulin secretion, these compounds seem to possess extrapancreatic effects. Early in vitro studies showed that addition of sulfonylureas to the perfusion medium of liver preparations could exert a significant suppressive effect on HGP. Subsequent experience suggested that these compounds could act at the level of the insulin receptor as well as at various postreceptor sites. These studies showed that sulfonylureas may inhibit glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis while stimulating glycogen synthesis. Results obtained in vivo in NIDDM patients are in agreement with the in vitro studies. Long-term treatment with sulfonylureas is associated with a decline in fasting plasma glucose concentration and a parallel reduction in HGP. Nevertheless, the direct effect of sulfonylurea administration on the liver remains unclear, since the reduction in HGP that occurs during sulfonylurea treatment may be secondary to an overall improvement in insulin secretion. It is also of interest that in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, sulfonylurea administration in combination with insulin injections is not followed by a significant change in HGP. Possible effects of sulfonylureas on glucagon secretion and on the metabolism of free fatty acids (FFAs) may also contribute to improved sensitivity of the liver to the suppressive action of insulin, since these agents appear to reduce plasma glucagon and FFA concentrations. Thus, present data support an extrapancreatic action of sulfonylureas on the liver. However, it does appear that a certain degree of residual insulin secretion is required for sulfonylurea agents to elicit their hepatic effect.\r"

Decreased insulin secretion and diminished tissue insulin sensitivity are both implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease; both may be exacerbated by persistent hyperglycemia and improved by normalization of blood sugar levels. Measures to control hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are important in the management of NIDDM and prevention of its long-term complications. The effects of dietary modification, exercise, and antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, as well as of pharmacologic control of blood sugar, on the vascular and renal complications of NIDDM have been investigated. Gliclazide is a second-generation sulfonylurea drug whose efficacy in the treatment of NIDDM, alone or in combination with insulin, has been widely demonstrated. Studies of the use of gliclazide, reported at recent symposia, are summarized in this review.\r"

  ".U": "91336284\r", 
  ".W": "In 10 obese, new-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients (group A), continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was used to induce normoglycemia during 14 days. Fasting blood glucose was 4.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L and mean daily blood glucose 5.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/L at the end of the CSII period. This excellent glycemic control was obtained with 35 +/- 4.8 U of insulin per day, corresponding to 0.47 +/- 0.06 U/kg/24 hours. Endogenous insulin production was markedly suppressed, since urinary C-peptide was reduced from 18.5 +/- 0.12 to 7.9 +/- 0.25 nmol/24 hours. Gliclazide was given to group A following CSII, and to five obese NIDDM patients (group B) in their habitual hyperglycemic state. Gliclazide maintained in group A, and induced in group B, excellent metabolic control. This was accompanied by the appearance of a small first-phase insulin response to intravenous glucose, and significant increases in the mean-daily-insulin to mean-daily-blood-glucose ratio, as well as in the 24-hour urinary C-peptide-to-glucose ratio. The gliclazide effects tended to be more pronounced in group A. No significant effect was seen on efficacy of endogenous insulin (slope of disappearance of blood glucose divided by insulin levels). During 6 months of gliclazide treatment, excellent glycemic control was maintained in all patients. This was paralleled by unchanged stimulation by gliclazide of first-phase insulin response to glucose, and augmented mean 48-hour insulin-to-glucose and urinary C-peptide-to-glucose ratios. No change in the ratio of glucose disposal to endogenous insulin was noted. We conclude that physiologic insulin replacement may induce normoglycemia in NIDDM, indicating that insulin resistance is not of clinical significance; gliclazide has a beta-cell-stimulating action that is maintained quantitatively unchanged for at least 6 months; the therapeutic effect of gliclazide in NIDDM seems to be mainly, if not exclusively, the result of its beta-cytotrophic action. Initial normoglycemia, induced here by CSII, may have a lasting enhancing effect on the gliclazide action.\r"

An overall reduction in fasting and postprandial blood sugar was observed (p less than 0.001). Total glycated hemoglobin (HbA1) fell significantly (p less than 0.001), to revert to values within the reference range in over 80% of cases. Body weight remained stable over a period of observation ranging from 36 to 60 months. The incidence of subsequent failure of oral treatment was 2% per annum. These results show that long-term treatment of type II diabetes with gliclazide leads to satisfactory results, with practically no side effects.\r"

The prevalence of these complications is increased about two- to four-fold in people with diabetes in the United States, and they contribute substantially to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The pathogenesis of macrovascular disease in diabetes is multifactorial. Endothelial injury is an early event, followed by macrophage adherence and uptake of lipids to produce a fatty streak. Platelet adherence, aggregation, and release of thromboxane and platelet-derived growth factors may then occur. Quantitative and qualitative alterations of lipoproteins are seen, particularly in uncontrolled insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Hyperinsulinemia may be contributory, as may elevated plasma proinsulin levels. Glycation of plasma proteins and of components of the vascular wall occurs, and altered coagulation and/or fibrinolysis may lead to thrombosis. The process is accelerated by hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia. Gliclazide is an oral sulfonylurea agent that has been reported to have actions on platelet function and fibrinolysis in addition to its effects on glycemia. The evidence for this is reviewed, and recommendations for future studies are made.\r"

Gliclazide, an agent whose preventive effect has previously been suggested in other experimental models of atheroma, was also investigated in these diabetic and hypercholesterolemic animals. Sand rats were fed a natural diet (ND group), a standard laboratory feed (StD group), or a high-cholesterol feed (HCD group) for 15 months. Biologic parameters were monitored throughout the period of the study, and histologic and histochemical examinations were conducted when the animals were killed (month 15). One StD group and one HCD group were treated with gliclazide from month 3 to month 15. The StD group developed a syndrome of obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and triglyceridemia. The high cholesterol feed further increased hypercholesterolemia. These biologic abnormalities were accompanied by arterial lesions (thickening of the intima, deposition of glycosaminoglycans). Foam cells were seen in the intima, and microthrombi were present in the lumen of the arteries of animals in the HCD group. Long-term gliclazide medication at doses that normalized serum glucose levels also reduced the obesity, hyperinsulinemia, lipid disorders, and it prevented or retarded the appearance of arterial lesions.\r"

This article reviews the factors believed to be involved in pathogenesis and attempts to draw these together by suggesting a sequence of pathogenic interactions that could result in the microvascular changes seen in susceptible target organs. Possibilities for therapeutic intervention based on these pathogenic mechanisms are discussed. A small pilot trial of an oral hypoglycemic agent, gliclazide, is reported, providing evidence for a specific action of this drug on thromboxane synthesis and platelet aggregation. This is independent of glycemic control and may in part be mediated by a fall in lipid peroxides.\r"

Standard treatment has aimed at correcting only disturbed glucose metabolism, but this may lead only to the partial amelioration of certain hemobiologic factors. In addition to its metabolic action, gliclazide has been shown to have specific hemobiologic properties; studies with gliclazide in animals and humans have shown significant improvements of platelet abnormalities, stimulation of prostaglandin I2 synthesis, and enhancement of fibrinolytic activity. In humans, open-label studies have shown that gliclazide treatment leads to stabilization of background retinopathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetics and, more recently, these beneficial effects have been confirmed in controlled studies lasting up to 37 months in which other sulfonylureas were used. The Japanese Diabetic Retinopathy Program studied the progression of retinopathy over a 5-year period, comparing gliclazide with other sulfonylureas and with placebo. This study showed that, with equivalent metabolic control, there was a trend toward a lower rate of deterioration and a significantly lower incidence of preproliferative retinopathy in the group receiving gliclazide compared with those receiving other sulfonylureas. Overall, the specific hemobiologic actions of gliclazide appear to offset or retard the progression of diabetic retinopathy and may have the advantage of lowering the incidence of preproliferative retinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 20-30% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) started on sulfonylureas fail to respond to treatment (primary failure); in the remaining patients, secondary failure to sulfonylurea therapy occurs at a rate of 5-10% per year. On the other hand, in insulin-treated NIDDM patients a progressive increase in insulin requirement can occur without significant improvement in glucose control. In these patients the combination of oral agents with insulin therapy may be useful. The rationale behind this therapeutic approach resides in the synergistic action of the two agents on specific mechanisms responsible for glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia. Long-acting insulin, administered as a single dose at supper or bedtime, should restrain excessive overnight hepatic glucose production, thus allowing a significant reduction in fasting glucose concentrations. A lower ambient glucose level should favor the stimulatory effect of sulfonylureas on insulin secretion. Sulfonylurea treatment should increase the portal inflow of secreted insulin with a resultant increase in insulin levels draining into liver, thus reducing postprandial hepatic glucose output. Moreover, sulfonylureas might improve insulin action on its target tissue (i.e., muscle), thus increasing overall insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. The reduction in prevailing plasma glucose levels will reduce the toxic effect of hyperglycemia on the beta-cell and on insulin-sensitive tissues. On this basis, NIDDM patients with secondary failure of monotherapy may benefit from combined therapy. Nevertheless, the effects of combined therapy should be strictly monitored and intensive insulin therapy promptly started if poor control persists.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by fasting hyperglycemia associated with defects in the pancreatic islet, the liver, and the peripheral tissues, which together comprise a feedback loop responsible for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. This review focuses on the key role of the endocrine pancreas alpha and beta cells to coordinate glucose output from the liver with glucose utilization. The basal rate of hepatic glucose utilization. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production is elevated in subjects with NIDDM, and this is positively correlated with the degree of fasting hyperglycemia. This increased rate of glucose release by the liver results from impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin, reduced insulin secretion, and increased glucagon secretion. Though basal immunoreactive insulin levels in patients with NIDDM may appear normal when compared with healthy individuals, islet function testing at matched glucose levels reveals impairments of basal, steady-state, and stimulated insulin secretion due to a reduction in beta-cell secretory capacity and a reduced ability of glucose to suppress glucagon. The degree of impaired beta-cell responsiveness to glucose is closely related to the degree of fasting hyperglycemia but in a curvilinear fashion. The efficiency of glucose uptake by the peripheral tissues is also impaired due to a combination of decreased insulin secretion and defective cellular insulin action. This impairment becomes more important to the hyperglycemia as the islet alpha- and beta-cell function declines. Therapeutic interventions, to be effective, must reduce hepatic glucose production either by improving islet dysfunction and raising plasma insulin levels, or improving the effectiveness of insulin on the liver. Both result in a decline in the fasting glucose levels regardless of the cause of hyperglycemia. We conclude that NIDDM is characterized by a steady-state re-regulation of plasma glucose concentration at an elevated level in which islet dysfunction plays a necessary role. Treatment should be based on this physiologic understanding.\r"

We defined sensitivity as a greater than or equal to 70% decrease in intracellular adenosine triphosphate versus control at 20% of the reported peak plasma concentration per agent tested. Twenty of 21 assays (95.24%) were completed successfully. Single-agent and combined dose-response patterns consisting of decreasing viability with increasing drug concentration were observed consistently. Thirteen primary tumors were assayed, with 15.4% sensitive to cisplatin, 7.7% sensitive to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and 53.8% sensitive to their combination. Seven recurrent tumors were assayed, with 14.3% sensitive to cisplatin, 28.6% sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, and 42.9% sensitive to their combination. Dose-response characteristics and in vitro sensitivity rates reported in this article are consistent with reports of patient response in the literature. We conclude that adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay is an efficient and reliable instrument for the in vitro chemosensitivity assessment of human tumors and warrants further clinical investigation.\r"

Antepartum cervical evaluation has been suggested as a way to better define the risk of preterm delivery in multifetal gestations. Weekly digital cervical examinations were performed in 86 twin and 7 triplet gestations that were being monitored in a special antepartum clinic. A cervical score was calculated from each examination by subtracting cervical dilatation in centimeters from cervical length in centimeters. Cervical scores decline gradually with advancing gestation and are influenced by parity and subsequent preterm delivery. Intervals until delivery decrease significantly with lower cervical scores. A cervical score less than or equal to 0 on or before 34 weeks' gestation was strongly predictive of preterm delivery (75%). Only 2 of 78 (2.6%) with a score greater than 0 were delivered within 1 week of the examination. Cervical scoring is a simple, quantifiable, reproducible, and safe method of evaluating preterm delivery risk. An understanding of the prognostic significance of specific cervical scores may be of value in determining the need for obstetric intervention.\r"

When these two complaints are evaluated individually, both pain during daily activities (p less than 0.05) and dyspareunia (p less than 0.05) are more likely to improve after lysis of adhesions in women without chronic pain syndrome. Prognosis was not related to the number of previous operations, adhesion score, or other physical parameters. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions is generally worthwhile in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, although the presence of psychosocial compromise warrants preoperative evaluation and concomitant treatment.\r"

One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers.\r"

Stages I, II, III, and IV included 25, 39, 15, and 12 patients, respectively. Corrected 5-year survival rates were 73% for stage I, 39% for stage II, 38% for stage III, and 25% for stage IV. Sixteen percent of patients had received prior pelvic radiation. Invasive cervical cancer preceded vaginal cancer in 21% of patients. Detection of cancer was accomplished by routine cytologic testing in 17% of patients, palpation of an asymptomatic mass in 10% of patients, or palpation of a symptomatic mass in 72% of patients. Eighty-seven percent of patients were treated with radiation therapy. Survival curves of patients grouped by stage and other potential prognostic factors were compared. Lower stage (p less than 0.01), younger age (p less than 0.02), and no symptoms at detection (p less than 0.01) were statistically significant favorable prognostic factors. Histologic type, extent of vaginal involvement, vaginal location, prior radiation therapy, prior cervical cancer, and prior hysterectomy are factors that did not significantly affect survival.\r"

Baseline values were obtained in 155 women from less than 1 year up to 30 years after menopause. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol tended to rise during the early postmenopausal years while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. Triglycerides were related to weight and were significantly different only between untreated women of normal weight (128.3 +/- 7.80 mg/dl) and hormone users weighing greater than 200 pounds (252.9 +/- 9.44 mg/dl), p less than or equal to 0.001. Although mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower with both C-21 progestogens (64.5 +/- 4.16 mg/dl) and C-19 progestogens (61.9 +/- 3.84 mg/dl), there were no statistically significant differences on comparison with levels in the unopposed estrogen users (67.0 +/- 3.94 mg/dl). Smoking significantly depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both hormone users (p less than or equal to 0.001) and untreated women (p less than or equal to 0.001). Added progestogens do not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins over the long term when adequate dosages of estrogens are used.\r"

However, epidemiologic studies of invasive carcinoma of the vulva have produced conflicting evidence for these associations, in part because of a strong association with vulvar inflammatory disease (dystrophies) in older women. We analyzed a series of 42 vulvar invasive carcinomas for papillomavirus nucleic acids by deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid in situ hybridization and correlated their presence with age, smoking history, and morphologic type. The carcinomas were divided into well-differentiated, moderately and poorly differentiated, and intraepithelial-like growth patterns, the latter composed of nests of invasive neoplastic epithelium with preserved cell polarity, similar to intraepithelial disease. Of the lesions studied, 28% were human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive. Intraepithelial-like neoplasms segregated in women with a younger mean age (64 versus 73 years) than that of women with conventional squamous cell carcinoma and they more frequently had a history of cigarette smoking (88% versus 28%). Moreover, intraepithelial-like lesions contained human papillomavirus nucleic acids more frequently (67% versus 13%) when analyzed by in situ hybridization. These observations confirm the diverse nature of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and may explain in part why conflicting results are obtained from studies investigating the role of sexual and viral factors in the genesis of vulvar cancer. They suggest that many invasive vulvar cancers may not be linked to papillomaviruses.\r"

The male sexual partners of 180 of these women were examined and, if indicated, treated (treatment group). The 180 remaining male sexual partners were neither examined nor treated (control group). One hundred twenty-two (68%) men in the treatment group had human papillomavirus-associated lesions. The treatment failure rate of women was 16.7% in the treatment group and 18.9% in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05).

A limiting factor may be inability of otherwise viable embryos to be released from the intact zonae pellucidae. Culture conditions and/or cryopreservation in in vitro fertilization may affect the zona and impair blastocyst hatching. Therefore opening of the zona by partial slicing by means of micromanipulation before replacement of early cleaved embryos may improve chances of eventual hatching (referred to as assisted hatching). In 65 thawed embryo replacement cycles methyl-prednisolone and antibiotics were given for 4 days mid cycle. Assisted hatching was performed in 32 cycles, with 33 cycles left as controls. Patient's age, infertility, cycle supplementation, and number of thawed and replaced embryos did not differ significantly between the two groups. Rates of viable embryonic implantation were 16% (10/63) and 9% (6/64) in the assisted hatching and control groups, respectively. Group sizes need approximately to double before this trend toward improved implantation with the use of assisted hatching reaches statistical significance.\r"

The accompanying hyperinsulinemia results in acanthosis nigricans, an epiphenomenon of this syndrome. The knowledge that states of insulin resistance of diverse causes are associated with ovarian hyperandrogenism makes the argument for insulin-driven ovarian androgen secretion compelling. However, equally compelling evidence suggests that hyperandrogenism may contribute to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The irreconcilable differences between these two hypotheses have resulted in an array of contradictory studies. In this article a unified concept of polycystic ovary syndrome and its androgen-insulin connection is proposed. The hypothesis incorporates the role of hyperinsulinemia in the androgen excess observed (and vice versa); the key to this connection is the androgen-dependent change in regional body fat distribution and its metabolic consequence. The pathophysiologic features of polycystic ovary syndrome, which has important clinical sequelae, deserve further consideration.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of ultrasonography in detecting fetuses with Down syndrome in the second trimester has been the subject of considerable debate during the past 3 years. Conflicting reports have led to increasing confusion about the subject in the medical community and among the public. A review of the existing literature indicates that structural malformations that are chiefly cardiac are present in half of Down syndrome fetuses but are not consistently found during routine second-trimester ultrasonography. Although excess posterior nuchal skin-fold thickness is frequently present in infants with Down syndrome, it is also not consistently identified during second-trimester ultrasonographic examinations. Studies evaluating the efficacy of screening programs that are based on femur length shortening associated with Down syndrome have revealed markedly discrepant intercenter results. Although variations in methods may account for some of the observed variability, the magnitude of femoral shortening in Down syndrome suggests that this measurement may be only marginally useful. In summary, antenatal ultrasonography will allow for the detection of only those fetuses with Down syndrome who have multiple characteristic phenotypic features or anomalies. Moreover, current second-trimester ultrasonography does not appear to be either sensitive enough specific enough to be used as a unique Down syndrome screening modality; however, it may be a useful adjunct to maternal age and serum biochemical markers in the assignment of risk for Down syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "91336325\r", 
  ".W": "In 1986 the fetal-pelvic index was introduced as an accurate method of prospectively identifying the presence or absence of fetal-pelvic disproportion. The concept of the fetal-pelvic index is one in which the fetal head and abdominal circumferences (ultrasonographic mensuration) are compared with the respective maternal pelvic inlet and midpelvic circumferences (x-ray pelvimetry). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of this index as a predictor of fetal-pelvic disproportion in gravid women attempting vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery. Findings of the fetal-pelvic index are compared with those of two other means of identifying fetal-pelvic disproportion (Colcher-Sussman x-ray pelvimetry and ultrasonographically derived estimated fetal weight of greater than or equal to 4000 gm). Of the 65 prospective study participants, 18 (28%) failed to progress in labor, and a repeat cesarean delivery was required. Forty-seven of the 52 patients with a negative fetal-pelvic index value were delivered vaginally (negative predictability = 0.90). Of the five with false-negative fetal-pelvic index values, four fetuses persisted in an occipitoposterior position and failed to progress in labor. All 13 patients with a positive fetal-pelvic index value failed to progress in labor and required a cesarean delivery (positive predictability = 1.00). In contrast, when used alone, neither x-ray pelvimetry nor ultrasonography-determined estimated fetal weight of greater than or equal to 4000 gm provided accurate identification of fetal-pelvic disproportion.\r"

  ".U": "91336327\r", 
  ".W": "The rate of decline of CA 125 in effectively treated epithelial ovarian cancer is described by the exponential regression curve CA 125 = EXP [i - s (days after surgery)]. In this equation i, the y-axis intercept, measures initial tumor burden whereas s, the slope of the regression curve, is determined by the extent of cytoreductive surgery and the subsequent response to chemotherapy. Departure from the regression curve uniformly results in progressive disease. In patients whose cancers had been completely removed, we calculated the mean half-life of CA 125 to be 10.4 days (range 4 to 21). In this case s = 0.0835 and characterizes the ideal regression rate. The model predicts that high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy (s = 0.0671) is more effective than low-dose cisplatin (s = 0.0380) (p less than 0.03) in eliminating residual cancer. Because s can be calculated within 2 to 3 months of treatment and then compared with s for the ideal regression curve and with the values of s reported for standard chemotherapy, evaluation of any new treatment protocol can be facilitated with this method.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 100,000 cesarean sections are performed each year in the United States because of breech presentation. Numerous studies have shown that external cephalic version can eliminate the need for many of these operations. However, because of the fear of uterine rupture, these studies have generally excluded patients who have undergone previous cesarean section. To evaluate the validity of this exclusion policy, we studied patients with one or more previous cesarean sections and breach presentations near term. Version attempts were successful in 82% of 56 patients who had undergone a previous cesarean section. Sixty-five percent of the successful version patients went on to have vaginal birth after cesarean section. There were no serious maternal or fetal complications associated with the version attempts. We conclude that external cephalic version is a reasonable option in patients with prior low transverse cesarean section.\r"

  ".W": "Antenatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections are associated with both maternal and neonatal morbidity. Erythromycin, the only drug recommended for treatment during pregnancy, is often poorly tolerated, thus preventing successful cure. We have done a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the efficacy of clindamycin with that of erythromycin base in eradication of antenatal chlamydia. A total of 126 patients with documented cervical infection were enrolled before 24 weeks' gestation to receive clindamycin (450 mg), erythromycin (333 mg), or placebo orally four times daily for 14 days. Partners received doxycycline, 100 mg, twice daily for 7 days. Both clindamycin and erythromycin were effective agents with cure rates of 92.7% and 83.8%, respectively. Erythromycin therapy was associated with significantly more gastrointestinal complaints than was placebo therapy (23.1% (9/39) vs. 2.4% (1/41), p less than 0.02) whereas clindamycin was not. Patients who experienced side effects were more likely to be poorly compliant (p less than 0.03) and patients with moderate-to-good compliance were more likely to be cured than were women who were poorly compliant (p less than 0.002). Results of test of cure cultures performed immediately on completion of therapy did not differ significantly from those taken 4 weeks later.\r"

In this study prenatal ultrasonographic findings were correlated with postnatal outcome in 63 fetuses with suspected hydronephrosis. Prenatal ultrasonographic measurements included length, anteroposterior diameter, and transverse diameter of the kidney and renal pelvis, as well as dorsal renal parenchymal thickness. In 45 of the 63 fetuses, hydronephrosis was confirmed postnatally. These infants were divided into two groups on the basis of renal status: (1) abnormal renal function and/or surgery required (n = 31) and (2) normal renal function with no surgery required (n = 14). The anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis was the simplest and most sensitive technique for prenatal diagnosis of congenital hydronephrosis, allowing identification of 100% of cases. Postnatal follow-up studies are warranted if an anteroposterior pelvic diameter is greater than or equal to 4 mm before 33 weeks or greater than or equal to 7 mm after 33 weeks.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the relationship of human papillomavirus (by cervicovaginal lavage and Southern blot), human immunodeficiency virus, and squamous intraepithelial lesions in 96 high-risk women in the Bronx, New York. Antibodies for human immunodeficiency virus were detected in 51 (53%) women. Of the 33 women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, 23 (70%) had human papillomavirus infection compared with 4 of 18 (22%) asymptomatic women who were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and 10 of 45 (22%) uninfected women (p less than 0.0001). The rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions was 52% (14 of 27) for women with both viruses detected, 18% (6 of 34) for women with either virus detected, and 9% (3 of 35) for uninfected women. Among symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, a strong association between human papillomavirus infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions was demonstrated (odds ratio, 12; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 108). Risk was highest for younger women from ethnic or racial minority groups. Advanced human immunodeficiency virus-related disease, with its associated immunosuppression, seems to exacerbate human papillomavirus-mediated cervical cytologic abnormalities. Public health measures are needed to provide Papanicolaou smear screening and appropriate clinical follow-up and treatment for women at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

Using the same criteria for stress (according to the Social Readjustment Rating Scale of Holmes and Rahe), we studied 86 white mothers with singleton pregnancies and with no known medical or obstetric risk factors for reduced birth weight. After strict randomization, data were analyzed for 43 mothers who received psychosocial support between enrollment at +/- 20 weeks and delivery at +/- 38 weeks and for 43 control mothers who received standard care at the antenatal clinic. In the supported group seven infants weighed less than 3000 gm at birth versus 18 control infants (p = 0.008), and analysis revealed that this effect was more the result of improved intrauterine growth than of prolongation of pregnancy. These findings are of little clinical relevance as far as the neonate is concerned, but they do indicate that psychosocial support has a significant effect on birth weight. It is possible that previous studies that have looked only for an effect on low- or very-low-birth-weight rates might have missed this clinically measurable benefit of counseling.\r"
