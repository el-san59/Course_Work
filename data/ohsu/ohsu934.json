  ".W": "Doppler echocardiography was used to study the function of bioprosthetic heart valves by noninvasive means in 32 patients aged 29 to 72 years at various postoperative intervals. There were 24 Ionescu-Shiley, four Hancock, and four Carpentier-Edwards prostheses, 19 in the aortic and 13 in the mitral position. Initial studies were performed at a mean of 2.3 years after implantation and were repeated one, two, and three years thereafter. Flow velocities in the mitral orifice, left ventricular outflow tract, and ascending aorta, as well as mitral pressure half-time, were measured from pulsed-wave or continuous-wave Doppler recordings. Mitral and aortic valve areas and aortic pressure gradients were calculated. In aortic prostheses the valve area decreased and pressure gradient increased progressively in relation to the time from implantation. The mean value (+/- SD) of the aortic valve area was 67 +/- 17 percent of the manufacturer's nominal value at the first examination and 57 +/- 20 percent one year later, 51 +/- 14 percent two years later, and 46 +/- 11 percent three years later (overall differences, p less than 0.01). In mitral prostheses, reduction of the valve area was not related to the time from implantation. The mean mitral valve area was 45 +/- 12 percent of the nominal value at rest and increased to 68 +/- 18 percent during exercise at a mean of 45 months after implantation. There was no change in these values at the one-year repeat study. It is concluded that in a population with predominantly pericardial bioprostheses, (1) aortic tissue prostheses showed a progressive functional deterioration demonstrable by Doppler echocardiography, most probably due to degenerative changes; and (2) in mitral tissue prostheses, there was no significant reduction of orifice area in relation to time from implantation. Reduction of mitral valve areas may, to some extent, reflect a less than full opening at rest.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiac status of 64 children (ages 0.2 to 18 yr) with sickle cell anemia documented by hemoglobin electrophoresis was evaluated by echocardiography. Left atrial, left ventricular and aortic root dimensions were significantly increased in over 60 percent of these children at all ages compared to values for 99 normal black (non-SCA) control subjects. Left ventricular wall thickness was increased in only 20 percent of older children with sickle cell anemia. Estimated LV mass/m2 and left ventricular cardiac index were increased compared to control subjects (p less than 0.001). Left heart abnormalities expressed as a single composite function, derived from multivariate regression analysis, correlated well with severity of anemia expressed as grams of hemoglobin (r = -0.52, p = less than 0.001) and with percentage of hemoglobin S (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001), but not to the same extent with age. Echocardiographically assessed left ventricular function at rest was comparable to that of control subjects. These data suggest that the major cardiac abnormalities in children are related to the volume overload effects of chronic anemia, and that in this age group, there is no evidence for a distinct \"sickle cell cardiomyopathy\" or cardiac dysfunction.\r"

The acute changes of aortic blood flow profiles during the Valsalva maneuver were investigated on a basis of beat-to-beat estimation. During the active strain phase (phase 2), group 1 showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure, SV and CO with reflex tachycardia; in group 2, there was a significant decrease in SV and CO with reflex tachycardia, but not systolic blood pressure. The percentage decreases in SV and CO in group 2 were significantly less than those in group 1 (23 +/- 16 percent vs 48 +/- 10 percent for SV, p less than 0.01; 17 +/- 12 percent vs 40 +/- 13 percent for CO, p less than 0.05). After release of strain phase (phase 4), group 1 showed significant reversed changes in systolic blood pressure, SV and heart rate, indicating an overshoot effect which was, however, not observed in group 2. Thus, patients with ASD presented abnormal Valsalva response which was characterized by the absence of phase 4 overshoot and a less marked phase 2 change. The findings suggest that the decremental effect of impaired venous return on stroke output during active strain may be attenuated by the increased pulmonary blood volume due to left-to-right shunt. In patients with ASD, the lesser decrement of CO during phase 2 may not provoke sufficient sympathetic activity to induce overshoot response in phase 4.\r"

Compared with an age-matched normal control group, both A and B groups exhibited lower MIP, significantly greater EMGd and EMGint, and lower Po.1/EMGd ratio. However, a similar pattern, along with a rapid and shallow breathing, differentiated group B from group A. In group B we found a significant direct relationship between Po.1/EMGd ratio and MIP, and an inverse relationship between PaCO2 and Po.1/EMGd ratio. These data seem to indicate the following: (1) EMG is a more precise method than Po.1 in assessing the magnitude of the NRD; (2) NRD is increased in these patients; and (3) clinical manifestations probably associated with inspiratory muscle fatigue (marked decrease in muscle strength, rapid and shallow breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation) may be accompanied by a greater NRD and a more marked derangement in chest wall neuromuscular coupling in COPD.\r"

Patients with squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, or small-cell carcinomas were eligible. This study did not consider smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer, as all subjects had a confirmed diagnosis. We were interested in smoking history and the pattern of smoking among those whose risk was 100 percent. Among these patients, we confirmed that a larger subset of nonsmoking individuals developed adenocarcinomas than squamous cell or small-cell carcinomas; however, the duration and intensity of cigarette smoking, as measured by pack-years, were not determinants of tumor cell type in male patients. Small-cell carcinomas in women were more strongly associated with cigarette smoking than either squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. More than 3,500 different substances have been measured in tobacco smoke, including tumor initiators, promoters, and those involved in tumor progression. These data confirm the hypothesis that factors other than cigarette smoking are more likely to be involved in the initiation of adenocarcinomas than other cell types. Endogenous and exogenous factors related to gender may be more important than the duration or intensity of cigarette smoking.\r"

There was no difference between both control days when PEFR at 1 h was compared with baseline PEFR and when PEFR at 4 to 13 hours was compared with baseline PEFR. After analyzing variation coefficients of baseline PEFR on a control day and exercise day, PEFR was not allowed to differ more than 15.3 percent in the same patient when comparing exercise day and control day for the late fall in PEFR in the study. In 17 of 81 patients, a late asthmatic reaction after exercise challenge was present when PEFR fall was greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value. In eight of the 17 patients, a real late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge was present with a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent on at least three successive time points and who had a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with corresponding clocktime on a control day. The late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge is characterized not as a nonspecific epiphenomenon, but as a fall in PEFR of greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value and with corresponding clocktime on a control day on at least three successive time points. Graphic illustration of airway responses following exercises may facilitate the detection of a late asthmatic response.\r"

Physician estimates of cardiac index were found to be sufficiently accurate in patients without acute heart disease that initial management without invasive monitoring may be appropriate in selected cases. However, due to the general inaccuracy of physician estimates, efforts to improve the accuracy of clinical judgments of cardiac function and hemodynamic status should be pursued with vigor in patients both with and without acute cardiac dysfunction.\r"

There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age and LVEF. Values of RVEF were 47 +/- 6 percent and 31 +/- 6 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05). The RVEF had no influence on the prevalence and complexity of early and late arrhythmias. Stratification of patients in group B into two subgroups based on the extent of RV dysfunction did not reveal any differences in the occurrence of all forms of ectopy (when both groups were matched to group A). Therefore, patients with inferior AMI, with or without RV infarction, have a similar prevalence of arrhythmias. Ventricular ectopic beats may be related to the severity and spread of LV involvement, rather than to RV dysfunction.\r"

The study took place in a 12-bed medical respiratory intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital. Twenty-one patients had OLT performed over a 21.5-month period (January 1988 to October 15, 1989) for end stage liver disease (ESLD) from a variety of causes. A flow-directed right heart catheter and an indwelling arterial cannula were inserted for hemodynamic monitoring over a 96-hour postoperative period. Liver and renal function studies, total serum calcium, serum albumin, and fluid balance were determined daily. The SVR increased significantly to 12.8 +/- 0.6 U at 48 hours compared with immediate (less than 8 hours) postoperative levels (p less than 0.05) and remained elevated for 96 hours. The CO fell progressively and was significantly lower than baseline values from 64 to 96 hours. There was significant inverse correlation between the increase in SVR and the fall in CO (r = .85, p less than 0.01). The SBP was stable except for a small, but significant fall at 16 and 24 hours postoperatively. The PWP increased significantly from a baseline value of 12.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg to 15 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at 32 hours and remained elevated through 96 hours (p less than 0.05). The serum bilirubin level fell progressively postoperatively and the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) shortened significantly. Bile flow increased progressively from 107 +/- 120 ml/24 hours at the end of the first 24 hours to 188 +/- 125 ml/24 hours by 96 hours postoperatively. Five patients died from nine to 43 days postoperatively. These patients' hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different from the patients who survived. Successful OLT is associated with a rapid increase in SVR and a fall in CO without changes in SBP. These findings tend to parallel the improvement found in results of liver function tests. However, there is no correlation between the improvement in the hemodynamic state and long-term survival.\r"

Hemodynamic data were obtained with radial and pulmonary artery catheters. Edema fluid was obtained along with blood samples for simultaneous determination of protein and albumin content. All patients studied had normal or high cardiac output, normal cardiac filling pressures, and edema fluid protein to serum protein ratio of 0.6 or greater suggestive of permeability changes contributing to edema fluid accumulation. Calculated shunt fraction exceeded 25 percent in all patients. Pulmonary edema has been noted in patients following pulmonary resection in the early postoperative period. In patients reviewed here, two factors appeared to be significant. First is an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure associated with passage of a normal to high cardiac output in a reduced volume pulmonary vascular bed. The second factor, as demonstrated by protein content in the edema fluid, is injury to the alveolar capillary membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is uniquely suited for the study of large airway lesions in the ventilated premature infant. However, no standardized clinical scoring system of distal tracheal injury exists and the adverse consequences of FB in ventilated premature infants are not well described. Using a prototype Olympus fiberoptic ultrathin bronchoscope with a directable tip and an outer diameter of 2.2 mm, we serially scored distal tracheal injury in conventionally ventilated premature infants on the basis of mucosal and obstructive changes observed at bronchoscopy. In addition, we prospectively evaluated the incidence of adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary effects during, immediately after, and within 1 h of FB. We performed 21 FBs in eight conventionally ventilated premature infants with birth weight of 1,239 +/- 438 g and gestational age of 30 +/- 3 weeks. The carina and mainstem bronchi were easily visualized in all infants using the prototype bronchoscope. During the first several days of life, moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury occurred frequently, while moderate-to-severe obstructive injury occurred infrequently. Distal mucosal injury appeared to improve during the fourth week of life. Mild distal obstructive injury began to appear during the second week of life. Adverse consequences of FB observed in our patient population included transient hypoxemia and bradycardia during FB, changes in systolic blood pressure immediately and within 1 h after FB, and emesis immediately after FB. Serious adverse cardiovascular or pulmonary effects were not observed. We conclude that FB can be performed safely with appropriate monitoring and is a useful tool in the clinical assessment and serial evaluation of distal tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants. We speculate that moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury may be associated with the development of later obstructive injury. On the basis of this preliminary study, further prospective investigations of tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants appear to be warranted.\r"

One monoclonal antibody (IHY-1) that reacted with the epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas on immunoperoxidase technique was selected. The immunoperoxidase technique was used to compare this monoclonal antibody's binding to sarcoidosis- or tuberculosis-affected lymph nodes. IHY-1 is a monoclonal antibody of IgM class. This antibody did not react to erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, alveolar macrophages, or the macrophage-derived cell lines such as U-973 and KG-1. It reacted to granuloma epithelioid cells of sarcoidosis-affected lymph nodes. The monoclonal antibody also reacted positively to epithelioid cells in tuberculous granulomas although the reaction was not as strong. Since IHY-1 was found to bind to both types of granulomas, this suggests that the epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis have antigenicity common to the epithelioid cells in tuberculosis.\r"

  ".U": "91030747\r", 
  ".W": "Right ventricular (RV) ejection fractions have been difficult to estimate clinically. It has been demonstrated recently that RV ejection fractions can be calculated by thermodilution techniques using a rapid response thermistor and computer. This method critically depends on adequate mixing of the thermal bolus and sensing of the rapid response thermistor. This study examined the effects of the thermistor position within the pulmonary artery and injectate site within the right atrium on RV thermodilution ejection fraction measurements. Ten pigs were instrumented with a RV thermodilution catheter in the pulmonary artery, an injectate catheter in the right atrium, an atrial-pacing electrode, and a systemic arterial catheter. The RV ejection fractions were determined using thermodilution in two ways: (1) with incremental increases in pulmonic valve to thermistor distance, and (2) with incremental increases in injectate port to tricuspid valve. These measurements were obtained at a paced rate of 107 +/- 1 beats per minute (bpm) and then repeated with pacing-induced tachycardia (140 bpm). The highest RV ejection fraction with the lowest coefficient of variation was with the thermistor 2 cm from the pulmonic valve (50 +/- 2 percent), with a significant decline from this value at 10 cm (42 +/- 4 percent, p less than 0.05). This reduction in RV ejection fraction values with increased pulmonic valve to thermistor distance became more pronounced with tachycardia where a significant decline in RV ejection fraction occurred at 4 cm from the valve when compared with 0 cm (38 +/- 6 percent vs 47 +/- 3 percent, respectively, p less than 0.05). There was no significant change in RV ejection fraction at any injectate port to tricuspid valve distance at the lower heart rate. With tachycardia, however, a significant decline in RV ejection fraction occurred with the injectate port located 7 cm from the tricuspid valve (p less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that RV ejection fractions can be reliably obtained using thermodilution. Positioning of the thermodilution catheter is an important consideration for obtaining optimal RV ejection fraction measurements. Care should be taken to position the catheter with the thermistor a minimal distance from the pulmonic valve and the injectate port within the central body of the right atrium.\r"

Once a sinus impulse was blocked in the accessory pathway, the block (ie, loss of preexcitation) was continued for a while until a PP interval reached or exceeded a critical period inducing sudden reappearance of preexcitation. This critical period was considerably longer than the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway. These findings are explained by the use of the concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap in the accessory pathway. It seems that when loss of protection was maintained, the sinus impulse was blocked at the site proximal to the gap, but the impulse passing through the atrioventricular node always reached retrogradely the site distal to the gap, and therefore, the next sinus impulse was blocked again.\r"

Since the patient's lung disease had necessitated a large amount of ventilatory support, the patient was unable to increase VE appropriately to handle excess CO2. Peritoneal dialysate was an additional source of carbohydrates. Peritoneal dialysate is an additional carbohydrate source that may result in hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis in patients with respiratory compromise. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in an adult which demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis with high glucose loads produced an acute respiratory acidosis that was reversed by decreasing the glucose concentrations in the dialysate. Excess CO2 production should be considered with respiratory disorders associated with dialysis.\r"

Lymph node clearance has been used at the institution since 1977, and this retrospective analysis was undertaken to ascertain its validity there. Furthermore, the node positive group was evaluated to ascertain if the current staging system (Turnbull, 1967) is prognostically accurate for the Dukes' C group. Specifically evaluated for possible prognostic variance was the survival of those patients whose tumors demonstrated partial bowel wall penetration and only one to four positive nodes, a \"C1 subset,\" previously reported to have favorable prognosis. Eight hundred sixty-four cases of colon and rectal cancer treated surgically from 1977 to 1982 were analyzed. There was a mean of 27 lymph nodes retrieved per specimen and a mean of 4.5 positive nodes per Dukes' C specimen. There were 43 C1 and 201 C2 cases with five-year survival rates of 73 and 38 percent, respectively. The results of chemical clearance at Ferguson Hospital were found to be comparable with that of other centers using chemical clearance and superior to hand dissection. The C1 subset clearly is noted to have prognostic advantage and should occupy a separate designation in any staging system.\r"

Twenty-five of the patients with polyps (29 percent) had no polyps distal to the splenic flexure; these proximal polyps (and two carcinomas) would have been missed on screening with fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy. Nineteen of these 25 patients had polyps smaller than 0.5 cm, which likely would have been missed with contrast enemas. Almost one half (47 percent) of all polyps discovered at screening colonoscopy were proximal to the descending colon. Only one patient younger than 40 years old had adenomas. The yield of polyps and cancer in patients with familial risk indicates screening colonoscopy should be considered after age 40.\r"

To clarify the success of aggressive drainage and the subsequent clinical course of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscesses, the authors reviewed the records of 38 patients who presented with this condition during an eight-year period. Twenty-two male and 16 female patients (median age, 32 years; range, 17 to 61 years) with clinically or pathologically confirmed Crohn's disease of the bowel underwent operation for perirectal abscesses. Thirty-two percent of patients had no previous history of anorectal Crohn's disease. Thirty simple abscesses and 8 complex horseshoe abscesses were treated. At operation, 53 percent of patients underwent incision and drainage whereas 26 percent received loop indwelling drains and 21 percent had mushroom catheters placed. After resolution of the index abscess, recurrent abscesses occurred in 45 percent of the patients who underwent catheter drainage and 56 percent of the patients who underwent incision and drainage. More importantly, 44 percent of the incision and drainage group and only 31 percent of the catheter drainage group required subsequent proctectomy to control perineal sepsis. The healing time of the perineal wound was longer than six months in 83 percent of patients requiring rectal excision. We concluded that long-term catheter drainage may offer substantial benefit in the overall outcome of the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscess.\r"

Fifteen percent of patients were Dukes' A stage, 32 percent were Dukes' B, 25 percent were Dukes' C, and 29 percent were Dukes' D. At five years after diagnosis, the observed survival rate was 36 percent and the adjusted rate was 42 percent. Dukes' staging was a highly discriminating factor in survival (P less than 0.001). Survival rates were better in women than in men and better for patients with colon cancer than for patients with rectal cancer. Survival by Dukes' staging was not affected by colon subsite or by the tumor being the first and single tumor, metachronous tumor, or synchronous tumor. The survival of younger patients was better for Dukes' stages A, B, and C, and worse for Dukes' D. Survival was worse in the presence of bowel perforation in Dukes' C and D stages. Within Dukes' D (incurable cases), survival was best in the absence of hepatic metastases, slightly worse when only hepatic metastases were present, and poorest in the presence of both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Statistical modeling of survival determinants other than staging indicated that cell differentiation had the largest effect (survival decreasing with poor cell differentiation), followed by site (survival worse for rectal cancer than colon cancer), then age (survival better for younger patients), while bowel perforation had the smallest effect on survival.\r"

Between 1960 and 1984, 137 children with chronic ulcerative colitis underwent surgery (mean duration of follow-up, 7.1 years). In 91 patients, the procedures were a total proctocolectomy with ileostomy or Kock pouch (66) or a lesser colectomy with either an ileostomy (16) or an ileorectal anastomosis (9) (group I). Forty-six patients underwent an ileoanal anastomosis procedure (group II). Children in group I were more likely to have significant preoperative loss of weight, a debilitated condition, and malnutrition. Urgent or emergency surgical intervention was required in 25 percent of patients in group I but in only 4 percent of patients in group II. Trends included 1) a younger age at operation in group II, 2) a higher mortality in group I (7.7 percent) than group II (0 percent), and 3) a higher perioperative mortality with emergency operations (23 percent) than elective procedures (1.6 percent). In group I, 98 percent of patients had an abdominal ostomy, but no patients in group II had an abdominal ostomy. The children with an ileoanal anastomosis had an average of 4.8 stools during waking hours and 1.3 stools each night. On the basis of this experience, the authors recommend use of the ileoanal anastomosis procedure in the surgical treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis in children.\r"

Collagen content per unit wet or dry weight of tissue was significantly increased in all grossly diseased tissue whether fistulated or not. Although there was a significant increase in collagen types I, III, and V in diseased tissue, the relative proportions of major collagen types extracted by limited pepsin digestion were similar for both Crohn's and non-Crohn's intestine (type I, 65 to 70 percent; type III, 25 to 30 percent; type IV, 2 to 3 percent; and type V, 2.5 to 3 percent). CNBr digestion of pepsin insoluble material showed a similar relative abundance of types I and III, indicating no major change in collagen type distribution between older (insoluble) and more newly synthesized collagen. There was no evidence of the presence of type I trimer collagen. Type VI collagen, although not quantitated, was observed in 70 percent of intestinal specimens. The proportion of total collagen solubilized by pepsin treatment was significantly greater in both grossly diseased and macroscopically normal Crohn's bowel compared with non-inflammatory bowel disease bowel. These findings suggest that there are disturbances of collagen metabolism in Crohn's intestine, which account for the stricturing process and which may predate gross pathologic changes.\r"

Enteroglucagon (EG) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), two hormones believed to play a relevant role in the adaptive response to bowel resection, were investigated using a specific radioimmunoassay in basal conditions and after a standard meal. Pouch patients showed a statistically significant increase in basal levels of both enteroglucagon and PYY compared with control subjects (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.001, respectively). The response of enteroglucagon to food ingestion, evaluated by means of the total integrated response, was similar in patients and controls. Conversely, the response of PYY was significantly increased in pouch patients compared with control cases (P less than 0.02). Results of this investigation suggest that gut hormones may be involved in mediating the adaptive response of the intestine to pouch construction. Changes of gut peptides may explain, at least in part, the functional results observed after pouch construction.\r"

The outcome was more favorable in the group with nipple valve anastomosis, i.e., longer interval between surgery and symptomatic relapse, and tendency to less frequent recurrence and re-resection. An association was found between radiologically preserved nipple valve and remission, and two patients with intact valve at long-term follow-up remained symptom-free. The observations implied that protection of the terminal ileum from coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease may favorably influence the prognosis.\r"

All subjects received antacids, and these substances were also measured. During relapse, all patients showed raised noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol values. In contrast, platelet serotonin showed very low values, which correlated negatively with all the former, except free serotonin. No correlations were found in parameters of the controls. After healing, significant reductions of noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol and significant increases of platelet serotonin values were observed. However, only dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol reached normal values. Noradrenaline and adrenaline remained higher and platelet serotonin lower, both significantly more so than normals. These still-altered parameters showed similar correlations to those found during relapses. The present results demonstrate that some baseline autonomic system imbalance exists in patients, amplified and accentuated during relapse. We discuss the possibility that stress plays some role in triggering duodenal ulcer relapse.\r"

  ".W": "An investigation of cytoprotective activity of certain antacids and inert particles was carried out by treating ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in rats in order to clarify possible mechanisms by which aluminum-containing antacids act. Al(OH)3 inhibited gastric mucosal damage in a dose-related and time-dependent manner. Neither aluminum ions themselves nor the particle size of the Al(OH)3 complex were responsible for the observed cytoprotection, since neither AlCl3, chemically inert Al2O3*C, nor sea sand showed protective effects. Hyperosmolality in the gastric lumen was not a deciding factor in inducing cytoprotection. Silicic acid and titanium dioxide, with superficial charge similar to Al(OH)3 proved to be effective in inhibiting gastric hemorrhagic lesions and releasing PGE2, suggesting that the surface charge of Al(OH)3 may be important in its cytoprotective properties. The same may also be valid for sucralfate. Since antacid-induced cytoprotection was only partly reduced by pretreatment with indomethacin, it is likely that additional mechanisms and mediators other than prostaglandins, such as nonprotein sulfhydryls, also are involved in gastric cytoprotection arising from aluminum-containing antacids.\r"

In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen. Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl. Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats. We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the gastric effects of adenosine and its antagonist, theophylline, on secretory function, mucosal blood flow, and on ethanol-induced glandular mucosal damage in rats that were fasted for 24 hr before experimentation. The animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and their tracheae cannulated. An ex vivo stomach chamber then was prepared. The luminal bathing solution was collected every 15 min and the concentrations of H+ and Na+ were determined by a pH autotitrator and an ionmeter, respectively. The glandular mucosal blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter and the severity of lesions was determined by measuring the hemorrhagic areas. Adenosine administration (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) markedly lowered the H+ and Na+ output but increased the secretory volume and mucosal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. The same doses of the nucleoside also prevented ethanol-induced mucosal damage. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with theophylline (30 or 60 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Ethanol given alone significantly depressed the H+ and Na+ secretion. Both effects were not modified by adenosine treatment. However, the depressive action of ethanol on mucosal blood flow was prevented by adenosine. These findings indicate that adenosine modulates the physiological function of the stomach. It also directly activates the defensive mechanism of the stomach, which is partially mediated by the improvement of the gastric mucosal blood flow and an increase in the nonacid component of gastric secretion.\r"

The endoscopic distinction between early and early-like advanced cancers was correctly made in 83.6% of the cases. Among the early gastric cancers, mucosal and submucosal invasion was correctly presumed in 71.9% of the cases. When the tumor was an elevated type, or located in the antrum, the endoscopic diagnosis tended to be deeper than the true depth. The size of tumor contributed little to the depth diagnosis. Pathomorphological changes on the tips of converging folds were the important clue for diagnosing depth.\r"

A simple scanning apparatus, similar to that used in a hand-held scintillation probe, was compared with simultaneous measurements made by a gamma camera in 16 healthy males. A dual-labeled test meal was utilized to measure liquid and solid emptying simultaneously. Anterior and posterior scans were taken at intervals up to 120 min using both a gamma camera and the scintillation probe. Good relative agreement between the methods was obtained both for solid-phase (correlation range 0.92-0.99, mean 0.97) and for liquid-phase data (correlation range 0.93-0.99, mean 0.97). For solid emptying data regression line slopes varied from 0.75 to 1.03 (mean 0.84). Liquid emptying data indicated that slopes ranged from 0.71 to 1.06 (mean 0.87). These results suggested that an estimate of the gamma measurement could be obtained by multiplying the scintillation measurement by a factor of 0.84 for the solid phase and 0.87 for the liquid phase. Correlation between repeat studies was 0.97 and 0.96 for solids and liquids, respectively. The application of a hand-held probe technique provides a noninvasive and inexpensive method for accurately assessing solid- and liquid-phase gastric emptying from the human stomach that correlates well with the use of a gamma camera, within the range of gastric emptying rate in the normal individuals in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging. In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats. In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity. Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals. In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity. Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%. This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa. We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging.\r"

Eleven healthy individuals were used as controls. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) six patients had signs of marked and six moderate pancreatitis, whereas there were no pancreatitis changes in 17 of the patients. At CT scanning patients with marked pancreatitis (ERP) had significantly increased pancreatic duct diameter as compared to patients without signs of pancreatitis. The duct was visualized in 52% of all patients before and 71% after secretin stimulation the corresponding figures for healthy controls, being 18% both before and after secretin. In patients without signs of pancreatitis, it was demonstrated in 5/17 (29%) before and 11/17 (65%) after secretin, whereas it was seen in 10/12 (83%) pancreatitis patients both before and after the hormonal provocation. In five of the nonpancreatitis patients in whom the duct was measurable before and at all study intervals (10, 20, and 50 min) after secretin, there was a significant duct dilation response both at 10 min and when comparing the maximal duct diameter after secretin to the initial values. In contrast secretin did not affect the duct caliber in pancreatitis patients. Serum pancreatic amylase increased significantly after secretin administration to healthy controls and nonpancreatitis patients but was uninfluenced in the marked and moderate pancreatitis groups, respectively. However, when all pancreatitis patients were grouped together, the amylase levels were significantly elevated by secretin. In conclusion, secretin provocation caused duct dilation at CT scanning in pancreas divisum patients without signs of pancreatitis at ERP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animals were then sacrificed and tumor volume, weight, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content were evaluated. SW-1990 cells were grown in vitro and the effects of CCK, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and proglumide (a CCK-receptor antagonist) on cell number and DNA synthesis were determined. The highest dose of CCK, 25 micrograms/kg, significantly increased tumor weight, protein content, and DNA content (P less than 0.005). In vitro, CCK caused significant increases in cell counts of up to 47% at six days and 66% at 12 days compared to control. Graded concentrations of CCK had a biphasic effect on DNA synthesis with significant increases of up to 65% (P less than 0.005). CCK-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by proglumide. Secretin slightly increased cancer cell growth, although not as potently as CCK, VIP or secretin in combination with CCK did not show potentiation. These results indicate that growth of some human pancreatic cancers may be influenced by gastrointestinal peptides, of which CCK is the most potent.\r"

In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the determination of the HEF during biliary scintigraphy is helpful in distinguishing between intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease in patients with hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl).\r"

The aims of this study were to determine: (1) the number of organs donated by each of the major racial groups of the United States, (2) the outcome of transplantation of these organs across racial groups, and (3) the pattern of liver disease that required transplantation in each of these racial groups. A significantly higher proportion of organs were donated by white non-Hispanic Americans than either black or Hispanic Americans. There was no significant difference in survival when an organ was transplanted between black and white Americans and vice versa. Postnecrotic cirrhosis from a variety of causes was the most common indicator affecting black and white recipients, while primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis were uncommon in the black population. While the number of organs donated by blacks was low, it was, however, proportional to the number of black recipients in this study. Reasons for the low rate of donation by the black and white Hispanic population are discussed. It is concluded that race is not a criteria to be used in selection of donors for liver transplantation. Educational programs addressing issues of organ donation and transplantation directed towards the black and Hispanic populations are recommended.\r"

It was uncertain which blood supply has a greater effect on the recuperative process of the hepatocytes in the ischemic liver during the initial reperfusion. The ability of the liver cells to restore its energy phosphates is related to the viability of the liver. This study was designed to determine the differences of the high energy phosphate in the liver predicated upon whether reflow was first provided by either the hepatic artery or the portal vein followed by subsequent reperfusion from both vessels. The recovery of ATP upon 10 min of only hepatic arterial reperfusion after 15 min of total ischemia was much slower compared to the portal venous reperfusion only. It may be undesirable, therefore, to reperfuse the liver with hepatic arterial blood first immediately after warm liver ischemia.\r"

The female-to-male ratio of gallstones prevalence in cirrhotic patients approached to 1:1.

No difference was found, for gallstone disease prevalence in cirrhosis of different etiology. The prevalence of cholelithiasis increased from Child's A to Child's C with a significant trend (P less than 0.001); this difference was significant in males (12.3% vs 40.5%) (P less than 0.001) but not in females. This study shows that cirrhosis represents a risk factor for the development of cholelithiasis in males.

We have used a novel monoclonal antibody (AAI) against tryptase expressed exclusively in the granules of mast cells to enumerate mast cells in rectal biopsies in order to study the effect of inflammatory bowel disease and drug treatment upon rectal mast cell numbers. Rectal mast cell numbers are significantly reduced in inflammatory bowel disease patients taking corticosteroids (mean 4.95 cells/mm2) when compared with control patients (10.1, P less than 0.001) and inflammatory bowel disease patients not taking corticosteroids (9.7, P less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). The reduction in mast cell counts was independent of the degree of inflammation or architectural distortion. There was a negative correlation between the dose of corticosteroids and mast cell count (r = 0.53, P less than 0.05 Spearman rank correlation), and the mast cell count was reduced within a few days of treatment and remained low throughout steroid therapy. Mucosal mast cell depletion may be an important mechanism of action of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

A hierarchical sequence of therapies is proposed in which the major aim is to maintain near-normal fasting blood glucose concentrations, in the expectation that this will help prevent development of long-term complications. When diet and tablet therapy are no longer effective in keeping the fasting blood glucose level less than 6 mM, a basal insulin supplement from a long-acting insulin such as ultralente can be added. When monitored by fasting blood glucose concentration, there is little risk of hypoglycemia, and the patient can continue a normal life-style without restrictions concerning exercise or the size of individual meals. A basal insulin supplement does not induce marked weight gain. The dose of insulin required can be predicted from the level of the fasting blood glucose and the degree of obesity, which provides an index of the accompanying insulin resistance. Based on current evidence, insulin therapy is equally appropriate in patients with insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, because the benefit from maintaining near-normal glucose concentrations probably outweighs a putative risk of hyperinsulinemia. In more severely affected patients, additional regular insulin to cover meals is needed. Lowering fasting blood glucose to normal with a basal insulin supplement reduces endogenous insulin production, and this may be advantageous if accompanying production of islet amyloid polypeptide and islet amyloid formation are also reduced.\r"

Liposomes are an effective means of delivering insulin specifically to hepatocytes. The usefulness of hepatically targeted liposomes in the treatment of diabetes is restricted due to the requirement that they be given intravenously, the dilute concentration of insulin present in liposomal preparations, and the cost associated with liposome production. Encapsulating insulin in liposomes results in enhanced oral absorption of insulin. The high doses of liposome-entrapped insulin required perorally, coupled with extreme variability in the glycemic response to peroral liposomes, limits the value of peroral liposomal insulin as a viable diabetic therapy. Insulin action can be sustained via encapsulation of insulin in liposomes given subcutaneously. Most insulin appears to remain at the injection site, and the presence of a lipid matrix for subcutaneous insulin delivery raises concerns over enhanced antigenicity of liposomal insulin given subcutaneously. Viewed in the light of the limitations outlined above, the contribution of liposomal insulin to understanding and treatment of diabetes mellitus will probably be via use of hepatically targeted liposomes as a pharmacological probe to decipher the role of the liver in the metabolic complications associated with diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Due to the inherent pharmacokinetic properties of available insulins, normoglycemia is rarely, if ever, achieved in insulin-dependent diabetic patients without compromising their quality of life. Subcutaneous insulin absorption is influenced by many factors, among which the associated state of insulin (hexameric) in pharmaceutical formulation may be of importance. This review describes the development of a series of human insulin analogues with reduced tendency to self-association that, because of more rapid absorption, are better suited to meal-related therapy. DNA technology has made it possible to prepare insulins that remain dimeric or even monomeric at high concentration by introducing one or a few amino acid substitutions into human insulin. These analogues were characterized and used for elucidating the mechanisms involved in subcutaneous absorption and were investigated in preliminary clinical studies. Their relative receptor binding and in vitro potency (free-fat cell assay), ranging from 0.05 to 600% relative to human insulin, were strongly correlated (r = 0.97). In vivo, most of the analogues exhibited approximately 100% activity, explainable by a dominating receptor-mediated clearance. This was confirmed by clamp studies in which correlation between receptor binding and clearance was observed. Thus, an analogue with reduced binding and clearance gives higher circulating concentrations, counterbalancing the reduced potency at the cellular level. Absorption studies in pigs revealed a strong inverse correlation (r = 0.96) between the rate of subcutaneous absorption and the mean association state of the insulin analogues. These studies also demonstrated that monomeric insulins were absorbed three times faster than human insulin. In healthy subjects, rates of disappearance from subcutis were two to three times faster for dimeric and monomeric analogues than for human insulin. Concomitantly, a more rapid rise in plasma insulin concentration and an earlier hypoglycemic response with the analogues were observed. The monomeric insulin had no lag phase and followed a monoexponential course throughout the absorption process. In contrast, two phases in rate of absorption were identified for the dimer and three for the normal hexameric human insulin. The initial lag phase and the subsequent accelerated absorption of soluble insulin can now be explained by the associated state of native insulin in pharmaceutical formulation and its progressive dissociation into smaller units during the absorption process. In the light of these results, the effects of insulin concentration, injected volume, temperature, and massage on the absorption process are now also understood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this review is to describe the rationale and methods for better use of injection and infusion devices for intensive insulin therapy and to describe results of animal and human research that will lead to an implantable artificial pancreas. Injection devices, e.g., jet injectors, insulin pens, and access ports, cannot be considered as a major breakthrough in the quest for improved control, although they may improve the patient's comfort. External pumps have benefits over multiple injections and conventional insulin therapy only in specific subgroups of patients, e.g., those with recurrent severe hypoglycemia, but only when used by experienced personnel. The external artificial pancreas (Biostator) is also to be used by experienced personnel for limited clinical and research applications, e.g., surgery of the diabetic patient. The development of an implantable version of the artificial pancreas is linked to progress in the field of reliable long-duration glucose sensors. Finally, programmable implantable insulin pumps, used as an open-loop delivery system, are the most promising alternative to intensive subcutaneous insulin strategies in the short term, although clear evidence of improved safety and efficacy remains to be documented.\r"

Surgery, especially in the presence of general anesthesia, will produce a diabetogenic response. This is generally due to an elevation of counterregulatory hormones, although endogenous insulin is also suppressed. The excessive lipolysis and ketogenesis that can occur during surgery can have particularly deleterious effects for patients with diabetes. Thus, sufficient insulin must be provided during this period to suppress these catabolic processes. The major controversy regarding surgery and diabetes concerns the route of insulin administration. This article reviews the various treatment options for patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, with particular emphasis on the role of insulin. Special situations, e.g., outpatient surgery, coronary artery bypass, and emergency surgery, are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. This review focuses on the beta-cell, what defects occur when and why. Two major anatomic observations have been made in NIDDM. The beta-cell mass is mildly reduced, especially when obesity is taken into account. Also, amyloid deposits are frequently observed in the islets. It is unclear whether these changes are genetically mediated or result secondary to the loss of glucose homeostasis. Many studies have looked at some aspect of insulin secretion in NIDDM, and two types of distinct abnormalities have been described. Early on, there is a marked disruption in pulsatile insulin delivery, which is potentially an important contributor to the insulin resistance. It is unclear whether the loss of pulsatile delivery is acquired or genetically induced. Later, after glucose intolerance has started, several other secretory abnormalities develop coincident with loss of beta-cell glucorecognition. The net result is further deterioration in timing of insulin delivery and postprandial hyperglycemia. A second important consequence of the glucose blindness is that the inherent compensatory beta-cell mechanisms that guard against hyperglycemia are bypassed. We propose that the loss of glucose responsiveness is a direct result of an elevated glucose concentration (so-called glucotoxicity) and have generated substantial data in rat models that support this idea. The logical conclusion is that beta-cell function in NIDDM can be maximized by achieving the best metabolic control possible.\r"

This occurs as the blood alcohol concentration is increasing and is due to the suppression by alcohol of the endogenous release of ADH. During a steady blood alcohol concentration, alcohol acts as an antidiuretic, causing retention of water and electrolytes. While at steady state, additional doses of alcohol will produce progressively smaller and eventually absent diuretic responses. The chronic effect of alcohol is to promote isosmotic retention of water and electrolytes due to increased ADH levels. Excess water and electrolytes are acutely excreted in response to additional alcohol ingestion. With the cessation of alcohol intake, this excess will be excreted over several days. Routine parenteral fluid administration to chronic and withdrawing alcoholics should be avoided. The role of potassium and magnesium in the genesis of specific manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is not clear. Alcoholic patients may have electrolyte abnormalities due to alcohol-induced diseases, poor nutrition, or vomiting and diarrhea. Each case must be individually evaluated.\r"

This familiarity must not obscure the fact that a significant minority of these patients will have an underlying process that can cause morbidity or mortality if the unsuspecting physician does not have an organized and methodic approach to the evaluation and management of the seizing alcoholic patient. Status epilepticus should be evaluated and treated in a similar fashion, whether or not the patient is an alcoholic. Otherwise, almost without exception, there are nuances and controversies with respect to the evaluation and management of the alcoholic patient with a seizure(s), from the indications for CT scan, to the proper role of sedatives and anticonvulsants, and the need for admission. The emergency physician must remain a patient advocate. The great majority of alcoholic patients with seizures who require admission can be treated satisfactorily at the hospital of presentation.\r"

  ".W": "Neurologic and myopathic complications of alcoholism are multiple and diverse, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the ED, initial concern is for diagnosing readily reversible causes and ruling out possible life- or limb-threatening etiologies. A rapid assessment of the ABCs, a fingerstick blood glucose determination, and, in cases of AMS, the administration of intravenous naloxone is indicated. In almost every instance of a potential neurologic complication, intravenous thiamine replacement is indicated initially, along with the parenteral administration of folic acid and the other B vitamins, including nicotinic acid and pyridoxine. Metabolic screening with electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes (AST, alkaline phosphatase), bilirubin, arterial blood gases with carboxyhemoglobin determination, and a complete blood count are often warranted. Special tests such as CT scan, CK, ammonia, or toxicologic screens are indicated in specific instances. In terms of physical examination, attention to the presence of focal neurologic findings is paramount because of the possibility of a subdural or epidural hematoma. It is important not to miss meningitis and a low threshold for treatment or lumbar puncture should be maintained. Specialized consultation and referral are needed only after stabilization and appropriate tests are performed. If an organized approach to the evaluation of an alcoholic with neurologic symptoms is undertaken, occult disease will not be missed and outcomes will be improved.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol has experimentally been shown to be \"ulcerogenic,\" independent of gastric intraluminal pH. Ethanol remains ulcerogenic despite antisecretory doses of H2-receptor antagonists. Low-dose alcohol stimulates acid secretion in man, an effect possibly mediated by histamine or gastrin. High-dose alcohol reduces intraluminal acid by damaging mucosa, thereby enhancing back diffusion of hydrogen ion, and also by direct damage to oxyntic (parietal) cells. Ethanol is capable of increasing gastric mucosal permeability as evidenced by the increase in back diffusion (increases intraluminal pH) and by the characteristic fall in transmucosal potential difference which reflects surface cell layer exfoliation. This exfoliation may offer an explanation for the potentiating effect of alcohol on gastric mucosal injury when it is ingested simultaneously with other gastric irritants. Ethanol of greater than 20% concentration can rapidly destroy the gastric mucus-bicarbonate layer, which may be a defense layer for both the inhibition of back diffusion and bicarbonate neutralization of existing acid. Ethanol depletes sulfhydryl compounds in gastric mucosa. These sulfhydryls may be necessary for stabilization of cell membranes as well as for binding free radicals. Ethanol is damaging to the mucosal microcirculation. The rapidity of ethanol-induced damage makes it unlikely that the process is purely ischemic. The cytoprotective phenomenon, as this brief literature review suggests, is a multifactorial, dynamic process. The complex interplay of mucosal defense factors, endogenous and exogenous stimuli, induction of humoral responses, and ultimately the success or failure of cellular repair, is unlikely to be solely mediated by endogenous prostaglandins. Although prostaglandins are unquestionably significant to cytoprotection, the supporting and, perhaps, major roles of leukotrienes, sulfhydryls, histamines, and like substances cannot be ignored. Several innovative therapeutic agents directly derived from these research efforts have already entered the clinician's formulary. The significance of the concept of cytoprotection is only now being realized in clinical applications. Alcoholic hemorrhagic gastritis, although a significant clinical entity, remains a rather elusive diagnosis for the emergency physician. As a diagnosis of suspicion, therapeutic trials of antacids, sucralfate, or perhaps synthetic prostaglandin analogues are acceptable, pending endoscopic verification or short-term resolution of symptoms. All patients presenting with true hemorrhage or with persistent symptoms should undergo gastroenterologic referral and endoscopic evaluation. The Mallory-Weiss syndrome has long been associated with acute and chronic alcohol abuse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although still poorly understood, the mechanism of this injury is probably the result of numerous direct toxic and metabolic effects of alcohol on the hepatocyte. Therapy consists primarily of abstinence and supportive care. However, several newer treatments are actively being studied. These include prednisolone, anabolic steroids, glucagon and insulin, propylthiouracil, and cyanidanol. Colchicine is promising as an agent to inhibit fibrosis. Complications of cirrhosis, including ascites and variceal hemorrhage, are the result of end stage disease. A return to old techniques of ascitic fluid management suggests that therapeutic large-volume paracentesis with albumin infusion is a safe and effective form of therapy. Variceal hemorrhage is best treated with sclerotherapy, vasoconstrictors, and balloon tamponade. Little has been done to alter the ultimately dismal prognosis and long-term survival of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Physicians can intervene in the alcohol-trauma cycle. Unfortunately, they are notably poor in detecting the patient with alcohol-related injury. Moreover, physicians infrequently refer these patients to facilities and personnel that are expert in alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation. Recidivism can be positively impacted by physicians who are sensitive to and versed in the medical and social patterns of alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".U": "91031227\r", 
  ".W": "The sources of cholesterol for testosterone production were investigated in freshly isolated murine Leydig cells. In vitro stimulation with human CG (hCG) (0.2 IU/ml) caused a 75-fold increase in testosterone production. Leydig cells contained approximately equal amounts of free and esterified cholesterol (7.8 vs. 8.7 micrograms/mg protein). The total cholesterol content of cells stimulated for 4 h with hCG was significantly decreased compared with unstimulated cells (8.4 vs. 17.6 micrograms/mg protein); both free and esterified cholesterol decreased by about 50%. In unstimulated Leydig cells incubated with [14C]acetate for 12 h, the majority of incorporated [14C] was found in free and esterified cholesterol, whereas, in the hCG-stimulated cells, 80% of incorporated 14C was in testosterone. The activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase after 4 h in hCG-stimulated cells was 20% higher than in unstimulated cells (115.5 vs. 84.4 pmol/mg protein.min). However, by 6 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity doubled in the hCG-stimulated compared with unstimulated cells. By 12 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity in hCG-stimulated cells was 4 times the preincubation level and 8 times the 12-h level in unstimulated cells. HMG-CoA reductase activity induced by hCG was blocked by aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, had no effect on unstimulated or hCG-stimulated testosterone production during a 12-h incubation. Murine high density lipoproteins (mHDL) increased HMG-CoA reductase activity in both unstimulated (29%) and hCG-stimulated (20%) cells. During a 6 h incubation, mHDL increased hCG-stimulated testosterone production by 20%, but had no effect on unstimulated testosterone production. These results suggest that murine Leydig cells store enough cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to support testosterone production for at least 12 h in vitro. Although mHDL does not have a major stimulatory effect on testosterone biosynthesis, it may be involved in the regulation of de novo cholesterol synthesis.\r"

In this study the sulfate-containing complex carbohydrates were characterized by the number of sulfate and sialic acid residues that they contain. Samples of normal and nodular thyroid tissue were incubated for 16 h in [35S]sulfate-containing medium, and hTG was purified from the tissues and the media. Complex carbohydrates were enzymatically removed from hTG. Subsequent analysis on an HPLC anion exchange column at pH 2.2 separated the carbohydrate units according to their number of negative charges. Sulfate-containing peaks were monitored by radioactivity, and sialic acid-containing peaks were identified by their shift to lower charge after treatment with neuraminidase. Peaks corresponding to sialic acid-free carbohydrate units with one to four sulfates were identified. Also, carbohydrate units with two and three negative charges containing both sulfate and sialic acid were present. In the nodular tissue of one patient there were more sulfated units with higher charge, especially units containing sialic acid. In this patient the proportion of sulfated polyvalent units with sialic acid was 22.4% for normal and 64.6% for nodular tissue. No difference in the composition of the charged units between the tissues and their corresponding media was seen, making it unlikely that the sulfate-containing carbohydrates play a role in hTG release. It is concluded that hTG contains complex carbohydrate units with up to four sulfate groups and units with both sulfate and sialic acid. In some patients, the sulfate-containing anionic carbohydrate units of hTG from normal and nodular thyroid tissue are different.\r"

  ".W": "The placenta is the primary source of estrogens and progesterone during pregnancy. Because pregnant diabetic women are reported to have lower serum estrogen and higher progesterone levels than nondiabetic pregnant women, and placental insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) production may be elevated during diabetic pregnancy, the role of IGF-II in the regulation of human cytotrophoblastic aromatase, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD), and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme activities was studied. Incubation of cytotrophoblasts with IGF-II for 24 h significantly diminished the ability of these cells to convert androstenedione to estrogens by 92.3 +/- 6.6 (SE)%. IGF-II could suppress aromatase activity at a concentration as low as 2.0 ng/ml. Preincubation of cells with either insulin, IGF-I, or a monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody did not alter IGF-II's potent inhibitory effect. Treatment with mannose 6-phosphate alone also resulted in significant suppression of aromatase activity, and concurrent treatment with both mannose 6-phosphate and IGF-II resulted in greater inhibition than with either agent alone. These observations suggest that IGF-II suppresses aromatase activity by activation of its own specific receptor. In contrast, incubation of cytotrophoblasts with IGF-II for 24 h significantly increased the 3 beta HSD activity (as determined by the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone) and P450scc activity (as determined by the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol to progesterone) of these cells. IGF-II's ability to stimulate these enzymatic processes was found to be comparable in magnitude to that of IGF-I. IGF-II-stimulated 3 beta HSD activity was completely inhibited by concurrent treatment with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, suggesting that new mRNA and protein synthesis are required for IGF-II to exert its stimulatory effect. These studies indicate that IGF-II is a potent inhibitor of human cytotrophoblastic aromatase activity in vitro. In addition, IGF-II can stimulate cytotrophoblastic 3 beta HSD and P450scc activities. Since placental IGF-II production in pregnant diabetic women may be augmented, these observations may help explain the lower serum estrogen and higher progesterone levels associated with pregnancy in the diabetic patient.\r"

  ".W": "Ovine adrenal fasciculata cells (OAC) responded to ACTH but were resistant to the steroidogenic action of angiotensin-II (A-II), while bovine adrenal fasciculata cells (BAC) responded to this hormone as well as to ACTH. However both cell types contained specific A-II binding sites (120,000 +/- 14,000 and 85,000 +/- 10,000 sites per cell for OAC and BAC, respectively) of similar high affinity [dissociation constant (KD) congruent to 2 x 10(-9) M]. Moreover, in both cell types, A-II receptors were coupled to intracellular effectors since A-II: 1) stimulated the accumulation of inositol phosphates, although the effects in BAC were higher than in OAC; 2) enhanced the influx and the efflux of 45Ca2+; 3) increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i); 4) potentiated ACTH-induced cAMP production; and 5) induced A-II receptor loss. Both cell types appear to have an active protein kinase C since the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate potentiates ACTH-induced cAMP production and caused A-II receptor loss. In addition, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate and Ca2+ ionophore enhanced the steroid production by BAC but had no effect on OAC. These results indicated that the steroidogenic refractoriness of OAC to A-II might involve some step(s) beyond the initial activation of the two branches of the phosphoinositide pathway, activation of protein kinase C and increase of [Ca2+]i, and before conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that the suckling stimulus sensitizes or primes the anterior pituitary to PRL-releasing stimuli. It is also recognized that PRL-secreting cells from a given animal are not all alike but instead exhibit a considerable degree of functional heterogeneity. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the suckling-induced priming phenomenon is manifest at the cellular level by shifts in the relative abundance of various mammotrope subpopulations. This was accomplished by using reverse hemolytic plaque assays to evaluate the secretory characteristics of individual PRL secretors derived from lactating rats either before or after the transient application of a suckling stimulus. Groups of day 10 lactating rats separated from their litters for 4 h were either killed immediately or were reunited briefly (10 min) with their pups before death. Adenohypophyseal cells obtained after trypsin dispersion were then subjected to plaque assays for PRL. Mammotropes derived from suckled rats were, on average, considerably more responsive to the stimulatory actions of TRH and angiotensin II and less susceptible to inhibition by dopamine. Mammotropes from nonsuckled rats exhibited a bimodal frequency distribution in which plaques from the second mode were roughly 6-8 times larger (released considerably more PRL) than those from the first. Superimposition of suckling (or in vitro treatment with dopamine) caused the second mode to disappear. Suckling also enhanced greatly the fraction of PRL cells that shifted from the first to the second mode (i.e. released more hormone) after treatment with TRH or angiotensin II. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the suckling-induced sensitization of pituitary tissue to PRL-releasing stimuli is manifest at the cellular level as proportional shifts toward those cells most responsive to stimulatory secretagogues and away from those most susceptible to inhibition by dopamine.\r"

  ".W": "In the sheep, in contrast to the rat, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a more potent stimulus to ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary (AP) than CRF. To further explore this difference, we have compared [3H]AVP and [125I]-[Nle21 Tyr32]ovine CRF binding in membranes prepared from rat and sheep AP. Between species, no difference in affinity of binding was found for either ligand. In contrast, the concentration of AVP receptors in sheep AP was twice that in rat, whereas that of CRF receptors was only one tenth. AVP receptor concentration in sheep AP was not altered by chronic (10 day) dexamethasone administration, but fell to 60% of control after chronic (60 day) hypothalamo-pituitary-disconnection. The increased level of AVP receptors and the much lower level of CRF receptors in sheep compared with rat may thus provide an explanation for our previous findings of increased sensitivity to AVP and a very poor response to CRF in stimulating ACTH release from the sheep AP. In addition the finding that AVP receptor numbers are reduced in the hypothalamo-pituitary-disconnected sheep suggests that hypothalamic factors may play a role in regulating AVP receptor concentration in the ovine AP gland.\r"

They were chromatographed on an immunomatrix of Affi-Gel 10-D1E8 anti beta-hCG monoclonal antibody (this antibody has been shown not to interfere with hCG binding to receptor). Elution was performed at alkaline pH, a condition in which hCG-receptor complexes are relatively stable. Immunization of a mouse with these partially (approximately 15%) purified hormone-receptor complexes allowed the preparation of 20 different hybridomas, each secreting antireceptor antibodies. The latter were used for receptor characterization. Immunoblot of testicular membrane extracts or of purified receptor preparations showed the presence of a major band at approximately 85,000 mol wt and minor bands at approximately 68,000 mol wt and approximately 48-45,000 mol wt. The width of all these bands suggested some microheterogeneity possibly due to glycosylation. The same approximately 85,000 mol wt receptor was seen in ovarian membranes, but no detectable antigen was observed in liver, muscle, and kidney membranes. An immunoaffinity method (using antibody LHR 38) was devised to purify the receptor in a single step. This demonstrated that the purified receptor preparation did not contain any protein component other than those detected by immunoblot. Comparison of receptors purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using either antireceptor or antihormone monoclonal antibodies showed in both cases the presence of the 85,000 mol wt and 48-45,000 mol wt species, but the absence, in the latter case, of the 68,000 mol wt species. This suggests that the 68,000 mol wt receptor cannot bind hormone and does not form oligomers with other receptor species.\r"

  ".W": "The transmembrane signaling events of GH were investigated in the liver, a major target organ of GH action. Recombinant human GH when added to freshly isolated rat hepatocytes rapidly stimulated the production of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). The generation of DAG was biphasic with the first transient peak observed at 2 min and the second peak at 15 min (1.2-fold and 1.4-fold over control, respectively). Levels of DAG continued to be elevated above those in control cells at 30 min. The response was dose-dependent with an EC50 of 0.15 nM. Both bovine GH and rat GH, which bind to the rat GH receptor but not to the PRL receptor, also stimulated DAG production. Similarly, human PRL, which binds to the PRL but not GH receptor, stimulated DAG formation to a comparable extent. These results suggest that production of DAG may be an early signaling event mediated by hormone stimulation of both the GH and PRL receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91031235\r", 
  ".W": "Five methods are commonly used to quantify FRTL-5 cells' and other thyrocytes' growth in vitro and the impact of growth inhibiting or stimulating maneuvers: Total cell count, mitotic index, DNA measurement, total [3H]thymidine incorporation, and the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells. All of them assess cell growth as though all cells were homogeneous with an identical response to growth factors. We demonstrate here that this assumption is not valid. Rather, some intrinsically growth-prone cells appear to pass a growth signal to neighboring cells so that variably sized colonies of synchronized cells within each cluster growing from monodispersed cells are formed. This is true for FRTL-5 cells growing in vitro in monolayers and in three-dimensional, collagen embedded spheroids. The pattern is the same when cell suspensions or collagen-embedded spheroids are implanted onto nude mice. Patches with alternating high and low growth become particularly prominent in the large tumor-like organoids grown from monodispersed cells in nude mice. The pattern much reminds of similar observations in growing intact thyroids. Since there is no significant correlation between the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells and the size of two- or three-dimensional clusters in any experiment, growth of signal-spreading cells is assumed to occur in leaps and bounds. Growth velocity in each subclone of a cell population depends on the mean interval between bursts of replications and on the number of cells synchronized by cell-to-cell diffusion of the growth signal emanating from one dividing cell. Thus, growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors may not only act on the mean interval between successive growth bursts, but they may also change cell-to-cell spreading of growth signals.\r"

  ".W": "Food deprivation in the rat is associated with a reduction in serum GH levels characterized by suppression of high amplitude GH bursts and a decrease in the duration of secretory episodes. The mechanism(s) mediating this response is unknown. The present studies were designed to evaluate the role of hypothalamic factors potentially responsible for abnormal GH dynamics in food-deprived rats by measuring hypothalamic prepro-GH-releasing factor (GRF) and preprosomatostatin (SRIF) mRNA and peptide levels in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after 72 h of food deprivation or free access to food. Hypothalamic prepro-GRF mRNA was reduced 80% in food-deprived rats compared to that in fed controls (P less than 0.001), while GRF content was unchanged. Levels of prepro-SRIF mRNA in food-deprived rats were similar to those in controls, as was hypothalamic SRIF content. The time course of hypothalamic prepro-GRF mRNA reduction was determined in groups of rats food-deprived for 24, 48, or 72 h and revealed a significant (30%) reduction of prepro-GRF mRNA (P less than 0.05 vs. fed) by 24 h, with maximal reduction (80%) by 48 h. Refeeding groups of animals for up to 72 h after they had been food-deprived for 72 h resulted in restoration of prepro-GRF mRNA levels to 50% of control levels by 24 h (P less than 0.05 vs. fed) and a return to control values by 48 h. These data suggest that decreased GRF gene expression and possibly GRF release play a major role in the loss of pulsatile GH secretion seen in this model of nutrient deprivation.\r"

To understand the role of PS beta G in placental ontogeny during pregnancy, we examined its synthesis and regulation in primary cultures of trophoblast cells. Freshly plated (12 h) cytotrophoblasts expressed little PS beta G transcripts; however, within 24 h of culture, PS beta G mRNAs became detectable. PS beta G synthesis and mRNA expression increased with time in culture, and maximal synthesis was achieved at 4 days, indicating that primary trophoblasts continue differentiating in vitro. Molecular cloning revealed that PS beta G is an extremely polymorphic protein. Most PS beta G cDNAs identified to date, including the three cDNAs (PSG16, PSG93, and PSG95) isolated in this laboratory, share strong sequence similarity in the 5' (designated PSG-5') and coding regions, but differ in sequences at the 3' region. The PSG-5', PSG93-specific, PSG16/PSG93-3', and PSG95-3' probes, which identify the majority of PS beta G mRNAs, hybridized with three mRNAs of 2.3, 2.2, and 1.7 kilobases in primary trophoblasts and human term placental tissue. Ribonuclease protection analysis demonstrated that primary trophoblasts expressed most of the placental PS beta G transcripts. However, culturing in vitro altered PS beta G gene expression, and the level of PS beta G transcripts containing a PSG95-3' sequence was preferentially increased in primary trophoblasts. Moreover, primary trophoblasts synthesized a 64K PS beta G polypeptide in variable amounts and three PS beta Gs of 72K, 62K, and 54K in roughly equal amounts, whereas purified human term placental PS beta G consists of a major polypeptide of 72K and two minor ones of 64K and 54K. PS beta G gene expression in primary trophoblasts was slightly reduced by 8-bromo-cAMP, but was markedly inhibited by sodium butyrate.\r"

  ".W": "Based on previous findings that epidermal growth factor (EGF), which plays an important role in maintenance of spermatogenesis, is deficient in diabetic mice, the significance of EGF deficiency in the pathogenesis of oligozoospermia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice was studied. EGF levels in the submandibular glands and plasma of diabetic mice were 0.61 +/- 0.07 micrograms/mg tissue and 0.25 +/- 0.02 ng/ml (mean +/- SE), respectively, whereas those of normal mice were 1.63 +/- 0.08 micrograms/mg tissue and 0.54 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, respectively. The epididymal sperm counts of diabetic mice, 4.7 +/- 0.14 x 10(5)/mg tissue, were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those of normal mice, 6.0 +/- 0.10 x 10(5)/mg tissue. Administration of EGF (5 micrograms/mouse/day) to diabetic mice significantly (P less than 0.01) increased their sperm counts to 5.5 +/- 0.16 x 10(5)/mg tissue without affecting plasma levels of testosterone and glucose. Furthermore, insulin treatment (1 U/mouse/day) of diabetic mice restored the submandibular gland, plasma EGF concentrations, and sperm counts to normal levels. The restorative effects of insulin on sperm production appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by EGF, because its effect was significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced by the concomitant administration of EGF antiserum. In addition, the plasma testosterone levels of diabetic mice, 67 +/- 14.3 ng/ml, were lower that those of normal mice, 122 +/- 19.1 ng/ml. Administration of testosterone (1 mg/mouse/day) normalized the submandibular gland and plasma EGF levels and significantly increased sperm counts in the epididymis. These results suggest that EGF deficiency is a possible cause for the pathogenesis of oligozoospermia in diabetic mice.\r"

The content of 3 beta-HSD protein was measured by immunoblot analysis using an antiserum developed in rabbits against human 3 beta-HSD, whereas 3 beta-HSD activity was measured using [3H]pregnenolone, [3H] dehydroepiandrosterone, and [3H]androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-diol as substrates. There was a parallel increase in 3 beta-HSD mRNA, protein content, and enzymatic activity levels from days 1-3 after estrus to maximal values at 50-100% above control on days 8-11 after estrus. Thereafter, all values decreased progressively until days 16-17 before a dramatic fall to 5% or less than maximal values on days 18-20 after estrus. Almost superimposable results of enzymatic activity were obtained with the three substrates, thus suggesting a unique 3 beta-HSD or parallel changes in the activity of multiple 3 beta-HSDs. The above-described changes observed during the luteal phase are almost exclusively due to variations in corpora lutea. In fact, 3 beta-HSD activity in ovarian follicles was approximately 10,000 lower than that measured in corpora lutea. The close correlation observed over a wide range of 3 beta-HSD mRNA, protein content, and activity levels suggests that changes of ovarian 3 beta-HSD activity are controlled at the level of 3 beta-HSD gene expression and/or 3 beta-HSD mRNA stability.\r"

We have described the distribution of GRF immunoreactivity (GRF-IR) in various tissues and characterized its molecular heterogeneity using gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and two separate RIAs that recognized mid-molecule and carboxyl-terminal epitopes of hGRF. The highest levels of GRF-IR were in the pituitary, followed by the pancreas. Intermediate levels were present in hypothalamus and liver, and lower levels in visceral organs, heart, and gonads. The pituitary and brain revealed evidence of the two mature hormone forms [hGRF(1-44)-NH2 and hGRF(1-40)-OH and in addition a more hydrophobic form that is believed to represent the hGRF precursor (proGRF) on the basis of its estimated molecular size (approximately 9,000) and selective recognition by the mid-molecule RIA. The profiles of GRF in pancreas and gut were similar except that only minimal amounts of hGRF(1-40)-OH were detected. In contrast, neither mature hormonal form was present in the liver and plasma contained primarily hGRF(3-44)-NH2, the major circulating metabolite of hGRF. The results provide evidence for variable processing of the hGRF precursor that is tissue specific and indicate that several extrahypothalamic tissues possess the necessary complement of enzymes to generate the mature hormonal forms.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we have described a serum free culture method for culturing bovine theca cells in vitro. These cultured cells could be stimulated with LH to produce renin and prorenin. Though intracellular prorenin as well as renin was increased by LH, no renin was found to be released into the extracellular medium. The extracellular medium contained prorenin exclusively. The stimulatory effect of LH could be mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) and forskolin, suggesting cAMP to be the second messenger involved. Induction of renin and prorenin production by LH in cultured theca cells was dependent upon de novo protein synthesis, since the action of LH could be completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The stimulatory effects of LH, 8-Br-cAMP, or forskolin were also blocked by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), via putative activation of protein kinase C. However, to completely block the stimulatory effect of LH or 8-Br-cAMP, it was necessary to add PMA either before LH/8-Br-cAMP was added or simultaneously with the agonists. With progressive delay in addition of PMA after LH/8-Br-cAMP was added, the extent of inhibition decreased gradually and if PMA was added anytime after 4 h of LH/8-Br-cAMP addition, no inhibitory effect could be observed. Thus we have shown that renin/prorenin production by theca cells in vitro can be directly regulated by LH in a cAMP-dependent manner. Prorenin is preferentially released from the cells. Activation of protein kinase C appears to inhibit some very early steps in the induction of prorenin/renin production which however is distal to cAMP formation.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were undertaken to define potential regulation of endometrial insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis and secretion by steroid hormones and to correlate conceptus- and serum-derived estrogens with these events. Four experimental groups of gilts were studied: 1) prepubertal gilts administered estradiol (E) and/or progesterone (P4) daily for up to 15 days; 2) mature gilts ovariectomized (ovx) on day 2 of the estrous cycle, and then administered E, P4, or E plus P4 from days 4-11 after estrus; 3) unilaterally pregnant gilts on day 12 or 16 after the onset of estrus; and 4) cyclic gilts administered E on day 11 and hysterectomized 1, 6, 12, or 24 h after E. IGF-I mRNA was measured by blot hybridization of total cellular RNAs, while a specific RIA was used to quantitate levels of tissue and uterine luminal fluid (ULF) IGF-I. In prepubertal gilts, E or P4 increased uterine IGF-I mRNA levels and IGF-I protein. Mature, ovx gilts treated with E, P4, or E plus P4 had increased levels of endometrial IGF-I mRNAs and protein and luminal IGF-I. The magnitude of E or P4 induction was comparable and was not additive. Gravid horns on day 12 had higher amounts of IGF-I in ULF compared to day 12 nongravid horns or day 16 gravid and nongravid horns. However, no significant differences in the amounts of endometrial IGF-I mRNA and tissue IGF-I content between horns on each day were detected. Acute treatment of cyclic gilts (day 11) with E increased levels of endometrial IGF-I mRNAs and luminal IGF-I 1 h after treatment. The effect of E was transient and was reversed within 24 h of E injection. IGF-II and IGF-binding protein-2 mRNAs were regulated by E and P4 distinct from IGF-I mRNAs. These results indicate that E and P4 are involved in the normal regulation of uterine IGF-I synthesis and/or secretion. However, the relative contributions of serum and conceptus-derived estrogens in these processes during the preimplantation period in the pig remain to be defined.\r"

  ".U": "91031245\r", 
  ".W": "Previously it has been shown that progesterone, as well as estrogen, plays an important role in the growth of the mammary gland. Eighty percent of mammary progesterone receptors (PgR) are estrogen-inducible and are localized in the epithelium; the remaining 20% of PgR are estrogen-independent and appear to be localized in the mammary stroma. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how progestins promote mammary growth in relation to their interactions with epithelial and stromal components of the gland and to assess the role of estrogen in these interactions. Progestins [progesterone, [17 beta-methyl-3H]promogestone (R5020), and medroxy progesterone acetate] alone or in combination with estrogen were combined with Elvax 40P and implanted directly into mammary glands. The effect of hormones on cell proliferation was determined by observing changes in mammary gland morphology and by quantitating DNA synthesis in both epithelial and stromal cells by DNA histoautoradiography. The results demonstrate that in mammary epithelial cells the effects of progestins on mammary gland morphology and DNA synthesis are locally mediated such that proliferative changes in the hormone-implanted glands were greater than in contralateral control glands. Dose-response studies with estrogen and R5020 revealed that the extent of progestin activity was only partially dependent upon the R5020 dose with the major determining factor being the dose of estrogen. Analysis of the effect of estrogen on mammary PgR concentration indicates that the degree and pattern of the morphological response of ductal sidebranching and increases in DNA synthesis are largely due to the increase in estrogen-dependent PgR. The antiprogestin, 11 beta-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)1-17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-(prop-1ynyl)-estra-4,9-diene-3-one (RU486), blocks the proliferation in the epithelium that is mediated through estrogen-dependent PgR. In contrast, in stromal cells progestin activity is not estrogen-dependent, and stimulation of DNA synthesis was not confined to the hormone-implanted glands. Furthermore, RU486 stimulates stromal cell DNA synthesis, and this response is augmented by estrogen. While progestin effects in epithelial cells appear to be mediated by estrogen-dependent PgR, the mechanism operative in stromal cells appears to be different and remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "Immunosympathectomy produced by treatment of newborn rats with antibodies to nerve growth factor (NGF) delays ovarian development and disrupts estrous cyclicity. While these alterations have been ascribed to loss of sympathetic neurons innervating the ovary, the treatment also causes partial loss of ovarian sensory innervation. The present experiments were undertaken to determine if selective interference with ovarian noradrenergic/sympathetic action would result in alterations of ovarian development similar to those caused by NGF antibodies (NGF Ab). We have used two approaches to disrupt catecholamine action on ovarian cells: 1) inhibition of beta-adrenoreceptors by local delivery of receptor blockers to the ovaries of juvenile rats; and 2) elimination of the sympathetic innervation by long term postnatal treatment with guanethidine (GD), an adrenergic neuron blocking agent. When GD is administered chronically it produces an autoimmune-mediated destruction of peripheral sympathetic nerves, without affecting cholinergic or sensory neurons. Of the receptor blockers tested, FM-24, a nonreversible antagonist, resulted in a sustained 70% decrease in available receptors throughout the 10-day period studied. In spite of this, the timing of puberty, assessed by the age at vaginal opening and first ovulation, was not delayed, suggesting that activation of the remaining receptors by an intact innervation suffices to maintain a normal noradrenergic influence. GD treatment initiated at the end of the first week of postnatal life and maintained for three weeks slowed the juvenile-peripubertal rate of body growth, delayed the time of vaginal opening and first ovulation, and disrupted subsequent estrous cyclicity, but did not affect the animals' fertility. The ovaries of GD-treated rats exhibited a striking loss of sympathetic (norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y) nerves but a normal sensory innervation (represented by fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide). The concentration of beta-adrenoreceptors in granulosa cells was reduced, suggesting follicular immaturity. Direct assessment of this inference by morphometric analysis of the ovaries revealed that follicular development was retarded. The progesterone and estrogen response of juvenile ovaries to gonadotropins in vitro were also reduced. At this time, circulating LH levels were slightly decreased, but neither LHRH content in the median eminence nor the LHRH response to prostaglandin E2 in vitro were affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

IGF-II receptor levels were determined in liver plasma membrane and Golgi/endosome fractions from sham-operated and hepatectomized rats by ligand binding and immunoblotting after electrophoresis. After hepatectomy, IGF-II receptors increased initially in the plasma membrane (within 24 h of surgery) to 4-fold control levels, remained elevated for 72 h, and declined to control levels at 120 h when liver regeneration is near complete. However, Golgi/endosome levels of IGF-II receptors did not increase until 48 h, showing a maximum increase of 3.5-fold at 72 h after surgery and returning to control values at 120 h. The 9-kilobase mRNA for IGF-II receptor, determined by slot blotting with a complementary DNA probe, increased 2.5-fold within 24 h of surgery, attaining a maximum stimulation of 4-fold at 48 h, and then decreasing to normal levels by 120 h. These changes show that, after partial hepatectomy, IGF-II receptors increase rapidly at the cell surface, possibly due to receptor translocation from intracellular pools. This is followed by an increase of IGF-II receptor mRNA and increased receptor synthesis, resulting in an increase in total cellular receptors. These results suggest a role for IGF-II receptors in regenerating liver, perhaps in cell proliferation and/or in tissue remodeling.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of glucagon gene expression and the posttranslational processing of proglucagon was studied in the fetal and neonatal rat. Pancreatic immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) and glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) were low in both fetal pancreas and intestine, respectively. Immediately after birth, pancreatic IRG rose markedly and reached a peak concentration at postnatal day 7, followed by a gradual return to its adult level. Intestinal GLI was low until postnatal day 7 and rose steadily thereafter to adult levels. The levels of GLI in the hypothalamus were much lower than in intestine, yet the developmental accumulation of hypothalamic GLI resembled the pattern observed in intestine. In contrast, the levels of GLI and IRG in the brain stem were higher in the fetus and neonate, and decreased to adult levels. Proglucagon mRNA transcripts, uniform in size, were detected in RNA isolated from fetal or adult brainstem, pancreas, and intestine. However, fetal proglucagon mRNA transcripts were larger than adult proglucagon mRNA transcripts in pancreas and intestine, but not brainstem. The results of RNAse mapping studies, including analysis of both the 5'- and 3'-ends of the mRNA transcripts, demonstrated that the larger fetal mRNA transcripts could be accounted for by an increase in the length of the polyadenylate tail in the fetal tissues. These observations demonstrate that the developing rat exhibits tissue-specific differences in both proglucagon gene expression and the pattern of posttranslational processing of the prohormone.\r"

  ".W": "Glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity has been shown to change in liver membranes manipulated to alter either their fatty acid composition or fluidity. We examined whether membrane alterations induced by dietary manipulation affected receptor function. Glucagon- and beta-adrenergic-stimulated receptor-adenylyl cyclase systems were examined in liver membranes of rats fed diets containing 10% corn oil, 10% coconut oil (essential FFA deficient), or 8.5% coconut oil with 1.5% corn oil (essential FFA repleat). Basal and maximal nonreceptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity (stimulated by NaF, guanylylimidodiphosphate, and forskolin) was the same in membranes of each of the dietary groups, suggesting that Gs-protein and the catalytic unit activity per se were unaltered by the manipulations. Glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity increased with increasing unsaturation of dietary fatty acids; activity in coconut oil-fed rats was 527 +/- 30 (mean +/- SEM) pmol/mg.10 min, that in coconut/corn oil-fed rats was 752 +/- 74 pmol/mg.10 min, and that in corn oil-fed rats was 981 +/- 94 pmol cAMP/mg.10 min. [125I]Monoiodoglucagon binding did not increase in parallel to the adenylyl cyclase alterations; coconut oil-fed animals (614 fmol/mg) differed from the other groups (450 and 430 fmol/mg). Isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was also highest in the corn oil-fed animals, but was similar in the other dietary groups, with no difference in other characteristics of [125I]iodopindolol binding between the groups. The results demonstrate that alterations in the glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase response are different from those in the beta-adrenergic adenylyl cyclase response. Further, they suggest that although direct activations of the catalytic unit or its interaction with the guanine nucleotide-sensitive protein are apparently not affected, hormone receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity may be altered by these dietary manipulations.\r"

  ".W": "By photoaffinity labeling human low density lipoproteins (LDL) with [125I]T4 we confirmed our previous observation that of the three T4 binding sites of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) one is in its 26% NH2-terminal portion [apoB-26, the 140 kDa fragment, residues 1-1297] and two in the remaining 74% COOH portion (apoB-74, 410 kDa, residues 1298-4536). We now show that of these two sites one is in the NH2 portion of apoB-74 (apoB-44, 240 kDa, residues 1298-3249) and the other in the nonoverlapping COOH portion (apoB-30, 170 kDa, residues 3250-4536). ApoB-100 contains 13 binding sites for heparin, a known inhibitor of T4 binding to the major T4 carrier plasma proteins; however, heparin failed to inhibit T4 binding to apoB-100 and fragments thereof. The same failure was seen with three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 4G3, 5E11, and 43 that block totally or partially LDL binding to the LDL receptor [respective epitopes at residues 2980-3084 (apoB-44), 3441-3569, and 4027-4081 (apoB-30)]. Of the other 3 MAbs, all without effect on LDL binding to the LDL receptor, [1D1, 2D8, and 16, respective epitopes at residues 474-539 (apoB-26), 1438-1481 (apoB-44), and 4154-4189 (apoB-30)], only two (MAbs 1D1 and 2D8) inhibited T4 binding (21 to 39%). We conclude that the three T4-binding sites of apoB-100 are outside the LDL receptor binding domain, distant from the heparin binding sites and, assuming no allosteric effects, in the vicinity of residues 474-539 (T4 site of apoB-26), 1438-1481 (T4 site of apoB-44), and in the C terminal quarter of apoB-30.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have demonstrated that intestinal triglyceride production and secretion are increased in diabetic animals and may contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia that accompanies diabetes. There are three potential sources of fatty acids for intestinally derived triglycerides; de novo fatty acid synthesis, circulating free fatty acids, or dietarily derived fatty acids. Prior data have demonstrated that de novo cholesterol synthesis is increased in the small intestine of diabetic animals. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the effect of diabetes on small intestinal de novo fatty acid synthesis. We found that de novo fatty acid synthesis in the small intestine is increased approximately 2-fold in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In contrast, hepatic fatty acid synthesis is decreased in the diabetic animals. The increase in intestinal fatty acid synthesis is observed in both the fed and fasting states. Limiting food intake by pair feeding prevents the diabetic-induced increase in small intestinal fatty acid synthesis, a finding similar to previous data on cholesterol synthesis. Thus, the increase in both small intestinal cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis is dependent on the increased food intake that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. The present study indicates that increases in small intestinal de novo fatty acid synthesis in diabetic animals could play an important role in providing fatty acids for increased small intestinal triglyceride synthesis and secretion.\r"

  ".W": "1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) rapidly affects calcium (Ca2+) transport in several cell systems, suggesting physiological actions independent of genomic activation. To test this hypothesis, we studied immediate to early effects (0.5-300 sec) of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cytosolic Ca2+ [Ca2+]i in single osteogenic sarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells loaded with fura-2. An acute rise in [Ca2+]i was observed in 40% of the cells following addition of 1,25(OH)2D3, with a threshold concentration of 10(-11) M. In most cases, the [Ca2+]i rise was transient, with return to baseline within 1 min; less frequently a more prolonged effect was observed, with variable recovery times. 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) reproduced the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on [Ca2+]i, with equal potency and similar responses, whereas 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, and 22 oxa-1,25(OH)2D3 were not effective. 1,25(OH)2D3 also increased [Ca2+]i in ROS 24/1 cells, which are defective of receptors for the vitamin D metabolites. At high doses (10(-8)-10(-7) M) of 1,25(OH)2D3 the [Ca2+]i rise in ROS 17/2.8 cells was due to both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, as the effect was only partially inhibited by Ca2(+)-channel blockade by nifedipine. At low doses (10(-9)-10(-10) M), the effect was entirely dependent on extracellular Ca2+. 1,25(OH)2D3 also increased the production of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (Ins(1, 4, 5)P3) and diacylglycerol, at a threshold dose of 10(-9) M, indicating activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In two thirds of the cells studied, a second addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 within 5 min to cells prestimulated with equimolar doses of the vitamin D metabolite resulted in a [Ca2+]i transient of higher amplitude than the first, a phenomenon occurring at all doses of the hormone, and associated with production of Ins(1, 4, 5)P3. This response amplification was not produced by 25(OH)D3, and pretreatment with 1 alpha(OH)D3 did not significantly enhance 1,25(OH)2D3-induced production of Ins(1, 4, 5)P3. In conclusion, activation of the Ca2+ message system by vitamin D metabolites is a rapid, nongenomic effect; 1,25(OH)2D3 specifically activates both PLC and dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, and \"primes\" the cells to respond with an enhanced [Ca2+]i rise to a subsequent homologous stimulation; the presence of both the 1 alpha and 25 hydroxyl groups is necessary to express the full hormonal action of vitamin D on [Ca2+]i.\r"

T4 treatment on days 0-6 augmented both the in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical signals in kidney but not in SMG on day 7. By contrast, T4 injections on days 7-14 did not alter the in situ hybridization or immunocytochemical signals in kidney but increased both signals in SMG on day 15. Thus, neonatal T4 treatment augments the levels of EGF mRNA as well as EGF immunoreactivity in both kidney and SMG. The T4 effect is manifested during the first week in kidney whereas the SMG responds to T4 treatment only during the second week of life.\r"

Since GAL coexists with vasopressin and CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), we have studied the pharmacological and physiological actions of GAL on ACTH and TSH secretion in freely moving male rats. Cannulae were surgically implanted in the right atria and brain, intraventricular or adjacent to the PVN, of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Seven days later, GAL (500 or 1000 ng) or saline was infused into the PVN, and serial blood samples were obtained 5, 10, 20, and 40 min after the infusion. Some animals were also stressed by the inhalation of ether vapors for 2 min after the PVN infusion. Basal ACTH concentrations were increased 2-fold in saline-treated rats; however, plasma ACTH levels were unchanged after GAL infusion. The exposure of rats to ether vapors for 2 min after the infusion of saline into the PVN increased plasma ACTH concentrations from 22.8 +/- 6.0 to 596.6 +/- 59.9 pg/ml 10 min later. However, the infusion of GAL into the PVN attenuated stress-induced ACTH secretion. After GAL infusion, peak ACTH levels (332.7 +/- 84.0 pg/ml) were attained 5 min after ether exposure, followed by a rapid decline at 10 min (P less than 0.001) and 20 min (P less than 0.05). Plasma TSH concentrations were unchanged by GAL or saline infusion and were not affected by ether vapor inhalation. To determine the physiological significance of GAL in the control of ACTH and TSH secretion, endogenous GAL was immunoneutralized by the infusion of 3 microliters GAL antiserum (GAL-AS) into the third cerebral ventricle 25 and 1 h before withdrawing blood samples every 15 min for 6 h. Animals treated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) served as controls. Plasma ACTH concentrations were unchanged by NRS during the 6-h period. However, infusion of GAL-AS raised plasma ACTH concentrations to over 400 pg/ml 75 min after infusion in some animals. In general, plasma ACTH concentrations were increased 4 h of the 6-h sampling period compared to levels in NRS-treated controls. In contrast, GAL-AS reduced TSH concentrations by 50% compared to control values. In contrast to these marked actions of centrally administered GAL, ACTH secretion from dispersed anterior pituitary cells in vitro was unaffected by GAL in concentrations up to 10(-6) M. Furthermore, GAL did not alter CRH (1 nM)-induced ACTH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to further characterize the actions of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) on the function of insulin-producing cells, the effects of different concentrations of the cytokine were studied on islets obtained from four different mouse strains (NMRI, NOD, C57BL/6, and C57BL/Ks). For this purpose the islets were exposed to rIL-1 beta (25, 50, or 100 U/ml) for a 48-h period in medium RPMI 1640 containing 10% calf serum and 11.1 mM glucose. In all groups and at the various rIL-1 beta concentrations tested, there was a similar 30-50% inhibition in glucose-induced insulin release, a 70-80% decrease in islet insulin content, and no significant differences in islet DNA content or insulin accumulation in the culture medium. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the decreased islet insulin content, rates of (pro)insulin biosynthesis and insulin messenger RNA (mRNA) contents were determined. Exposure of NMRI and C57BL/6 islets to 50 U/ml rIL-1 beta reduced the (pro)insulin biosynthesis by 40-50% and the insulin mRNA contents by 80-90%. The cytokine also induced an increased cellular content of the heat shock protein hsp70, as measured by western blot analysis, and a decrease in DNA biosynthesis, as measured by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation. However, exposure to rIL-1 beta did not decrease islet total protein biosynthesis, glucose oxidation, ATP content, ATP/ADP ratio, cAMP content, or polyamine contents. In conclusion, these data suggest that exposure of mouse islets to rIL-1 beta reduces DNA synthesis, insulin mRNA levels, and the biosynthesis of (pro)insulin, without equally impairing other cellular functions. The mechanisms behind these reductions seem to be different from those observed in rat islets, where a rIL-1 beta-induced impairment of substrate metabolism at the mitochondrial level seems to be related to the decrease of several cellular functions.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the widespread distribution of neuropeptide-Y (NPY) in various hypothalamic sites, castration reduced and testosterone (T) replacement restored NPY levels selectively in the median eminence (ME), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and ventromedial nucleus (VMN). Since androgen-concentrating cells and NPY-producing cells display overlapping distribution in the ARC and brain stem (BS), we assessed the participation of BS NPY cells in the steroid-dependent site-specific effects on NPY levels. The BS projections to the hypothalamus were severed by bilateral neural transection (BNT) with a knife lowered on either side of the sagittal sinus to the depth of the dorsal tegmentum in the mesencephalon in intact, castrated, or castrated rats that additionally received sc T implants to maintain physiological T levels. Two weeks later, NPY concentrations in microdissected hypothalamic sites and serum LH and T levels were quantitated by RIA. Castration decreased and T replacement increased NPY concentrations in only three sites, such as the VMN, ARC, and ME. In response to BNT in gonadally intact rats, a different site-specific response of NPY levels was observed; NPY levels decreased in the ME, as seen after castration, and, additionally, decreased in the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus, suggesting that BS NPY neurons innervate these four sites. When castration and BNT were performed simultaneously, a combined regional response was evident. NPY levels decreased in six sites, including two sites (ARC and VMN) that normally respond to castration alone, three sites (medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus) that normally respond to BNT alone, and the ME, the only site that showed reduction of NPY levels of similar magnitude after either castration or BNT, but the response of combined surgery was not additive. This observation suggested that gonadal steroids act outside the hypothalamus to raise ME NPY levels, and therefore, BNT in intact rats impaired the effectiveness of steroids. To test this hypothesis, the effects of physiological T replacement in the castrate plus BNT group were studied. We observed that whereas T replacement readily raised NPY levels in the VMN and ARC, it was completely ineffective in the third T-dependent site, the ME. Collectively, these findings revealed a functional heterogeneity among NPY-producing cells in response to T. Apparently, there are two distinct neural sites in the rat brain where T acts to exert a site-specific stimulatory effect on NPY in the hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The observation of immunodetectable, cell-associated DBP on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and placental cytotrophoblasts had presented the question of the origin, function, and precise subcellular localization of cell-associated DBP. Using anti-human DBP F(ab')2 with fluorescence-activated cytometric analysis and immunogold electron microscopy, we detected DBP on the plasmalemma of U937 cells, a monoblastic, histiocytic cell line grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS). DBP was then removed from FCS by actin affinity chromatography followed by anti-DBP immunoaffinity chromatography. U937 cells in this DBP-free medium exhibited nearly identical growth rates to cells grown in medium containing native FCS. However, in contrast to cells grown with native FCS, those grown for seven to eight generations with DBP-free FCS exhibited less cell-surface DBP as quantified by fluorescence-activated cytometric analysis (73% decrease) and immunoelectron microscopy (88% decrease). DBP mRNA could not be detected in U937 cells, placental tissues, freshly prepared resting and stimulated B and T lymphocytes, or lymphocyte-derived cell lines by Northern analysis. In addition, using the sensitive reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay no DBP fragments were detectable in U937 cells. We conclude that U937 cell-associated DBP is exogenously derived from plasma and is located on the plasmalemma. Based upon this conclusion, we postulate that specific binding sites for DBP may exist on the plasma membranes of certain cell types.\r"

After daily administration of 15 micrograms or 1 microgram IL-1 for 7 consecutive days, serum T4 concentrations rapidly fell to undetectable levels but returned to near control level after the cessation of IL-1. On the 31st day, 3 weeks after the drug cessation, a significant depression of serum T4 was observed again. In addition, the IL-1-treated mouse thyroid showed an in vitro unresponsiveness to TSH, with an increase of pituitary TSH (2.24-fold by 15 micrograms IL-1). To understand underlying mechanisms further, serial observations were performed. Thyroidal T4 contents increased initially, decreased to a low level at day 14, and returned to approximately the control level. IL-1 administration induced an increase in the basal thyroidal cAMP level for a prolonged period. Its response to TSH showed a gradual decline to a level approximately 30% of the control by the 31st day. Pituitary TSH contents on the 22nd and 31st days showed significant elevations. Slight decreases in thyroidal TSH binding and T4 contents also were seen concomitantly. These studies indicate that an administration of a large dose of IL-1 results in a dramatic decrease in serum T4 primarily through the inhibition of T4 release from the thyroid. The results also indicate the induction of a prolonged hypothyroid state due to the unresponsiveness to TSH via a postreceptor mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of bilateral splanchnic nerve (SPLX) section in fetal sheep [116-121 days gestational age (dGA)] on subsequent adrenocortical function was investigated. Fetal cortisol release was stimulated by 1) ACTH-(1-24) administration (100 ng/min for 15 min) at 126-129 and at 132-135 dGA, and 2) nitroprusside-induced hypotension (50% reduction in fetal arterial blood pressure for 10 min) at 129-132 and 136-139 dGA. No differences were observed between SPLX and control fetuses (CONT) in basal arterial plasma concentrations of cortisol from 126-141 dGA. A significant effect of fetal age on basal cortisol was observed in both SPLX and CONT fetuses from 126-141 dGA. A significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) increase in fetal arterial concentrations of cortisol was achieved by ACTH-(1-24) infusion in SPLX and CONT and did not differ between groups at either 126-129 or 132-135 dGA. Hypotension induced a significant increase in fetal plasma cortisol concentrations in SPLX and CONT fetuses (P less than or equal to 0.05). SPLX fetuses secreted significantly less cortisol in response to hypotension than CONT fetuses at both 129-132 and 136-139 dGA (P less than 0.05). Fetal arterial plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ACTH in response to hypotension were not different between CONT and SPLX fetuses. We estimated the half-life of endogenous fetal plasma cortisol after both hypotension and infusion of ACTH-(1-24). There were no differences between either method of inducing cortisol release on the endogenous cortisol half-life, nor were any differences in cortisol half-life observed between SPLX and CONT. At 136-139 dGA the adrenomedullary response to hypotension was abolished in SPLX, confirming completeness of denervation. In conclusion, the splanchnic nerves do not appear to be involved in the normal increase in basal fetal plasma cortisol observed in late gestation in fetal sheep. However, splanchnic nerve modulation of secretion of cortisol in response to stress may be involved in the increased fetal adrenal sensitivity to stress observed late in gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The testis contains many peptides originally described as originating in the central nervous system. The physiological function of these factors in the testis is generally unknown. We previously reported that the rat testis contains both a peptide with GH-releasing hormone-like immunoactivity (tGHRH-LI) and a mRNA species that cross-hybridizes with a hypothalamic cDNA for rat GHRH (rGHRH). The current study was designed to further characterize tGHRH-LI by determining its location within rat testis, and to evaluate whether tGHRH-LI and hypothalamic GHRH share similar biological and electrophoretic properties. Partially purified tGHRH is capable of stimulating GH secretion from cultured anterior pituitary cells in a dose-dependent manner. Testicular GHRH and rGHRH have different HPLC retention times and significantly different electrophoretic properties by Western gel analysis. The estimated size of tGHRH-LI is approximately 3.7 times that of synthetic rGHRH. Using immunohistochemistry, tGHRH-LI is localized to mature sperm forms in rat testis. We conclude that rat tGHRH-LI and rGHRH share some structural and functional properties and are probably related peptides. However, the difference in electrophoretic mobility and HPLC retention time indicates that they are not identical. The presence of tGHRH-LI in rat sperm, within the confines of the blood-testis barrier, which is generally impermeable to peptides, leads us to speculate that tGHRH serves a paracrine or autocrine role in testicular physiology.\r"

We report that liver fat-storing cells (FSC) secrete IGF-I immunoreactivity in the culture medium. Secretion of IGF-I immunoreactivity was blocked in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting de novo synthesis. Culture medium conditioned by FSC was concentrated and applied to a Sephadex G100 column equilibrated in a denaturing buffer. Two major species with apparent mol wts of 7.5 and greater than 25 k were identified by IGF-I RIA. Reverse phase HPLC of the 7.5 kilodalton species (the size of IGF-I) showed that it eluted in a single peak. To determine whether the higher mol wt species possessed IGF-I binding activity, appropriate fractions were desalted, incubated with [125I]IGF-I for 2 h at 30 C and applied to a Sephadex G100 column equilibrated in a nondissociating buffer. The major peak of radioactivity was confined to a high mol wt region. Western blot ligand analysis revealed the presence of two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins of approximately 28 and 31 kilodaltons. Platelet-derived growth factor, a potent mitogen for FSC, resulted in a 230% increase in release of IGF-I immunoreactivity that could be accounted for by an increase in IGF-I binding activity. In addition IGF-I increased DNA synthesis in FSC and this effect was additive to that of platelet-derived growth factor. IGF-I treatment also resulted in an increase in cell number. IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins secreted by FSC may play a role in the hepatic tissue response to injury via autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH exerts paradoxical effects on ovarian cells through specific receptors. Based on observed direct effects of GnRH and its antagonists on ovarian functions, the presence of endogenous ovarian GnRH-like peptide(s) has been postulated. In an attempt to detect the ovarian expression of GnRH or related genes at the RNA level, we used the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify GnRH mRNA levels. Total RNA from rat ovaries was converted to first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and amplified in PCR using a pair of primers complementary to the rat GnRH cDNA. The DNA products obtained were subcloned into plasmid vectors, and their sequences were determined. The most prominent PCR product of 462 basepairs (bp) was unexpectedly identified as a fragment of prothymosin-alpha cDNA previously found in the spleen. This cDNA was obtained because of an identical 10 bp match with the 3' end of one of the GnRH primers. Northern blot analyses using the cloned prothymosin-alpha cDNA as probe revealed the presence of mRNA for this factor in ovary, thymus, testis, placenta, and hypothalamus. RT-PCR amplification of hypothalamus and granulosa cell messages indicated the presence of a 244-bp product with a sequence identical to that of GnRH. To further confirm the presence of GnRH messages in the ovary, a second set of GnRH primers was used. PCR amplification of cDNA from hypothalamus, granulosa cells, and whole ovary yielded a 241-bp product identical to the authentic GnRH sequence based on analysis on both strands. In contrast, no PCR product was evident after amplification of thyroid cDNA. Our data demonstrated the expression of mRNA for GnRH and prothymosin-alpha in the ovary. Although the exact ovarian role of the immune hormone awaits further study, the detection of GnRH transcript in the ovary suggests potential intragonadal roles of this decapeptide.\r"

  ".W": "Porcine granulosa cells isolated from small (1-3 mm in diameter) follicles proliferate rapidly in culture in response to 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) inhibits FBS/EGF-stimulated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We have used this proliferation inhibitory property of TGF beta to assay qualitatively, the presence of this growth factor in conditioned medium from cultured follicle cells as well as in partially purified preparations from porcine ovarian compartments. In addition, the concentration of TGF beta in the theca cell conditioned medium was quantitatively estimated by generating a TGF beta-dose-response curve (inhibition of FBS/EGF-stimulated proliferation of granulosa cells in monolayer culture) using authentic human TGF beta-1. Ovarian thecal cells isolated from small and large size follicles in the pig ovary secrete TGF beta-like activity in vitro. Medium conditioned by thecal cells in primary monolayer culture contains a latent form of TGF beta which can be activated by heat or acid treatment. In contrast, and unlike rat granulosa cells, porcine granulosa cells in primary monolayer culture do not secrete detectable levels of TGF beta-like activity in the medium. Incubation of heat-activated thecal cell conditioned medium with a TGF beta-neutralizing antibody (which recognizes TGF beta-1 and 2) but not nonimmune serum attenuated the TGF beta-like activity in thecal cell conditioned medium suggesting that this activity is due to authentic TGF beta. Since many cell types secrete latent TGF beta in the medium when cultured in vitro, we next investigated whether thecal cell secretion of latent TGF beta was a function of cell culture or whether the ovarian thecal compartment actually contained detectable levels of TGF beta-like activity. To this end, we used an acid-ethanol extraction procedure to isolate thecal proteins from fresh-frozen tissue. The acid-ethanol extracted protein fraction was mixed with trace amounts of 125I-TGF beta for detection and chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-60 column under acidic conditions. Elution of TGF beta bioactivity from the Bio-Gel P-60 column as measured by inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation correlated with the elution of radioiodinated authentic TGF beta. Preincubation of TGF beta-like activity-containing fractions with TGF beta-neutralizing antibody attenuated the proliferation-inhibitory activity in these fractions. TGF beta activity was also observed in fractions extracted from porcine corpora lutea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91031271\r", 
  ".W": "We have reported recently that central administration of both the alpha- and beta-subtypes of the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibited the estrogen-progesterone-induced LH surge in ovariectomized (ovx) rats. This inhibition was probably due to a central effect, since IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta also suppressed the in vitro LHRH output from the hypothalami of steroid-primed ovx rats. Whether IL-1 inhibits LHRH release by a direct action or via some other neuronal system is not known. Since IL-1 reportedly stimulates the release of POMC peptides, which are known to be inhibitory to the LHRH-LH axis, we have tested the hypothesis that the inhibitory influence of IL-1 may be mediated via activation of hypothalamic opioid peptides. Ovx rats, preimplanted with cannulae in the third ventricle of the brain, were injected with 30 micrograms estradiol benzoate, followed by 2 mg progesterone 48 h later. Three hours after P injection, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or saline (SAL) was injected intracerebroventricularly (30 ng/3 microliters) at 1300 h, followed immediately by iv infusion of SAL or the opiate antagonist naloxone hydrochloride (NAL; 2 mg/0.6 ml.h) for 2 h. Plasma LH levels were measured in blood samples withdrawn hourly until 1800 h. Both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta blocked the afternoon LH surge. NAL infusion into control SAL-injected rats did not alter the LH surge; however, it reversed the IL-1 alpha- and IL-1 beta-induced suppression of the LH surge. To determine whether this reversal of IL-1 suppression of the LH surge was due to NAL action at the hypothalamic level, the preoptic area-medial basal hypothalamus of similarly primed ovx rats was obtained at 1300 h and incubated in vitro in the presence of 10 nM IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta with or without 100 micrograms/ml NAL. Both subtypes of IL-1 suppressed LHRH output significantly. NAL alone did not affect LHRH release, but it completely reversed the inhibitory effects of the cytokine on LHRH release. These results suggest that IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta inhibit LHRH-LH release by stimulating the activity of hypothalamic endogenous opioid peptide systems.\r"

On day 100 of gestation, fetuses were removed and placentas left in situ (fetectomy). On days 100-155 of gestation after fetectomy, baboons received 50 mg androstenedione pellets sc in increasing numbers (1-3 every 10 days, n = 8), were injected sc with estradiol (E2) benzoate (0.50-2.5 mg/day, n = 8), or were not further treated (n = 6). Placentas were obtained on day 160, and cells were dispersed in 0.1% collagenase, isolated on 50% Percoll, then incubated for 24 h at 37 C in medium 199. Mean (+/- SE) peripheral serum E2 (nanograms per ml) in untreated baboons (n = 5) was 1.33 +/- 0.06 on days 101-160. Fetectomy decreased (P less than 0.001) E2 to 0.28 +/- 0.04, and androstenedione and E2 after fetectomy increased serum E2 to 0.75 +/- 0.08 and 2.51 +/- 0.23, respectively. Serum IGF-I (nanograms per ml) determined by RIA was 182 +/- 6 on days 101-160 in controls. Serum IGF-I increased (P less than 0.001) rapidly after fetectomy to 403 +/- 22 on days 101-160 and fell precipitously to 185 +/- 8 after placental delivery. Androstenedione and E2 treatment after fetectomy decreased IGF-I to 291 +/- 16 and 239 +/- 6, respectively, values similar to those before fetectomy. Uterine vein concentrations of IGF-I were similar to those in peripheral maternal serum, and the same relative treatment effects were observed. IGF-I secretion (picograms per ml/24 h) by placental trophoblasts of fetectomized baboons (80.1 +/- 9.8) was 242% greater (P less than 0.001) than controls (23.4 +/- 4.7) and decreased after fetectomy by androstenedione (56.7 +/- 15.1) and E2 (62.3 +/- 12.8). Thus, removal of the fetus decreased serum E2 and markedly elevated placental production and maternal serum levels of IGF-I, and these effects were largely reversed by androstenedione or E2. We suggest that the fetus, via secretion of estrogen precursors, regulates placental IGF-I production and consequently maternal serum concentrations of IGF-I during primate pregnancy.\r"

  ".U": "91031275\r", 
  ".W": "There exists considerable evidence to suggest that CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-secreting parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are central integrators of negative feedback effects evoked by circulating glucocorticoid hormones. Most evidence suggests that these neurons may be receptive to circulating glucocorticoid levels, either via glucocorticoid receptors indigenous to these cells and/or via extrahypothalamic glucocorticoid-receptive neurons interacting with the PVN secretory cell. In an effort to address this issue, we performed anterior (ANT), posterior (POST) and total (TOT) deafferentations of the PVN region in male Sprague-Dawley rats using microknives fashioned from narrow-gauge spinal needles. Effective knife cuts were verified immunohistochemically, and deemed acceptable only if they avoided damage to the PVN proper and fibers of CRH and AVP-containing neurons coursing through the hypothalamus en route to the median eminence, while effectively eliminating neuronal input into the PVN region. Subsequent to surgery, levels of mRNA encoding for CRH and AVP in the parvocellular and magnocellular PVN were assayed via semiquantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry. Results indicate that TOT deafferentations resulted in significant increases in CRH mRNA expression in the PVN, and a slight but noticeable induction of AVP mRNA in the medial parvocellular but not posterior magnocellular divisions of the PVN. ANT lesions also produced an up-regulation of CRH and AVP mRNA relative to operated control rats. POST lesions did not produce a clear induction in either CRH or AVP mRNA. The data indicate that in the absence of neuronal input coming from anterior structures, CRH mRNA expression is up-regulated, suggesting that local effects of glucocorticoids on the PVN neuron are ineffective in maintaining normal CRH mRNA expression. These results support a role for neuronal feedback in regulation of the CRH neuron. The limited up-regulation (compared with adrenalectomized rats) of AVP mRNA in the TOT group suggests that while neuronal input may have some control of AVP mRNA expression, local glucocorticoid feedback is clearly able to restrict AVP message to levels considerably less than those seen in steroid-deficient animals. Analysis of knife-cut effects on plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels reveals that POST and TOT, but not ANT, deafferentations prohibit the secretory activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis seen pursuant to the anesthesia/thoracotomy in lesion and operated control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Since circulating proinsulin has been suggested to be important in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes, and biosynthetic human proinsulin (HPI) may have a therapeutic role in patients with diabetes mellitus, the biological activity of proinsulin metabolites is of potential significance. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the majority of circulating proinsulin immunoreactivity consists of metabolites. We, therefore, compared the blood glucose-lowering ability and MCR of the two proinsulin metabolites des-(31,32)HPI and des-(64,65)HPI with intact HPI in seven anesthetized dogs after an overnight fast. Intravenous bolus injections of 12.5 micrograms HPI/kg BW and equimolar amounts of des-(31,32)HPI and des-(64,65)HPI were given on three separate occasions. In addition to blood glucose, des-(31,33)HPI, des-(64,65)HPI, and HPI were measured using an insulin RIA and peptide-specific standard curves. Kinetic parameters were derived by fitting two exponentials to the respective decay curves. The MCR of HPI (3.3 +/- 0.1 ml/kg.min) was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that of des-(64,65)HPI (6.4 +/- 0.6 ml/kg.min), but was not significantly different from that of des-(31,32)HPI (3.8 +/- 0.4 ml/kg.min). The MCR of biosynthetic insulin (17.2 +/- 1.8 ml/kg.min), as measured in three of the dogs, was higher than that of HPI or the two metabolites. The blood glucose-lowering ability (defined as nadir glucose/fasting glucose, expressed as a percentage) of des-(64,65)HPI (49.3 +/- 5.0%) was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that of intact HPI (87 +/- 2.2%), and the glucose-lowering ability of des-(31,32)HPI (75.2 +/- 3.8%) was intermediate. In conclusion, HPI metabolites are more biologically active than intact HPI. The extent of in vivo conversion of proinsulin to metabolites may enhance the biological activity of proinsulin and, thus, have physiological, pathophysiological, and therapeutic significance.\r"

  ".W": "Galanin (GAL), a 29-amino acid peptide originally isolated from porcine intestine, has been shown to be widely distributed not only in the gut, but also in the central nervous system. Several studies have shown that GAL participates in the hypothalamic regulation of PRL, GH, and LH secretion. In this study, we evaluate the effects of rat GAL (rGAL) on LHRH and prostaglandin (PG) E2 release from arcuate nucleus-median eminence fragments in vitro. Fragments were incubated for 30-min periods in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing the different test substances. The addition to the medium of rGAL in concentrations ranging from 5-1000 nM increased the release of both LHRH and PGE2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The ED50 values were approximately 55 and 80 nM for LHRH and PGE2, respectively. rGAL-induced LHRH and PGE2 release were related, as suggested by the finding that the addition to the medium of indomethacin (10 microM), a PG synthesis blocker, completely blocked rGAL-induced LHRH release. In addition, an active catecholaminergic system appears to be necessary for obtaining the stimulatory effect of rGAL. The addition to the medium of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine or prazosin impaired the ability of rGAL to release both LHRH and PGE2. rGAL-induced stimulation of LHRH and PGE2 release was blocked by phentolamine at doses of 1-10 microM, while prazosin was able to block it at doses as low as 0.1 microM. In summary, rGAL stimulates LHRH and PGE2 release from arcuate nucleus-median eminence fragments in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. Such an effect is blocked by both indomethacin and alpha-adrenergic blockers, indicating that rGAL-induced stimulation of LHRH secretion is exerted through alpha-adrenergic receptors and requires PGE2 as an intracellular mediator.\r"

The present study examined the ability of centrally administered NPY to affect LH secretion in the primate. Human NPY (hNPY) was administered into the third cerebroventricle of unanesthetized, freely moving, ovariectomized (OVX), or estradiol (E2)-treated OVX rhesus monkeys. LH was measured in blood samples collected remotely at 10-min intervals throughout the experiments. An extensive range of NPY doses was tested in a preliminary study in which OVX monkeys received a 3-h control infusion of Krebs Ringer phosphate buffer (KRP) followed immediately by a 3-h infusion of hNPY (0.1-50 micrograms/h). Only doses greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/h produced a consistent and marked suppression of LH (5 micrograms/h; 35.1 +/- 7.2% reduction, P less than 0.05, n = 4). A longer duration study was performed to better characterize changes in LH pulse frequency and amplitude produced by hNPY treatment. We administered 5 micrograms/h and 15 micrograms/h to OVX (n = 5) and E2-treated OVX (n = 4) monkeys according to the following protocol: 8 h control KRP/8-h hNPY/6-h recovery KRP. In OVX monkeys, LH was suppressed after 2 to 3 h of peptide infusion (P less than 0.01); LH secretion returned to normal after treatment. Both doses of hNPY suppressed mean LH by approximately 55% (P less than 0.05) and LH pulse frequency by approximately 69% (P less than 0.025). LH pulse amplitude was unaffected. In E2-treated OVX monkeys, neither dose of hNPY affected mean LH or LH pulse amplitude. LH pulse frequency was suppressed by approximately 65% (P less than 0.05) during 15-micrograms/h treatment. Because centrally administered hNPY reduced LH pulse frequency and thereby mean LH levels, our results support a central, neural action of NPY to affect the GnRH/LH secretory system. The ability of estrogen feedback to alter the response to NPY treatment supports a physiological role for NPY in controlling reproduction in the primate.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the relationship between localization of estrogen receptor (ER) and selected cell responses induced by estrogen in the neonatal CD-1 mouse uterus. The following simultaneous staining techniques were used to determine whether only uterine epithelial cells with ER are capable of showing proliferative and secretory activities after estrogen treatment: 1) ER localization and [3H]thymidine incorporation using immunohistochemistry and autoradiography; and 2) immunohistochemical double staining of ER and an estrogen-induced secretory protein lactoferrin (LF). Uterine tissues from two strains (CD-1 and BALB/c) mice on day 4 of age showed detectable ER by immunostaining in both epithelial and stromal cells. Day 4 CD-1 mice received a single injection of diethylstilbestrol (DES; 20 micrograms/kg BW). The percentage of ER-immunostained uterine epithelial cells and the intensity of the staining rapidly increased from 6-36 h, indicating that estrogen stimulates the expression and detectability of ER during the course of hormone treatment. Twenty-eight and 81% of epithelial cells showed positive ER immunostaining 6 and 24 h, respectively, after the DES treatment. The intensity of ER-immunostained stromal cells, however, was slightly decreased by the treatment. DES administration elicited epithelial cell proliferation. Labeling indices of epithelial cells reached a maximum (approximately 44%) 12 h after an injection of DES, and a second small peak was recognized 24 h after the treatment. Labeling indices of positively ER-immunostained epithelial cells and those of negatively stained epithelial cells showed almost the same pattern for 6-18 h after treatment. The respective maximum values were 45% and 43%. When day 4 mice were given three daily injections of DES in saline and killed 12 and 24 h after the last injection, significant amounts of LF were recognized in the apical cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. The epithelial cells that showed LF immunostaining always exhibited ER immunostaining in the nuclei. These results suggest that exogenous estrogen elicits increased expression of ER, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation in neonatal uterine epithelial cells associated with low levels of ER, while there was a direct relationship with the presence of ER in epithelial cells and the induction of LF.\r"

Microsome samples were incubated at 40 C for 90 min in Tris buffer (pH 8.3) with 1.0 mM CaCl2 added. The substrate, radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine, was incorporated into liposomes. During spontaneous regression, there was a significant 2- to 4-fold increase in phospholipase A2 activity, when compared with levels at mid-pseudopregnancy (days 8-9). This elevation was correlated with a significant decrease in plasma progesterone concentration. On day 6 or 7 of pseudopregnancy, treatment of rats with luteolytic doses of prostaglandin F2 alpha also caused a significant increase in phospholipase A2 activity, which remained elevated throughout the 72-h sampling period. In pregnant rats there was a small but significant rise in phospholipase A2 activity after parturition. These results indicate that the activity of phospholipase A2 increases during luteal regression in pregnant and pseudopregnant rats and that it could be involved in the mechanism that causes the loss in progesterone secretion.\r"

Certain Leydig cell responses were monitored 1, 2, and 3 days after the hCG injection. The down-regulation of LH receptors and blockage of the 17-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase step in adult testis, and the absence of these responses in neonatal testis were confirmed. Novel data were obtained on concomitant responses of LH receptor and steroidogenic enzyme messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The LH receptor mRNA was increased 4-5-fold by 2 days after hCG injection in the neonatal testis (P less than 0.05), but in the adult was decreased during all 3 days by 50% (P less than 0.05). The mRNA level of the cytochrome P450 for cholesterol side chain cleavage responded similarly at both ages, with a 180-260% increase during 2 and 3 days (P less than 0.05-0.01). In contrast, the 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P450 mRNAs displayed opposite responses, increasing 4.5-fold in 2 days (P less than 0.01) in the neonates, but decreasing by 80% in 1 day in the adults (P less than 0.01). No response of the aromatase cytochrome P450 mRNA to hCG stimulation was found at either age studied. These results demonstrate that the functional differences of the neonatal and adult Leydig cells to high gonadotropic stimulation occur at the level of expression of specific genes, including those of the LH receptor and the 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P450. Although aromatization of testicular androgens has been suggested to mediate the blockade of the 17-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase step in adult testes, altered steady state levels of aromatase mRNA are not involved in this response. LH receptor mRNA decreases in adult rat testis in response to treatment with high levels of hCG. Thus, this phenomenon of down-regulation of membrane receptors includes a decreased LH receptor mRNA as well as cellular internalization of the existing receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) is an important intraovarian peptide that stimulates granulosa cell steroidogenesis during follicular development. The cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone is the rate-limiting step in progesterone biosynthesis. Since treatment of primary cultures of immature porcine granulosa cells with IGF-I will increase progesterone production as well as the synthesis of immunoprecipitable P450scc enzyme, we examined possible molecular mechanisms subserving these inductive effects of IGF-I. To this end, cultures of porcine granulosa cells were maintained in serum-free medium with or without IGF-I under various treatment paradigms. Cellular concentrations of specific P450scc mRNA were measured by Northern blot hybridization using a 32P-labeled 1-kilobase porcine cDNA clone. Northern blot autoradiogram densitometry data were normalized with a constitutively expressed 1.2-kilobase chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA clone. Steroidogenesis was monitored by measuring concomitant progesterone accumulation in the culture medium. Treatment with pure recombinant human IGF-I (100 ng/ml) significantly increased P450scc mRNA concentrations after 18 h, and maximal stimulation (10- to 20-fold) occurred by 48 h for both P450scc mRNA and progesterone accumulation. The IGF-I dose-response curve studied at 48 h showed a significant increase in P450scc mRNA levels at a minimal IGF-I concentration of 1 ng/ml (although progesterone production was not increased). Treatment with equimolar concentrations of epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, or insulin significantly increased P450scc mRNA concentrations, whereas fibroblast growth factor did not. To examine possible mechanisms underlying stimulation of P450scc by IGF-I, immature granulosa cells were treated with aminoglutethimide (a P450scc enzyme inhibitor), low density lipoprotein (to increase cholesterol delivery to granulosa cells), or estradiol in the presence or absence of IGF-I. Aminoglutethimide had no effect, alone or with IGF-I, on P450scc mRNA concentrations, but suppressed progesterone production. Low density lipoprotein alone also did not stimulate P450scc mRNA levels and only slightly increased progesterone accumulation, but acted synergistically with IGF-I to augment P450scc mRNA concentrations and progesterone accumulation. Estradiol alone did not stimulate P450scc mRNA concentrations, but did significantly increase progesterone production. Estradiol cotreatment with IGF-I synergistically enhanced progesterone production, but did not alter IGF-I-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These cell lines secrete progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one in response to stimulation with 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, or cholera toxin at levels similar to primary cultures of granulosa cells (500 ng/10(6) cells/48 h). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate inhibits progesterone production induced by 8-bromo-cAMP (67%, P less than 0.001), forskolin (88%, P less than 0.001), and cholera toxin (75%, P less than 0.001), in spite of enhancing cAMP accumulation (200%, P less than 0.001) in response to forskolin or cholera toxin. LH, FSH, prostaglandins E1 and E2, and PRL do not stimulate progesterone production. The beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, stimulates significantly both cAMP accumulation (80%, P less than 0.05) and progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one secretion (70%, P less than 0.05). In contrast to primary cultured cells in which progesterone secretion increases within 90 min of stimulation, in the cell lines progesterone secretion becomes evident only after 12-24 h of stimulation. The stimulation of these lines by forskolin produced a maximum rise in intracellular cAMP levels at 45 min which declined to 50% (P less than 0.001) of this value within 12 h. It was found that cAMP suppressed growth concomitantly with induction of steroidogenesis when cotransfected cells were examined for growth by total cell protein and [3H]thymidine incorporation to DNA. These granulosa cell lines are uniquely suited for further studies of cAMP induction and the role of oncogenes in steroidogenesis.\r"

In the current work, characteristics of the tyrosine kinase responsible for the in vitro phosphorylation of GH receptors from cultured 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were examined, and the presence of this GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity was demonstrated in multiple cell types. GH-receptor complexes from GH-treated cells were partially purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-GH antibodies and then incubated as an immune complex with [gamma 32P] ATP. Incorporation of 32P into the GH receptor from 3T3-F442A fibroblasts was apparent within 1 min at 30 C after the addition of [gamma 32P]ATP (5-10 microM). A divalent cation was requisite for the phosphorylation; Mn2+ was significantly more effective than Mg2+ and Co2+; Ba2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ had no effect. Excess unlabeled ATP, but not cytosine triphosphate, GTP, or uridine triphosphate, abolished 32P incorporation into the GH receptor and [gamma 32P]GTP could not replace [gamma 32P]ATP as a source of 32P. At 5.5 mM Mn2+, phosphorylation exhibited a biphasic dose response to ATP, with maximal phosphorylation occurring at a concentration of 10 microM ATP. At more physiological concentrations of ATP (1 mM), phosphorylation of the GH receptor was also stimulated by lower concentrations of Mn2+ (as low as 500 nM). Optimal reaction conditions determined for the phosphorylation reaction in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were used to demonstrate incorporation of 32P from [gamma 32P]ATP into partially purified GH receptors from cultured human IM-9 lymphocytes, murine 3T3-F442A adipocytes, rat H-35 hepatoma cells, and freshly isolated rat adipocytes. The 32P was shown to be incorporated into tyrosyl residues in receptors from the two cell types tested (IM-9 lymphocytes and rat adipocytes). Cross-linked [125I] hGH-receptor complexes solubilized from the four cell types (IM-9 lymphocytes, 3T3-F442A adipocytes, H-35 hepatoma cells, and freshly isolated rat adipocytes) bound to and could be eluted from phosphotyrosyl antibody, suggesting that tyrosyl phosphorylation of GH receptors in all of these cells occurs in vivo. The presence of tyrosine kinase activity associated with GH receptors in multiple cell types from different species is consistent with tyrosine kinase activity playing a role in the actions of GH.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of GnRH agonists and antagonists suppresses pituitary LH secretion. However little is known about their effects on endogenous GnRH secretion. To determine if GnRH analogs act on GnRH secretion through a short or ultrashort loop feedback mechanism, experiments were performed to analyze GnRH secretion in hypophyseal portal blood of conscious short-term castrated rams under both agonist or antagonist treatment. In Study 1, six rams were castrated and surgically prepared for portal blood collection on day -7. Portal and peripheral blood were collected simultaneously every 10 min for 14-15 h on day 0. Five hours after the beginning of the portal blood collection, animals were injected im with 5 mg potent GnRH antagonist (Nal-Glu). In Study 2, six rams were treated daily from day -11 to day 0 with the GnRH agonist D-Trp6 GnRH (0.5 mg im). Castration and surgical preparation for portal blood collection were performed on day -7. On day 0 portal and peripheral blood were collected simultaneously every 10 min for 10-11 h. In both studies, to determine whether an increase in GnRH concentration in hypophyseal portal blood can overcome the inhibitory effect of the GnRH analogs, between 5 and 5.5 h after the injection of the analogs, endogenous GnRH secretion was stimulated by Naloxone administration (3 x 100 mg, iv, at 30-min intervals) followed by a bolus of exogenous GnRH (2 x 10 micrograms, iv at 30-min intervals). In Study 1, Nal-Glu administration led to a rapid cessation of pulsatile LH secretion for the duration of blood collection while GnRH pulse frequency and amplitude were not affected. GnRH and LH pulse frequency before and after Nal-Glu administration were, 6.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.8 (NS) and 5.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.2 pulses/6 h (P less than 0.001) respectively. In Study 2, peripheral LH secretion was completely suppressed while GnRH secretion (portal blood) remained pulsatile. GnRH pulses frequency and pulse amplitude were 4.3 +/- 0.3 pulses/6 h and 43.0 +/- 4.7 pg/ml, respectively. In both experiments, neither stimulation of endogenous GnRH secretion by naloxone nor administration of exogenous GnRH allowed reinitiation of LH secretion. However, additional studies in two animals of each treatment group (study-III) showed that this was clearly a dose related effect in antagonist treated but not in agonist-treated animals since higher doses of exogenous GnRH (i.e. 100 micrograms or 1000 micrograms) can increase significantly LH levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies with the thiol-specific reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) and the vicinal dithiol-specific reagent sodium arsenite have established that 2 spatially close thiols (i.e. vicinal dithiols) are involved in steroid binding to the intact 98 K rat glucocorticoid receptor. These 2 thiols form an intramolecular disulfide after treatment with low concentrations of MMTS. One of these thiols was proposed to by Cys-656. In an effort to identify both thiols, we have examined the effects of MMTS and arsenite on proteolytic fragments of the receptor, which contain progressively fewer cysteines. MMTS and arsenite are now found to cause the same dithiothreitol-reversible inhibition of steroid binding and affinity labeling of both the 42 K chymotrypsin fragment and the 16 K steroid-binding core fragment of the receptor as was seen for the intact receptor. Characteristic responses include a bimodal inhibition curve for steroid binding after preincubation with MMTS and an inhibition of binding by very low concentrations of arsenite. Low concentrations of MMTS could block steroid binding by forming a disulfide bond between the receptor and a tightly associated, nonreceptor protein. However, no evidence for such cross-linking was observed when intact 98 K receptors, 42 K chymotrypsin fragments, or 16 K trypsin fragments were treated with various concentrations of MMTS, separated on nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by Western blotting with antiheat shock protein 90 or antireceptor antibodies. One of the antireceptor antibodies (aP1) that had been raised against the rat receptor sequence 440-795 was now found to recognize at least 1 epitope in the 16 K core fragment. We conclude that the vicinal dithiols involved in steroid binding are 2 of the 3 cysteines in the sequence of Thr537-Arg673.\r"

  ".U": "91031293\r", 
  ".W": "The episodic secretion of GH is regulated through the reciprocal release into the hypophyseal portal circulation of two hypothalamic peptides, SRIF and GRF. Recent physiological evidence suggests that, in addition to exerting their well documented opposite actions at the level of the anterior pituitary, SRIF and GRF may interact within the central nervous system to modulate GH secretion. The aim of the present study was to provide morphological evidence to support the concept that SRIF exerts an influence on the GRF-containing neuronal system within the hypothalamus. To accomplish this, we used the thiol agent cysteamine (CSH; 300 mg/kg sc) to manipulate endogenous hypothalamic SRIF and examined its effects on the immunoreactivity and mRNA content of GRF-containing arcuate (ARC) neurons, using immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative in situ hybridization, respectively. Hypothalamic SRIF content and pulsatile GH secretion were also monitored. CSH treatment reduced hypothalamic immunoreactive SRIF concentrations (to 60% of vehicle-injected control values) and severely suppressed the spontaneous surges of GH release (mean GH peak amplitude: 24.2 +/- 2.7 vs. 168.0 +/- 27.8 ng/ml in H2O-injected controls; P less than 0.001). CSH treatment also resulted in a striking increase in the number and labeling density of GRF-immunoreactive cells detected in the ARC nucleus. Cell counts revealed an overall 126% increase, over controls, in the mean number of detectable GRF-positive ARC neurons. This increase (P less than 0.01) was apparent over all rostrocaudal levels of the ARC nucleus, but was most pronounced within the caudal tier. Administration of CSH also produced a massive qualitative increase in the intensity and extent of staining of GRF-positive terminal elements in the external zone of the median eminence. Conversely, CSH treatment resulted in a decline in GRF mRNA-associated signal in cells of the ARC nucleus, with this decline being most evident in the caudal third of the nucleus. The finding of an increase in GRF immunoreactivity in ARC neurons in association with a decrease in plasma GH, as well as with a decline in relative GRF mRNA content, suggests that CSH leads to an overall decrease in GRF release from the median eminence. These results provide morphological evidence to support the concept of a SRIF-mediated central influence on the GRF-containing ARC neuronal system. Such central regulation of GRF by SRIF may be an important mechanism in the physiological control of pulsatile GH secretion.\r"

To that end, insulin receptors from mixed, red and white skeletal muscle from control and 19-20 days pregnant rats were partially purified and insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activities were evaluated. Muscle insulin receptors from diabetic rats were also studied provided that changes in receptor number and tyrosine kinase activities had been clearly substantiated. Total high affinity insulin binding sites expressed either per gram of tissue or per milligram of protein were similar in muscles from control and pregnant rats, in contrast to diabetic rats in which an increased high affinity receptor number was observed. No differences in affinity were detected for high affinity binding sites in any of the groups investigated. The integrity of the partially purified insulin receptors from control and pregnant groups was identical as determined by affinity cross-linking of [125I-TyrB26]insulin to the receptor and by beta-subunit phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit and the pattern of phosphopeptides obtained after digestion of phosphorylated beta-subunit with trypsin, elastase, and staphylococcal V8 protease were indistinguishable in control and pregnant groups. Tyrosine receptor kinase was also similar in receptor preparations from control and pregnant muscle. This is in contrast to diabetes in which a defective tyrosine kinase was confirmed. In order to detect possible differences due to the fiber type, further sets of experiments were performed in receptor preparations from red and white muscle. In keeping with previous data, tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor was 2.5-fold greater in red muscle than white muscle; however, under these conditions, receptor kinase activity was unmodified in preparations from pregnant rats in red and white muscle fibers. Recent evidence has revealed the existence of an insulin binding inhibitor in muscle extracts. We detected the presence of such an inhibitor in the flow-through fraction after WGA chromatography. This inhibitory activity was found to be greater in muscle extracts obtained from pregnant rats as compared to fractions from control rats. We conclude that insulin resistance of skeletal muscle at late pregnancy is not explained by intrinsic modifications of insulin receptor binding or kinase activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The biologically inactive 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13 didecanoate had no effect on flagellar motility. Basal motility was markedly reduced in the absence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium, but TPA-induced sperm motility persisted even in the absence of Ca2+. Sperm motility was also enhanced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in a Ca2(+)-dependent, protein kinase c (PKC)-independent fashion. Although all stimulants examined here reached maximal response at about 15 min of incubation, nevertheless whereas the effect of TPA and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol declined at 60 min of incubation, that of ionomycin still persisted. Human sperm PKC activity is extremely low and represents only about 20% and 25% of the specific activity recovered from PC-12 and rat pituitary cells, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis using various type-specific PKC antibodies revealed staining only in the equatorial segment and the principal piece of the tail. Thus, PKC is present in human ejaculated sperm and is involved in flagellar motility.\r"

  ".U": "91031296\r", 
  ".W": "Pig ovarian follicular membranes contain a gonadotropin-responsive adenylyl cyclase, which becomes partially desensitized (approximately 40%) upon a 40-min incubation with a saturating concentration of human (h) CG. This in vitro desensitization is time and hormone dependent and also requires the presence of micromolar concentrations of GTP. In this report we show that 10% ethanol present during the desensitization phase of the incubation increases the extent of hCG-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase by 2-fold. Ethanol shortened the time necessary to reach maximal hCG-induced desensitization from 20 to 10 min, but had no effect on the dose dependency for GTP. In addition, ethanol had no effect on the affinity of the LH/hCG receptor for 125I-hCG but did cause an increase in the ED50 of hCG for inducing desensitization from 0.25 to 0.75 nM. Interestingly, ethanol decreased the apparent number of LH/hCG-receptor sites by 55%, yet the control hCG-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity was not reduced. The \"hyperdesensitized\" state achieved in the presence of ethanol could not be reversed by washing the membranes and incubating them in ethanol-free medium. NaF-sensitive adenylyl cyclase was also not impaired in hCG-desensitized membranes from control or ethanol-treated samples. Thus, hCG-induced desensitization was not due to a defect in the functioning of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G8) or catalytic subunits, but rather was caused by an impairment of the coupling of the lutropin (LH)/hCG receptor with G8, which was exacerbated further by ethanol. In spite of the effect of ethanol on hCG-induced desensitization, this agent had an inhibitory effect on isoproterenol-induced desensitization of isoproterenol-responsive luteal adenylyl cyclase. These results indicate that membrane fluidity is important in modulating the structure and functional interaction of the LH/hCG receptor with G8 because ethanol is a well known lipid-fluidizing agent. The resistance to ethanol potentiation of desensitization of the isoproterenol-sensitive adenylyl cyclase suggests that there are differences between the LH/hCG- and beta-adrenergic receptors in factors controlling their structures and or interactions with G proteins, and that there is a fundamental difference in their mechanisms of desensitization.\r"

This failure has been related to a mutation within the M-CSF coding region. We report now that the administration of recombinant human M-CSF (rhM-CSF) corrects in vivo the impaired bone resorption in this animal. The treatment restores the bone marrow cavity virtually absent in the op/op animal and induces the appearance of resorbing osteoclasts and of resident bone marrow macrophages. This proves that the deficiency of M-CSF is the cause of the op/op bone disorder and that this cytokine is directly or indirectly necessary for physiological osteoclastogenesis, the resulting bone resorption and for the establishment of bone marrow hemopoiesis.\r"

Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed three specifically-stained PRL-IRs. A doublet of bands at 35.6 and 33.6 kDa was associated with the particulate fraction of the cell. These PRL-IRs were present in lymphocytes independently of mitogen stimulation. In contrast, a 22 kDa PRL-IR was only produced in mitogen stimulated cells, and was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-PRL antiserum. In addition, all three PRL-like IRs incorporated 35S-methionine in vitro, indicating that they are synthesized by these cells. Only the 22 kDa PRL-like protein was present in culture medium from stimulated cells, suggesting that this may be the PRL bioactivity previously demonstrated in SNs from murine lymphocytes.\r"

In the present study, we used in vitro autoradiography to examine the distribution of I-MEL binding in the ferret brain and pituitary. We report that I-MEL binding is restricted to the PT and pars distalis (PD) of the pituitary; I-MEL binding is absent from brain. I-MEL binds in the PT and PD with high affinity (Kd values ca. 40 pM) and the rank order of potency for inhibition of I-MEL binding (6-chloromelatonin = melatonin greater than 6-hydroxymelatonin greater than N-acetylserotonin greater than serotonin) is the same as that observed for high-affinity melatonin receptors from other species. The consistent presence of high affinity melatonin receptors in the PT of a variety of photoperiodic species suggests that the PT plays a major role in mediating the effects of melatonin on neuroendocrine function.\r"

  ".W": "The vagus is a mixed nerve carrying somatic and visceral afferents and efferents. The majority of vagal nerve fibers are visceral afferents and have a wide distribution throughout the central nervous system (CNS) either monosynaptically or via the nucleus of the solitary tract. Besides activation of well-defined reflexes, vagal stimulation produces evoked potentials recorded from the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. Activation of vagal afferents can depress monosynaptic reflexes, decrease the activity of spinothalamic neurons, and increase pain threshold. Depending on the stimulation parameters, vagal afferent stimulation in experimental animals can produce electroencephalographic (EEG) synchronization or desynchronization and has been shown to affect sleep states. The desychronization of the EEG appears to depend on activation of afferent fibers that have conduction velocities of less than or equal to 15 m/s. Vagal afferent stimulation can also influence the activity of interictal cortical spikes produced by topical strychnine application, and either attenuate or stop seizures produced by pentylenetetrazol, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid, maximal electroshock, and topical alumina gel. The mechanisms for the antiepileptic effects of vagal stimulation are not fully understood but probably relate to effects on the reticular activating system. The vagus provides an easily accessible, peripheral route to modulate CNS function.\r"

Pilot studies to perfect the equipment, determine stimulation thresholds, and insure the comfort and safety of the animals preceded this study. Four monkeys were equipped with an indwelling, 2-electrode cuff (titanium bands spaced 7 mm apart; silicone encased; 1.5 cm total length) in contact around the right vagus nerve; avoidance of the cardiac branch was confirmed by electrocardiograms. After postsurgical recovery, the intact and awake animals received constant-current stimulation (5 mA; 83 Hz, 143 Hz, or 50-250 Hz randomly; 0.5-ms pulse width) at the onset of every spontaneous seizure for the duration of the seizure or every 3 h for 40 s if stimulation had not occurred in the preceding hour. Stimulation periods of 2-6 weeks, with differing levels of stimulation, were preceded and followed by at least a 2-week baseline period of no stimulation. During the stimulation periods, the seizure rate decreased to zero in two monkeys and the interseizure intervals became invariable in the remaining two monkeys. These effects carried over temporarily into the poststimulation baseline periods. Vagal stimulation had no consistent effects on seizure severity or EEG interictal spikes. Histological studies of six vagus nerves were unable to separate electrode cuff damage from any direct effects stimulation may have had on the nerves. Although it appears that chronic vagal stimulation is feasible and that epileptogenic processes are influenced, the safety and efficacy of the procedure are still in question.\r"

Chronically implanted electrode arrays may produce neural injury by either mechanical factors or by continuous, high-frequency electrical stimulation. The margin of safety to avoid electrically induced injury may be increased by minimizing the frequency or total stimulation time, and by the use of an intermittent duty cycle.

Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator. Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied. Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution. Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes. Muscle paralysis confirms this observation. Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep.\r"

We report here the results and conclusions from studies designed to answer some of the immediate questions raised by this finding. (1) Maximal stimulation of vagal C fibers at frequencies greater than 4 Hz prevents or reduces chemically and electrically induced seizures in young male rats. (2) Antiepileptic potency is directly related to the fraction of vagal C fibers stimulated. (3) Vagal stimulation shortens but does not shut down a chemical seizure once it has begun. (4) In rats, optimal stimulus frequency is approximately 10-20 Hz; duration of stimulus, 0.5-1 ms; and stimulus strength, 0.2-0.5 mA/mm2 of nerve cross-section. These results, when taken together with similar results obtained from dogs, monkeys, and humans, strongly suggest that periodic stimulation of the vagus nerve using appropriate stimulation parameters is a powerful method for preventing seizures. The data from the literature suggest that the antiepileptic actions of vagal stimulation are largely mediated by widespread release of GABA and glycine in the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The probable pathway is via projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract to the reticular formation and thence by diffuse projections to the cortex and other areas. Intermittent vagal stimulation has the potentiality of reducing the number and/or the intensity of seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. These results indicate that feasibility studies in humans should be continued and expanded.\r"

Adequate pedigrees, informative genetic markers, and accurate identification of the disease phenotype are necessary. For dominant inheritance, mapping studies can be done in a single large pedigree; the larger the number of affected individuals sampled the better the estimate of recombination between the gene causing the disease and one or more nearby genetic markers. For recessive inheritance, nuclear families with more than one affected sibling provide the best information. The development of many polymorphic DNA markers on the human genome has contributed to the success of mapping unknown genes because, as the genome is now densely covered with markers, the probability is good that at least one marker will be linked to the disease locus in a family that is segregating a disease allele. Most genetic markers now in use depend upon restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), which are either the result of single-base-pair substitution or the presence of a variable number of tandemly repeated oligonucleotide units at a locus (VNTRs). RFLPs can be recognized by digesting DNA with restriction enzymes and separating the fragments by size on an electrophoretic gel. VNTRs can vary widely among individuals, and they provide more linkage information than single-site polymorphic markers because family members are more likely to be heterozygous. Genetic maps of each chromosome, constructed from linkage data relating marker loci to one another in normal reference families, permit rational choices of markers for disease-mapping studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Further elaboration of the classification of seizures into those localized to the six-layered isocortex and those whose elaboration involves regions of the brain involved with consciousness and memory has provided the basic focus for the burgeoning subspecialty of epilepsy surgery. It is increasingly apparent that the etiology of a seizure disorder is of at least equal or of greater significance than the nature of the seizures it spawns and is the product not only of localization in the nervous system but also of causative factors with implications reaching into areas of genetics, higher cortical function, and intelligence. The prognosis concerning the outcome of the epilepsy under consideration is based on all of these facets. This pathophysiological substratum, of which the seizure is only the presenting symptom, constitutes the epilepsy or epileptic syndrome on which the formulation of a rational treatment plan is based.\r"

Temporal lobe epilepsy may follow perinatal injury and febrile convulsions, may be progressive, and frequently becomes refractory to standard antiepileptic therapy. The neurobiology that underlies these features of temporal lobe epilepsy is not known. Recent studies in experimental models have provided new insights that may help clarify the relationship of seizures, hippocampal sclerosis, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Observations from the study of the hippocampus with kainic acid-induced lesions, the kindling model, and other experimental models of epilepsy have demonstrated that seizures induce structural and electrophysiologic alterations in hippocampal pathways that may lead to increased excitability and could play a role in the development and progression of temporal lobe epilepsy. These alterations include mossy fiber synaptic reorganization, induction of NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission, and progressive hippocampal neuronal loss induced by brief kindled seizures. Some of the structural alterations induced by kindling have also been observed in the human epileptic temporal lobe, raising the possibility that mechanisms operative in kindling may play a role in the pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis and in the syndrome of human temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is probably the most common symptomatic pathologic entity--alone or mixed with other pathologic features--for seizures of temporal lobe origin. The pathophysiology of MTS, including any genetic influence, needs clarification. A characteristic ictal expression for seizures of MTS origin appears not to exist. The majority of patients (78%) with postresection MTS who are seizure-free have tightly localized interictal abnormalities restricted to F7/F8, Sp1/Sp2, T3/T4, and T5/T6 more than 96% of the time. MRI abnormalities may be seen in 55% of patients with MTS if both \"hard\" and \"soft\" criteria are used or in 20% when only \"hard\" criteria are used. The neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with MTS, which includes intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), may prove to be increasingly useful in identifying patterns of cognitive deficit that correlate with enhancement of both lateralizing and localizing preoperative information.\r"

  ".W": "Epilepsy complicates severe head trauma. Development of persistent seizures appears to correlate with the extent of trauma. Although early reports suggested that prophylactic administration of antiepileptic drugs would prevent epileptogenesis, controlled studies have failed to corroborate this assumption. Head trauma initiates a sequence of responses that includes altered blood flow and vasoregulation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, increases in intracranial pressure, focal or diffuse ischemia, hemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis, and disruption of fiber tracts. The presence of an intracranial hematoma has a robust association with the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. Extravasation of blood is followed by hemolysis and deposition of heme-containing compounds into the neuropil, initiating a sequence of univalent redox reactions and generating various free radical species, including superoxides, hydroxyl radicals, peroxides, and perferryl ions. Free radicals initiate peroxidation reactions by hydrogen abstraction from methylene groups adjacent to double bonds of fatty acids and lipids within cellular membranes. Intrinsic enzymatic mechanisms for control of free radical reactions include activation of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Steroids, proteins, and tocopherol also terminate peroxidative reactions. Tocopherol and selenium are effective in preventing tissue injury initiated by ferrous chloride and heme compounds. Treatment strategies for prevention or prophylaxis of post-traumatic epilepsy must await absolute knowledge of mechanisms. Antioxidants and chelators may be useful, given the speculation that peroxidative reactions may be an important component of brain injury responses. However, potential treatment strategies involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, and barbiturates need further scientific assessment.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Endorphin has a role in the regulation of the normal menstrual cycle and possibly in the onset of puberty. We have reviewed the evidence pointing to an alteration in this neuropeptide that may contribute to the pathogenesis of various reproductive dysfunctions. Elevated or high levels of beta-endorphin have been associated with exercise-associated amenorrhea, stress-associated amenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Depressed or low levels of beta-endorphin have been associated with PMS and menopause. Alterations in the levels of beta-endorphin may change the pulsatile release of GnRH via noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic pathways. We have primarily focused on beta-endorphin as representative of the endogenous opioid peptides, but other opioid peptides may also contribute to the pathogenesis of various types of reproductive dysfunction. Perhaps it will become possible to characterize and hone our understanding of the function of beta-endorphin and the other substances composing the endogenous opioid peptides. A better understanding of their role in physiological as well as pathophysiological processes may allow for the development of rational approaches to the treatment of specific disorders pertaining to reproduction. Many questions remain unanswered. Among the most relevant are: what is the precise mechanism of action by which beta-endorphin exerts its influence on pulsatile GnRH release? Is there a functional relationship between CNS and peripheral (serum) levels of beta-endorphin? Are the detected changes in beta-endorphin levels merely associated, or are they a cause of a particular disorder? Since it took almost 40 years between the time prostaglandins were first discovered and eventual realization of their clinical application, it may take some time before the beta-endorphin story is complete.\r"

Normal women increased their plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentration by 7.3 +/- 0.4 nmol/L (to 239% +/- 15% of basal), but in oophorectomized women DHEA increased by 1.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/L (to 135% +/- 15% of basal). Thus, the acute response in DHEA to insulin infusion in women without ovaries was only 20% of that seen in intact women. The androstenedione response in oophorectomized subjects was 27% of that seen in controls. We conclude that the insulin stimulation of androgen production occurs predominately at an ovarian site.\r"

Hormonal dynamics and timing of uterine bleeding during the antagonists' imposed luteal-follicular transition were compared with spontaneous (1st to 2nd) and recovery (2nd to 3rd) cycles in 10 normally cycling women. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone levels declined (47 +/- 4.3% and 24 +/- 3.0%, respectively) by 24 hours after Nal-Glu injection, which accelerated the ongoing luteolytic process, as evidenced by more rapid declines of serum concentrations of estradiol, P, and ir-inhibin, as compared with the corresponding control cycle. This was accompanied by the prompt (16 +/- 3.2 hours after RU486) onset of a single episode of uterine bleeding, which was advanced by 2 days. Whereas the luteal phase length was foreshortened by 2 days, the subsequent follicular phase duration was prolonged by 2 days with a normal sequence of follicular maturation, LH surge, and luteal function during the recovery cycle. We conclude that the late-luteal sequential administration of antagonists of GnRH and P resulted in acceleration of the ongoing luteolytic and endometriolytic processes without functional alterations of the subsequent cycle.\r"

This mutation has been reported in eight unrelated late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent possessing the human leukocyte antigen-B14,DR1 haplotype. Normally, there are two 21-OH genes; a pseudogene (CYP21A) and a functional gene (CYP21B). The aberrant codon 281 sequence is normally present only in CYP21A. In all of our late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients, hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe specific for this mutation was demonstrated to CYP21A but not to CYP21B. The mutation at codon 281 of CYP21B does not appear to be a ubiquitous genetic marker for 21-OH deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, suggesting that this disorder may demonstrate the same molecular heterogeneity as congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

During this time they undergo surface modifications associated with changes in their functional state. To study their antigenic expression, capacitated and acrosome-reacted sperm were incubated with sera that had previously been tested for antisperm antibodies against fresh washed sperm, as detected by indirect immunobead binding. Forty-eight percent of previously positive and 20% of previously negative sera reacted differently with sperm after an extended time (18 hours) of incubation in serum or after sperm capacitation. These results suggest that current techniques of antisperm antibodies detection be modified to include testing sera after prolonged incubation times with both capacitated as well as fresh sperm.\r"

The assay enables detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, IgA, or IgM, IgG, and IgA--antisperm antibodies in serum, cervical mucus, and seminal plasma samples. The reverse ELISA is more specific and sensitive than conventional ELISA in detecting human antisperm antibodies of different isotypes. Using this assay, statistically significant differences in levels of antibodies between infertile and fertile individuals were demonstrated in sera and in genital tract secretions. Studies with 143 infertile couples revealed that the presence of antibodies in sera was not necessarily reflected in individual's genital tract secretion and vice versa. These data emphasize the importance of detecting antisperm antibodies in sera as well as in genital tract secretions for correct evaluation of sperm immunity.\r"

Semen characteristics were compared between sequential ejaculates (within a period of 1 to 4 hours) of 18 oligozoospermic males (sperm concentration less than 20 X 10(6)/mL and total sperm count less than 40 X 10(6) in the ejaculate) and a control group of 16 normozoospermic men. Whereas the median total number of motile sperm of normozoospermic males significantly decreased from 70 X 10(6) in the first ejaculate to 23 X 10(6) in the second sequential ejaculate, such a decrease was not detected in oligozoospermic males, 3.6 X 10(6) and 3.1 X 10(6), respectively. The percent of normozoospermic and oligozoospermic men who demonstrated a decreased (less than 50%), a comparable (50% to 150%), or an increased (greater than 150%) total motile sperm count in the second ejaculate in comparison with the first ejaculate were 69%, 31%, and 0 versus 39%, 28%, and 33%, respectively. Consequently, pooling of two sequential ejaculates significantly increased the median total number of motile sperm from normozoospermic males by 144% and from oligozoospermic males by 329%, (to 10.2 X 10(6]. We suggest that pooling of two sequential ejaculates from oligozoospermic males is a simple and cost effective method to increase significantly the total number of motile sperm for intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer, or semen cryopreservation.\r"

Stable measures (within the 95% confidence interval at 37 frames) were observed at 4 frames for curvilinear velocity and at 20 frames for linearity. The corresponding figure for mean amplitude of lateral head displacement and beat cross frequency was 8 frames. We conclude that the frame requirements concerning measures for curvilinear velocity/linearity and mean amplitude of lateral head displacement/beat cross frequency should be 20 and 8, respectively. Thus, 20 consecutive frames to analyze will suffice.\r"

Cocaine hydrochloride (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg) was administered daily subcutaneously for 5 days to New Zealand White female rabbits before superovulation. On the last day of cocaine administration, animals were given human chorionic gonadotropin intravenously, and laparotomy was performed 6 to 8 hours later. During laparotomy, ovaries were removed, the number of follicles recorded, oocytes retrieved, and FF was obtained. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was then performed on the oocytes and the rate of cleavage observed. For all cocaine dosage groups, no differences were observed in the number of follicles present, number of oocytes retrieved, or IVF and cleavage rates. Cocaine did, however, decrease periovulatory serum P, and FF P, whereas FF estradiol concentrations increased. This suggests that short-term cocaine exposure affects the follicular steroid milieu, possibly by delaying granulosa cell luteinization.\r"

The power to detect susceptibility genes is dependent on the risks in relatives and the distance of genetic markers from the susceptibility genes. For insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the best-fitting risk models are those with a single major locus with residual polygenic factors. The major locus effect is likely represented by genes in the HLA complex, because specific genotypes have been found to affect IDDM risk significantly. Thus, mapping the remaining polygenic IDDM susceptibility factors--each of small effect--is a difficult and long task. For non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the likely risk models result in few genes with moderate effect. Models of NIDDM have significant residual polygenic variation remaining, reflecting the importance of multiple loci with small effect, environmental effects, or genetic heterogeneity; however, the prospects for mapping genes that provide at least moderate susceptibility for NIDDM now appear promising.\r"

We therefore examined the effects of glucagonlike peptide I-(7-36)-amide (truncated GLP-I) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) on insulin and glucagon release from isolated perfused pancreases of diabetic rats (12-14 wk of age, mean +/- SE fasting plasma glucose 8.9 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 25) after an injection of 90 mg/kg streptozocin on the 2nd day after birth and compared the results with those of nondiabetic control rats. In diabetic rats, the infusion of 1 nM GLP-I or GIP in perfusates with varying glucose concentrations (2.8, 5.6, 8.3, 11.1, or 22.2 mM) caused a nearly equal degree of insulin stimulation from a similar basal insulin level. Meanwhile, basal and GLP-I- or GIP-stimulated insulin release increased in correlation with the ambient glucose concentration in nondiabetic rats. The degree of stimulation of insulin release at glucose concentrations of 5.6 mM in diabetic rats was approximately 33% that of nondiabetic rats. The stimulation potency was the same between GLP-I and GIP. The insulin treatment for diabetic rats (5 U/kg NPH insulin at 0900 and 2100 for 6 days) brought only a slight improvement in the glucose dependency of GLP-I-stimulated insulin release. The effects of GLP-I and GIP on glucagon release were completely opposite. GLP-I suppressed release; GIP stimulated it. In diabetic rats, the degree of suppression by GLP-I and stimulation by GIP were almost the same with similar basal glucagon levels in the perfusate with varying glucose concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vanadate treatment induced a fall in fed and fasted plasma glucose and insulin levels and improved tolerance to oral glucose; the stimulated glucose area was decreased by 65%, and an early peak of insulin secretion was restored. During an intravenous glucose tolerance test, the glucose disappearance rate was twofold higher in vanadate-treated mice, and the reappearance of a significant insulin response was also observed. Moreover, vanadate produced a twofold increase in hepatic glycogen content and prevented the exhaustion of pancreatic insulin stores. The hypoglycemic response to exogenous insulin was similar in control and treated mice. In vitro experiments showed that basal glucose oxidation by hemidiaphragms was 32% higher in vanadate-treated mice than in controls, although stimulation by insulin was similar in both groups. In conclusion, oral vanadate caused a marked and sustained improvement of glucose homeostasis in diabetic insulin-resistant mice by exerting an insulinlike effect on peripheral tissues and apparently preventing the exhaustion of pancreatic insulin stores.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that short-term angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril can reduce urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) after exercise in normotensive diabetic patients with early-stage nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this effect of ACE inhibition was due to a systemic hypotensive action or a specific action at the intrarenal level. Thus, we compared the acute effects of captopril and the Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine on exercise-induced UAER in normotensive (blood pressure less than 165/95 mmHg) diabetic patients who were normoalbuminuric or microalbuminuric at rest (stage 2 or 3 of diabetic nephropathy). Twenty-five stage 2 diabetic nephropathy patients, 39 stage 3 diabetic nephropathy patients, and 12 nondiabetic subjects performed five submaximal cycloergometric exercises (90% of theoretical heart rate) on nonconsecutive days. The first two exercises were performed in basal conditions; the next three exercises were performed 24 h after administration of captopril (25 mg twice daily) or nifedipine AR (20 mg twice daily) or placebo (1 tablet twice daily) according to a randomized double-blind crossover trial. After placebo, blood pressure and UAER did not change at rest or 1 h after exercise. After captopril, blood pressure at rest and during exercise was similar to that observed after placebo. UAER at rest was not modified, whereas 1 h after exercise, it was significantly decreased both in stage 2 and stage 3 diabetic nephropathy patients (P less than 0.001). After nifedipine, blood pressure decreased significantly at rest and during exercise in respect to placebo and captopril. UAER at rest did not change significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an earlier study, we described the presence of a retroendocytotic pathway for insulin in a cultured kidney epithelial cell line. Derived from the opossum kidney (OK), these cells possess many features of proximal tubule epithelium, which is the major site of kidney insulin metabolism. We studied the interaction between the retroendocytotic and the degradative pathways with bacitracin as a pharmacological probe. Monolayers of OK cells were loaded with 125I-labeled insulin over 30 min, acid washed to remove membrane-bound insulin, then incubated in fresh medium for 60 min while the release of intracellular radioactivity was monitored. In experiments carried out in the presence of bacitracin (2 mM), there was a two-thirds increase in intracellular radioactivity at the end of the loading phase. Measurements made during the subsequent release phase showed that bacitracin reduced the release of degradation products. Thus, although controls released 72.1 +/- 8.1% of the internalized radioactivity as trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble products, bacitracin-treated cells released 59.2 +/- 9.4% (P less than 0.02). In contrast, release of TCA-precipitable insulin increased from 15.2 +/- 4.6% in controls to 25.8 +/- 3.7% in bacitracin-treated cells (P less than 0.01). In separate experiments analyzed by gel-exclusion chromatography, 6.4 +/- 0.6% of radioactivity released from preloaded control cells into medium over 60 min was insulin sized compared to 29.7 +/- 1.4% in bacitracin-treated cells. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that 61.5 +/- 3.5% of this insulin-sized material released from control cells preloaded with A14-insulin eluted as intact insulin and the remainder as unidentified intermediate degradation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is consistent with the lack of enhancement of stable products of lipid peroxidation (measured by the thiobarbituric acid assay) in the lenses of galactosemic rats. This does not imply that oxidative stress plays no role in galactosemic cataract formation (indeed, we find that galactosemic lens homogenates contain increased amounts of an Fe2+ oxidant, possibly a peroxide), but rather that BHT- and BHA-inhibitable lipid peroxidation specifically has no role to play. In instances where drugs appear to inhibit galactosemic cataract formation, other effects caused by the drugs, e.g., inhibition of feeding or induction of general detoxification pathways, must be considered.\r"

We report a procedure for the long-term cultivation of pancreatic endocrine cells to study the relationship between ion channels and insulin secretion. Using thimerosal to suppress fibroblastoid cell proliferation and a preliminary 2-day cell exposure to alternating normal (5.6 mM) and high (16.7 mM) glucose levels, we observed a significant secretory responsiveness of the cells to a glucose challenge for at least 4 wk in culture. Cells also responded to glucose or other secretagogues, such as quinine and the sulfonylurea glyburide, with membrane voltage oscillations. In the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique, a 65-pS-conductance K+ channel was observed, which was inhibited by glucose, quinine, and glyburide. In the inside-out configuration, the activity of this channel was suppressed by ATP applied to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. A K+ channel with a conductance of 200 pS was also observed, which was activated by intracellular Ca2+. A 13-pS-conductance glucose-insensitive K+ channel was present in both cell-attached and inside-out patch recordings. Even after 3 wk, the characteristics of these currents and channels were comparable to those reported by other investigators with freshly dissociated or short-term-cultured beta-cells from neonatal and adult rats and adult mice. Therefore, the neonatal rat endocrine cell culture characterized herein provides an improved model for long-term investigations combining secretion and electrophysiological studies.\r"

  ".W": "The absorption mechanism of insulin administered in the peritoneal cavity (IP) is of current interest because of the near availability of implantable insulin-infusion devices for the treatment of diabetes. To determine the fraction of insulin absorbed by the portal circulation after IP administration, a novel nonisotopic method is described. Conscious fasting diabetic dogs were studied at normoglycemia via the euglycemic insulin-clamp method. Posthepatic appearance of insulin and C-peptide were measured in peripheral blood during IP or intravenous (IV) equimolar infusion of insulin and C-peptide at two sequential 3-h infusion rates of 3.2 and 12.8 pmol.kg-1.min-1. Prior studies have shown that 40-60% of portal insulin is extracted at first pass by the liver, whereas C-peptide is not extracted. Thus, the fraction (F) of IP insulin not taken up by liver at first pass and consequently the fraction absorbed by the portal circulation can be derived from insulin (I) and C-peptide (C) plasma concentration values at steady state with a monocompartmental model where F = (IIP/IIV)(CIV/CIP). The mean +/- SE value of F was 49.7 +/- 8.8%. Glucose disappearance rates were lower with IP than IV infusion but similar when peripheral insulin levels were matched. We conclude that IP insulin is almost entirely absorbed by the portal circulation and induces lower glucose disappearance rates than IV insulin because of lower peripheral circulating insulin levels. Whether these properties make the IP route a more appropriate route for insulin therapy than the subcutaneous or IV routes remains to be established.\r"

Enhanced learning previously reported in simple passive avoidance tasks appears to be due to increased foot shock sensitivity. Diabetic mice show a marked memory retention deficit after learning an active avoidance T-maze task. This retention deficit was reversed by a single injection of insulin, suggesting that it may be related to hyperglycemia per se. Diabetic mice have a shift to the left in the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve for memory retention produced by the acetylcholine agonist arecoline. Based on a preliminary screening, responses to several other pharmacological memory enhancers are probably altered in diabetic mice. These studies suggest that this mouse model of diabetes mellitus demonstrates a deficit in memory retention and retrieval similar to that seen in humans with diabetes mellitus.\r"

Diabetes was induced with a single injection of 37.5 mg/kg streptozocin, and the rats exhibited hyperglycemia in the fed state with normal insulin levels. Treatment of nondiabetic animals with 100 mg/kg SDZ 51641 given orally significantly decreased serum glucose and ketone levels within 4 h without affecting insulin levels. Nonesterified fatty acids increased more than twofold during the same period. Its effect on ketone and fatty acid levels suggests that SDZ 51641 acts as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation. Diabetic rats treated with SDZ 51641 exhibited a significant acute hypoglycemic response, which was more pronounced after 3 days of treatment. The compound also significantly decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels 27 and 53%, respectively. When endogenous hepatic glucose production was assessed in nondiabetic and diabetic animals via continuous infusion of [3-3H]glucose, we found that hepatic glucose production was elevated 43% in diabetic compared with control animals. When diabetic rats were treated with 100 mg/kg SDZ 51641, hepatic glucose production decreased to normal levels within 6 h. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies indicated that SDZ 51641 had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose utilization. Measurement of [1-14C]oleate oxidation in isolated hepatocytes demonstrated that SDZ 51641 inhibited long-chain fatty acid oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. The compound was ineffective at inhibiting long-chain fatty acid oxidation in epitrochlearis or soleus muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the in vitro effects of CP 68722, a novel antidiabetic agent, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CP 68722 stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of insulin. At least 30 min of incubation were required for stimulation of uptake. This effect increased over 5 h and was sustained up to 72 h. The stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by CP 68722 could be inhibited approximately 60% by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Half-maximal and maximal responses to CP 68722 at 72 h of incubation were observed at 10 and 100 microM of drug, respectively, with a threefold stimulation of uptake at 100 microM approximating the maximal response of these cells to acute insulin stimulation. CP 68722 was able to overcome insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone in 3T3-L1 cells. The effect of drug, like that of insulin, was primarily to increase the Vmax of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. The stimulation of uptake by CP 68722 or insulin could be prevented by incubating the cells at 10 degrees C, a temperature that impedes translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane. Therefore, it appears that CP 68722, like insulin, stimulates glucose uptake by a mechanism that involves translocation of intracellular glucose transporters to the plasma membrane and de novo protein synthesis. We compared the effect of CP 68722 with the sulfonylureas, the primary drugs used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). CP 68722 was a more potent and effective stimulator of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells than either first- or second-generation sulfonylureas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that the etiology of the complications of diabetes involves oxidative stress, perhaps as a result of hyperglycemia. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that glucose, under physiological conditions, produces oxidants that possess reactivity similar to the hydroxyl free radical. These oxidants hydroxylate benzoic acid, fragment protein, and induce peroxidation in phosphatidylcholine liposomes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) when LDL is incubated with hyperglycemic levels of glucose in vitro. These reactions are accelerated by transition metals and inhibited by a metal-chelating agent. The atherosclerotic potential of LDL in diabetes mellitus is often discussed in terms of protein glycosylation, which may affect cellular interactions. Our studies demonstrate, however, that peroxidative reactions also accompany LDL glycosylation in vitro. Peroxidative modification of LDL has also been implicated in LDL atherogenicity. Our studies indicate that glycosylation and peroxidation occur concomitantly in LDL modified by glucose in vitro and may both contribute to the behavioral changes of this lipoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise training has been shown to enhance the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in responsive tissues. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of exercise training on the levels of the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (IRGT) in rat skeletal muscle. After 6 wk of voluntary running in exercise-wheel cages, male Sprague-Dawley rats were rested for approximately 27 h and fasted overnight before removal of plantaris and soleus muscles. The concentration of glucose transporters per unit of muscle protein or DNA was quantitated by immunoblotting with an anti-IRGT polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide. The IRGT protein was increased by 60% (141 +/- 14 vs. 229 +/- 24 counts/min [cpm]/25 micrograms protein, P less than 0.01) in plantaris muscle from exercise-trained rats compared with controls. Total protein yield, DNA content, and 5'-nucleotidase activity were not different in plantaris muscle from control and exercise-trained rats. In contrast, there was no significant increase in the IRGT protein in soleus muscle after training when data were expressed per unit of muscle protein (292 +/- 22 vs. 346 +/- 16 cpm/25 micrograms protein). These data indicate that the increase in the IRGT in plantaris muscle is a selective response to exercise training that does not reflect an overall increase in muscle protein. The changes in IRGT for these muscles with exercise training parallel changes observed in insulin-mediated glucose uptake. We propose that this increase in the total number of glucose transporters may be a major component of the increase in insulin-mediated glucose uptake that is observed with exercise training.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships among blood pressure, obesity, glucose tolerance, and serum insulin concentration were studied in 2873 Pima Indians aged 18-92 yr (mean 37 yr). Age- and sex-adjusted to the Pima population, the prevalence of hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, or receiving drug treatment) was 7.1% for subjects with normal glucose tolerance compared with 13.0% for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 19.8% for those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (P less than 0.001). The prevalence ratio of hypertension was 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.5) for IGT and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.2) for NIDDM compared with normal glucose tolerance, controlled for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). In logistic regression analysis, hypertension was positively related to age, male sex, BMI, glucose tolerance, and fasting but not 2-h postload serum insulin concentration. Among subjects not taking antihypertensive drugs, however, neither fasting nor 2-h postload serum insulin was significantly related to hypertension. Furthermore, in 2033 subjects receiving neither antihypertensive nor antidiabetic drugs, blood pressure was not significantly correlated to fasting insulin concentration, and 2-h postload serum insulin was negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, insulin is not significantly related to blood pressure in Pima Indians not receiving antihypertensive drugs. Higher insulin concentrations in drug-treated hypertensive patients might result from the treatment rather than contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Thus, these data do not support a major role for insulin in determining the occurrence of hypertension or regulation of blood pressure in Pima Indians.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the biochemical mechanisms by which hyperglycemia produces insulin secretory abnormalities, we studied isolated islets from control rats and rats infused for 48 h with a 50% glucose solution. To preserve the effects of in vivo hyperglycemia during in vitro handling for islet isolation, our standard isolation procedure utilized buffers containing 16.8 mM glucose. Islets from infused rats released similar amounts of insulin in low or high glucose during first incubations at 37 degrees C (92.4 +/- 7.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM, 84.4 +/- 4.1 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM) in contrast with control (uninfused) islets (18.6 +/- 2.8 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM and 109.8 +/- 8.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM glucose) (P less than 0.01). Secretion by islets of glucose-infused rats was lower during 60-min second incubations at 28 mM glucose than in first incubations of the same islets in low glucose (P less than 0.01). This phenomenon is comparable to the paradoxical hypersecretion observed during the first 10-15 min of exposure of glucose-infused pancreas to low-glucose perfusions. Paradoxical secretion in low glucose waned rapidly, so that during second incubations at 37 degrees C, little immunoreactive insulin release occurred at 2.8 mM glucose, despite the persistence of two additional lesions. The glucose-insulin dose-response curves in second incubations showed a leftward shift for glucose-infused islets, with two- to threefold higher secretion at 5.6-8.4 mM glucose than control islets. This is termed sensitization to glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both nondiabetic and diabetic LDL yield spectra characterized by two major bands near 1160 and 1530 cm-1 due to the carotenoid component of lipoproteins. The relative intensity of 1530- and 1160-cm-1 bands, assigned to -C = C- and = C-C = stretchings, respectively, i.e., I1530-I1160 ratio, was plotted against temperature. For nondiabetic control subjects, the plots showed an inflection in the temperature range of 30-39 degrees C, which corresponded to the thermal transition of LDL. This transition was abolished in the LDL of diabetic patients (P less than 0.001), suggesting an altered lipid structure. The transition (30-39 degrees C) was also abolished in the in vitro glycosylated nondiabetic LDL. Lipid analysis did not show any appreciable change between nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic patients. The change in the thermal transition properties of diabetic LDL has been attributed to the organizational change in the LDL protein.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose regulates Ca2+ influx in beta-cells by controlling a rhythmic electrical activity (slow waves with spikes). However, the glucose-sensitive feedback system that triggers repolarization at the end of the slow waves, and thus stops Ca2+ influx, is unknown. Raising extracellular Ca2+ to 10 mM shortened slow waves in mouse beta-cells perifused with medium containing 15 mM glucose and restored slow waves when persistent depolarization and continuous spike activity were induced by 30 mM glucose. The effects of high Ca2+ were reversed or prevented by tolbutamide, whereas 1 mM tetraethylammonium only increased spike amplitude. This suggests that a feedback action of Ca2+ on ATP-sensitive K+ channels rather than on voltage- and Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels may be involved in slow wave generation. Metabolic modulation of this feedback could be central in the regulation of electrical activity and, hence, insulin release.\r"

It is comprised of 22 exons or coding regions that vary in size from 36 to greater than 2500 bp. To a large degree, the introns appear to divide the hINSR gene into segments that encode structural and/or functional elements of the hINSR protein. The exon-intron organization of the hINSR gene provides a clue to the evolutionary history of this gene and suggests that it is a mosaic constructed from protein-coding regions recruited from other genes. Eight mutations in the hINSR gene that result in expression of structurally abnormal proteins have been described. These mutations are associated with insulin resistance and provide insight into the role of the hINSR gene in the development of diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the impact of diabetes and its treatment on plasma free-fatty acid (FFA) and oxidative fuel metabolism during hypoglycemia, we combined indirect calorimetry with [3-3H]glucose during a 4-h low-dose insulin infusion (plasma insulin approximately 2-fold above basal) in six poorly controlled and nine well-controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients and in six healthy subjects. Diabetic subjects received insulin overnight to maintain euglycemia before study. Although free-insulin levels and counterregulatory hormone responses were similar, the plasma glucose fall was more pronounced in well-controlled diabetic subjects. In well-controlled diabetic and healthy subjects, the small increment in insulin rapidly suppressed plasma FFA and fat oxidation by approximately 50% and stimulated carbohydrate oxidation by approximately 80%. In contrast, plasma FFA levels did not fall in poorly controlled diabetic subjects, and glucose oxidation was not stimulated. To determine whether this resistance to the antilipolytic effect of insulin occurs in the absence of hypoglycemic counterregulation, we used a sequential low-dose euglycemic insulin clamp (0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 mU.kg-1.min-1). In healthy subjects, plasma FFA was nearly maximally suppressed at the lowest insulin dose. In contrast, plasma FFA remained persistently elevated in poorly controlled diabetic subjects at each insulin dose. However, the insulin dose-response curve for suppression of plasma FFA was near normal in well-controlled subjects. We conclude that poorly controlled IDDM diabetic patients are resistant to the antilipolytic effects of insulin and show impaired stimulation of glucose oxidation during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Amelioration of these defects in well-controlled patients may be another factor contributing to the higher risk of hypoglycemia during intensified insulin therapy.\r"

To address this question, three groups of dogs were studied: one group in which pancreatic venous drainage was transected and reanastomosed (portal insulin delivery), one in which the pancreatic drainage was transected and anastomosed to the inferior vena cava (peripheral insulin delivery), and one that received only a sham operation. Plasma insulin was greater (P less than 0.05) during peripheral insulin delivery than in either the portal or sham groups, respectively, before and after meal ingestion. On the other hand, C-peptide concentrations did not differ between groups, resulting in a higher (P less than 0.001) insulin to C-peptide ratio in the peripheral group. This indicated that the hyperinsulinemia in the peripheral group was due to decreased insulin clearance rather than increased insulin secretion. Isotopically determined splanchnic uptake of ingested glucose, postprandial suppression of hepatic glucose release, incorporation of CO2 into glucose (a qualitative measure of gluconeogenesis), and total-body glucose uptake were virtually identical in all groups. Similarly, plasma lipid, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate concentrations did not differ between groups. Our data indicate that, despite differences in systemic insulin concentration, portal and peripheral insulin delivery comparably regulate hepatic and extrahepatic carbohydrate metabolism after meal ingestion.\r"

The metabolic fate of glucose and suppression of fat oxidation may differ, however, when glucose uptake is stimulated primarily by insulin or hyperglycemia. To address this issue, three hyperinsulinemic glucose-clamp studies were performed in combination with indirect calorimetry in seven nonobese subjects with NIDDM. In the first two experiments, when glucose uptake was matched at approximately 8 mg.kg-1 fat-free mass (FFM).min-1 with primarily hyperinsulinemia (1350 +/- 445 pM) or hyperglycemia (20.8 +/- 1.8 mM), identical rates of glucose oxidation (3.21 +/- 0.29 and 3.10 +/- 0.23 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, NS) and nonoxidative glucose metabolism (5.19 +/- 0.75 and 5.46 +/- 0.61 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, NS) were achieved. When glucose uptake was increased further to 11.11 +/- 0.36 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1 with less insulin (625 +/- 70 pM) and hyperglycemia, glucose oxidation (3.85 +/- 0.26 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1) and nonoxidative glucose metabolism (7.26 +/- 0.51 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1) rose significantly (both P less than 0.05 from matched studies at lower rates of glucose uptake). During all glucose-clamp studies, free fatty acids were comparably suppressed by 40-46% (all P less than 0.005 vs. basal values), whereas fat oxidation was suppressed by 70-80% (all P less than 0.005 vs. basal values). A strong negative correlation was observed between rates of glucose and fat oxidation (r = -0.88, P less than 0.001) when all studies were combined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on glucose metabolism was investigated in conscious and unrestrained rats in vivo. Intravenous injection of rat CGRP (5.67 and 0.567 nmol/kg) caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in plasma glucose concentration and a simultaneous dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin level. In contrast, plasma glucagon level was not changed. On the other hand, intravenous infusion of CGRP (46.6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) decreased tolerance to intragastric administration of glucose (IGGTT). Plasma insulin response to IGGTT, however, was not affected by CGRP infusion. Moreover, although intravenous injection of CGRP (5.67 nmol/kg) elicited a significant increase in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, concomitant administration of epinephrine and norepinephrine, inducing a more prominent rise in plasma catecholamines than those induced by CGRP, affected neither plasma glucose nor insulin levels. Finally, plasma insulin levels obtained by simulating CGRP-induced changes in plasma glucose or glucose plus catecholamine levels by infusion of glucose or glucose plus catecholamines were not different from those induced by CGRP injection. These results suggest that CGRP has a hyperglycemic action that is not mediated by sympathetic outflow in conscious rats, and inhibition of insulin secretion, if any, does not play a major role in this hyperglycemic action of CGRP. We have demonstrated specific CGRP receptors linked to adenylate cyclase activation in rat liver plasma membranes; this hyperglycemic effect of CGRP in vivo may be partly due to its direct action on the liver.\r"

Nine healthy men were studied under basal saline-infusion conditions, and during euglycemic and hypoglycemic clamp studies. Insulin was infused at the same rate (1 mU.kg-1.min-1) in both clamp studies. In euglycemic clamp studies, glucose was infused at a rate sufficient to maintain the basal plasma glucose concentration, whereas in hypoglycemic clamp studies, the glucose infusion rate was reduced to maintain the plasma glucose at 3.1 mM. Each study lasted 3 h and included a 30-min baseline period and a subsequent 150-min period in which insulin or glucose was administered. Blood samples for measurement of insulin, glucose, cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon were obtained at 20- to 30-min intervals. A bolus injection of 5-10 mCi [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (2-DFG) was administered 120 min after initiation of the study, and plasma radioactivity and dynamic PET scans were obtained at frequent intervals for the remaining 40-60 min of the study. Cerebral regions of interest were defined, and concentrations of radioactivity were calculated and used in the three-compartment model of 2-DFG distribution described by Sokoloff. Glucose levels were similar during saline-infusion (4.9 +/- 0.1 mM) and euglycemic clamp (4.8 +/- 0.1 mM) studies, whereas the desired degree of mild hypoglycemia was achieved during the hypoglycemic clamp study (3.1 +/- 0.1 mM, P less than 0.05).

  ".U": "91032606\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin was found to provoke rapid increases in diacylglycerol (DAG) content and [3H]glycerol incorporation into DAG and other lipids during incubations of rat hemidiaphragms and soleus muscles. Insulin also rapidly increased phosphatidic acid and total glycerolipid labeling by [3H]glycerol, suggesting that insulin increases DAG production at least partly through stimulation of the de novo pathway. Increased DAG production may activate protein kinase C (PKC) as reported previously in the rat diaphragm. We also observed apparent insulin-induced translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane in the rat soleus muscle. The importance of insulin-induced increases in DAG-PKC signaling in the stimulation of glucose transport in rat diaphragm and soleus muscles was suggested by 1) PKC activators phorbol esters and phospholipase C stimulation of [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake and 2) PKC inhibitors staurosporine and polymixin B inhibition of insulin effects on [3H]-2-DOG uptake. Although phorbol ester was much less effective than insulin in the diaphragm, phospholipase C provoked increases in [3H]-2-DOG uptake that equaled or exceeded those of insulin. In the soleus muscle, phorbol ester, like phospholipase C, was only slightly but not significantly less effective than insulin. Similar variability in effectiveness of phorbol ester has also been noted previously in rat adipocytes (weak) and BC3H1 myocytes (strong), whereas DAG, added exogenously or generated by phospholipase C treatment, stimulates glucose transport to a degree that is quantitatively more comparable to that of insulin in each of the four tissues. Differences in effectiveness of phorbol ester and DAG could not be readily explained by postulating that the latter acts independently of PKC, because DAG provoked the apparent translocation of the enzyme from cytosol to membranes in rat adipocytes, and effects of DAG on [3H]-2-DOG uptake were blocked by inhibitors of PKC in both rat adipocytes and BC3H1 myocytes. Collectively, our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that insulin increases DAG production and PKC activity, and these processes are important in the stimulation of glucose transport in rat skeletal muscle and other tissues.\r"

However, previous attempts to correlate IGF-I levels with PDR have yielded conflicting results. We determined IGF-I levels in a large population-based study of 682 early-onset (diagnosed before 30 yr of age) adult (greater than or equal to 18 yr old) insulin-taking diabetic subjects. PDR was found in 25% of the population. IGF-I levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean serum level of IGF-I was 277 +/- 108 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD). Spearman rank correlations showed statistically significant negative correlations between IGF-I levels and age (r = -0.51, P less than 0.0001), duration of disease (r = -0.36, P less than 0.0001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (r = -0.09, P less than 0.05). There was a significant trend (P less than 0.001) toward decreasing risk of PDR with increasing IGF-I. However, after controlling for duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin, diastolic blood pressure, and the presence of proteinuria and/or creatinine greater than or equal to 265 microM in a multiple logistic regression model, IGF-I was not significantly associated with PDR. These data suggest that IGF-I may not be a risk factor for the development of PDR.\r"

There was a negative correlation between a ratio of proteoglycan/type IV collagen and levels of albuminuria in the diabetic mice. No correlation was noted with laminin. We also examined the effects of inhibiting the synthesis of thromboxane, a potent vasoconstrictor, on the steady-state levels of type IV collagen in the diabetic mice. Inhibition of thromboxane stopped the progression of albuminuria and prevented an increase in type IV collagen mRNA levels. We conclude that basement membrane thickening in diabetes, a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy, is partly a consequence of an unbalanced increase in the production of type IV collagen. The relative decrease in proteoglycan production may contribute to chronic albuminuria.\r"

  ".W": "The reduced postabsorptive rates of systemic glucose clearance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are thought to be the consequence of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Although the peripheral tissues involved have not been identified, it is generally assumed to be primarily muscle, the major site of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. To test this hypothesis, we measured postabsorptive systemic and forearm glucose utilization and clearance in 15 volunteers with NIDDM and 15 age- and weight-matched nondiabetic volunteers. Although systemic glucose utilization was increased in NIDDM subjects (14.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.001), systemic glucose clearance was reduced 1.40 +/- 0.06 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.05 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Although forearm glucose utilization was increased in NIDDM subjects (0.663 +/- 0.058 vs. 0.411 +/- 0.019 mumol.dl-1.min-1, P less than 0.001), forearm glucose dl-1 clearance was reduced (0.628 +/- 0.044 vs. 0.774 +/- 0.037 ml.L-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). However, extrapolation of forearm data to total-body muscle indicated that impaired clearance reduced muscle glucose disposal by only 61 +/- 21 mumol/min, whereas impaired systemic clearance reduced systemic glucose disposal by 662 +/- 82 mumol/min. Thus, impaired muscle glucose clearance accounted for less than 10% of the reduced systemic glucose clearance in NIDDM subjects. Therefore, we conclude that muscle insulin resistance plays only a minor role in the reduced systemic glucose clearance found in NIDDM in the postabsorptive state and propose that reduced brain glucose clearance is largely responsible.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are resistant to insulin. However, the contribution of hepatic and extrahepatic tissues to insulin resistance remains controversial. The uncertainty may be at least in part due to errors introduced by the unknowing use in previous studies of impure isotopes to measure glucose turnover. To determine hepatic and extrahepatic responses to insulin in the absence of these errors, steady-state glucose turnover was measured simultaneously with [6-3H]- and [6-14C]glucose during sequential 5- and 4-h infusions of insulin at rates of 0.4 and 10 mU.kg-1.min-1 in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. At low insulin concentrations, [6-3H]- and [6-14C]glucose gave similar estimates of glucose turnover. Hepatic glucose release was equal to but not below zero in the nondiabetic subjects, but persistent glucose release (P less than 0.001) and decreased glucose uptake (P less than 0.001) was observed in the diabetic patients. At high insulin concentrations, both isotopes underestimated glucose turnover during the 1st h after initiation of the high-dose insulin infusion. More time (P less than 0.05) was required to reachieve steady state in NIDDM than nondiabetic subjects. At steady state, [6-3H]- but not [6-14C]glucose systematically underestimated (P less than 0.05) glucose turnover in both groups due to the presence of a tritiated nonglucose contaminant. The percentage of radioactivity in plasma due to tritiated contaminants was linearly related to turnover.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was aimed at developing a rat model in which these pathogenic factors might be studied. Male Wistar rats were injected at 2 days of age with 45 or 30 mg/kg streptozocin (STZ) or vehicle (control). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were not significantly different between the two groups between 5 and 8 wk of age. At 8 wk, half of each group was randomly assigned to isocaloric diets high in either fat (59% of calories) or starch (70% of calories). After 1 wk on the diets, 45-mg/kg-STZ-administered fat-fed animals displayed significant fasting hyperglycemia (8.6 +/- 0.2 mM; P less than 0.01), which was exacerbated by the stress of anesthesia and/or cannulation, whereas no changes were observed in any of the other groups before (STZ starch fed, 6.7 +/- 0.1 mM; control fat fed, 6.8 +/- 0.1 mM; control starch fed; 6.4 +/- 0.1 mM) or after anesthesia and/or cannulation. In the 30-mg/kg-STZ animals, fat feeding did not significantly elevate plasma glucose concentration, but a significant hyperglycemic response was seen with anesthesia and/or cannulation. In all STZ groups, substantial impairment of glucose-induced insulin secretion was observed, particularly early-phase insulin secretion. Further studies indicated that STZ animals on a diet conferring normal insulin sensitivity (starch) maintained basal normoglycemia and mildly impaired (i.v.) glucose tolerance despite this gross insulin secretory defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To better understand the metabolic consequences of marked calorie restriction, we performed a randomized prospective trial under metabolic ward conditions. Obese gestationally diabetic women were randomized to control (n = 5) and calorie-restricted (n = 7) groups. All patients consumed an approximately 2400-kcal/day diet during the 1st wk of the study, and at the end of the 1st wk, metabolic features of the two groups were statistically indistinguishable. During the 2nd wk, the control group continued to consume approximately 2400 kcal/day, whereas the calorie-restricted group consumed approximately 1200 kcal/day. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose levels remained unchanged in the control group (6.7 +/- 0.8 mM wk 1 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.8 mM wk 2), although they dropped dramatically in the calorie-restricted group (6.7 +/- 1.0 mM wk 1 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.5 mM wk 2, P less than 0.01). Fasting plasma insulin also declined in the calorie-restricted group (265 +/- 165 pM wk 1 vs. 145 +/- 130 pM wk 2), resulting in a significant change between groups (P less than 0.02). Surprisingly, fasting plasma glucose and glucose tolerance measured by the 3-h oral glucose tolerance test did not change within or between groups. Fasting levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate rose in the calorie-restricted group (290 +/- 240 microM wk 1 vs. 780 +/- 30 microM wk 2) but not in the control group (P less than 0.01). Finally, urine ketones increased significantly (P less than 0.02) in the calorie-restricted group, whereas they remained absent in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Membrane fluidity modulates cell function, and reduced membrane fluidity in cholesterol-enriched platelets is associated with platelet hypersensitivity to agonists, including thrombin. Decreased membrane fluidity of these platelets is attributed to an increased cholesterol-phospholipid molar ratio in platelet membranes. We examined the response of platelets from diabetic subjects to thrombin, platelet membrane fluidity, and platelet cholesterol-phospholipid molar ratio. Twelve poorly controlled diabetic subjects were compared with 12 age- and sex-matched control subjects. In response to a low concentration of thrombin, mean values for release of [14C]serotonin from washed prelabeled platelets were not significantly different between diabetic and control subjects, but in 8 of 12 diabetic subjects, the release response was greater than in their paired control subjects. Mean steady-state fluorescence polarization values in 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene-labeled platelets prepared from diabetic subjects were significantly greater than in control subjects; this indicates a decreased membrane fluidity in platelets from diabetic subjects. Total or very-low-density (VLDL), low-density (LDL), or high-density (HDL2, HDL3) lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in plasma were not significantly different between groups; however, the ratio of VLDL + LDL to HDL2 + HDL3 was significantly greater in diabetic than in control subjects.

Patients were aged 18-50 yr with a duration of diabetes of 10-30 yr. UAE was measured every 4 mo, and supine blood pressure was measured annually. Two hundred five patients completed the study. Five years later, 15 patients had developed persistent microalbuminuria with median UAE greater than 30 mg/24 h for at least 2 yr (group 2), and 190 patients stayed normoalbuminuric (group 1). Although within normal range, initial UAE was significantly elevated in group 2 compared with group 1 (mean 19 mg/24 h [range 15-23 mg/24 h] vs. 11 mg/24 h [10-12], 95% confidence interval [CI], P less than 0.001).

  ".W": "We identified a possible endogenous substrate (pp185) of the insulin-receptor kinase in human adipocytes by treating intact cells with insulin and immunoblotting the cellular extracts with polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody. This 185,000-Mr protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to insulin in both rat and human adipocytes. The time course of pp185 phosphorylation at 37 degrees C was rapid and corresponded closely to insulin-receptor autophosphorylation but preceded insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Unlike many growth factor receptors, including the insulin receptor, pp185 was not adsorbed to wheat-germ agglutinin. We found that pp185 phosphorylation occurred at 12 degrees C and that the phosphoprotein was associated with both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions at this temperature. Furthermore, pp185 phosphorylation was induced to the same extent as insulin by vanadate and hydrogen peroxide, compounds previously shown to mimic the biologic effects of insulin. In addition, dose-response analysis of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, receptor autophosphorylation, and pp185 phosphorylation resulted in ED50 values of 0.3, 12, and 12 ng/ml, respectively. These results demonstrate the magnitude of \"spare\" autophosphorylation and pp185 phosphorylation with respect to glucose transport stimulation in human adipocytes. To determine whether the insulin resistance characteristic of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity is associated with a defect in receptor autophosphorylation and/or endogenous substrate phosphorylation, we estimated the extent of beta-subunit and pp185 phosphorylation in adipocytes from NIDDM, obese, and healthy subjects. Although the efficiency of coupling between receptor activation and pp185 phosphorylation was normal in obesity and NIDDM, the capacity for insulin-receptor autophosphorylation was approximately 50% lower in NIDDM subjects compared with nondiabetic obese or lean subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CGRP also inhibited the in vitro effects of insulin to stimulate hexose uptake in cultured BC3H1 myocytes at all insulin concentrations studied. Amylin is a peptide isolated from amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects, is present in normal beta-cells, and bears a striking homology to CGRP. When synthetic human amylin was infused during clamp studies, it inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose disposal by 56% (96.9 +/- 9.4 vs. 42.4 +/- 5.0 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) and to suppress hepatic glucose output by 64%.

DQW4 (DQBBlank) and DQw9 (DQB3.3) were increased in IDDM patients compared with the control subjects, and DQB1.2, DQB1.9, and DQw7 (DQB3.1) were decreased. Thirty-five (48.6%) IDDM patients had both alleles carrying an aspartic acid at position 57 of the DQ beta-chain (Asp 57), 35 (48.6%) were Asp 57/non-Asp 57 heterozygous, and 2 (2.8%) had non-Asp 57 alleles only. Of 85 control subjects, the respective values for these three genotypes were 49 (57.6%), 29 (34.1%), and 7 (8.2%), respectively. The high frequency of Asp 57 alleles in both IDDM and control subjects contrasts with data for Whites. Therefore, the Asp 57 hypothesis that the presence of an aspartic acid at position 57 of DQ beta-chain provides protection against developing IDDM is not tenable for Japanese IDDM patients. The DRB1 gene, particularly position 57 of the DR beta-chain, may contribute to IDDM susceptibility in Japanese.\r"

The study found that grant support has been useful in enhancing the status of family medicine by aiding research and curriculum development, supporting administrative infrastructure, and fostering other topics specific to individual departments. The flexibility with which departments can seek funds for specific needs makes broad measures of success impractical; however, it appears that funds from this grant program have been reasonably effective in advancing the academic stature of departments of family medicine. It is concluded from the study that the program should be continued and that its inherent flexibility should be preserved.\r"

A representative sample of 207 physicians answered a mailed questionnaire related to continuity of care. Eighty percent of the physicians found the concept of continuity important or very important to the ideology of family practice. There were, however, significant statistical and clinically important discrepancies between ideals and reality. If standards are too ambitious or unrealistic to achieve, they often become counterproductive. Two basic ways to correct this discrepancy are discussed: improving reality by increasing chronological care and lowering the ideals by de-emphasizing comprehensive care. The ideals of continuity of care in family practice were set more than 20 years ago. As the field of family practice matures, more realistic goals may be indicated to prevent individual professional burnout and loss of credibility as a specialty.\r"

The program focused on stress management techniques such as cognitive restructuring, progressive relaxation, breathing exercises, and visual imagery. The 45 experimental subjects were similar to the 49 controls with respect to baseline characteristics. Experimental and control subjects had similar rates of mortality, hospital days, bed-disability days, restricted-activity days, and physician visits during the 12-month follow-up. There were no differences between the two groups in physical or psychosocial function at six months or in levels of stressful life changes, social supports, and self-esteem at six and 12 months. Intervention recipients had better function at 12 months, suggesting a possible benefit of the intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine (DPNB) is a local anesthetic technique for neonatal circumcision which is both effective and consistent with ethical concerns for infant welfare. As such, it should be included in training programs that prepare residents to care for newborns. To assess the current level of DPNB use by residents in a family practice training program and to identify attitudes and other factors that relate to use, a survey was sent to 127 residents in the Department of Family Practice and Community Health, University of Minnesota. Of the 101 respondents, 55% had used DPNB, and 17% could be characterized as high users, employing the technique for over one half of the circumcisions they performed. Residents with comprehensive understanding of the newborn's capacity to feel pain were more likely to be using DPNB than their less well-informed counterparts. Four factors were identified as predicting use: cooperation of nursery staff for the procedure, accessibility of instruction in PNB technique, belief that PNB is effective in reducing infant pain, and likelihood of parents giving consent for PNB. These results suggest strategies which may be implemented by family practice educators who wish to promote the principles and techniques of DPNB.\r"

Starting with a series of studies into the office practice of radiology by family physicians to define need, content, and interpretation skill level, and following a systematic curriculum design process, the authors developed a comprehensive curriculum for teaching office X-ray interpretation to family practice residents. The final curricular prototype consists of: 1) a complete set of curriculum objectives; 2) a written monograph; 3) a set of instructional X-rays; and 4) a set of evaluation films. This research-based curriculum development process may serve as a model for developing other educational components for family practice residency training.\r"

Ambulatory patients making routine visits who were age 65 or older, mentally competent, and not acutely ill were eligible. Fifty-two (91%) of these patients participated by completing a fall history questionnaire and undergoing mobility testing. After the visit, the attending physician estimated how the patient would score on the mobility test. Twelve (23%) of the patients reported falls and seven (13.5%) reported fall injuries in the preceding year. Both fall history and physician estimate of mobility score significantly correlated with the measured mobility score. Only the physician estimate of mobility score, however, had adequate sensitivity (94.4%) and specificity (82.4%) to be clinically useful. This estimate will allow the clinician to selectively apply mobility testing to those patients likely to score poorly.\r"

Because physician attitudes toward caring for elderly patients are often negative, it is important to identify aspects of training that lead to favorable attitudes toward the practice of geriatrics. This study investigated the relationships among past casual experiences, educational experiences, level of training, faculty attitudes, and current resident attitudes. All Louisiana family practice residents (72) and program faculty members (35) were surveyed, with response rates of 69% and 86%, respectively. Residents generally held positive attitudes toward the elderly. Variables associated with positive resident attitudes were the amount of didactic training and faculty attitudes. No differences were found among the attitudes of residents at different levels of training. These findings highlight the importance of cognitive training and role modeling in geriatrics. Educational settings in which training occurs--classrooms, ambulatory care facilities, hospitals, and nursing homes--deserve careful consideration.\r"

Three areas were addressed: 1) user demographics; 2) content analysis of questions; and 3) reasons Free-Net was used instead of the person's own health care provider. An analysis of the initial system done in 1985 revealed that early users of the system were known to be predominantly white male professionals, generally in the 25-35 age range. In comparison to that profile, more of the users in this study were women, but the majority of users continued to be white male professionals. Questions asked can be classified in six categories: diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, medications, laboratory tests, and prevention. The main categories of medical concerns were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, obstetrical, and gynecologic problems. Users tended to use the Free-Net for health information rather than their physician because the traditional means was not always appropriate for the life-style of this population.\r"

The authors embrace the biopsychosocial model as an ideal new paradigm for medicine and propose that the family systems approach provides the best available vehicle for applying the biopsychosocial model to everyday medical practice and research. Such an approach would require major changes in the way health care is delivered and offers both benefits and risks for family physicians to consider. One important change would involve the sharing of physicians' power in a health care system that emphasizes collaboration among individuals, families, and a variety of professionals. Such revolutionary changes should be approached with caution.\r"

Congestive gastropathy was significantly more frequent in patients treated with sclerotherapy (83% vs. 50%, P less than 10(-5)). Sixty-month actuarial proportions of patients free of anemia (in the absence of hematemesis or melena), were 17% with severe, 62% with mild, and 93% without gastropathy (P less than 10(-8].

  ".W": "In the present study of 45 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the frequency and clinical importance of the release of multiple gastrointestinal peptides were assessed prospectively. During an initial evaluation, extent of gastrinoma, clinical symptoms, disease duration, and presence or absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (MEN-I) were assessed. All patients had determinations of fasting plasma gastrin, human pancreatic polypeptide, motilin, neurotensin, and somatostatin; 35 had determinations of insulin and gastrin-releasing peptide and 21 had determinations of glucagon. A plasma elevation of additional peptides besides gastrin was detected in 62%, with 44% having one, 18% having two, and 0% having three additional peptides elevated. Motilin was elevated in 29%, human pancreatic polypeptide in 27%, neurotensin in 20%, and gastrin-releasing peptide in 10%, whereas insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were not elevated in any patient. The presence or absence of elevation of any peptide did not differ in patients with or without MEN-I, with gastrinoma size, with the presence or absence of metastatic disease, or with various clinical symptoms. Patients were assessed yearly for clinical evidence of a secondary symptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumor syndrome with a median follow-up of 146 and 84 months from onset or diagnosis, respectively. Only one patient (2% of patients) developed a second syndrome (rate, 2 patients per 100 patients observed for 10 years). These results demonstrate that the plasma elevation of multiple gastrointestinal peptides is common in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; however, the rate of developing a second symptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumor syndrome is much lower than generally believed. Furthermore, no evidence is found to support the conclusions that the detection of the plasma elevation of these peptides is clinically important in assessing MEN-I status, disease extent, or presence of metastatic disease or that elevated levels of motilin, neurotensin, gastrin-releasing peptide, or human pancreatic peptide are associated with any distinct clinical symptoms. Therefore, we recommend that plasma concentrations of these additional gastrointestinal peptides should not be assessed routinely but rather only if new symptoms develop.\r"

Pepsinogen isozymogens are present in very low concentrations in the blood but can now be demonstrated in serum by a newly developed immunoblotting procedure. This study investigated whether the serum pepsinogen A isozymogen pattern adequately reflects the pepsinogen A phenotype. Serum and gastric mucosal pepsinogen A isozymogen patterns were compared in 72 subjects from the routine endoscopy program. A close correlation was found between the relative intensities of the pepsinogen A isozymogens in the serum and the gastric mucosal patterns. Increasing the pepsinogen A release into the circulation by oral omeprazole did not affect the pepsinogen A patterns in the blood. It is concluded that the serum pepsinogen A pattern reflects the pepsinogen A phenotype in humans. In addition, no preferential release of a pepsinogen A isozymogen into the circulation was observed. Thus, immunoblotting of serum provides a new and reliable tool to study pepsinogen genetics in humans. Because a relationship was previously shown between specific pepsinogen A phenotypes and gastric malignancies in humans, serum pepsinogen A patterns may provide a tool to detect subjects who are at risk of gastric cancers.\r"

Dogs underwent total gastrectomy on postoperative days 9 (n = 5 per group) or day 56 (n = 6 per group). Parietal cells were stained with Luxol fast blue and parietal cell mass determined with computer-assisted histomorphometry. Parietal cell mass averaged 10.68 +/- 0.90 billion in control dogs and correlated significantly with maximal acid output (r = 0.76; P less than 0.01). Vagotomy reduced maximal acid output by 40%-50% (P less than 0.001) but had no significant effect on parietal cell mass (8.99 +/- 1.00 billion). Vagotomy increased serum gastrin concentrations significantly, but antral gastrin cell mass in vagotomized dogs (5.66 +/- 1.00 million) was not significantly different than that in control dogs (4.74 +/- 0.50 million). Thus, vagotomy did not lead to parietal cell hypoplasia or gastrin cell hyperplasia despite profound alterations in parietal cell and gastrin cell function.\r"

Eight patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and referred for proximal gastric vagotomy were studied. 24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin levels were investigated in the same patients on three consecutive occasions: preentry without any treatment; after 4 weeks of administration of 20 mg of omeprazole daily, and 4-6 months after proximal gastric vagotomy. Intragastric acidity was slightly more reduced by omeprazole (94%) than after proximal gastric vagotomy (78%), with no difference found during the day or night with either. Plasma gastrin levels increased slightly more after proximal gastric vagotomy [284% (median, 2120 pmol.h/L; range, 733-2831 pmol.h/L)] than after omeprazole administration [186% (median, 1586 pmol.h/L; range, 495-2573 pmol.h/L)]. There is strong evidence that the increased plasma gastrin concentration following omeprazole treatment is caused by the reduced intragastric acidity. The slight increase in plasma gastrin concentration following proximal gastric vagotomy despite a lesser reduction in intragastric acidity may be the result of additional effects on gastrin release by the vagotomy. Both treatments resulted in a modest increase in plasma levels of gastrin that were far below the gastrin levels observed in achlorhydric patients, e.g., patients with pernicious anemia.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor promotes the growth of and protects gastric mucosa against various ulcerogens, including stress, but little is known about its role in the pathogenesis of stress ulcerations. In this study, Wistar rats with intact and resected salivary glands were exposed to water-immersion and restraint stress. During 2-14 hours of water-immersion restraint stress, the formation of gastric ulcerations increased progressively and the duration of stress was accompanied by a decrease in DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa. Following sialoadenectomy, a significant increase in the number of stress ulcerations and further reduction in DNA synthesis were observed. Exogenous epidermal growth factor and dimethyl prostaglandin E2 significantly reduced the ulcerations in the stressed rats with intact salivary glands, but this reduction was significantly less pronounced after sialoadenectomy. Water-immersion restraint stress also resulted in about 50% reduction in mucosal prostaglandin E2 generation, and the pretreatment with indomethacin, which suppressed prostaglandin E2 by about 90%, almost doubled the number of stress ulcerations and abolished the gastro-protective effect of exogenous epidermal growth factor (but not dimethyl prostaglandin E2) against the stress lesions. An inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity by difluoromethyl ornithine also augmented stress-induced ulcerogenesis and abolished the protective action of epidermal growth factor while the administration of spermine almost completely prevented stress ulcerations in rats both without and with pretreatment with difluoromethylornithine. Water-immersion restraint stress also significantly reduced mucosal content of glutathione. Cysteamine increased tissue glutathione and reduced stress ulcerations but N-ethylmaleimide, an sulfhydryl blocker, decreased mucosal content of glutathione without affecting the stress ulcerations. This study indicates that the stress ulcers are accompanied by the reduction in mucosal synthesis of DNA, prostaglandin, and glutathione and that the presence of salivary glands attenuates the stress ulcerogenesis probably by releasing epidermal growth factor which acts, in part, by enhancing ornithine decarboxylase activity, mucosal growth, and prostaglandin and glutathione formation.\r"

Mean serum salicylate concentrations after these doses of salsalate and aspirin were nearly identical (approximately 15 mg/dL). When the gastroduodenal mucosa was assessed endoscopically 1 hour after the final dose of medication, there was minimal mucosal injury in placebo-treated or salsalate-treated subjects and considerable injury in the stomach and duodenum of aspirin-treated subjects (P less than 0.001, aspirin vs. salsalate or placebo). In both the stomach and duodenum, aspirin lowered mucosal prostaglandin F2a and E2 content by greater than 90% (P less than 0.001), whereas salsalate produced no significant change. Aspirin also lowered plasma prostaglandin F2a concentrations by 58% +/- 6%, whereas salsalate lowered them by only 11% +/- 9% (P less than 0.001). Thus, the nonacetylated salicylate, salsalate, produced much less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than aspirin at equivalent serum salicylate concentrations, possibly because salsalate did not inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

The results were assessed by exploratory laparotomy and compared with the results of other localization techniques. Twelve duodenal gastrinomas were resected from 10 patients. Operative endoscopic transillumination detected 10 of the 12 gastrinomas, a sensitivity of 83%, which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that for either preoperative imaging (25%) or intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation (42%). The sensitivity of operative endoscopic transillumination was a result of the ability to detect focal areas that did not transilluminate on the serosal side of the duodenum, and not the mucosal appearances seen through the endoscope, which were not helpful. Operative endoscopic transillumination detected gastrinomas less than 1 cm in diameter throughout the duodenum. Of the patients in this study, 39% had duodenal gastrinomas, a greater frequency than previously reported. These results indicate that operative endoscopic transillumination is the most sensitive technique yet described for detecting duodenal gastrinomas and should be performed routinely in all patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who undergo exploratory laparotomy for cure.\r"

  ".U": "91032790\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether cholecystokinin secretion is regulated by endogenous somatostatin, somatostatin deficiency was induced in vivo with cysteamine (250 mg/kg body wt, IV) or anti-somatostatin antiserum in anaesthetized rats and in vitro with cysteamine (30 micrograms/mL) in a rat duodenum-incubation system. Cholecystokinin secretion was assessed in vivo by measuring amylase in duodenal perfusates collected at 10-minute intervals for 1 hour and in vitro by a carboxy-terminal radioimmunoassay. Cysteamine induced a marked decrease in duodenal immunoreactive somatostatin both in vivo (50%) and in vitro (60%). The rate of amylase secretion increased from 9.7 +/- 2.1 U (mean +/- SE) to 28.0 +/- 4.8 U at 20 minutes (P less than 0.001). The cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist CR-1392 abolished amylase response for 30 minutes, whereas the more potent antagonists Asperlicin (18.0 mg/kg body wt, IV) and L-364,718 (0.25 mg/kg body wt, IV) caused prolonged blockade. The rate of amylase secretion in gastrectomized animals increased from 7.2 +/- 2.0 U to 15.0 +/- 2.2 U 20 minutes after cysteamine administration (P less than 0.01), indicating that the effect was not due to the presence of gastrin. In vitro, cysteamine caused a nearly fourfold increase in cholecystokinin secretion compared with controls (63.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 15.2 +/- 3.7, respectively; P less than 0.001). In vivo immunoneutralization of circulating somatostatin with a high-affinity and high-capacity antiserum produced no significant change in the rate of amylase secretion. These results suggest that cholecystokinin secretion is tonically inhibited by somatostatin and that this effect is mediated by locally secreted (paracrine) but not by circulating somatostatin.\r"

Opossums were implanted with bipolar electrodes on the sphincter of Oddi and the adjacent duodenum. Cats were not. Experiments were performed in vivo using a propulsion evaluation system to test whether the Sphincter of Oddi was able to pump fluid from the bile duct to the duodenum against pressure gradients. In 5 opossums and 4 cats, choledochoduodenal flow was evaluated during the IV infusion of CCK (20 ng.kg-1.min-1). The opossum sphincter of Oddi moved fluid against duodenal pressure gradients of 6-45 cm H2O. The spike-burst frequency (6.4 +/- 1.7 min-1) was maximal at peak bile duct pressures and decreased as bile duct pressure decreased (4.9 +/- 1.6 min-1; P less than 0.001). Pressure pulses in the bile duct were observed at a frequency that correlated with sphincter of Oddi spike-burst frequency (r = 0.84; P less than 0.001). In cats, choledochoduodenal flow occurred only along a hydrostatic gradient; the sphincter of Oddi never acted as a pump but only as a resistor. Infusion of CCk significantly increased the frequency of sphincter of Oddi contractions in opossums, but the transfer of fluid from bile duct to duodenum was significantly reduced. In cats, the rate of fluid flow from the bile duct to the duodenum during CCK infusion did not differ from control values. Reflux of duodenal fluid into the biliary tree was never observed, even at duodenal pressures as high as 100 cm H2O. In conclusion, in vivo, the sphincter of Oddi is able to pump fluid from the bile duct to the duodenum against a pressure gradient in opossums, but, in cats, choledochoduodenal flow requires a bilioduodenal pressure gradient. The increase in sphincter of Oddi contraction frequency induced by CCK in opossums resulted in a decrease in active transsphincteric flow. Duodenobiliary reflux could not be elicited in opossums and cats under the conditions of these experiments.\r"

Endothelinlike immunoreactivity was detected in all regions (from stomach to colon) of the rat gastrointestinal tract (13-48 fmol/g wet tissue) including the mucosal layer of the ileum and colon (8.4 +/- 2.0 fmol/g wet tissue and 18.4 +/- 2.1 fmol/g wet tissue, respectively, mean +/- SEM; n = 5). Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis of the endothelinlike immunoreactivity in jejunum, ileum, colon, and colon mucosa extracts showed peaks in the positions of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. The presence of endothelin-1 messenger RNA was demonstrated by Northern-blot hybridization in the whole colon and pooled ileal and colonic mucosa, but not in the whole jejunum. Specific binding in the rat gastrointestinal tract was particularly high in the fundus of stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon. In the ileum, many binding sites were found in the circular and longitudinal muscle layers, but few in the mucosal layer. Endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 caused contraction of rat stomach strips, rat colon, and guinea pig ileum. These findings indicate that endothelin is present in the rat gastrointestinal tract, perhaps produced by both vascular endothelial cells and mucosal epithelial cells, and can cause contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Thus, endothelin may have a physiological role in the control of gastrointestinal function.\r"

Using these three in vitro systems (cultured human celiac and rat fetal intestine and cell agglutination), it is shown that several small-molecular-weight amines, mostly the polyamines spermidine and spermine, prevent and reverse K 562 (S) cell agglutination induced by gliadin peptides, whereas they do not prevent cell agglutination induced by concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin. Some of these amines also protected in vitro developing fetal rat intestine and flat celiac mucosa from the damaging effect of gliadin peptides. This protective effect may be related to the trophic activity exerted by amines on the intestine and/or the effect of amines on the functions of intestinal brush border or intracellular membranes involved in the intestinal handling of gliadins.\r"

Considerable recent evidence indicates that increased contractility is present only in a minority of patients and that hypercontractile episodes are not temporally related to abdominal pain. In contrast, altered sensation and motor reflexes in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical distention or acid, is common when appropriately investigated. The vagal and spinal afferent innervation mediates visceral sensation and is involved in multiple reflex loops regulating gastrointestinal effector function, such as motility and secretion. Sensory input can be modulated peripherally at the afferent nerve terminal, at the level of prevertebral ganglia, the spinal cord, and the brainstem. An up-regulation of afferent mechanisms would result both in altered conscious perception of physiological stimuli and in altered motor reflexes. Current evidence is consistent with an alteration in the peripheral functioning of visceral afferents and/or in the central processing of afferent information in the etiology of altered somatovisceral sensation and motor function observed in patients with functional bowel disease.\r"

Rats with surgically defunctioned distal colorectums were used, and mini osmotic pumps were implanted to study the effects of intraluminal and IV administration of epidermal growth factor on colonocyte proliferation. Within 2 weeks of bypass, colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned colorectum has decreased to about one third the rate in normal colorectum or in colorectum proximal to the defunctioning colostomy. Intraluminal epidermal growth factor, infused from the time of operation did not reverse this hypoplasia, whereas IV epidermal growth factor maintained colonocyte proliferation at approximately the normal rate in bypassed colorectum. This model is suitable for testing other putative colonic mitogens for possible intraluminal and systemic effects.\r"

The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique. In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%. Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839). beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively). The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range. The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis. It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting. We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia. The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma.\r"

Previous studies of normal and transgenic mice indicated that the liver fatty acid-binding protein gene is a sensitive marker of enterocytic differentiation. This study shows the use of immunohistochemical methods to examine liver fatty acid-binding protein gene expression in normal human colonic epithelium, colonic villoglandular adenomas, nonmucinous and mucinous adenocarcinomas, and several types of noncolonic epithelial neoplasms. Cells containing liver fatty acid-binding protein were found in normal colonic epithelium, in two thirds of colorectal villoglandular adenomas and nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, and in one third of mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in noncolonic, nonhepatic carcinomas. All liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive colonic adenomas and adenocarcinomas contained patches of immunoreactive cells distributed among histologically identical patches of cells without liver fatty acid-binding protein immunoreactivity. This \"mosaicism\" was also found in metastases from liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive colonic adenocarcinomas. Immunostaining of these liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive tissues for carcinoembryonic antigen did not show a mosaic cellular pattern in its expression. These data suggest that within a given neoplasm, differences exist in the differentiation programs of monoclonally-derived, malignant colonic epithelial cells and that liver fatty acid-binding protein is a useful marker for operationally defining these subpopulations. Liver fatty acid-binding protein is also a potentially useful diagnostic marker for colorectal and hepatic carcinomas.\r"

The pancreatic polypeptide responses to modified sham feeding and gastric instillation of a test meal were first compared with the response to oral ingestion of the same meal. The experiments were repeated under cholinergic (atropine) and cholecystokinin (loxiglumide) blockade. Atropine completely abolished the pancreatic polypeptide response to sham feeding and caused significant reductions after gastric and oral food intake. Loxiglumide, on the other hand, significantly reduced pancreatic polypeptide release to oral food (51% inhibition) without affecting the response to sham feeding. In separate experiments using a duodenal perfusion system, the effects of atropine and loxiglumide on intestinal phase-stimulated pancreatic polypeptide release were examined, and both cholinergic and cholecystokinin blockade induced complete suppression. It was concluded (a) that cholecystokinin is involved in postprandial pancreatic polypeptide response, especially during the intestinal phase stimulation, and (b) that the cholinergic system is crucial and superimposed on cholecystokinin in stimulating pancreatic polypeptide release.\r"
