Progression to complete atrioventricular (AV) block occurred in three patients, and one patient required permanent cardiac pacing. Sustained ventricular tachycardia developed in two patients, and ventricular fibrillation developed in five. During a mean follow-up period of 26 months, four patients died (three of them suddenly). The RBBB disappeared in only one case. Acute ischemic intraHisian RBBB occurred in the setting of massive myocardial infarctions complicated by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and by a high mortality rate during the follow-up period. The RBBB rarely reverted spontaneously, and the His-Purkinje conduction time was frequently normal.\r"

Recordings of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram were obtained at control and during atrial pacing at rates of 80, 100, and 120 beats/min. All patients had recordings analyzed from at least two paced rates. At control, the mean high frequency total duration of the QRS complex (HFTD) was significantly longer in group I versus group II patients (123 +/- 5.6 versus 111 +/- 3.5 msec, p less than 0.05). Although the duration of the QRS signal under 40 microV (D40) was higher in group I versus group II patients (42 +/- 4.7 versus 32.4 +/- 3.5 msec) and the root mean square amplitude of the terminal 40 msec QRS (RMSA) was lower in the group I patients (27 +/- 7.5 versus 38.1 +/- 8.8 microV), these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was no effect of atrial pacing on the measured signal-averaged parameters of HFTD, D40, and RMSA. Although there was a difference between group I and group II at each paced rate analyzed, atrial pacing did not help to further stratify the groups. In patients with coronary artery disease, atrial pacing is not a useful method of stratifying high-risk patients. Changes in serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms from the same patient are not due to heart rate variability.\r"

Forty-seven patients with 55 restenoses were analyzed. All patients with repeat angiography for recurrent ischemia 1 to 12 months post-PTCA documenting restenosis were included. Two orthogonal angiographic views best showing the initial lesion, immediate post-PTCA result, and the restenosis lesion, were selected and matched for angulation and cardiac cycle phase. Individual frames were traced and magnified. Restenosis lesions were similar in morphology to the pre-PTCA lesions in 29 of 55 (53%) and to the post-PTCA lesions in only 25 of 55 (46%) (p = NS). However, when the lesions with residual post-PTCA stenosis of greater than 25% luminal diameter narrowing were excluded from the analysis, the post-PTCA lesion morphology was similar to restenosis morphology in 25 of 30 (83%), whereas pre-PTCA and restenosis morphology was similar in only 15 of 30 (50%) lesions (p less than 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that when the restenosis occurred at the same site as the original lesion (group 1), post-PTCA morphology was significantly better (p = 0.01) in predicting restenosis morphology, 15 of 17 (88%), than was pre-PTCA morphology, 8 of 17 (47%). When the restenosis occurred greater than 5 mm distant from the original site (group 2), there was no significant difference in the association between pre-PTCA versus post-PTCA morphology and restenosis morphology. Thus restenosis morphology is usually dissimilar to the pre-PTCA stenosis morphology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Passive transcatheter coronary arterial perfusion, i.e., autoperfusion, has been introduced for clinical use to ameliorate short episodes of myocardial ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of autoperfusion after prolonged coronary artery occlusion. Accordingly, in 24 anesthetized dogs, either the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 6 hours. The dogs were randomized to a control group subjected to coronary artery occlusion alone (n = 13) or to a group treated with transcatheter autoperfusion (n = 11). The hypoperfused zone, i.e., risk area and infarct size, were measured by autoradiography and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, respectively. The hypoperfused zone was 30 +/- 2% and 29 +/- 2% in the control and treated (NS) groups, respectively. When infarct size was expressed as a percent of the hypoperfused zone, it was 84 +/- 5% in the control group and 25 +/- 9% in the group treated with transcatheter autoperfusion (p less than 0.001), showing a reduction of 70%. In addition, an in vitro study showed pressure-dependent flow during autoperfusion as reflected by close linear relationship between perfusion pressure and flow (Flow = 0.54 X Pressure + 16.16, r = 0.99, n = 16). These data suggest that although passive coronary arterial perfusion for 6 hours after coronary occlusion does not prevent myocardial necrosis, it markedly reduces myocardial infarction in the canine model.\r"

To identify differences during myocardial ischemia, systemic and coronary hemodynamics were measured continuously before and during brief periods of left anterior descending coronary balloon occlusion in 23 patients undergoing single-vessel angioplasty. Data were compared for two matched ischemic periods, one control and one \"drug\" period. In 13 patients, diltiazem, 10 mg (intravenous bolus with continuous 500 mg/min infusion), was given; in 10 patients, nifedipine, 10 mg sublingual, was given and after 15 minutes, ischemia was reinduced. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic and mean arterial pressure (for diltiazem, 108 +/- 15 to 93 +/- 10 mm Hg; and for nifedipine, 117 +/- 20 to 96 +/- 8 mm Hg, both p less than 0.01). Diltiazem significantly reduced heart rate-pressure product (with heart rate unchanged), while both drugs maintained the resting great vein blood flow (for diltiazem, 97 +/- 25 to 91 +/- 34 ml/min; for nifedipine, 115 +/- 49 to 98 +/- 58 ml/min, p = ns) with reduced arterial pressure. Coronary flow during occlusion was unchanged (for control versus diltiazem, 63 +/- 21 versus 59 +/- 14 ml/min; for nifedipine, 66 +/- 33 versus 73 +/- 38 ml/min, both p = ns). Neither drug improved collateral hemodynamics or resistance index during ischemia. Both diltiazem and nifedipine prolonged the time to ischemic ST segment alteration (for diltiazem, 27 +/- 10 to 40 +/- 16 seconds, p less than 0.05; for nifedipine, 24 +/- 14 to 38 +/- 14 seconds, p = ns) during transient coronary occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood samples were taken from 48 stable angina pectoris patients and from a group of 28 matched controls before and immediately after exercise and 8 minutes later. Plasma viscosity, the filterability (through 5 microns diameter pore filters) of whole blood, erythrocytes, and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes (separated by density gradient) were monitored. Alterations in whole blood filterability could be linked only to an impairment in polymorphonuclear cell filterability in those stable angina pectoris patients who reported chest pain and/or whose ST segment depression was greater than or equal to 2 mm.\r"

We estimated LV volume from two diameters by sonomicrometry. Six milliliters of CM was injected into the left main coronary artery. Transmural LV end-diastolic pressure increased from 3.3 +/- 1.1 to 7.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and LV end-diastolic volume index from 40.8 +/- 6.8 to 44.7 +/- 7.4 ml. There was only a minor increase in pericardial pressure. Stroke volume decreased by 31 +/- 7%. There was no change in the intracavitary or transmural diastolic pressure-volume relationship, indicating unchanged LV \"compliance.\" Increased LV filling pressure by CM reflected reduced systolic function.\r"

Additionally, the effect of mechanical, rotational thrombectomy and the additive benefit of the administration of intravascular streptokinase were assessed by means of both procedures. After external forceps crush injury alone, contrast angiograms were generally normal (6 of 14) or showed minimal luminal irregularity (3 of 14), and 5 of 14 had 30% to 50% stenosis. With angioscopy, none appeared normal, and 14 of 14 showed thrombi layered along the wall, as well as intimal flaps, and 6 of 14 had partially occlusive thrombi (p less than 0.001 angiography vs angioscopy). After 2-hour occlusion and injection of thrombin into the injured segment, angiographic total (5 of 14), subtotal (3 of 14), or partial thrombotic occlusions (5 of 14) were created. Angioscopy showed similar results, except that total occlusions were classed as subtotal occlusions. After rotational thrombectomy, most arteries again appeared normal by contrast angiography (6 of 11) but none were angioscopically normal (p less than 0.006). Streptokinase, administered after rotational thrombectomy in seven arteries, normalized one 30% angiographic stenosis; there were no other angiographic changes. Findings with angioscopy were also unchanged. We conclude that in the diagnosis and treatment of intravascular thrombosis, angioscopy is generally more sensitive in the detection of intravascular thrombi, with the exception of total thrombotic occlusions. Angioscopy was uniquely effective in identifying subintimal flaps, which were never identified by angiography. In this model, streptokinase provided little or no additional thrombolytic benefit to mechanical thrombectomy alone.\r"

Energy in the low-frequency range (0.04 to 0.12 Hz) in the standing (tilt) position was used as a quantitative index of sympathetic activity. Twenty-seven male patients, mean age 62 +/- 13 years, were studied 2 to 6 weeks after myocardial infarction. Eight patients received metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily; nine patients received diltiazem, 60 mg three times daily; and 10 patients received nifedipine, 10 mg three times daily. HRV and arterial blood pressure were recorded before and 5 to 7 days after initiation of therapy. None of the drugs had significant effects on the systolic blood pressure, and only nifedipine significantly reduced the diastolic blood pressure. Metoprolol and diltiazem reduced the low-frequency HRV in all patients studied, but nifedipine had no consistent effects. Our results suggest that diltiazem had a depressant effect on sympathetic activity similar to beta-adrenergic blockers. This effect was not observed with nifedipine. The reduction in sympathetic activity by diltiazem may contribute to its therapeutic effects in the post-infarction period.\r"

Ninety-seven had sustained ventricular tachycardia; the remaining 48 patients were survivors of sudden cardiac death. The patients had a mean of 3.7 +/- 1.4 unsuccessful anti-arrhythmic drug trials before initiation of amiodarone. The initial doses of amiodarone averaged 845 +/- 258 mg for the first 2 weeks and 56% of all patients received a type I antiarrhythmic drug in addition to amiodarone during the initial phase of therapy. The average maintenance dose of amiodarone was 410 +/- 187 mg per day. All patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years or until death or withdrawal from therapy. The maximum follow-up was a period of 8 years. Thus, the average duration of amiodarone therapy was 39 +/- 26 months, representing 472 patient years of therapeutic time on amiodarone. The incidence of deaths either caused by a documented ventricular tachyarrhythmia or presumed to result from an arrhythmic cause was 5.5% in the first year and 3.4% in each of the second and third years of follow-up. During the entire period of follow-up, 56 patients died of all causes (38.6% of the study population).

  ".W": "Resting measurements of left ventricular systolic function do not reliably predict exercise capacity in patients with cardiac disease. Therefore left ventricular filling shortly after a myocardial infarction was prospectively studied to determine whether it could predict subsequent exercise time. Consecutive patients with an acute infarction underwent Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography within 36 hours of infarction. The study group was composed of the 26 men who did not have reperfusion, who had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, and who had undergone symptom-limited stress testing during recovery (modified Bruce protocol, 44 +/- 23 days after myocardial infarction). Systolic function was measured by ejection fraction and a wall motion score. Ventricular filling was assessed by the peak transmitral Doppler velocity in early diastole (E), with atrial systole (A), their ratio (A/E), and the percentage of filling from atrial systole. The only parameter of systolic or diastolic function that correlated with exercise time was E (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). This relationship was particularly strong for the 16 subjects taking beta blockers at the time of stress testing (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis showed that only E and beta blocker therapy at the time of stress testing contributed to the model predicting recovery exercise time (R2 = 0.55). In summary, E, measured soon after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, is one factor that predicts exercise capacity during recovery.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the outcome of patients after treatment with high-dose intravenous urokinase (3 million U) 102 patients were prospectively evaluated in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. The first 61 patients received intravenous urokinase as a continuous infusion and the last 41 patients were treated with an initial 1.5 million U intravenous bolus. Sixty-two percent of all patients had patent infarct-related arteries by the time of immediate angiography (median time 2.2 hours), which was performed in all patients. There was no significant difference in patency rates between patients treated with or without an initial intravenous bolus. Twenty-eight (28%) patients developed clinical evidence of recurrent ischemia (death, reocclusion, emergency angioplasty, urgent bypass surgery) during hospitalization, whereas only 7 (7%) developed angiographically documented reocclusion. Of 28 patients who failed to achieve successful reperfusion at the time of immediate catheterization, rescue angioplasty was technically successful in establishing reperfusion in all but 1 patient. No significant improvement in median global left ventricular function was seen between immediate (48%) and follow-up catheterization (48%). Significant bleeding complications were unusual except in 1 patient who experienced an intracranial hemorrhage. Eight (8%) patients died during hospitalization. Therefore, the use of high-dose intravenous urokinase in patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a 62% patency rate, a low incidence of reocclusion and bleeding complications and a high technical success rate with rescue angioplasty at the time of immediate catheterization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A maximal exercise test was performed in 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) before discharge and in 49 age-matched control subjects. The long-term prognosis was assessed after an average follow-up of 7.6 years in AMI patients and 5.8 years in control subjects. The maximal work capacity and systolic blood pressure increase in AMI patients was 59% that of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Seventeen AMI patients had significant ST-segment shifts, 13 with ST depression and 4 with ST elevation. In AMI patients experiencing a cardiac death during follow-up the maximal work capacity and systolic blood pressure increase were significantly lower than in survivors and those who died from noncardiac reasons (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.05), with no difference between these groups in the number of patients with ST-segment shifts. The average maximal work capacity of control subjects was 143 watts. A maximal work capacity half this (less than or equal to 72 watts) predicted long-term mortality in AMI patients (p less than 0.001). In addition a low increase in systolic blood pressure (less than 30 mm Hg) also predicted long-term mortality (p less than 0.005), whereas ST shifts were of no significant value. In this study maximal work capacity turned out to be the best single exercise variable for identifying groups of AMI patients with very low and relative high risk of cardiac death. When all 3 exercise variables were combined, the predischarge maximal exercise test was of great value in identifying AMI patients at low risk for cardiac death (predictive value of a negative test: 95%).\r"

During hospitalization, 1 patient developed recurrent AMI and 8 patients developed recurrent angina after MI associated with ST-segment depression at 60 +/- 42 hours after the dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging; of these, 6 required urgent coronary revascularization. No patient died in-hospital. There were no serious adverse effects during the dipyridamole protocol. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, the best and only statistically significant predictor of in-hospital ischemic cardiac events was the presence of thallium-201 redistribution within the infarct zone (p = 0.0001). Of 20 patients with infarct zone thallium-201 redistribution, 9 (45%) developed in-hospital ischemic cardiac events compared to 0 of 30 patients without infarct zone thallium-201 redistribution (p less than 0.0001). During a follow-up 12 +/- 7 months after discharge, 3 additional patients with infarct zone thallium-201 redistribution developed recurrent AMI or unstable angina, whereas no patient without infarct zone thallium-201 redistribution developed ischemic cardiac events. These data suggest that dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging performed very early after AMI may identify a subgroup of patients at high risk for in-hospital and late ischemic cardiac events. Such patients may benefit from early cardiac catheterization and revascularization. Patients without infarct zone thallium-201 redistribution appear to be at very low risk for in-hospital and late ischemic cardiac events and may be candidates for early discharge.\r"

Recently, increased focal infiltration of inflammatory cells into the adventitia of coronary arteries of patients dying suddenly from CAD and activation of circulating neutrophils in patients with unstable angina have been observed. To characterize the presence of inflammation in \"active\" atherosclerotic lesions, the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in 37 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with unstable angina, 30 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with nonischemic illnesses and 32 patients with stable CAD. CRP levels were significantly elevated (normal less than 0.6 mg/dl) in 90% of the unstable angina group compared to 20% of the coronary care unit group and 13% of the stable angina group. The average CRP values were significantly different (p = 0.001) for the unstable angina group (2.2 +/- 2.9 mg/dl) compared to the coronary care (0.9 +/- 0.7 mg/dl) and stable angina (0.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dl) groups. There was a trend for unstable angina patients with ischemic ST-T-wave abnormalities to have higher CRP values (2.6 +/- 3.4) than those without electrocardiographic changes (1.3 +/- 0.9, p = 0.1). The data demonstrate increased levels of an acute phase reactant in unstable angina. These findings suggest that an inflammatory component in \"active\" angina may contribute to the susceptibility of these patients to vasospasm and thrombosis.\r"

Each patient underwent 4 upright bicycle exercise tests on consecutive days. The first and fourth tests were performed without medication while the second and third tests were preceded by a low and high bolus dose of monosodium glutamate, either 0.8 and 1.5 mg/kg body weight intravenously (10 patients) or 40 and 80 mg/kg orally (10 patients). Comparison of the first and fourth tests revealed good reproducibility of electrocardiographic, hemodynamic and metabolic data. Glutamate increased exercise duration (p less than 0.05) in a dose-related way when given intravenously (59 +/- 14 and 153 +/- 14 seconds) and when given orally (53 +/- 21 and 90 +/- 23 seconds; all data are mean +/- standard error of the mean).

Hemodynamics were not changed by glutamate at rest or at comparable workloads, but at onset of ST-segment depression the heart rate-blood pressure product was increased (p less than 0.05). Glutamate administration induced dose-related 1.5- to 10-fold elevations in plasma glutamate, 15 to 50% decreases in plasma free fatty acids (p less than 0.05) and 5 to 30% increases in plasma alanine contents.

This study explores these changes as applied to the treatment of chronic coronary artery disease. The study population comprised 14,078 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization between 1981 and 1988. In 1981, 1,704 patients underwent a first known cardiac catheterization at Emory University Hospital or Crawford W. Long Hospital and were found to have significant coronary artery disease. Of these patients, 51.7% were treated medically, 44.0% by CABG and 4.3% with PTCA. A similar group comprised 1,719 patients in 1988. Of this group 41.2% were treated medically, 28.5% with CABG and 30.3% with PTCA. The data reveal a much more complex phenomenon than a simple increase in PTCA for the treatment of coronary disease at the expense of CABG. The CABG group aged such that the percent of the CABG population more than 65 years old increased from 26.0% of the total in 1981 to 44.9% of the total in 1988. The percent of patients with ejection fractions less than 50% in the CABG population increased from 24.5% in 1981 to 29.7% in 1988. The PTCA population had less severe disease, was younger and had better left ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Loss of preexcitation after infusion of up to 10 mg/kg of procainamide during sinus rhythm has been reported to correlate with a slow ventricular response during atrial fibrillation and has been proposed as a noninvasive test to establish risk of sudden death in these patients. Others have failed to establish this relation and have questioned the usefulness of the procainamide test. Such conflicting results were hypothesized to be a result of differing dosages and methodology. Consequently, this study tested the effect of incremental doses of procainamide (to a cumulative dose of 1 g) on the anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway and related the reliability of the procainamide test to the dose at which preexcitation was lost. The effect of procainamide on the anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was dose dependent; patients who lost preexcitation had a steeper dose-response curve. Loss of preexcitation by a cumulative dose of 550 mg provided the best balance for sensitivity (60%) and specificity (89%) in identifying patients with preexcited shortest RR greater than 250 ms. Specificity fell steeply after this dosage and higher doses were not useful. The diagnostic accuracy of the procainamide test is critically related to dosage and method of infusion.\r"

The age, gender, type of heart disease, symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar in both groups. Group I patients had a higher overall incidence of syncope. Group I patients received no therapy, while group II patients received antiarrhythmic therapy guided by electropharmacologic testing. At 21 +/- 17 months there was no sustained VT in either group. There were 3 deaths in group I patients, including 1 sudden, 1 nonsudden cardiac and 1 noncardiac death. In group II patients 6 deaths occurred including 4 nonsudden cardiac and 2 noncardiac deaths. In patients with nonsustained VT and coronary artery disease undergoing programmed ventricular stimulation, the incidence of significant arrhythmic events is low in those without therapy with no inducible arrhythmia, and in those with an inducible arrhythmia with therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing.\r"

Upon achievement of optimal hemodynamics, maintenance infusion was begun (mean dose 0.6 micrograms/kg/min). Fenoldopam mesylate (baseline vs maximal effect) decreased systemic vascular resistance by 37% (p less than 0.001), left ventricular filling pressure by 16% (p less than 0.05) and mean arterial pressure by 11% (p less than 0.05), with an associated augmentation in cardiac index and stroke volume index by 27% (p less than 0.001).

Of the 165 patients, 147 were treated with warfarin. A prothrombin time 1.3 to 1.8 times control (range 15 to 20 seconds) was maintained in 134 patients with single valve and 1.8 to 2 times control (range 20 to 25 seconds) in 13 patients with double valve prostheses. The 10-year actuarial event-free incidence from thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications was 84 and 95%, respectively. Of the 8 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy alone, 4 had thromboembolic events. Of the 10 patients on neither warfarin nor antiplatelet therapy, 3 had thromboembolic events. The 10-year actuarial event-free incidence from valve failure was 95%. The 10-year actuarial patient survival was 55%. Thus, the St. Jude valve is a safe and reliable prosthesis with acceptable overall long-term performance in patients given a modest anticoagulation regimen. Patients who receive St. Jude prosthetic valves without anticoagulants have a high incidence of thromboembolic events despite therapy with antiplatelet agents.\r"

The peak filling rate measured in stroke volume counts did not vary with the relative residual volume (HC r = 0.10, difference not significant; normal r = 0.21, difference not significant) and was less than normal in patients with HC (4.27 +/- 0.69 vs 4.72 +/- 1.0; p = 0.58). There was a strong association between the first third filling fraction and the heart rate (HC r = 0.66, p less than 0.001; normal r = 0.71, p less than 0.001), reflecting its dependence on the duration of the first third of diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The object of this study is to document variation in atrial pacemaker rate and P-wave axis, and to clarify the natural history of abnormally slow atrial rhythms in left isomerism. Standard 15-lead electrocardiograms of 50 patients with left isomerism were retrospectively studied. On the average, 9 electrocardiograms covering 7 years for each patient were available. For comparison, atrial rhythms in patients with right isomerism and in those with situs solitus and 5 representative congenital cardiac conditions were studied with the same study protocol. In left isomerism, atrial rhythm with constantly normal P-wave axis was exceptional and the presence of atrial rhythm with abnormal P-wave axis was the rule. The most frequent abnormal mean frontal P-wave axis was between -30 and -90 degrees, recorded in 70%. Slow atrial rates below the second percentile were observed in 50%, either transiently and recurrently (in 40%), or persistently (in 10%), and were associated with junctional escape in 42%. The number of patients with slow atrial rate increased with age. In right isomerism, multiple atrial rhythms were also frequent, but slow atrial rhythms was present in only 4%. Multiple atrial rhythms or bradycardia associated with junctional escape were rare in the group of patients with congenital heart disease and situs solitus. It is concluded that multiplicity and progressive slowing of the atrial rhythm are characteristic in patients with left isomerism.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in parameters of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling flow obtained with Doppler echocardiography during the lower body positive and negative pressure method were analyzed in 15 patients (12 with coronary artery disease and 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy). Lower body pressure was altered at 5 steps (+20, +10, 0, -20 and -40 mm Hg vs atmospheric pressure). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measured with a balloon-tipped catheter was changed proportionally with lower body pressure during the procedures (p less than 0.01). Mean systemic arterial pressure was changed slightly during lower body positive pressure and negative pressure of -40 mm Hg. Heart rate was almost unchanged except at lower body pressure of -40 mm Hg. The peak velocity of LV early diastolic filling flow was changed with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in an almost parallel fashion during the procedures (p less than 0.01). The peak velocity of LV late diastolic filling flow showed smaller changes than that of early diastolic filling flow. Changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated positively with changes in the peak velocity of LV early diastolic filling flow (r = 0.759, p less than 0.01), but not with changes in the peak velocity of LV late diastolic filling flow (r = 0.039, not significant) during lower body negative pressure of -20 mm Hg. These data suggest that left atrial pressure is one of the important determinants of LV early diastolic filling flow in this acute clinical setting and that LV late diastolic filling flow is less sensitive to changes in left atrial pressure than LV early diastolic filling flow.\r"

Between 1960 and 1985 the consumption of bread, potatoes, and edible fats decreased and the consumption of fruits, pastries, nuts, and alcoholic beverages increased in both the aging cohort and in the two independent samples of middle-aged men examined 25 y apart. These changes were accompanied by a substantial decrease in the intake of monounsaturated fat, polysaccharides, and potassium and a substantial increase in animal protein and alcohol. Small changes were observed in the intake of saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary cholesterol, and dietary fiber. Since 1960 some changes in a nutritionally desirable direction were observed but the diet of the Zutphen men in 1985 departs substantially from the guidelines for a healthy diet formulated by The Netherlands Nutrition Council in 1986.\r"

Six adiposity measures (three skinfold indices, three height-weight indices) were derived from measures of height, weight, and eight skinfold thickness measurements. A principal components analysis of these adiposity measures resulted in a unifactorial solution accounting for 85.6% of the total variance. A cross-tabulation analysis with the derived factor scores and a criterion visual inspection rating supported the interpretation that the underlying construct of the factor was adiposity, and that a factor score of greater than 1.5 SD above the mean was a suitable standard for labeling obesity. Utilizing this dichotomy of factor scores as a standard, the differential diagnostic capabilities of four adiposity scales commonly used in identifying obesity was undertaken. Pursuit of this methodology, with the use of additional measures and larger sample sizes, is recommended to ensure the validation of an obesity measure.\r"

Nonsmokers had higher intakes of almost all nutrients than did smokers and the nutrient density of their diet was greater. Energy intake was nonsignificantly higher in nonsmokers. Women in higher social classes had the highest nutrient intakes. Smokers were shorter than nonsmokers and tended to be of lower social class. After maternal height and social class were controlled for, smoking had a significant effect on intake of many micronutrients. Dietary intake was reduced in late pregnancy, particularly in smokers.

We recently developed a method to separate human-milk whey and casein by adjustment of whole human milk to pH 4.3 and addition of calcium followed by ultracentrifugation. In this study we analyzed and evaluated human casein prepared by different methods. We used fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with an anion-exchange column (Mono-Q) and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis techniques to analyze the casein subunit composition. Total casein in human milk, as determined by the Kjeldahl method, varies during lactation; the casein content is approximately 20% of the total protein content in early lactation and 45% in late lactation. We found differences in both glycosylation and phosphorylation patterns of kappa-caseins and beta-caseins from premature and term milk samples.\r"

The arrhythmia model was coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion under anesthesia. Animals were fed commercial stock diet (4% fat wt:wt) supplemented (12% wt:wt) with fat (final diets, 35% energy as fat). Of rats fed the SF diet for 9 and 18 mo, ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred in 71% during occlusion and in 86% on reperfusion. Mortality from VF was 0% after 9 mo on the SF diet but 67% after 18 mo. Dietary crossover to n-3 (tuna-fish oil) or n-6 (sunflower-seed oil) PUFA-supplemented diets at 9 mo reduced arrhythmias (VF incidence less than 30% in occlusion and reperfusion) and mortality (0%). The n-3 PUFAs were most effective. Dietary interventions can be effective even when introduced in mature, high-risk animals and may be of benefit in reducing risk of sudden cardiac death.\r"

  ".W": "Malnutrition in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is common and multifactorial. The possible causes of malnutrition were evaluated by performing studies of energy balance in five clinically stable outpatients with AIDS, six seronegative homosexual control subjects, and five seronegative heterosexual control subjects. The AIDS group was significantly depleted of body cell mass compared with the control subjects but the values did not change significantly over 6 wk. Food intake was normal in the AIDS group whereas intestinal absorptions of the pentose sugar xylose and of the triglyceride triolein were both significantly diminished. The AIDS patients were hypometabolic as compared with the control subjects and with predictions of metabolic rate based on the Harris-Benedict equation. We conclude that short-term energy balance can be maintained in clinically stable patients with AIDS. Hypometabolism is an appropriate metabolic response to the combination of body-cell-mass depletion and nutrient malabsorption.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 134 school children aged 3-9 y, with signs of conjunctival xerosis, from the rural area of the Sakorn Nakhon province in Northeast Thailand were selected for a controlled study on the short-term effect (2 wk) of a single, oral high dose of vitamin A on iron metabolism. After collection of the baseline data, children within villages were randomly assigned to receive the capsules (n = 65) or serve as control subjects (n = 69). Two weeks after supplementation significant increases of retinol, retinol-binding protein, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron, and saturation of transferrin were found in the supplemented group. Ferritin concentrations did not change significantly. These short-term changes completely exclude seasonal effects and change in morbidity. This study provides further evidence of a causal association between vitamin A and iron metabolism. In areas where vitamin A deficiency is endemic, periodic massive vitamin A dose programs can also improve iron status of the population.\r"

Vitamin B-12 values did not vary significantly in either group. The dUST value decreased from 10.4 +/- 4.6% (means +/- SD) pretreatment to 4.5 +/- 4.7% in F group after 2 mo (p less than 0.001). The dUST values had significant negative correlation with plasma and erythrocyte folate concentrations. However, erythrocyte folate had the greatest power to distinguish P group from F group.\r"

Foods differed widely in their effects although the pattern of the effects on both porcine and human enzymes was similar. Extracts of legumes, tomatoes, and orange juice consistently inhibited the conjugase activity. Citrate was also inhibitory to some extent. In contrast, extracts of cereal grain flours, whole egg, milk, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce caused little inhibition. Purified phytohemagglutinins, soybean trypsin inhibitors, and bovine milk folate-binding protein had no effect on the conjugase activity at the concentrations tested. The food substances that inhibited the conjugase activity did not bind the polyglutamyl folate substrate or inhibit intestinal brush border membrane sucrase and alkaline phosphatase. These findings suggest that food composition may influence folate bioavailability by interfering with the intestinal deconjugation of dietary polyglutamyl folates.\r"

Each woman received a placebo and 500 mg calcium from a mixed calcium citrate-malate salt (CCM), from orange juice plus CCM, and from milk after a test breakfast meal to which 59Fe had been added. The test meal contained 238 mg calcium. Whole-body countings of 59Fe were performed before and 30 min and 2 wk after each test meal. Retention of 59Fe was 8.3 +/- 1.1% (means +/- SEM) with placebo, 3.4 +/- 0.78% with milk, 6.0 +/- 0.97% with CCM, and 7.4 +/- 1.7% with CCM plus orange juice. When compared with placebo, milk and CCM significantly lowered iron retention (p less than 0.05) whereas CCM plus orange juice did not. The reduction with milk was greater than that with CCM (p less than 0.05) or CCM plus orange juice (p less than 0.05). The differences in the effects of these calcium sources on 59Fe retention may result from their varied contents of citric and ascorbic acids, known enhancers of iron absorption.\r"

  ".W": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was administered to 10 patients diagnosed as having primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) after liver biopsy. Eight patients were anicteric, and two were icteric cases. One patient was in stage I, seven were in stage II, one in stage I-III, and one in stage III-IV of Scheuer's classification. Six hundred milligrams of UDCA were administered orally after meals three times daily to all of the patients for more than 1 yr. The period of UDCA administration ranged from 6 to 41 months. The major findings are as follows: 1) in six out of seven patients with pruritus, itching disappeared 1 month after administration of UDCA; 2) both serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels began decreasing significantly the first month after the onset of UDCA treatment, and continued decreasing throughout the treatment; 3) GOT and GPT levels also decreased significantly during the administration of UDCA, compared with before-treatment levels; 4) in one icteric patient with portal hypertension, although serum biliary enzyme levels improved after treatment, serum bilirubin level got worse, and the patient died of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. In another icteric case, biliary and bilirubin levels improved slightly after treatment; 5) antimitochondrial antibody titer decreased in four cases, but IgM levels and other immunological parameters were not changed; 6) serum UDCA increased significantly during UDCA treatment; in particular, glyco-UDCA occupied up to 40% of the total bile acid and CDC decreased to 25%; 7) portal inflammation activity decreased in all five patients who had undergone follow-up liver biopsy, more than 1 yr after UDCA administration--bridging fibrosis decreased in three cases; and 8) no side effects were observed in any of the cases. Although large-scale, randomized, controlled, double-blind tests are necessary, it is speculated that the long-term administration of UDCA is a safe and effective treatment for the improvement of biliary enzyme levels and pruritus in anicteric PBC.\r"

The effect of sclerotherapy and of esophageal transection on gastric mucosal blood flow were also investigated. Regional gastric mucosal blood flow in either the antrum or the corpus was significantly decreased in these patients, compared with normal controls. There was also a significant difference in gastric mucosal blood flow between two subgroups of patients, one with gastric mucosal lesions and the other without these lesions. Sclerosing therapy for esophageal varices tended to affect this parameter. Gastric mucosal blood flow had no significant correlation with portal pressure.\r"

Gastric emptying of solids in patients with bulimia nervosa was similar to that in controls (gastric T1/2 131 +/- 15 min vs 119 +/- 7 min; mean +/- SEM). In contrast, patients with anorexia nervosa had overall delayed emptying (182 +/- 31 min; p less than 0.05); six patients had normal emptying of the solid components of the meal and four had markedly delayed emptying. Gastric emptying of liquids was similar in the bulimics and controls (gastric T1/2 48 +/- 5 min and 49 +/- 4 min, respectively), whereas the anorexics tended to have prolonged gastric emptying (65 +/- 11 min, p = NS). There was no correlation between body weight, gastrointestinal symptoms, and gastric emptying in either group. These findings suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms are unreliable indicators of gastric emptying in patients with eating disorders, and that gastric emptying studies should be performed in such patients before treatment with prokinetic agents is considered.\r"

Forty-seven individuals with pancreatic cancer from 18 families were identified from a review of the medical records of all kindreds on file at our Hereditary Cancer Institute. The observed sex ratio, age of onset, histologic type, and survival were comparable to published data on unselected patients. We did not identify any pattern of extra-pancreatic cancer association. A serious limitation of our study is its lack of a population-based case/control design. Whereas our data are primarily descriptive, they do indicate the need to learn more about the role of familial factors in the etiology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is increasing in incidence, and its prognosis is almost uniformly dismal; identification of persons at high risk may improve cancer control.\r"

The crude odds ratio (OR) after cholecystectomy for colon cancer was 2.1 [95% CL (confidence limits) = 1.5; 2.9]. No significant difference in risk between males (OR = 2.0; 95% CL = 1.1; 3.6) and females (OR = 2.1; 95% CL = 1.4; 3.2) was found. A significant inverse relationship was found between the relative risk for colon cancer and sublocalization of the colon cancer, the highest relative risk (RR) found proximal in the colon. A decreasing risk with increasing interval between cholecystectomy and date of diagnosis of colon cancer was found. It is hypothesized that the apparent association between cholecystectomy and colon cancer does not reflect a necessary cause-effect relationship, but is rather an epiphenomenon representing a diminished exposure level to other etiologic factors.\r"

We report here the case of a 65-yr-old man who presented with complaints of weight loss, early satiety, bloating, and swelling and tenderness in his upper thighs. Endoscopy with biopsy revealed invasive, poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. Biopsy of one of the thigh masses displayed the same findings. The patient initially responded well to an investigational protocol with high-dose 5-fluorouracil, with regression of the thigh masses and palliation of his pain.\r"

  ".W": "Pain control using intramuscular analgesia is often unsatisfactory in sickle cell patients. In a pilot study, 15 patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) and one patient with SB thalassemia in vaso-occlusive crisis were treated with the Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) technique using a Pharmacia Deltec Programmable pump (CADD PCA). Age range was 19-50 years (median = 27); there were nine females and seven males. The protocol consisted of 3 days of therapy using a background of continuous infusion meperidine. The starting dose was 20 mg/hr and was escalated to 30 mg/hr. The average amount given was 25.8 mg/hr. One to two boluses of 2.5-5.0 mg/dose (mode = 5.0) were also allowed each hour. In addition, patients number 8 through 16 were given hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 50 mg PO q6h. The number of days in pain prior to study entry (mean +/- SD) was 3.3 +/- 1.6. The number of pain sites per patient was 3.6 +/- 1.2. Using categorical and analog pain scales, patients' pain scores decreased only about 30%. However, most patients were fairly satisfied with the treatment and rated it overall as follows: 1 poor, 1 fair, 3 good, 6 very good, 4 excellent, 1 no comment. Patients number 8 through 16 gave higher ratings probably because a more idealized dosage regimen was being used by that time in the study. There were no adverse effects or major problems noted. It is our impression that PCA, when optimized, will be a safe and effective alternative method for providing patients with sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis pain relief.\r"

Eighteen sickle cell disease patients were enrolled at random. Controls were 19 normal volunteers and seven family members of the patients. The patients showed significantly reduced levels of prealbumin and carotenoids compared with either normals or family members. Levels of carotenoids did not significantly correlate with level of prealbumin, which suggests that the undernutrition was not the only factor contributing to lower levels of carotenoids in these patients.\r"

As there is no information on the transport of this drug by the human placenta, such studies were carried out using the single cotyledon placental perfusion system and human placental vesicles. AZT crossed the placenta readily and bidirectionally. The transfer rate was about 70% that of a freely diffusible reference marker, antipyrine, and was comparable in both directions. There was no evidence of active or carrier-mediated transport and no glucuronidated metabolites of the drug were identified in either maternal or fetal compartments. The authors believe that the drug crosses the placenta by diffusion, consistent with its lipophilicity and transport into various blood cells.\r"

I- released from 125I-T4 was measured by ion-exchange column chromatography. Activity of BAT 5'MDI was markedly elevated in the 3 day fasted group (133 +/- 28 fmol I-/h per mg protein vs. 26 +/- 6.4; p less than 0.05). Kinetic studies using BAT infranatant suggested that fasting-induced activity is associated with a similar change in the Vmax, but no demonstrable change in apparent Km of T4 monodeiodination. T4 replacement during fasting, which normalized both serum T4 and T3 in fed and 3 day fasted groups, did not stop the increase of BAT 5'MDI in the fasted group (p less than 0.01). The data suggest that: (1) the fasting-induced increase in BAT 5'MDI is due mainly to the changes in capacity rather than the affinity of the enzyme, and (2) the fasting-induced increase in BAT 5'MDI is not mediated entirely through changes in serum thyroid hormone concentration.\r"

  ".U": "90119625\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that mercuric chloride (HgCl2) inhibits in vitro vasopressin release from the isolated rat neurohypophysis with maximum inhibition occurring with 0.5 mM HgCl2. Associated with the inhibition of hormone release is an increase in 45Ca+2 uptake, an increase in cytosolic 45Ca+2, and a reduction of 45Ca+2 accumulation by mitochondria in the intact gland. In the present series of studies, the effect of HgCl2 on calmodulin (CM) function in neural tissue preparations is reported. Mercuric chloride (0.5 mM) reduced 45Ca+2 binding to CM purified from bovine neurohypophyses by 20% and inhibited endogenous CM-stimulated Ca,Mg-ATPase activity from rat brain mitochondria in a dose-dependent fashion. Ca,Mg-ATPase activity was inhibited by 50 and 80% with 0.5 and 5.0 mM HgCl2, respectively. CM-stimulation of Ca,Mg-ATPase activity was inhibited by calmidazolium (CMZ) with maximal inhibition seen with 0.1 mM CMZ. Reversibility of the HgCl2 interaction with CM was demonstrated using CM-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDEase) activity from rat brain. HgCl2 inhibited both basal and CM-stimulated PDEase activity in a dose-dependent manner with maximum inhibition occurring with 1.0 mM HgCl2. Preexposure of CM to an inhibitory concentration (1.0 mM) of HgCl2 resulted in no loss of stimulatory PDEase enzyme activity. From these results, we conclude that HgCl2 reversibly interferes with 45Ca+2 binding to CM and also inhibits CM-regulated Ca+2 pumping enzyme systems in the neurohypophysis. The inhibition of vasopressin release from the intact gland in the presence of HgCl2 thus, may be associated with a disruption of calcium in the neurohypophysis.\r"

The curriculum of the 10 week rotation includes patient care in the office and by telephone, nursing home and home visits, tutorials and seminars on primary care and office management topics, and training in the use of microcomputers. A survey of 46 (92%) of the first 50 residents completing the rotation revealed that the content of the rotation was valuable, the rotation substantially influenced career choices, and the rotation helped provide a balanced view of internal medicine practice.\r"

Disturbed oculomotor control occurred in 14 children (44%), most of whom were among those with severe handicap. Ocular morbidity was present in 13 (40%) of 32 children: one had cataracts, two had corneal scars, seven had optic atrophy, and nine had chorioretinal scars. The clinically silent chorioretinal lesions were manifest as coarse hyperpigmented areas between the equator and ora serrata. One child had suffered from acute fulminant retinitis. Twelve of 13 (93%) severely handicapped children had impaired vision, mainly because of cortical blindness. Less affected children had normal vision unless corneal scars were present. Long-term observation of patients with neonatal herpes infections is essential because ocular manifestations are not rare, and recurrences may be more common than previously reported.\r"

The high risk of secondary hemorrhage with potential ocular damage in patients with traumatic hyphema, especially black patients, supports the benefit of hospitalization and the administration of aminocaproic acid.\r"

Eight of the nine eyes had previously failed conventional vitreous surgery with gas tamponade and laser photocoagulation. Eight eyes (89%) were completely reattached with a minimum follow-up of three months. In the successfully treated eyes, post-operative visual acuity was 20/200 in two eyes, 20/400 to 5/200 in five eyes, and less than 5/200 in one eye. Direct sealing of macular holes in difficult cases may obviate the need for extended intraocular tamponade or macular buckling with their associated complications.\r"

Patients with thick hemorrhages (causing an obvious elevation of the fovea) had worse final visual acuity than patients with thin hemorrhages (P = .02). The diameter of the hemorrhage was not a significant predictor of outcome. Patients with aging macular degeneration had poorer final visual acuity (mean, 20/1,700, P = .002), and patients with choroidal ruptures had better final visual acuity, (mean 20/35, P less than .001) than the remainder of the patients. We found that the presence of aging macular degeneration was a more important predictor of the outcome of legal blindness than the thickness of the hemorrhage (P = .03). Although the prognosis in patients with subfoveal blood is generally poor, some patients have excellent return of vision.\r"

In the fellow eye of an eye with avascular detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium, the drusen were more densely packed, larger, and less fluorescent than in the fellow eye of an eye with primary neovascularization. The characteristics of drusen in fellow eyes of those eyes with pigment epithelial detachments and evidence of subpigment epithelial new vessels were intermediate between the other two groups. Because there is significant symmetry of drusen between fellow eyes, these data imply that the characteristics of drusen are important in the determination of the form of the lesion complicating age-related macular disease.\r"

Significant positive correlations were seen between asymmetry of visual function and asymmetry of retinal leukocyte velocity in the study population. The eye with the higher velocity of retinal leukocyte flow tended to have better visual function as measured by Humphrey mean deviation (P less than .05), Henson Score (P less than .06), and Vistech contrast sensitivity score at 6 cycles/degree (P less than .001). An association of borderline significance was found between the asymmetries of intraocular pressure and retinal leukocyte velocity (P = .06). No significant intraocular pressure:visual field correlations were found on asymmetry analysis, although the inverse relationship between intraocular pressure and contrast sensitivity was significant (P less than .05). Significant correlations were obtained between visual field scores derived from the Henson data and Humphrey parameters mean deviation (P less than .001) and corrected pattern standard deviation (P less than .05) on both asymmetry and single eye analysis.\r"

Three (6.8%) subjects had a temporary conductive hearing loss because of middle ear fluid, and another patient had hearing loss from Crouzon's disease. The remaining three (6.8%) patients demonstrated sensorineural hearing deficit. This hearing impairment was attributed to a cochlear lesion and not to a pontine lesion. We believe that the frequency of sensorineural hearing loss in these patients warrants hearing screening programs similar to those used for infants in neonatal intensive care units.\r"

Disinsertion of the medial rectus muscle resulted in a mean reduction in the distance from the muscle insertion site to the corneoscleral limbus of 0.903 mm (P less than .001), whereas the use of fixation forceps on the insertion to abduct the eye resulted in an additional mean reduction of 0.306 mm (P less than .01). The strabismus surgeon often uses the muscle insertion site as a reference point in determining the desired location for recessing a muscle. Our results suggest that this method of measurement is unreliable in infantile esotropia because the position of the medial rectus muscle insertion site varies considerably during surgery.\r"

In the fetus, hCG beta-positive cells were identified in excess of hCG alpha-positive cells (hCG alpha: 1.38 +/- 0.18/mm2, hCG beta: 4.50 +/- 1.13/mm2). They were usually different populations in serial sections. There were 0.18 +/- 0.03/mm2 synchronously positive cells using the double immunostaining method, comprising approximately 3% of the total positive cells. The immunoreactive material for both subunits was present at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), perinuclear space, and vesicular structures with protruding microvilli in the lumens. hCG alpha was expressed preferentially in the endocrine tumors of the thymus and non-germ-cell tumor, with rare positivity for beta-subunits of glycoprotein hormones. The hCG alpha-immunoreactive material also was present in the granules as well as in RER of the neoplastic cells. In four teratomas of the thymus, hCG alpha-positivity only was present in endocrinelike cells. The subunit profile of hCG was unbalanced in the thymus and isolated hCG alpha-expression in the fetal thymus may represent the endocrine cell with a primitive storage mechanism. The discordant expression of hCG subunits may be common in nontrophoblastic tissues.\r"

A reduction of histochemically demonstrable hexosaminidase activity was the most consistent marker for these foci. Aberrant crypts, marked with permanent ink and embedded in methacrylate, had a marked decrease of hexosaminidase activity compared to the adjacent, normal crypts. Hexosaminidase may be a marker that will aid in the identification of the molecular basis of colon cancer in a manner similar to that of esterase D and retinoblastoma.\r"

A biotinylated DNA probe specific for chromosome 9 was used for in situ hybridization to interphase and terminally differentiated cells, and fluoresceinated avidin or avidin followed by biotinylated alkaline phosphatase was used for probe detection. In a blinded analysis of ten clinical samples from patients with hematologic malignancies and cytogenetically documented monosomy 9 or trisomy 9, the abnormality was identified correctly in each of five cases of monosomy 9 and five cases of trisomy 9. In two cases of trisomy 9, the detection of this numerical chromosomal abnormality in nuclei of segmented neutrophils permitted the deduction that some granulocytic cells were derived from the abnormal clone, but were still capable of terminal differentiation. Analysis of the position of the probe signal in such nuclei did not disclose any ordered localization of the chromosome 9 homologues with respect to segmentation. These results demonstrate that interphase cytogenetic analysis is feasible in peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens, and that this technique may be a useful adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis for the clinical management of patients with hematopoietic malignancies.\r"

The majority of the infected fibers were found in aggregates of peritoneal macrophages, exudate cells, and fibrous tissue. These aggregates developed into granulomas containing not only numerous asbestos fibers, but also cells of various types, including macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, fibroblasts, plasma cells, granulocytes, and mast cells. Cytoplasmic ferritin was abundantly present in macrophages and giant cells. In addition, iron-rich inclusion bodies were detected. The results of this study show that asbestos body formation can occur outside the pleural cavity. Asbestos body formation occurred in the granulomas after periods of 1 month and longer. On the basis of morphologic criteria, various types of asbestos body were distinguished. X-ray microanalysis showed that variations in the density of the coat could attributed to the presence of chemical elements in various concentrations. Evidence is presented that asbestos body formation is an extracellular phenomenon.\r"

It was found that, seven days after CB3 infection, the accumulation of 14C-cholesterol increased by 75% (P less than 0.001) in the heart and by 92% (P less than 0.001) in the aorta. This infection also caused extensive inflammatory lesions (4.5% of tissue section area) and lipid accumulation in the myocardium seven days after inoculation. Seven weeks on a 1% cholesterol-enriched diet did not affect the myocardial area damaged (3.9%), the lethality, or immune cell activity (T, B, and natural killer [NK] cells). The response pattern of myocardial lymphocyte subpopulations was studied with an immune histochemical staining technique. The number of Mac 2+ (macrophages), class II expressing cells, or the T cytotoxic, suppressor/T helper cell ratio was not changed by the cholesterol diet. The number of class II cells tended to increase (38%) with cholesterol and was positively correlated (P less than 0.001) with the Mac 2 expression regardless of the cholesterol diet. Although moderate diet-induced hypercholesterolemia did not alter host response to viral infection, these results support the idea that virus and immune cells may cooperate and play a role in arterial and myocardial lipid accumulation, possibly acting as initiating factors for atherosclerosis.\r"

The authors isolated and characterized these lipid particles. The esterified cholesterol-rich lipid particle was a small lipid droplet and differed from intracellular lipid droplets found in foam cells with respect to size and chemical composition. It had an esterified cholesterol core surrounded by a phospholipid-unesterified cholesterol monolayer. Some aqueous spaces were seen within the particle core. Unesterified cholesterol-rich lipid particles were multilamellated, solid structures and vesicles comprised of single or multiple lamellas. The esterified cholesterol-rich particle had a density less than 1.01 g/ml, whereas the unesterified cholesterol-rich particle had a density between 1.03 and 1.05 g/ml. Both particles were similar in size (90% of both particles ranged in size between 40 to 200 nm in diameter) and had an unesterified cholesterol-to-phospholipid molar ratio of 2.5:1. The predominant phospholipid in both particles was sphingomyelin. The fatty acyl compositions of cholesteryl ester and phospholipid also were similar in both particles. Palmitate, oleate, and linoleate were the major fatty acids in the cholesteryl ester fraction, whereas palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate were predominant in the phospholipid fraction. The origins and the role of these two unusual lipid particles in vessel wall cholesterol metabolism remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the mechanisms by which alveolar macrophages (AM) are attracted to local sites in the lung, the locomotion of AM in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was investigated. Total bronchoalveolar cells (99% AM) obtained by a nondiscriminating bronchoalveolar lavage procedure migrated toward FMLP over a range of concentrations of 10(-12) M to 10(-6) M. Dose-response experiments showed a biphasic response with two peaks of migration obtained respectively at 5 x 10(-10) M and 10(-8) M. Analysis in the presence and absence of a positive gradient of FMLP revealed that the first peak of migration (5 x 10(-10) M FMLP) corresponded predominantly to chemotactic activity whereas the second peak of migration (10(-8) M FMLP) was associated with chemokinetic activity. To further evaluate these activities of oriented (chemotaxis) vs. random (chemokinesis) migration, AM were separated into two fractions by a two-step bronchoalveolar lavage procedure. Whereas fraction 1 displayed exclusively chemokinesis in response to higher concentrations of FMLP (10(-8) M), fraction 2 was totally unresponsive to FMLP over a wide range of concentrations (5 x 10(-11) M - 10(-7) M). When both fractions were combined, however, the chemotactic response to low concentrations of FMLP (5 x 10(-10) M) was restored. Additional analysis of these two AM fractions indicated that fraction 1 AM had a significantly lower degree of adherence and aggregation than fraction 2 AM. These data suggest that cell-cell cooperation is important for AM chemotactic response to FMLP and that such interaction may involve changes in adherence and aggregation.\r"

Vimentin was expressed preferentially in tumor cells of high-grade ductal breast carcinomas (15 of 28 histologic grade 3 vs. 0 of 40 grades 1 and 2). Vimentin expression was found preferentially in tumors with high GF (greater than 15% Ki-67 positive by immunoperoxidase staining) and low ER levels (less than 60 fmols/mg protein by a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay). Sixty-eight percent of tumors in this group were vimentin positive and 88% of all vimentin-positive tumors fell into this category. More than 50% of the tumor cells coexpressed vimentin and keratin. Thus, vimentin expression may be helpful in identifying a substantial subset of ER-independent breast carcinomas with poor prognostic indicators.\r"

The presence of the complete viral genome could be demonstrated by both dot blot DNA hybridization and PCR. IE mRNA but not L mRNA could be demonstrated by in situ DNA hybridization, indicating the presence of latent CMV in the human arterial wall. By PCR 90% of the samples obtained from atherosclerotic patients were shown to contain viral nucleic acids as compared to 53% of patients with maximally grade I atherosclerosis, thus substantiating a role for this virus in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa plays a focal role in primary hemostasis by serving as the cell surface receptor for fibrinogen. Recent studies by several groups have suggested that GPIIb-IIIa, which is dispersed randomly in the resting cell, undergoes migration leading to receptor clustering after platelet activation. The authors have investigated this activation-dependent relocation of fibrinogen receptors on platelets adherent to a standardized artificial surface. The correlative use of immunogold electron microscopy, ligand-gold binding, and stereo (three-dimensional) electron microscopy (EM) revealed specific localization of fibrinogen and its receptor at points of platelet to platelet interaction. Fibrinogen distribution on the plasma membrane, studied through the use of fibrinogen-gold conjugates with whole-mount adherent platelets, was primarily over the granulomere and at the cell periphery corresponding to sites of platelet-platelet interaction. Compared with the general hyalomere, fibrinogen density over the granulomere and at contact regions was increased 12-fold and 22-fold, respectively, and the specificity of binding at these sites was verified by positive competition with native fibrinogen, one of its degradation products (Fragment D1), and by monoclonal antibodies (HP1-1d and AP-2) specific for GPIIb-IIIa. The distribution of receptor antigens, localized by immunogold EM using antibodies against GPIIb-IIIa, also was localized over the hyalomere, where fibrinogen did not bind. To understand this apparently nonfunctional hyalomere GPIIb-IIIa further, correlative immunocytochemistry was performed using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for GPIIb and GPIIIa simultaneously. Colocalization of the antigens was observed consistently over the granulomere and at regions of cell contact, whereas the hyalomere antigens tended to be nonassociated. The studies document GPIIb-IIIa as a function complex at sites of cell interaction where fibrinogen binds.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been implicated strongly as a principal mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock. The authors investigated the in vivo production of TNF in CBA/J and CD-1 mice that had been primed by an intraperitoneal injection of complete Freund's adjuvant followed 2 weeks later by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNF bioactivity peaked in both the ascites and plasma one hour after challenge, and TNF mRNA expression in the ascites cells peaked 30 minutes after LPS. After the induction of bioactivity, an interstitial pulmonary neutrophilic infiltrate occurred that was quantitated both morphometrically and by a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. Peripheral blood neutrophilia and lymphopenia developed after the LPS injection (PMNs: control, 46 +/- 2%; LPS, 65 +/- 3%; Lymphs control, 53 +/- 2%; LPS, 37 +/- 3%). Treatment with dexamethasone (Dex) completely inhibited the pulmonary neutrophilic infiltrate as measured by the (MPO) assay. Because Dex will inhibit the production of several cytokines, anti-TNF antiserum was given to mice at the same time as the LPS challenge to assess specifically the role of TNF in inducing these changes. This antiserum partially blocked the pulmonary neutrophil infiltrate, and completely blocked the peripheral blood changes at one hour after LPS. These data demonstrate that TNF plays an important role in the early pathophysiologic alterations that occur after systemic exposure to LPS.\r"

  ".W": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are synthesized by cells under metabolic stress and are known to enhance a cell's ability to survive life-threatening stress. The authors have begun to examine HSPs in the context of human atherosclerosis. This study demonstrated immunohistochemically the presence of HSP-70 in human and rabbit arteries, and its distribution in relation to necrosis and lipid accumulation, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, in human atherosclerotic plaques. Advanced lesions from 10 human carotid endarterectomy specimens were compared with 11 human aortic specimens from autopsy and 8 rabbit aortas. The immunostaining procedure used a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the inducible form of HSP-70. Normal rabbit aortas were tested for changes in HSP-70 up to 24 hours after removal, and were used as controls for the human aortas. Representative plaques were examined for lipid content by osmium staining, and for smooth muscle cell and macrophage components using cell-specific monoclonal antibodies followed by immunostaining. The results indicated that HSP-70 was present in human and rabbit arteries and remained unchanged in distribution or concentration up to 15 hours after death. HSP-70 was present weakly throughout the media of normal-appearing arterial specimens. In contrast, HSP-70 was concentrated in the central portions of more thickened atheromas around sites of necrosis and lipid accumulation. Macrophages were coincident with these areas and were observed to be lipid-loaded. In contrast, patches of smooth muscle cells were observed in very complicated plaques, but without consistent association with necrosis or increased HSP-70; plaque smooth muscle cells also were observed to contain lipid. Large, relatively avascular and collagenous areas of plaque also were occasionally positive for HSP-70 staining. The results support the hypothesis that elevated HSPs indicate which plaque cells, particularly macrophages, are more stressed in the depth of atheroma, especially in association with necrosis, and should prompt further investigation of the significance of HSP accumulation to the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with Hodgkin's Disease (HD) occasionally develop monomorphic lymphomas in which mononuclear cells, usually large in size, grow in sheets, and in which there are few reacting cells or classic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Twelve patients of this type were reviewed to determine the nature of the monomorphic growth. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from the original diagnostic HD and the monomorphic growths were stained for Leu-M1 (CD15), leukocyte common antigen (LCA, CD45), pan B-cell markers LN1, LN2, and L26, and pan T-cell marker UCHL1 (CD45R) reactive in paraffin-embedded tissues. Cases were included only if the original diagnostic material had the classic histopathologic features of HD, if there was a separate monomorphic growth (in place or time), and if sufficient materials from both phases were available for study. Original diagnoses of HD included nodular sclerosing (NS; 8 cases); lymphocyte predominant (LP; 2 cases); mixed cellularity (MC; 1 case); and lymphocyte depleted (LD: 1 case) types. RS cells in the eight cases of NS HD and one case of MC HD were generally Leu-M1 and LN2 positive, and L26, LN1, UCHL1, and LCA negative. RS cells in one case of NS HD were LCA positive in addition to Leu-M1, LN1, and LN2. Two cases of NS HD showed L26 positive RS cells. Conversely, RS cells and lymphocytic-histiocytic (L and H) variants in the cases of LP HD were Leu-M1 and LN2 negative, and LCA and LN1 positive. The one case of LD HD possessed RS cells that were negative for Leu-M1, but positive for LCA, L26, LN1, and LN2. In seven cases (4 NS, 2 LP, 1 LD) the monomorphic growths possessed a B-cell phenotype (LCA, L26, and LN1 positive; Leu-M1 and UCHL1 negative). In the remaining cases (4 NS, 1 MC), the monomorphic growths were Leu-M1 positive, and displayed phenotypes similar to the RS cells of the original NS HD. Southern blot analysis was performed on the monomorphic components of five cases and showed some form of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in each (4 cases: rearranged heavy chain-joining region gene; 1 case: rearranged Mu chain-constant region gene). Two of these cases expressed L26 and LN1 in the monomorphic phases. Despite apparent immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, one case expressed T-cell antigens Leu-4 (CD3) and Leu-1 (CD5), in addition to Leu-M1 (CD15).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cells from eight different human melanomas and two murine melanomas were injected into the internal carotid artery of anesthetized nude mice. Although all were injected by the same route, particular melanomas produced lesions in different regions of the brain. Two melanoma cell lines isolated originally from brain metastases in patients produced metastases predominantly in the brain parenchyma. In contrast, melanoma cells from subcutaneous or lymph node metastases produced more lesions in the meninges, choroid plexus, and ventricles than in the brain parenchyma. All of the melanomas grew in the brain after a direct intracerebral injection. The pattern of brain metastasis did not correlate with tumorigenicity per se or with the ability of the melanomas to grow in the lungs of nude mice. Two mouse melanomas showed different patterns of experimental metastasis after internal carotid artery injection, with one growing predominantly in the parenchyma and the other more frequently in the meninges and choroid plexus. The growth pattern of human melanoma metastasis in the brain of T cell-deficient nude mice suggests that it is determined by properties unique to each tumor interacting with the host's organ microenvironment.\r"

The mean number of fowl was 5.4 (SD 3.1), with 10.0 (SD 10.7) poultry defecations per 12 hours. Toddlers' hand contact with poultry feces occurred a mean of 2.9 (SD 3.0) times/12 hours. A mean of 3.9 (SD 4.6) feces-to-mouth episodes per household/12 hours occurred both by direct hand-to-mouth contamination and indirectly by handling soiled objects which were then placed in the mouth. There was a strong correlation between feces-to-hand contamination and feces-to-mouth contamination (r = 0.94). There was also an association between feces-to-mouth contamination and the number of stools deposited in the house (r = 0.66). For each additional chicken stool deposited during the day, there was an average increase of 0.27 in feces-to-mouth episodes. We collected feces from 68 infected chickens and found viable Campylobacter jejuni for up to 48 hours after deposition. Yet, a survey of 108 families demonstrated that free-roaming poultry were often not thought of as a health risk for children. An intervention program to reduce oral-fecal contamination should emphasize that all poultry be corralled and not allowed access into the house.\r"

These findings suggest that needles/syringes used in shooting galleries are likely to serve as reservoirs and/or vectors of transmission of the HIV-1 virus, and that although visual inspection of the needle/syringe may be useful in lessening the chance for transmission, even the visually \"clean\" needles may result in transmission of infection.\r"

Cases were selected from the Michigan Kidney Registry and excluded men with diabetic, congenital, and obstructive nephropathies. Controls were selected by random-digit dialing and were pair-matched to cases for age, race, and area of residence. Telephone interviews were conducted with 69 percent of eligible cases and 79 percent of eligible controls. Risk of ESRD was significantly related to phenacetin or acetaminophen consumption (odds ratio(OR) = 2.66), moonshine consumption (OR = 2.43), a family history of renal disease (OR = 9.30); and regular occupational exposures to solvents (OR = 1.51) or silica (OR = 1.67). Particular occupational exposures with elevated risk were solvents used as cleaning agents and degreasers (OR = 2.50) silica exposure in foundries or brick factories (OR = 1.92), and silica exposure during sandblasting (OR = 3.83). Little or no trend of increased risk with duration of exposure was found for these occupational exposures, with the exception of silica in sandblasting. Limitations of these data include representativeness of cases, possible overreporting by cases, and misclassification of exposures inherent in self-reports.\r"

Of the 247 companies reported to the Registry for lead, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspected 18 of 98 companies (18.4 percent) in the manufacturing sector, but only one of 149 companies (0.6 percent) outside the manufacturing sector.

Blood lead levels ranged from 0.53 to 7.91 mumol/L (11 to 164 micrograms/dl). To predict hematocrit as a function of blood lead level and age, we derived non-linear regression models and fit percentile curves. We used logistic regression to predict the probability of hematocrit values less than 35 per cent. We found a strong non-linear, dose-response relationship between blood lead level and hematocrit. This relationship was influenced by age, but (in this age group) not by sex; the effect was strongest in youngest children. In one year-olds, the age group most severely affected, the risk of an hematocrit value below 35 percent was 2 percent above background at blood lead levels between 0.97 and 1.88 mumol/L (20 and 39 micrograms/dl), 18 percent above background at lead levels of 1.93 to 2.85 mumol/L (40 to 59 micrograms/dl), and 40 percent above background at lead levels of 2.9 mumol/L (60 micrograms/dl) and greater; background was defined as a blood lead level below 1.88 mumol/L (20 micrograms/dl). This effect appeared independent of iron deficiency. These findings suggest that blood lead levels close to the currently recommended limit value of 1.21 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dl) are associated with dose-related depression of hematocrit in young children.\r"

Elevated risks were identified for certain white collar occupations: for men employed in engineering, the odds ratio (OR) = 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4, 10.3; for social science professionals, the OR = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 26.1.

Most of elevated brain cancer risks were due to astrocytic cancers, but the excess among agricultural workers occurred in other cell types. No increase in risk was noted for current cigarette smokers (OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.7, 1.5) or ex-smokers (OR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.7, 1.5).

  ".W": "We investigated whether work-related psychologic stress--defined as work characterized by both high psychologic demands and limited control over the response to these demands--increases a woman's risk of delivering a preterm, low birthweight infant. We studied 786 employed pregnant women included in the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience, Youth Cohort (NLSY), a nationally representative sample of 12,686 young adults. Data concerning work status, job title, and other factors affecting pregnancy outcome were obtained from the NLSY. Assessment of job experience was based on job title, using an established catalogue of occupation characteristics. After accounting for the physical exertion entailed in a job, occupational psychologic stress as measured by job title was not associated with preterm, low birthweight delivery for the sample as a whole (Relative risk = 1.16, 95% confidence interval .45, 2.95). For those women who did not want to remain in the work force, work-related stress increased their risk of experiencing this outcome (RR = 8.1, 95% CI 1.5, 50.2). Personal motivation toward work, as well as the physical effort of work, should be considered in evaluating the impact of a job's psychologic characteristics on pregnancy outcome.\r"

In recent years the Soviet Union has experienced a rising infant mortality rate and declining life expectancy. The health care system has been increasingly criticized for its uncaring providers, low quality of care, and unequal access. The proposed measures will increase by 50 percent the state's contribution to health care financing, encourage private medicine on a small scale, and begin experimentation with capitation financing. It seems unlikely that the government will be able to finance its share of planned health improvements, or that private medicine, constrained by the government's tight control, will contribute much in the near term. Recovery of the Soviet economy in general as well as the ability of health care institutions to gain access to Western materials will largely determine the success of reform of the Soviet health care system.\r"

Research in the use of allograft material for reconstructive grafts is of great interest for many reasons, including the advantage of not violating the patient's normal anatomy for donor tissue. A group of eight patients who received arthroscopically inserted freeze-dried bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft tissue for ACL reconstruction were selected for a prospective study. These patients were matched against a group of four autograft controls. Immunologically, the lymphocyte blast transformation test was used to evaluate the host reaction to implanted donor graft. Lymphocytes drawn from each patient were tested for their reaction against a panel of human allograft tendon and goat xenograft tendon homogenates. A stimulation index of greater than 3 was considered a positive reaction. It was hypothesized that a consistent lack of antigenicity would be observed with allograft extracts and that an antigenic reaction would be observed with the xenograft extracts. Six patients (75%) showed an immunologic reaction to the goat xenograft, and four patients (50%) showed an immunologic reaction to at least one human allograft test cell after allograft insertion. One patient had such an intense clinical immunologic response that she required removal of the allograft. All four of the autograft controls had a nonimmunogenic response to testing, as had been expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The predictive value of scintigraphic evaluation and various parameters (age at onset, sex, location and size of lesion) were analyzed. Over a 10 year period, the senior author followed 92 knees in 76 patients, 60 of whom were male and 16 female (11 and 5 bilaterals, respectively). All patients were participants in athletics or exercise programs. All patients had orthopaedic assessment, roentgenographic studies (AP, lateral, and tunnel views), 99m-Technetium phosphate compound joint scintigraphy, and instruction in a symptom-free existence (with all athletic activity proscribed). Patients were reevaluated and scanned every 8 weeks. No casts or braces were used, although crutches were sometimes necessary to maintain symptom-free levels. Based on specific indications for failure of conservative treatment, 50% of these patients failed and underwent surgery. Of the 92 knees, 52 were successfully treated conservatively, while 40 failed. Average followup was 4.2 years. Average age at onset was 12.5 years; the success group averaged 12.1 years and the failure group 13.0 years. The average lesion size was 363.2 mm2, with 309.5 mm2 in the success group and 436.0 mm2 in the failure group. Parameters of location, sex, and scan classification were not statistically significant as predictive factors. This study found no predictors for the success or failure of treatment beyond a moderate correlation of larger lesion size with failed conservative treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A group of 185 freshman physical education students (118 males; 67 females of the same age (18.3 +/- 0.5 years) trained under the same conditions and were exposed to similar extrinsic risk factors. Using a descriptive statistical technique, an analysis of correspondence, the complex interrelation between the criterium variables (acute injuries and overuse injuries) and the predictor variables (intrinsic risk factors; physical characteristics--anthropometric data, physical fitness parameters, flexibility aspects and malalignment of the lower extremities; and psychological factors--16 personality traits) was estimated for males and females separately. Although dynamic strength seems to be an important risk factor in acute injuries, sports accidents must be seen in relation to psychological factors. However, the overuse-prone profile is mainly based on physical traits: a combination of muscle weakness, ligamentous laxity, and muscle tightness predisposes to stress injuries. In addition, these overuse effects are intensified by large body weight and length, a high explosive strength, and malalignment of the lower limbs. Nevertheless, it has to be kept in mind that psychosomatic factors play a role in how one experiences these overuse phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two cases of occult intraosseous fracture in the region of the knee are presented. Occult intraosseous fractures have been incidentally detected in the magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the knee in the setting of a recent physical injury and normal radiographic studies. There is no unique mechanism of injury, but occult intraosseous fracture presumably results from direct impaction or axial overloading. MR shows speckled or band-like areas of low signal in the intramedullary space of the epiphyses, and occasionally, the adjacent metaphyses. In most cases, T2-weighted images show high signal in corresponding regions of variable size. The relative extent of high signal findings is shown to vary significantly with the age of injury. Individual variability within groups, however, precludes the actual prediction of lesion age on the basis of the MR appearance. Our observations provide indirect evidence that the findings on T2-weighted images resolve earlier than the corresponding findings on T1-weighted proton density images. The primary differential diagnosis in cases of occult intraosseous fracture is stress fracture. The diagnosis of occult intraosseous fracture may be important in explaining persistent pain after injury in otherwise normal knees.\r"

Fifteen healthy subjects (29.1 +/- 8 years of age) trained 1 day per week for 10 weeks and 10 healthy subjects (33.7 +/- 16 years of age) acted as controls. Training consisted of 6 to 15 repetitions of full range of motion variable resistance lumbar extension exercise to volitional fatigue and periodic maximal isometric contractions taken at seven angles through a full range of motion. Before and after the 10 week training period, subjects completed a maximum isometric strength test at seven angles through a 72 degrees range of motion (0 degrees, 12 degrees, 24 degrees, 36 degrees, 48 degrees, 60 degrees, and 72 degrees of lumbar flexion). The training group significantly improved in lumbar extension strength at all angles (P less than or equal to 0.01). The result at 0 degrees (full extension) showed an increase from 180.0 +/- 25 Nm to 364.1 +/- 43 Nm (+102%) and at 72 degrees (full flexion) from 427.4 +/- 44.1 to 607.4 +/- 68 (+42%) Nm. Results from the control group showed no change (P greater than or equal to 0.05). The magnitude of gain shown by the training group reflects the low initial trained state of the lumbar extensor muscles. These data indicate that when the lumbar area is isolated through pelvic stabilization, the isolated lumbar extensor muscles show an abnormally large potential for strength increase.\r"

However, contrary to popular belief, the Bankart repair does not precisely restore the premorbid anatomy. The capsule is reattached to the boney rim of the anterioinferior glenoid deep to and lateral to the torn cartilagenous labrum, thus excluding the labrum from the joint anteriorly. This was demonstrated by cross-sectional cadaver dissections performed to illustrate this complex surgical anatomy to orthopaedic residents in training. In addition, when correlated with double-contrast computerized axial tomography, we noted five predominant patterns of anatomical lesions which by common use have been collectively termed the \"Bankart lesion.\" These are: 1) the rare \"classic\" Bankart lesion in which the cartilagenous labrum and capsular origin are torn from the glenoid rim; 2) the capsule stripped from the scapular neck and the labrum detached from the glenoid rim remaining fixed to the overlying capsule; 3) the capsule stripped from the scapular neck and the labrum separated from the glenoid rim, but separately; 4) the labrum abraded away and no longer radiographically detectable; and 5) glenoid rim fracture.\r"

The accuracy of each diagnosis was confirmed by determining the site of the injury during the arthrotomy. A tear of the posteromedial corner of the medial meniscus was present in 40 patients, and an accurate diagnosis was made in 29 patients by clinical examination, in all 40 patients by arthrography, and in 38 patients by arthroscopy. Injury of the posterior oblique ligament was noted in 37 patients, and an accurate diagnosis was made in 15 patients by clinical examination, in 35 patients by arthrography, and in 8 patients by arthroscopy. Lesions of the posterior oblique ligament which were not detected in the arthroscopic examination alone were either rupture at the attachment to the femur or longitudinal tears in the meniscofemoral or meniscotibial portion. The results revealed that arthrography is an important means of evaluation in the diagnosis of injuries of the posteromedial corner of the knee joint.\r"

Although there was a great deal of variation in the muscle activation patterns during subluxation, subjects either pushed the humeral head backwards with the anterior muscles (deltoid, biceps) or pulled the humeral head backwards with the infraspinatus and/or posterior deltoid. In all cases, inhibition of the scapular rotators and winging of the scapula accompanied this maneuver. The method used in this study is presented as an objective technique for quantifying EMG activity during subluxation and relocation phases of shoulder instability.\r"

Twenty percent of normal knees tested showed more than this variation between knees when different observers were compared and also when the same observers were compared at three week intervals. There is thus a question about the use of this machine in a general orthopaedic clinic with different observers.\r"

Among the patients presenting with this exertional pain syndrome were runners, football players, and cyclists. Diagnosis was clinical since radiographs were negative and an ultrasound examination was positive in only one case, showing an aberrant picture around the lateral femoral epicondyle. Although conservative treatment is effective in most cases, an alternative is needed for patients with complaints that are resistant to conservative means. Surgery was done with the knee held in 60 degrees of flexion and consisted of a limited resection of a small triangular piece at the posterior part of the iliotibial band covering the lateral femoral epicondyle. The uniform good results, low morbidity, and quick return to sports demonstrate that this type of surgery offers a solution for selected cases of failed prolonged conservative treatment.\r"

It can, however, present in association with athletic activity and therefore must be included in the differential diagnosis of athletes with such symptomatology. Findings that should alert the examiner to the possible presence of acute brachial neuropathy include 1) onset with noncontact as well as contact sports, 2) rather acute onset of pain without specific inciting trauma, 3) persistent, often severe pain that continues despite rest, 4) patchy brachial plexus and/or peripheral nerve involvement, and, 5) dominant arm predominance of symptoms and signs. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies often can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment begins with rest and continues through a rehabilitation phase. Followup of athletes with acute brachial neuropathy discloses that weakness may persist in the affected muscles. Absolute strength parity may be difficult to achieve, so permission to participate in athletics must be given on a case by case basis.\r"

Seven patients had undergone previous surgery. All but one had a favorable response to initial blockade. This individual eventually failed treatment despite surgical sympathectomy. Seven have required readministration of a block for clinical relapse. Mean followup was 22 months (range, 10 to 41 months). Five underwent extensive psychological testing. All have required adjunctive forms of therapy including physical therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), antiinflammatory or other nonnarcotic agents. Recovery is typically prolonged, particularly if the diagnosis is delayed. Close attention to, and therefore prevention of, situations that trigger its recurrence is essential for successful rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "A model of metatarsal mechanics has been proposed as a link between the high incidence of second and third metatarsal stress fractures and the large stresses measured beneath the second and third metatarsal heads during distance running. Eight discrete piezoelectric vertical stress transducers were used to record the forefoot stresses of 21 male distance runners. Based upon load bearing area estimates derived from footprints, plantar forces were estimated. Highest force was estimated beneath the second and first metatarsal head (341.1 N and 279.1 N, respectively). Considering the toe as a hinged cantilever and the metatarsal as a proximally attached rigid cantilever allowed estimation of metatarsal midshaft bending strain, shear, and axial forces. Bending strain was estimated to be greatest in the second metatarsal (6662 mu epsilon), a value 6.9 times greater than estimated first metatarsal strain. Predicted third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal strains ranged between 4832 and 5241 mu epsilon. Shear force estimates were also greatest in the second metatarsal (203.0 N). Axial forces were highest in the first metatarsal (593.2 N) due to large hallux forces in relationship to the remaining toes. Although a first order model, these data highlight the structural demands placed upon the second metatarsal, a location of high metatarsal stress fracture incidence during distance running.\r"

The knee, shoulder, and ankle were most frequently affected. Female triathletes and those more than 40 years of age showed a similar injury incidence and distribution. Elite triathletes averaged more miles per week in each sport than the athletes as a whole and showed a higher incidence of injury (60%), although this was not a significant difference. Higher weekly swimming, cycling, and running mileages did not lead to a higher incidence of injury. The likelihood of injury was independent of age, sex, body mass index, mileage per week, or other training factors evaluated in the study.\r"

Two hundred fifty-one injuries were recorded among a player population of 598, resulting in an injury rate of 42.1% per 100 players. All of the players followed a prescribed preseason summer conditioning program that was endorsed by the Illinois High School Athletic Association. The injuries were recorded on an athletic injury profile and entered into a computer for data analysis and retrieval. The injury distribution by player position showed that halfbacks, tackles, linebackers, and guards had a higher risk of injury than other positions. The knee was the body part injured most frequently (20.3%). A matrix of injuries to halfbacks was set up to examine the relationship of body part injured to type of play, time of injury, and activity during injury. An anthropometric study using the Quetelet index did not reveal any correlation between injury and body size when the injured players were compared with the non-injured players. Experience since 1969 has taught us many of the errors and pitfalls involved in injury surveillance. Strict adherence to recording of data will ensure an accurate and useful injury surveillance program.\r"

Initially, 30 white Wistar rats, 15 males and 15 females, were treated weekly with either 0.52 cc of physiologic saline or nandrolone decanoate. After 6 weeks, female treated and control rats had comparable weight gains, but male treated rats were significantly lighter than controls. Rats were sacrificed and organs dissected for histologic preparation. Treated male livers had less lipid than control males. The uteri of treated females displayed abnormal vacuolization, stromal edema, and peliosis. In Part II, 12 male rats, 6 treated and 6 control, were given the drug or saline in a manner identical to that in Part I. Treated rats had lower weights from Weeks 1 through 6 and ate less than controls. Upon sacrifice, treated rats' kidneys were heavier, and testes and liver were lighter compared to controls. Roentgenographic studies of tibias from Parts I and II showed no significant differences in tibial length or height of growth plate between treated and control groups. In summary, when anabolic steroid use is studied in the rat model, numerous pathological and anatomical changes occur.\r"

Motor blockade was assessed by use of a modified Bromage scale after each determination of level of analgesia. Fifteen venous blood samples were collected over 12 h after ropivacaine injection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using serum concentration-time data. No significant differences were found between the three groups in terms of onset or recovery of motor and sensory blockade. Median maximum thoracic levels of analgesia achieved were 8, 6, and 5 for the 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0% groups, respectively, and occurred at 29 +/- 11, 37 +/- 21, and 30 +/- 9 min. Respective times to two-segment regression were 2.8 +/- 1.0, 3.0 +/- 0.5, and 2.9 +/- 0.6 h. Total durations of sensory blockade were 5.4 +/- 0.7, 6.5 +/- 0.4, and 6.8 +/- 0.8 h, respectively. No statistically significant differences were noted between the three groups in terms of clearance (CL). The mean residence time (MRT) was significantly longer for the 0.5% group when compared with the 1% group. The peak concentration (Cmax) for the 0.5% group was found to be significantly lower than for either the 0.75% or 1% groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study has examined whether adverse halothane effects on liver-cell energy metabolism are influenced by the availability of alternate substrates for energy-generating reactions. Halogenated volatile anesthetics affect both energy supply and energy demand in tissues, and cellular energy deficits have been implicated in anesthetic hepatotoxicity. Using hepatocytes isolated from fed rats either pretreated with phenobarbital or not treated (+PB or -PB cells, respectively), we studied the cellular energetic effects of providing fatty acid (oleic acid) along with glucose as substrate(s) for energy metabolism, while exposing the cells to 0%-2% halothane. In -PB cells incubated with glucose alone, there were halothane dose-related decreases in the oxygen (O2) consumption rate (VO2) and in the balance between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and demand (ATP/ADP ratio), but no effect on lactate metabolism (lactate consumption or production) over the 10-min incubation period. Adding oleate along with glucose (a) raised VO2 but lowered ATP/ADP in the absence of halothane; (b) eliminated the decreases in VO2 and ATP/ADP seen when halothane was introduced; and (c) increased lactate consumption in both the presence and absence of halothane. In +PB cells, VO2 was higher, ATP/ADP lower, and lactate consumption also lower than in -PB cells under comparable conditions. Halothane or oleate effects, or both, on energy metabolism were thus qualitatively similar in +PB and -PB cells, except that in +PB cells incubated without oleate, lactate formation developed as halothane was increased from 0% to 2%, reflecting activation of glycolysis due to insufficient mitochondrial ATP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The severity of constant incisional pain, movement-associated incisional pain, and pain upon pressure applied to the surgical wound using an algometer was assessed with a visual analogue self-rating method at 24 h, 48 h, and 10 days after surgery. The addition of local anesthesia significantly decreased the intensity of all types of postoperative pain. This effect was especially evident with constant incisional pain that disappeared almost completely 24 h after surgery. With pain caused by pressure on the site of the surgical incision, the pain score difference between general and general plus local anesthesia was obvious even 10 days after the surgery (with 0.4-kg/cm2 pressure, the pain scores were 16 +/- 3 vs 2 +/- 1, P less than 0.01). The difference in postoperative pain scores between spinal and general anesthesia groups indicated that spinal anesthesia also decreases the pain intensity. However, this decrease is less pronounced than that seen with the addition of local anesthesia: movement-associated pain scores 24 h after surgery were 72 +/- 5 in the general anesthesia group, 40 +/- 6 in the spinal anesthesia group, and 16 +/- 3 in the general plus local anesthesia group (with P less than 0.002 between the groups).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Relative to presently used potent inhalation anesthetics, desflurane has low blood/gas (0.42) and oil/gas (18.7) partition coefficients. These indicate that it will undergo rapid washin and washout (and hence rapid induction of and recovery from anesthesia) and have a MAC value of about 5%. In the present study we demonstrate that desflurane possesses these characteristics in healthy young volunteers. After a 10-min exposure to desflurane the ratio of alveolar (FA) (determined by end-tidal sampling) to inspired (FI) concentration (FA/FI) was 0.82. Washout was similarly rapid; 10 min after discontinuing administration of desflurane, the alveolar concentration relative to the last concentration during administration of anesthetic (FAO) was 0.11 (FA/FAO). These values are similar to those for nitrous oxide. Volunteers responded to commands an average of 2.7 min after discontinuing anesthetic administration. The values for MAC-awake and MAC (the latter determined by tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve using surface electrodes) were 2.42% and 4.58% and the ratio of the former to the latter was 0.53.\r"

Small but statistically significant differences were noted in heart rate, diastolic and systolic arterial pressures, and rate-pressure product between the patients with electrocardiographic changes and those without. The authors speculate that myocardial ischemia is a likely cause of both the electrocardiographic changes seen in these patients and of the symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea that they sometimes experience.\r"

This study compared the hemodynamic effects of graded doses of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) with those of AMP when infused alone or in combination with the positive inotropic agent dopamine (DA) in anesthetized dogs. Both SNP (2-25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and AMP (200-2500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were effective vasodilators and reduced systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Heart rate and cardiac index were increased by both agents. When compared at dosages that caused similar decreases in arterial pressure, cardiac index was increased more by AMP than by SNP. Also, AMP-induced vasodilation was associated with less tachyphylaxis. Sodium nitroprusside and AMP, at the dosages used, did not depress atrioventricular nodal conduction or antagonize DA-induced increases in renal blood flow. At equivalent decreases in mean arterial pressure, the increase from baseline in cardiac and stroke indices observed with AMP alone was further increased by the concomitant administration of DA. These results suggest that AMP and DA-AMP may offer significant advantages over SNP or DA-SNP in situations where elevation of cardiac output and reduction in afterload are required.\r"

We examined the effects of different anesthetics on hepatic circulation, oxygenation, and function after hepatic ischemic insult in 28 miniature pigs weighing 20-27 kg. The preparation allowed a stepwise decrease followed by a complete cessation for 1 h of hepatic blood and oxygen supply. Immediately after the unclamping of both vessels supplying the liver and restoration of the hepatic circulation, systemic mean arterial pressure decreased to approximately 75% of preischemic values in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital and fentanyl and to 60% of preischemic values in pigs anesthetized with halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane. Total hepatic blood flow immediately returned to preischemic values without significant difference between the groups. Subsequently, hepatic oxygen delivery returned to 75%-95% of preischemic values. Hepatic oxygen uptake returned to 50%-60% of preischemic values in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital and with volatile anesthetics and up to 80% and then later to baseline values with fentanyl anesthesia. Lactate uptake by the liver returned to preischemic values only in animals given fentanyl or isoflurane but remained at approximately 50% of preischemic values during enflurane and 20%-40% during halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia. Thus, the study indicates that both isoflurane and fentanyl anesthesia provide more protection from ischemic insult than do halothane, enflurane, or pentobarbital anesthesia.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first time that substance P has been identified in human saliva. These findings, together with the noninvasive nature of saliva collection, suggest that substance P in saliva may be useful as an alternative neurochemical correlate of chronic low back pain when collection of cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples for substance P analysis is unacceptable or inappropriate.\r"

However, decreases in heart rate were significantly more frequent in the immediate postoperative period in patients given labetalol.

Compared with patients receiving continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion, at 18 h postoperatively patients given continuous epidural fentanyl infusion reported similar pain scores both at rest (22 +/- 25 vs 27 +/- 21, P = 0.52) and with ambulation (59 +/- 18 vs 56 +/- 22, P = 0.82). Plasma fentanyl levels were 1.8 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.4 ng/mL (P = 0.91) for the intravenous and epidural groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of nausea, pruritus, or urinary retention. There was no respiratory depression in either group.

Epidural blood patch after dural puncture did not lead to any further decrease in the rate of good analgesia with subsequent epidural anesthetics. Parturients who request epidural analgesia and who have had previous dural puncture with or without blood patch should be informed about the 35%-40% chance of poor epidural analgesia.\r"

Fifteen patients scheduled for lower limb orthopedic surgery were enrolled in the study. As the concentration of ropivacaine increased from 0.5% to 1.0%, the time to onset of sensory anesthesia decreased from 6.4 +/- 1.7 (SD) min to 2.4 +/- 0.6 min and the maximum level of sensory anesthesia increased from T6 to T1. These changes were not statistically significant. Time to regression of anesthesia to T12 increased from 255 +/- 73 min with the 0.5% solution to 356 +/- 75 min with 1.0% ropivacaine (P less than 0.05). The degree of motor blockade using the Bromage scale varied with the concentration. When the 0.5% concentration was used, only one patient (20%) had greater than 1+ motor blockade. However, all of the patients receiving the 0.75% or 1.0% solution had at least 2+ motor blockade. Sensory anesthesia was adequate for surgery in 14 of the 15 patients. The mean peak plasma concentration of ropivacaine (Cmax) increased from 0.65 +/- 0.15 micrograms/mL with the 100-mg dose to 1.30 +/- 0.43 microgram/mL with the 200-mg dose. No adverse effects were noted in any patient in the study. These initial studies in humans suggest that ropivacaine provides satisfactory sensory anesthesia with minimal motor blockade at a concentration of 0.5%. An increase in concentration resulted in a more profound motor blockade. The Cmax of ropivacaine in this study was below levels associated with toxicity in animal studies.\r"

In conscious dogs low [Ca2+] (decreased 0.35 mM); increased heart rate (HR) and mean aortic pressure (MAP) and decreased stroke volume (SV) and LV dP/dtmax. Low [Ca2+] increased HR during all three anesthetics and decreased LV dP/dtmax except during isoflurane anesthesia. Low [Ca2+] produced more hemodynamic depression during enflurane anesthesia than during anesthesia with halothane or isoflurane increasing left atrial pressure and decreasing MAP and SV. The differences seen were partially related to decreased systemic vascular resistance during halothane and isoflurane anesthesia. In conscious dogs following high [Ca2+] (increased 0.37 mM); only MAP and LV dP/dtmax increased. LVdP/dtmax was also increased by high [Ca2+] during all three anesthetics without a change in MAP. Cardiac output increased during halothane and isoflurane anesthesia but was unchanged during enflurane. It would appear that the hemodynamic sensitivity for the effects of changing [Ca2+] was enflurane greater than halothane greater than isoflurane greater than awake. The results suggest that the effects of changes in [Ca2+] induced by citrate and CaCl2 infusion are modified by the three volatile anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of albuterol (a beta 2 specific adrenergic agonist) on airway reactivity to histamine aerosol challenge was evaluated during halothane anesthesia and thiopental-fentanyl anesthesia in five Basenji Greyhound dogs. Responses to histamine aerosol challenges (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/ml) were measured during thiopental-fentanyl anesthesia and during halothane anesthesia in the presence and absence of iv albuterol (2.5 micrograms/kg). Prior to aerosol challenges, baseline pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) did not differ in the four conditions. Albuterol significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to histamine during thiopental-fentanyl anesthesia. Although halothane itself significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to histamine, this response was further attenuated by the addition of albuterol. This study suggests that albuterol is effective in attenuating bronchoconstriction during both thiopental-fentanyl and halothane anesthesia. As the effects of albuterol and halothane on the airways are additive, beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol are the agents of choice to treat bronchospasm in patients anesthetized with inhalational anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of different vasopressors on the cerebral pressure-flow relationship during 1.0 MAC isoflurane anesthesia has been studied. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased by one of three vasopressors [angiotensin II (AT), norepinephrine (NE), or phenylephrine (PE)] in three groups of New Zealand white rabbits (n = 11, 10, and 9, respectively). Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured at five intervals by the injection of radioactive microspheres at a stable 2.05% (1.0 MAC) end-tidal isoflurane concentration (baseline) and following elevation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% above baseline MAP with either AT, NE, or PE. Baseline MAP was the same in all groups. No differences in MAP were seen between groups when MAP was elevated from 20% to 80% above baseline. Normocapnia (PaCO2 35.8-38.2 mmHg) was maintained throughout. Total cerebral blood flow (tCBF), hemispheric CBF (hCBF), and posterior fossa (cerebellum and brain stem) CBF (pCBF) were determined. Baseline tCBF, hCBF, and pCBF was similar in all groups. For each experiment a pressure-flow curve was generated by curvilinear regression analysis. Mean slopes and intercepts were derived for each group. For all regions examined, the slope of the pressure-flow curve was significantly less steep when MAP was elevated with AT versus NE or PE (P less than 0.05 Tukey's studentized range test). There was no difference in slope between the NE and PE groups for any region. These results indicate that either NE and PE result in indirect cerebral vasodilation or that AT has intrinsic cerebral vasoconstrictive effects during 1.0 MAC isoflurane anesthesia in the rabbit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Human and animal experiments have not consistently shown halothane to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). The authors used a canine lung lobe perfused in situ to more precisely characterize the effects of halothane on HPV. The pulmonary vasculature can be divided into inflow, middle, and outflow segments by sequentially occluding the lobar inflow and outflow of blood. The lobes were ventilated with four different gas mixtures (normoxia, hypoxia, normoxia/halothane, hypoxia/halothane) and measured inflow, outflow, and middle segment (Rm) resistances using this stop-flow technique. All values are shown as means +/- standard deviation. The authors found that hypoxia increased Rm from normoxia values of .006 +/- .005 cmH2O.ml-1.min-1 to .025 +/- .008 cmH2O.ml-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05). During hypoxia/halothane Rm returned to .005 +/- .004 cmH2O.ml-1.min-1. The relationship between pressure and flow (P-Q) for the lobes for each gas mixture was also determined. The slopes of the P-Q lines by linear regression were all similar. The zero-flow pressure intercepts of the P-Q lines for normoxia (3.2 +/- .9 cmH2O) and hypoxia (4.4 +/- 1.1 cmH2O) were significantly decreased after the administration of halothane (1.7 +/- 1.0 cmH2O and 2.6 +/- 1.0 cmH2O, respectively). Since the zero-flow intercept likely reflects the tone at alveolar vessel level, the authors conclude that halothane inhibits HPV by decreasing the tone in the middle vascular segment.\r"

After intubation facilitated by isoflurane 2-3%, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (0.5% in oxygen) and fentanyl (4 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1). Ventilation was controlled to keep end-tidal CO2 at 35-40 mmHg, body temperature maintained at 35.5-37.5 degrees C, and arterial pH at 7.35-7.50. The right sciatic nerve was stimulated with a nerve stimulator delivering a single twitch at 0.1 Hz with 0.2-ms duration, at supramaximal stimulation. The force of the corresponding evoked isometric muscle contraction was continuously measured by a force-displacement transducer. A single iv bolus of atracurium (2 mg/kg) was given to obtain a 90-95% twitch depression, followed 5 min later by a constant-rate iv infusion of atracurium at 120 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 maintained during the entire investigation. Blood samples for plasma atracurium and laudanosine concentrations were drawn every 15 min. In the control group, plasma concentrations of atracurium remained stable between 6.5-8.0 micrograms/ml following initial bolus injection; plasma concentrations of laudanosine increased during the first 60 min, then remained stable between 0.69-0.74 micrograms/ml up to the end of the study. In animals undergoing transplantation, plasma concentrations of atracurium remained stable between 10-12 micrograms/ml, despite a 90-min duration of liver exclusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Brief pharmacologic reductions of blood pressure were employed in 11 healthy volunteers to determine the effects of N2O on baroreflex-mediated increases in heart rate and efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity. R-R intervals (ECG), blood pressure (radial artery), central venous pressure, respiratory rate (abdominal bellows), and end-tidal gas concentrations (mass spectrometer) were monitored. Efferent sympathetic nerve activity directed to skeletal muscle blood vessels (MSNA) was recorded from an epoxy-coated tungsten needle placed into the peroneal nerve. Data were obtained from six subjects before and during iv bolus administration of sodium nitroprusside (100 micrograms), during control while breathing 40% N2/60% O2, during administration of N2O (40% N2O/60% O2), and during recovery (40% N2/60% O2). Five subjects served as time controls and breathed 40% N2 in O2 throughout the protocol. Nitrous oxide produced a 59 +/- 18% (P less than 0.05) increase in baseline MSNA but did not alter the reflex augmentations in MSNA produced by nitroprusside. In contrast, there was a 39 +/- 14% decrease in the slope of the relationship between systolic pressure and R-R interval (P less than 0.05) in subjects breathing N2O. N2O thus produces activation of the sympathetic nerves directed to skeletal muscle blood vessels, and it decreases baroreflex-mediated tachycardia without diminishing baroreflex-mediated augmentations in sympathetic outflow.\r"

This investigation was designed to determine the accuracy of a clinical system, which included 12 ICU bedside stations monitored by a medical mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer RMS III, Pomona, CA). Each site station was connected to the analyzing unit via two Teflon tubes, one permanently installed, 30-m long, and the second disposable, 2.4-m long. A gas mixture containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2, alternating with room air, was delivered to a solenoid valve and from there to the connecting tubes. Gas flow-rate, delay time, rise time, and peak and trough concentrations were determined for each gas at solenoid cycling frequencies of 25, 50, and 100/min. After the first set of measurements, the 30-m tubes were thoroughly cleaned and all measurements repeated. In addition, the authors also measured CO2 delay and rise times when the gas was delivered to the mass spectrometer through an unused 30-m tube or a new 2.4-m tube. Gas flow-rate increased from 143 +/- 12 ml/min (mean +/- SD) to 238 +/- 9 ml/min after the tubes were cleaned. Delay time was identical for all gases at all solenoid cycling rates but decreased significantly (P less than 0.05), from 11.5 +/- 0.3 to 4.8 +/- 0.7 s after the ceiling tubes were cleaned. As solenoid valve rate increased, the difference between measured and actual gas concentration increased. The lowest accuracy was 63.6 +/- 2.1%, for CO2 at 100 cycles/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ketamine alone and in combination with N2O (70% inspired) on median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was investigated in 16 neurologically normal patients undergoing elective abdominopelvic procedures. The anesthetic regimen consisted of ketamine (2 mg/kg iv bolus followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 30 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) [corrected], neuromuscular blockade (atracurium), and mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen. SSEP recordings were obtained immediately preinduction and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min postinduction. Thereafter, N2O was added with surgical incision and maintained for 15 min. At 5-min intervals, SSEP recordings were again taken during and after N2O. With minor exceptions, mean cortical and noncortical latencies as well as noncortical-evoked potential amplitude were unaffected by either ketamine or N2O. Ketamine induction increased cortical amplitude significantly with maximal increases occurring within 2-10 min. For example, at 5-min postinduction, mean N1-P1 amplitude increased from 2.58 +/- 1.05 (baseline) to 2.98 +/- 1.20 microV and P1-N2 amplitude increased from 2.12 +/- 1.50 (baseline) to 3.99 +/- 1.76 microV. Throughout the 30-min period after ketamine induction, mean P1-N2 amplitude increased generally by more (57-88%) than did mean N1-P1 amplitude (6-16%). N2O added to the background ketamine anesthetic produced a rapid and consistent reduction in both N1-P1 and P1-N2 amplitude. Thus, at 1 min after N2O, mean N1-P1 amplitude decreased from 2.74 +/- 1.11 to 1.64 +/- 0.63 microV, while P1-N2 amplitude decreased from 3.32 +/- 1.52 to 1.84 +/- 0.87 microV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors studied the effects of sustained contact and associated surface pressure on the esophagus by a TEE probe in anesthetized dogs and humans. Contact pressure between the tip of the probe and the esophageal wall in dogs was measured using a previously described flat balloon of Silastic fitted to the end of a TEE probe and the recording system calibrated with a mercury manometer. In the dog studies, the probe was inserted, maximally flexed, and its position fixed for 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. The maximum surface pressure generated by contact between a probe and the esophageal wall was 10 mmHg. Subsequent pathologic studies failed to reveal either gross or microscopic evidence of tissue damage. The same system was used in short-term patient studies with the surface contact pressure transducer connected to a Camino Catheter 420 Digital Pressure Monitor. In five of six patients contact pressure was less than 17 mmHg despite maximal rotation of the TEE controls. However, one of the six patients developed very high contact pressure, up to 60 mmHg, between the probe and the esophagus. This patient had no history of esophageal disease but did have intrathoracic pathology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscle fiber type was determined by contracture occurring in strontium (slow-oxidative, type I fiber) or calcium (both type I and type II, fast glycolytic fiber) solutions and in several fibers after contracture testing by ATPase enzyme histochemistry. Caffeine sensitivity (mean +/- SD), defined as the threshold concentration inducing more than 10% of the maximal tension obtained with a calcium 3 x 10(-5) mM solution was 2.7 +/- 1.3 mM in 37 type I fibers, whereas it was 6.9 +/- 2.4 mM in 61 type II fibers. A paired t test showed a significantly increased sensitivity to caffeine in type I fibers (P less than 0.001) in 13 individuals in whom the two fiber types were identified. The mean (+/- SD) difference between type I and type II fibers was 4.1 +/- 1.9 mM. Type I fibers contracted with greater tension in response to the increasing concentration of caffeine than did type II fibers (P less than 0.05). These skinned fiber studies showed significantly different caffeine sensitivities between human type I and type II muscle fibers, as previously shown in animal muscles. The findings that human type I muscle fibers have higher caffeine sensitivity than type II muscle fibers should be helpful for the interpretation of the in vitro contracture test done in muscle strips containing type I and type II fibers in varying proportions.\r"

Measurements of representative fetal whole organ blood flows, cardiac output, and cerebral oxygen consumption were also made during each of the three experimental periods. During asphyxia alone regional and total brain, heart, and adrenal flows increased above control while flow to the spleen and carcass decreased. Similar responses were seen during asphyxia plus isoflurane-oxygen. Fetal arterial and sagittal sinus pH, base excess, po2, and oxygen saturation decreased, and hydrogen ion concentrations and pco2 increased during asphyxia alone and asphyxia plus isoflurane-oxygen. Cerebral oxygen consumption decreased significantly from control during asphyxia plus isoflurane-oxygen, whereas no significant changes occurred in cerebral oxygen delivery. These results support the conclusions that in the asphyxiated fetus: 1) acidosis is increased; 2) cardiac output is redistributed to vital organs; and 3) the balance of cerebral oxygen supply-to-demand is maintained during maternal isoflurane-oxygen anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Caffeine and halothane contracture testing is widely used to detect malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. The accuracy and reliability of the 3% halothane test and the incremental caffeine test, as recommended by the North American MH Group, were assessed in 11 swine (five MHS, six control). Nine swine were tested twice, 4-6 weeks apart. Accuracy of the in vitro diagnosis was also assessed by in vivo anesthetic challenge. Of all muscle bundles from MH-susceptible swine, 65% reacted positively to 3% halothane and 70% to 2 mM caffeine. Only 35% had a positive caffeine-specific concentration, and 25% developed an increase in baseline tension greater than or equal to 7% at 2 mM caffeine. However, when only the most positive response to 3% halothane or to 2 mM caffeine was used (a minimum of three fresh muscle strips is recommended), these two tests were highly sensitive and specific. In control swine one of 30 muscle bundles reacted positively to 3% halothane. A positive caffeine-specific concentration developed in one of 25 control muscle bundles exposed to caffeine. The variability in the results of these tests mandated that at least three muscle bundles be used for each test. Nonviable muscle bundles could not be relied upon to provide accurate results. In this porcine model, MH susceptibility could be detected by performing the Caffeine Halothane Contracture Test (CHCT) according to the guidelines of the North American MH Group. However, only the 3% halothane test and the response to 2 mM caffeine produced adequate diagnostic results in this breed of swine.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary vascular tone was investigated by the construction of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)/cardiac output (Q) plots, and gas exchange, by the multiple inert gas elimination technique, in 24 anesthetized dogs before and after pulmonary embolization of autologous clots. Three PAP/Q plots were obtained by a manipulation of venous return at baseline and 60 min and 110 min after embolization. Before the third PAP/Q plot, the dogs were randomly allocated to one of the following iv treatments: 1) placebo (n = 6); 2) prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) 0.4 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (n = 6); 3) hydralazine 2 mg/kg (n = 6); and 4) nitroprusside 10 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (n = 6). These vasodilators decreased systemic arterial pressure by a mean of 44%. Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions were determined at the same Q (2.4 +/- 0.1 l.min-1.m-2, mean +/- SE) of each PAP/Q plot. Embolization increased the intercept and the slope of the PAP/Q plots (P less than 0.001). Distributions of VA/Q were only moderately impaired, with an increased dispersion of both VA and Q and a shift of VA distributions to higher VA/Q. PaO2 changed from 208 +/- 5 to 172 +/- 8 mmHg (P less than 0.01) (fraction of inspired O2 was 0.4). None of the treatments had any effect on VA/Q distributions. Placebo and PGE1 had no effect on PAP/Q plots. Hydralazine and nitroprusside reduced the slope of the PAP/Q plots. Thus, in this canine model of acute pulmonary embolism: 1) VA/Q distributions were moderately impaired accounting for only slight hypoxemia, and 2) pulmonary hypertension was partially reversible by hydralazine and by nitroprusside without associated non-flow-dependent change in VA/Q distributions and arterial oxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Using a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia the effects of isoflurane (iso) and methohexital (metho) were compared with those of 70% nitrous oxide controls (N2O). Two levels of incomplete cerebral ischemia were produced by right carotid occlusion plus hypotension for 30 min: moderate = 30 mmHg, FIO2 = 0.30; severe = 25 mmHg, FIO2 = 0.20. The iso doses (1 and 2 MAC) and metho doses (0.01 and 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1) were tested at each ischemic level. These iso and metho doses were selected because without ischemia they produced similar decreases in cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) compared with that produced in N2O controls. In the absence of ischemia, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was suppressed by 0.01 mg.kg-1.min-1 metho and 1 MAC iso and showed burst-suppression with 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 metho and 2 MAC iso. The EEG was further depressed by ischemia under all anesthetic conditions. Neurologic outcome was evaluated for 3 days following incomplete cerebral ischemia by using a graded deficit score (0 = normal, 5 = death associated with stroke). Following moderate ischemia all four anesthetic treatments improved outcome compared with N2O controls, but after severe ischemia only 2 MAC iso significantly improved outcome. Neurohistopathology was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 40, 24 h after ischemia. The neurohistopathology score was significantly improved by all four anesthetic treatments compared with N2O following moderate ischemia and was better with 2 MAC iso compared with 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 metho after both moderate and severe ischemia. These results show that both iso and metho improve outcome from cerebral ischemia compared with that associated with N2O, but only 2 MAC iso resulted in an improved outcome following severe ischemia. This difference in outcome between the two anesthetics may be related to greater neuronal depression with iso, which may occur with little difference in cerebral metabolic depression.\r"

The number of viable cells of 5-day cultured lymphocytes stimulated with OVA was increased by an additional three days incubation with recombinant IL2. This phenomenon was not observed when the lymphocytes of patients allergic to OVA but not to Dermatophagoides farinae extract antigen (Df) were stimulated with Df. Normal lymphocytes stimulated with OVA expressed Tac antigen (low affinity IL2 receptor) but, in contrast to those from the allergic patients, did not absorb nor respond to IL2. The induction of OVA-specific IL2 responsiveness in patient lymphocytes was markedly suppressed on the addition of culture supernatant from OVA-stimulated normal T cells, but Df-specific IL2 responsiveness of the lymphocytes from Df-sensitized patients with bronchial asthma was not suppressed by the same supernatant. The supernatant of lymphocytes from allergic patients did not show such suppressive effect. The patient lymphocytes whose IL2 responsiveness was suppressed with the supernatant from normal lymphocytes still expressed Tac antigen. These observations suggest that the culture supernatant of normal T lymphocytes stimulated with OVA contained an antigen-specific factor suppressing the induction of IL2 responsiveness of OVA-stimulated patient lymphocytes. The production of such a suppressive factor was impaired in the patient, and further, the factor may have inhibited the triggering signal of IL2 receptors having absorbed IL2. The existence of some allogeneic barrier between the factor(s) and patient lymphocytes was suggested, since the supernatant from OVA-stimulated normal T cells did not necessarily suppress the response of all patients tested.\r"

Uptake of 3H-thymidine was evaluated at 72 hours of culture. An inhibitory effect was observed with morphine, ACTH, and substance P while stimulatory effects were seen with vasoactive intestinal peptide, both in normal and in allergic subjects.

The study showing improved survival with rapid manual CPR empirically included treatment with bicarbonate and initial fluid loading. To determine the role of bicarbonate and fluid loading in the success of rapid manual chest compression CPR, 31 mongrel dogs were studied. After instrumentation with micromanometer-tipped catheters to measure aortic and right atrial pressures, the animals were assigned sequentially to three treatment groups. Group A underwent rapid manual chest compressions at 120 compressions/min, bicarbonate treatment, and initial fluid loading. Group B underwent rapid manual compressions at 120 compressions/min without bicarbonate or fluid loading. Group C underwent standard CPR at 80 compressions/min with bicarbonate and fluid loading. After 30 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, defibrillation was attempted. Seven of 11 dogs in group A survived 24 hours. None of the animals in group B resuscitated or survived. Three of the ten dogs in group C survived 24 hours. Survival with rapid manual CPR without bicarbonate and initial fluid loading was significantly less than when these interventions were used (P less than .01). To examine the separate contribution of bicarbonate and fluid therapy, two additional groups of animals were studied. Fourteen animals (group D) received rapid manual CPR with bicarbonate therapy, and 12 (group E) received rapid manual CPR with fluid loading only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A prospective, double-blinded study was designed to evaluate how frequency of dosing of an inhaled beta-agonist, metaproterenol (Alupent inhalation solution) would affect patient response, length of stay in the ED, and admission rates. Forty-one patients initially received a 0.3-mL dose of nebulized metaproterenol followed by two additional doses of either metaproterenol or saline every 20 minutes. While there was no difference in response (forced expiratory volume in one second) in patients at 30 minutes after their arrival, there was an improved response in the metaproterenol group at 60 and 120 minutes. The length of stay in the ED was approximately the same for both groups. There was no significant difference in admission rates. No increase in undesirable side effects (eg, nausea, tremor, palpitations) was seen in the metaproterenol-treated group. Frequent dosing of metaproterenol is useful in asthmatics having acute exacerbations and leads to rapid improvement without an increase in toxicity.\r"

In addition, risks of subclavian catheterization are not a factor in femoral vein catheterization. Few studies have compared the success rate for catheterization of one site with that of the other during cardiac arrest. We conducted a prospective study to compare the success and complication rates for femoral with those of subclavian vein catheterization. Ninety-four patients undergoing CPR had either femoral or subclavian vein catheters placed during the course of the arrest. Catheter placement was verified by injection of radiopaque contrast material. We found that the success rate for femoral catheterization was 77% compared with a success rate of 94% for subclavian vein catheterization (P less than .05). There were no instances of pneumothorax with subclavian vein catheterization. There was no apparent learning curve leading to an increased success rate during the course of the study. We conclude that femoral vein catheterization should not be used except in those instances where attempts at peripheral and central venous cannulation are unsuccessful.\r"

  ".W": "Serum drug levels from a single intraosseous attempt in nontraumatized bone have proven comparable to levels from IV drug infusions. However, in the clinical situation, inexperienced personnel may make multiple intraosseous attempts, which could allow significant extravasation from multiple intramedullary entrance sites. Serum drug levels arising from multiple intraosseous attempts in traumatized bone were compared with those arising from single intraosseous attempts in nontraumatized bone. We administered phenobarbital to 24 dogs randomly divided into single- (11) and multiple-attempt (13) groups. In the multiple-attempt group, we created three intramedullary insertion sites in a linear fashion and infused through only the central site. In the single-attempt group, only a single infusion site was created. Phenobarbital then was infused into the intramedullary space, and central venous phenobarbital samples were collected at one-, three-, six-, and ten-minute intervals. The single-attempt group attained significantly higher serum phenobarbital levels at each interval compared with the multiple-attempt group (P less than .0001). Therefore, to be an effective mode of therapy, it is critical to achieve single-attempt intraosseous needle placement for intraosseous infusion.\r"

Multiple rhythm disturbances, including profound bradycardia, occurred. She required endotracheal intubation, external chest compressions, and application of a transcutaneous pacemaker. Paced cardiac contractions produced a dramatic improvement in her blood pressure and clinical condition. Two empiric injections of digoxin-specific FAB antibody fragments were administered, after which cardiac function and rhythm gradually improved. She was discharged in her normal state of health three days later. Yew leaves and berries contain several alkaloids that can produce fatal conduction disturbances. Transcutaneous cardiac pacemakers may be lifesaving for patients with transient cardiac toxicity from drug or toxin ingestions. In addition, cross-reactivity between digoxin-specific FAB antibodies and the alkaloids in the yew plant may exist and may have therapeutic importance, although this mechanism was unlikely to have helped our patient.\r"

A serum level of 4.4 mg/L (13.64 mumol/L) was obtained after the infant ingested only one tablet (300 mg). This establishes a new minimal lethal dose/blood level for children. Although some pediatric and adult pharmacokinetic and clinical similarities exist, the outcome is different. Pediatric mortality is 80%, whereas adult mortality is only 10%. Pediatric ingestion cases are primarily unintentional, and most adult cases are suicide attempts. Current treatment in adults includes a protocol of diazepam and epinephrine. Further studies involving children and these medications and other modalities are needed to improve survival.\r"

Adequate anesthesia of facial and scalp wounds was achieved for 81% of TAC-treated wounds versus 87% of lidocaine-treated wounds (P = .005). TAC was less effective on extremity wounds; 43% had effective anesthesia compared with 89% of lidocaine-treated extremity wounds (P less than .0001). No systemic toxicity was observed. The incidence of wound infection was 2.2% for both TAC and lidocaine. Wound dehiscence occurred in seven TAC- and two lidocaine-treated facial or scalp wounds (4.5% vs 1.8%, NS) and in five TAC- and four lidocaine-treated extremity wounds (20% vs 17.4%, NS). The unusually high rate of dehiscence was due partially to recurrent trauma or coincident infection. TAC was well accepted by patients and parents. We encourage the careful use of TAC as a less painful alternative to lidocaine infiltration for selected scalp and facial lacerations in children.\r"

The objective of the course was to provide information regarding the dynamics and prevention of motor vehicle crashes. An equally important second objective was to demonstrate to the residents the need for emergency physicians as part of the injury control research team. The content of the course was based on the conceptual model in which a motor vehicle crash is analyzed in terms of precrash, crash, and post-crash factors. The correlation between the mechanism of injury and the types of injuries experienced was of particular interest. A one-day format was found to be too concentrated. The incorporation of injury prevention concepts and research methods into the grand rounds, journal club, and conferences of the emergency medicine residency is recommended. Educational objectives and practical suggestions for implementation are provided. A comprehensive reading list is available on request.\r"

As a disease process, injuries are amenable to evaluation with epidemiologic tools and subject to prevention by modifying the transmission of energy to human beings. This may occur by either active or passive means of intervention. Physician leadership in the prevention of injuries is important, yet few physicians have training in injury control. The concepts of injury control are presented by defining the components that create injury and by examining the factors that affect each component. Strategies for identifying countermeasures are described and the merits of each of the applications of countermeasures are discussed. The physician must understand these basic concepts of injury control to an effective leader in developing strategies that mitigate injury in the community.\r"

A left lateral thoracotomy was performed, and the proximal left anterior descending artery was ligated. After ten minutes of myocardial ischemia, ventricular fibrillation was obtained by application of 6-V AC. Mechanical ventilation was stopped. Total arrest time was ten minutes. All animals were randomized into one of five resuscitation protocols; each protocol was identical except for the dose and route of epinephrine administration. Group 1 animals comprised the control group and received normal saline. Group 2 and 3 animals received epinephrine in doses of 0.014 mg/kg by central venous and intracardiac injection, respectively. Group 4 and 5 animals received epinephrine in doses of 0.071 mg/kg by central venous and intracardiac injection, respectively. None of the dogs receiving normal saline had a return of spontaneous circulation, defined as a spontaneous systolic blood pressure of more than 50 mm Hg. Nine of the ten animals from groups 2 and 3 and all of the ten animals from groups 4 and 5 had a return of spontaneous circulation. However, animals receiving the standard dose of epinephrine had a significantly longer resuscitation time compared with the high-dose group (P = .05) and required more doses of epinephrine for successful resuscitation than did animals receiving high doses (P less than .02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We present a rabbit model of PHT based on platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid autacoid synthesized by a variety of mammalian cells. PAF was intravenously infused into rabbits for 4 wk. After the infusion, rabbits underwent pulmonary arterial catheterization for hemodynamic evaluation, and lung tissue was morphometrically analyzed for changes in cross-sectional areas of intima and media, and alteration in number of small pulmonary arteries. The heart was evaluated by the method of Fulton for right ventricular hypertrophy. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 20 +/- 2 mm Hg in PAF-treated rabbits compared with 12 +/- 1 mm Hg in vehicle-treated control rabbits. PAF induced a trend toward loss of small muscular pulmonary arteries, measuring 50 to 200 microns in diameter, and right ventricular hypertrophy. There was a decrease in circumference of the internal elastic lamina in vessels accompanying alveolar ducts and in alveolar walls, and a relative increase in the intimal cross-sectional area of these vessels. These lesions were associated with a trend toward medial hypertrophy. No increase in lung water was found. Pressure changes occurred in the absence of alterations in hematocrit and arterial partial pressure of oxygen. We conclude that chronic intravenous infusion of PAF, a naturally synthesized substance, into rabbits provides a potentially useful model for the study of vascular changes associated with PHT.\r"

The effect of chemical modifications of the surface of alpha-quartz on the development of lung disease has been investigated by treating quartz with various organosilanes. The functional groups attached to the quartz surfaces were (-CN), (-CH3), (-NH2), and -(N(CH3)3+). After intratracheal injection of each modified crystal at a constant surface area into mice, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were assessed 6 wk postexposure to the crystals by lung wet weight (lung index) and by the level of hydroxyproline in the lung. The crystals showing the highest degree of biologic activity were native quartz, which has a negative charge, -N(CH3)3+ modified quartz, which has a positive charge, and -CN modified quartz, which has no charge. One of the crystals with chemical groups capable of hydrogen bonding, the -NH2 modified quartz, was as unreactive as the crystal preparation modified with a hydrophobic group, -CH3. If the -CH3 and -NH2 modified quartz are compared as a less reactive group with the more reactive native quartz and -N(CH3)3+ modified quartz, these experiments suggest that electrostatic interactions may be more important in determining effective biologic activities than are hydrogen bonding interactions.\r"

Furthermore, the question of the clinical value of BALF-ACE determinations in in interstitial lung diseases or any of its subgroups was addressed. The study population consisted of 222 patients, 69 with biopsy proven sarcoidosis, 3 with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 4 with acute histoplasmosis, 27 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 4 with rheumatoid arthritis-related interstitial fibrosis, 9 with pulmonary drug toxicity, 16 with pulmonary malignancies, 26 with other parenchymal lung disease entities, and 30 in whom the final diagnosis remained indeterminate. Elevated BALF-ACE concentrations were seen in all diagnostic categories. In sarcoidosis BALF-ACE levels correlated well with lavage lymphocyte counts (r = 0.49; p less than 0.0001), in contrast to IPF where they correlated well with lavage neutrophil counts (r = 0.51; p less than 0.007). The correlation of BALF-ACE and serum-ACE was significant. In sarcoidosis the mean BALF-ACE level was lower for patients with Stage-I chest roentgenographic patterns (0.664 U/L), compared to those with Stage II (1.112 U/L) and Stage III (1.083 U/L). It was concluded that elevated BALF-ACE levels are not specific for sarcoidosis. The correlations of BALF-ACE levels with different cellular constituents of BALF suggest a different cellular origin of BALF-ACE. In sarcoidosis BALF-ACE levels correlate well with other proposed markers of disease activity and seem to reflect pulmonary activity better than serum ACE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic inflammatory interstitial lung disease characterized by the accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract, parenchymal cell injury, and fibrosis of the alveolar structure. Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are claimed to be a major cause of tissue damage in IPF; however, the source of ROI has not been unequivocally identified. AMs, as well as neutrophils, are capable of releasing these agents. The contributions of these possible sources are not known. To address this question, we evaluated the spontaneous and stimulated (PMA or zymosan) ROI release of total bronchoalveolar cells and isolated AMs in 14 patients with IPF by means of luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 17 individuals without any signs of inflammation served as controls. In comparison with the controls, the spontaneous as well as the stimulated ROI release of total BAL cells in IPF are markedly increased (20,763.9 +/- 5,079.3 versus 2,509.5 +/- 300.6 counts/10 s/2.10(5) cells, spontaneously, IPF versus control; 106,819.3 +/- 33,802.8 versus 8,919 +/- 1,357.9 PMA induced; 41,597.1 +/- 8,442.6 versus 6,223.8 +/- 1,025.1 zymosan induced, p less than 0.001). Measurement of the ROI release of purified AMs revealed that these cells produce the bulk part of ROI released by BAL cells (84%). In spite of the fact that, on a per cell basis, the ROI release of neutrophils is 1.7-fold of that of AMs, there is no correlation between the ROI production of total BAL cells and the percentage of neutrophils in BAL, demonstrating a minor role of these cells in the generation of the total ROI burden in IPF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have examined superoxide anion (O2-) release by alveolar inflammatory cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from the lower respiratory tract of 10 healthy nonsmokers and 25 nonsmoking pneumoconiotic patients, 11 with radiographic changes of simple pneumoconiosis (SP) and 14 with changes of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Significant increased number of cells was recovered from the lower respiratory tract from both patients with SP or with PMF. Alveolitis was made up predominantly of alveolar macrophages (AM) and an increased percentage of neutrophils in patients with PMF (3.3 +/- 0.7%). O2- release was evaluated using a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence method. Spontaneous O2- generation by alveolar inflammatory cells from pneumoconiotic patients with SP was three to four times greater than that from 10 age-matched, healthy control subjects. O2- release by alveolar inflammatory cells from patients with PMF was dramatically increased when compared with that in patients with SP and with that in control subjects and was observed before and after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (p less than 0.001). The increased O2- release was not due to a lack of enzyme antioxidant system within AM since intracellular superoxide dismutase was not lower in AM from patients than in AM from control subjects (p less than 0.05). Alteration of DLCO correlated with PMA-induced superoxide release by alveolar inflammatory cells in patients with PMF (p less than 0.05). Our data demonstrate that alveolar inflammatory cells from pneumoconiotic patients with PMF are in the activated state and release more oxygen-reactive species that do those from patients with SP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A common finding in oxidant-induced organ injury is loss of vascular endothelial cell (EC) integrity and subsequent leak. The mechanisms involved are unclear, but maintenance of EC structure and functional integrity is highly dependent on the EC energy level. This study investigates whether oxidant-induced EC injury and concomitant increased monolayer permeability correlate with decreased energy levels. Rabbit pulmonary microvascular EC in vitro were exposed to varying levels of glucose oxidase as an oxidant-generating source for 2 h. Permeability changes were determined by albumin-Evans blue dye exclusion by monolayers of EC. ATP (nm/10(6) cells) and energy charge [ATP + 1/2ADP/(ATP + ADP + AMP)] were determined by HPLC. ATP and energy charge were found to decrease as permeability increased in response to increasing glucose oxidase concentration. ATP levels were a significantly more sensitive predictor of increased permeability than was energy charge. At 24 h, both permeability and ATP levels returned toward baseline. It appears that cell energy charge is preserved despite significant increases in monolayer permeability.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory and skeletal (deltoid) muscle strength were evaluated in 34 oral steroid-dependent asthmatics by use of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and a myometer. The patients were compared to age- and sex-matched asthmatics who had never been on continuous oral steroid treatment. Endurance time was also studied in ten steroid-dependent asthmatics and ten controls using a pressure threshold breathing device. Nutritional status was assessed from body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold (TSF), prealbumin, albumin, and total protein. An open biopsy from deltoid muscle was taken from nine steroid-dependent asthmatics and the diameter of type 1 and type 2 fibers was measured by a morphometric study. No differences were found between study and control groups either in respiratory and skeletal muscle strength or in endurance time. Steroid-dependent asthmatics showed a decrease in TSF, total protein, albumin, and potassium serum levels when compared with the control group but differences were not statistically significant after Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparison studies. Transversal diameter of type 2 fibers was significantly correlated with the percentage of ideal weight (r = 0.75 p less than 0.05), but not with average daily dose of steroids nor with the length of steroid treatment. Our results support the clinical impression that steroids, at the doses usually administered in chronic severe asthma, do not cause muscular weakness. We also found that malnutrition rather than corticosteroids is the most important contributory factor to type 2 muscle fiber atrophy in steroid-dependent asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Fasted mice exposed to 100% oxygen have more lung damage and die sooner than do fed mice. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon has not been identified. We performed the following experiments to test the hypothesis that reduced glutathione content in lung tissue of fasted mice contributes to the increased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung damage. First, air-exposed mice were fasted for as long as 3 days. They had little change in lung levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase, but they had a 41% decrease in glutathione by Day 3 (p less than 0.001). Second, fed mice and fasted mice were exposed to 100% oxygen for as long as 4 days. Both groups had nearly identical values of lung SOD and catalase, but the fasted mice had lower levels of glutathione (p less than 0.001). Third, fed mice received the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 20 mM) in their drinking water for 2 wk and were then exposed to either air or 100% oxygen. Air-exposed mice receiving BSO for 14 days had no change in lung SOD content, a 43% increase in catalase (p less than 0.001), and a 41% decrease in glutathione (p less than 0.01). Oxygen-exposed, BSO-treated mice had no change in SOD and an increase in catalase, but lower glutathione levels, more deaths, and increased lung damage on Day 3 (BAL protein: 1.72 +/- 0.21 versus 0.94 +/- 0.08 mg/ml; p less than 0.01) than did diluent-treated mice. Fourth, fasted mice were given liposomes containing glutathione intratracheally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of the heart on regional ventilation, Krypton-81m (81mKr) tomographic (SPECT) ventilation scans were recorded in seven patients with cardiomegaly and four normal subjects in the supine and prone positions. All patients had a cardiothoracic ratio of greater than 0.50 and clear lung fields radiographically. Using standard gamma camera tomographic reconstruction techniques, images of transaxial slices were obtained during a 360 degree rotation around the thorax of the subject breathing the radioactive gas 81mKr. The transaxial images, acquired over 10 min were aligned in each posture at the level of the cardiac apex, mid-heart, and aortic arch and were matched in relation to a radioactive marker on the chest wall and to anatomic landmarks. A horizontal line (gravity independent and parallel to the couch) was drawn on the transaxial section through the dorsal regions of the right and left lung. Counts per resolution element (12 to 15 mm) were plotted along this line and the ratios of the peak values in right and left lung compared. These ratios represent differences in regional ventilation per unit lung volume. In controls the mean left-to-right (L/R) peak count ratio varied from 0.91 to 1.00 at the three levels (range: 0.76 to 1.04); there were no significant differences between supine and prone. In patients with cardiomegaly the mean (+/- SEM) L/R peak count ratio at cardiac apex, mid-heart, and aortic arch was 0.46 (+/- 0.08), 0.55 (+/- 0.07), and 0.89 (+/- 0.08) when supine and 1.04 (+/- 0.07), 1.05 (+/- 0.05), and 1.08 (+/- 0.07) when prone, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of corticosteroid administration for 2 weeks on diaphragm histology, biochemistry, and function were assessed in the rabbit at rest and during inspiratory loading to respiratory failure, and compared to the extensor digitorum longus and untreated control animals. There were marked pathologic changes in the diaphragm after corticosteroid administration and significant alterations in diaphragm glycogen level (118.7 +/- 2.8 versus 56.2 +/- 1.0 mmol/kg wet weight, p less than 0.01) and lactate level (5.3 +/- 0.3 versus 3.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/kg wet weight, p less than 0.01) with only minimal changes in the skeletal muscle. Although respiratory muscle endurance in the control group increased from 142 +/- 17 min at baseline to 155 +/- 20 at Week 1 and 183 +/- 13 at Week 2 (p less than 0.05), it fell progressively from 135 +/- 19 min at baseline to 99 +/- 5 at Week 1 and 88 +/- 9 at Week 2 (p less than 0.01) in the corticosteroid-treated animals. On the other hand, there was no significant change in resting Pdimax after corticosteroid administration. In addition, there was no significant change in Pdimax, Pdi/Edi ratio, or glycogen level at the point of respiratory failure, but diaphragm lactate levels were increased (8.5 +/- 0.8 versus 5.3 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.05). When variable degrees of diaphragm dysfunction were induced by phrenic nerve pacing and/or thoracoabdominal binding, the degree of biochemical change associated with diaphragm dysfunction was significantly greater in corticosteroid-treated animals. We conclude that corticosteroid administration in the rabbit alters diaphragm histopathology and biochemistry as well as respiratory muscle endurance, but not strength.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bronchodilators are used widely in the acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although their effectiveness is not clearly established. We used three bronchodilators in 20 patients with COPD who were being mechanically ventilated. Two of the bronchodilators, ipratropium bromide and salbutamol, were administered from metered-dose inhalers (MDI) through an adapter to the endotracheal tube, and the third, aminophylline, was administered in the form of intravenous infusion. Before administering each drug, peak airway pressure, end-inspiratory pressure, resistive pressure, and auto positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) were measured, and inspiratory resistance (Rins) and compliance were calculated. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure were also recorded, and arterial pH and blood gas determinations were made. These measurements were repeated 60 min after the administration of aminophylline, 15 and 60 min after administering salbutamol, and 30 and 60 min after administering ipratropium bromide. With these three drugs, airway pressures were reduced, as well as auto-PEEP and Rins, with respect to basal values (p less than 0.05). The changes in compliance were only significant with salbutamol (p less than 0.05). HR was only significantly modified with aminophylline (p less than 0.05). No blood gas change was observed with any of the three drugs. It can be concluded that: (1) the three drugs used in this study were equally effective in producing significant bronchodilation in patients on mechanical ventilation for severe acute exacerbation of COPD; (2) the administration of bronchodilators by MDI in intubated patients through a special adapter was as effective as the intravenous administration of aminophylline.\r"
