  ".W": "These experiments examined the effects of intrathecally administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists on the effects of intrathecally administered excitatory amino acid (EAA) agonists: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), quisqualic acid and kainic acid. We have found that muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, but not baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, dose-dependently inhibited caudally directed biting and scratching behavior induced by all three EAA agonists. This nonselective blockade of the expression of effects mediated by all three types of EAA receptor is in marked contrast to the selective blockade of NMDA effects seen previously in the case of mu opioids and phencyclidine receptor agonists. Inhibition by muscimol was blocked with the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Decreased latency or hyperalgesia in the tail-flick test, found previously to be induced selectively by NMDA and blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist, was similarly affected by muscimol but not baclofen, each given intrathecally. However, muscimol prolonged the tail-flick latency only after presentation of NMDA suggesting a possible antinociceptive effect of GABAA agonists in the presence of agonists at NMDA receptors. This study together with the preceding paper resolves GABA-mediated spinal antinociception into two components: a GABAA agonist selectively blocks nociception involving EAA receptors whereas a GABAB agonist selectively blocks substance P spinal activity (the preceding paper).\r"

  ".W": "The sigma binding site in brain has affinity for psychotomimetic opioids, phencyclidine (PCP) and antipsychotic drugs, and is a separate entity from the PCP receptor. In order to demonstrate a behavioral correlate of sigma binding, rats were trained to discriminate between s.c. injections of saline and 3.0 mg/kg of ditolylguanidine (DTG), a selective and high affinity sigma ligand, and tested for generalization to novel drugs. The rats generalized dose dependently and completely or almost completely to PCP and related drugs and to mu, kappa and sigma opioid agonists. A separate group of rats trained to discriminate saline from 2.0 mg/kg of PCP generalized completely to DTG, confirming the commonalities in the discriminative effects of these drugs. DTG-like discriminative effects of opioid enantiomers showed no consistent stereoselectivity. Discriminative effects of the DTG training dose were neither mimicked by haloperidol and (-)-butaclamol, which have high affinity for the sigma site, or by the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Order of potency in producing DTG-like discriminative effects did not correlate with published reports of relative drug affinity for the sigma site or the PCP receptor. Although the discriminative effects of DTG have commonalities with those of several types of opioid and PCP-like drugs, their pharmacologic characteristics are different from the pharmacologic characteristics of opioid and PCP receptors as well as from those of the sigma binding site.\r"

  ".W": "Brain catecholamines may play a role in the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). To investigate central dopaminergic function in this strain, the effect of various dopaminergic drugs on open-field activity was assessed. In general, basal levels of ambulation were similar in SHRs and their controls, the Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Exploratory rearing activity was increased in SHRs, however. Haloperidol inhibited open-field ambulation in SHRs and WKY, but higher doses were needed in the SHR. Apomorphine inhibited ambulatory activity in WKY but had virtually no effect in SHRs. Amphetamine and the dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR-12909 increased ambulation in SHRs and WKY to a similar extent. Central administration of haloperidol or sulpiride decreased ambulatory activity in WKY, but had no effect in SHRs at the doses used. SCH-23390 decreased ambulation scores both in SHRs and WKY, with the effect being slightly greater in the latter strain. In all cases exploratory rearing was affected as well by the drugs used. The large difference in base-line scores has to be taken into account when interpreting these data, however. Also, for comparison the noradrenergic drugs clonidine and desipramine were tested. Both elicited decreases in activity which were identical in SHRs and WKY. These results show that a number of dopaminergic drugs have differential effects on open-field activity of SHRs as compared to WKY. Ambulatory activity appeared more resistant to inhibition in SHRs than in WKY. The possibility that these results could reflect altered dopaminergic function in SHR involved in the development of hypertension in this strain is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The behavioral effects of phencyclidine (PCP) were compared with those of several compounds known to antagonize the actions of N-methyl-D-aspartate using two patterns of schedule-controlled responding in rats. Rates of variable interval responding suppressed by punishment were increased greatly by the benzodiazepine chlorodiazepoxide and showed small increases after MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine] . However, no consistent increases in response rates were produced by PCP, by the stereoisomers of N-allylnormetazocine (NANM: SKF 10,047) or by the anti-ischemic drug, ifenprodil. Small doses of PCP did increase rates of unpublished variable interval responding, as did a low dose of MK-801. Timing behavior maintained by a differential reinforcement of low rate schedule was disrupted by all the compounds studied. Response rates were increased by at least one dose of PCP, MK-801, (+)-NANM and 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid. The effect of MK-801, however, was considerably greater than that of the other compounds. Ifenprodil and (-)-NANM did not increase rates of responding but, at high doses, produced decreases in reinforcement frequency indicating that efficient timing behavior had been disrupted. These results show that although PCP, MK-801 and (+)-NANM produce generally similar behavioral effects, there may also be some differences between the compounds, notably a more consistent effect of MK-801 on punished responding. These behavioral effects may be related to antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate but ifenprodil, which is also an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, does not show a similar behavioral profile.\r"

  ".U": "89199498\r", 
  ".W": "The pharmacological profile of the receptor mediating inhibitory effects of dopamine (DA) in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) was characterized using extracellular single unit recording and microiontophoretic techniques. Iontophoretic application of DA inhibited 65% of spontaneously active cells in the deep layers of the PFC, while producing little effect on cells in superficial laminae. The D2 selective antagonist, sulpiride, specifically attenuated DA-induced inhibition of deep layer PFC neurons, without blocking the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or serotonin (5-HT). Surprisingly, sulpiride antagonism did not appear to be stereospecific, as both its (-)- and (+)-isomers proved equally effective at blocking the inhibitory effects of DA. In contrast to sulpiride, the D1 selective antagonist, SCH23390, was much less effective at attenuating inhibitory responses to DA. The effects of selective agonists also were examined on DA-sensitive PFC neurons. The D2 selective agonist, LY171555, and the D1 selective agonist, SKF38393, produced inhibitory effects on a small number of DA-sensitive PFC neurons. However, the majority of cells tested were inhibited only by DA and not by LY171555 or SKF38393. In addition, coiontophoresis of LY171555 and SKF38393. In addition, coiontophoresis of LY171555 and SKF38393 failed to inhibit the majority of DA-sensitive PFC cells tested. LY171555, but not SKF38393, significantly attenuated DA-induced inhibition when applied simultaneously, suggesting that the D2 selective agonist might possess partial agonist/weak antagonist activity at this receptor. These results indicate that the receptor mediating the inhibitory effects of DA in the medial PFC has the pharmacological characteristics of a D2 subtype. However, this receptor may not be identical to D2 sites in other brain regions.\r"

The metabolism of cyclosporine was altered by coadministering phenobarbital and cimetidine as metabolism inducing and inhibiting agents, respectively. We found that phenobarbital depressed the immunosuppressive potency of cyclosporine by enhancing its metabolism resulting in lower cyclosporine blood levels. On the other hand, when cimetidine was administered concurrently with cyclosporine, the immunosuppressive effect was enhanced due to inhibition of the metabolism of cyclosporine which produced higher cyclosporine blood levels. When graft survival was evaluated relative to blood cyclosporine concentrations, however, it appeared that cimetidine had a direct negative effect on the survival of transplanted organs independent and contrary to its effect on the accumulation of cyclosporine. The immunosuppression produced by cyclosporine at these elevated blood levels was less than expected. The accrued data support the conclusion that cyclosporine and not its metabolites are primarily responsible for its immunosuppressive activity in the mouse.\r"

After acquisition of the discrimination (average, 127 sessions), the monkeys were tested with a series of compounds selected to characterize the neuronal mechanism(s) of the discrimination. AMPH (0.08-2.6 mumol/kg), cocaine (0.06-1.0 mumol/kg; n = 4), the dopamine (DA) uptake inhibitor bupropion (0.25-2.0 mumol/kg; n = 2) and the norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor nisoxetine (1.0-16 mumol/kg; n = 4) produced dose-related increases in the percentage of responses that occurred on the AMPH-appropriate lever during test sessions in all monkeys tested. For all other drugs tested, individual differences in effects were noted. Compounds with primarily D2 DA receptor activity, including apomorphine (0.06-1.0 mumol/kg; n = 4), piribedil (0.25-8.0 mumol/kg; n = 4), bromocriptine (0.12-1.0 mumol/kg; n = 4) and propylbutyldopamine (0.25-4.0 mumol/kg; n = 3) occasioned AMPH-appropriate responding in one or two monkeys. The D1 agonist SKF 38393 (0.5-64 mumol/kg; n = 4) and pentobarbital (4.0-32 mumol/kg; n = 4) substituted for AMPH in only one monkey. In tests for antagonism, the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.015-0.03 mumol/kg; n = 2) blocked completely the discriminative stimulus effects of AMPH in a dose-related manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty rats, trained to lever-press for food reinforcement, were tested under a modified Geller-Seifter procedure using a multiple schedule with responding in one component reinforced under a fixed-interval 60-sec schedule while each response in the other component resulted in both food and brief electric shock presentation. Chlordiazepoxide, PCP, etoxadrol, (+)-N-allylnormetazocine and (-)-beta-cyclazocine all resulted in selective increases in rates of responding during the punishment component. Two drugs with predominant opiate-agonist actions in vivo, (-)-alpha-cyclazocine and morphine, did not increase punished responding at any dose tested. These results confirm previous research using pigeons that had shown antipunishment effects of PCP and provide further evidence for an overlap in the pharmacology of PCP-like drugs and depressant drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The concordance between the discriminative stimulus properties and antipunishment effects of PCP-like drugs and actions at the PCP receptor suggests that the PCP receptor may play a role in both behavioral actions of this group of drugs.\r"

Although the extent of rationing is uncertain, it is an everyday occurrence in some hospitals and is likely to occur at least some of the time in many hospitals. Substantial evidence suggests that current rationing practices are highly subjective and perhaps inequitable. Critical care is widely believed to be beneficial to many patients, despite a striking dearth of supportive data. Since this type of care is being inequitably denied to some patients, hospitals should either adopt formal rationing guidelines or, alternatively, they should take clear steps to avoid rationing by altering the supply of or the demand for critical care. Reasonable arguments are presented in support of both approaches, as are suggestions for their implementation.\r"

  ".W": "In eight patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, we performed autograft transplantation of adrenal medulla to the head of the caudate nucleus. Our technique was similar to that developed by Madrazo and co-workers in Mexico City. No major perioperative complications occurred except for somnolence in one patient for 8 days postoperatively. The follow-up period has been at least 6 months in seven of the patients, and only limited benefit has been apparent. The early morning Parkinson examination score in the \"off\" (unmedicated) state was significantly improved in one patient and slightly better in the other six. Diary card entries suggested a mild trend toward improvement (not statistically significant). Four of the seven patients were taking less levodopa 6 months after the operation than they had been preoperatively; three of five patients were no longer taking dopamine agonists postoperatively. We cannot exclude a placebo effect contributing to any of this improvement. A reduction in medication-induced dyskinesia was also noted, but this result may have been due to adjustments in doses or a slightly less potent effect of medication (or both factors). In summary, we have not yet been able to replicate the dramatic success reported for adrenal medullary transplantation by Madrazo's group, although our patients may have experienced mild to moderate improvement. We continue to maintain follow-up surveillance of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "As a result of recent advances in molecular genetics, carrier testing for cystic fibrosis (CF) is now available as a clinical assay in a limited number of laboratories. Because neither the gene nor the mutation for this disorder has yet been defined, the analysis relies on an indirect approach that uses DNA sequence polymorphisms and linkage analysis. With use of this general approach, several family members, in addition to those persons seeking carrier information, must be tested. Currently, more than 97% of families are \"fully informative\" when these markers are used in a linkage analysis; thus, the carrier status of most persons who have a relative with CF can be determined. Recently, strong linkage disequilibrium has been shown between two polymorphic loci (defined by the DNA probes KM.19 and XV-2c) and the CF locus. Because of this important finding, haplotype testing can be used in many clinical settings, such as for families in which a DNA sample is not available from the affected person or for those families in which one spouse has no family history of CF and the other is either affected or is at a high risk of carrying the CF mutation. Overall, the application of recombinant DNA techniques has greatly enhanced the ability to determine, with a high level of accuracy, the carrier status of those persons at risk for inheriting the CF mutation.\r"

Patient diagnosis, the presence of ascites, a preoperative prothrombin time greater than 15 seconds, and a multifactorial \"risk category\" were all predictive of intraoperative blood loss. A history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or an operation that involved the right upper abdominal quadrant was not predictive of intraoperative blood loss. Although CMV infection is common after liver transplantation, the prophylactic use of CMV antibody-negative blood products in CMV-negative recipients receiving a liver from a CMV-negative donor in our series was not associated with postoperative CMV infection. The transplantation of a liver positive for anti-hepatitis B core antigen was associated with subsequent hepatitis B surface antigen seroconversion in two of four cases. Transplantation of an ABO-incompatible liver and the presence of rouleaux observed in pretransplant blood compatibility testing were both associated with a significantly higher mortality. A careful review of laboratory data and medical records of patients undergoing liver transplantation should enhance the ability to modify the approach to the allocation of limited blood resources and the care and management of these patients.\r"

A majority are unassociated with any identifiable cause; a small but significant percentage are attributed to heritable disorders of either a Mendelian (single gene) or chromosomal nature. Drugs and environmental exposures are currently implicated in only a small percentage of affected pregnancies. Nevertheless, an awareness of the principles of teratogenesis, an appreciation for the role--though imprecise--of placental transfer and fetal drug disposition, and avoidance of known teratogens currently offers our best hope for the study and prevention of birth defects.\r"

While fertility of patients with autoimmune disorders is generally unimpaired, important exceptions exist. Recent data regarding the impact of intercurrent pregnancy upon women with SLE suggest that the overall course of this disorder is not affected. The impact of SLE and related autoimmune phenomena during pregnancy primarily relates to adverse fetal outcome. Pregnancy wastage is excessive, and premature delivery and poor fetal growth are commonly encountered. The occurrence of fetal complications correlates with the level of maternal disease activity and the presence of specific autoantibodies. Management of pregnancy complicated by SLE or the production of autoantibodies associated with poor reproductive outcome should be directed at maintaining maternal disease quiescence. The adverse effect of the maternal disorder on fetal growth and development far outweighs actual or theoretical risks attributable to maternal drug therapy.\r"

As such, we are presented with a diverse group of patients and antihypertensive therapy ideally should be individualized. In reality we are dealing with a complex situation because of the presence of the fetus raising concerns about direct effects on the fetus as well as on uteroplacental blood flow. This limits our choice of agents to those with extensive use in pregnancy except in complicated or resistant cases. For these reasons, hydralazine is the antihypertensive agent of choice for treatment of acute hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy. In the complicated case other agents such as sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin may be more appropriate and, in these cases, hemodynamic monitoring should be performed to allow not only greater safety, but also to tailor therapy to the individual hemodynamic profile.\r"

At some time during the study, 25 of the 56 podofilox treated patients and none of the 53 placebo group were completely wart-free. At the end of the treatment, 73.6% of the original warts in podofilox treated patients were gone compared with only 8.3% of those in the placebo group (mean percentage of total original wart area was reduced by 82.3% compared with 4.2%). 82% of the treated warts in the podofilox group and 13% in the placebo group had resolved at 6 weeks. Recurrence was observed in 34% of the previously resolved warts. Consistent with this rate of recurrence, new warts developed in a third of the subjects in each group at sites remote from the treatment site. There were no systemic adverse reactions, although transient inflammation, erosion, pain, and burning were common.\r"

Double-blind, placebo-controlled nasal challenge of 8 patients demonstrated that the upper airways of these patients were also sensitive to this dermatophyte antigen. In addition to perennial asthma most of the patients had persistent eosinophilia and chronic rhinosinusitis. The results suggest that absorption of fungal antigen can give rise to IgE antibody production, sensitisation of the airways, and symptomatic asthma and rhinosinusitis.

Its multifarious activities are mediated by two types of Fc receptors found on different cell populations, Fc epsilon R1 on mast cells and basophils, and Fc epsilon R2 on inflammatory cells (monocytes, eosinophils and platelets) and B lymphocytes. Recombinant epsilon-chain fragments synthesized in Escherichia coli have provided the means of mapping the receptor-binding sites on human IgE, and blocking IgE-receptor interactions. We have previously shown that the Fc epsilon R1 binding site is contained within a sequence (Gln 301-Arg 376) spanning the C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 domains. Here we show that Fc epsilon R2 can recognize a motif in the C epsilon 3 domain that is formed on dimerization of one or both of the flanking (C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 4) domains. Glycosylation of IgE is not required for the activity of either receptor.\r"

Here we report a third class of E. coli surface organelles for which we propose the name curli. Curli are coiled surface structures composed of a single type of subunit, the curlin, which differs from all known pilin proteins and is synthesized in the absence of a cleavable signal peptide. Although the gene encoding this structural subunit, crl, is present and transcribed in most natural isolates of E. coli, only certain strains are able to assemble the subunit protein into curli. This assembly process occurs preferentially at growth temperatures below 37 degrees C. The ability of curli to mediate binding to fibronectin may be a virulence-associated property for wound colonization and for the colonization of fibronectin-coated surfaces.\r"

The properties of microtubules are due, in part, to proteins other than tubulins that are part of, or interact with, microtubules and the identification and characterization of such proteins is important to understanding how microtubules function. Analyses of mutations at the mipA (microtubule interacting protein) locus of Aspergillus nidulans have suggested that the product of mipA interacts specifically, probably physically, with beta-tubulin in vivo and is involved in microtubule function. We have cloned and sequenced the wild-type mipA gene as well as complementary DNA copies of its messenger RNA. Comparisons of the predicted product of mipA with tubulins from diverse organisms reveal that mipA is a previously undiscovered member of the tubulin superfamily of genes; the only member yet discovered that does not encode alpha- or beta-tubulin. We propose that the product of mipA be called gamma-tubulin.\r"

  ".U": "89201587\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium deficiency causes osteoporosis in experimental animals because the skeleton is sacrificed for the preservation of the plasma (ionic) calcium and to meet obligatory calcium losses in the feces and urine. (Vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, causes rickets and osteomalacia largely because of the loss of the calcemic action of vitamin D, which leads to hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and hypophosphatemia.) The concept that human osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women, results from negative calcium balance represents a working hypothesis that fits many, but not all of the available data. In normal women, the crucial event is a rise in obligatory urinary calcium loss, which may result from an increase in the complexed fraction of the plasma calcium, due in turn to an increase in plasma bicarbonate. Prospective trials with calcium supplements have, however, yielded conflicting results. In osteoporotic women, a further increase in urinary calcium combined with calcium malabsorption produces a further increase in bone resorption, but some impairment of bone formation due to declining androgens may constitute an additional risk factor with advancing age. The suppressibility of urinary hydroxyproline by calcium supplementation in those patients who can absorb calcium, and by calcitriol in those who cannot, supports the calcium deficiency model, but more trials are needed to establish its validity.\r"

In four of the first six cases, the entire pregnancy was lost. Among the last 11 patients, on the other hand, no pregnancy was lost. All 11 women delivered healthy, viable infants; eight delivered at term and three delivered between 31-35 weeks.

Surgical treatments for these problems raise ethical as well as medical questions regarding patients whose prenatal diagnosis reveals congenital heart disease. We report six cases of in utero diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome and other complex congenital heart anomalies. Empirical factors relevant to our management were gestational age, severity of the anomaly, degree of certainty of diagnosis and prognosis, possibilities for treatment, and parental wishes regarding the fetus or newborn. Each of these factors was examined in the context of the reported cases and correlated with ethical principles applicable to obstetrics and neonatology: 1) respect for parental autonomy, 2) promotion of the infant's welfare, and 3) fairness in distributing scarce medical resources. We maintain that the first two principles are paramount in ethical decisions regarding individual patients, while the third is foremost in policy decisions affecting others as well.\r"

Three experienced ultrasonographers used a subjective scale to rate the oligohydramnios as mild, moderate, severe, or anhydramniotic. Interobserver reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.81). The overall perinatal mortality rate was 43%, and the incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia was 33%. One-third had lethal congenital anomalies. The frequency of adverse outcome correlated strongly with the most severe degrees of oligohydramnios; 88% of the fetuses with severe oligohydramnios or anhydramnios had lethal outcomes, compared with 11% in the mild/moderate group. The presence of an anuric urinary tract anomaly was associated with the most severe grades of oligohydramnios and was uniformly fatal. Pulmonary hypoplasia was diagnosed in 60% of the severe group versus 6% in the moderate group. We conclude that subjective grading of oligohydramnios by experienced observers is both reliable and predictive of outcome. The finding of severe oligohydramnios in the second trimester is highly predictive of poor fetal outcome and should stimulate a thorough search for etiology and consideration of intervention. Moderate grades of reduced amniotic fluid may be managed with relative optimism.\r"

Vaginal sonography provided more useful diagnostic information in 44% of the cases, 31% of the ectopics and 52% of the intrauterine pregnancies. Among the 39 ectopic gestations, vaginal scanning was more accurate than abdominal scanning in detecting the ectopic pregnancy (90 versus 80%) and cul-de-sac fluid (77 versus 46%), in identifying an ectopic gestational sac (69 versus 44%), and in diagnosing a tubal pregnancy as unruptured (76 versus 50%). Only one false-positive diagnosis was made by each method of scanning. Among the 61 intrauterine pregnancies, vaginal scanning allowed a more accurate detection of the content of the sac (fetus/yolk sac) in 49% of the cases. In two women, normal intrauterine sacs of 2 and 2.5 mm were detected only by vaginal scanning, at hCG levels of 740 and 840 IU/L (First International Reference Preparation), respectively. Vaginal scanning appears important for early diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy and more accurate diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

A moderately strong correlation (R = 0.61; P less than .01) was observed between the day of the salivary electrical resistance peak and that of the serum LH peak. However, the serum LH peak occurred between 4-9 days after an identified peak in salivary electrical resistance. Twice-daily urine LH testing correlated strongly with both the serum LH peak (R = 0.93; P = .0001) and the ultrasound-detected day of ovulation (R = 0.81; P = .0001). A statistically significant peak in the mean salivary or vaginal electrical resistance on a particular day relative to the day of the serum LH peak could not be demonstrated. When identified, the nadir in vaginal electrical resistance occurred no earlier than 2 days before the serum LH peak and thus may mark the endpoint of the fertile period for natural family planning methods. We conclude that, whereas the PEAK Ovulation Predictor is of little value in accurately predicting ovulation, measurements of salivary and vaginal electrical resistance may be helpful in timing inseminations. However, for detection of the serum LH surge, twice-daily urine LH testing demonstrated a stronger correlation and narrower frequency distribution than did those determinations based on electrical resistance.\r"

Basal levels of androstenedione and of total testosterone were significantly elevated, decreasing to normal ranges after operation and remaining after 3 months. There was a sharp increase of total testosterone, DHEAS, and dihydrotestosterone levels after administration of hCG.

No suppression of either steroid was produced by dexamethasone, whereas serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was suppressed from 5.2 to 1.9 micrograms/mL. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for a 3 x 4-cm Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor of intermediate differentiation. Intraoperative studies demonstrated that the tumor secreted testosterone, androstenedione, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and estradiol, but not dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. These findings support the thesis that hormonal manipulation tests cannot differentiate between adrenal and ovarian virilizing tumors. Nor does the oral contraceptive suppression of testosterone secretion exclude an ovarian malignancy. The patient remains free of recurrence after 7 years.\r"

Since 1959, three main modifications of the originally described procedure have emerged as representing various needle suspension procedures, ie, the modified Pereyra procedure among gynecologic surgeons and the Stamey and the Raz procedures among urologic surgeons. The overall success rate of 85% (range 40-100%) among a total of 1967 surgical procedures reported in the published literature may be misleading; the majority of reported studies relied upon subjective clinical cures rather than objectively demonstrable cures of urinary incontinence. The majority of studies lacked long-term follow-up of successfully treated patients. Few studies reported urodynamic changes after needle suspension procedures in terms of increased functional urethral length and improved pressure transmission to the proximal urethra. A 20-50% incidence of postoperative voiding difficulties has been reported in various studies. This publication reviews the controversies in the nomenclature of various needle suspension procedures, indication, suture materials, procedural details, and results of previously published needle suspension procedures and their modifications. Differences among commonly performed procedures are pointed out and analyzed for their role in the correction of stress urinary incontinence.\r"

  ".W": "Primary acquired melanosis (PAM), a disease that affects mostly middle-aged white patients, is predominantly a proliferative condition of the melanocytes that normally populate the conjunctival epithelium. Primary acquired melanosis without atypia (low risk for the development of melanoma) is typically created by increased numbers of melanocytes restricted to the basilar region of the epithelium without nuclear hyperchromasia or prominence of the nucleoli. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia, a formal precursor of melanoma, is characterized by the proliferation of small polyhedral cells, spindle cells, large dendritiform melanocytes, or epithelioid cells that may: remain restricted to the basilar region (basilar nests); form nests at all levels of the epithelium; spread individually to all levels of the epithelium (pagetoid extension); or proliferate in a sheet-like fashion approximating a melanoma in situ. Lesions composed of epithelioid cells or exhibiting intraepithelial pagetoid extension have, respectively, a 75 or 90% chance of eventuating in invasive melanoma. Primary acquired melanosis in an adult should not be confused with \"a junctional nevus,\" which is almost always restricted to childhood. Invasive melanomas measuring less than 0.8 mm in thickness tend not to be associated with metastases; the tumor cells may be small polyhedral (in which case confusion with a compound nevus often arises), epithelioid, spindled, or ballooned. Nodules composed of spindle cells in part or in toto tend to have less metastatic potential at a given thickness measurement than comparable nodules composed of epithelioid or polyhedral cells. The clinical features, electron microscopic findings, and biologic principles underwriting clinical management are also presented.\r"

  ".W": "Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is characterized by the deposition of immunoglobulin and complement along the conjunctival epithelial basement membrane zone (BMZ). In order to further elucidate the cellular populations of the local inflammatory infiltrates, the authors used a panel of monoclonal antibodies in cryostat tissue sections to delineate T cell subsets, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages in six patients with OCP. In comparison with matched controls of the epibulbar conjunctiva, the authors discovered a threefold increase in T lymphocytes within the epithelium and a 20-fold increase within the substantia propria. In contrast with the normal-standing population of conjunctival T lymphocytes, there were activated interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R)-positive lymphocytes in both the epithelium and the substantia propria. Macrophages were the second most common cells in the substantia propria, accounting for 12.7% of the mononuclear population--a threefold increase over the normal percentage. B cells and plasma cells, normally absent from epibulbar conjunctiva, were the next most prominent populations, constituting 6.9 and 4.6%, respectively, of all mononuclear cells. Dendritic cells which process antigen locally constituted only 1.2% of the mononuclear cell population, but were increased 25-fold over normal controls. By elaborating cytokines that promote fibroplasia, the T cells in OCP may be effector cells along with macrophages and other inflammatory cells in bringing about scarification of the substantia propria, and may furthermore be responsible for an immunoregulatory defect that allows local B lymphocytes to produce autoantibodies to the BMZ.\r"

  ".U": "89201897\r", 
  ".W": "It is claimed that postsurgical hearing preservation is possible in about 5 to 8 per cent of cases of acoustic neuroma. Even with small tumors, hearing preservation can be accomplished in about half of the patients who are fortunate to have anatomic integrity of facial and cochlear nerves, as well as intact inner ear blood supply at the end of the surgical procedure. Monitoring of seventh and eighth nerve function through evoked potentials may be important. On the other hand, even if evoked potentials are preserved during surgery with wave V latency and amplitude similar to preoperative recording, hearing may still be completely lost during the immediate postoperative period. There is no predictable pattern that assures postoperative preservation of hearing. In Case 2, the seventh and eighth nerves as well as the inner ear blood supply were carefully dissected and anatomically and electrophysiologically preserved during the intraoperative period. At the end of the surgical procedure, the evoked potentials were the same as preoperatively. Nevertheless, the patient ended up with no detectable hearing postoperatively. We feel that the suboccipital-retrosigmoid transcanal approach can be safely used for the removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors of all sizes. We believe the argument that \"only the translabyrinthine approach can accomplish total tumor removal\" is not valid. No complications have been attributed by having the patient in the semisitting position. Older patients, who cannot tolerate the semisitting position, are operated on while in the park bench position. Planned subtotal removal of a CPA tumor is done with the patient in the supine position (transmastoid-retrolabyrinthine or retrosigmoid). The relationship between the otologic surgeon and neurosurgeon is very important. The surgical approach used should be selected on the basis of the combined experience of the surgical team. Finally, an attempt should be made to preserve facial nerve function and hearing in all suitable patients. The postoperative course using the suboccipital-retrosigmoid approach is usually benign, and the patients are discharged from the hospital between 7 and 10 days following surgery. The translabyrinthine approach, in our opinion, should be reserved for smaller lesions in patients with anacusis or with residual hearing that is not worth saving.\r"

The patients were also randomized into three groups based on the duration of oral therapy: 500 patients were treated for 3 weeks; 350 for 5 weeks; and 250 for 8 weeks. When intramuscular aminoglycosides were used, streptomycin was given for 2 weeks and gentamicin for 5 days. In oral monotherapy oxytetracycline, doxycycline and rifampin showed comparable results with low relapse rates (less than or equal to 9%) and no statistically significant differences were found among 3-, 5- or 8-week durations of therapy. TMP/SMX alone showed an unacceptably high relapse rate (30%) with all durations of therapy. In combined oral therapy rifampin plus oxytetracycline, rifampin plus TMP/SMX and oxytetracycline plus TMP/SMX showed comparable results with low relapse rates ranging from 4 to 8% in patients receiving therapy for 3 or 5 weeks, no relapses occurred in patients treated for 8 weeks. When oral monotherapy was combined with either streptomycin or gentamicin, very few relapses were seen, irrespective of the duration of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight percent of all these women were seropositive. Seropositivity was unrelated to occupational group. Four of 235 women observed between 1983 and 1987 for a mean of 435 days/woman acquired B19 infections (an annual seroconversion rate of 1.5%). We investigated intrafamilial associations of B19 infection in a second group of 440 subjects from 111 families. Seropositivity of parents was not associated with seropositivity of their children. Seropositivity of one spouse was not associated with seropositivity of the cospouse. However, of 47 seropositive older siblings, 32 (68%) of their younger siblings were seropositive, compared to 20 (18%) seropositive younger siblings of 112 seronegative older siblings (P less than 0.001). B19 infections increased with age from 19% for those younger than 10 years to 67% for those older than 49 years. For all ages females had a higher rate (51%) of B19 infection than males (38%). These data suggest that children may be more susceptible to B19 than adults and B19 infections occur infrequently among women younger than 40 years of age. However, during local outbreaks the B19 infection rate for susceptible pregnant women remains unknown.\r"

The muscle GT-like protein is 65% identical in amino acid sequence to the rat brain GT and 52% identical to the rat liver GT; the major differences are in the NH2- and COOH-terminal hydrophilic segments. This GT-like mRNA is expressed predominately in tissues where glucose transport is sensitive to insulin, including striated muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue; low-level expression is also detected in smooth muscle and kidney mRNA.

The DHFR/G-8 cells exhibited normal morphology. Their growth curve was similar to that of NIH 3T3 cells but was different from that of the B104-1 cell, and NIH 3T3 transfectant that carries the activated neu oncogene. When injected into nude mice, B104-1 cells produced tumors within 2 weeks, whereas the DHFR/G-8 cells did not produce tumors until 3 months after injection, and the NIH 3T3 cells did not produce any tumors even after 3 months. The tumors produced by the injection of the DHFR/G-8 cells were excised and grown in culture. The cells derived from the tumors were of transformed morphology and highly tumorigenic. The DNAs from the tumor cells were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The transfection resulted in foci on the NIH 3T3 monolayer. Southern analysis indicated that the foci derived from the transfection contained the neu gene. Using oligonucleotides as probes, the neu gene in the foci was found to carry a single-point mutation identical to the one previously found in the rat neuroblastoma and glioblastoma induced by the ethylnitrosourea. We conclude that the DNA region encoding the transmembrane domain of neu is a hot spot for converting the proto-neu gene into an activated oncogene and that amplification of the proto-neu gene facilitates mutation of the hot spot.\r"

  ".W": "Cis- and trans-acting elements of the Escherichia coli lac operon were transferred to vaccinia virus and used to regulate gene expression. A recombinant virus that constitutively expresses a modified lac repressor gene (lacI) was constructed. We calculated that each infected cell contained approximately 2 x 10(7) active repressor molecules (and 1-2 x 10(4) copies of the vaccinia virus genome). A strong vaccinia-virus late promoter was modified by insertion of the lac operator (lacO) at various positions. The ability of each modified promoter to regulate expression of beta-galactosidase was tested by transient assays in cells infected with wild-type or lacI-containing vaccinia virus. Placement of the lacO just downstream of the conserved TAAAT sequence of a late promoter was consistent with a minimal effect on basal expression and good repressibility, whereas basal expression was severely inhibited when lacO overlapped or preceded the TAAAT motif. A single recombinant vaccinia virus containing lacI and the beta-galactosidase gene under control of the optimal lacO promoter was constructed. In the absence of inducer, cells infected with this double recombinant virus synthesized little or no detectable beta-galactosidase. Addition of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside restored expression to greater than 20% of the unrepressed level. This inducible vector system has potential applications for expression of heterologous and homologous genes.\r"

A recombinant baculovirus (3B6) carrying the human 5-lipoxygenase coding sequence downstream of the strong polyhedrin protein promoter was isolated. Approximately 48 hr after infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells with the recombinant baculovirus, maximal intracellular enzyme activity and protein levels were detected. The recombinant 5-lipoxygenase in 10,000 x g supernatant fractions was able to synthesize large amounts of 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid, together with smaller amounts of the nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4, and exhibited a dependence on Ca2+ and ATP for maximal activity. Immunoblot analysis of supernatant proteins from human leukocytes and recombinant virus-infected cells indicated the presence of indistinguishable approximately 80-kDa bands. However, 5-lipoxygenase protein in recombinant-infected cells was found to be present in amounts 50-200 times that present in leukocytes on a per-cell basis. Histidine-362 and histidine-372, potential iron-atom ligands within a putative iron-binding domain, were changed to serine residues. Recombinant baculoviruses carrying the mutations were isolated and used to infect insect cells. Although infected cells were able to express mutant 5-lipoxygenase protein, enzyme activity was not substantially altered, suggesting the nonessential nature of these histidines in binding iron at the putative ferric catalytic site.\r"

This activation increases the Vmax of hexose uptake and has little or no effect on the Km for deoxyglucose (Km = 1-2 mM). Activation by hormone requires about 60 min and is inhibited by cytochalasin B but not by cycloheximide. The dependence of hexose uptake rate on hexose concentration exhibits cooperativity with Hill coefficients of 1.8 and 1.4 for the basal and hormone-activated states, respectively. Microinjection of a monoclonal antibody directed against the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor blocks activation of hexose uptake by insulin-like growth factor I and insulin but has no effect on basal uptake. Taken together the results implicate the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of a cell-surface insulin-like growth factor I receptor in the activation of glucose transport in the Xenopus oocyte.\r"

  ".W": "Regulated transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires the functional interaction of multiple protein factors, some of which presumably interact directly with the polymerase. One such factor, the yeast GCN4 activator protein, binds to the upstream promoter elements of many amino acid biosynthetic genes and induces their transcription. Through the use of affinity chromatography involving GCN4- or Pol II-Sepharose columns, we show that GCN4 interacts specifically with Pol II in vitro. Purified Pol II is retained on the GCN4-Sepharose column under conditions in which the vast majority of proteins flow through. Moreover, Pol II can be selectively isolated from more complex mixtures of proteins. Conversely, GCN4 protein, synthesized in vitro or in Escherichia coli, specifically binds to the Pol II-Sepharose column under equivalent conditions. Using deletion mutants, we also show that the DNA-binding domain of GCN4 is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction. We suggest the possibility that this GCN4-Pol II interaction may be important for transcription in vivo.\r"

We demonstrate here that this is a misconception rooted in the kinetic methods used to assay for occupancy of a quinone in the QB site. We show that observance of occupancy of the QB site, revealed by kinetic assay, is sensitive to the free-energy difference for electron transfer between the quinone at the primary quinone-binding site (QA site) and the QB site (-delta G0e-). For many of the compounds previously tested for binding at the QB site, the -delta G0e- between QA and QB is too small to permit detection of the functional quinone in the QB site. With an increased -delta G0e- achieved by replacing the native ubiquinone-10 at the QA site with lower-potential quinones or by testing higher-potential QB candidates, it is shown that the QB site binds and functions with the unsubstituted 1,4-benzoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and 9,10-phenanthraquinone, as well as with their various substituted forms. Moreover, quinones with the ortho-carbonyl configuration appear to function in a similar manner to quinones with the para-carbonyl configuration.\r"

  ".W": "A retrovirus containing the entire human platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (PDGF-B) gene was constructed in order to investigate the in vivo biological activity of its encoded growth factor. When this virus was introduced into newborn mice, it reproducibly generated fibrosarcomas at the site of inoculation. Proviruses in each fibrosarcoma analyzed had lost 149 nucleotides downstream of the PDGF-B coding region. This deletion originated from an alternative or aberrant splice event that occurred within exon 7 of the PDGF-B gene and mimicked the v-sis oncogene. Thus, deletion of this region may be necessary for efficient retrovirus replication or for more potent transforming function. Evidence that the normal growth factor coding sequence was unaltered derived from RNase protection studies and immunoprecipitation analysis. Tumors were generally polyclonal but demonstrated clonal subpopulations. Moreover, tumor-derived cell lines became monoclonal within a few tissue culture passages and rapidly formed tumors in vivo. These findings argue that overexpression of the normal human PDGF-B gene product under retrovirus control can induce the fully malignant phenotype.\r"

Amplification of c-myc was larger in tumors of rats fed a choline-devoid diet followed by a choline-supplemented diet than in tumors from animals fed a choline-devoid diet exclusively. In the former animals, low levels of c-myc gene amplification were also detected in nontumorous regions of tumor-bearing livers. The choline-devoid diet provides an in vivo experimental model for the induction of gene amplification in the rat liver. In this setting, amplification of the c-myc gene may be an early and critical event in carcinogenesis.\r"

The preprotein used is a precursor of mutant maltose-binding protein. This mutant contains alterations of the carboxyl terminus. Unlike the precursor for wild-type maltose-binding protein, the mutant precursor does not acquire a protease-resistant conformation after synthesis and retains posttranslational translocation competence. The purified cytosolic factor, added posttranslationally, is necessary and sufficient to yield virtually 100% translocation of the mutant precursor into inverted vesicles. The purified factor amounts to 0.08% of the cytosolic proteins and is a 64-kDa tetramer consisting of four identical 16-kDa subunits. Amino-terminal sequence analysis revealed that it is identical to the secB gene product. The purified SecB homotetramer is part of a larger 150-kDa complex that represents the \"export\" factor activity. During purification, the export factor activity dissociates into a 64-kDa SecB homotetramer and unidentified component(s). For the posttranslational integration of another preprotein, the precursor for the lamB gene product, into inverted vesicles, the 64-kDa SecB homotetramer is also required but additional factor(s) makes integration more efficient.\r"

  ".W": "An organized cytoskeleton is required for the cAMP-induced reverse transformation reaction in CHO-K1 cells. In the course of the reaction a considerable fraction of the genome changes its nuclease sensitivity. The current paper presents the following evidence that cAMP-induced phosphorylation of vimentin is an early step in this reaction complex. (i) Vimentin is only slightly phosphorylated in transformed CHO-K1 cells but is heavily phosphorylated in normal fibroblasts. (ii) cAMP addition almost triples the vimentin phosphorylation of CHO-K1 cells but does not change that of normal cells. (iii) Vimentin phosphorylation is one of the earliest phenomena to occur after addition of cAMP to CHO-K1 cells, preceding the cell-stretching reaction and other manifestations of reverse transformation. (iv) Indirect immunofluorescence experiments demonstrate that vimentin appears as a condensed mass in transformed CHO-K1 cells but cAMP addition restores the filamentous structure characteristic of the normal fibroblast. (v) Other transformed cells unresponsive to reverse transformation by cAMP failed to demonstrate increased phosphorylation of vimentin on treatment with cAMP. These results support the proposed scheme that phosphorylation of cytoskeletal elements initiates a large-scale genetic regulatory action in which a substantial change in the spectrum of genome exposure and sequestration occurs. A function for intermediate filaments in reverse transformation is implied.\r"

DNA sequence analysis reveals that the COOH-terminal domain of the Arabidopsis HMG-CoA reductase (containing the catalytic site of the enzyme) is highly conserved with respect to the yeast, mammalian, and Drosophila enzymes, whereas the membrane-bound amino terminus of the Arabidopsis protein is truncated and lacks the complex membrane-spanning architecture of the yeast and animal reductases. Expression of the Arabidopsis gene from the yeast GAL1 promoter in a yeast mutant lacking HMG-CoA reductase activity suppresses the growth defect of the yeast mutant. Taken together, the sequence similarity to other cloned HMG-CoA reductase genes and the suppression of the yeast hmg- mutant provide strong evidence that the novel Arabidopsis gene we have cloned encodes a functional HMG-CoA reductase enzyme.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that the SUI3 gene encodes the beta subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and that mutations at a Zn(II) finger motif of SUI3 alter the start site selection process in yeast. In this report, molecular and biochemical characterizations show that the sui2 suppressor gene encodes the alpha subunit of eIF-2. The amino acid sequence of sui2 is 58% homologous to that encoded by the cDNA of the human eIF-2 alpha. Mutations in the sui2 suppressor alleles occur in the amino-terminal portion of the protein and change amino acids that are identical at the same relative position in the yeast and human proteins. Protein sequence analysis shows that a sui2 mutant yeast strain allows initiation at a UUG codon in the absence of an AUG codon at HIS4. These data further suggest that eIF-2 is an important component of the preinitiation complex that mediates ribosomal recognition of a start codon during the scanning process.\r"

  ".W": "Two classes (site 1- and site 2-selective) of cAMP analogs, which either alone or in combination demonstrate a preference for binding to type II rather than type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozyme, potently inhibit growth in a spectrum of human cancer cell lines in culture. Treatment of K-562 human leukemic cells for 3 days with 30 and 10 microM 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP) (site 1-selective) resulted in 60% and 20% growth inhibition, respectively (with over 90% viability). N6-Benzyl-cAMP (site 2-selective) (30 microM) treatment resulted in 20% growth inhibition by day 3. When 8-Cl-cAMP (10 microM) and N6-benzyl-cAMP (30 microM) were both added, growth was almost completely arrested. The growth inhibition was accompanied by megakaryocytic differentiation in K-562 cells. The untreated control cells expressed little or no detectable levels of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa surface antigen complex. 8-Cl-cAMP (30 microM) treatment for 3 days substantially increased the antigen expression, while N6-benzyl-cAMP caused little or no change in the antigen expression. When cells were treated with 8-Cl-cAMP in combination with N6-benzyl-cAMP, antigen expression was synergistically enhanced, and cells demonstrated megakaryocyte morphology. By Northern blotting, we examined the mRNA levels of the type I and type II protein kinase regulatory subunits (RI alpha and RII beta), the catalytic subunit, and c-myc during 8-Cl-cAMP treatment. The steady-state level of RII beta cAMP receptor mRNA sharply increased within 1 hr of treatment and remained elevated for 3 days, while that of the RI alpha receptor markedly decreased to below control level within 6 hr and remained low during treatment. However, 8-Cl-cAMP did not affect the mRNA level of the catalytic subunit. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment also brought about a rapid decrease in c-myc mRNA. Thus, differential regulation of cAMP receptor genes is an early event in cAMP-induced differentiation and growth control of K-562 leukemia cells.\r"

The nucleotide sequences of the three human genes were highly conserved within the regions encoding the 21-residue (mature) endothelins, in spite of the fact that the immediately upstream exon sequences, which encode a part of the propeptides, retained little similarity. Moreover, each of the human genes predicted a putative 21-residue peptide, similar to but distinct from each other: (i) the \"classical\" endothelin (ET-1), (ii) [Trp6,Leu7]endothelin (ET-2), and (iii) [Thr2,Phe4,Thr5,Tyr6, Lys7,Tyr14]endothelin (ET-3).

Blood glucose and fasting insulin levels remained within normal limits and IGF-II levels were suppressed. In contrast to insulin, fasting C peptide levels were decreased. GH secretion was also suppressed by IGF-I. Our preliminary data allow us to distinguish between the effects of GH per se and those of IGF-I: GH causes hyperinsulinism, whereas IGF-I leads to decreased insulin secretion. Glomerular filtration rate, as estimated by creatinine clearance, increased to 130% of preinfusion values during the IGF-I infusion. Total creatinine and urea excretion remained unchanged. We conclude that IGF-I influences kidney function and, in contrast to GH, exerts an insulin-sparing effect. It may be speculated that the therapeutic spectrum of IGF-I is quite different from that of GH.\r"

  ".W": "Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is a neurological disorder of unknown cause occurring in patients with an identified or occult cancer. An autoimmune etiology is likely since autoantibodies directed against the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum have been found in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of some patients. Two Purkinje cell-specific antigens are recognized by these autoantibodies, a major antigen of 62 kDa (CDR 62, cerebellar degeneration-related 62-kDa protein) and a minor antigen of 34 kDa (CDR 34). Our previous studies have described the isolation and characterization of a human cerebellar cDNA that encodes an epitope recognized by sera from patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We have now established by two independent methods that this gene is uniquely expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and corresponds to the minor antigen CDR 34. This antigen is also expressed in tumor tissue from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients with multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive type, were examined for DNA sequences homologous to a human retrovirus. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed for the presence of homologous sequences to the human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat, 3' gag, pol, and env domains by the enzymatic in vitro gene amplification technique, polymerase chain reaction. Positive identification of homologous pol sequences was made in the amplified DNA from six of these patients (29%). Three of these six patients (14%) also tested positive for the env region, but not for the other regions tested. In contrast, none of the samples from 35 normal individuals studied was positive when amplified and tested with the same primers and probes. Comparison of patterns obtained from controls and from patients with adult T-cell leukemia or tropical spastic paraparesis suggests that the DNA sequences identified are exogenous to the human genome and may correspond to a human retroviral species. The data support the detection of a human retroviral agent in some patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

Although immunologically related, these SIVagm are clearly distinct from other simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, including isolates from Macaca mulatta (SIVmac) or even from other AGM. The SIVagm strains described in this communication grow well in a limited number of human T-lymphoma lines. Virus density, morphology, and reverse transcriptase activity are characteristic of the lentivirus group. SIVagm exhibits the following pattern of major virus proteins: p18, p28, gp45, p64, gp140. They appear to bind to the target cell via the CD4 or its primate analogue. Four virus isolates have already been molecularly cloned for detailed genomic analysis and within this SIV agm group they exhibit the genomic variability that is typical of lentiviruses. AGMs infected with this virus apparently remain healthy and therefore SIVagm not only provides a virus model for vaccine studies but also allows investigation of the defense mechanisms (immunological and others) that keep the AGMs healthy. Furthermore, precise genomic analysis of these and other SIV strains will lead to a better understanding of the evolution and pathogenicity of human lentiviruses like HIV.\r"

M., Varrichio, A. & Crooke, S. T. (1988) Nature (London) 334, 268-270], which we designate PLC-A. The isozymes displayed different localizations. PLC-A mRNA was highest in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, choroid plexus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, rostral raphe nuclei, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. PLC-I was highest in the internal granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, reticular nucleus of thalamus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. PLC-II had a more widespread distribution, with relatively high levels in the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells. PLC-III label was low throughout the brain. These distributions suggest selective coupling of individual PLC isozymes with particular postsynaptic receptors. PLC-A may be preferentially associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1C receptors, vasopressin V1 receptors, and a subtype of glutamate receptors. PLC-I may be linked to muscarinic m1 and m3 receptors as well as other receptors. The distribution of PLC-II mRNA resembles that of src protooncogene, with which it displays sequence homology.\r"

Low concentrations (10 mM) of chicken II luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or substance P (SP) suppressed IM; in addition, higher concentrations (1 microM) desensitized receptors. Desensitization is homologous (specific to the peptide) and lasts at least 25 min. Two stimulators of PKC, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and dioctanoylglycerol, partially depressed IM and occluded the response to SP but not to LHRH. The two actions of PKC stimulators were blocked by PKC inhibitors (staurosporine, a pseudosubstrate peptide, and H-7), but SP- and LHRH-mediated suppression of IM and receptor desensitization were not affected. Thus, we conclude that PKC is not necessary for normal IM suppression or receptor desensitization.\r"

During the twentieth century, preventive medicine moved from advocating a public health, community-based approach toward preventing specific diseases in individual patients. The establishment of preventive medicine as a discipline has been fostered both by recent concerns that medical care emphasizes cure, rather than care, and by efforts to reduce health care costs.\r"

The longitudinal (CL), transverse (CT), and anteroposterior (CAP) diameters of the caudate lobe and the transverse diameter of the right lobe (RL) were measured, and one-, two-, and three-dimensional caudate lobe indexes and ratios were calculated. The analysis of the diagnostic performance of these criteria, compared by means of receiver-operating characteristic curves, revealed that the ratio of the three-dimensional caudate index (CI3) to the right lobe diameter (CI3/RL = [CL X CT X CAP]/RL) was superior to all other calculated criteria. At a specificity of 95%, the sensitivity of CI3/RL was 94.7%, compared with 73.3% for CT/RL. No significant differences were found between the control group and patients with fatty liver, metastases, or lymphomatous involvement. The study suggests that CI3/RL is the most reliable quantitative criterion for the US diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.\r"

Specific criteria for diagnosis of carotid invasion included visualization of an obvious break in the carotid wall with an offset in two planes and sonographic demonstration of gross tumor within the lumen. False-positive interpretations are more likely if there is inability to image the vessel at a perpendicular interface, if the abnormality cannot be seen in two planes, or if the neoplastic mass adjacent to the carotid considerably attenuates the acoustic beam.\r"

Thyroid lymphomas appeared as extremely hypoechoic masses intermingled with echogenic structures. Although echogenicity of unaffected thyroid tissue was also low because of coexisting Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroid lymphomas were relatively well differentiated as markedly hypoechoic areas. Five tumors showed contiguous spread into both thyroid lobes. US and CT were equally sensitive in detection of superficial lymphomatous nodes (seven of 16 cases). CT was superior to US in the definition of tumor extent in two patients with intrathoracic tumor extension and in one with laryngeal invasion. In patients with suspected thyroid lymphoma, CT should be the primary radiologic technique used for diagnosis and staging; US will be useful in local follow-up.\r"

Posterior tibial and peroneal veins demonstrated flow accentuation in 98% (74 of 75) and 96% (72 of 75), respectively, of the limbs without thrombosis and in all 20 normal limbs. Sixteen legs were involved with deep venous thrombosis. Peroneal veins could not be seen in three legs with marked calf swelling due to proximal thrombosis. There were two cases of thrombosis limited to the calf, nine of popliteal thrombosis (seven with contiguous spread of thrombus), and five of thrombosis limited to above the knee (four with sparing of the deep veins of the calf). Visualization of anterior tibial veins, achieved in 65% of all legs, did not correlate with thrombosis. The authors conclude that color Doppler flow imaging can demonstrate patency of posterior tibial and peroneal veins in most patients without deep venous thrombosis and aid in detection of below-the-knee thrombosis.\r"

The instantaneous two-dimensional velocity profiles and the integrated flow rate were determined in intervals down to 21 msec throughout the cardiac cycle. The results were validated by means of comparative measurements with a multigated Doppler ultrasound instrument. The velocity values acquired with this instrument in one spatial dimension in the anteroposterior direction of the abdominal aorta agreed to a great extent with the temporal and spatial corresponding values recorded with MR imaging. The same high correlation between the two methods was found for the calculated instantaneous total blood flow.\r"

The authors prospectively performed duplex Doppler ultrasound (US) evaluations in 21 kidneys (obstructed, n = 14; nonobstructed, n = 7) immediately before percutaneous nephrostomy. In addition, ten of the obstructed kidneys were evaluated with follow-up Doppler US after percutaneous nephrostomy. Renal obstruction caused a change in the Doppler waveform detected by means of the resistive index (RI). Thirteen of the 14 obstructed kidneys had a RI value greater than .70, while none of the nonobstructed kidneys had a RI value exceeding .70. Relief of the obstruction resulted in a reduced RI; in nine of ten kidneys, the RI was less than or equal to .70 (similar to that of the nonobstructed kidneys). When a dilated collecting system is being imaged, additional evaluation with duplex Doppler US may help distinguish obstructed from nonobstructed dilatation, which may be of particular benefit in patients with conditions that usually predispose them to collecting system dilatation.\r"

Vascular structures accounted for the separation of the sinus echoes in 43% of patients. In patients 12 years of age or younger, this frequency rose to 61%. The simple procedure of evaluating the renal sinus echo separation with pulsed Doppler US should decrease the frequency of false-positive diagnoses of hydronephrosis and thus diminish the need for further confirmatory testing.\r"

Seventy-four had severe underlying illnesses, and infection was hospital acquired in 80. PMB resulted from intraabdominal, urinary tract, or soft tissue infection in 45 patients, but a wide range of sources were implicated in the rest. Eleven patients had more than one source for the bacteremia, and, despite intensive diagnostic efforts, 24 had no identifiable source for at least one blood isolate. Bacteremia due to gram-negative bacilli most commonly occurred in intraabdominal, urinary tract, and wound infections; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were most frequently isolated. Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant gram-positive isolates. Certain bacterial combinations seemed to provide a clue for predicting the source of PMB: for example, S. aureus together with gram-negative facultative rods usually arose from a skin or soft tissue source, whereas S. faecalis together with a gram-negative bacillus could often be traced to an intraabdominal infection. No unique clinical features appeared to predict the occurrence of bacteremia due to multiple rather than to a single organism. The mortality in patients was 21%, lower than has previously been described in PMB but similar to that reported for bacteremia due to a single organism.\r"

Although there are no human isolates, serologic evidence in humans (using an animal pathogen [Encephalitozoon cuniculi] as the antigen) suggests that clinically silent infections may occur in humans, as they do in mice, rabbits, dogs, foxes, squirrel monkeys, and birds. Experiments in mice suggest that patients with impaired T cell functions may be vulnerable to clinical disease caused by these parasites. There is no known treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The literature on the interaction between antimicrobial drugs, microorganisms, and phagocytes is reviewed. Critical assessment of the methods used in various studies is indispensable in the interpretation of results. The available data seldom permit firm conclusions, but a number of interactions can be postulated. Chemotaxis is influenced by beta-lactam antibiotics, which induce an increased release of chemoattractants from bacteria; inhibitors of protein synthesis (erythromycin, tetracyclines) reduce the release of chemoattractants. Rifampin and tetracyclines inhibit chemotactic activity of granulocytes. Phagocytosis is diminished by tetracyclines and bacitracin. Intracellular killing is impaired by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Antimicrobial drugs that inhibit protein synthesis alter the surface of bacteria, changing the opsonic requirements for phagocytosis. Antimicrobial agents that act on the cell wall or disrupt the organization of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria increase bacterial vulnerability to the lethal action of granulocytes. Cellular enzymes of granulocytes act synergistically with a variety of drugs. Synergism between monocytes and penicillins has also been shown. The degree of penetration of an antimicrobial drug into phagocytic cells is not correlated with the intracellular activity of the drug. Polymyxin B, colistin, rifampin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and quinolones kill bacteria phagocytosed by granulocytes. Penicillins, rifampin, and chloramphenicol show microbicidal activity against bacteria ingested by monocytes or macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Rape is a violent crime that is increasing rapidly in incidence. Victims can include male and female adults and children. These victims may be at risk for the acquisition of many sexually transmitted conditions. The risk will vary with the sex and socioeconomic status of the assailant as well as with the nature of the sexual contact. Infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, and Treponema pallidum have all been found to occur following sexual assault of female adults or children. Although data are lacking, male victims of homosexual rape are presumably at risk for the acquisition of the above infections as well as hepatitis B, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and other infections prevalent among homosexual men. All victims of sexual assault should undergo a comprehensive physical examination with a complete history. Baseline and follow-up laboratory tests should be performed. In some instances, prophylactic administration of antimicrobial agents may be warranted.\r"

  ".U": "89203116\r", 
  ".W": "The epidemiology of pertussis may be approximately represented by an equation that relates the rate of increase in incidence of pertussis to the contagiousness of pertussis, the number of contacts per case, and the proportion of the population susceptible. By use of this equation it is possible to estimate the proportion of the population that is susceptible to pertussis at any stage of a pertussis epidemic. Data from pertussis epidemics in England and Wales in the last 10 years suggest that the level of immunity to pertussis has fluctuated between 92% and 94% of the total population. During this period pertussis vaccine uptake in England and Wales has risen from a low of 30% to the present level of approximately 80%. Comparison with other countries suggests that a further increase in vaccine uptake to levels above 90% would reduce pertussis incidence to less than one-tenth of its present level. These aspects of pertussis epidemiology are likely to be of relevance in the planning and interpretation of future pertussis vaccine trials, such as are expected to start in England shortly.\r"

His course was complicated by severe acute graft rejection, which required additional transplants 2 and 4 months, respectively, after the first. Review of the medical literature documented an additional 28 cases of aspergillus endocarditis in patients without prior cardiac surgery. The majority of the patients were immunosuppressed. The most common presenting feature was fever, and embolic phenomena occurred in half of the patients during illness. No blood cultures yielded Aspergillus species. Laboratory findings were nonspecific. The diagnosis was made before death in only seven cases. It was based on histologic examination of either embolectomy tissue (four patients) or skin biopsy tissue (one patient) and on echocardiographic demonstration of vegetations (two patients). Echocardiography failed to show vegetations in five of nine cases tested. Two patients survived. Aspergillus endocarditis should be considered in an immunocompromised host who presents with fever and embolic phenomena, with or without a cardiac murmur, and whose blood cultures are sterile.\r"

The IHA and IFA techniques were highly sensitive (97% and 91%, respectively), but their specificity was low (60% and 50%). When a titer of greater than or equal to 1:2,560 was used as a criterion for IHA positivity, the specificity of the test rose to 87%, with sensitivity at 75%. CIE had a high degree of specificity (96%) but a low degree of sensitivity (58%). A good correlation was found between clinical evolution of infection and serologic data. Two of 12 patients who could be followed for 9-16 months had a rise in antibody titer detected either by IFA or by IHA and CIE. These two patients had a persistent chondrocostal tumor and C. albicans endocarditis, respectively. All of the other patients, who were cured, had a decrease in titer detected by IHA and IFA and had negative CIE results at the end of follow-up. Serum mannan antigen was not found in any case. The detection of antibody to C. albicans may be useful for diagnosis and follow-up of such patients.\r"

Review of the literature reveals that all previously reported cases occurred in children with meningitis. These children were treated initially with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and had complicated courses characterized by delayed sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid. The present report describes an infant who developed meningitis due to ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant Hib. The patient received cefotaxime from the onset of therapy and had an uncomplicated course. The presence of Hib strains resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin should be considered in patients with meningitis due to Hib who respond poorly to treatment with these two drugs. Furthermore, the in vitro susceptibility of all Hib isolates to chloramphenicol (as well as to other antimicrobial agents) should be evaluated routinely. If the incidence of such resistant organisms increases, a change will be warranted in the commonly recommended combination of ampicillin and chloramphenicol as empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis in pediatric patients.\r"

All predicted base pairs that can participate in suboptimal structures may be displayed and analyzed graphically. Representative suboptimal foldings are generated by selecting these base pairs one at a time and computing the best foldings that contain them. A distance criterion that ensures that no two structures are \"too close\" is used to avoid multiple generation of similar structures. Thermodynamic parameters, including free-energy increments for single-base stacking at the ends of helices and for terminal mismatched pairs in interior and hairpin loops, are incorporated into the underlying folding model of the above algorithm.\r"

A rat complementary DNA clone encoding a T3 receptor form of the ErbA protein, called r-ErbA beta-2, was isolated. The r-ErbA beta-2 protein differs at its amino terminus from the previously described rat protein encoded by c-erbA beta and referred to as r-ErbA beta-1. Unlike the other members of the c-erbA proto-oncogene family, which have a wide tissue distribution, r-erbA beta-2 appears to be expressed only in the anterior pituitary gland. In addition, thyroid hormone downregulates r-erbA beta-2 messenger RNA but not r-erbA beta-1 messenger RNA in a pituitary tumor-derived cell line. The presence of a pituitary-specific form of the thyroid hormone receptor that may be selectively regulated by thyroid hormone could be important for the differential regulation of gene expression by T3 in the pituitary gland.\r"

Peptide mapping localized the inserted amino acid to a single peptide, and enough enzyme could be generated for purification to homogeneity. The catalytic properties of several mutants at the conserved Phe66 were characterized. The ability to selectively replace amino acids in a protein with a wide variety of structural and electronic variants should provide a more detailed understanding of protein structure and function.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that allelic deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 occur in over 75% of colorectal carcinomas. Twenty chromosome 17p markers were used to localize the common region of deletion in these tumors to a region contained within bands 17p12 to 17p13.3. This region contains the gene for the transformation-associated protein p53. Southern and Northern blot hybridization experiments provided no evidence for gross alterations of the p53 gene or surrounding sequences. As a more rigorous test of the possibility that p53 was a target of the deletions, the p53 coding regions from two tumors were analyzed; these two tumors, like most colorectal carcinomas, had allelic deletions of chromosome 17p and expressed considerable amounts of p53 messenger RNA from the remaining allele. The remaining p53 allele was mutated in both tumors, with an alanine substituted for valine at codon 143 of one tumor and a histidine substituted for arginine at codon 175 of the second tumor. Both mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene that was previously found to be mutated in murine p53 oncogenes. The data suggest that p53 gene mutations may be involved in colorectal neoplasia, perhaps through inactivation of a tumor suppressor function of the wild-type p53 gene.\r"

The true granulomatous vasculitides, a group that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, allergic granulomatosis and angiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), and necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis, have various degrees of systemic involvement. Therapy is mainly immunosuppressive, and prognosis is generally good. The lymphoproliferative granulomatous vasculitides, which include benign lymphocytic angiitis and granulomatosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and malignant lymphoma with angioinvasion, are progressively abnormal lymphoproliferative processes. Therapy may require combination chemotherapy, and prognosis is often poor.\r"

To find out whether excising injured muscle surrounding a bullet path benefits healing over and above the benefit provided by a simple release of tension by incision, two groups of 90 kg swine were shot in the hind leg with a replica of the AK-74 assault rifle projectile. One group was treated by excision of injured tissue around the projectile path; in the other group no tissue was excised. Both groups were given parenteral penicillin for 5 days, and simple gauze dressings were used to cover the wounds. No difference in healing time occurred; the wounds in both groups had closed, and no epithelial defect remained by 20 to 22 days. These results indicate that the simple extremity wound caused by the modern-generation assault rifle, provided with adequate open drainage and systemic penicillin, heals as rapidly when the body defense mechanisms handle the disrupted tissue as when an attempt is made to excise it surgically.\r"

  ".U": "89203701\r", 
  ".W": "A specific chemotactic factor for lymphocytes was found in thymic tissue extract from myasthenic patients who had undergone thymectomy. Biologic activities and the biochemical nature of this factor were examined. The major findings were as follows: (1) The factor from myasthenic thymus was specifically chemotactic for T lymphocytes. Marker analysis of target cells revealed that only OKT4 positive cells (helper/inducer T cells) responded to the factor. Chemotactic activity was also found in the normal thymus, but its activity was different from that found in the myasthenic thymus. Interestingly, OKT8 positive cells (suppressor/cytotoxic T cells), as well as OKT4 positive cells, migrated toward the normal thymic extract (2) Chromatography of the extract by gel filtration gave three peaks with chemotactic activity; molecular size were 160,000 to 100,000, 25,000 to 15,000, and smaller than 1350 daltons (3) The factor was inactivated by heating for 30 minutes at 56 degree C and was also destroyed under conditions of pH 4 and pH 10. The factor was also sensitive to treatment by trypsin, sodium metaperiodata, 8 mol/L urea, reduction, or alkylation. (4) The chemotactic activity in the myasthenic thymus was distinct from other known chemotactic factors, including C5a, interleukin-1, and interleukin-2. (5) Chemotactic activity for lymphocytes was found in both the aqueous extract and the culture supernatant of thymic stromal cells, but not in thymocyte extract or in the serum. These findings indicate that the chemotactic factor specific for OKT4 positive cells may be secreted by stromal cells of the myasthenic thymus but not of the normal thymus.\r"

We have measured albumin leakage from standardized scald burns in the rat jejunum with and without variously sized fractions of intravenous macromolecules of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) used as a sealing agent. The observed reduction of albumin leakage from injured capillaries was attributed to the sealing effect. The fraction HES (Fm) with molecular weights of 100,000 to 300,000 daltons performed significantly better (p less than 0.05) as a sealing agent when compared with HES (F1) fraction molecular weights of 300,000 to 3.4 million daltons, HES (Fs) molecular weight less than 50,000 daltons, and two control groups receiving the intravenous Ringer's lactate solution or serum albumin 5%. This capillary sealing phenomenon was shown to be independent of colloid osmotic pressure effect. It is believed to be related to the size and the shape of the noncharged macromolecules.\r"

  ".U": "89203705\r", 
  ".W": "Radical pancreatoduodenectomy for treatment of pancreatic carcinoma has been the surgical standard of care for the past four decades. The recent popularization of pylorus-sparing pancreatoduodenectomy to treat benign pancreatic disease, because of its decreased morbidity and long-term nutritional consequences, has led to the use of this procedure in cases of pancreatic carcinoma. We report recent experience with three patients with pancreatic carcinoma in whom pyloric preservation would have compromised the potential chance for curative resection or compromised palliation because of occult spread of tumor to a region not resected with this new operative approach. Two patients had proximal, microscopic intramural spread of pancreatic adenocarcinoma within the duodenum or antrum--a mode of spread not previously reported with pancreatic carcinoma. Both patients had no other evidence of metastatic involvement, and both would have had positive surgical margins in a pylorus-sparing pancreatoduodenectomy. A third case demonstrates a true submucosal recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after a pylorus-sparing pancreatoduodenectomy. It is debatable that any case demonstrating intramural spread within the duodenum could be cured with a standard Whipple resection as this may well represent another sign of incurability, like lymphatic or perineural spread, but it is clearly a major potential obstacle to palliation if submucosal recurrences occur as a result of the use of the pylorus-sparing pancreatoduodenectomy in cases of pancreatic cancer. The use of pylorus-sparing pancreatoduodenectomy in resectable pancreatic cancers must be viewed skeptically at this time.\r"

Patients with cystic fibrosis now commonly survive into adulthood and are at high risk for the development of cholelithiasis. The diagnosis may be obscured by other common gastrointestinal complications of cystic fibrosis. Optimal surgical management includes meticulous preoperative and postoperative pulmonary care. The surgeon must also have a thorough knowledge of the biliary tract anomalies that have been described in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Only 17 surgical cases of adrenal hemangiomas have been reported, with an additional case not surgically treated. The pertinent literature has been reviewed. Two additional cases, one identified preoperatively and both removed surgically, are presented herein. Ultrasonograms and computed tomographs showed large, necrotic masses without calcifications. Preoperative angiograms taken for case 1 demonstrated pooling of contrast media within this mass, strongly suggesting a diagnosis of hemangioma; case 2 lacked similar angiographic findings. The radiologic finding of calcifications, when present, along with the characteristic angiographic appearance of a hemangioma, allows the radiologist to correctly diagnose this benign tumor preoperatively. Although rare, these tumors should be part of the differential diagnosis of adrenal neoplasms.\r"

Pancreatic calculi cause hemorrhage by either migrating through the pancreatic parenchyma to perforate the duodenum, ulcerating the vessels of the periductal parenchyma, or rupturing the pancreas. The usual sign of this complication of chronic calcifying pancreatitis, difficult to diagnose, is repeated gastrointestinal hemorrhages and sometimes pain, as in epigastric colitis. The immediate therapy is control of the hemorrhage. With transcatheter occlusive techniques, radical surgery can be postponed until it is more tolerable.\r"

Patients breathed compressed air or supplemental oxygen via nasal cannulas on consecutive nights in a randomised, double blind, crossover trial. Quality of sleep was assessed by questionnaire and by electroencephalographic sleep staging. The study had a power of 80% to detect, at the 0.05 level, a 20% improvement in total sleep time. Seventeen patients slept for two nights in the laboratory. Oxygenation during sleep was improved by oxygen administration, but there was no improvement in quality of sleep. There was an acclimatisation effect with better sleep on the second night. Six patients spent an additional acclimatisation night in the laboratory as well as the two study nights. There was no difference in sleep quality between the second and third nights or between the compressed air and the oxygen nights in these patients. Subgroups of patients with an arterial carbon dioxide tension of over 43 mm Hg (5.7 kPa) (n = 12) and arterial oxygen saturation of less than 90% (n = 11) while awake did not show any improvement in quality of sleep on the oxygen night. It is concluded that supplemental oxygen improves nocturnal oxygenation but does not immediately improve the quality of sleep in the laboratory in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Engraftment of class I + II disparate allogeneic BM after conditioning with this regimen required depletion of both L3T4 and Lyt2 host T cell subsets in vivo. Treatment with a combination of specific mAbs to each subset (GK1.5 plus 2.43) was more effective than treatment with an anti-Thy1 mAb (30-H12). The low incidence of engraftment after 30-H12 treatment is probably due to reduced efficiency of 30-H12 in depletion of host alloreactive cell populations rather than an effect of this mAb on a particular population of donor cells that are important for engraftment.\r"
