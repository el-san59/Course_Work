  ".W": "We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients.\r"

However, early pregnancy complications have been less well studied. This report compares spontaneous and induced abortions in a nationally representative sample of 5096 female medical school graduates (who experienced 1284 pregnancies) and of the sexual partners of 5000 of their male classmates (who experienced 1481 pregnancies). The response to the survey was 86.1%. The life-table probability of spontaneous abortion was 14.8% for female residents compared with 12.6% for the sexual partners of male residents. However, female residents were more likely than the male residents' sexual partners to terminate a pregnancy voluntarily (8.2% vs 2.7%). The increased risk of voluntary termination persisted when only married women were studied (3.6% vs 1.4%). However, female residents' pregnancies were at approximately half the risk of voluntary termination compared with pregnancies among the general US population of women aged 25 to 34 years. These results provide reassurance to those residents who would like to become pregnant but are concerned about the possible effect of their occupation on the course of the pregnancy.\r"

The availability of HIV status and occupational information permits the assessment of prevalence and incidence of infection in this population. Levels of infection were not higher among women or among currently married men with medical occupations compared with those with nonmedical occupations. Prevalence and incidence were elevated among never-married men with either military or civilian medical occupations compared with never-married men with nonmedical occupations. Based on reported civilian occupation, male registered nurses and men with other medical occupations, excluding physicians and dentists, had a significantly higher prevalence of infection than men with nonmedical occupations. The patterns of infection suggest that the higher levels of infection found among never-married men with medical occupations may not be entirely due to occupational exposure. These findings may have applications in the design and interpretation of results of health care worker HIV surveillance programs.\r"

Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine.\r"

This professionally derived system would help prevent injury and improve the resolution of injuries. Prior work on accelerated-compensation events was largely conceptual, so to study the likely effects of accelerated-compensation events, we applied the events to a large database of obstetrical malpractice claims. Results refute prior criticisms. Accelerated-compensation events (1) are definitely feasible to develop and apply, (2) would probably cover two thirds of currently paid claims and three quarters of indemnity dollars, (3) would likely involve substantial savings in time and expense per case, and (4) would probably not introduce an unmanageable number of large new claims.\r"

Symptoms often occurred immediately after exposure to latex, and manifestations varied according to the route of latex antigen presentation. Skin exposure usually caused contact urticaria. Exposure to latex in the air elicited allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. Systemic effects from latex occurred intraoperatively due to the surgeon's latex gloves. Anaphylactic shock included the above symptoms with the addition of tachycardia and hypotension. All patients had positive latex skin tests. Serum IgE antibody to latex was found with a latex radioallergosorbent test in all but one tested patient. Physicians should be aware that latex allergy can present as anaphylaxis during surgery, barium enema, or dental work. Latex skin tests are a satisfactory method of diagnosis. Nonlatex gloves are available and are tolerated by affected people.\r"

To comply with the standard, toy manufacturers place age labels on packaging to indicate the ages for which toys with small parts are recommended. We conducted a survey of 199 toy buyers to determine the degree to which they understood such labels as warnings and whether more explicit warning labels would affect toy buyers' willingness to purchase toys with small parts for children between 2 and 3 years of age. Forty-four percent of respondents said they would buy for a child between 2 and 3 years of age a toy with the label \"Recommended for 3 and up\"; only 5% said they would buy for a young child a toy with the label \"Not recommended for below 3--small parts.\" These findings indicate that a change in the small parts standard to require more specific labeling might substantially reduce potentially hazardous toy purchases.\r"

The clinical use of pelvic ultrasonography depends on a thorough understanding of normal anatomy and cyclical changes and on the relative limitations of the imaging modality in specifically characterizing pathologic processes. This article reviews the accepted role of pelvic sonography in gynecologic disease and provides a preview of some of the potential applications of recent advances in sonographic technology.\r"

The average observed death rate for all acute myocardial infarction patients in the study who were in a given admission severity group was used to estimate the expected death probability for each case in a given group. (This is the same method used by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for risk adjusting hospital mortality by diagnosis related groups in that state.) When compared with observed deaths, estimates of expected mortality were significantly biased for many patient attributes (eg, age, location of acute myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart failure, serum potassium level, serum urea nitrogen level, pulse rate, and blood pressure). These results are consistent with a conclusion that the MedisGroups scoring algorithm omits some important risk variables, inappropriately includes some other variables reflecting postadmission status, and gives the wrong weights to some appropriate risk variables. To the extent that these findings are also applicable to current MedisGroups scoring algorithms and to other conditions and procedures, MedisGroups admission severity groups cannot fairly adjust for interhospital case mix differences in outcome studies.\r"

Most women with AIDS were black or Hispanic (72%); residents of large metropolitan areas (73%), especially cities along the Atlantic coast; and of reproductive age (15 to 44 years) (85%). However, the proportion of women with AIDS reported by smaller cities and rural areas has increased from 22% in 1986 to 28% in 1990. The male-to-female ratio of heterosexuals with AIDS has remained about 2.4:1 since 1987. A comparison of women with AIDS to heterosexual men with AIDS showed that these two groups were similar by age, race, and geographic distribution. Also, survival times from AIDS diagnosis to death for women and heterosexual men with AIDS were not significantly different.\r"

To investigate attitudes surrounding treatment for such newborns, we conducted a survey of professionals at six neonatal intensive care units in New York City. A significant proportion of the 247 respondents recommended less aggressive treatment for non-HIV-related conditions for infants at risk for HIV compared with those not at risk. For example, 97% of respondents recommended open heart surgery for an infant with no known HIV risk but only 77% recommended surgery for an infant whose mother had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; if certain the infant was infected, 42% of respondents recommended surgery.

  ".W": "A survey of a sample of physician group practices in Wisconsin was undertaken to determine the amounts of charity care, bad debt, and discounted Medicaid care that were provided in 1988. Overall, the physician group practices in the sample reported dollar amounts of uncompensated care and discounted Medicaid care that averaged approximately 7.6% of their total billings for the year (1.6% of charity care, 3.0% of bad debt, and 3.0% of discounted Medicaid care). From the dollar totals reported, it was calculated that the individual physicians represented by this sample of group practices were responsible for, on average, +4300 of charity care, +9100 of bad debt, and +7500 of Medicaid discounted services, for a yearly per-physician total of +20,900 of uncompensated care and discounted care provided to uninsured and indigent patients. The results indicate that a majority of the group practices provided more charity care in 1988 than they had 5 years earlier and suggest that the burden of providing uncompensated care tends to fall disproportionately on those group practices that are also providing relatively high levels of service to Medicaid recipients.\r"

A decision analysis was performed to determine if and when isoniazid should be prescribed to prevent tuberculosis in these patients. The decision was analyzed for an intravenous drug abuser who may have been anergic, while tuberculin test status, race, and gender were varied. The assumptions and parameter estimates selected for this investigation represent a highly conservative vantage point opposing the use of isoniazid as a preventive therapy. Nevertheless, results showed a benefit from the use of isoniazid as a preventive therapy for all groups, even without tuberculin testing, except tuberculin-negative black women. This benefit of isoniazid therapy increased patient life expectancy as much as 285 days. Further, the decisions continue to favor prescribing isoniazid even when the suspected incidence of tuberculosis infection falls as low as 3% to 8%. Tuberculin testing appears important primarily for black women, since those who have negative tuberculin skin tests may not be candidates for isoniazid therapy.\r"

A fiberoptic fluorescence guided laser recanalization system was developed and evaluated in vitro for recanalization of 17 human femoral or tibial totally occluded arterial segments (length 1.9-6.8 cm, diameter 2.5-6.0 mm). A 400 or 600 micron silica fiber was coupled to a helium-cadmium laser (lambda = 325 nm) for fluorescence excitation and to a holmium: YAG laser (lambda = 2.1 micron) for tissue ablation. Fluorescence was recorded during recanalization after every other holmium laser pulse. During recanalization, each arterial segment was bent 30-90 degrees with respect to the fiber to simulate arterial tortuosity. Ablation continued with fiber advancement as long as the fluorescence confirmed that the target tissue was atherosclerotic. Arterial spectra were classified as normal or atherosclerotic by an on-line computerized fluorescence classification algorithm (sensitivity 93%, specificity 95%). Normal fluorescence necessitated redirection of the fiber greater than 30 times per segment to continue recanalization. Fifteen of 17 totally occluded arteries had multiple recanalization channels created following total energy delivery of 40-1,016 Joules per segment with no angiographic or histologic evidence of laser perforation. Two heavily calcified arterial occlusions were not recanalized due to inhibition of holmium: YAG laser ablation by the recording of normal fluorescence spectra. Therefore, this fluorescence guided laser recanalization system appears safe and effective for recanalization of totally occluded arteries and merits in vivo evaluation. However, the lower sensitivity of fluorescence detection of heavily calcified plaques may limit the efficacy (but not safety) of fluorescence guided recanalization of heavily calcified occlusions.\r"

Measured optical properties were the absorption coefficient, mu a; scattering coefficient, mu s; and scattering anisotropy factor, g. Optical measurements were performed at 1064 nm wavelength on thin plane parallel tissue slices using the integrating sphere method with glass hemispheres on either side of the sample. The study showed 1) an increase of the scattering coefficient by 40% and a two- to threefold increase in reduced scattering coefficient as a result of photocoagulation; 2) that the mu a (0.035 +/- 0.024 mm-1) and mu s (17.9 +/- 3.8 mm-1) of human myocardium were not significantly different from mu a (0.043 +/- 0.021 mm-1) and mu s (17.3 +/- 2.2 mm-1) of canine myocardium, whereas the human g (0.964 +/- 0.005) was slightly different from the canine g (0.974 +/- 0.008); and 3) that the mu a (0.021 +/- 0.016 mm-1) of epicardial fat and mu s (13.8 +/- 1.1 mm-1) of myocardial scar were significantly lower than those of normal myocardium. A dynamic model of laser-tissue interaction incorporating these changes and inhomogeneities is necessary to better describe light distribution during laser photocoagulation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the nature of particulate debris and photoproducts generated in vivo. Accordingly, cardiopulmonary bypass was established in four dogs without active cooling and an apical left ventricular vent was placed. In two dogs, a laser catheter was inserted into the cardioplegia-arrested left ventricle through the left atrial appendage and across the mitral valve. In the other two dogs the laser catheter was inserted into a perfused, fibrillating left ventricle retrograde across the aortic valve. Myocardial ablation of the ventricular septum was performed using continuous argon-ion laser irradiation (8-10 watts, 4-11 minutes) and blood samples were drawn through the ventricular vent. The final ablation in each dog was done during a separate ventricular flush with a chemical \"spin trap\" capable of detecting free radicals. Analysis of ventricular effluent revealed levels of carboxyhemoglobin and hydrogen cyanide which were well below accepted clinical toxic limits. Microparticulate debris (2-300 femtoliter) was not detected. Evidence of trace free radical generation was suggested in one of four dogs. In conclusion, closed ventricular argon laser myoplasty did not generate clinically significant levels of the toxic photoproducts we measured, or microparticulate debris. These in vivo findings suggest that the clinical application of catheter-based laser myoplasty will not be limited by the generation of these toxic photoproducts or microembolic debris.\r"

A flashlamp-pumped dye laser (495 nm, 2 microseconds) was used as the exciting source for laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) signals. Spectral data in the 520 nm to 800 nm region of normal intima, calcified plaque and fibro-fatty plaques were analyzed with an optical multichannel analyzer, using the same fiber for energy delivery and fluorescence diagnostic. Good signal to noise ratio and different spectra for different specimens were obtained within only 2 microseconds. The spectral difference is caused by selective reabsorption of oxyhemoglobin in the vessel wall. Time resolved LIF-spectroscopy shows that the fluorescence intensity reaches its maximum value before the maximum laser intensity is delivered. Fluorescence analysis can be performed in less than 300 ns and therefore the laser can be controlled before plasma threshold is reached. The described in vitro results can lead to a clinical useful feedbacksystem for energy control of microseconds lasers in angioplasty if the blood interference effects can be minimized by changing the laser excitation wavelength or staining the tissue.\r"

The Co:MgF2 laser was tuned between 1.81 and 2.14 microns, a wavelength region in which the absorption length varies by a decade. For soft tissues the ablation threshold tracks the optical absorption length; for bone there is little wavelength dependence, consistent with the low water content of bone. Thermal damage vs. wavelength was also studied for cornea and bone. Thermal damage to cornea has a weak wavelength dependence, while that to bone shows little wavelength dependence. Framing-camera pictures of the ablation of both cornea and liver show explosive removal of material, but differ as to the nature of the explosion.\r"

Red blood cells were not directly coagulated with the use of 630 nm laser, and the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) and choroidal melanocytes were coagulated. These results suggest that the use of yellow or orange dye lasers for photocoagulative therapy in a retinal hemorrhage is dangerous, because of the risk for destruction of the inner layers of the retina. A 630 nm dye laser is useful for photocoagulation of a retinal hemorrhage, while the laser energy is unable to reach the RPE cells and the choroid with the use of other wavelengths.\r"

Photocytotoxicity proportional to Ph-a concentration, intensity of irradiation, and incubation time was observed in vitro. Despite the delay in the disappearance of Ph-a from the tumor, Ph-a in the pituitary gland rapidly decreased after intravenous administration in vivo. Through PDT, the tumor grossly disappeared, the plasma levels of rat growth hormone secreted from the tumor also remarkably decreased, and the development of giantism was inhibited.

Results are compared with previous data of laser-induced fluorescence in other models and detection schemes.\r"

  ".U": "91238907\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite multiple antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in a progressively debilitating disease. We hypothesized that a more effective immune response could be generated by post-infection vaccination with HIV-specific antigens. METHODS. We performed a phase I trial of the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine prepared from molecularly cloned envelope protein, gp160, in 30 volunteer subjects with HIV infection in Walter Reed stage 1 or 2. The vaccine was administered either on days 0, 30, and 120 or on days 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, and 180. HIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were measured; local and systemic reactions to vaccination, including general measures of immune function, were monitored. RESULTS. In 19 of the 30 subjects both humoral and cellular immunity to HIV envelope proteins increased in response to vaccination with gp160. Seroconversion to selected envelope epitopes was observed, as were new T-cell proliferative responses to gp160. Response was associated with the CD4 cell count determined before vaccination (13 of 16 subjects [81 percent] with greater than 600 cells per milliliter responded, as compared with 6 of 14 [43 percent] with less than or equal to 600 cells per milliliter; P = 0.07) and with the number of injections administered (87 percent of subjects randomly assigned to receive six injections responded, as compared with 40 percent of those assigned to three injections; P = 0.02). Local reactions at the site of injection were mild. There were no adverse systemic reactions, including diminution of general in vitro or in vivo cellular immune function. After 10 months of follow-up, the mean CD4 count had not decreased in the 19 subjects who responded, but it had decreased by 7.3 percent in the 11 who did not respond. CONCLUSIONS. This gp160 vaccine is safe and immunogenic in volunteer patients with early HIV infection. Although it is too early to know whether this approach will be clinically useful, further scientific and therapeutic evaluation of HIV-specific vaccine therapy is warranted. Similar vaccines may prove to be effective for other chronic infections.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Elderly persons frequently appear to be sensitive to the effects of many drugs that depress the central nervous system. We studied the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the benzodiazepine hypnotic agent triazolam, now the most frequently prescribed hypnotic drug in the United States. METHODS. Twenty-six healthy young subjects (mean age, 30 years) and 21 healthy elderly subjects (mean age, 69 years) participated in a four-way crossover study. After a single-blind adaptation trial with placebo, each subject received, in random order and in double-blind fashion, single doses of placebo, 0.125 mg of triazolam, and 0.25 mg of triazolam. For 24 hours after the administration of each of the three study medications, plasma triazolam levels were determined and psychomotor performance, memory, and degree of sedation were assessed. RESULTS. Plasma triazolam concentrations increased in proportion to the dose, but the elderly subjects had higher plasma concentrations due to reduced clearance of the drug. The degree of sedation as rated by an observer and the reduction in the subjects' performance on the digit-symbol substitution test were both greater in the elderly than in the young subjects after they were given the same doses. The relation of the plasma triazolam concentration to the degree of impairment was similar for the two groups. As part of the study, information was presented 1 1/2 hours after the administration of the drugs; the subjects' ability to recall the information 24 hours later was impaired by both doses of triazolam, and the percent decrease was similar in the young and elderly groups. CONCLUSIONS. Triazolam caused a greater degree of sedation and greater impairment of psychomotor performance in healthy elderly persons than in young persons who received the same dose. These effects resulted from reduced clearance and higher plasma concentrations of triazolam rather than from an increased intrinsic sensitivity to the drug. On the basis of these results, the dosage of triazolam for elderly persons should be reduced on average by 50 percent.\r"

  ".U": "91238910\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum is known to be a marker of a high degree of viral infectivity. However, fulminant hepatitis may occur in persons who are negative for HBeAg. A single point mutation has been reported to produce a stop codon in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA and prevent the formation of the precore protein required to make HBeAg. To determine whether a precore-mutant virus is causally related to severe liver injury, we analyzed the entire precore region in viral strains isolated from patients with fatal cases and uncomplicated cases of hepatitis B. METHODS. Serum was obtained from 9 patients with fatal hepatitis B (5 with fulminant and 4 with severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis) and 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. Serum samples from a sex partner implicated as the source of the virus in one case of fulminant hepatitis were also studied. The 87 nucleotides in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. RESULTS. Of the nine patients with fatal hepatitis, seven had retrievable hepatitis B DNA. In all seven there was a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region, converting tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this mutation was not found in the 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The hepatitis B DNA from the implicated source contained a sequence with the stop-codon mutation that was identical to the sequence in her partner, who had fulminant hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a mutant viral strain is associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B and severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. A nosocomial outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B occurred in five patients in Haifa, Israel. Previous investigations identified the suspected source as a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen who was positive for antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen and had chronic liver disease. We examined the strain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) that caused this epidemic, in order to identify specific mutations in the precore or core region. METHODS. The presence of HBV was identified by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification of viral DNA in serum from the source patient, the five patients with fulminant hepatitis B, and five controls with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The amplified viral HBV DNA samples were then cloned and sequenced. RESULTS. Sequence analysis of viral DNA established that the same HBV mutant with two mutations in the precore region was present in the source patient and the five patients with fulminant hepatic failure. This HBV mutant had significant sequence divergence from other known HBV subtypes in the X, precore, and core regions. Cloned HBV DNA derived from a hospitalized patient who had subclinical hepatitis B at the same time as the outbreak and from four other control subjects with acute, self-limited hepatitis B all contained the wild-type sequence in the precore region. CONCLUSIONS. In the outbreak we studied, a mutant hepatitis B viral strain was transmitted from a common source to five patients who subsequently died of fulminant hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations in the HBV genome may predispose the infected host to more severe liver injury.\r"

The relative lengths of these phases differ greatly in various taxa, including as extremes those with one or the other phase reduced to a single cell. Here we consider the efficiency of elimination of deleterious mutations as an evolutionary force and compare the mutation loads under haploid and diploid selection, Ln and L2n. With truncation-like selection, partial dominance, and heterozygous effect of a mutation less than about 1/4 its hemizygous effect, L2n less than Ln; otherwise L2n greater than Ln. The difference becomes important when the genomic deleterious mutation rate exceeds about 1 per genome. This suggests that the mutation rate, degree of dominance and mode of selection can be important in life-cycle evolution.\r"

Although the relative duration of haploid and diploid phases varies greatly among taxa, the diploid phase is more conspicuous in all higher organisms. Therefore it is widely believed that diploidy offers more evolutionary possibilities and is thus nearly always selected for. We have now performed computer simulations to investigate one possible advantage of diploidy, that is, protection against the expression of deleterious mutations. Instead of comparing isolated haploid and diploid populations, we considered interbreeding haploids and diploids. Diploids invaded the population only when the dominance degree of a single deleterious mutation was smaller than about 1/2, and the condition allowing diploidy to invade depended on how harmful the mutation was.\r"

We have tested this possibility of placing the entire HBx gene under its own regulatory elements directly into the germline of mice. Transgenic animals harbouring this viral gene succumbed to progressive histopathological changes specifically in the liver, beginning with multifocal areas of altered hepatocytes, followed by the appearance of benign adenomas, and proceeding to the development of malignant carcinomas. Male mice developed disease and died much earlier than females. This transgenic animal model appears ideal for defining the molecular events that follow the expression of the viral HBx gene and are responsible for the development of liver cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase C (PKC) transduces receptor-mediated signals by phosphorylating membrane-bound substrates which then act as effectors of specific cellular responses. The myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a specific PKC substrate which has been implicated in macrophage activation, neuro-secretion and growth factor-dependent mitogenesis. Myristoylation of MARCKS is required for effective binding to the plasma membrane where it colocalizes with PKC. Here we report that PKC-dependent phosphorylation displaces MARCKS from the membrane and that its subsequent dephosphorylation is accompanied by its reassociation with the membrane. This cycle of phosphorylation-dependent membrane attachment and detachment of a myristoylated protein represents a novel mechanism of reversible membrane targeting. As MARCKS is a calmodulin- and actin-binding protein (ref. 8, and J. Hartwig et al., manuscript submitted), the cycle of membrane attachment/detachment represents a mechanism through which PKC might reversibly regulate actin-membrane interaction.\r"

There is genetic evidence that the peptides that are products of cytosolic protein degradation are transported into this compartment by a peptide supply factor (PSF), encoded in the MHC class II region. Like the corresponding genes RING4, HAM1 and mtp1, PSF is related to the multidrug-resistance family of transporters and may be a peptide pump, as translocation of peptides across membranes must occur independently of the secretory pathway. There is, however, no functional evidence for this role so far. Here we report gene transfer experiments showing that expression of PSF complementary DNA in the human lymphoblastoid cell line mutant 721.134 restores normal levels of surface HLA-A2 and -B5. No similar effect was observed in 721.174 mutant cells, in which a homozygous deletion includes PSF among several other closely linked genes. At least one of these genes may therefore also be required for PSF function.\r"

Although X-chromosome inactivation represents the most extensive example known of long range cis gene regulation, the mechanism by which thousands of genes on only one of a pair of identical chromosomes are turned off is poorly understood. We have recently identified a human gene (XIST) exclusively expressed from the inactive X chromosome. Here we report the isolation and characterization of its murine homologue (Xist) which localizes to the mouse X inactivation centre region and is the first murine gene found to be expressed from the inactive X chromosome. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that Xist may be associated with a protein product. The similar map positions and expression patterns for Xist in mouse and man suggest that this gene may have a role in X inactivation.\r"

  ".W": "X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is a regulatory phenomenon whereby one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is genetically inactivated, resulting in dosage compensation for X-linked genes between males and females. In both man and mouse, X-chromosome inactivation is thought to proceed from a single cis-acting switch region or inactivation centre (XIC/Xic). In the human, XIC has been mapped to band Xq13 (ref. 6) and in the mouse to band XD (ref. 7), and comparative mapping has shown that the XIC regions in the two species are syntenic. The recently described human XIST gene maps to the XIC region and seems to be expressed only from the inactive X chromosome. We report here that the mouse Xist gene maps to the Xic region of the mouse X chromosome and, using an interspecific Mus spretus/Mus musculus domesticus F1 hybrid mouse carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation, show that Xist is exclusively expressed from the inactive X chromosome. Conservation between man and mouse of chromosomal position and unique expression exclusively from the inactive X chromosome lends support to the hypothesis that XIST and its mouse homologue are involved in X-chromosome inactivation.\r"

Here we show that RNAs containing short runs of Gs can also tetramerize. A 19-base oligonucleotide derived from the 5S RNA of Escherichia coli (strand III), 5'GCCGAUGGUAGUGUGGGGU3', forms a K(+)-stabilized tetrameric aggregate that depends on the G residues at its 3' end. This complex is so stable that it would be surprising if similar structures do not occur in nature.\r"

  ".W": "The origin of tetrapods has been debated for many years. In traditional systematics, the extinct lobe-finned bony fish (Rhipidistia) are regarded as the closest relatives of tetrapods. Among living fish, the coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae (Actinistia), which is the only recent representative of the Crossopterygii (Actinistia and Rhipidistia), the lungfish (Dipnoi) and ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), have each been considered as sister-groups of the tetrapods. We have now determined the sequence of the alpha- and beta-globin chains of coelacanth haemoglobin and compared them with all known haemoglobins of bony and cartilaginous fish as well as those of tadpoles and adult amphibians. Haemoglobins of bony fish match more closely those of larval than adult amphibians. The beta chains of Latimeria match those of tadpoles more closely (54%) than do those of any other fish, whereas the alpha chains of Latimeria (45.4%), and especially of teleosts (49.2%), are closer to those of larval amphibians than are those of lungfish (39.8%). If only synapomorphous sequence matches (those at derived positions shared by one bony fish and tadpoles but not by any other bony fish) are considered, both Latimeria globin chains have distinctly more identities with phase of tadpoles than do those of any bony fish. Thus the primary structure of Latimeria haemoglobin indicates that the coelacanth is the closest living relative of tetrapods.\r"

Although the distribution of the cone subtypes in the adult rhesus monkey has been quantified using opsin-specific antisera, the mechanism for the phenotypic specification of the cone subtypes and the establishment of their ratios in the retinal mosaic remain unknown. Here we present immunocytochemical evidence that a subset of cones (about 10%) express their cell-specific opsin two to three weeks before the surrounding cones. Remarkably, these precocious cones are evenly stationed throughout undifferentiated regions of the retinal surface from several weeks after their last mitotic division, and at least one month before the formation of their synapses with bipolar and horizontal cells. Use of confocal laser microscopy reveals that the inner segments of immunolabelled and surrounding unlabelled cones are transiently in apposition with one another, enabling surface mediated interactions to occur during this period. We suggest that the early maturing cones induce neighbouring undifferentiated cones to express an appropriate opsin phenotype, and therefore constitute a 'protomap' for the emergence of the species-specific retinal mosaic.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that peptide ligands take part in the assembly of class I molecules. In particular, addition of peptides to extracts of the mutant cells RMA-S and .174/T2, in which stable assembly of class I does not occur, results in a conformational change in the class I heavy chain and stable association of the heavy chain with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m). Thus specific peptides may stabilize or induce a conformational change in the class I heavy chain that results in a rise in the binding affinity of the heavy chain for beta 2m (Fig. 1a). Here we show that peptides have two cooperative roles in class I assembly. Specific short peptides (9-10 amino acids) can induce folding of the heavy chain in the absence of beta 2m. Both short (nine amino acids) and longer sequences (15 amino acids) can stabilize performed low-affinity complexes of heavy chain and beta 2m. To alter the conformation of free heavy chains, the peptides must be exactly the correct size, and they are found to correspond to the sequences isolated from infected cells. This property may therefore be the basis for selection of epitopes presented in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Only about 1% of human XO conceptuses survive to birth and these usually have the characteristics of Turner's syndrome, with a complex and variable phenotype including short stature, gonadal dysgenesis and anatomical defects. Both the embryonic lethality and Turner's syndrome are thought to be due to monosomy for a gene or genes common to the X and Y chromosomes. These genes would be expected to be expressed in females from both active and inactive X chromosomes to ensure correct dosage of gene product. Two genes with these properties are ZFX and RPS4X, both of which have been proposed to play a role in Turner's syndrome. In contrast to humans, mice that are XO are viable with no prenatal lethality (P. Burgoyne, personal communication) and are anatomically normal and fertile. We have devised a system to analyse whether specific genes on the mouse X chromosome are inactivated, and demonstrate that both Zfx and Rps4X undergo normal X-inactivation in mice. Thus the relative viability of XO mice compared to XO humans may be explained by differences between the two species in the way that dosage compensation of specific genes is achieved.\r"

Thus, activin does not seem to endow ectodermal cells with polarity but rather reveals a pre-existent pattern.

  ".W": "The relationship between the structure and function of haemoglobin has mainly been studied by comparing its X-ray crystal structures with its function in solutions. To make a direct comparison we have studied the functional properties of haemoglobin in single crystals, an approach that has been an important part of the investigation of several enzyme mechanisms. Here we report on the oxygen binding by single crystals of human haemoglobin grown in solutions of polyethylene glycol. Unlike haemoglobin crystals formed in concentrated salt solution, which crack and become disordered on oxygenation, crystals grown in polyethylene glycol remain intact. X-ray studies have shown that the T (deoxy) quaternary structure of haemoglobin in this crystal at pH 7.0 is maintained at atmospheric oxygen pressure, and that the salt-bridges are not broken. We find striking differences between oxygen binding by haemoglobin in this crystal and by haemoglobin in solution. Not only is oxygenation of the crystal noncooperative, but the oxygen affinity is independent of pH in the range 6.0-8.5, and is much lower than that of the T state in solution. The lack of cooperativity without a change in quaternary structure is predicted by the two-state allosteric model of Monod, Wyman and Changeux. The absence of a Bohr effect without breakage of salt-bridges is predicted by Perutz's stereochemical mechanism. In contrast to the X-ray result that oxygen binds only to the alpha haems, our measurements show that the alpha haems have only a slightly higher affinity than the beta haems.\r"

Animals were exposed to conventional fractionation (200 +/- 4 cGy/day, 5 days/week; total dose, 4000 cGy). Metabolic experiments were made 2 to 3 weeks after completion of the radiation exposure. In comparison with control and sham-irradiated animals, cerebral metabolic activity was diffusely decreased after irradiation. Statistically significant decreases in metabolic activity were observed in 13 of 27 brain regions studied. In general, the brain areas with the highest basal metabolic rates showed the greatest percentage of decrease in glucose utilization. The concept that radiation suppresses glucose utilization before any morphological change takes place in the cell structures was the basis of this study. Metabolic alterations after irradiation may explain the syndrome of early delayed deterioration observed in humans after whole-brain radiotherapy. These studies have applications to observations made with the [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose method in conjunction with positron emission tomographic scans in patients receiving radiation therapy for intracranial malignancies. The data reported here also have potential clinical implications for the evaluation of a risk/benefit ratio for radiotherapy in patients with benign neurosurgical diseases or children undergoing prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "We report 25 verified cases of well-differentiated cerebral astrocytomas in adults treated between 1978 and 1988. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) scans, with 5 undergoing a craniotomy for debulking and 20 undergoing a biopsy alone. The median survival for the entire group was 8.2 years, the longest survival yet reported for a series of patients with these tumors. A review of the literature suggests that the longer survival observed in more recent series is the result of the earlier diagnosis of tumors afforded by modern brain imaging. Twenty of our patients presented with seizures in the absence of any other focal findings and would probably not have had a biopsy in the era before CT scans until their tumors had progressed. Only 8% of our patients had papilledema at the time of presentation, in contrast to almost half of the patients with low-grade astrocytomas reported before 1975, supporting the hypothesis that patients in the CT era are diagnosed earlier. None of our patients died from progressive low-grade disease. One patient died from a squamous cell cancer, and 7 died as a consequence of their tumors dedifferentiating into a more malignant astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme, with a median time of approximately 5 years after the diagnosis. Our findings, together with the available data in the literature, suggest that death from a focal low-grade astrocytoma, in the absence of malignant degeneration, may be a rare event. Consequently, future therapeutic efforts should be targeted at preventing dedifferentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Guidelines for the use of multimodality therapy have not been developed for tumors associated with markedly elevated prolactin levels. We reviewed the records of 21 patients with prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/ml treated by transsphenoidal surgery and postoperative radiotherapy with or without a dopamine agonist. Values before and after treatment were available for 19 patients (13 men and 6 women). The mean basal prolactin level before treatment for the entire group was 2410 ng/ml. Surgery and radiotherapy resulted in a 90% reduction and serum prolactin levels within normal limits in 0 of 7 patients, versus the combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and dopamine agonist, which resulted in a 99.5% reduction and values within the normal range in 12 of 12 patients. Spontaneous physiological improvement was not often observed. One woman and two men were able subsequently to have children. A plan for these patients is discussed.\r"

Motor innervation to the diaphragm can be affected, and even the uppermost disc space at C2-C3 might be implicated. Findings on examination findings are sparse, although sensory impairment in areas of cervical plexus innervation has been observed. In a series of 1000 cervical decompression cases (both anterior and posterior) for disc disease or similar processes, only 10 instances of this syndrome have been found. Paresthesia or episodic shock-like pain affecting the ear, para-auricular, lower occipital, and mandibular areas prompted by head turning or extension are the most common complaints.\r"

  ".W": "We present our surgical experience with second operations in 15 patients with recurrent intractable partial seizures after resection for epilepsy. The interval from the first operation until the first recurrence of seizures ranged from 1 day to 7 months (mean, 62 days). The interval between the first and second operations ranged from 3 months to 12 years (mean, 38 months). Detailed video-electroencephalographic interictal and ictal recording was performed in all patients (invasive electrodes were used in 11 patients). Ictal onset was shown to be remote from the zone of previous resection in 3 of 15 cases (all 3 extratemporal and in the ipsilateral hemisphere). Recurrent seizures arose from the area of previous extratemporal resection in 2 of 15 patients, and from the area of previous temporal resection in 10 of 15 patients. Both cases of extratemporal recurrences and 3 of the 10 cases of temporal lobe recurrences in the area of previous resection were associated with residual unresected structural lesion. Of the 10 patients with local temporal recurrence, 6 had proven epileptogenicity in the residual mesial structures, and 4 had residual epileptogenicity in the unresected lateral temporal lobe. The patients have been monitored for 8 to 82 months (mean, 18 months) after the second operation: 7 patients (47%) have remained seizure-free and another 5 (33%) have achieved a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 90%. There was no mortality or significant morbidity in this series. We conclude that the extent and distribution of residual epileptogenicity after failed epilepsy surgery are highly variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy.\r"

A total of 276 consecutive surgical procedures for 317 intracranial aneurysms produced 41 perioperative or intraoperative ruptures for analysis. Five cases were pre-exposure ruptures, 3 of which occurred during anesthetic induction. Four of these patients died, and 1 made a good recovery. Of the remaining 36 cases, outcome was analyzed in terms of the adjuncts used to deal with the intraoperative rupture. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between those cases in which tamponade was used to control hemorrhage versus temporary clipping; however, those cases in which hypotension was used did less well than those in which it was not used. From October 1986 to October 1988, 108 operations for 132 aneurysms were performed without the use of induced hypotension. There were 16 intraoperative ruptures (14.8%). All 16 of these patients made a good recovery. In the group before 1986, of which there were 20 intraoperative ruptures (of 168 operations, 11.9%), 11 of those 20 patients suffered a permanent deficit or died. We conclude that hypotension may not be a necessary adjunct to the management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysms.\r"

These vessels mediate changes in cerebrovascular resistance and capacitance, respectively. Mean control vessel diameters of arterioles and venules at pH 7.3 were 53.9 +/- 2.8 microns and 78.4 +/- 4.3 microns, respectively. Both arterioles and venules dilated when the pH of the extraluminal solution was lowered to 6.8 and constricted when the pH was raised to 7.6. PB, 10(-6) to 10(-2) mol/L, dilated intracerebral arterioles in a dose-dependent manner at pH 7.3, reaching a maximal dilation of 129.7 +/- 3.1% of control diameter at a dose of 10(-3) mol/L. In contrast, PB at 10(-6) to 10(-2) mol/L failed to produce significant changes in the diameter of intracerebral venules. In addition, PB at 10(-3) mol/L significantly inhibited arteriolar constriction induced by KCl (120 mmol/L), but not venular constriction. The present study suggests that intracerebral venules are relatively less responsive to PB than cerebral arterioles and peripheral veins. In addition to its effect on cerebral metabolism. PB may act to redistribute venous blood volume from cerebral veins to more responsive peripheral veins, thereby decreasing intracranial blood volume and intracranial pressure.\r"

Twenty monkeys were divided into four groups of 5 animals each: 1) a control group of sham-operated animals, 2) animals subjected to angiography 3 days after the induction of SAH (3-day SAH), 3) animals subjected to angiography 7 days after SAH (1-week SAH), and 4) animals subjected to angiography 7 and 14 days after SAH (2-week SAH). To induce SAH, the main cerebral arteries on the right were dissected free of the arachnoid, and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries. To evaluate vasospasm, all animals underwent a baseline angiogram before SAH; angiography was repeated at different intervals in each group, as outlined above. Histopathological changes and the deposition of the immunoglobulin IgG in the arterial wall were evaluated immunohistochemically in each group. The cerebral arteries on the side of the clot showed evidence of mild vasospasm (-24.6% reduction) on the angiogram performed on Day 3, severe vasospasm (-51.7%) on Day 7, and mild vasospasm (-12.8%) on Day 14. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was most marked in the spastic arterial wall in the 1-week SAH group. In the 2-week SAH group, severe myonecrosis and intimal disruption were observed, even in the vessels that showed only mild vasospasm, and the inflammatory reactions had almost abated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results demonstrate a long-latency response (beginning at 8 milliseconds) elicited by electrical stimulation, which is distinct from the short-latency motor evoked potential previously reported. The conduction velocity of this later response is similar to that reported for the pyramidal tract in the rat. Experiments confirm that the longer latency response depends upon the integrity of the pyramidal system. Focal stimulation outside the sensorimotor cortex failed to elicit a response. Experimental lesions of the pyramidal tract or ablating the sensorimotor cortex eliminated the spinal cord evoked response. The results demonstrate that focal stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex results in a spinal cord evoked response that represents activity within the pyramidal system. The utility of this response in the rat model for assessing experimental cord injury is discussed.\r"

The most prominent intraoperative electrophysiological finding in these cases was a gradual deterioration of brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), especially of Wave V. Four additional patients with a similar gradual intraoperative loss of BAEP and severe postoperative hearing deterioration received vasoactive treatment after surgery (low-molecular weight dextran). In all 4 patients, including 1 patient with documented total deafness after surgery, hearing was preserved. Initial preservation of cochlear nerve function after the removal of an acoustic neurinoma does not guarantee postoperative hearing. Intraoperative BAEP help to identify patients at risk for delayed postoperative hearing loss. The pathophysiological mechanism can be attributed to disturbances of the microcirculation in endoneurial vasa nervorum caused by the mechanical manipulation of the cochlear nerve.\r"

The patient underwent emergency operative evacuation of the hematoma and an occipital-cervical fusion with internal fixation. He had a remarkable recovery in neurological function and achieved stable bony fusion 3 months postoperatively. With early recognition of this entity, improved neuroradiological imaging techniques, and aggressive treatment, patients may survive with significant neurological recovery.\r"

This analysis focused on 224 control children with birth weight of less than 2000 g. Bilirubin levels were maintained below previously specified levels by the use of exchange transfusion only (24%). Rates of cerebral palsy were not significantly higher for children with elevated maximum bilirubin level than for those whose level remained low. No association was evident between maximum bilirubin level and IQ (Full Scale, Verbal, or Performance) by simple correlation analysis (r = -.087, P = .2 for Full Scale) or by multiple linear regression adjusting for factors that covary with IQ (beta = -.15, P = .58). IQ was not associated with mean bilirubin level, time and duration of exposure to bilirubin, or measures of bilirubin-albumin binding. Thus, over the range of bilirubin levels permitted in this clinical trial, there was no evidence of bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system. Measures used to control the level of bilirubin in low birth weight neonates appear to prevent effectively the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity.\r"

In 1988, there were 249 deaths attributed to HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in children younger than 15 years of age. Associated causes of death listed most frequently on 270 death certificates with any mention of HIV/AIDS included conditions within the AIDS surveillance case definition (30%), pneumonia (excluding Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) (17%), septicemia (10%), and noninfectious respiratory diseases (8%). The impact of HIV/AIDS as a cause of death was most striking in the 1-through 4-year-old age group and in black and Hispanic children, particularly in the Northeast. By 1988 in New York State, HIV/AIDS was the first and second leading cause of death in Hispanic and black children 1 through 4 years of age, accounting for 15% and 16%, respectively, of all deaths in these age-race groups. With an estimated 1500 to 2000 HIV-infected children born in 1989, the impact of HIV on mortality in children will become more severe.\r"

The Centers for Disease Control received reports that hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HMA) had developed in 141 children as a result of exposure to these formulas. Thirty-five of these children were examined at 9 and 10 years of age and compared with a group of 32 children who were exposed to the chloride-deficient formulas but were not reported to experience HMA and a group of 61 children who received chloride-sufficient soy formulas in infancy. The control children were matched to the HMA children on sex, race, age, and maternal education. Growth characteristics, performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), the Boston Naming Test, the Rey-Osterrieth Test, the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised (CELF-R), and subtests from several other speech and language tests were compared across the groups. After adjustment for family income and the level of the father's education, significantly lower scores were observed in the HMA children on the WISC-R Arithmetic subtest (mean = 10.5) compared with the soy control children (mean = 12.0, P less than .05) and on the WISC-R Coding subtest (mean = 9.0) compared with the soy control children (mean = 10.8, P less than .01). All the WISC-R subtest scores were, however, within the normal range. Although no significant differences occurred on the CELF-R between groups, the risk of an HMA child falling below the range expected for a standard population was increased on the CELF-R Composite Total, Receptive, and Expressive Language scores: risk ratios = 2.14, 2.14, and 3.03 respectively. Significant differences were observed between the children exposed, both HMA and non-HMA children, and the soy control children for behavioral problems as determined by the Achenbach Childhood Behavioral Checklist. It is concluded that as a group, children with documented HMA appear to have recovered from their growth failure and have normal cognitive development. They may, however, be at risk for deficits in language skills that require expressive language abilities.\r"

A total of 113 children were studied: 62 children 3 to 5 months of age and 51 children 6 to 18 months of age. Sera were drawn prior to first and second immunization and 3 weeks after second immunization and were tested by hemagglutination inhibition; protection was defined as greater than 1:32. Ninety-five children were surveyed for adverse reactions. Seroresponses were age and antigen specific. Best responses for all ages were to A/Mississippi (H3N2) (97%). Children older than 6 months of age had better seroresponses to A/Leningrad (H3N2) (73%, P less than .03) and B/Victoria (62%, P less than .02) than did children younger than 6 months of age. Seroconversion rates to the remaining antigens were low. Only 9% of children experienced adverse reactions; all but one were mild. The immunologic mechanisms responsible for preventing serious influenzal disease and more effective immunization strategies need to be defined for very young high-risk children.\r"

Milk intake of 73 exclusively breast-fed infants was measured by 4-day test-weighing, correcting for insensible water loss. Total volume extracted was assessed by a combination of test-weighing and expression of breast contents during a subsequent 24-hour period. Residual milk volume was calculated as volume extracted minus intake. Intake, volume extracted, and residual milk volume averaged 818, 914, and 109 g/d, respectively. The interindividual coefficient of variation in intake (16.3%) was greater than within-individual day-to-day variation (8.9%). In comparing those with low (less than 650 g/d) vs average intake, there was no significant difference in residual milk volume between groups (85 vs 111 g/d), indicating that infants with low intakes left as much milk unconsumed as those with higher intakes. There were no differences between groups in maternal age, parity, or anthropometric indices. Infants with low intakes were smaller and spent less time nursing, even though their mothers reportedly nursed on demand. In linear regressions, none of the maternal variables was significantly correlated with intake, volume extracted, or residual milk volume. Infant birth weight, weight at 3 months, and total time nursing were positively associated with intake. The results suggest that infant demand is the main determinant of lactation performance in populations such as this.\r"

This study tests the hypotheses that (1) more adolescents report early first-trimester vaginal bleeding than do adults and (2) a history of vaginal bleeding is associated with later entry into prenatal care, particularly among adolescents. Reports of early vaginal bleeding were prospectively obtained from black, predominantly primiparous, unmarried poor women (136 adolescents and 53 adults). As hypothesized, more adolescents reported early first-trimester vaginal bleeding than did adults (16.9% vs 5.7%; P less than .01). Adolescents who reported early vaginal bleeding also entered prenatal care later (16.2 weeks) than did adolescents who reported no bleeding (12.7 weeks) (P less than .03); this was not true for adults. If dating of the gestation is based solely on last menstrual period history, inflation of the incidence of preterm births to adolescents and the mean birth weights of those preterm neonates may occur. The findings suggest that new strategies focusing on the recognition of menstrual irregularities as a symptom of pregnancy may be needed to promote early prenatal care among adolescents. Additionally, adolescent pregnancies should be dated by both ultrasound and Dubowitz examinations.\r"

In this study, we assess the frequency of apneic pauses during quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in control infants and infants who subsequently died of SIDS. Sleep states were identified in 12-hour physiological recordings of SIDS victims and matched control infants, and the number of respiratory pauses from 4 to 30 seconds in duration was computed for quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. SIDS victims 40 to 65 days of age showed significantly fewer apneic pauses than did age-matched control infants across the two sleep states. Fewer short respiratory pauses accounted for most of the reduction in number of apneic events in the SIDS victims during both sleep states. During the first month of life, SIDS victims did not differ significantly from control neonates on this measure. The finding that this respiratory difference exists during the second month of life, just before the period of maximal risk for SIDS, but not earlier, may have implications for the etiology of SIDS deaths.\r"

The tracheostomies were for severe subglottic narrowing precluding the passage of an adequate size endotracheal tube in 10 children, and for severe endotracheal tube trauma in 17 children. Five children developed acquired subglottic stenosis (2.4% of 208) and 1 of these has a retained tracheostomy. One child died of cardiac disease. The remaining 202 children had no long-term complications of laryngotracheobronchitis, intubation, or tracheostomy. It is concluded that nasotracheal intubation is a satisfactory artificial airway for laryngotracheobronchitis. Endoscopic evaluation in a selected group of these children will identify those with significant intubation trauma or severe subglottic narrowing in whom continued intubation may cause permanent subglottic damage. The low incidence of acquired subglottic stenosis in this series supports the practice of selective endoscopy and tracheostomy.\r"

  ".W": "To test the commonly held premise that prematurity is a risk factor for problems of behavior and social interaction, as well as cognitive and physical development, temperament and behavior of children born preterm and full-term control subjects were compared at five separate time periods from infancy through early school age. All the preterm infants (n = 126) of a representative group of infants enrolled in a longitudinal study (n = 2443) were surveyed at 4 to 8 months corrected age. Subsamples of the group were studied further in successive years as young toddlers (n = 65), older toddlers (n = 60), preschoolers (n = 84), and at early school age (n = 81). At each period there were no differences between those studied and those not studied on socioeconomic status, gestational age, sex, or birth order. Parental ratings of temperament and behavior were used at appropriate ages: the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire, the Toddler Temperament Scale, the Childhood Temperament Questionnaire, Behaviour Checklist, Preschool Behaviour Questionnaire, and Rutter's Childhood Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ), as well as mother's overall rating of temperament. In infancy there were no significant differences on temperament dimensions, clinical temperament categories, or parental ratings of individual or composite behaviors between the preterm and full-term groups. For toddlers, temperament scores were similar for the two groups but preterm subjects were significantly more likely (P less than .01) to have an easy temperament and less likely to have a difficult temperament. There were no differences on any of the other temperament or behavior ratings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 149 living young black primiparas in the original cohort, 121 (81%) were located and interviewed. At follow-up the study population ranged in age from 32 to 38 years, 68% were unmarried, 71% had finished high school, 82% were completely self-supporting, and 27% reported living in public housing. Long-term success, defined as currently employed or supported by a spouse and a high school education (62%) or its equivalent, was associated with six features: having completed more school prior to becoming pregnant (odds ratio [OR] = 18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3, 139.5); participating more actively in a program intervention offered to these pregnant teenagers 20 years ago (OR = 11.11; 95% CI 1.54, 79.87); being in school with no subsequent pregnancy at 26 months postpartum (OR = 10.1; 95% CI 1.64, 62.07); feeling in control of one's life (OR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.36, 21.54) and little social isolation (OR = 8.24; 95% CI 1.56, 43.50) at 26 months postpartum; and lifetime fertility control defined as one or two children after the index child (OR = 14.19; 95% CI 3.28, 61.29).

This work was undertaken to identify risk factors for suicide attempts among bisexual and homosexual male youth. Subjects were 137 gay and bisexual males, 14 through 21 years of age, from the upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest. Forty-one subjects (41/137) reported a suicide attempt; and almost half of them described multiple attempts. Twenty-one percent of all attempts resulted in medical or psychiatric admissions. Compared with non-attempters, attempters had more feminine gender roles and adopted a bisexual or homosexual identity at younger ages. Attempters were more likely than peers to report sexual abuse, drug abuse, and arrests for misconduct. The findings parallel previous studies' results and also introduce novel suicide risk factors related to gender nonconformity and sexual milestones.\r"

To determine their knowledge and attitudes toward HIV transmission, 219 parents in 4 day care centers and 176 care providers in 12 day care centers were given confidential questionnaires. More than 98% of respondents knew that sex and needle sharing can transmit HIV; 84% of parents and 77% of care providers knew that contact with blood can transmit HIV. There was, however, uncertainty about transmission via many common contacts in day care centers: human bites, urine, stool, tears, and vomit; kissing; sharing of food and eating utensils; and diaper changing areas. Only 43% of parents said they would allow their child to stay in the same room with a child who was infected with HIV. In a multiple logistic regression model, the unwillingness of parents to have their child stay in the same room with a child who was infected with HIV was significantly (P less than .0001) associated with black ethnicity, beliefs that such a child is likely to infect others (40%) and is dangerous to others (58%), and fear of their child being exposed to HIV (86%). Care providers' unwillingness to care for a child infected with HIV in the classroom (48%) was significantly (P less than .0001) associated with beliefs that such a child is likely to infect others (44%) and that common day care center contacts can transmit HIV (62%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data were derived from the Ontario Child Health Study of 1869 randomly selected families, with 3294 children aged 4 to 16 years. In the absence of significant differences between parents and families of children with chronic illness alone and those with physical disability, these groups were combined for analysis, for which odds ratios (OR) or t tests were used. Significant positive findings included increased rates of parental treatment for \"nerves\" (mothers' OR = 2.1, fathers' OR = 1.9) and increased maternal negative affect scores (Bradburn Affect Balance Scale) (P less than .001) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Important negative findings (95% confidence interval of the OR included 1) included no increase in single-parent families (OR = 1.2), social isolation (OR = 1.0), or alcohol problems (OR = 1.2) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Categorically defined family dysfunction did not differ between the two groups (OR = 1.1). These data contrast with several clinic-based studies and suggest that, in a widely generalizable population survey, families of children with chronic health problems including physical disability do not suffer a marked excess of dysfunction, although some indicators of individual parent psychosocial problems were modestly elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Characteristic historical features included prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal illness, vaginal delivery, and onset of illness within the first 10 days of life. Clinical findings included lethargy, fever or hypothermia, anorexia, apnea, hepatomegaly, bleeding, and progressive pneumonia. Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hepatitis were typical laboratory manifestations. Illness was severe and generally unremitting; only two survivors have been reported. Pathologic changes were prominent in lung, liver, and brain. Virus isolates, predominantly serotypes 3, 7, 21, and 30 were obtained from multiple sites and organs. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that viral acquisition from the mother, perhaps via the birth canal, is a major mode of transmission. Neonatal adenovirus infection, which is frequently disseminated and generally fatal, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia.\r"

Patients were urban (100%), minority (97%) children with few alternative means for keeping cool. Injuries occurred on extremely hot summer days (mean maximum temperature 36.3 degrees C [97.5 degrees F]). Laceration of the foot on broken glass was the most common injury and was prevented by wearing footwear (P less than .001). Motor vehicles caused all serious injuries. Sprinkler attachments on the hydrants were associated with significantly fewer motor vehicle-related injuries (P less than .001) and water pressure-related injuries (P = .02). Adults were present at more than 90% of injury scenes, but had no effect on the safety of fire hydrant play. Public policy should be directed toward increasing the availability of alternative means for keeping cool, increasing the number of hydrants equipped with sprinklers, and reducing the amount of broken glass in the streets. Public education targeting adults to remove glass from the street, insist that children wear footwear, and open only those hydrants that have sprinklers could further reduce injuries to urban children who play in water from fire hydrants.\r"

  ".W": "This article examines 1989 Medicaid physician reimbursement for pediatric care in 47 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the adequacy of payment, several state reimbursement policies were analyzed, including physician payment methods, frequency of payment updates, and fee data for five common evaluation and management codes and two Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment visit categories. Physician payment rates were evaluated to determine overall state and regional patterns of Medicaid reimbursement. They were also compared with regional private market fee data and average national Medicare fees to assess their adequacy. The majority of state Medicaid programs used fixed fee schedules as their physician reimbursement method. Nearly one fourth of states that update their fees overall by physician specialty have not adjusted their rates since 1985 or before. Medicaid reimbursement rates for five commonly used evaluation and management Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology (4th ed) office visit codes and Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment screening and follow-up examinations varied substantially across states and among regions. States in the West paid the highest rates for most office visits, while Northeastern states generally paid the least. A comparison of Medicaid payment rates with private market fee data revealed that Medicaid payments for established patients averaged less than two thirds of market rates for pediatricians, family physicians, and general practitioners. New patient care is reimbursed somewhat better. Regional variations are substantial. In addition, a comparison of Medicaid payment rates with 1988 Medicare fee data showed that average Medicaid reimbursement rates were less than four fifths of average allowed Medicare charges. Policy implications include the need to increase Medicaid rates so that they are much closer to private insurance and Medicare rates, particularly in the Northeast and in selected states, in order to increase participation by pediatric providers in Medicaid. In addition, efforts to re-evaluate reimbursement relative to level of service, as used in Medicare's resource-based relative value scales, deserve further research. Finally, comparable access to comprehensive pediatric care especially in underserved urban areas will require not only improvements in physician reimbursement but also more deliberate efforts to affect the maldistribution of mainstream medical care. Approaches to measure the impact of enhanced reimbursement on access to care by Medicaid-eligible children are discussed.\r"

The mean titers in plasma were 7 and 165 tissue culture-infective doses per milliliter in 9 children with asymptomatic (P-1) and 12 with symptomatic (P-2) infection, respectively (P = .0013). Significantly higher viral titers were found in PBMCs obtained from P-2 compared with P-1 children: 1920 vs 25 tissue culture-infective doses per 10(6) PBMC (P = .0018). In symptomatic patients at least 1 in 520 circulating mononuclear cells harbored HIV-1. No correlation was found between the viral burden and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. A decrease in the HIV-1 titers was noted both in PBMCs and plasma of symptomatic patients treated with zidovudine for 2 to 7 months. It is concluded that symptomatic children harbor a higher amount of the virus in plasma and PBMCs than asymptomatic children. Zidovudine treatment for 2 months or more decreased the amount of HIV-1 in PBMCs and plasma.\r"

Children underwent neuropsychological testing. The patients completed self-esteem scales and their parents and teachers completed behavior rating scales. Peer relationships were examined with the Pupil Evaluation Inventory, which is a sociometric questionnaire completed by the child's classmates and provides measures of aggression, withdrawal, and likability. As a group, Tourette's disorder patients were significantly more withdrawn, more aggressive, and less popular than their classmates. Thirty-five percent of the children with Tourette's disorder received the lowest rating in the class on one or more of the Pupil Evaluation Inventory factors. These social problems were not predicted by the frequency or duration of tics. A clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and teachers' ratings on the summary scale of the Child Behavior Checklist and the Pupil Evaluation Inventory did predict poor adjustment. It is concluded that social adjustment is a major difficulty for many children with Tourette's disorder, irrespective of tic severity.\r"

  ".W": "We show here that mammalian site-specific recombination and DNA-repair pathways share a common factor. The effects of DNA-damaging agents on cell lines derived from mice homozygous for the scid (severe combined immune deficiency) mutation were studied. Surprisingly, all scid cell lines exhibited a profound hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that caused double-strand breaks (x-irradiation and bleomycin) but not to other chemicals that caused single-strand breaks or cross-links. Neutral filter elution assays demonstrated that the x-irradiation hypersensitivity could be correlated with a deficiency in repairing double-strand breaks. These data suggest that the scid gene product is involved in two pathways: DNA repair of random double-strand breaks and the site-specific and lymphoid-restricted variable-(diversity)-joining [V(D)J] DNA rearrangement process. We propose that the scid gene product performs a similar function in both pathways and may be a ubiquitous protein.\r"

Cardiac Na channels were expressed in oocytes following injection of RNA from guinea pig, rat, and human heart and detailed analysis was performed for guinea pig cardiac Na channels. Average current amplitudes were -351 +/- 37 nA with peak current observed at -8 +/- 1 mV. Steady-state inactivation was half-maximal at -49 +/- 0.6 mV for the expressed channels. All heart Na currents were resistant to block by tetrodotoxin compared to Na currents expressed from brain RNA with IC50 values for guinea pig, rat, and human heart of 651 nM, 931 nM, and 1.3 microM, respectively. In contrast, rat brain Na channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin with an IC50 value of 9.1 nM. In addition, the effects of the cardiac-selective agents lidocaine and DPI 201-106 were examined on Na currents expressed from brain and heart RNA. Lidocaine (10 microM) blocked cardiac Na current in a use-dependent manner but had no effect on brain Na currents. DPI 201-106 (10 microM) slowed the rate of cardiac Na channel inactivation but had no effect on inactivation of brain Na channels. These results indicate the Xenopus oocyte system is capable of synthesizing and expressing cardiac Na channels that retain normal physiological and pharmacological properties.\r"

  ".W": "The synthesis of a gene coding for horseradish peroxidase (HRP, isozyme c; EC 1.11.1.7) is described using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated gene synthesis approach developed in our laboratory. In this approach, all the oligonucleotides making up the gene are ligated in a single step by using the two outer oligonucleotides as PCR primers and the crude ligation mixture as the target. The PCR facilitates synthesis and purification of the gene simultaneously. The gene for HRP was synthesized by ligating all 40 oligonucleotides in a single step followed by PCR amplification. The gene was also synthesized from its fragments by using an overlap extension method similar to the procedure as described [Horton, R. M., Hunt, H. D., Ho, S. N., Pullen, J. K. & Pease, L. R. (1989) Gene 77, 61-68]. A method for combining different DNA fragments, in-frame, by using the PCR was also developed and used to synthesize the HRP gene from its gene fragments. This method is applicable to the synthesis of even larger genes and to combine any DNA fragments in-frame. After the synthesis, preliminary characterization of the HRP gene was also carried out by the PCR to confirm the arrangement of oligonucleotides in the gene. This was done by carrying out the PCR with several sets of primers along the gene and comparing the product sizes with the expected sizes. The gene and the fragments generated by PCR were cloned in Escherichia coli and the sequence was confirmed by manual and automated DNA sequencing.\r"

Furthermore, trypsin treatment of the 32P-labeled OBF1 revealed several phosphorylated peptides, suggesting that OBF1 is multiply phosphorylated in vivo. Incubation of phosphorylated peptides with calf intestinal phosphatase liberated the radiolabel as free phosphate, indicating a phosphoester linkage. Acid hydrolysis of the tryptic peptides revealed 32P-label label comigrating with phosphoserine; some of it, however, was also identified as phosphothreonine. Using anti-OBF1 antibodies, we cloned the OBF1 gene from a lambda gt11 yeast expression library. The DNA sequence of the isolated gene and its over-expression in yeast indicated that OBF1 is identical to ABF-1 and BAF1 proteins, believed to have a role in transcriptional repression and activation. Therefore, we suggest that OBF1 is a multifunctional protein, acting in transcription and replication, and that these activities are regulated by phosphorylation.\r"

Primer extension analysis indicated that alpha 4 mRNA extended well beyond the 5' end of this cDNA. To clone this 5' sequence, a primer extension cDNA library was constructed, and a cDNA extending an additional 660 base pairs was isolated. This cDNA hybridized to multiple mRNAs in both T and B lymphocytes, but no alpha 4 mRNA was found in different tissues or in adherent cell lines. A single alpha 4 gene was detected in a genomic Southern blot when hybridization was done at high stringency; however, additional bands were observed at lower stringency, indicating the presence of alpha 4-related genes. Some of the different mRNAs that hybridize to the alpha 4 cDNA may then be the products of these related genes. Analysis of the alpha 4 genomic sequence revealed a large first exon of 958 base pairs. Interestingly, translation of alpha 4 initiates from the second ATG in this exon (nucleotide + 744). The first ATG (nucleotide +21) is followed by a termination codon 21 amino acids downstream. Such upstream ATG codons have been implicated in translational control of protooncogenes. One major transcriptional start site was identified by using S1 nuclease and primer extension mapping. Consensus sequences for DNA regulatory elements were found upstream of the gene and in exon 1 and intron 1. The alpha 4 gene 5' flanking region acted as a promoter in transfection assays. Detailed characterization of the promoter should provide insight into molecular events regulating expression and tissue specificity of alpha 4.\r"

The transformants permissive for poliovirus were able to bind the virus and were also recognized by monoclonal antibody D171, which competes with poliovirus for the cellular receptor. These results strongly suggest that the poliovirus binding site resides in domain I of the receptor. Mutant cDNAs for the sequence encoding the intracellular peptide were also constructed and expressed in mouse L cells. Susceptibility of these cells to poliovirus revealed that the entire putative cytoplasmic domain is not essential for virus infection. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule appears not to play a role in the penetration of poliovirus.\r"

Increasing the duration of nucleosome assembly progressively inactivated a plasmid template when it was transcribed with extracts of either unshocked or heat-shocked Drosophila embryos, despite induction of the transcriptional activator heat shock factor. Addition of the general transcription factor IID (TFIID) before nucleosome assembly did not significantly relieve nucleosomal inhibition, but TFIID potentiated the promoter to be responsive to activation by heat shock factor in the heat shock transcription extract. The potentiation by TFIID could be related to the nucleosome-free, hypersensitive state of heat shock promoters previously observed in vivo before heat shock induction and may be necessitated by the need to expedite activation of heat shock genes in response to environmental stress.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the p53 gene plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and malignant transformation. Overexpression of mutant forms of p53 is in fact a common feature of many transformed cells. Studies dealing with the transcriptional regulatory regions of the p53 gene indicate that, unlike most promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the p53 promoter contains no TATA-like sequence upstream of the transcription start site. Here we demonstrate that the murine p53 promoter contains a cis-acting element that maps downstream to the transcription initiation site. The integrity of this element is required for high-level expression from the promoter in transformed cells. By DNase I protection and mobility-shift analysis, we show that a nuclear factor binds to this downstream element through the consensus recognition sequence for the helix-loop-helix (HLH)-containing proteins of the myc/MyoD family of transcriptional regulators. We propose that the activity of one or more members of this family of transcription factors is an important determinant in the expression of p53 and that at least one level of p53 overexpression in transformed cells may thus be due to aberrant expression of the relevant factor(s). Furthermore, the possibility that the regulation of expression of p53 occurs, in part, by means of a potential HLH-containing factor provides a possible mechanism for the suppression of proliferation by the MyoD family of transcriptional regulators.\r"

The cellular promoter and 5' flanking sequence (positions -613 to +32) were derived from the rat alpha-myosin heavy chain gene whose expression in vivo is restricted to cardiac muscle and is positively regulated by thyroid hormone. After DNA injection, activity of the firefly luciferase gene coupled to the myosin heavy chain promoter and regulatory sequence was detected in heart but not in skeletal muscle and was significantly increased in response to thyroid hormone treatment. Consequently, expression of injected genes can be targeted to specific cell types in vivo and can be modulated by the hormonal status of the animal. This approach provides a means of mapping the elements of genes that regulate their responses to complex stimuli that cannot be modeled in vitro.\r"

We now report the cloning and expression of both human CLMF subunit cDNAs from a lymphoblastoid B-cell line, NC-37. The two subunits represent two distinct and unrelated gene products whose mRNAs are coordinately induced upon activation of NC-37 cells. Coexpression of the two subunit cDNAs in COS cells is necessary for the secretion of biologically active CLMF; COS cells transfected with either subunit cDNA alone do not secrete bioactive CLMF. Recombinant CLMF expressed in mammalian cells displays biologic activities essentially identical to natural CLMF, and its activities can be neutralized by monoclonal antibodies prepared against natural CLMF. Since this heterodimeric protein displays the properties of an interleukin, we propose that CLMF be given the designation interleukin 12.\r"

  ".W": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, stimulates immune responses by activating macrophages, B lymphocytes, and other cells of the immune system. The mechanisms by which LPS activates these cells are poorly characterized. Since protein tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be a major intracellular signaling event that mediates cellular responses, we examined whether LPS alters tyrosine phosphorylation in macrophages. We found that Escherichia coli K235 LPS increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line and in resident peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeSNJ mice. Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were detectable by 4-5 min, reached a maximum by 15 min, and declined after 30-60 min. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation increased following stimulation with LPS at 100 pg/ml and was maximal with 10 ng/ml. Similar changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were induced by Salmonella minnesota R595 LPS and by the biologically active domain of LPS, lipid A, but not by the inactive lipid A derivative N2-monoacylglucosamine 1-phosphate. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, but some of the modulated proteins were different than those phosphorylated by LPS. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, inhibited both LPS-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and LPS-stimulated release of arachidonic acid metabolites. Thus, increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a rapid LPS-activated signaling event that may mediate release of arachidonic acid metabolites in RAW 264.7 cells.\r"

The present study examined the developmental pattern of GluR-1, -2, and -3 gene expression in rat brain. In situ hybridization revealed different spatial patterns throughout the brain for the cognate mRNAs at all ages examined, as well as different temporal patterns during development. In the adult all three mRNAs were expressed prominently in the pyramidal and granule layers of the hippocampus and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, where detailed differences were apparent at the cellular level. In neocortex, GluR-2 mRNA exhibited prominent lamination and regional differences, which were less marked for GluR-1 and -3 mRNAs. In caudate-putamen GluR-2 mRNA was at high levels, but GluR-1 and -3 mRNAs were not. At early ages transcripts were transiently elevated relative to adult levels. GluR-1 mRNA reached peak expression in cortex at postnatal day 14 (P14) (225% of adult), in striatum at P4 (255% of adult), in hippocampus at P14 (195% of adult), and in cerebellum at P21 (150% of adult). GluR-3 exhibited more modest peaks in neocortex and hippocampus. In contrast, GluR-2 mRNA was at near adult levels throughout the first days of postnatal life and exhibited a peak only in cerebellum at P14 (168% of adult). The finding of differential developmental regulation of the GluR-1, -2, and -3 genes indicates that the receptors they encode may have different influences on synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and susceptibility to excitatory amino acid toxicity.\r"

PE induced by local infusion of bradykinin, which we have previously shown to depend on the sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal, was markedly enhanced by coinfusion of either ATP or the adenosine A2-receptor agonist 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenos ine. Bradykinin-induced PE was inhibited by coinfusion of the ATP receptor antagonist adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene]triphosphate, the A2-receptor antagonist 3-(5H-thiozolo[2,3b]quinazolin-3-yl)phenol monohydrochloride, or the adenosine A1-receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine. The joint injury associated with experimental arthritis, which is reduced in severity in sympathectomized rats, was also markedly attenuated by daily administration of either ATP (40% reduction) or adenosine (55% reduction). These results demonstrate that the purines ATP and adenosine (acting at the A2 receptor), cotransmitters in the sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal, enhance bradykinin-induced sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal-dependent PE but inhibit the joint injury of arthritis. These opposing purinergic effects on PE and joint injury suggest that enhanced PE protects against joint injury.\r"

This cDNA was subsequently used to screen libraries derived from the human cell lines MCF-7 and WI38 and led to the isolation of full-length cDNA clones. DNA sequence analysis identified an open reading frame of 1440 base pairs encoding a protein of 480 amino acids (Mr, 55,716). This result was supported by the synthesis of a Mr 58,000 protein in an in vitro translation system that used RNA transcribed from cloned cDNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase. The predicted protein contains consensus sequences characteristic of a protein kinase catalytic domain and shows 73% and 68% similarity to protein kinase C and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. Northern (RNA) analysis revealed a single mRNA transcript of 3.2 kilobases that varied up to 300-fold between different cell lines. Specific antisera directed towards the carboxyl terminal of the rac protein kinase were prepared and used to identify that phosphorylated several substrates in immunoprecipitates prepared with the rac-specific antisera.\r"

Much recent evidence has led to the surprising conclusion that there are two acid-denatured states: one highly unfolded and the other more compact, sometimes called the \"molten globule.\" Here we describe a molecular theory for electrostatic stability of globular proteins based on the properties of the constituent amino acids: oil/water partition coefficients, pK values of the titratable groups, and their temperature dependences. Predicted denaturation temperatures vs. pH are in good agreement with experiments of other workers on myoglobin. The theory also predicts two populations of denatured species, one open and the other more compact, with densities in the range found experimentally for molten globular states. In addition, it predicts a phase diagram (stability vs. pH, ionic strength) in good agreement with experiments of Goto and Fink [Goto, Y. & Fink, A. L. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 945-952; and Goto, Y. & Fink, A. L. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 214, 803-805]. The well-known salt destabilization of myoglobin has been generally considered evidence for ion pairing, but the present theory, based on smeared charge repulsion, explains the salt destabilization at low pH without ion pairing. In addition, for myoglobin the theory predicts salt stabilization at high pH, as observed for beta-lactamase by Goto and Fink.\r"

Wild-type HBV was detected in 31 of 42 (73.8%) HBeAg-positive patients, whereas a mixed viral population was present in 10 (23.8%). Significant differences in the severity and outcome of liver disease were not observed in the two groups of patients. However, the emergence of HBeAg-minus HBV in wild-type HBV carriers was associated with an exacerbation of liver disease and was followed by the presence of antibodies against HBeAg (anti-HBe) in serum in 50% of the cases. In 61 of 64 (95.3%) anti-HBe-positive patients, HBeAg-minus HBV was the predominant virus: HBeAg-minus HBV was detected in 42 patients (65.6%), whereas both wild-type and HBeAg-minus HBV were present in 19 (29.7%). HBeAg-minus HBV was associated with a course of hepatitis characterized by flare-ups of liver cell necrosis interspersed with periods of asymptomatic HBV carriage (P less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity of HBV significantly influences the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis B. Wild-type HBV secreting HBeAg induces immunologic tolerance and causes chronic infection. HBeAg-minus HBV might be unable to induce chronic infection without the helper function of wild-type HBV, but it appears to be more pathogenic. Once chronic infection is established, HBeAg-minus HBV variants may prevail and displace wild-type virus.\r"

Estrogens circulate at high levels in blood of male songbirds and persist after castration. We measured the activity of aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, in various tissues from adult male and female zebra finches. As expected, aromatase activity was present in male hypothalamus/preoptic area and pituitary and female ovary, but aromatase was unusually active in whole telencephalon of males and females. By contrast, activity was undetected in testes, adrenals, or other tissues of males. These results suggest that brain is the source of circulating estrogens in the male zebra finch and that estrogen actions on the song system result from local rather than peripheral aromatization.\r"

  ".W": "A globular protein adopts its native three-dimensional structure spontaneously under physiological conditions. This structure is specified by a stereochemical code embedded within the amino acid sequence of that protein. Elucidation of this code is a major, unsolved challenge, known as the protein-folding problem. A critical aspect of the code is thought to involve molecular packing. Globular proteins have high packing densities, a consequence of the fact that residue side chains within the molecular interior fit together with an exquisite complementarity, like pieces of a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle [Richards, F. M. (1977) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 6, 151]. Such packing interactions are widely viewed as the principal determinant of the native structure. To test this view, we analyzed proteins of known structure for the presence of preferred interactions, reasoning that if side-chain complementarity is an important source of structural specificity, then sets of residues that interact favorably should be apparent. Our analysis leads to the surprising conclusion that high packing densities--so characteristic of globular proteins--are readily attainable among clusters of the naturally occurring hydrophobic amino acid residues. It is anticipated that this realization will simplify approaches to the protein-folding problem.\r"

We find that much of the increased expression of class I heterodimers is dependent on culturing RMA-S cells in bovine serum or with purified bovine beta 2-microglobulin. Furthermore, epitopes that are associated with class I MHC molecules that have bound xenogeneic beta 2-microglobulin are preferentially formed on RMA-S cells cultured at 25 degrees C. These heterologous class I molecules are thermolabile. Increased expression of class I molecules has also been observed on RMA-S cells incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of class I-restricted peptides. We find that the increased expression of Db molecules induced by influenza virus nucleoprotein residues 365-380 is similarly dependent on culturing RMA-S cells in bovine serum or with purified bovine beta 2-microglobulin.\r"

Procedures of combined in situ hybridization, allowing the simultaneous detection of two mRNAs in the same section or in adjacent sections, were used to characterize the phenotypes of the neurons expressing the D1 receptor gene. D1 receptor mRNA was found in neurons all over the caudate-putamen, the accumbens nucleus, and the olfactory tubercle but not in the substantia nigra. In the caudate-putamen and accumbens nucleus, most of the neurons containing D1 receptor mRNA were characterized as medium-sized substance P neurons and distinct from those containing D2 receptor mRNA. Nevertheless, 15-20% of the substance P neurons did not contain D1 receptor mRNA. The neurons containing preproenkephalin A mRNA did not contain D1 receptor mRNA but contained D2 receptor mRNA. A small number of cholinergic and somatostatinergic neurons exhibited a weak reaction for D1 receptor mRNA. These results demonstrate that dopamine acts on efferent striatal neurons through expression of distinct receptors--namely, D1 and D2 in separate cell populations (substance P and preproenkephalin A neurons, respectively)--and can also act on nonprojecting neurons through D1 receptor expression.\r"

In various types of cells, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced elevations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) have been reported to be uniform in single cells or originate at discrete sites from which they then propagate throughout the cells. These observations so far imply that a single cell functions as a minimal unit for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ signaling. In this study, we examined the effects of histamine on [Ca2+]i of type-2 astrocytes using fura-2-based digital imaging fluorescence microscopy and found an unusual type of Ca2+ signaling in these cells. Histamine induced [Ca2+]i elevation in type-2 astrocytes by means of histamine H1 receptors. Submaximal concentrations of histamine (10(-7)-10(-6) M) evoked multiple sites of oscillatory [Ca2+]i elevation in single type-2 astrocytes. These Ca2+ \"hot spots\" were localized in the processes of the astrocytes but not in the cell bodies. The time courses of [Ca2+]i oscillations in different hot spots were not synchronized, indicating that each of them formed an independent compartment of Ca2+ signaling. When higher concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M) of histamine were added, [Ca2+]i in the processes remained elevated at high levels and [Ca2+]i elevations propagated from the processes to the cell bodies. These results suggest that individual processes of type-2 astrocytes can form minimal units for Ca2+ signaling in response to submaximal concentrations of histamine and that single type-2 astrocytes may function as multiple units for Ca2+ signaling.\r"

Among normal human dermal cells, mast cells are the predominant cell type that expresses both TNF-alpha protein and TNF-alpha mRNA. Moreover, induction of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 expression is a direct consequence of release of mast cell-derived TNF-alpha. These findings establish a role for human mast cells as \"gatekeepers\" of the dermal microvasculature and indicate that mast cell products other than vasoactive amines influence endothelium in a proinflammatory fashion.\r"

The size and amino acid composition of this protein agree with those determined for the purified 51-kDa subunit. Furthermore, this protein contains a putative NADH-binding domain, a possible FMN-binding site, and a putative binding site for an iron-sulfur cluster. The above evidence indicates that the cloned protein is the 51-kDa subunit or its precursor. A search for sequence similarity with proteins in the Protein Identification Resource data base has revealed that the 51-kDa subunit has 32% amino acid sequence identity with a major portion of the alpha subunit of the soluble NAD(+)-reducing hydrogenase from Alcaligenes eutrophus.

Results show that a bipolar square wave is, at least, 1.7- and 5.5-fold more efficient than the unipolar square wave and single square pulse, respectively. In the range of electric field strength used for optimum transfection, the survivability of electropermeabilized cells was comparable between the unipolar and bipolar square waves but fell considerably with the single square pulse. Qualitative comparison of cell permeabilization induced by the three types of wave forms and monitored by ethidium bromide uptake revealed that only the bipolar square wave permeabilizes the cell membrane symmetrically at the two hemispheres facing the electrodes. With unipolar square wave or single square pulse, the membrane is permeabilized either on one side or asymmetrically. Taken together, our result suggests that permeabilization of the membrane at multiple sites without affecting cell survivability may account for the improvements in transfection efficiency observed with bipolar oscillating electric fields.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin, originally purified from porcine aortic endothelial cells, is widely distributed in tissues and is recognized as a product of epithelial cells, glial cells, and neurons in addition to endothelial cells. We found evidence by mRNA content and immunoreactivity that this peptide is synthesized in rat parathyroid epithelial cells (PT-r cells) and bovine parathyroid chief cells. The peptide synthesized by PT-r cells comigrated with synthetic endothelin 1 in reverse-phase HPLC and was diluted out in radioimmunoassay in parallel with the synthetic peptide. Bovine parathyroid endothelial cells (BPE-1 cells) did not express this peptide. Preproendothelin 1 mRNA expression by PT-r cells and endothelin 1 peptide production were regulated by calcium. Shifts in extracellular calcium either from high to low concentrations or vice versa elicited similar evanescent increases in expression of mRNA with a peak at 1 h. Synthesis of the peptide seems to be controlled by mRNA expression, and peptide in the medium appears to be continuously degraded or taken up by cells because its concentration in the medium showed a time course similar to that of mRNA expression. PT-r cells also bear a single class of receptors highly specific for endothelin 1, suggesting an autocrine regulation by endothelin 1 of the parathyroid. The facile regulation of endothelin concentrations in the medium by shifts in extracellular calcium concentration and possible autocrine regulation by endothelin 1 suggest that this peptide may mediate, at least in part, effects of calcium on the parathyroid system.\r"

The asymmetric unit is an elongated tetramer of dimensions 110 x 40 x 30 A, composed of two dimers related by pseudo twofold symmetry. Each monomer consists of two homologous layers, each with four antiparallel beta-strands. The two regions are connected by a helix followed by a long loop. Monomer-monomer contacts involve antiparallel beta-sheet interactions, which form a dimer with two layers of eight beta-strands. One peptide per monomer occupies the principal hormone-binding pocket formed by part of the amino-terminal region and parts of the connecting helix and loop, with binding to protein consistent with conclusions drawn from solution studies. Dimer-dimer contacts involve the Tyr49 region adjacent to this site. A fifth dipeptide, of unknown biological significance, helps to stabilize one of the monomer-monomer interfaces and the tetramer-tetramer network in the crystal.\r"

Only the 3.0-kb transcript was detected in adult tissues, where its expression was restricted almost exclusively to the central nervous system. Comparison of murine and human brain cDNA sequences corresponding to the 3.0-kb transcript revealed high conservation of two nonoverlapping open reading frames with poor conservation of the intervening spacer region and the putative 5' and 3' untranslated sequences. By immunohistochemical analysis, the protein encoded by the downstream open reading frame (GDF-1) was detected exclusively in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves in day-14.5 mouse embryos. The upstream open reading frame encodes a protein of unknown function containing multiple putative membrane-spanning domains. These findings raise the possibility that this mRNA may give rise to two different proteins.\r"

This delivery system has been found to be very effective for both the internalization and the expression of genetic material in cells that have many transferrin receptors. Upon scrutinization of the parameters involved in this method, which we have termed transferrinfection, we note two important features of the process: the polycation in polycation-transferrin conjugates, as expected, serves to attach the transferrin moiety to the DNA and, in addition, the polycation functions to condense the DNA into a doughnut structure. Electron microscopic analysis of a range of poorly active to highly active transferrinfection samples reveals a strong correlation between DNA condensation and cellular DNA uptake. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transfection activity of the DNA complex can be increased by addition of free polycation as long as a sufficient quantity of polycation-transferrin conjugates remains in the complex to ensure its binding to the cellular receptor.\r"

The protein was detectable only when the fungus was grown on cyanamide as the sole nitrogen source. Genomic DNA from the fungus was cloned, and the gene encoding the enzyme was mapped with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the amino acid sequence within a 25,800-base-pair DNA region. The subunit of the enzyme is encoded by a 795-base-pair DNA sequence containing a 63-base-pair intron. A cDNA clone containing the intronless gene with an open reading frame encoding a sequence of 244 amino acids expressed the enzyme in active form in Escherichia coli with excellent yield.\r"

The approach provides a rapid and simple assay for the analysis of differences in closely related viral isolates and allows the establishment of phylogenetic relationships between epidemiologically distinct viruses. Our results show a broad clustering of circulating viruses according to their geographical distribution. We also have analyzed the temporal appearance of mutations associated with the acquisition of resistance to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). The results show that mutations in codon 215 of the viral reverse transcriptase can be detected readily by this method in HIV isolates and also directly in peripheral blood from HIV-infected individuals after in vitro amplification of viral sequences with the polymerase chain reaction. The specific recurrence of identical double-nucleotide substitutions in epidemiologically and geographically distant viruses suggests that the restricted amino acid substitutions at this position selected by drug exposure are a critical, rate-limiting step in the acquisition of drug resistance.\r"

Genomic fragments adjacent to one of these islands were used to isolate cDNAs from both HeLa cells and cultured cystic epithelium that encode a 155-amino acid peptide having four putative transmembrane domains. The corresponding transcript was found in all tissues tested but was most abundant in brain and kidney. Potential control response elements were identified in the genomic region 5' to the initiation codon. The deduced amino acid sequence has 93% similarity to the 16-kDa proteolipid component that is believed to be part of the proton channel of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Possible roles for a mutated proton channel in the pathogenesis of cystic disease were considered. However, sequencing of cDNAs corresponding to both alleles of an affected individual revealed no differences in the deduced amino acid sequence. Moreover, transcript size and abundance were not altered in cystic kidney.\r"

  ".W": "As a step toward using gene targeting for gene therapy, we have corrected a human beta S-globin gene to the normal beta A allele by homologous recombination in the mouse-human hybrid cell line BSM. BSM is derived from a mouse erythroleukemia cell line and carries a single human chromosome 11 with the beta S-globin allele. A beta A-globin targeting construct containing a unique oligomer and a neomycin-resistance gene was electroporated into the BSM cells, which were then placed under G418 selection. Then 126 resulting pools containing a total of approximately 29,000 G418-resistant clones were screened by PCR for the presence of a targeted recombinant: 3 positive pools were identified. A targeted clone was isolated by replating one of the positive pools into smaller pools and rescreening by PCR, followed by dilution cloning. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the isolated clone had been targeted as planned. The correction of the beta S allele to beta A was confirmed both by allele-specific PCR and by allele-specific antibodies. Expression studies comparing the uninduced and induced RNA levels in unmodified BSM cells and in the targeted clone showed no significant alteration in the ability of the targeted clone to undergo induction, despite the potentially disrupting presence of a transcriptionally active neomycin gene 5' to the human beta A-globin gene. Thus gene targeting can correct a beta S allele to beta A, and the use of a selectable helper gene need not significantly interfere with the induction of the corrected gene.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic and electrotonic transmission can be induced at mixed synapses between eighth nerve fibers and the goldfish Mauthner (M) cell in vivo, by pairing weak presynaptic tetani with postsynaptic inhibition. This LTD can be reversed by stronger tetani that produce long-term potentiation (LTP). Moreover, the depression is more likely to occur and tends to last longer when the initial synaptic efficacy is high--that is, if the synaptic strength is first potentiated. In addition, when synaptic efficacy is initially elevated, a weak tetanization that usually results in a gradually developing potentiation instead produces no change in chemical transmission and even a depression of electrotonic coupling. Thus, the modifications in synaptic transmission caused by a certain tetanizing protocol depend upon the history of synaptic efficacy. This last concept provides an experimental basis for theoretical models concerned with pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the regulation of synaptic plasticity.\r"

RNA from cerebral cortex expressed GABA responses with features characteristic of currents mediated by GABAA receptors.

The bicuculline/baclofen-insensitive GABA response was a Cl- current that was blocked by picrotoxin but showed little desensitization or outward rectification.

Similar sequence motifs have been identified in several eukaryotic transcription factors and were shown to facilitate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. By using recombinant v-Myc proteins obtained by bacterial expression of full-length or partially deleted avian v-myc alleles, the functional relevance of these sequence motifs for Myc protein oligomerization and for DNA binding was investigated. All recombinant v-Myc proteins that have retained the carboxyl-terminal domain dimerize and specifically bind to double-stranded DNA containing the palindromic core sequence CACGTG. This and a closely related DNA sequence element have been defined previously as part of the binding sites for human transcription factors USF and TFE3, which specifically bind to the adenovirus major late promoter or the muE3 motif within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer, respectively. It is shown that a 61-amino-acid peptide sequence containing only the bipartite basic motif/helix-loop-helix domain of Myc is necessary and sufficient for dimerization and sequence-specific DNA binding of v-Myc recombinant proteins.\r"

The cDNA from the other type was 1966 bp long, including a 1641-bp open reading frame of 547 amino acids, giving a mass of 59,002 Da (60-kDa protein). The deduced primary sequence for the 15-kDa protein was exactly the same as the published sequence of purified nsLTP, except for an extra N-terminal sequence of 20 amino acids, consistent with the finding that nsLTP is synthesized as a larger precursor and processed to a mature form. The sequence for the 60-kDa protein contained, at the 3' end, the full sequence of the 15-kDa protein, a larger precursor to nsLTP. The 15- and 60-kDa proteins, synthesized in vitro from the respective cDNAs, were both immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-rat liver nsLTP antibody and comigrated in SDS/PAGE with the proteins made in vitro from total liver RNA. These results shed new light on the dispute among several groups of investigators about the crossreactivity of anti-nsLTP antibody with a higher molecular mass, 60-kDa protein. In Northern blot analysis, two major RNA bands, 0.85 and 2.2 kilobases (kb) long, were detected together with two minor bands of 1.6 and 2.9 kb.

The dominant T-cell site on HBeAg is tolerogenic, whereas a proportion of T cells recognizing a second T-cell site evade tolerance induction, persist in the periphery, and can be activated in vivo by a single injection of a 12-residue T-cell self peptide. The self-reactive T cells mediate in vivo autoantibody production sufficient to neutralize detection of the autoantigen in serum. Furthermore, autoantibody production can be inhibited by nonself peptides that compete with the self peptide for binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules. This model illustrates that T cells specific for an immunogenic T-cell site on a nonsequestered autoantigen can escape tolerance induction and, more importantly, can mediate autoreactivity in vivo. Furthermore, these results suggest that synthetic T-cell sites may be useful as immunotherapeutic agents for the purpose of circumventing nonresponse to HBeAg during persistent hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

J., Miletic, V., Rabson, L. D., Smith, J. A. & Fearon, D. T. (1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 1699-1717 (abstr.)] localized a C4b binding domain to SCR-1 and/or SCR-2 and a C3b binding domain to SCR-8 and/or SCR-9. These SCRs bind different ligands, although SCR-1 and SCR-8 are 55% homologous and SCR-2 and SCR-9 are 70% homologous. To examine if one or two SCRs are required for ligand binding and to define sites within the SCRs that determine specificity of binding, mutagenesis analysis of a truncated, secreted form of CR1, called CR1-4 by Hourcade et al. [Hourcade, D., Meisner, D. R., Atkinson, J. P. & Holers, V. M. (1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 1255-1270], was undertaken. The latter, composed of the first eight and one-half amino-terminal SCRs of CR1, efficiently bound C4b but not iC3. SCR-1 and SCR-2 were necessary for this interaction. Analysis of the mutant CR1-4 proteins, in which amino acids in SCR-1 and SCR-2 were substituted a few at a time with the homologous amino acids of SCR-8 and SCR-9, led to the identification of one amino acid in SCR-1 and three amino acids in SCR-2 important for C4b binding. Furthermore, five amino acids at the end of SCR-9, if placed in the homologous positions of SCR-2, conferred iC3 binding and are likely essential for ligand binding activity of SCR-8 and SCR-9. This iC3 binding occurred only if SCR-1 was present, indicating that two contiguous SCRs are necessary for this interaction. These results provide identification of amino acids within SCRs that are important for ligand binding.\r"

Gross pathologic examination of MAV-1-infected mice revealed only pale yellow liver tissue. Histopathologic studies of tissue from MAV-1-infected mice revealed diffuse hepatic injury manifested by microvesicular fatty degenerative changes of hepatocytes and electron microscopic evidence of focal mitochondrial swelling with disruption of cristae and depletion of glycogen. Serum aminotransferase activities increased markedly in the infected animals; however, plasma ammonia levels were not elevated at the times assayed. Although all mice infected with MAV-1 died, neutralizing anti-MAV-1 monoclonal antibodies provided a dose-dependent delay in the appearance of clinical disease and hepatic histopathologic findings. Other findings included rare viral inclusions with only minimal inflammation in spleen, adrenal, and liver of infected mice. Our findings indicate that MAV-1 infection of SCID mice may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of the hepatic lesions of Reye syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene. This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains.\r"

A possible explanation for this result may be the reduced expression of manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in HIV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) further sensitizes HIV-infected cells but not uninfected cells to heat and radiation. This is consistent with the ability of TNF-alpha to induce the expression of MnSOD in uninfected but not in HIV-infected cells. HIV-infected HUT-78 cell lines engineered to overexpress MnSOD are more resistant to heat and radiation than HIV-infected cells that do not overexpress MnSOD. However, treatment with TNF-alpha still sensitizes these cells to heat and radiation.\r"

  ".W": "The structure of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), inferred from its DNA sequence, includes two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-homologous domains in its amino-terminal region. This suggests that factor XII may exhibit EGF-like activities. Reciprocal antigenic cross-reactivity between factor XII and EGF was shown by exposing purified human factor XII or mouse EGF to anti-mouse EGF or anti-human factor XII. Western blot analysis showed that anti-mouse EGF recognized intact factor XII at 80 kDa. Together, these results suggest that the EGF-homologous domains are accessible for anti-EGF binding in native factor XII. To determine whether factor XII has mitogenic activity, HepG2 or L cells (10(4) cells per well) were grown in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of factor XII or kaolin-activated factor XII (factor XIIa). Both factors XII and XIIa (6.0 micrograms/ml) enhanced cell proliferation by approximately 2-fold (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). In contrast, L cells, which are not EGF target cells, were not affected by either factor XII or factor XIIa. Various doses of factor XII enhanced cell proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and [3H]leucine incorporation in HepG2 cells cultured under the same conditions. These data indicate that factor XII, like EGF, is a mitogen for HepG2 cells and suggest a possible autocrine role in the liver.\r"

The Shal deduced proteins are more highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila than other presently known K+ channels. mShal carries a \"low-threshold\" A-type current with a hyperpolarized steady-state inactivation midpoint. Marked similarity was observed between mShal and its Drosophila homolog, fShal, with regard to voltage sensitivity of activation, macroscopic inactivation, steady-state inactivation, and 4-aminopyridine sensitivity. Sequence conservation for Shal proteins is unusually high at the amino terminus, an area considered important for inactivation. Removal of conserved amino-terminal residues from mShal modifies macroscopic inactivation but the transient nature of the current is preserved. Underlying the very high conservation of mShal and fShal may be a role in the nervous system that is conserved in widely divergent species.\r"

To determine whether plasma membrane ion channels from these organelles could be physiologically activated, we extruded axoplasm from squid giant axons, dissociated organelles from the cytoskeletal matrix, and fused the free organelles with planar lipid bilayers. Three classes of ion channels normally associated with the plasma membrane were identified based on conductance, selectivity, and gating properties determined from steady-state single-channel recordings: (i) voltage-dependent Na channels, (ii) voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K channels, and (iii) large, voltage-independent K channels. The identity of the delayed rectifier channels was confirmed by reconstructing the time course of activation from single-channel responses to depolarizing voltage steps applied across the bilayer. These observations suggest that several classes of plasma membrane ion channels are transported in cytoplasmic organelles in physiologically active forms.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations in various motor and sensory cortical areas have shown that fast oscillations (20-80 Hz) of focal electroencephalogram and multiunit activities occur spontaneously during increased alertness or are dependent upon optimal sensory stimuli. We now report the presence of 20- to 40-Hz rhythmic activities in intracellularly recorded thalamocortical cells of the cat. In some neurons, subthreshold oscillations were triggered by depolarizing pulses and eventually gave rise to action potentials. In other neurons, the oscillations consisted of fast prepotentials, occasionally generating full spikes that arose from the resting or even from hyperpolarized membrane potential levels, and leading to trains of spikes at more depolarized levels. The rhythmic nature of these fast prepotentials was confirmed by means of an autocorrelation study, which demonstrated clear peaks at 25-ms intervals (40 Hz). In view of the recent evidence that mesopontine cholinergic nuclei trigger and maintain activation processes in thalamocortical systems, we tested the possibility that stimulation of these brainstem nuclei potentiates the 40-Hz waves on the background of the cortical electroencephalogram. This was indeed the case. The potentiation outlasted the stimulation by 10-20 s. The brainstem-induced facilitation of cortical 40-Hz oscillations was blocked by scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist. That this facilitation was transmitted by brainstem-thalamic cholinergic projections was confirmed by persistence of the phenomenon after large excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert.\r"

The chimeric receptors were expressed in mammalian cells and partially purified. Binding studies revealed that a construct comprising an IGF-I receptor in which the 68 N-terminal amino acids of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit had replaced the equivalent IGF-I receptor segment displayed a markedly increased affinity for insulin. In contrast, the corresponding IGF-I receptor sequence is not critical for high-affinity IGF-I binding. It is shown that part of the cysteine-rich domain determines IGF-I specificity. We have previously shown that exchanging exons 1, 2, and 3 of the insulin receptor with the corresponding IGF-I receptor sequence results in loss of high affinity for insulin and gain of high affinity for IGF-I. Consequently, it is suggested that the ligand specificities of the two receptors (i.e., the sequences that discriminate between insulin and IGF-I) reside in different regions of a binding site with common features present in both receptors.\r"

The inserted CD4 displayed the same epitopes as the naturally occurring CD4 in human T4 cells. Double-labeling experiments (125I-CD4 and 51Cr-RBC) showed that the half-life of CD4 electroinserted in RBC membrane in rabbits was approximately 7 days. Using the fluorescence dequenching technique with octadecylrhodamine B-labeled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, we showed fusion of the HIV envelope with the plasma membrane of RBC-CD4, whereas no such fusion could be detected with RBC. The dequenching efficiency of RBC-CD4 is the same as that of CEM cells. Exposure to anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4A, which binds to the CD4 region that attaches to envelope glycoprotein gp120, caused a significant decrease in the dequenching of fluorescence. In vitro infectivity studies showed that preincubation of HIV-1 with RBC-CD4 reduced by 80-90% the appearance of HIV antigens in target cells, the amount of viral reverse transcriptase, and the amount of p24 core antigen produced by the target cells. RBC-CD4, but not RBCs, aggregated with chronically HIV-1-infected T cells and caused formation of giant cells. These data show that the RBC-CD4 reagent is relatively long lived in circulation and efficient in attaching to HIV-1 and HIV-infected cells, and thus it may have value as a therapeutic agent against AIDS.\r"

IL-6-treated cells lose their epithelial character, become stellate or fusiform in shape, and migrate away from neighbors. In the wild-type ZR-75-1 cells, IL-6 causes cell-cell separation in preformed colonies as well as postmitotically. We have now investigated the action of IL-6 in clone B ZR-75-1 cells, which are morphologically distinct from wild-type ZR-75-1 cells. In the more polygonal rather than cuboidal clone B cells, IL-6 did not cause early inhibition of DNA synthesis and it caused little cell-cell separation in preformed colonies. However, IL-6 treatment markedly prolonged the interval between mitosis and readherence of daughter cells to their neighbors and the substratum. Supernatants from IL-6-treated cultures contained detached viable cells in increased numbers. Intermitotic intervals were prolonged in IL-6-treated cultures. IL-6-treated dividing breast carcinoma cells are characterized by an increased probability of separation from neighbors and the substratum.\r"

The major antigenic region of cytochrome c is located on the surface opposite of that containing the exposed heme crevice. mAbs specific for this region on rat cytochrome c were affected in binding by amino acid substitutions at positions 62 and at one or more of positions 3, 100, 103, and 104 but not by a substitution at position 89. In contrast, mAbs specific for the same region on horse cytochrome c were affected by amino acid substitutions at positions 62, (probably) 60, and 89. Some, but not all, of the anti-horse cytochrome c mAbs were affected by amino acid substitutions at one or more of positions 3, 100, 103, and 104. Thus, the functional boundaries of this antigenic region are different for these two cytochromes c, as shown primarily by the differential effects of residue 89. This distinction is most likely due to one or more of the four amino acid differences between horse and rat cytochromes c on the antigenic surface that result in different physicochemical properties for the horse and rat proteins. The results suggest that as yet unidentified physicochemical parameters, possibly surface topography and/or charge distribution, influence the focusing of antibodies onto the surface of a protein antigen.\r"

In vitro, Renilla luciferase emits blue light in the absence of any green fluorescent protein. A Renilla cDNA library has been constructed in lambda gt11 and screened by plaque hybridization with two oligonucleotide probes. We report here the isolation and characterization of a luciferase cDNA and its gene product.

The sequence predicts a protein of molecular weight 25,599 whose 24 amino-terminal residues are identical to those of the class-mu isoenzyme expressed from the GST4 locus. The GTHMUS cDNA shares 93.7% nucleotide sequence identity with a human liver cDNA clone, GTH411, that is encoded at the GST1 locus. Comparison of the liver and muscle cDNA sequences shows two regions of remarkable sequence conservation: a 140-nucleotide region in the 5' coding portion of the molecule that has a single silent nucleotide substitution, and a 550-nucleotide region, including the entire 3' noncoding region, that has only three nucleotide substitutions or deletions. This sequence conservation suggests that gene conversion has occurred between the human GST1 and GST4 glutathione transferase gene loci. The human muscle and liver glutathione transferase clones GTHMUS and GTH411 have been expressed in Escherichia coli. The kinetic mechanism of the muscle enzyme was examined in product inhibition studies. The inhibition patterns are best modeled by a steady-state ordered bi-bi reaction mechanism. Glutathione is the first substrate bound and chloride ion is the first product released. Chloride ion inhibits the muscle enzyme.\r"

Protein farnesyltransferases have been identified, but no such enzyme has been identified for geranylgeranylation. We report the identification of an activity in crude soluble yeast extracts that catalyzes the transfer of a geranylgeranyl moiety from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to proteins having the C-terminal sequence Cys-Ile-Ile-Leu or Cys-Val-Leu-Leu but not to a similar protein ending with Cys-Ile-Ile-Ser. This activity is dependent upon the CDC43/CAL1 gene, which is involved in budding and the control of cell polarity, but does not require the DPR1/RAM1 gene, which is known to be required for the farnesylation of Ras proteins. These results indicate that the protein geranylgeranyltransferase activity is distinct from the protein farnesyltransferase activity and that its specificity depends in part on the extreme C-terminal leucine in the protein to be prenylated.\r"

We have utilized immunological and biochemical techniques to determine if GSBP and PDI are identical in yeast. Antiserum prepared against yeast GSBP identified in microsomes by its ability to be labeled with a peptide photoaffinity probe was found to recognize PDI purified from yeast. Moreover, this purified yeast PDI was found to be specifically labeled by the photoaffinity probe originally used to identify GSBP in a variety of eukaryotes. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that yeast GSBP and PDI are the same protein. The structure of the yeast PDI gene revealed a product with sequence similarity to higher eukaryotic PDI/GSBP. Disruption of this gene in yeast resulted in a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that PDI/GSBP is required for cell viability.\r"

Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of cDNAs encoding a bovine desmocollin. The open reading frame found in the longest cDNA, 5 kilobases, contains a region encoding a protein of 839 amino acids. The features of the deduced amino acid sequence imply that the mature 707-amino acid desmocollin is a type I transmembrane protein that is produced by proteolytic cleavage of an 810-amino acid precursor. The ectodomain of desmocollin contains repeats that show extensive sequence similarity to members of the cadherin family of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of desmocollin, desmoglein, and the cadherins shows that although these intercellular junctional adhesion molecules share a consensus sequence in their adhesive domains that defines them as a family, several features, including the divergence in the sequence of their cytoplasmic tails, divide them into three distinct subtypes.\r"

Nevertheless, little is known about the host-parasite interactions that lead to this pathology. We have previously cloned several members of a large gene family (SA85-1) and shown that these genes encode 85-kDa T. cruzi, mammalian-stage-specific, surface antigens. Here we report that members of the SA85-1 family possess sialidase activity and are shed by the parasite. We suggest that the sialidases may contribute to the pathology during T. cruzi infection by cleaving sialic acid from cells of the immune system.\r"

  ".W": "The rodent primary somatosensory cortex is characterized by aggregates of cellular and axonal elements that replicate the distribution of mystacial vibrissae on the face. The periphery-related cortical pattern (\"barrels\") is influenced by an amalgam of elements extrinsic (i.e., afferents) and intrinsic (i.e., neurons, glia, and their substrate) to the developing neocortex. To assign the role of some of these elements in cortical pattern formation, we have examined the temporal correlation between periphery-related patterns formed by thalamocortical axons and by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules associated with neurons and glia in the cortex. Thalamocortical axons were labeled with the lipophilic tracer 1,1'-dioctydecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) in aldehyde-fixed neonatal rat brains, and the same brains were also prepared for immunohistochemical localization of ECM molecules cytotactin and cytotactin-binding proteoglycan. We present evidence that thalamocortical axons form a periphery-related pattern well before such an organization is detectable in the distribution of ECM molecules. Furthermore, a patterned distribution of ECM molecules results from the down-regulation of these molecules from barrel centers, where thalamic axons have established vibrissa-specific patches. We conclude that thalamic axons convey the blueprint of the sensory periphery onto the neocortex and that ECM molecules do not participate in the initial formation of this pattern.\r"

By systematically replacing side chains with alanine we probed the importance of charged residues (49 total, typically located on the surface), aromatic residues (9 total), and neighbors of these (26 total). The alanine substitutions that were most disruptive to hormone binding are located predominantly in four segments of a cysteine-rich domain in the hGHbp, and collectively they form a patch when mapped upon a structural model proposed for cytokine receptors. Control experiments with monoclonal antibodies confirmed that most of these alanine substitutions do not disrupt the overall antigenic structure of the hGHbp. This high-resolution functional analysis will complement structural studies and provides a powerful basis for evaluating and engineering the energetics of hormone-receptor interactions. Moreover, the hormone-binding determinants identified here may be similarly located in other, homologous, receptors.\r"

These cells are derived from proliferating neuroectodermal precursors that differentiate after terminal mitosis and become organized in cell strata. Genes that are specifically expressed at the various stages of retinal development are presently unknown. We have isolated a quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) cDNA clone, named QR1, encoding a 676-amino acid protein whose carboxyl-terminal portion shows significant similarity to those of the extracellular glycoprotein osteonectin/SPARC/BM40 and of the recently described SC1 protein. The QR1 cDNA identifies a mRNA detected in NR but not in other embryonic tissues examined. The levels of this mRNA are markedly reduced when nondividing NR cells are induced to proliferate by the v-src oncogene. QR1 expression in NR is limited to the middle portion of the inner nuclear layer, a localization that essentially corresponds to that of Muller cells. Transcription of QR1 takes place only during the late phase of retinal development and is shut off sharply at hatching. Signals that regulate this unique pattern of expression appear to originate within the NR, since the QR1 mRNA is transcribed in cultured NR cells and is shut off also in vitro at a time coinciding with hatching.\r"

  ".U": "91239597\r", 
  ".W": "Galanin (GAL) is widely distributed in the peripheral and the central nervous systems. In the brain, the highest GAL concentrations are observed within the hypothalamus and, particularly, in nerve terminals of the median eminence. This location, as well as GAL actions on prolactin, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion, suggest the possibility that GAL may act as a putative hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormone. To establish this, GAL and LHRH levels were measured in hypophyseal portal plasma samples using specific radioimmunoassays. Rat galanin (rGAL) concentrations in portal blood were approximately 7-fold higher than those observed in peripheral plasma in male and female (estrus, diestrus) rats, indicating an active secretory process of rGAL into the portal vasculature. Frequent (10 min) sampling revealed that rGAL and LHRH were secreted into the portal circulation in a pulsatile manner with a pulse frequency of one pulse per hour. Interestingly, both hormone series depicted a high degree of coincident episodes. In fact, the probability of random coincidence, calculated by the algorithm HYPERGEO, was less than 0.01. Moreover, the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold, when given systemically, was taken up by GAL neurons in the hypothalamus, including a subset of neurons expressing rGAL and LHRH, strengthening the notion of the existence of a GAL neuronal system connected to the hypophyseal portal circulation. These observations reinforce the concept that GAL regulates pituitary hormone secretion. To analyze this in further detail, the effects of rGAL on LH secretion were evaluated under basal and stimulated conditions. rGAL induced a small but dose-dependent increase in LH secretion from cultured, dispersed pituitary cells. Interestingly, rGAL enhanced the ability of LHRH to stimulate LH release. The tight link between GAL and LHRH neuronal systems is strengthened by the observation that during the estrous cycle of the rat, rGAL and LHRH contents in the median eminence show an identical profile (r = 1.00). These data indicate that GAL should be considered as a hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormone and as an important neuromodulator of LHRH secretion and action. The colocalization and cosecretion of GAL and LHRH and the cooperative action at the level of the anterior pituitary afford important evidence for the functional significance of coexistence of neurotransmitters in neurons of the central nervous system.\r"

Nuclear extracts from the S. frugiperda cells primed with plasmid DNA containing the adenovirus major late promoter produced run-off transcripts of the size predicted for initiation from the adenovirus promoter. In addition, nuclear extracts prepared from a human cell line accurately initiated transcription from the promoter of the baculovirus immediate early gene encoding gp64.

Members of this insect neuropeptide family share the common C-terminal pentapeptide sequence Phe-Xaa-Pro-Arg-Leu-NH2 (Xaa = Ser, Thr, or Val). Circular dichroic, nuclear magnetic resonance, and molecular dynamics analyses of the conformationally restricted cyclic pyrokinin analog cyclo(-Asn-Thr-Ser-Phe-Thr-Pro-Arg-Leu-) indicated the presence of a beta-turn in the active core region encompassing residues Thr-Pro-Arg-Leu. The rigid cyclic analog retains biological activity, suggesting that its C-terminal beta-turn is the active pyrokinin conformation recognized by the myotropic receptor. As individual pyrokinins and pyrokinin-like neuropeptides demonstrate both oviduct-contractile and pheromone-biosynthesis activities in various insects, the biologically active beta-turn structure reported here holds broad significance for many biological processes.\r"

Processing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag precursor Pr55 was analyzed through a combination of pulse-chase labeling, cell fractionation, and immunoprecipitation. We observed a membrane-associated processing pathway for the Gag precursor that gives rise to virions. In addition, we found that a significant amount of processing occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells resulting in the intracellular accumulation of appropriately processed viral proteins. This observation suggests the viral protease is active in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. Processing of the Gag protein was blocked in both compartments by the addition of a viral protease inhibitor. A comparison of the amount of cytoplasmic processing seen in lytically infected cells with that seen in chronically infected cells showed that cytoplasmic processing was associated with the lytic infection. These observations raise the possibility that activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease in the cytoplasm of lytically infected cells might result in the cleavage of cellular proteins and thus contribute to cytotoxicity.\r"

The ability to discriminate among honeybee subspecies was established by testing a total of 129 colonies from Africa and Europe. Matriline identities could thus be determined for imported New World bees. Among 41 managed and feral colonies in the United States and north Mexico, two European lineages (west and east) were distinguished. From neotropical regions, 72 feral colonies had African mtDNA and 4 had European mtDNA. The results support earlier conclusions that neotropical African bees have spread as unbroken African maternal lineages. Old and New World African honeybee populations exhibit different frequencies of a mtDNA length polymorphism. Through standard analyses, a north African mtDNA type that may have been imported previously from Spain or Portugal was not detected among neotropical African bees.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertrehalosemic hormone (a carbohydrate-mobilizing neuroendocrine decapeptide) and starvation markedly increased levels of a cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis) fat body cytochrome P450 message. The gene represented by the cloned P450 cDNA has been named CYP4C1 (cytochrome P450 family 4, subfamily C, gene 1), a newly identified member of the ubiquitous cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene superfamily. Blaberus CYP4C1 (511 amino acids, Mr = 58,485) has a hydrophobic NH2 terminus and a sequence near the COOH terminus that is homologous to the cysteine-containing heme-binding region definitive of cytochromes P450. The cockroach sequence is 32-36% identical to mammalian family 4A and 4B enzymes. It contains a 13-residue sequence characteristic of family 4 but not other P450s. This study suggests that CYP4C1 is hormonally regulated in association with energy substrate mobilization and supports the idea that family 4 is an old and widespread gene family.\r"

Seventeen patients having pressure ulcers in the pelvic region were randomly assigned to either an HVPC group or a placebo HVPC group. Treatments were given for 1 hour a day for 20 consecutive days. The HVPC protocol consisted of an aluminum-foil electrode placed over the ulcer and set at negative polarity in reference to the dispersive electrode placed on the thigh. Stimulator frequency was set at 100 pps, and an intensity of 200 V was used. Measurements of ulcer surface area were conducted before treatment and after treatment days 5, 10, 15, and 20. To measure ulcer area (in square millimeters), slides taken at each measurement time were projected at actual size, traced, and digitized. Percentage of change compared with pretreatment ulcer size was calculated for each measurement time. Ulcers in the HVPC group demonstrated significantly greater percentage-of-change decreases from their pretreatment size than did ulcers in the placebo group at days 5, 15, and 20. The results suggest that HVPC, in conjunction with good nursing care, can significantly increase the healing rate of pelvic ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury.\r"

Twenty freshman sweep rowers were subjects for this study. Range-of-motion (ROM) measurements were taken for forward bending (FB), backward bending (BB) (double inclinometers), lateral bending (LB) (tape measure), and rotation (double-arm goniometer). Intratester reliability for ROM was also assessed. The Back Analysis System was used to determine static trunk extensor strength (ie, maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) and to compute EMG spectral parameters from a paraspinal multi-electrode array. A two-group stepwise discriminant-analysis procedure for the ROM and MVC variables correctly identified 57% of the rowers with LBP and 63% of the rowers without LBP. A similar discriminant-analysis procedure for EMG spectral parameters correctly identified either 88% of the rowers with LBP and 100% of the rowers without LBP or 100% of the rowers with LBP and 88% of the rowers with LBP, depending on whether EMG measurements of recovery were calculated at 1 minute or at 2 minutes into the recovery period. Sensitivity (66%) and specificity (71%) results from the more traditional tests suggest that these techniques may be of limited usefulness for LBP screening or diagnosis.\r"

In a comparison of these two modalities, 30 patients with ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to either a group receiving electrical stimulation in conjunction with voluntary isometric exercise or a group receiving biofeedback in conjunction with voluntary isometric exercise. Following 6 weeks of a rehabilitative exercise protocol, the quadriceps femoris muscle isometric peak torque in the operative limb was compared with that in the nonoperative limb. A t test of independent samples indicated that the biofeedback group recovered a significantly greater percentage of their nonoperative limb's peak torque than did the electrical stimulation group. Measurements of active knee extension were taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 of the exercise program. A two-way analysis of variance (groups x weeks) indicated no significant difference between the rate at which each group recovered full active extension. The authors concluded that biofeedback is more effective than electrical stimulation in facilitating the recovery of peak torque and that biofeedback is comparable to electrical stimulation in the recovery of active knee extension.\r"

Fifty-four licensed physical therapists with varying amounts of clinical experience served as raters. Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis who demonstrated an abnormal gait pattern served as subjects for the videotape. The raters analyzed each patient's most severely involved knee during the four subphases of stance for the kinematic variables of knee flexion and genu valgum. Raters were asked to determine whether these variables were inadequate, normal, or excessive. The temporospatial variables analyzed throughout the entire gait cycle were cadence, step length, stride length, stance time, and step width. Generalized kappa coefficients ranged from .11 to .52. Intraclass correlation coefficients (2,1) and (3,1) were slightly higher. Our results indicate that physical therapists' VOGA assessments are only slightly to moderately reliable and that improved interrater reliability of the assessments of physical therapists utilizing this technique is needed. Our data suggest that there is a need for greater standardization of gait-analysis training.\r"

The subjects in this study rose from a chair under a controlled protocol. An optoelectronic system, two force plates, and two computers were used for data collection and processing. The data are described in relationship to three phases of the task previously described for the young subjects' data. Percentages of difference were calculated for the torques and the velocities. Independent t tests were conducted on maximum angles achieved and total joint excursions. Consistency between groups was demonstrated in the duration of each phase, as well as the body kinematics and kinetics occurring within each phase. There was little difference in maximum torques or velocities. Maximum angles of head-to-trunk extension, head-to-ground flexion, head-to-trunk excursion, and trunk-to-pelvis flexion were significantly different between groups. The differences in head position demonstrated between these two groups may have clinical implications for loss of balance during this task in older patients.\r"

The sample consisted of 450 randomly selected private practice decision makers (eg, owners, chief executive officers) from throughout the United States. Data were gathered using a mailed, structured questionnaire. Physical therapy private practices were found to differentially attend to environmental sectors with the customer sector ranked the highest followed, in descending order, by the technological, regulatory, socio-cultural-political, competitive, and economic sectors. In addition, firms in the high-level entrepreneurship group scanned the technological and marketing (customer, competitive) environments to a significantly greater degree than did the middle- and low-level groups. Direct-access status had no effect on scanning behavior.\r"

New Zealand white rabbits were used for this study. A sham-treated group (n = 16) underwent implantation of dental amalgam markers to either side of the frontonasal, coronal, and lambdoid sutures at 9 days of age to serve as markers of vault growth. The experimental group (n = 7) underwent the same marker placement at 9 days of age, but, in addition, at 30 days of age these animals underwent placement of a mechanical spring, unilaterally, at the frontosphenoid suture. A second control group (n = 8) underwent the same exposure of the frontosphenoid suture, but the spring was laid only on the surface of the bone. All animals were followed by radiographic cephalometry at 9, 30, 60, and 90 days of age. The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant expansion of the cranial base and ipsilateral coronal suture. The midface skeletal dimensions were unchanged by spring distraction of the cranial base. These findings indicate that cranial base sutural growth can be manipulated mechanically and that growth changes can be attained secondarily in the cranial vault skeleton.\r"

In these methods, the raised true columella worsens the dorsal dislocation of the lateral crura of the alar cartilages and the lateral and dorsal displacement of the alar domes. We believe that lengthening the upper columella from above is more anatomic and reasonable than lengthening the lower columella. A method for reconstructing the upper columella by medial and ventral rotation of the dislocated alar domes is described. Figi's \"flying bird\" incision was extended to the columellar base along the nostril margin. Through this incision, the lower one-third of the nose, including the alae and nostril floors, was undermined widely. The inner layers, the nostrils, were freed from the surrounding tissues, except in the region of the columella and the septum, and rotated medially in the opposite direction of Cronin's technique. The resulting nasal shape, involving the columellar length and the concavity between the nasal tip and lateral ala, improved in 11 patients.\r"

Nasal-alveolar fistulas and/or anterior palatal fistulas that were intentionally not repaired were excluded from study. Cleft palate fistulas (CPFs) occurred in 30 of 129 patients (23 percent), although nearly a half were 1 to 2 mm in size. Extent of clefting, as estimated by the Veau classification, was significantly more severe in those patients who developed cleft palate fistula. Type of palate closure also influenced the frequency of cleft palate fistula. Forty-three percent of patients undergoing Wardill-type closures developed cleft palate fistula versus 10, 22, and 0 percent for Furlow, von Langenbeck, and Dorrance style closures, respectively. The fistula rate was similar in patients with (30 percent) and without (25 percent) intravelar veloplasty. Age at palate closure did not significantly affect the rate of fistulization; however, the surgeon performing the initial closure did not have an effect. Thirty-seven percent of patients developed recurrent cleft palate fistulas following initial fistula repair. Recurrence of cleft palate fistulas was not influenced by severity of cleft or type of original palate repair. Following end-stage management, a second cleft palate fistula recurrence occurred in 25 percent of patients. Continued open discussion of results of cleft palate repair is recommended.\r"

In 27 mastectomies, the senior author has had direct input in the preoperative skin planning. All patients underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In large-breasted women, the mastectomy was performed to a Wise-type pattern. In small-breasted women, the mastectomy involved minimal skin excision followed by reconstruction. Non-continuous incisions were frequently used in small-breasted women, thereby minimizing breast scarring. When appropriately applied, skin-sparing mastectomy can greatly improve the final aesthetic result of the breast.\r"

Patients had less back pain after (10 patients) than before (18 patients) the operation and found their sit-up and sport possibilities about the same as before. Detailed assessment of the abdominal muscles by the physiotherapist showed, however, a decreased function, more evident in bilateral cases. CT scans demonstrated a medialization of the lateral muscles, leaving only a small medial portion of the abdominal wall devoid of muscles. On the whole, no problem of clinical significance was encountered, and patients showed a high degree of satisfaction with the operation.\r"

The capsules removed were prepared and measured using a new method. The capsules were (1) removed and stored in physiologic solution until the time of measurement (30 minutes to 2 hours) and (2) measured using a Mitutoyo dial-thickness gauge (MDTG) that employs a uniform pressure of 85 gm. The measurements revealed that soft breasts (Baker 1) have the thinnest scar-tissue capsules, which ranged in thickness from 0.002 to 0.010 inches. Firm breasts yielded the thickest capsules. Baker 3 measured between 0.010 and 0.078 inches thick, and Baker 4 measured between 0.018 and 0.162 inches thick. We also compared the precision of measurement between the MDTG and a standard (screw-type) micrometer by taking a series of readings on a soft, pliable substance (textured silicone rubber).\r"

During a 70-month period, 199 free flaps were performed in 151 patients at the Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 60 of these involving 47 patients over the age of 60. Primary coverage rates differed significantly between the elderly and younger age groups (68.5 versus 85.3 percent, respectively); however, eventual coverage rates (92.6 versus 96.3 percent), minor complication rates (34.0 versus 34.6 percent), mortality rates (2.1 versus 1.0 percent), flap revision rates (32 percent of patients versus 30 percent), and length of postoperative hospitalization (18.7 versus 18.8 days) were not significantly different in the two groups. Among the elderly, significant increases in flap loss rates were noted with the use of end-to-side arterial anastomosis, placement of the anastomosis within a zone of injury, and the use of the gracilis muscle donor site. Our data suggest that the primary cause of free-flap failure is construction of the anastomosis within a zone of injury. Free-tissue transfer is a valuable option in the repair of tissue defects in the elderly and should not be denied as a treatment because of patient age.\r"

  ".W": "The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was selected to further characterize the human antibody response to Zyderm (ZCI). Our studies have involved both patients and volunteers. Five patients with delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to Zyderm were positive for anti-Zyderm antibody. Six of nine patients treated with Zyderm who never displayed cutaneous reactions did develop significant levels of anti-Zyderm serum antibody. Some of these patients progressively increased their antibody levels. None of the volunteers who received multiple skin-test doses (0.1 cc) of Zyderm developed significant levels of anti-Zyderm antibody. Polyvalent anti-Zyderm antibody titers among patients with positive ELISA absorbance ranged from 1:16 to greater than 1:128. All were positive for antibodies of the IgG subtype; half were positive for the IgA subtype. None was positive for IgM or IgE subtype. We did not observe cross-reactivity between patient anti-bovine collagen sera and commercially prepared antibodies to human anti-collagen types I, II, and III. Given the frequency of current Zyderm use, it seems evident that for most patients, biologic exposure to collagen does not pose a health hazard. Nevertheless, because of the scarcity of data pertaining to the long-term significance of humoral anti-Zyderm antibodies, physicians and patients should be aware that unanswered questions remain whenever clinical use of injectable collagen is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linked, allogeneic, telopeptide-depleted dermal grafts were lyophilized and laminated with silicone rubber elastomer. Resultant bilayers were studied for incorporation into the wound site and capacity to inhibit cutaneous wound contraction in experimental animals. Bilateral full-thickness skin wounds were made in 20 male New Zealand white rabbits. One side was grafted with the processed graft, while the contralateral side remained ungrafted as a control wound. Over 63 days, wound sites were analyzed at intervals on the basis of the extent and rate of wound contraction and by histologic examination. Cutaneous wounds successfully incorporated graft matrix and were significantly inhibited in their rate and extent of wound contraction. Notably, by day 63, grafted wounds retained 71 percent of their original area, whereas ungrafted control wounds retained only 16 percent of their original area. There were no graft rejections, and the bilayer graft's dermal analogue appeared to function as a biodegradable template that physically conformed neodermis to a preestablished pattern while counteracting contractile forces. This investigation suggests that, in experimental animals, the success of bilayer dermal grafts is less dependent on highly specialized and complex preparative techniques than typically has been presumed and that relatively simple, previously published, nonproprietary techniques, when adapted to a bilayer format, yield acceptable results as defined in terms of biocompatibility, capacity for graft incorporation, and inhibition of wound contraction.\r"

We report the results of 17 thumbs that had an avulsion amputation and were replanted. Fourteen of the 17 survived (82 percent). Our experience indicated that the survival rate was improved by restoring continuity of at least two veins and two arteries, using a Y-shaped vein graft and the princeps pollicis artery for the source of arterial circulation. Nerve grafts were used to bridge defects in avulsed digital nerves. When possible, avulsed tendons were reattached to their muscle. Key pinch strength was 60 percent of normal, and grip strength was always less than that of the normal hand. The age of the patients and the cold ischemia time had no significant effect on either survival or function of the replanted thumb. When excellent venous backflow occurred immediately after the vessel repair and continued for at least 20 minutes, the thumb always survived without complications.\r"

  ".W": "Full-thickness cranial (membranous) and split-thickness iliac crest (endochondral) onlay bone grafts were placed subperiosteally without fixation onto the snout (membranous) and tibia (endochondral) in 30 rats. The animals had been divided into three equal groups in which the bone grafts had been demineralized, autoclaved, or used fresh. Recipient sites were harvested at 7 and 14 days at the snout and 14 days at the tibia, and revascularization was studied utilizing silicone rubber injection and a gridcounting technique. Endochondral grafts were found to have quantitatively greater revascularization than membranous grafts in all three groups at both sites (p less than 0.005). There was generally no statistically significant difference in revascularization between fresh and demineralized grafts, but vessel ingrowth was significantly decreased in autoclaved implants as compared with fresh grafts. Differences in graft architecture are theorized to account for the disparity in revascularization in endochondral and membranous grafts. Angiogenic and chemotactic factors are thought to play a role in the similarities and differences in revascularization among fresh, demineralized, and autoclaved bone.\r"

Ultrasonography is presented as a reliable, sensitive method of evaluation of implant integrity. It should be considered the definitive study of prosthesis integrity. When sonography is added to mammographic and clinical examination, the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic augmented breasts is complete. Ultrasonography may be considered with mammography in the routine breast examination of all previously augmented patients.\r"
