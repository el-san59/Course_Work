  ".W": "Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is the immediate product of the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis, hydroxylation of tyrosine. This study examined whether plasma concentrations of DOPA are related to tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Plasma concentrations of DOPA, norepinephrine, and the norepinephrine metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were measured in arterial blood and blood draining the heart, brain, and forearm of 21 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Rates of entry of norepinephrine into arterial plasma and plasma draining the heart were estimated using infusions of radioactive norepinephrine. Arterial plasma DOPA correlated positively with arterial plasma DHPG (r = 0.63), MHPG (r = 0.47), norepinephrine (r = 0.67), and the rate of entry of norepinephrine into arterial plasma (r = 0.62). There were significant arteriovenous increments in plasma DOPA: 28% across the heart, 18% across the brain, and 32% across the forearm. Arteriovenous increments in plasma DOPA across the brain correlated positively with increments in plasma DHPG (r = 0.83), but not with increments in norepinephrine or MHPG. In the arm, where MHPG was the major metabolite, arteriovenous increments in DOPA correlated positively with increments in MHPG (r = 0.52) and with the combined increments in MHPG, DHPG, and norepinephrine (r = 0.60). In the heart, where DHPG was the major metabolite, arteriovenous increments in DOPA correlated positively with increments in DHPG (r = 0.72) and the combined increments in DHPG, MHPG, and norepinephrine (r = 0.62). The rate at which norepinephrine entered the great cardiac venous plasma from tissues of the heart correlated positively with the rate at which DOPA overflowed from the heart into the systemic circulation (r = 0.56). The relationships between plasma DOPA and norepinephrine metabolism and the rates of norepinephrine entry into plasma support the view that plasma DOPA reflects tyrosine hydroxylase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D-dependent rickets, type II, is a hereditary disease that results from target organ resistance to the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. We describe here a family (designated G) with a defect in the DNA-binding domain of the 1,25-(OH)2D receptor (VDR) manifested by normal steroid binding and decreased VDR affinity for DNA. The phenotypically normal parents are heterozygous, expressing both normal and defective forms of VDR. The affected children in this family had early-onset rickets, alopecia, hypocalcemia, and elevated serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels. The VDR of cultured skin fibroblasts of the affected children (G1 and G2) as well as the parents (G3 and G4) bound [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 normally (Kd = 2-3 X 10(-11) mol/L; maximal number of binding sites = 20-40 fmol/mg protein). The cells from G1 and G2 were resistant to 1,25-(OH)2D3 action, as measured by induction of 24-hydroxylase activity, while the cells from G3 and G4 responded normally. Western blot analysis using the anti-VDR monoclonal antibody 9A7 showed that hypertonic extracts of fibroblasts from both affected children (G1 and G2) and their parents (G3 and G4) had immunoreactive bands of 48K, identical to the size of the VDR in normal cells. The VDR from G1 and G2 eluted as a single peak from DNA-cellulose columns at a lower salt concentration (0.1 mol/L) than that from normal subjects (0.2 mol/L), indicating an apparent decreased affinity for DNA. Fibroblast VDR from G3 and G4 each eluted from DNA-cellulose columns as two peaks, the normal peak (0.2 mol/L) and the abnormal peak (0.1 mol/L), which was found in G1 and G2. Western blot analysis of the 0.1 and 0.2 mol/L KCl peak fractions also confirmed that VDR was present in only the 0.1 mol/L fraction and not the 0.2 mol/L fraction from G1. However, VDR was present in both fractions from G3. In summary, this vitamin D-dependent rickets, type II, kindred has a defect in the DNA-binding domain of VDR. The parents are phenotypically normal and express both the normal and defective VDR alleles, as demonstrated by both DNA-cellulose chromatography and Western blot analysis. The affected children are resistant to 1,25-(OH)2D3 action and are homozygous for the defective VDR.\r"

  ".W": "GH secretion in response to provocative stimuli is decreased in obese individuals. However, the precise mechanism causing this decrease is unknown. In an attempt to determine if reduced cholinergic stimulation accounts for the decreased GH secretion, we studied the effect of enhanced cholinergic tone induced by pyridostigmine on GHRH-stimulated GH secretion in a group of seven obese and seven normal subjects. When GHRH (100 micrograms, iv) was administered after placebo in the obese group, mean plasma GH rose from 0.5 +/- (0.1 (+/- SE) to 3.6 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L at 30 min. When the same obese subjects were given GHRH 60 min after pyridostigmine administration (120 mg, orally), the mean plasma GH level rose from 1.8 +/- 0.6 to 21.0 +/- 7.5 micrograms/L at 30 min. The responses to placebo and pyridostigmine were significantly different at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min. In the normal subjects, a similar dose of GHRH induced a GH peak of 24.3 +/- 7.1 micrograms/L, and the GHRH-stimulated peak was significantly higher (56.2 +/- 16.8 micrograms/L) after pyridostigmine administration. To study the effect of pyridostigmine alone six other obese and six other normal subjects were tested with pyridostigmine or placebo on different days. In the normal subjects the mean peak plasma GH level after pyridostigmine was 12.5 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L, and in the obese subjects it was 4.6 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L. Thus, pyridostigmine potentiated the action of GHRH, rather than merely being additive. We conclude that pyridostigmine stimulates GH secretion in obese as well as normal subjects, although the response was less in the former group. Pyridostigmine potentiates the response to GHRH in both groups, but again, the response was less in the obese subjects. These results suggest that the impaired somatotroph responsiveness in obese subjects may be due to chronically decreased hypothalamic cholinergic tone, resulting in enhanced somatostatinergic tone.\r"

  ".W": "To further elucidate the neuroendocrine regulation of anterior pituitary function in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), we measured serum LH, FSH, cortisol, GH, PRL, TSH concentrations simultaneously at frequent intervals for 24 h in 10 women with FHA and in 10 normal women in the early follicular phase (NC). Using the same data, we separately analyzed the cortisol-PRL responses to meals in these women. In addition, the pituitary responses to the simultaneous administration of GnRH, CRH, GHRH, and TRH were assessed in 6 FHA and 6 normal women. The 24-h secretory pattern of each hormone except TSH was altered in the women with FHA. Compared to normal women, the women with FHA had a 53% reduction in LH pulse frequency (P less than 0.0001) and an increase in the mean LH interpulse interval (P less than 0.01); LH pulse amplitude was similar. The 24-h integrated LH and FSH concentrations were reduced 30% (P = 0.01) and 19% (P less than 0.05), respectively. The mean cortisol pulse frequency, amplitude, interpulse interval, and duration were similar in the two groups, but integrated 24-h cortisol secretion was 17% higher in the women with FHA (P less than 0.05). This increase was greatest from 0800-1600 h, but also was present from 2400-0800 h. Cortisol levels were similar in the two groups from 1600-2400 h, resulting in an amplified circadian excursion. In contrast, the 24-h serum PRL levels were markedly lower at all times (P less than 0.0001), the sleep-associated nocturnal elevation of PRL was proportionately greater (P less than 0.05), and serum GH levels were increased at night in the women with FHA (P less than 0.05). Although 24-h serum TSH levels were similar at all times, T3 (P less than 0.05) and T4 (P less than 0.01) levels were lower in the FHA women. The responses of serum cortisol to lunch (P less than 0.01) and dinner (P less than 0.05) and those of serum PRL to lunch (P less than 0.05) and dinner (P = 0.08) were blunted in the women with FHA. Pituitary hormone increments in response to the simultaneous iv administration of GnRH, CRH, GHRH, and TRH were similar in the two groups, except for a blunted PRL response to TRH in the women with FHA (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied in vivo and in vitro steroidogenesis in six phenotypic female children with 17-hydroxylase deficiency. The diagnosis was suspected as a likely cause of familial low renin hypertension and was confirmed by findings of reduced basal and ACTH-stimulated serum and urinary levels of cortisol and other 17-hydroxysteroids, together with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in both 46,XY and 46,XX patients, and abnormally increased secretion of 17-desoxysteroids, such as progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone. ACTH stimulation testing demonstrated a lesser degree of 17-hydroxylase deficiency in the obligate heterozygous parents; one father had increased basal serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone values, unresponsive to ACTH, suggesting partial Leydig cell 17,20-desmolase deficiency. In vitro kinetic analysis of testicular microsomal enzymes in the affected 46,XY male pseudohermaphrodites confirmed that both 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-desmolase activities were less than 2% of those in age-matched normal subjects. However, in spite of this virtual absence of both enzymatic activities of cytochrome P450c17, Northern blot analysis demonstrated abundant amounts of RNA in these tests that hybridized to a cDNA specific for this P450 enzyme. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved testicular microsomes showed an apparently normal content of an immunoreactive protein with a mol wt similar to that of authentic P450c17. These results suggest that these patients have a point mutation in the gene for P450c17; the mutant gene is transcribed, but gives rise to a protein defective in normal 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-desmolase activities.\r"

The results were compared with those of 26 antibody-negative homosexual men (HH-) who served as controls. The mean serum total testosterone concentration was significantly lower in the men with AIDS [414 +/- 230 (+/- SD) ng/dL (14.5 +/- 8.0)] than in the HH- men [550 +/- 172 ng/dL (19.0 +/- 6.0 nmol/L); P less than 0.05]. The mean serum LH level was significantly higher in the men with AIDS (26 +/- 14 vs. 14 +/- 4 IU/L in HH- men; P less than 0.01) and slightly but significantly higher in the men with ARC (19 +/- 8 IU/L; 0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05).

Serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels were similar in HH- men and men with AIDS as were serum T responses to hCG administration for 2 days. These results suggest that alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis indicative of primary hypogonadism accompany human immunodeficiency virus infection in homosexual men.\r"

To investigate the site of action of CV 205-502, three groups of five men were given single daily doses of CV 205-502 (0.04, 0.06, or 0.08 mg/day, doses that suppress plasma PRL by 60-80% for 24 h) for 5 days; on day 6 a combined anterior pituitary function test using iv administration of four hypothalamic releasing hormones (TRH, 200 micrograms; GHRH, 100 micrograms; CRH, 100 micrograms; LHRH, 100 micrograms) was performed. One month later the challenge tests were repeated to obtain control values. The following hormones were measured by RIA in plasma: TSH, ACTH, cortisol, PRL, GH, LH, FSH, and testosterone. With the exception of plasma PRL levels, basal and releasing hormone-stimulated values were similar after CV 205-502 administration and after the 1-month washout period. Basal plasma PRL was lower after CV 205-502 administration, and the response to TRH was attenuated by all three doses of CV 205-502 (the mean percent inhibition values were 76%, 93%, and 94%, respectively). All three doses of CV 205-502 were well tolerated, and another group of men well tolerated 0.1 mg daily. The results confirm that CV 205-502 is a potent dopamine agonist, which directly inhibits lactotropic cells but has no effect on other pituitary cell types.\r"

Blood samples were collected at 0600-0630 h on awakening for measurement of plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), total and free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, FSH, PRL, T4, T4-binding globulin, and cortisol. The plasma hormone levels were analyzed in relation to the severity of sleep apnea, as indicated by the desaturation index (the hourly rate of episodes of arterial oxygen desaturation greater than 4% of the stable baseline) and the mean minimal oxygen saturation during the desaturation episodes. In the cross-sectional study plasma IGF-I, free and total testosterone, and SHBG levels were significantly lower in relation to the severity of sleep apnea, whereas plasma LH, FSH, PRL, T4, T4-binding globulin, and cortisol were not. The decreases in plasma IGF-I and total and free testosterone were independent of the effects of aging and adiposity by covariance analysis. In the longitudinal study plasma IGF-I, total testosterone, and SHBG, but not free testosterone, significantly increased after 3 months of nasal continuous positive airways pressure treatment. We conclude that sleep apnea causes reversible neuroendocrine dysfunction in men, which is manifested by decreased plasma. IGF-I, testosterone, and SHBG levels. This neuroendocrine dysfunction is related to the severity of the sleep apnea, as indicated by the nadir levels of arterial oxygen desaturation and the rate of desaturation episodes. These hormonal measurements may provide biochemical markers for both the severity of sleep apnea and its response to therapeutic intervention. In addition, sleep apnea may be a previously unrecognized confounder of the neuroendocrine correlates of aging.\r"

A rapid and dramatic increase in serum FSH concentrations occurred after each hFSH injection, followed by a gradual decrease. Serum LH concentrations, including hourly fluctuations, were significantly higher after FSH administration than after NaCl injection at the same time during the preceding cycle. Neither serum progesterone nor testosterone levels were affected by the hFSH injection in any of the 3 luteal phases, but in the early and midluteal phases serum estradiol levels were higher than the preinjection values and those during the control cycles. These results indicate that FSH stimulates aromatization of luteal tissue in vivo as it does in vitro. Thus, FSH in addition to LH as the indispensable luteotropin may have a permissive role in the regulation of corpus luteum function.\r"

Serum dihydrotestosterone concentrations increased to supranormal values in all of the men, decreased to the normal range in 6, indicating the biological effectiveness of the testosterone in those subjects. Two men whose serum LH concentrations did not fall to normal had small or distorted scrotal surfaces. Seven of the 8 men whose serum testosterone concentrations became normal said that their hypogonadal symptoms were corrected by this treatment. We conclude that the transdermal administration of testosterone is an effective means of treating the majority of hypogonadal men who have a normal scrotum.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone (T) administration slows LH pulse frequency in man, presumably by an effect on the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, but it also may have a direct action on the pituitary. To determine if T does indeed affect gonadotropin secretion by acting directly on the pituitary, we studied the effect of T on GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion. Six men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were treated with physiological doses of GnRH (5 micrograms every 2 h, sc by automatic infusion pump) for 6 weeks. Once their gonadotropin levels were normal, the men received a supraphysiological dosage of T enanthate (200 mg, im, weekly for 8 weeks) in addition to GnRH. They then received GnRH alone for a final 8-week period. Blood sampling was performed every 10 min for 8 h at the end of each of the three study periods. T administration suppressed the mean serum LH level to about 50% of the value during GnRH alone [18 +/- 2 (+/- SE) vs. 37 +/- 2 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05] and suppressed the mean serum FSH level to about 30% of the value during GnRH alone (39 +/- 6 vs. 128 +/- 28 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). Eight weeks after stopping T, while continuing GnRH alone, serum LH and FSH levels were similar to those at the end of the first period of GnRH administration. The mean LH response to GnRH was reduced during T administration (17 +/- 3 micrograms/L) compared to that during the initial period of GnRH alone (31 +/- 4 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). Serum T and estradiol levels were in the low normal range after GnRH alone before T administration (11 +/- 2 nmol/L and 105 +/- 17 pmol/L, respectively) and increased to just above the normal adult ranges after 8 weeks of T administration (36 +/- 5 nmol/L and 264 +/- 49 pmol/L, respectively). These results demonstrate that T and/or its metabolites inhibit LH and FSH secretion by a GnRH-independent mechanism, probably directly on the pituitary gland, in man.\r"

  ".W": "The functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes was assessed by determining pulsatile LH, ACTH, and cortisol secretion during the early follicular phase in athletic women with regular menstrual cycles (CA; n = 9), athletic women with amenorrhea (AA; n = 9), and regularly cyclic sedentary women (CS; n = 8). The CA and AA women were not significantly different in body composition, exercise training, psychometric tests, or dietary consumption. The CA women had shorter luteal phases (P less than 0.05) and lower urinary excretion of pregnanediol glucuronide than the CS women. In the AA women, urinary estrone glucuronide, pregnanediol glucuronide, and LH excretion were low throughout a 30-day period. The CA women had a 24-h pattern of pulsatile LH secretion characterized by reduced frequency (P less than 0.05) and increased amplitude (P less than 0.05), yielding an overall increased 24-h mean level (P less than 0.05), but interpulse intervals similar to those in the CS women. During sleep, LH pulse frequency slowed in the CS and CA women, while pulse amplitude increased and the mean serum LH level decreased in both groups. The AA women had even fewer pulses (P less than 0.05) of normal amplitude occurring at much more variable (P less than 0.01) interpulse intervals. Sleep-associated changes in LH pulsatility were absent. Responses to a 10-microgram bolus GnRH dose revealed blunted (P less than 0.05) FSH release in CA and augmented (P less than 0.05) LH release in AA women. The groups did not differ in any 24-h ACTH pulse pattern parameter or in cortisol pulse frequencies. Yet, early morning (0200-0800 h) serum cortisol levels were higher (P less than 0.05) in both groups of athletes, and this elevation was extended through the day (0800-2000 h; P less than 0.001) and evening (2000-0200 h; P less than 0.05) in the AA women. The plasma ACTH and serum cortisol responses to bolus human CRH administration were blunted in the CA and AA women [change from baseline (delta) in ACTH, P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01; delta cortisol, P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.01, respectively], but adrenal sensitivity (delta cortisol/delta ACTH ratio) was increased (P less than 0.05). The plasma ACTH and serum cortisol responses to meals also were blunted in the athletic groups (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A Negative correlation between spermatozoa output and serum gonadotropin levels, as well as between scrotal temperature and spermatozoa output, has been found in man. However, no studies have been done on the relationship between scrotal temperature and serum gonadotropin levels. This paper reports such data from 212 infertile men. The upper limit for normal scrotal temperature was defined as the 90th percentile value (35.3 C) of a control group of 64 fertile men whose mean serum FSH and LH levels were 6.0 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) and 6.4 +/- 0.7 IU/L, respectively. This value for scrotal temperature (35.3 C) was used to classify infertile men into 3 groups: bilateral hyperthermia (n = 56), unilateral hyperthermia (n = 40), and bilateral normothermia (n = 116). In the unilateral and bilateral hyperthermic groups serum LH and FSH levels were significantly increased compared with those in the normothermic group. The mean serum testosterone values were similar in all groups. To study the relationships between serum gonadotropin levels or spermatozoa output and scrotal temperature, the infertile men also were divided into classes according to their spermatozoa output. These classes were subdivided into two groups, normothermic or hyperthermic, according to whether the left scrotal temperature was equal to or less than, or more than 35.3 C. For the infertile men whose spermatozoa output was more than 60 X 10(6) spermatozoa/ejaculate (normospermia), there was no significant difference between the serum gonadotropin levels of the normothermic (n = 42) and the hyperthermic (n = 20) groups. Among the oligospermic men (spermatozoa output, 0.1-60 X 10(6) spermatozoa/ejaculate), the hyperthermic group (n = 65) had significantly higher serum gonadotropin levels and significantly smaller testicular volumes than the normothermic group (n = 71). The two oligospermic groups also had significantly higher serum FSH values than the infertile normospermic groups. These results were not linked to the presence of a varicocele or a history of cryptorchidism, as the prevalence of varicocele and cryptorchidism was equally distributed within the groups studied. We conclude that the increase in serum gonadotropin levels in the case of a decrease in spermatozoa output is significantly greater in the presence of associated scrotal hyperthermia.\r"

  ".W": "LHRH antagonists compete with endogenous LHRH for binding to receptors on pituitary gonadotrophs and thereby inhibit gonadotropin secretion and, consequently, gonadal function. We studied the pituitary and gonadal suppression following single doses and short term administration (1-3 weeks) of a recently developed LHRH antagonist in normal men. First, the antagonist Nal-Glu ([Ac-D2Nal1, D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA),DAla10]LHRH ), was given as a single sc injection to five normal men at three dose levels of 1, 5, and 20 mg (study I). Serum FSH, immunoreactive LH (IR-LH), bioactive LH (bio-LH), testosterone, and estradiol were measured before and at frequent intervals for 48 h after Nal-Glu administration. Mean serum FSH decreased (P less than 0.001) by 28.9 +/- 5.4% (+/- SE), 38.2 +/- 7.9%, and 44.5 +/- 3.6% after the 1-, 5-, and 20-mg doses, respectively. Mean serum IR-LH decreased (P less than 0.001) by 39.0 +/- 13.8%, 53.2 +/- 10.0%, and 53.1 +/- 14.4% after the three doses. Serum bio-LH levels and the ratio of bio-LH/IR-LH decreased (P less than 0.001) after the 20-mg dose by 87.8% and 78.5%, respectively. Serum testosterone levels decreased (P less than 0.001) more than 78.5% after all Nal-Glu doses. The duration of testosterone suppression, but not the nadir reached, was dose dependent (P = 0.012). Serum estradiol levels also decreased (P less than 0.001), but the rate of decrease was slower than that of serum testosterone. The apparent plasma disappearance half-life of Nal-Glu after administration of 5 mg was 12.8 +/- 2.7 h. The Nal-Glu antagonist also was given daily as a single sc injection of 5 mg to eight normal men for 21 days (study II) or twice daily to five men for 7 days (study III). In study II, serum FSH, IR-LH, bio-LH, testosterone, estradiol, and 17-hydroxy-progesterone were measured daily, immediately before the next injection, and on days 1, 7, and 21 in frequent blood samples drawn for 24 h. The mean serum testosterone level in study II decreased (P less than 0.001) from 17.6 +/- 2.2 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 nmol/L on day 1, increased (P less than 0.05) between days 2 and 8, and then progressively decreased to below 2 nmol/L from day 18 until 24 h after the end of the study. Serum FSH, IR-LH, and bio-LH levels paralleled those of testosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

One had substantial variations in serum CBG and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations during the menstrual cycle, which paralleled the normal cyclic changes in serum estradiol.

  ".W": "Cushing's disease may originate from either the anterior pituitary lobe or the neurointermediate lobe, a major characteristic of the latter group being bromocriptine responsiveness. This study of two patients with Cushing's disease demonstrates that bromocriptine responsiveness also may be associated with anterior pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia or a normal pituitary gland. The two patients were a 14-yr-old boy (patient 1) and a 29-yr-old woman (patient 2); their cortisol production rates were 121 and 234 mumol/24 h (normal values, less than 80 mumol/24 h), respectively. A single oral dose of 2.5 mg bromocriptine resulted in a gradual decrease in plasma cortisol from 680 to 130 nmol/L after 6 h in patient 1 and from 640 to 170 nmol/L after 4 h in patient 2. Both patients then received medical treatment for a period of 2 yr. Whereas sodium valproate was ineffective, bromocriptine (5 mg/day) abruptly decreased the cortisol production rate to 60 mumol/24 h in patient 1 and to 138 mumol/24 h in patient 2, and both patients had a partial clinical remission. Despite an increase in bromocriptine dosage to 30 mg daily and 24 mg/day cyproheptadine, the clinical and biochemical remission was not sustained in patient 1, and no further improvement occurred in patient 2. Total hypophysectomy then was performed in both patients. Sections of the pituitary from patient 1 showed diffuse anterior pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia, with early nodule formation in some areas. The sections from patient 2 showed normal numbers and distribution of corticotrophs. We conclude that the heterogeneous nature of Cushing's disease cannot be explained on the basis simply of anterior vs. intermediate lobe origin of the disease.\r"

GH and GHRH secretory patterns were assessed during intermittent sc administration, continuous sc infusion (CSI), and continuous iv infusion of octreotide. Octreotide reduced serum GH and plasma GHRH levels in the two patients, although there was differential sensitivity of GH and GHRH. Intermittent sc therapy transiently lowered serum GH in both patients. A higher iv dose was required to reduce plasma GHRH by 50% than to reduce serum GH by 50% (2.0 vs. 0.05 micrograms/kg.h, respectively; patient 1). A similar pattern was found during CSI octreotide administration in the same patient. Chronic therapy with intermittent sc and CSI octreotide was assessed by serial 24-h profiles of GH and GHRH secretion in patient 2. Mean hourly serum GH levels decreased from a pretreatment level of 31.5 +/- 3.5 (+/- SE) to 9.5 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L during CSI therapy (1000 micrograms/day or 0.40 micrograms/kg.h). In contrast, plasma GHRH levels were less effectively suppressed. The mean serum GH levels and the variation in hourly GH values were reduced to a greater extent with CSI than with intermittent sc therapy. Serum insulin-like growth factor I also declined from 5.9 x 10(3) to 2.5 x 10(3) U/L during chronic CSI therapy (patient 2). CSI therapy with octreotide can be more effective than intermittent sc therapy in controlling GH excess in the rare syndrome of ectopic GHRH secretion, although serum GH may not decline to normal.\r"

All had normal basal serum cortisol, T4, and PRL concentrations and normal serum cortisol and GH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and TSH responses to TRH. Of the 11 male patients (all over 17 yr of age), only 3 attained full pubertal development and 4 had subnormal serum LH and FSH responses to GnRH. As a group, their mean basal serum testosterone (T) level was low [11.7 +/- 4.9 (+/- SE) nmol/L; normal, 10-40 nmol/L], and 9 of the 11 male patients responded to hCG with a rise in serum T. Two of the 3 female patients over 17 yr of age were prepubertal with undetectable serum estradiol (E2) levels and absent serum LH and FSH responses to GnRH; the other female patient had regular menstrual cycles and normal serum E2 levels and LH and FSH responses to GnRH. Six of the prepubertal patients (4 males and 2 females, aged 17-30 yr) were studied serially for 3 yr after the start of chelation therapy. Despite a fall of median serum ferritin from 11,910 to 1,303 pmol/L, there was no progression of puberty, and their basal and GnRH-stimulated serum LH and FSH and serum T or E2 levels did not change. Three of these patients (1 male and 2 female) then received pulsatile sc GnRH therapy in addition to chelation therapy for 6 months with no improvement. We conclude that chronic iron overload in patients with severe thalassemia leads to variable degrees of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which do not respond to chelation therapy given late in the course of the disease. The hypogonadism in most patients was due to pituitary hyporesponsiveness to GnRH.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the inhibitory effect of exogenous CRH on pulsatile gonadotropin secretion and the role of endogenous opioid peptides in this phenomenon in normal women. To do so, we infused human CRH (100 micrograms/h for 3 h) into 15 normal women during the midluteal phase of their menstrual cycle and studied its effect on both basal (10 women) and GnRH-stimulated (5 women) plasma gonadotropin levels. CRH infusion induced a significant decrease in plasma LH and FSH levels in all women. The decline in plasma LH (62%) was greater than that in FSH (36%). Plasma LH and FSH concentrations returned to basal levels within 30 min after the end of the CRH infusion. CRH infusion did not alter the gonadotropin response to GnRH. We also infused naloxone plus CRH in the 10 women who had received CRH alone during the midluteal phase of a different cycle. Addition of naloxone to CRH (5 women) reversed the LH and FSH inhibition when naloxone was started 1 h after the start of the CRH infusion. When naloxone was started 1 h before CRH infusion (5 women), plasma LH and FSH concentrations did not change. Plasma cortisol increased similarly during both the CRH and CRH plus naloxone infusions; the mean cortisol levels at the end of the CRH and CRH plus naloxone infusions were 497 +/- 40 (+/- SE) and 484 +/- 41 nmol/L, respectively, compared to 240 +/- 14 nmol/L after saline infusion (P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that in normal women during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle, CRH inhibits the secretion of both LH and FSH. The CRH-induced inhibition of gonadotropin secretion is primarily mediated by endogenous opioid peptides, and this effect is not dependent on glucocorticoid levels. We suggest that the disruptive effect of stress on reproductive function in the women could be, at least in part, dependent on decreased gonadotropin secretion induced by elevated endogenous CRH levels.\r"

The in vivo t1/2 of GH in seven men was calculated from serum GH concentrations measured at frequent intervals after beginning the SRIH infusion. The mean t1/2 of endogenous GH was 18.9 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) min by monoexponential analysis and 3.5 +/- 0.7 and 20.7 +/- 0.7 min by biexponential fitting. In these normal men, the decline in GH concentrations after GHRH and SRIH administration was similar to that after the administration of GHRH alone, which yielded a t1/2 of 20.3 +/- 1.9 min. We conclude that the physiological kinetics of endogenous GH removal/disappearance can be estimated in vivo in man using GHRH with or without SRIH infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis is a known consequence of anorexia nervosa (AN) in adults, but the mechanism of bone loss is not established, and there have been no studies of bone mass in women developing AN before attaining peak bone mass. To investigate the causes of bone loss in AN and to determine the consequences of developing AN during adolescence on bone mass, we compared the effects of AN on cortical and trabecular bone in 26 women with AN (19 adults, 18-42 yr old, and 7 adolescents, 14.9-17.0 yr old) using direct radial photon absorptiometry and both single and dual energy spinal computed tomography. The adult AN patients had marked spinal osteopenia [mean bone density, 120 +/- 28 (+/- SD) mg K2HPO4/cm3] compared with age-matched normal women (mean, 176 +/- 26 mg K2HPO4/cm3; P = 0.0001), which was severe (greater than 2 SD below the normal mean) in 50% of patients. Adult AN patients with the onset of amenorrhea before age 18 yr had significantly (P = 0.04) lower spinal bone density than those developing amenorrhea later (mean, 103 +/- 25 vs. 129 +/- 25 mg K2HPO4/cm3) independent of other variables correlated with bone density (duration of amenorrhea or urinary cortisol excretion). We found a negative correlation between spinal bone density and duration of amenorrhea (P = 0.006; r = -0.53). To determine the contribution of endogenous cortisol excess to the pathogenesis of the osteoporosis, urinary cortisol was measured. Urinary cortisol/creatinine clearance was significantly (P = 0.001) higher in AN patients than in normal women (mean, 2.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.3 nmol/L) and was negatively correlated (P = 0.03; r = -0.43) with bone mass. We conclude that AN affects trabecular bone and that both the onset of AN before attainment of peak bone mass and prolonged duration of amenorrhea result in more severe osteopenia. In addition to the significant contribution of hypogonadism, the cortisol excess that occurs in AN patients may contribute to the development of osteoporosis in these patients.\r"

In this study we investigated whether normal human pituitary tissue and GH-secreting human pituitary adenomas could release somatostatin (SRIH) and GHRH. Fragments from three human pituitaries and dispersed cells from six GH-secreting adenomas (four adenomas were studied for GHRH release and five for SRIH release) were perifused using a Krebs-Ringer culture medium, and the perifusion medium was collected every 2 min (1 mL/fraction for 5 h). GH, GHRH, and SRIH were measured by RIA under basal conditions and in the presence of 10(-6) mol/L TRH or SRIH. Both normal pituitaries and GH-secreting pituitary adenomas released SRIH and GHRH. SRIH release commenced 90-180 min after initiation of the perifusion, at which time GH secretion had decreased significantly. TRH stimulated SRIH release from normal pituitary tissue and inhibited SRIH release from adenoma tissue. GHRH was present at the start of the perifusion, but rapidly disappeared. However, SRIH stimulated GHRH release from normal pituitary tissue, but not from adenoma tissue. Significant amounts of GHRH and SRIH were released during the experiments, suggesting their local synthesis. These results indicate that pituitary cells can release hypothalamic peptides. The liberation of these neuropeptides is regulated, and moreover, their regulation differs between normal and adenomatous pituitaries.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of blockade of neonatal activation of the pituitary-testicular axis, using a GnRH agonist, on sexual development in male rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were treated with either a GnRH agonist (10 micrograms/day; n = 8) or vehicle (n = 9) for 112 days using osmotic minipumps beginning at 10-13 days of age. In control monkeys serum LH and testosterone concentrations during the first 3 postnatal months were similar to those in adults; they then declined to very low levels. GnRH agonist administration caused an immediate and precipitous decline in serum LH and testosterone concentrations to very low levels, and both remained low throughout the rest of the agonist administration period. Neither group had any significant elevation in serum LH or testosterone concentrations during the next 2 yr. In the control monkeys serum LH and testosterone began to rise during the third year, with a rapid increase occurring during the fall coincident with the breeding season. This peripubertal rise of LH and testosterone secretion was associated with rapid enlargement of the testes and the appearance of sperm in ejaculates. The monkeys who had received GnRH agonist had subnormal serum LH and testosterone increases, and testicular enlargement was also attenuated compared to that in the control animals during the third year of life. Semen samples were recovered from only 50% of the GnRH agonist-treated monkeys during this period, and the sperm count per ejaculate was suppressed. The serum LH responses of the GnRH agonist-treated monkeys to an iv bolus dose of GnRH (5 micrograms/kg BW) during the third year were normal. These results suggest that the induction of reversible hypogonadotropin-hypogonadism in neonatal male monkeys alters subsequent testicular development and peripubertal endocrine changes. Thus, neonatal activation of the pituitary-testicular axis may be a critical developmental event in the process of sexual development in male primates.\r"

In this study we measured basal and TRH-stimulated serum TSH and PRL levels in 15 women with PMS and in 19 age-matched normal women. The mean baseline serum TSH concentrations were similar in the 2 groups in both the follicular [normal, 1.3 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE); PMS, 0.9 +/- 0.2 mU/L] and luteal (normal, 1.1 +/- 0.2; PMS, 1.1 +/- 0.2 mU/L) phases of the cycle. The mean baseline serum PRL levels also were similar in the 2 groups in the follicular (normal, 16 +/- 2; PMS, 13 +/- 2 micrograms/L) and luteal (normal, 13 +/- 2; PMS, 14 +/- 2 micrograms/L) phases of the cycle. After TRH administration, peak serum PRL and TSH levels were reached at 15 and 30 min, respectively, and the response curves were virtually identical in the 2 groups in both phases of the cycle. One normal woman had elevated basal and TRH-stimulated TSH concentrations compatible with subclinical hypothyroidism, but had normal noncyclic scores on her prospective rating scales. Our findings suggest that PMS is not associated with thyroid dysfunction or abnormal PRL secretion and that thyroid hormone replacement therapy is not indicated in this condition.\r"

  ".U": "89139782\r", 
  ".W": "We used the reverse hemolytic plaque assay to study the dynamics of GH secretion by individual pituitary adenoma cells from eight acromegalic patients. There was a considerable variation between the adenomas with respect to the percentages of GH-secreting cells (25-78.5%) and also with respect to the amount of GH released per individual pituitary adenoma cell (mean plaque areas varying from 901-3559 micron 2). The GH plaque area frequency distributions from the adenoma cells were not normally distributed, but revealed a preponderance of small plaques, defined as those with areas smaller than the mean plaque area. The large plaques, that is those with areas larger than the mean plaque area, constituted 24-38% of the total cell population from different tumors and accounted for a large fraction (63-80%) of the total plaque area (the total amount of GH released by the adenoma cells). The somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 caused a shift in the GH plaque area frequency distributions toward smaller plaques, but had no effect on the overall percentages of GH plaque-forming cells in three of the five adenomas in which it was studied. This finding suggests that the adenoma cells from these patients that formed large plaques were preferentially inhibited by SMS 201-995. GHRH (studied in two adenomas) and TRH (studied in one adenoma) had no preferential effect on any subpopulation of adenoma cells. We conclude that GH secretion by individual somatotroph adenoma cells is highly variable both within and between adenomas and that SMS 201-995 has a preferential inhibitory effect on a subpopulation of adenoma cells in some adenomas.\r"

All patients underwent three single-blind placebo periods, each lasting 1 week. An exercise treadmill test, 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring (analyzed blindly) and an accurate diary of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin use were obtained at the end of each placebo period. An unbalanced, completely random component of variance analysis was used to calculate a component for within subject variability and a component for among subject variability. The coefficient of variation and percent variation (within subjects) of onset of chest pain during exercise were 19% and 30%, respectively; the corresponding values were 28% and 33% for onset of 1 mm ST depression, 15% and 15% for exercise duration, 44% and 27% for number of ischemic episodes/24 h, 56% and 43% for anginal frequency and 55% and 27% for nitroglycerin consumption, respectively. With use of this statistical method and variation within subjects, the change in the value of each variable necessary to exceed those attributable to spontaneous variation was determined. The trade-off between repeated measurements and number of subjects, the sample size estimated for planning studies and the minimal sample size for using various designs were also determined. Although the data indicate that all indexes for myocardial ischemia, both during exercise and during daily activity, vary considerably, but the exercise variables have less variability and are more reproducible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 108 patients received either 10 capsules of fish oil (1.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.2 g docosahexaenoic acid) or 10 control capsules (50% olive oil, 50% corn oil), commencing the day before angioplasty and continuing for 4 months after angioplasty, in addition to treatment with aspirin and verapamil. In 101 (94%) of the 108 patients, follow-up angiographic or postmortem result was evaluated at a mean (+/- SD) of 100 (+/- 22) days. Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of patients (29% of lesions) in the fish oil-treated group and 33% of patients (31% of lesions) in the control group (no significant difference). The overall incidence of angiographic restenosis was significantly higher in patients with 1) recurrent angina pectoris, 2) a positive exercise test at follow-up after angioplasty, 3) residual stenosis greater than 30% immediately after angioplasty, and 4) dilation of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery. Biochemical investigations showed a greater decrease in the serum triglyceride levels in the fish oil-treated group versus the control group (p less than 0.05) but no differences between the two groups in cholesterol levels or platelet counts over the 4 month period. In conclusion, in this study, the administration of fish oil at a dose of 10 capsules/day did not reduce the incidence of early restenosis after coronary angioplasty.\r"

In addition to described actions that include inhibition of immunologic release of histamine from mast cells and basophils, blockade of smooth muscle contraction to various spasmogenic mediators, and relaxation of airway smooth muscle, azelastine has been ascribed anti-inflammatory properties. To understand further the mechanisms by which azelastine may regulate inflammation, its effect on neutrophil and eosinophil superoxide (O2-) generation was evaluated. Purified suspension of neutrophils (greater than 95% pure) and eosinophils (greater than 85% pure) were isolated from human peripheral blood samples by continuous density gradients of Percoll. The isolated granulocyte suspensions (1 x 10(5) cells) were added to 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of cytochrome c, activated by either N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, phorbol myristate acetate, calcium ionophore A23187, or opsonized zymosan particles; O2- generation was measured by the reduction of cytochrome c. We found that azelastine significantly inhibited both neutrophil and eosinophil generation of O2- in a dose-dependent fashion (10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L) with each activator except zymosan. Furthermore, the degree to which azelastine suppressed O2- was similar in neutrophils and eosinophils. Thus, azelastine, in concentrations achieved therapeutically, inhibited granulocyte generation of O2-. This anti-inflammatory effect may also be beneficial in the treatment of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in autoimmune arthritis, we tested the effects of IFN-gamma and anti-IFN-gamma mAb (DB-1) in various phases of arthritis development in a rat model for rheumatoid arthritis; the adjuvant arthritis (AA) model, induced by immunization with CFA. In addition, the effects of IFN-gamma were tested in vitro on T cell clones derived from rats afflicted with AA. T cell clone A2b, which has been shown to be arthritogenic secreted low amounts of IFN-gamma and its Ag-specific proliferation was inhibited by IFN-gamma. In contrast, clone A2c, which can inhibit the development of AA, produced high amounts of IFN-gamma and its proliferation was increased by IFN-gamma. In vivo administration of IFN-gamma 24 h before CFA caused an enhancement of arthritis, whereas giving IFN-gamma 24 to 48 h after CFA suppressed the disease. Administration of IFN-gamma between day +4 to +12 or between day +12 to +24 increased the severity of the first phase of the disease, but had no effect later. Administration of DB-1 1 to 2 days before adjuvant or between day +4 to +8 substantially decreased the disease, whereas DB-1 given from day +12 to +24 significantly enhanced it. Taken together, these results illustrate the heterogeneity of IFN-gamma in autoimmune arthritis and suggest a rational explanation for the possibly conflicting reports regarding the role(s) and effects of IFN-gamma in autoimmune processes. The multistage nature of T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis may be due to the predominance of distinct T cell populations at different stages of the disease. The differences in the biologic activities of these T cells may be due to their patterns of lymphokine production.\r"

  ".U": "89140345\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of IL-4 on the production of Ig by human B cells was examined. Highly purified B cells were stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and IL-4 alone or in combination with various other cytokines and the supernatants assayed for Ig by isotype-specific ELISA. IL-4 (10 to 100 U/ml) did not support Ig secretion by SA-stimulated blood, spleen, or lymph node B cells, whereas IL-2 supported the production of all isotypes including IgE. Moreover, IL-4 suppressed the production of all isotypes of Ig by B cells stimulated with SA and IL-2 including IgG1, IgG2, and IgE. IL-4-mediated suppression was partially reversed by IFN-gamma or -alpha and low m.w. B cell growth factor. TNF-alpha and IL-6 did not reverse the IL-4-induced suppression of Ig production. The inhibitory action of IL-4 on Ig production appeared to depend on the polyclonal activator used to stimulate the B cells. Thus, Ig secretion by B cells activated by LPS and supported by IL-2 was not inhibited by IL-4. Whereas IL-4 alone supported minimal Ig production by LPS-activated B cells, it augmented production of all Ig isotypes in cultures stimulated with LPS and supported by IL-2. IFN-gamma further enhanced production of Ig in these cultures. When the effect of IL-4 on the responsiveness of B cells preactivated with SA and IL-2 was examined, it was found not to inhibit but rather to promote Ig production modestly. A direct effect of IL-4 on the terminal differentiation of B cells was demonstrated using B lymphoblastoid cell lines. IL-4 was able to enhance the Ig secreted by an IgA-secreting hybridoma, 219 and by SKW6-CL-4, an IL-6-responsive IgM-secreting EBV transformed B cell line. These results indicate that IL-4 exerts a number of immunoregulatory actions on human B cell differentiation. It interferes with the activation of B cells by SA and IL-2, but promotes the differentiation of preactivated B cells, B cell lines, and B cells activated by LPS without apparent isotype specificity.\r"

The C57BL/10 strain expresses the same idiotype at high levels, whereas the CWB/12 strain, which was derived by replacing the Ig H chain Igh-Cj allele of C3H.SW with the Igh-Cb allele derived from C57B1/10, has been found to express little of this dominant idiotype. CWB/12 responds, with titers equal to those of the parental strains, to the I-E epitope responsible for dominant idiotype expression, and it expresses normal V kappa 21 levels; thus deficiencies in epitope-specific responsiveness or in V kappa 21 expression cannot explain the low Id expression in CWB/12. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of three VH families gave no evidence of recombination within the the VH locus of CWB/12, which was Igh-Vb throughout. Black-cross analysis demonstrated that expression of the dominant idiotype segregated independently of Ig allotype, and was therefore due to genes unlinked to the H chain gene locus. To our knowledge, this pattern of Id expression is unprecedented, and indicates the need for caution in the interpretation of studies using allotype congenic strains. It also demonstrates a role for genes outside the Igh locus in the control of Id expression.\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin (PT) has been shown to have a variety of effects on T lymphocyte function, and its activity has been used to suggest the involvement of a G protein in the early events of T lymphocyte activation. In this report, the effects of PT on T lymphocytes have been investigated in detail. PT at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml rapidly stimulated early events that are normally induced by occupancy of the TCR complex in Jurkat cells and cloned, murine CTL including increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, serine esterase release, and induction of Ag non-specific target cell lysis. However, 1-h treatment with this concentration of PT induced a state that was refractory to further receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells but not cloned CTL although substrate membrane proteins were modified to a similar extent in both cell lines. The functional effects of PT were mimicked by the B oligomer of PT which did not, however, catalyze ADP-ribosylation of membrane proteins. In addition, overnight exposure of Jurkat cells to a lower concentration of PT also modified substrate membrane proteins but did not inhibit receptor stimulation. These findings indicate that PT catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a G protein does not account for the actions of the toxin on T lymphocytes. Finally, direct stimulation of increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration by PT and the B oligomer only occurred in T lymphocytes expressing CD3. This suggests that the mitogenic effect of PT holotoxin is mediated by the interaction of the B oligomer with CD3 and that this may account for many of the effects of PT holotoxin both in vivo and in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of cellular proteins was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis during and after exposure of mouse macrophages to either mouse rIFN-gamma or natural MuIFN-beta sufficient to prime macrophages for tumor cell killing. The reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CY), was included in some experiments during exposure to IFN. While it was present, CY suppressed protein synthesis by greater than 90%, but did not affect priming for tumor cell killing that was induced by either kind of IFN, as measured in cytotoxicity assays. Further analysis showed that, after CY and IFN were removed, protein synthesis recovered fully within 1 h. p47b, a protein that has been associated closely with the induction of the primed state in mouse macrophages, was then substantially expressed despite no new stimulation by IFN. Thus, macrophages in which protein synthesis had been reversibly inhibited delayed full processing of a signal delivered by IFN, until after protein synthesis had resumed. Such a delay in processing may explain how macrophages subsequently became activated, despite treatment with CY. The expression of the protein doublet, p71/73, was induced, regardless of which of three dissimilar agents (LPS, heat killed Listeria monocytogenes, poly I:C) was used to trigger the expression of cytolytic activity by primed macrophages. Therefore, the likelihood was increased that p71/73, expressed with p47b, is a valid phenotypic marker for fully activated, cytolytic macrophages. By contrast, p120, another protein that has been proposed as a marker of full activation in peritoneal macrophages, was expressed by bone marrow culture-derived macrophages regardless of whether or not they were cytolytic for tumor cells. It cannot be regarded as a reliable marker of macrophage activation in all circumstances, therefore.\r"

Their genetic origin, clonal diversity, and inducing agents, and the relatedness between RF associated with disease and those occurring under physiologic conditions are not well understood. In this study, the genetic and clonotypic origin of 34 monoclonal IgM RF-secreting hybridomas from arthritic MRL-lpr/lpr and nonarthritic MRL-+/+ and C57BL/6-lpr/lpr mice was examined by RNA hybridization. For this purpose, we used probes for 10 VH and 13 Vk gene families as well as all JH and Jk gene segments. The majority of hybridomas expressed distinct Ig gene segment patterns and, hence, were clonally unrelated. Overall, a variety of different V and J gene segments were expressed in the hybridoma panel, suggesting that a large number of distinct genetic elements participates in expression of RF-like activity. RF from arthritic mice expressed Vk messages from the overlapping Vk22 and Vk28 gene families more frequently than did those from nonarthritic mice. RF from autoimmune MRL mice, both arthritic MRL-lpr/lpr and nonarthritic MRL-+/+, showed skewed JH4 segment usage, whereas those from C57BL/6-lpr/lpr preferentially expressed JH2.\r"

Multiple sequence differences were found at the DR beta I, DQ alpha, and DQ beta loci when these two haplotypes were compared. The DR beta I allele found in the DRw14 DQw3 haplotype appears to have diverged primarily as a result of a gene conversion event with a DR1 allele acting as donor. In contrast, the DRw13 DQw1 haplotype appears to have arisen by means of a recombination event between the DR and DQ subregions. Thus, multiple genetic mechanisms, including point mutation, gene conversion, and recombination, have generated diversity among DRw6 haplotypes.\r"

Preincubation of the tumor lines with IFN-gamma or TNF enhanced susceptibility to lysis significantly; the combination of both cytokines was more effective than either alone. Pretreatment for at least 24 h was required to enhance lytic susceptibility and maximal lysis was observed after pretreatment for 48 to 72 h. Highly specific TIL lysed only their autologous tumor targets and failed to lyse cytokine pretreated allogeneic tumor cells. In TIL populations with varying specificity, cytokine pretreatment of targets enhanced autologous lysis as well as allogeneic lysis. This cytokine-mediated effect could also be observed in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay and did not correlate directly with enhanced expression of MHC class I Ag or the adhesion molecules LFA-3 and ICAM-1. These results suggest that enhancement of lysis may occur at a postbinding stage by making the target cell more sensitive to the cytotoxic factors delivered by the killer cell. The fact that lysis of cytokine treated targets by cells with LAK activity was not enhanced suggests that cells with lymphokine-activated killer activity and tumor-derived T cells kill tumor targets via different mechanisms.\r"

Our previous finding that weekly applications of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene deplete the numbers of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-positive LC was extended to show that LC are also depleted on Ia and beta-glucuronidase staining. In contrast, application of the tobacco-derived carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene (BP), caused a significant increase in Ia-positive LC density within 2 weeks and elevated levels were maintained for up to 6 months with continuous treatment. The tobacco-derived cocarcinogenic agent, catechol, also enhanced the numbers of epidermal LC. The LC in carcinogen treated epidermis were morphologically abnormal; after BP and catechol treatment LC appeared smaller with shorter dendrites, whereas in DMBA treated epidermis LC were enlarged with elongated dendrites. Application of the contact sensitizing agent, dinitrofluorobenzene, to skin treated with BP induced hyporesponsiveness rather than contact sensitivity upon subsequent antigen challenge. Hence, the function of the large number of morphologically altered LC in BP treated skin was impaired. We conclude that carcinogen-induced alterations of LC are associated with impaired immunocompetence, although different carcinogens probably operate via different mechanisms to induce such phenomena.\r"

Treatment of the keratinocytes with the phorbol ester, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, produced a six to 34-fold increase in procollagenase synthesis and secretion but only a threefold increase in the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Collagenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases mRNAs were present in normal keratinocytes, were the same size as their fibroblast counterparts, and both increased in response to treatment with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These data suggest that remodeling of type I collagen may be an important function of human keratinocytes in vivo.\r"

To study the interactions of C5a and C5a des Arg with these cells, fluorescein conjugates of these ligands were prepared by a new technique and their binding to monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells was studied with flow cytometry. Fluoresceinated C5a produced neutrophil myeloperoxidase release and chemotaxis and also bound rabbit anti-C5a antibody much like native anaphylatoxin; likewise, fluoresceinated C5a des Arg demonstrated retention of biologic and antigenic activities. Both fluorescein-conjugated C5a and C5a des Arg bound to monocytes and neutrophils in a concentration-dependent, saturable, and homogeneous manner, but 10- to 15-fold higher concentrations of C5a des Arg were required to attain saturable binding of these leukocytes. Ligand binding was specifically inhibited by native purified human C5a in a concentration-dependent manner, while it was unaffected by C3a or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-lysine. There was no evidence of a C5a receptor-negative subpopulation of monocytes or neutrophils. Moreover, comparative binding experiments with leukocytes from multiple normal volunteers showed that a greater percentage of monocytes than neutrophils bound C5a at less than saturable concentrations of ligand (P less than 0.05, 0.5 to 5.0 nM). A representative half-maximal binding of fluorescein-conjugated C5a (C5a des Arg) binding to monocytes and neutrophils was 1.2 nM (30 nM) and 2.6 nM (68 nM), respectively. In contrast, fluorescein-conjugated C5a did not specifically bind to human platelets or umbilical vein endothelial cells.\r"

Increased concentrations of prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha, and 6-oxo-F1 alpha were found in the medium subjected to UVB radiation followed by 24 h incubation in the organ culture, compared to medium from non-exposed skin, whereas LTC4 was at an undetectable level in both. This release occurred in UVB dose-dependent fashion and was completely inhibited by the addition of indomethacin to the medium. Exposure to monochromatic UV light of 250, 300, and 350 nm released prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha, and 6-oxo-F1 alpha, in increasing order of 250, 300, and 350 nm, but not LTC4. This order of amount released almost paralleled the intensity of inflammation that occurred with each wavelength. Exposure of skin to UVA following intraperitoneal injection of 8-methoxypsoralen (PUVA) was also found to stimulate the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in UVA dose-dependent fashion, and the stimulation through an increasing dose of UVA occurred more significantly than UVB exposure. The time course of prostaglandin release following UVB and PUVA exposures was found to have a pattern similar to their dynamics in association with erythema and edema, conditions which could be significantly diminished by the topical application of indomethacin. The present studies demonstrate that prostaglandins play an important role in the production of inflammation by UVB as well as UVA and PUVA.\r"

This tyrosine residue phosphorylation is thought to be one mechanism by which EGF mediates its effects such as growth stimulation. To modulate a cellular response to EGF, an enzyme which dephosphorylates phosphotyrosyl residues should be present to oppose the effect of the tyrosyl kinase activity of the EGF receptor. We have identified an enzyme in the neonatal mouse epidermis which has the ability to dephosphorylate tyrosyl residues in vitro on EGF receptors. This phosphatase is a soluble protein with a molecular weight greater than 10,000 daltons and shows optimum activity at neutral pH. This epidermal tyrosyl protein phosphatase is not inhibited by tartrate, ATP, and micromolar levels of zinc, but is inhibited by millimolar levels of zinc, magnesium, manganese, and fluoride. Unlike other well-known phosphotyrosyl phosphatases, alkaline phosphatase, and calcineurin, this enzyme is not inhibited by EDTA. Thus, we have identified and partially characterized a possibly unique phosphotyrosyl phosphatase from the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "The testicular function of 30 adolescent or adult males having undergone polychemotherapy in childhood was assessed by means of a spermogram or testicular biopsy. At the time of examination, the patients were pubertal and had completed chemotherapy between 1 and 20 years previously (mean, 9 years). All patients who were prepubertal or intrapubertal at the time of treatment achieved normal puberty with normal growth. Twenty patients presented with azoospermia and/or severe disturbances in the germinal line on biopsy. This series confirms the toxicity of alkylating agents, in particular that of the mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone combination (MOPP) and that of cyclophosphamide (CPM). However, dactinomycin, vinblastine, and vincristine did not appear to have a toxic effect on spermatogenesis. The prepubertal state did not protect the gonads of 19 patients who were prepubertal at diagnosis: 12 are now sterile as a result of the treatment. An increase in basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels gives a good indication of testicular damage, although normal levels do not rule out the possibility of azoospermia.\r"

  ".W": "Iodine deficiency is now recognized as a major international public health problem. It is estimated that 800 million people may be at risk of the effects of iodine deficiency. In humans, the effects occur at all stages of development: the fetus, the neonate, the child and adult. The effects are now denoted by the term iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). They include miscarriages, stillbirths, congenital anomalies, as well as the more familiar goiter, cretinism, impaired brain function, and hypothyroidism in children and adults. In domestic animals, reproductive failure has been reported with the production of aborted, stillborn and weak calves. Experimental studies in animal models have been reviewed to provide evidence of the mechanisms involved, particularly in relation to brain development. The findings in three different species (rat, sheep, monkey) indicate that the effects are mediated by a combination of maternal and fetal hypothyroidism, the effect of maternal hypothyroidism being earlier than the onset of fetal thyroid secretion. The findings suggest that iodine deficiency has an early effect on neuroblast multiplication and, if so, this could be important in the pathogenesis of the neurological form of endemic cretinism. The assessment of the full effects of iodine deficiency on the brain requires further studies in the postnatal period to determine the duration of these effects.\r"

  ".W": "Brush border membrane vesicles were isolated from mucosal homogenates of duodena from normal, rachitic and vitamin D-treated rachitic chicks using a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. In vitro uptake of 75Se-selenite by purified brush border membrane vesicles was studied using a rapid filtration technique. The time course of 75Se uptake was non-linear; rapid initial binding was followed by a gradual decrease in the rate of uptake until an equilibrium value was reached at 60-120 min. The initial binding at 36 s was not affected by selenite concentration in the incubation buffer, while the fractional rate of uptake between the 36 s and 2 min time periods was clearly lower with 1 mM Se than with 4-100 microM Se. 75Se uptake did not show any dependency on the external Na-gradient, nor could it be inhibited by other anions (arsenate, phosphate). Treatment of rachitic chicks either with cholecalciferol (500 Iu, 72 h) or with 1,25(OH)2-cholecalciferol (0.5 microgram given 16 h prior to isolation of the vesicles) significantly enhanced 75Se uptake. A threefold excess of mannitol in the outside buffer reduced 75Se uptake by vesicles from vitamin D-deficient and D-treated chicks 60% and 35% respectively, but had no effect on vesicles from vitamin D-treated chicks preloaded with 75Se. Neither saponin treatment nor excess cold selenite could release the label from the vesicles preloaded with 75Se. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that selenite easily crosses the brush border membrane into the intravesicular space and, once inside, is tightly bound by the membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A control group of rats was fed a diet containing 5% corn oil ad libitum. Four other groups were pair-fed to the controls; these rats were subjected to energy restriction of 10, 20, 30, or 40%. Weight gains among the groups were proportional to energy intake. The differences in weight were due primarily to reductions in body fat stores. Tumor incidence was reduced slightly by 20% calorie restriction and significantly by 30 and 40% restriction. There were also reductions in number of tumors per tumor-bearing rat and in mean tumor weight. The groups subjected to 30 and 40% energy restriction had significantly reduced serum levels of insulin in the fasting state. These data suggest that body weight, body fat, and fasting serum insulin correlate with susceptibility to mammary tumor promotion and that insulin may be a growth factor for DMBA-induced tumors.\r"

Twenty HIV antibody positive patients (10 with AIDS and 10 with ARC) were treated with sodium fusidate 500 mg every 8 h for up to 3 months. One patient died during therapy and six ceased treatment due to adverse events. Rash, nausea, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain caused difficulties in all patients.

In the differentiated U-937 cells, PAF induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and synthesis of inositol phosphates. PAF-induced production of inositol phosphates was rapid, concentration-dependent and was inhibited by a receptor antagonist CV3988, indicating that it was mediated via a specific receptor. In fura-2-loaded, differentiated U-937 cells, PAF induced immediate and concentration-dependent calcium mobilization [( Ca++]i) that was inhibited by CV3988, but not by calcium channel blockers. Addition of an increasing concentration of calcium chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, to the medium inhibited a large fraction (approximately 75%) of PAF receptor-induced [Ca++]i mobilization thus suggesting the majority of [Ca++]i mobilization was originated from extracellular milieu and a small portion (approximately 25%) was originated from intracellular sources. The inositol phosphate production induced by PAF, however, was independent from the extracellular calcium and was not inhibited by the addition of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Neither [Ca++]i mobilization or phosphoinositide metabolism in U-937 cells was sensitive to treatment of pertussis toxin, but both types of effects were sensitive to treatment by an inhibitor of phospholipase C, manoalide. These results suggest that in differentiated U-937 cells PAF receptor is coupled through a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein to a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C. Inositol-trisphosphate, and possibly diacylglycerol, could be the intracellular messengers for PAF receptor in U-937 cells.\r"

These data demonstrate that [3H]phosphatidyl choline is incorporated directly into a phospholipid pool that is accessible to some, but not all, hormonally stimulated lipases. In hearts labeled with 1-stearoyl,2-[3H]arachidonyl phosphatidyl choline, the radioactivity released by isoproterenol consisted of free fatty acid and lysophosphatidyl choline, indicating that isoproterenol stimulates both phospholipase(s) A1 and A2. Vasopressin and A23187 increased the release of free fatty acid, but not lysophosphatidyl choline, suggesting that these agents stimulate only phospholipase A2.\r"

In confirmation of reports using other neural tissues, activation of D-1 receptors with DA, apomorphine or SKF 38393 resulted in activation of adenylate cyclase and enhanced accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The response to DA was blocked by SCH 23390, a D-1 receptor antagonist. D-2 receptors negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase were demonstrated by preincubating retina with SCH 23390 and then with DA or apomorphine. D-2 receptor responses were also elicited with quinpirole or bromocriptine, D-2 receptor agonists, in the absence of SCH 23390. (+)-Butaclamol, but not (-)-butaclamol, blocked the D-2 receptor-induced decrease of cAMP. Moreover, I-sulpiride was more active than d-sulpiride in reversing the DA-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation. D-1 and D-2 receptor responses were also evident in forskolin-activated retina. The intraocular injection of pertussis toxin prevented the fall of cAMP and enhanced the rise of cAMP by DA, indirectly implicating the need for a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in the process. Our results demonstrate that retinal tissue contains DA receptors that are similar to those found in brain and they imply that therapeutic agents that interact with the receptors in brain might interact with the receptors in retina.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we have demonstrated that carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) in the inner medullary (IM) slices from the rabbit kidney. In order to localize the effects of carbachol in the IM, we measured PI hydrolysis in IM collecting duct (CD) cells which form approximately 50% of the IM and play an important role in determining the final composition of the urine. The IMCD cells were prepared from IM slices of the rabbit kidney by treatment with collagenase followed by addition of water to lyse the cells other than IMCD cells. To measure PI hydrolysis, the IMCD cells were incubated with [3H]inositol for its incorporation into PI before measurement of inositol phosphates (IP) released and accumulated in the presence of LiCl which prevents the dephosphorylation of IP. Carbachol (1 mM) produced greater than 16-fold increase in the release of IP (from 1.53 +/- 1.34% in control to 26.26 +/- 4.59% in drug-treated) in the isolated IMCD cells. The effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 (50% maximum effective concentration) of 4 microM carbachol. Carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis was blocked completely by 1 microM atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, and not by 1 microM hexamethonium, a nicotinic antagonist. The nicotinic agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (1 mM), had no significant effect on PI hydrolysis in the IMCD cells. We conclude that the stimulation of PI hydrolysis by cholinergic agents in the IMCD cells occurs through their interaction with muscarinic receptors and this process may play a role in the diuretic and natriuretic effects of these agents.\r"

The treatment of the brain cortical slices with veratrine for more than 10 min caused a significant decrease of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity. The similar inhibition of the enzyme by veratrine was observed in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and the veratrine treatment did not affect the sensitivity of the cortical enzyme for ouabain inhibition. These findings suggest that two isozymes of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase are equally inhibited by the treatment. Veratrine inhibited the partial reactions such as Na+-dependent phosphorylation and K+-stimulated phosphatase as well as the specific binding of [3H]ouabain. Agents which increase intracellular Na+ concentration also inhibited the enzyme activity. The effects of veratrine were blocked by Na+-free medium or tetrodotoxin. Low Na+ medium decreased the enzyme activity, and the effect was blocked by amiloride or Ca++-free medium, indicating the involvement of Na+/Ca++ exchange in the inhibition. The decreased activity induced by low Na+ or high K+ medium was restored to the normal level by the subsequent incubation in normal medium. The inhibitory effect of veratrine was dependent on external Ca++, and was blocked by addition of W-7 [N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide]. A23187 also decreased (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity in the slices. High Mg++ medium blocked the effect of veratrine but not that of monensin which was not dependent on external Ca++.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concentration-effect curves to vasodilators were completed concurrently in U46619-contracted bovine isolated coronary artery rings pre-exposed to 100 microM NTG for 10 min (NTG-tolerant rings) and in control rings not pre-exposed to NTG. Compared to control rings, NTG-tolerant rings were markedly less responsive (P less than .01, n = 8-10) to the spasmolytic actions of NTG, isosorbide dinitrate, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 3-morpholinosydonimine (SIN-1), whereas the spasmolytic actions of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and nitric oxide were only marginally attenuated in NTG-tolerant rings. On the other hand, no significant difference in the relaxant responses of NTG-tolerant and control coronary artery rings were observed to either the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, A23187 or the guanylate cyclase-independent vasodilator, theophylline. In additional cross-tolerance studies, relaxations to the organic nitrate vasodilator, NTG were significantly more attenuated (P less than .05, n = 5) by tolerance induced by NTG, than by either SNP or SIN-1, whereas the actions of the non-nitrate vasodilators, SNP and SIN-1 were attenuated more by SNP-and SIN-1-induced tolerance than by NTG-induced tolerance (P less than .05, n = 5). We conclude that, in this isolated coronary artery preparation, NTG-induced tolerance affects at least two major sites in the cascade of events between the initial site of NTG action and guanylate cyclase activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

AG-1749 inhibited both the (H+ + K+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity in canine gastric microsomes and dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated acid formation in isolated canine parietal cells and suppressed the acid secretion stimulated by histamine, pentagastrin, bethanechol or a peptone meal in Heidenhain pouch dogs; the ID50 values were between 0.2 and 0.7 mg/kg p.o. AG-1749 inhibited both the histamine-stimulated and the basal acid secretion in pylorusligated rats and prevented water immersion stress or aspirin-induced gastric lesions and mepirizole or cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers in rats; the ID50 values were between 0.3 to 3.6 mg/kg p.o. or i.d. Furthermore, AG-1749 prevented gastric lesions induced by absolute ethanol or acidified aspirin, and accelerated the healing of acetic acid-induced gastric or duodenal ulcers in rats. The inhibitory potency of AG-1749 in dogs was much the same as that of omeprazole and about half that of ranitidine. However, it was about 2 to 10 times more potent than omeprazole and 4 to 34 times more potent than ranitidine in rats. These results suggest that AG-1749 exerts prominent antiulcer activities mainly by suppressing acid secretion via an inhibition of a proton pump in gastric parietal cells and partly by protecting the gastrointestinal mucosa against various ulcerative stimuli.\r"

Sensitivity to GABA was analyzed by monitoring single unit responses to microiontophoretically applied GABA. The inverse agonist DMCM decreased GABA sensitivity of reticulata neurons to similar levels in control, chronic diazepam and acute diazepam-treated groups. Ro15-1788 administration reversed the effects of DMCM on GABA sensitivity and also resulted in comparable levels of GABA sensitivity in all treatment groups. Thus, the ability of the inverse agonist DMCM and the antagonist Ro15-1788 to alter GABA sensitivity of reticulata neurons was not altered by diazepam treatment. However, reticulata GABA sensitivity in the absence of additional benzodiazepine ligands was enhanced in both acute and chronic diazepam groups when compared to control values. The similarity in reticulata responses after both chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) diazepam treatments suggests that the enhanced sensitivity to GABA merely reflects the presence of diazepam. Thus, the ability of diazepam to potentiate reticulata GABA responses does not show time-dependent changes with prolonged benzodiazepine exposure.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) exposure to diazepam on firing rate responses of reticulata neurons to the inverse agonist methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788. The ability of DMCM and Ro15-1788 to alter firing rate were tested in control, chronic diazepam and acute diazepam-treated rats. In controls, DMCM increased firing rate of reticulata neurons. This effect was reversed by Ro15-1788, which had no effect on firing rate when administered alone. In acute and chronic diazepam-treated groups, low doses of DMCM were less effective in increasing firing than in controls. However, the administration of high doses of DMCM to diazepam-treated animals increased firing rates above the rates observed in control animals after the same compounds. Administration of Ro15-1788 also increased reticulata firing rates above control levels in both acute and chronic diazepam-treated groups. The similarity in reticulata responses after chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) diazepam treatments suggests that the altered properties of the benzodiazepine ligands observed after chronic exposure could reflect the presence of diazepam. This may indicate that reticulata neurons themselves do not show changes in sensitivity to benzodiazepine ligands after chronic benzodiazepine exposure. We propose that the altered responses to DMCM and Ro15-1788 in diazepam-treated rats reflect a compensatory change which occurs by 1 hr and maintains reticulata activity at a constant level throughout the period of prolonged exposure to the agonist.\r"

  ".W": "During azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic carcinogenesis in rats, biphasic induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity occurs in the colonic mucosa. The relative contributions of these two phases of ODC induction to the carcinogenesis process were examined by studying the effects of the specific ODC inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), administered during either the initial phase of ODC increase or during both phases continuously. The effects of 1% and 0.25% DFMO administered continuously were also compared. Continuous oral administration of DFMO at 1% (approximately 8 mg/g body wt/wk) and 0.25% (approximately 2 mg/g body wt/wk) produced 93% inhibition of ODC induction by AOM in the right and left colons throughout the study. Despite suppression of ODC activity to near-normal levels, colon tumor incidence at 26 weeks in the right colon was not affected by either initial-phase or continuous administration of DFMO. In contrast, tumor incidence in the left colon was reduced from 35% to 5% by DFMO given continuously at doses of both 1% and 0.25% over the entire 26 weeks (P less than .05). No significant reduction in left colon tumor incidence resulted from the short initial 11-week course of DFMO although the tumor incidence was reduced (15% vs. 35%). Results suggest that the second (\"post-initiation\") phase of ODC induction may be of particular importance in carcinogenesis.\r"

Patient groups were comparable statistically. In the group receiving additive hyaluronidase the percentage of tumor recurrences was decreased significantly (p less than 0.05). Side effects were not increased. Thus, adjuvant hyaluronidase appears to have a role in the metaphylaxis of bladder tumors. The potential reduction of the hyaluronidase dose without loss of protective action and the role of additive hyaluronidase in the systemic treatment of metastatic urothelial tumors remain to be investigated.\r"

Early i.m. growth induced urinary N1AS excretions up to tenfold normal, equivalent to a daily turnover of the entire tumor polyamine pool. N1AS excretion was correspondingly lower during more limited s.c. tumor growth. In nine other mouse tumors, N1AS pools were low or negligible, and correspondingly urinary N1AS or N8AS increased only in advanced growth, and less significantly. Urinary N1AS was elevated likewise in immature untumored mice. Thus, the enriched N1AS pool of the renal cell tumor was separately distinguishable as a direct source of elevation of urinary N1AS. N1AS was selectively abolished from the renal cell tumor by prolonged BCNU treatment, but was not rapidly depleted by the polyamine inhibitor DFMO. In cell culture, the RPMI renal cell tumor contained unusually high uninduced levels of sperm(id)ine N1-acetyltransferase, a potential source of N1AS. N1AS pools were also significantly elevated in human renal cell tumors.\r"

  ".W": "To identify microanatomic and chemical features that may mark the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid lesions, we evaluated 62 carotid artery bifurcation plaques including 45 high-grade stenoses removed at endarterectomy and 17 nonstenotic plaques recovered at autopsy. Morphologic features were evaluated on multiple-interval histologic sections and were graded for the presence of hemorrhage, ulceration, thrombosis, lumen surface irregularity, and calcification. Plaque hemorrhage, recent and remote, was found in most of the specimens, and did not discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic stenotic plaques. High-grade carotid stenotic plaques were associated with a significantly higher incidence of ulceration (53%), thrombosis (49%), and lumen irregularity (78%) when compared to nonstenotic asymptomatic plaques (6%, 0%, and 17%, respectively; p less than 0.01). Although these features were more prominent in lesions that produced symptoms, they were present in 80% of the stenotic bifurcations, and did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic endarterectomy plaques. No significant differences were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic high-grade lesions with respect to collagen, DNA, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, lipase, elastase, or collagenase content. We conclude that intraplaque hemorrhage is commonly seen in carotid plaques even without severe stenosis, and it does not appear to be a dominant determinant of symptoms. Ulceration and surface thrombi that may lead to cerebral embolization are prominent features in markedly stenotic plaques even when symptoms are absent. The disruptive processes that underlie plaque instability appear to be closely associated with plaque size and stenosis rather than plaque composition.\r"

  ".W": "Because it is postulated that compartment syndrome developing secondary to an acute arterial occlusion may be due to reperfusion injury, oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in its genesis. To assess the possible beneficial effect of free radical scavengers in this setting, we used a previously established in vivo canine model of compartment syndrome to compare four groups: group I, no treatment; group II, prophylactic fasciotomy; group III, intravenous albumin conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD); group IV, intravenous mannitol (hydroxyl radical scavenger). Both hind limbs were completely devascularized at the popliteal level except for an isolated pedicle to the anterior compartment. The right limb served as the nonischemic control, whereas the left underwent 8 hours of ischemia followed by reperfusion. Continuous monitoring of transfascial oxygen tension (tfPO2) demonstrated severe ischemia during occlusion (tfPO2 5.7 +/- 5.1 mm Hg) and restoration of blood flow with reperfusion (mean tfPO2 50 to 60 mm Hg). Measurements of compartment pressure were significantly higher after reperfusion in groups I, III, and IV when compared with those of group II (p less than 0.001, groups I and II; p less than 0.01, group IV). Extent of muscle necrosis assessed by technetium pyrophosphate scanning and expressed as a ratio of left to right legs was as follows: group I, 8.9 +/- 5.0; group II, 2.6 +/- 0.5; group III, 2.8 +/- 0.8; group IV, 1.8 +/- 0.6. Muscle contraction studies 16 hours after reperfusion indicated abnormal findings in all but group II. In conclusion, administration of free radical scavengers did not preserve normal neuromuscular function despite a significant reduction in muscle damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aneurysms of the abdominal aorta occur with atherosclerosis or connective tissue disorders. Changes of three components of aortic media, smooth muscle cells, elastin, and collagen, which could contribute to medial weakening, are discussed. Smooth muscle cells cultured from the aging abdominal aorta (normal, atherosclerotic, or aneurysmal) have limited replicative potential at five to six cell doublings, whereas cells from aneurysmal thoracic aorta undergo more than 20 cell doublings in culture. The elastin content is much reduced in aneurysms and this is associated with an increase in elastase activity of medial homogenates to 17.8 U/ng of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) compared with 8.3 and 4.4 U/ng of DNA in atherosclerotic and normal aorta, respectively. An elastinolytic enzyme has been purified from aneurysmal aorta and appears to have different properties from human leukocyte elastase. Ruptured aneurysms are associated with an increased total collagenase activity but the increase could be stimulated by, or result from, an influx of inflammatory cells and does not necessarily have a causal significance. In patients with a family history of aneurysm there appears to be a decreased content of type III collagen in aortic media: 24% +/- 4% compared with 32% +/- 5% in most aneurysms. Familial aneurysms are most common in women, and preliminary results suggest that a polymorphic variant of the type III collagen gene, defined by restriction enzyme digest, may be associated with aneurysmal disease in women. The genetic approach may define causal mechanisms predisposing patients to aneurysmal dilatation.\r"

Despite a number of early complications, the small intestine and liver developed near-normal function until a monoclonal, malignant, B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder appeared. The analysis of these two cases supports three summary observations: the operative procedure can be safely performed in a metabolically compromised infant; intestinal allograft rejection, in this model, is controllable with existing immunosuppressive drugs; and this procedure appears to be associated with a uniquely high incidence of lymphoma. Since transplantation is a feasible solution to this devastating infantile disease, further development of this therapy must incorporate means of preventing lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The pH, oxygen tension, and carbon dioxide tension of canine brain tissue were experimentally examined during profoundly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. After core cooling, a 60-minute period of circulatory arrest was performed in group 1 (n = 8), a 120-minute nonpulsatile low-flow perfusion (25 ml/kg/min) in group 2 (n = 8), and a 120-minute pulsatile low-flow perfusion (25 ml/kg/min) in group 3 (n = 8). When the animal was rewarmed, the core temperature was raised to 32 degrees C. Brain tissue pH kept decreasing in group 1, but it showed a delayed recovery in group 2 and a rapid recovery in group 3 during core rewarming. Brain tissue oxygen tension decreased significantly in group 1. Brain tissue carbon dioxide tension increased irreversibly in group 1, increased to about 100 mm Hg and recovered to 89.9 +/- 15.3 mm Hg in group 2, and reached a plateau of about 85 mm Hg and recovered to 55.4 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in group 3. We concluded that a 120-minute period of nonpulsatile low-flow perfusion provides more protection from brain damage than a 60-minute period of circulatory arrest. Furthermore, pulsatile flow will increase the safety margin of cardiopulmonary bypass even if the flow rate is reduced to 25 ml/kg/min.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolysis with pharmacologic agents is a valuable modality for treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The results of several clinical studies indicate that early recanalization can be elicited with intravenous agents and that it is associated with substantial reductions of infarct size, improvement of ventricular function, and reduction in mortality. The recently introduced fibrin-selective agent, rt-PA, appears to represent a significant pharmacologic advance. Its use intravenously elicits high recanalization rates without marked derangements of the coagulation system, reflecting its relative fibrin selectivity. The efficacy of thrombolysis with any drug given by any route, unfortunately, is not 100 per cent. Bleeding remains an important risk. The optimal approach to management of residual stenosis after thrombolysis has not yet been delineated. Currently available information appears to justify the following conclusions: 1. Transmural myocardial infarction usually is caused by an acute obstructing coronary thrombus superimposed on a chronic atherosclerotic lesion. Myocardial necrosis following interruption of blood flow generally is complete within several hours. 2. The thrombus can be lysed and blood flow can be restored with intravenous agents that activate plasminogen. Intravenous rt-PA, a relatively fibrin-specific agent, elicits recanalization in 70 to 75 per cent of infarct-related arteries. 3. Recombinant t-PA evokes only modest depletion of fibrinogen (16 to 36 per cent reduction from baseline). 4. Early reperfusion preserves myocardium and ventricular function and reduces mortality. 5. The extent of benefit after pharmacologic reperfusion is correlated strongly with the brevity of myocardial ischemia prior to initiation of therapy. The greatest benefit is realized in patients treated within the first few hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction. 6. The incidence and optimal means of prevention of reocclusion and reinfarction following successful pharmacologic reperfusion are not yet entirely clear. Mechanical recanalization with PTCA in conjunction with thrombolysis is promising, but its routine immediate use on an emergency basis does not appear to be beneficial. Vigorous educational efforts are needed to heighten the awareness of prospective patients and all members of the health care team to the value of prompt diagnosis of incipient or evolving infarction so that prompt implementation of thrombolysis in appropriate candidates can be facilitated.\r"

Three groups, matched for age and diabetes duration, were defined as: group I (n = 19), normal urinary albumin excretion (less than 30 mg/24 h); group II (n = 11), incipient diabetic nephropathy (30-300 mg albumin excreted per 24 h); and group III (n = 10), clinical diabetic nephropathy (more than 300 mg albumin excreted per 24 h). Nine non-diabetic men served as controls. The rise in tPA antigen with exercise was similar in the controls and group I but significantly smaller in groups II and III (p less than 0.01). The albumin transcapillary escape rate was significantly higher in groups II and III than in group I and normal controls (p less than 0.01). The basal plasma level of von Willebrand factor was higher in groups III (p less than 0.01) and II (difference not significant, p = 0.06) than in group I and normal controls. These findings suggest that insulin-dependent diabetic patients with only slightly raised urinary albumin excretion have general endothelial cell dysfunction or damage. It is not yet clear whether these changes are important in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and atherosclerosis in these patients.\r"

Of these patients, 1636 were then randomly assigned to treatment according to an invasive strategy consisting of coronary arteriography 18 to 48 hours after the administration of rt-PA, followed by prophylactic percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) if arteriography demonstrated suitable anatomy; 1626 patients were randomly assigned to treatment according to a conservative strategy, as part of which arteriography and PTCA were to be performed only in patients with spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia. In the group assigned to the invasive strategy, PTCA was attempted in 928 of the 1636 patients (56.7 percent); the procedure was anatomically successful in 93.3 percent. In the group assigned to the conservative strategy, 216 patients (13.3 percent) underwent clinically indicated PTCA within 14 days of the onset of symptoms. Reinfarction or death within 42 days, the primary end point, occurred in 10.9 percent of the group assigned to the invasive strategy and in 9.7 percent of those assigned to the conservative strategy (P not significant). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the ejection fraction at rest or during exercise, either at hospital discharge or six weeks after randomization. Eleven of 582 patients (1.9 percent) who received 150 mg of rt-PA and 15 of 2952 patients (0.5 percent) who received 100 mg of rt-PA had intracranial hemorrhage. A subgroup of 1390 patients who were eligible for short-term intravenous beta-blockade were randomly assigned to receive 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol immediately, followed by oral metoprolol, or oral metoprolol begun on day 6. The ejection fraction and the incidence of death in the two groups were similar during the hospital period. Total mortality within the first 6 days and at 42 days was also similar. However, in the group that received intravenous metoprolol, 16 patients had nonfatal reinfarctions and 107 patients had recurrent ischemic episodes by six days after entry into the study, as compared with 31 and 147 patients, respectively, among those randomly assigned to deferred oral beta-blockade (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively); the latter comparison was considered statistically significant according to the study criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is secreted by macrophages in response to inflammation, infection and cancer. Sublethal doses of recombinant TNF-alpha to rats causes cachexia, anaemia and inflammation. TNF-alpha plays a major part in tissue inflammation and remodelling by stimulating production of collagenase. Cellular responses to TNF-alpha are initiated by binding to high-affinity cell surface receptors. TNF-alpha then profoundly affects gene regulation, stimulating the fos, myc, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 genes and inhibiting the type I collagen gene. Here we demonstrate that TNF-alpha also stimulates collagenase gene transcription; this stimulation is mediated by an element of the gene that is responsive to the transcription factor AP-1, the major component of which (jun/AP-1) is encoded by the jun gene; and that TNF-alpha stimulates prolonged activation of jun gene expression. This prolonged induction of jun contrasts with its transient activation by the phorbol ester TPA and provides a physiological example of the ability of jun/AP-1 to stimulate its own transcription. This may be a key mechanism for mediating at least some of the biological effects of TNF-alpha.\r"

One of these Drosophila homoeobox-containing proteins is encoded by the fushi tarazu (ftz) gene. The expression of ftz is spatially restricted during embryogenesis and the ftz polypeptide has an important role in different stages of development. To determine whether the ftz polypeptide is a sequence-specific DNA-binding activator of transcription, we expressed portions of ftz as fusions with the yeast transcription factor GAL4 in yeast cells. Chimaeric GAL4/ftz proteins, like GAL4 itself, activated the transcription of a GAL4-dependent reporter gene. With reporter constructs containing Drosophila-derived chromosomal DNA sequences as transcriptional elements, the ftz polypeptide acted as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional activator. In Drosophila, the ftz product may therefore be a positive regulator of transcription.\r"

The ninaA gene was isolated and found to encode a 237-amino-acid protein that has over 40% amino-acid sequence identity with the vertebrate cyclosporin A-binding protein, cyclophilin, a protein that seems to be involved in T-lymphocyte activation. The remarkable evolutionary conservation of cyclophilin in two phylogenetically distant organisms and its involvement in diverse transduction processes suggests that this protein plays an important role in cellular metabolism. Indeed, cyclophilin has recently been shown to be a prolyl cis-trans isomerase that catalyses, in vitro, rate-limiting steps in the folding of a number of proteins. Here, we present evidence for the involvement of cyclophilin-like molecules in a defined cellular process. The availability of mutations in a cyclophilin gene provides a new model system for the study of cyclophilin and cyclosporin action.\r"

  ".W": "The diversification of the repertoire of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) specificities is influenced by at least two selection processes which occur in the thymus. One of these, termed 'negative selection', is required to install a state of tolerance to self-antigens in the T-cell repertoire and is often achieved by clonal deletion. The second type of selection operating in the thymus results in preferential differentiation of T cells that have restriction specificity for thymic major histocompatibility complex glycoproteins, but the mechanisms leading to this selective process are not yet clear. One model used to describe this 'positive selection' proposes that only those T cells with sufficient avidity for the MHC glycoproteins expressed in the thymus are allowed to acquire functional competence. Here we directly investigate the generation of TCR specificities by following the fate of developing V beta 17+ CD4-CD8+ T cells under conditions where one of the main class I-MHC molecules, either H-2K or H-2D, was specifically blocked by in vitro monoclonal antibody treatment. The results show that development of V beta 17+ CD4-CD8+ T cells in the SJL H-2s mouse strain is selectively abrogated by blocking class I-Ks molecules but is unaffected by blocking class I-Ds molecules. These data directly demonstrate that generation of CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing a particular TCR V beta segment can be correlated with the expression of a particular class I-MHC molecule, thereby providing evidence for positive selection.\r"

One of the earliest events following binding of ANP to receptors on target cells is an increase in cyclic GMP concentration, indicating that this nucleotide might act as a mediator of the physiological effects of the hormone. Guanylate cyclase exists in at least two different molecular forms: a soluble haem-containing enzyme consisting of two subunits and a non-haem-containing transmembrane protein having a single subunit. It is the membrane form of guanylate cyclase that is activated following binding of ANP to target cells. We report here the isolation, sequence and expression of a complementary DNA clone encoding the membrane form of guanylate cyclase from rat brain. Transfection of this cDNA into cultured mammalian cells results in expression of guanylate cyclase activity and ANP-binding activity. The ANP receptor/guanylate cyclase represents a new class of mammalian cell-surface receptors which contain an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular guanylate cyclase catalytic domain.\r"

The active molecules are cleaved from the C termini of precursors. TGF-beta 1, like other forms of TGF-beta, is synthesized and secreted in a latent high relative molecular mass form (L-TGF-beta 1) from which active TGF-beta 1 can be released by transient and probably unphysiological acidification. The latent complex from human platelets contains one dimeric TGF-beta 1 molecules, which is noncovalently associated with a disulphide-bonded complex of one dimeric remnant of the precursor and a single molecule of the so-called TGF-beta 1 binding protein (TGF-beta 1-BP). We report here that enzymatic removal in vitro of the carbohydrate structures in the remnant of the TGF-beta 1 precursor produces biologically active TGF-beta 1 from the latent complex, suggesting that carbohydrate structures are of importance in rendering TGF-beta 1 inactive in the complex in vivo.\r"

This simple view has, however, recently been questioned. To test this hypothesis directly, we microinjected individual smooth muscle cells with modulators of the MLCK pathway while measuring contraction and calcium-ion concentration. Injection of a constitutively active proteolyzed form of MLCK causes contraction but no change in calcium concentration. By contrast, injection of peptide inhibitors of MLCK blocks contraction in response to K+ depolarization, despite the fact that the change in calcium concentration in response to stimulation was enhanced over controls. These results provide a direct demonstration at the level of a single cell that activation of the calmodulin-MLCK pathway is both necessary and sufficient to trigger contraction of smooth muscle.\r"

Determinations of spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were made by labelled microspheres prior to and during compression, and then 1/2, 1 1/2, and 2 1/2 hours after compression. Twelve control animals received saline (80 ml/h). Nine animals received hetastarch (a 20 ml/kg bolus followed by an 80 ml/h infusion) and 8 animals received mannitol (a 1 g/kg bolus followed by 1 g/kg/hr). An additional 10 animals received phenylephrine to raise mean arterial pressure by 20 to 40%. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded following each determination of SCBF. Animals were killed following determination of the 2 1/2 hour postcompressive flow. The animals treated with either hetastarch or phenylephrine had a postcompressive mean arterial pressure that was significantly greater than that of the controls (P less than 0.01). During treatment, cardiac output in the hetastarch and mannitol animals was significantly greater and hematocrit significantly less than in the controls (P less than 0.05). In spite of these changes, postcompressive SCBF was significantly increased only in those animals treated with phenylephrine (P less than 0.05). Statistical analysis of the relationship between mean arterial pressure and postcompressive SCBF revealed that autoregulation is indeed lost with this experimental model of spinal cord injury. Histological examination of the injured site failed to demonstrate any difference in the area of hemorrhagic necrosis among the four groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of 7, 12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogen, on pathologic changes in buccal pouch mucosa of hamsters with latent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections in their trigeminal ganglia. Of the pouches receiving DMBA treatment, the average number of tumors per pouch was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in pouches of animals with HSV-1 infections as compared to those that received DMBA only. Of the pouches receiving DMBA, the average cumulative tumor diameter (the sum of the tumor diameters in each group divided by the number of pouches in that group) was notably greater in animals with latent HSV-1 than in animals that had not been infected; however, this difference was not significant. The DMBA-treated hamsters that had latent infections also displayed a higher severity and prevalence of histopathologic changes in their pouch mucosa. This study indicates that latent HSV-1 and DMBA show synergism in the development of tumors and precancerous histopathologic changes in hamster buccal pouch mucosa. An unexpected finding was that among the HSV-1 infected animals, 95% of the ganglia from animals treated with DMBA showed latent HSV-1 virus on explanation culture, whereas only 10% of the ganglia from infected animals that received mineral oil, rather than DMBA, contained latent virus.\r"

  ".W": "The opaque-2 gene was shown years ago to increase the nitrogen, lysine, and tryptophan contents of maize and to markedly increase its nutritional value for small children. Concerns about decreased yield, resistance, and acceptability discouraged further development of the gene. Quality protein maize, while retaining the opaque-2 characteristics, has overcome those constraints. Six recovering malnourished infants received diets in which all of the 6.4% protein energy was supplied by casein, quality protein maize, or common maize. The quality protein maize supplied 60% and common maize 75% of total energy. Vegetable oil was added to increase fat contents to 10% of total energy in all diets. Energy digestibility was less (87% and 84%) from quality protein maize and common maize than from casein diets (94%); most of the difference was due to carbohydrate digestibility. Apparent N absorptions from quality protein maize (70 +/- 5%) and common maize (69% +/- 7%) were much lower (P less than .01) than from casein (82% +/- 4%). Apparent retention of N from quality protein maize (34 +/- 4%) was less (P less than .01) than from casein (41% +/- 9%) but greater (P less than .01) than from common maize (22% +/- 10%). Breath hydrogen excretions were usually greater during quality protein maize consumption than during casein diets but not nearly as much as those during common maize diets. The nutritional advantages of quality protein maize v common maize are of a magnitude that must be exploited for the advantage of children in maize-consuming poor countries.\r"

  ".W": "Growth hormone (GH) is required for the terminal differentiation of preadipose Ob1771 cells that have entered the differentiation program as evidenced by the expression of early marker genes (pOb24 and lipoprotein lipase). Induction of c-fos mRNA within 15 min and induction of insulin-like growth factor I mRNA within a few hours take place in response to GH. The role of GH is mediated, at least in part, by means of the activation of protein kinase C, as shown by the inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding and by the expression of the c-fos gene, and is thus analogous to the action of prostaglandin F2 alpha and 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate in this respect. However, in contrast to that of the c-fos gene, the regulation of insulin-like growth factor I gene expression by GH is not mediated by means of the activation of protein kinase C, and, in line with this, prostaglandin F2 alpha and 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate were ineffective. GH and prostaglandin F2 alpha were able to stimulate the formation of diacyglycerol within a few seconds, but GH did not elicit an accumulation of inositol phosphates, in contrast to that generated by prostaglandin F2 alpha. We conclude that the transduction signal of GH action in c-fos mRNA induction is the formation of diacylglycerol and that the mechanism whereby GH can activate protein kinase C is associated with a phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids other than inositol phospholipids.\r"

By subtractive and differential screening, we have cloned 12 of these sequences, 2 of which were c-fos and krox-24. Serum induced all the v-src-inducible genes tested, suggesting that these genes serve roles in normal cell division and are not specific to transformation per se. Significantly, however, v-src produced prolonged, and in some cases kinetically complex, patterns of induction compared to serum. For most of the clones, phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate (TPA) induced mRNAs with kinetics similar to that of serum. However, one clone (CEF-4) was expressed in a biphasic manner. Another (CEF-10) was repressed by TPA at 1 hr, after which this mRNA was permanently induced. The pattern of repression-induction of CEF-10 mRNA is the inverse of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the cell, suggesting that PKC actively represses this gene. In vivo expression of CEF-10 mRNA is restricted predominantly to the lung. A full-length CEF-10 cDNA encodes a 41-kDa protein that has an amino-terminal signal peptide for secretion, contains a markedly high number of cysteine residues, and shows no sequence similarity to known proteins.\r"

To determine whether this region of the SSU of higher plants has a specific function, portions of the SSU genes (rbcS) of pea (Pisum sativum) and the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans were fused to create chimeric genes that either lacked or contained the coding sequence for the 16 conserved amino acids. Precursor proteins synthesized in vitro from the chimeric genes were incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts to assay import and assembly into the holoenzyme. Fusion proteins lacking the 16-amino acid sequence were imported and processed but failed to assemble with endogenous large subunit. Addition of the region from a pea rbcS containing the 16 amino acids to the rbcS of Anacystis enabled the imported SSU fusion protein to assemble with pea large subunit. This 16-amino acid sequence is encoded by a separate exon in certain rbcS genes of higher plants. We propose that the conserved 16-amino acid sequence constitutes a domain acquired to facilitate assembly of the eukaryotic holoenzyme.\r"

Results presented demonstrate overexpression of c-Ha-ras gene at a very early stage of tumor development, and this elevated level of expression of the gene persists throughout the tumorigenesis process. The expression of the cellular protooncogene c-erbB, on the other hand, can be detected only after 8-10 weeks of DMBA treatment of the tissue and increases with the progression of the disease. The overexpression of c-erbB gene can be correlated with the stage of extensive proliferation and subsequent invasion of the HBPE cells into the underlying connective tissue. This sequential pattern of stage-specific expression of the two cellular protooncogenes can be observed in (i) treated tissues, (ii) stage-representative cultured cells, and (iii) NIH 3T3 transformants derived with DNA from HBPE cells. The low-level expression of c-myc and c-sis genes detected in control tissues remains unaffected, while c-fos gene activity cannot be detected at any stage of tumor development. The overexpression of c-Ha-ras gene alone in HBPE cells derived from tissues treated for 5 weeks (DM5) is not sufficient to induce tumors in athymic mice, whereas expression of c-Ha-ras and c-erbB genes at later stages of tumor development (DM10 and HCPC cells) induce histopathologically defined epithelial cell carcinoma in athymic mice within 2-3 weeks. The sequential overexpression of c-Ha-ras and c-erbB genes in a stage-specific manner and their cooperative interaction in the DMBA-induced in vivo oral carcinogenesis have been demonstrated.\r"

A JH-like molecule is secreted that comigrates with a synthetic sample of methyl 6,7;10,11-bisepoxy-3,7,11-trimethyl-(2E)-dodecenoate (JHB3) during TLC, liquid chromatography, and GC analysis. Purified product from farnesoic acid-stimulated ring glands was analyzed by electron impact GC/MS and gave a mass spectrum identical to synthetic JHB3. Additional structure confirmation was obtained following conversion of product from unstimulated biosynthesis to a derivative that comigrated on liquid chromatography with the derivative prepared from synthetic JHB3. Physiological studies revealed that JHB3 is produced solely by the corpus allatum portion of the ring gland in vitro. Isolated ring glands from other cyclorrhaphous dipteran larvae also produce JHB3 almost exclusively in vitro. Corpora allata from mosquito larvae, however, produce only JH III, indicating that JHB3 production may be restricted to the higher Diptera. Topically applied synthetic JHB3 caused developmental responses in newly formed D. melanogaster white puparia similar to those obtained with JH III. The data suggest that JHB3 is a fly juvenile hormone.\r"

The sequences of 13 isolates of the Est6 gene covering all 10 allozymes were obtained and 52 nucleotide differences were found. Sixteen of these cause amino acid replacements, of which three result in charge differences whose size and direction are consistent with the electrophoretic mobilities of the allozymes in which they occur. The smeared electrophoretic phenotype of one allozyme can be explained by the loss of a cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bridge. Several minor mobility variants within the major F and S electrophoretic phenotypes differ by amino acid substitutions that are generally conservative for charge but not for some other properties (size, polarity, or hydrophobicity). Four amino acid differences are found among different isolates of the same allozymes and, overall, 12 amino acid haplotypes occur among the 13 isolates sequenced. Nevertheless, the most common variants within F and S are distinguished by only two amino acids (Asn/Asp at 237 and Thr/Ala at 247), and these are the most likely targets for the selection underlying complementary latitudinal clines in F and S frequencies.\r"

One significant concern involves the rotary vane aspirators used to provide the suction required for the procedure. A series of experiments was carried out to determine whether aerosols are produced during the use of a rotary vane aspirator, since aerosols are known to be hazardous under appropriate conditions. Using a viable strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we challenged the system through the suction port, and the exhaust from the aspirator was then cultured in a particle sampler. Results indicate that viable pathogens are released from the exhaust in physiologically significant particles capable of penetrating to the level of the alveolus in the normal human lung. These infectious particles were produced for 3 hours after the initial challenge. When an appropriate filtration device was attached to the aspirator outflow, the aspirator pump and environment were protected. In the absence of an appropriate filtration device, the aerosolized particles may constitute a hazard to patients or medical workers in the vicinity of the aspirator.\r"

  ".W": "Specification of cell fate in the compound eye of Drosophila appears to be controlled entirely by cell interactions. The sevenless gene is required for the correct determination of one of the eight photoreceptor cells (R7) in each ommatidium. It encodes a transmembrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain and is expressed transiently on a subpopulation of ommatidial precursor cells including the R7 precursors. It is shown here that heat shock-induced indiscriminate expression of a sevenless complementary DNA throughout development can correctly specify R7 cell identity without affecting the development of other cells. Furthermore, discontinuous supply of sevenless protein during eye development leads to the formation of mosaic eyes containing stripes of sevenless+ and sevenless- ommatidia, suggesting that R7 cell fate can be specified only within a relatively short period during ommatidial assembly. These results support the hypothesis that the specification of cell fate by position depends on the interaction of a localized signal with a receptor present on many undifferentiated cells, and that the mere presence of the receptor alone is not sufficient to specify cell fate.\r"

This suggests the presence of a family of Shaker-like genes in Drosophila. By using a Shaker complementary DNA probe and low-stringency hybridization, three additional family members have now been isolated, Shab, Shaw, and Shal. The Shaker family genes are not clustered in the genome. The deduced proteins of Shab, Shaw, and Shal have high homology to the Shaker protein; the sequence identity of the integral membrane portions is greater than 50 percent. These genes are organized similarly to Shaker in that only a single homology domain containing six presumed membrane-spanning segments common to all voltage-gated ion channels is coded by each messenger RNA. Thus, potassium channel diversity could result from an extended gene family, as well as from alternate splicing of the Shaker primary transcript.\r"

The quantities of D epitopes on such RBCs have been measured previously in one kindred. The authors report on the number of D epitopes on Du RBCs of 23 unrelated individuals, as calculated by Scatchard's analysis. Cell-bound anti-D was measured by an automated antiglobulin consumption technique. On the average, RBCs of the Rh phenotype CcDue had a mean of 1568 +/-1220 (n = 12) D epitopes per cell. The relatively large range of values in this group implies a heterogeneous genetic background. The lowest number of D epitopes, 285 per cell, was observed on the RBCs of one individual who was apparently homozygous for C. In this case, the D antigen was detected only by adsorption/elution tests. RBCs of the phenotype cDuEe had a mean of 775 +/- 378 epitopes per cell (n = 8), and those from two individuals with phenotype cDue had 2840 and 1560 D epitopes, respectively. Thus, on the average, RBCs with the Du phenotype bear about 10 to 20 times less D antigen than normal Rh-positive RBCs. It is suggested that the low D antigen density of Du red cells may account for their poor immunogenicity.\r"

  ".W": "To select the most promising 111In chelate for use as a second red cell (RBC) label for comparison of the survival of autologous and allogeneic cells, 49 normal RBC samples were studied in vitro after being labeled with 111In-8-hydroxyquinolinol (111In-oxine) prepared by three different methods, 111In-tropolone, and 111In-acetylacetone. Labeling efficiencies reached 99 percent and did not decline when the amount of 111In used was increased from 1.75 to 50 muCi per ml of RBCs. Storage of labeled RBCs in normal AB plasma at 4, 22, and 37 degrees C for up to 48 hours resulted in a similar rate of loss of the label from the RBCs with all labeling methods. These rates were time- and temperature-dependent and were accurate predictions of the rates found in later in vivo experimentation. Fresh RBCs from 11 subjects were labeled with 111In chelated with oxine in the presence of the RBCs or chelated with tropolone just prior to the labeling. RBC mass determinations using these autologous RBCs labeled with 111In accurately reflected the subjects' RBC masses as predicted through standard morphometric formulae. The rate of disappearance of the radionuclide after reinfusion of the autologous RBCs decreased with time. At 24 hours after reinfusion, 89.5 +/- 1.29 percent (mean +/- SEM) of the 111In-tropolone and 87.3 +/- 1.25 percent of the 111In-oxine continued in circulation. 111In is a simple and efficient agent for the labeling of RBCs for blood volume determinations and short-term survivals.\r"

  ".W": "Automated plasmapheresis devices are being integrated into many modern plasma procurement programs. Owing to the use of a different concentration and type of anticoagulant, the recovered plasma differs in pH and citrate levels from that obtained by manual plasmapheresis or whole blood donation. Recently, fractionators noted the recovery of a sticky, gelatinous fraction (cryogel) during thawing of cell-free (CF) plasma, along with reduced recovery of factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) in the cryoprecipitate fraction. Following their manufacturing procedures, it was established that the cryogel fraction of CF plasma is enriched in FVIII:C, fibrinogen, and fibronectin, as compared to cryoprecipitate from CPDA-1 plasma. Cryogel formation was not significantly affected by pH or citrate adjustment of the recovered plasma, by the use of polycarbonate or nylon filter membranes, or by the filter wetting agent polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Furthermore, passage of CPDA-1 plasma through the polycarbonate filter did not alter cryoprecipitate quality. However, cryogel formation from CF plasma was reduced significantly by 1) slow thawing at 4 degrees C rather than quick thawing at 20 and 0 or 20 and 4 degrees C, 2) the use of 1:16.6 sodium citrate rather than 1:12.5 ACD-A, or 3) the addition of intact platelets, platelet lysate, membranes, or cytosol to CF plasma before freezing. The data suggest an important and, indeed, essential role of platelet constituents in the formation of both cryoprecipitate and cryogel during the low-temperature purification of plasma proteins.\r"

We have found that 76 percent of patients experienced postorchiectomy flushes, and 30 percent believed their symptoms warranted treatment. The flushing started at between one and twelve months (average 2.7 months) postoperatively and lasted an average of thirty months or, in some cases, up to the time of death (average 33 months). No single precipitating factor was found, and no single hormone seemed to be responsible. Special attention was given to the nonflushers to see whether or not it was of prognostic significance, and it appears that the slight elevation in the testosterone level sufficient to prevent flushing may indicate a nontesticular source of androgen. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera), 5 mg twice daily, appeared to be an effective agent for controlling the flushes.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test whether hypoxia caused simultaneous stimulation of sympathetic and vagal cardiac nerves. To do this, we determined in chloralose-anesthetized, open-chest dogs, changes in sinus cycle length (SCL), atrioventricular nodal conduction time (AH interval), and effective refractory periods (ERP) of the right atrium (RA) and left ventricle (LV) during hypoxia induced by either hypoventilation or by breathing 10% oxygen in nitrogen. We found that hypoventilation decreased arterial pH (mean +/- SE: 7.365 +/- 0.011 versus 7.244 +/- 0.013, p less than 0.001) and Po2 (105.2 +/- 3.6 versus 50.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), and increased Pco2 (24.4 +/- 0.7 versus 41.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). SCL (373 +/- 19 versus 485 +/- 35 msec, p less than 0.001), AH interval (92 +/- 4 versus 111 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.005), and LVERP (159.8 +/- 3.2 versus 162.0 +/- 3.3, p less than 0.05) lengthened, while RAERP shortened (137.7 +/- 2.6 versus 128.8 +/- 3.5, p less than 0.001). After bilateral vagotomy, these electrophysiologic changes were attenuated, and transection of ansae subclaviae following vagotomy did not affect hypoventilation-induced changes that were present after vagotomy alone. In contrast, breathing 10% oxygen decreased Po2 (104.2 +/- 3.3 versus 48.1 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.001) but did not change pH and Pco2. SCL lengthened slightly (444 +/- 15 versus 463 +/- 17, p less than 0.001), but other measured electrophysiologic parameters were not affected. The norepinephrine concentration in the coronary sinus blood increased by 109% to 121% during hypoxia induced by both methods. Hypoventilatory hypoxia blunted sympathetic-induced shortening of LVERP and potentiated vagally-induced SCL lengthening. Neither type of hypoxia affected induction of atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation. We conclude that the electrophysiologic response during hypoventilatory hypoxia is due primarily to heightened vagal tone. Norepinephrine concentration in the coronary sinus blood more than doubled, but did not alter cardiac electrophysiologic properties, possibly because of simultaneous increase in vagal tone, or possibly due to the release of adenosine or other factors that impaired cardiac electrophysiologic response to elevated norepinephrine levels.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP), hemodynamic parameters, and plasma catecholamines and, in addition, to determine whether circulating ANP is metabolized in the pulmonary circulation, plasma concentrations of ANP were determined in 40 patients with chronic left-sided heart failure. After at least 30 minutes of bed rest with the patient in the supine position, blood samples were drawn simultaneously from both the main pulmonary artery (mPA) and the ascending aorta (Ao) before administration of contrast medium. The plasma ANP concentrations significantly decreased from the mPA to the Ao (135.3 +/- 18.1 pg/ml vs 127.4 +/- 19.4 pg/ml; mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). The plasma ANP level in the mPA correlated with the plasma norepinephrine level in the Ao (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01), right atrial pressure (r = 0.34, p less than 0.05), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.829, p less than 0.001), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Of the various hemodynamic parameters and plasma catecholamine concentrations in the Ao, only LVEDP was found to be an independent and significant predictor of plasma ANP levels in the mPA. These results indicate that ANP released from the heart is regulated mainly by preload (LVEDP) in cases of left-sided heart failure and that circulating ANP is metabolized in the pulmonary circulation. In conclusion, the plasma ANP concentration may be a useful noninvasive index of LVEDP in patients with chronic left-sided heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Before commencing the randomized Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction phase II (TIMI II) study, 370 patients were administered intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and assigned to 2-hour (immediate) percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 33), 18- to 48-hour (delayed) angioplasty (n = 288) or no angioplasty (n = 49) in a nonrandomized, observational pilot study. Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and during exercise was assessed by gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography at hospital discharge and again at 6 weeks. At hospital discharge, ejection fraction averaged 50% at rest and 56% at peak exercise. At 6-week follow-up, ejection fraction averaged 50% at rest and 53% at peak exercise. At 6-week follow-up, resting ejection fraction average 49% in the 2-hour angioplasty group, 49% in the 18- to 48-hour angioplasty group and 55% in the no-angioplasty group. Variables independently predicting \"good functional outcome\" at 6-week follow-up (survival with resting ejection fraction greater than equal to 50% and no decrease with exercise) in the 18- to 48-hour angioplasty group were fewer leads with ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 0.1 mV, younger age, rapid normalization during rt-PA infusion of ST segments or dramatic relief of chest pain, absence of arrhythmias within the first 24 hours of treatment initiation, no prior infarction and not a cigarette smoker at entry. Thus, the TIMI II pilot study demonstrates that most patients with AMI of less than or equal to 4-hour duration treated with rt-PA have good ventricular function after AMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The quality of life is similar for successful transplant and home hemodialysis patients; these patients appear to fare better than other treatment groups on both objective and subjective measures. Patients receiving staff-assisted center hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) report markedly diminished quality of life; these decrements remained after statistically controlling for nontreatment variables. Diminished quality of life was most pronounced in dialysis patients who had experienced failed transplants. All treatment groups showed some objective losses, especially loss of employment, but patients in the best rehabilitated treatment groups showed near-normal subjective quality of life. The results confirm previous reports that the subjective quality of life of ESRD patients can be nearly normal despite objective losses, but demonstrate that inadequate definition of treatment groups has led to misperceptions about the impact of transplant failure.\r"

This study compared performing endocervical cultures in all women seeking routine gynecologic care to a no-test strategy. Estimates derived from the medical literature were varied in a sensitivity analysis, and a Monte Carlo technique was used to incorporate the estimates of experts into the analysis. RESULTS: We found that routinely testing for gonorrhea reduced overall medical costs when the prevalence of infection exceeded 1.5 percent. This result was most sensitive to variation in the cost of the culture and the assumption that treatment prevents adverse sequelae. Reducing the estimated cost of the culture from $9 to $5 decreased the threshold prevalence from 1.5 to 0.8 percent. When we considered the variation in estimates of experts, the threshold prevalence increased from 1.5 to 2.1 percent. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a strategy of testing and treating selected women with risk factors for gonorrhea will not only reduce the likelihood of the development of serious adverse sequelae but will also result in a reduction of medical costs.\r"

  ".W": "The association between glomerular disease and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is well documented in reports from South America. During the present hospital investigation in Sudan, 58 patients admitted for intercurrent complications of advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis were studied. The patients, median age 35 years, had no concurrent Schistosoma haematobium infection. Diagnostic criteria included an enlarged spleen (n = 58), at least 1 episode of hematemesis (n = 55) and/or melena (n = 36), endoscopical demonstration of gastroesophageal varices (29/29 studied), ultrasonographical imaging of hepatic periportal fibrosis (18/18 studied), and intraoperative liver biopsy with characteristic histological findings (11/16 biopsied). Serum creatinine, urea, electrolytes, cholesterol, total protein, and electrophoresis were within normal limits. Median urinary protein/creatinine ratio was 0.06 and thereby not significantly different from European reference values. Only 1 patient had proteinuria of 1.7 g/l. Minimal hematuria was found in 5 patients. Ten kidney biopsies were taken intraoperatively during a portal decompression procedure (Hassab operation). Light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy produced no evidence of glomerulonephritis. These findings indicate that S. mansoni induced nephrotic syndrome may be less frequent in Sudan than in South America. Renal involvement due to S. mansoni infection may therefore encompass geographical variances.\r"

  ".U": "89148564\r", 
  ".W": "Peritoneal exudate cells from mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni (S-PEC) can kill a small proportion of schistosomula in vitro in the presence of immune serum. S-PEC produce a low level of respiratory burst. However, schistosomula mortality in their presence is not reduced when exogenous antioxidants are added, suggesting that with S-PEC, oxidative killing may not be important. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide production by S-PEC, and cells from Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and thioglycollate (THGL) injected mice, nonspecifically stimulated with opsonized zymosan, were measured. Levels of H2O2 produced by S-PEC were significantly lower than BCG or THGL PEC, and were below the threshold for schistosomula killing. This correlated with lower levels of cell-mediated killing of schistosomula in vitro by S-PEC than by BCG-PEC. Superoxide levels, however, were similar between the 3 cell populations. It therefore appears that the efficiency of PEC to kill schistosomules in vitro correlates with H2O2 rather than superoxide levels. It was found that there was a sharp concentration threshold in H2O2 mediated killing of schistosomula. A depression in the levels of H2O2 produced may be a mechanism by which the parasite can partially evade the host immune system.\r"

Each patient had achalasia with symptoms extending from 4 to 25 years. Diverticulectomy and esophagomyotomy were performed in every patient. One patient had previously undergone diverticulectomy alone, with prompt recurrence of the lesion. During a follow-up period extending from 2 to 10 years, three patients were alive and well. One patient developed recurrent dysphagia due to reflux esophagitis and stricture requiring dilatation. It is essential that esophagomyotomy be part of the initial operative procedure.

Duration of analgesia (mean +/- SD) was 24.3 +/- 9.4 hours after the epidural injection of hydromorphone plus epinephrine. This was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than the duration of 18.2 +/- 5.9 hours after the same dose of plain hydromorphone. Analgesia was more rapid in onset and significantly better at the 0.5, 1, 3, and 12 hours postoperatively in the hydromorphone-epinephrine group. Side effects including pruritus (73%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (15%) were of similar frequency with and without epinephrine. Although mean venous PCO2 (PvCO2) levels three and six hours after the hydromorphone-epinephrine dose were elevated significantly over the pre-drug PvCO2 levels, no respiratory depression was detected by an apnea monitor to which all patients were connected. The addition of epinephrine to epidural hydromorphone hastened onset and prolonged the duration of analgesia after cesarean section.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to examine the hypothesis that intravenous anesthetic induction agents alter neuroregulation of the cardiovascular system. Additional goals were to investigate this in an animal model devoid of other drug effects. Healthy mongrel dogs had arterial catheters inserted and pneumatic occluders positioned around the thoracic aorta and inferior vena cava. After 10 to 14 days of recovery, neurocirculatory control mechanisms were assessed in the absence of anesthesia by recording changes in the RR interval of the electrocardiogram in response to alterations in systolic arterial pressure. Systolic pressure was manipulated over a range of 65 to 200 mm Hg by random occlusion of either the inferior vena cava (hypotension) or aortic (hypertension) occluders. The animals were then given bolus doses of either thiopental (20 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg), ketamine (5 mg/kg), or etomidate (1.2 mg/kg) on separate days and in random order. The arterial pressure alterations were repeated 3, 10, and 20 minutes after the drugs were given. Regression curves were calculated expressing the slope relation between RR interval and systolic pressure at awake control and each time point after drug administration. The responses were compared with control by repeat measures analysis of variance. Thiopental significantly decreased this slope relation for 10 minutes. Diazepam decreased this slope at 3 minutes only. Ketamine, like thiopental, decreased this slope for 10 minutes. Following etomidate, the slopes were similar to control. We conclude that thiopental, diazepam, and ketamine impair neurocirculatory control capabilities. The effect of diazepam is only transient, whereas that of thiopental and ketamine is longer, and etomidate does not affect these reflexes.\r"

Animals were exposed to increasing or decreasing levels of halothane. After equilibration at each concentration, the response to tail-clamping was used for MAC testing. MAC was reduced approximately 17% in aged (25 months) versus young adult (5 months) animals. From these data, it is concluded that the F-344 rat may be an adequate model for examination of age-dependent alterations in the actions of volatile anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To predict the effects of using exercise testing to screen healthy persons for coronary artery disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: The publications of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study were the principal sources of data for the cost-effectiveness analysis; we also used data from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study of stable angina and the publications of the European Coronary Surgery Study Group. STUDY SELECTION: We used studies that provided the data that our decision model required--life expectancy and probabilities of outcomes in persons who have or do not have coronary artery disease. DATA EXTRACTION: We did not use a structured method for abstracting data. We tested the susceptibility of our conclusions to poor quality of data by substituting a wide range of values for a variable in the decision model, and by calculating life expectancy and costs if screening was used routinely or not used. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: We assumed that persons with an abnormal exercise test would have arteriography and that persons with severe coronary artery disease would have bypass surgery. When there were no suitable published data for the model, we made assumptions that favored screening. The model predicts that screening would increase the life expectancy of 60-year-old men at average risk by at most 12 days. Sixty-year-old men with no risk factors for coronary artery disease would derive less benefit, as would women and younger men. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise testing is too small to justify doing this procedure routinely in healthy persons. If coronary bypass surgery is found to prolong life in asymptomatic persons as much as it does in angina pectoris, screening older men with risk factors for coronary artery disease may prove to be worthwhile.\r"

  ".W": "A wide variety of specialized laboratory tests have been used to characterize prognosis and functional capacity soon after a patient has an acute myocardial infarction. Few attempts have been made to integrate the available data on these tests into clinically relevant guidelines for the clinician. This review evaluates the use of these tests, alone and in combination, throughout the course of recovery from acute myocardial infarction. The primary objective of these tests is to quantify myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction, the pathophysiologic basis of prognosis and functional capacity. The selection of one test over another depends on whether either test provides information on myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction not available through the standard clinical evaluation, and the risk, quality, and cost associated with each test. The stepwise application of specialized testing after acute myocardial infarction enables the identification of three groups of patients: approximately 20% at very high risk, due primarily to irreversible left ventricular dysfunction; approximately 30% at moderately high risk, due primarily to myocardial ischemia; and approximately 50% at low risk who are free of significant left ventricular dysfunction or myocardial ischemia. Accurate discrimination among these three groups enables the application of aggressive medical and surgical therapy to patients at moderate to high risk and accelerated recovery for patients at low risk. Specialized testing also helps to guide subsequent management after thrombolysis and revascularization procedures.\r"

On immunostaining, all three antibodies showed intracellular tangles in the hippocampal neurons of patients with ALS, patients with PD, and in neurologically normal Guamanians with neurofibrillary pathology, but the correlation of immunostaining between these antibodies was not absolute. Extracellular or ghost tangles were immunostained only with the antibody against paired helical filaments.

Sensitivity of the two thyrotropin assay kits in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis was 86% and 95%, and that in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was 92% and 94%. Other tests were nearly as sensitive in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis but not hypothyroidism. A cost analysis of a testing strategy that used either total T4, free T4 index, or sensitive thyrotropin assay alone as the first-line thyroid test disclosed that to establish the patient's thyroid metabolic status would have cost $11,093, $14,536, and $24,902, respectively, using each test first. We suggest that, at current prices, routine use of the thyrotropin assay as a first-line test in ambulatory patients is not as cost-effective as the free T4 index.\r"

Eleven amikacin-susceptible/-resistant pairs of isolates were analyzed for aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, plasmid profiles, cellular proteins, outer membrane proteins (OMPs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiles, and amikacin uptake. While clearly distinct from isolates of other patients, sensitive and resistant isolates from the same patients were indistinguishable in plasmid profile, LPS profiles, and OMPs. These results suggest that the resistant P aeruginosa isolates were derived from the sensitive isolates. None of the resistant isolates produced enzymes known to inactivate amikacin. In nine of 11 resistant isolates tested, transport of amikacin into P aeruginosa was reduced. A major mechanism of in vivo development of amikacin resistance in P aeruginosa is alteration in permeability to amikacin, but the aquisition of plasmids or changes in OMPs or LPS profile may not account for this phenomenon.\r"

Two forms of NANB hepatitis have been identified: (1) an epidemic type usually transmitted enterically and (2) a parenterally transmitted form caused by hepatitis C virus. While the latter often is assumed to be transfusion transmitted, data from surveillance programs suggest that the incidence of NANB transfusion-associated hepatitis (TAH) is decreasing. Strategies for preventing TAH include viral inactivation, testing for surrogate markers of NANB, and the appropriate use of blood components. Whether alanine aminotransferase and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen screening of donated blood will be effective in reducing the incidence of TAH is yet to be established. Specific tests for anti-hepatitis C virus may resolve problems associated with surrogate testing.\r"

Currently, anti-D is second in frequency only to anti-K as an alloantibody of clinical significance. Estimation of alloantibody frequencies in hospital patients reveals a gradual decline in the frequencies of anti-D and anti-CD, whereas anti-K, anti-E and anti-Jka show increases in relative and absolute frequencies. This phenomenon probably reflects the optimum use of Rhlg and more aggressive transfusion treatment of patients as indicated by the red cell use factor: (Red cell transfusions -- autologous transfusions)/admissions. Such a practice may be the result of the increasing severity of illness observed in patients admitted to hospitals. Alloimmunization due to donor white blood cells, platelets, and serum proteins also frequently follows the transfusion of homologous blood. These problems, which may pose additional risks to the transfusion recipient, are reviewed.\r"

During the past 20 years, other methods of streamlining compatibility testing have evolved. Two of the most successful approaches have employed microplates to perform either liquid agglutination tests or solid-phase red blood cell adherence tests. Increasing numbers of automated systems for compatibility testing, based on these technologies, have become commercially available. These systems were optimally designed for batch processing. More recently, dipsticks for ABO grouping and direct antiglobulin testing have been developed, which were ideally suited for individual testing.\r"

Measured energy expenditure (MEE) was compared with predictions of basal energy expenditure (BEE) and calculated energy expenditure, defined as the product of BEE and a stress factor estimated by the nutrition support service to account for severity of illness and activity. The MEE was significantly greater than the BEE and significantly less than the calculated energy expenditure. The estimated stress factor was significantly greater than the actual MEE/BEE ratio, and the correlation between these values was poor. Clinical assessment may overestimate energy expenditure in critically ill patients because of the apparent degree of illness used to determine the stress factor. Bedside indirect calorimetry may be useful to assess more accurately energy expenditure and optimize nutritional support.\r"

Within each stratum, the patients were randomized into three groups of treatment: (1) cefazolin, (2) cefotaxime, and (3) nontreatment (control). Antibiotics were administered perioperatively in three intravenous doses of 1 g at eight-hour intervals. Patients undergoing colon surgery or with peritonitis at the time of the operation were excluded from the study. The wound abscess rate was significantly lower in the treated groups than in the control group, except in stratum 3 (contaminated surgery). The percentage of postoperative peritonitis was twice as low in the treated groups as in the control group. There was no difference between the groups receiving cefazolin or cefotaxime. The patients in the treated groups received significantly less postoperative antibiotics than the patients in the control group. In terms of cost, antibioprophylaxis by cefazolin seems to be warranted in all operations with a low anaerobic contamination.\r"

The body clearances (CLRs) of ten amino acids (AAs) were estimated as a ratio of muscle-released AAs plus total parenteral nutrition-infused AAs to their extracellular pool. While clinically septic trauma (ST) patients without multiple-organ failure syndrome (MOFS) had a higher level of urea nitrogen production (25.6 +/- 13.4 g of N per day) compared with nonseptic trauma (NST) patients (14 +/- 7.5 g of N per day) and with ST patients with MOFS (4.28 +/- 1.5 g of N per day), in all groups urea N production was found to be a function of muscle protein degradation (catabolism), total parenteral nutrition-administered AAs, and the ratio between leucine CLR and tyrosine CLR (L/T) (r2 = .82, P less than .0001). Since tyrosine is cleared almost exclusively by the liver, the L/T ratio may be regarded as an index of hepatic function. The significant differences between urea N production in ST and NST patients lay in an increased positive dependence on muscle catabolism and increased negative correlation with L/T in the ST group. At any L/T ratio, urea N production was increased in ST patients over NST patients, but in ST patients with MOFS, it fell to or below levels of NST patients. These data show that the ST process is associated with enhancement of ureagenesis, due to increased hepatic CLR of both exogenous and endogenous AAs. In sepsis with MOFS, a marked inhibition of urea synthesis occurs, partially explained by a decreased hepatic CLR of non-branched-chain AAs.\r"

Clinical studies have been divided on the efficacy of protirelin (TRH) despite strong experimental findings that are consistent with a role for the peptide in ALS. Recent findings provide evidence of a gender-related specificity in the ability of protirelin to potentiate the monosynaptic reflex. While castration in male neonatal rats lowered the sensitivity to protirelin, testosterone treatment restored that sensitivity. An examination of the clinical studies reveals a failure either to identify patients' sex or to separate the results on the basis of sex. These findings provide convincing evidence for the potential efficacy of protirelin in ALS if the patient's sex and underlying hormonal status are taken into account.\r"

In fibroblast cultures, recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rHuIL-1 alpha), rHuIL-1 beta, and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rHuTNF alpha) stimulated hyaluronic acid (HA) production and, to a lesser extent, sulfated GAG production, while recombinant human gamma-interferon did not have a significant effect. Half-maximal stimulation of HA by rHuIL-1 beta was 0.14 pM, while stimulation for rHuIL-1 alpha and rHuTNF alpha was 1.6 pM and 32 pM, respectively. Indomethacin (10 micrograms/ml) had no influence on HA stimulation by cytokines, while hydrocortisone (2-10 micrograms/ml) caused a significant reduction. In articular cartilage cultures, the cytokines inhibited production of sulfated GAGs. The activity of rHuIL-1 beta was greater than that of rHuIL-1 alpha (half-maximal inhibition at 0.71 pM and 4.7 pM, respectively) and both were considerably more active than rHuTNF alpha; gamma-interferon again had no significant effect. Neither indomethacin nor hydrocortisone influenced cytokine-induced inhibition by either rHuIL-1 preparation. These studies indicate that cytokines released during an inflammatory process may affect GAG synthesis in human joint tissues and may have opposite effects on GAG synthesis in different types of connective tissues.\r"

  ".U": "89150014\r", 
  ".W": "The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a circulating peptide, consisting of 24 to 28 amino acids. Atrial natriuretic factor is synthetized in atrial cardiomyocytes and stored in specific cytoplasmatic granules. It possesses potent diuretic, natriuretic, and vasorelexant properties. The possible role of ANF in the pathogenesis of hypertension and heart failure was investigated in animal models and in men. We were able to show that the release of ANF from cardiac atria is positively correlated with atrial pressures in both men and rats. In experimental studies, plasma levels of ANF measured by radioimmunoassay, were increased by up to four-fold after acute blood volume expansion. Atrial natriuretic factor release in response to volume loading was markedly attenuated in four-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats as compared to age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, but a similar responsiveness was found in 16-week-old rats of both strains. This finding can be reconciled with the hypothesis that ANF plays a pathophysiological role in initiating but not maintaining high blood pressure. Clinical studies demonstrate elevated plasma concentrations of ANF in patients with organic heart disease. Further increments in plasma levels of ANF were obtained during physical exercise and after acute volume loading. In patients with congestive cardiomyopathy, the elevated plasma concentrations of ANF reached almost normal levels following improvement of their hemodynamic disturbances after treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors. These findings suggest that in patients with organic heart disease, plasma concentrations of ANF reflect the hemodynamic burden of the heart and may, therefore, be used as a noninvasive marker of the efficacy of the current cardiac therapy.\r"

Their expression is linked to differential responsiveness of the cells to growth factors and inhibitors. We examined the expression of different MHC class II antigens in a panel of human myelomonocytic cell lines representing different stages of differentiation, by cytofluorographic analysis with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and Northern blot analysis with specific cDNA probes. These analyses revealed discordant expression of different MHC class II antigens both in basal state and after gamma-IFN induction. Thus KG-1 myeloblast cells express all class II antigens (DR greater than DP greater than DQ) constitutively and their expression increased after gamma-IFN treatment. KG-1a, an immature blast variant of KG-1, does not express class II antigens, even after gamma-IFN treatment. THP-1, a monocytic cell line expresses DR but not DP or DQ under basal conditions. DP and DQ are, however, gamma-IFN inducible. The class II negative HL-60 promyelocytic cell line, expresses DR and DP but not DQ after gamma-IFN induction. In all the above cell lines, surface expression of class II antigens correlated with the levels of mRNA expression as determined with specific cDNA probes. In U-937, a monocytic cell line, no surface expression of class II MHC antigens was observed either with or without gamma-IFN, however, specific mRNA message was observed under basal conditions and was further increased with gamma-IFN, indicating a possible defect in assembly or transport of class II antigens. The patterns of class II MHC antigens in these leukemic cell lines may be a useful model to delineate molecular basis of discordant MHC class II expression during myelomonocytic differentiation.\r"

LACI was tested from 7.8 to 500 pmol/L on fibroblasts cultured at cell densities ranging from 3,500 to 9,925 cells/well, and caused a progressive inhibition of tissue factor activity. PAP was tested from 3.9 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L at cell densities ranging from 4,500 to 15,400 cells/well and caused up to 83% inhibition of tissue factor activity. Inhibition by these proteins appeared to be influenced by cell density as well as whether the cells were intact or disrupted. Apo A-II, up to 1 mumol/L, did not inhibit the tissue factor activity of intact or disrupted fibroblasts at any cell density examined even though it did inhibit the activity of tissue factor in phospholipid vesicles. Of these inhibitors of tissue factor-dependent activation of factor X, LACI was the most effective in suppressing the generation of factor Xa activity. The effects obtained with apo A-II are clearly dependent on the nature of the tissue factor preparation with which it is tested. The disparity between the inhibitory effect of apo A-II on the activity of tissue factor reconstituted into lipid vesicles and the absence of effect on the activity of tissue factor remaining in cell membranes serves to reemphasize the necessity of reexamining results obtained with model systems using as nearly physiological reagents as possible.\r"

  ".W": "A significant fraction (30%) of the genetically determined variance in plasma concentration of the von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag) has been shown to be related to ABH determinants. Individuals with blood group O, who have the highest amounts of blood group H substance, have the lowest concentration of vWf:Ag. The Lewis substances, Le(a) and Le(b), are biochemically closely related to the ABH substances as both can be produced from the same precursor substance. We studied the effect of the presence of the Lewis antigens on the plasma concentration of vWf:Ag and factor VIII antigen (VIII:Ag) in 323 individuals of different ABO groups from a series of twins and in 58 blood donors of blood group O. Among persons belonging to blood group O, those with the Le(a) antigen had a higher concentration of both vWf:Ag and VIII:Ag than individuals lacking Le(a). Le(a+b-) people are nonsecretors and Le(a-b+) people are secretors of ABH substance. Thus, the lowest concentration of vWf:Ag and VIII:Ag was found in group O secretors. The effect is most likely due to an effect of the secretor locus. This finding may be of importance for the detection of carriers of hemophilia A and for the diagnosis of type I von Willebrand disease.\r"

Risk factors for cerebral infarction were present in 196 (80%) cases; hypertension in 126 (52%); ischaemic heart disease in 92 (38%); peripheral vascular disease in 60 (25%); a cardiac lesion that was a major potential source of embolism to the brain in 50 (20%); transient ischaemic attacks in 35 (14%); cervical arterial bruit in 33 (14%); and diabetes mellitus in 24 (10%). Thirty one patients (13%) were in atrial fibrillation. Of the 48 patients who were free of risk factors or a major potential cardiac source of embolism at the time of the stroke, 18 were found to have hypertension after the stroke and 10 to have non-atheromatous non-embolic conditions (migrainous cerebral infarction (three), arteritis (two), inflammatory bowel disease (one), arterial trauma (one), autoimmune disease (one), carcinoma of the thyroid (one), and major operation (one). In 20 patients no causative factors could be identified. In this unselected series of patients with first ever stroke due to cerebral infarction most of the strokes were presumed to be due to either atheromatous arterial disease or embolism from the heart, and only 4% (95% confidence interval 2 to 7%) were probably due to non-atheromatous non-embolic causes. This has implications for research into strokes and allocation of public health expenditure.\r"

SETTING--HEPATOLOGY outpatient clinics in secondary referral centres. PATIENTS--Fourteen adults with histologically proved chronic hepatitis and persistently raised aminotransferase activities for six months or more. INTERVENTIONS--Seven patients randomised to receive interferon alfa 5 megaunits (MU) daily for one week, reducing to 5 MU thrice weekly for seven weeks, then 3 MU thrice weekly for eight weeks. Controls not treated. END POINT--Control of hepatic enzyme activity in chronic non-A non-B hepatitis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Serum aspartate aminotransferase activity remained raised in controls (mean increase in study period 23.4 U/l) but fell rapidly to normal in the treated group (mean decrease 106.4 U/l). In four cases values were normal by eight weeks and in five cases by 16 weeks. Only minor side effects were recorded (fever, myalgia), which became less common as treatment progressed. CONCLUSIONS--Continuous low dose interferon alfa reduces aspartate aminotransferase activity to normal in most patients with chronic non-A non-B hepatitis and may prevent progression to cirrhosis.\r"

DESIGN--Eight week randomised double blind parallel group study. SETTING--Forty six gastroenterology outpatient clinics in seven countries. PATIENTS--Two hundred and twenty patients aged 18-70 who met the following criteria: clinical activity index greater than or equal to 6 and endoscopic index greater than or equal to 4; no concomitant treatment for ulcerative colitis; no hypersensitivity to salicylates or sulphonamides. Of the 164 patients eligible for efficacy analysis, 87 received the coated preparation of mesalazine and 77 sulphasalazine. Most of the remaining patients (28 in each group) were ineligible for the efficacy analysis because of treatment with steroid enemas. All pretrial characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups. INTERVENTIONS--Coated mesalazine (Mesasal) 1.5 g daily or sulphasalazine 3.0 g daily for eight weeks. Compliance monitored by pill counts. END POINT--Clinical and endoscopic remission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Clinical activity measured by daily diary cards, assessment by investigators, and laboratory findings. Endoscopic evaluation at week 8. After four weeks 50 of 70 patients (71%) taking coated mesalazine and 38 of 58 (66%) taking sulphasalazine had achieved remission of their disease by eight weeks remission rates were 74% (37/50 patients) and 81% (35/43) in the two treatment groups respectively. Endoscopic remission at eight weeks was recorded in 20 of 41 patients (49%) taking coated mesalazine and 18 of 38 (47%) taking sulphasalazine. There was a higher incidence of adverse events among patients taking sulphasalazine (25/105; 24%) than among those taking coated mesalazine (16/115; 14%). CONCLUSION--Mesalazine coated with Eudragit L is a safe, logical alternative to sulphasalazine.\r"

The adoptees represented four groups who by sampling from a larger population were categorised as either thin, medium weight, overweight, or obese. Weight and height were obtained for 115 full siblings of 57 adoptees and for 850 half siblings of 341 adoptees. In full siblings body mass index (kg/m2) significantly increased with weight of the adoptees. Body mass index of the half siblings showed a steady but weaker increase across the four weight groups of adoptees. There were no significant interactions with sex of the adoptees, sex of the siblings, or (for the half siblings) sex of the common parent. In contrast with the findings in half siblings and (previously) the natural parents there was a striking, significant increase in body mass index between full siblings of overweight and obese adoptees. The degree of fatness in adults living in the same environment appears to be influenced by genetic factors independent of sex, which may include polygenic as well as major gene effects on obesity.\r"

  ".W": "A sample of 2885 children aged 12 and 13 who completed a questionnaire survey in school in January 1987 were given a second questionnaire on a specified date in May 1987. The smoking habits, parental smoking habits, sex, and social background of the children who were present on both dates were compared with those of the children who were absent on the second occasion. Regular smoking was significantly more common among those absent for the second questionnaire: among boys 181/877 (21%) who never smoked, 109/486 (22%) who sometimes smoked, and 21/45 (47%) who regularly smoked were absent, and among girls the figures were 157/947 (17%), 117/487 (24%), and 17/43 (40%) respectively. Thus the odds ratio for those who sometimes smoked was 1.29 and for regular smokers 3.09 against those who never smoked. Whatever the children's smoking habits, the proportion who were absent was higher when both parents or at least the mother smoked, the odds ratio being 1.39; the proportions absent were 203/1180 (17%) if neither parent or only the father smoked v 135/644 (21%) if both parents or only mother smoked for children who never smoked; 105/529 (20%) v 121/444 (27%) for those who sometimes smoked; and 10/27 (37%) v 28/61 (46%) for those who regularly smoked. Sex and social background had little effect, though there was an overall higher rate of absence among boys from industrial areas. The findings show a higher rate of minor ailments in children who smoke and in children whose mother smokes. If children are having frequent days off school for minor ailments possibly they or their parents would benefit from advice and help in stopping smoking.\r"

Food and stool samples, environmental samples, and eggs and environmental swabs from the egg suppliers were examined microbiologically. Altogether 474 questionnaires were returned, 120 people reporting gastrointestinal illness. The illness was significantly associated with foods containing mayonnaise. Salmonella typhimurium definitive type 49 was isolated from 76 of the 84 stool samples containing salmonella and from five of the eight samples taken from the chicken house of the main egg supplier. Mayonnaise was probably the vehicle of infection, which was caused by S typhimurium definitive type 49.\r"

Successful long-term suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone was observed without any escape of testosterone. Ten patients were considered nonresponders, whereas nine were defined as responders (had either stabilized or regressed). Serum prostate-specific markers, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), were monitored at fixed time intervals throughout treatment in these patients. Simultaneous determinations of both markers was made under treatment in 147 samples. The results suggest a high correlation between the disease state and the level of the markers (P less than 0.0001), as well as a very high correlation between serum concentrations of the markers themselves (correlation coefficient = 0.6). Thus, the authors could not point clearly towards a superiority of any marker when monitoring response to GnRH analogue treatment. Contrary to current belief, the pretreatment values of both markers were of no prognostic value with regard to response or survival.\r"

Plasma glyburide and urinary cis-3-hydroxy-(30H) and trans-4-hydroxyglyburide (40H) were measured by a sensitive HPLC assay. No unchanged glyburide was detected in urine but both metabolites were identified in urine in all subjects. There were no significant differences in any respect with regard to glyburide metabolism or pharmacokinetics between EM and PM of debrisoquin. Estimated mean elimination half-life of glyburide was 3.3 +/- 1.1 hours for EM and 2.5 +/- 0.4 hours for PM. In one subject (EM), with reduced excretion of 30H, glyburide was detected in plasma at 24 and 30 hours and the apparent elimination half-life was 9.3 hours. There was no significant difference for total metabolite recovery between EM and PM. Eight of the subjects (six EM and two PM) had previously taken part in a study of tolbutamide metabolism, and a comparison of metabolic clearances by hydroxylation for the two sulfonylurea drugs showed no significant correlation. Glyburide is therefore unlikely to be metabolized by the enzymes that metabolize either debrisoquin or tolbutamide.\r"

It has recently been shown that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients have increased urinary water and salt excretion during sleep which tends to normalize with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. 2. To investigate the mechanisms of these changes in renal function, nocturnal urinary excretion of catecholamines and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP), which reflects atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release, and next-morning plasma active renin concentrations were studied in 21 OSA patients on 2 consecutive nights, either untreated or treated with nasal CPAP. 3. In keeping with previous results, fractional urine flow and fractional Na+ and Cl- excretions were higher during untreated than during CPAP-treated nights. 4. No difference in plasma active renin concentration or in urinary excretion of noradrenaline, adrenaline, free dopamine and total dopamine could be demonstrated, but cyclic GMP excretion was significantly higher during untreated than during CPAP-treated nights. 5. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased water and salt excretion in OSA patients is due to increased ANF release. 6. The proposed mechanism is an atrial distension due to increased (more negative) intrathoracic pressures during ineffective inspiratory efforts against the occluded upper airways which have been found in OSA.\r"

The two diets contained the same amount of cholesterol (400 mg), and the polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratio was similar and comparatively low (0.35 on the standard vs 0.36 on the olive oil diet). 3. At the end of the study the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membranes showed the following changes: the oleic acid content increased by 15.7% and the amount of saturated fatty acid decreased by 3.2%. The polyunsaturated fatty acid content tended to decrease, while the polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratio did not change significantly. The cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio increased significantly by 7.8%, still remaining within the reference range. 4. At the same time, the mean values of the maximum rates of the cation fluxes mediated by the Na+ -K+ pump, and by Na+ -K+ co-transport rose significantly, while the maximal rate of Na+ -L+ countertransport showed a non-significant trend towards lower values. 5. Urinary excretion of Na+ and K+, body weight and blood pressure did not change significantly.\r"

Levels were also measured in rats that were maintained in hypoxia for 7 days and then returned to air for 24 h. 2. Plasma ANP was not altered at 2 h but was significantly increased at both 24 h and at 7 days. Plasma ANP in animals exposed to hypoxia for 7 days was normal 24 h after returning to air breathing, despite the persistence of indices of pulmonary hypertension. 3. No significant right atrial hypertrophy was observed under these conditions of chronic hypoxia. A reduction in right atrial ANP content was found at 24 h and was accompanied by a decrease in the number of electrondense granules per right atrial muscle cell. After exposure to hypoxia for 7 days, right atrial ANP and granule number was not different from control, and no alteration was found in right atrial ANP level after removal from the hypoxic environment. 4. No significant right ventricular hypertrophy was produced by exposure to hypoxia for 2 or 24 h. In the former group ventricular ANP had decreased significantly compared with control. Right ventricular hypertrophy was found in both the hypoxic groups after exposure for 7 days, when selective increases in right ventricular ANP content were found. 5. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ANP release occurs on exposure to chronic hypoxia and is independent of the associated cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodelling. The findings may have relevance to the natriuresis and reported changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis under hypoxic conditions.\r"

We therefore tested the hypothesis that hydrochloric acid (HCl) infusion could improve PaCO2 in 15 critically ill patients admitted with mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, and a pH of between 7.35 and 7.45. HCl was infused at a constant rate of 25 mmol/h until the bicarbonate concentration decreased less than 26 mmol/L, or until the pH decreased less than 7.35 (initial pH greater than 7.40) or 7.30 (initial pH less than 7.40). Administration of 170 +/- 53 mmol of HCl decreased the bicarbonate concentration from 34 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 2 mmol/L (p less than .001), the pH from 7.41 +/- 0.03 to 7.33 +/- 0.02 (p less than .001), and the PaCO2 from 54 +/- 8 to 48 +/- 8 torr (p less than .001). Postinfusion PaCO2 could be predicted accurately from the initial status of the patients (r = .95, p less than .001) except in one patient with fixed hypercapnia. PaCO2 increased from 77 +/- 19 to 94 +/- 24 torr (p less than .001) and PaO2/PAO2 increased from 59 +/- 17 to 66 +/- 17% (p less than .001). The effects of HCl were still present 12 h after the end of the infusion. No complications related to the acid infusion were noted. These results indicate that, even in the absence of alkalemia, active correction of metabolic alkalosis by HCl infusion can improve CO2 and oxygen exchange in critically ill patients with mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.\r"

A striking increase in PetCO2 follows return of spontaneous circulation. Since PaCO2 is closely related to alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) and therefore PetCO2, we hypothesized that PaCO2 may itself serve as an indicator of the blood flow generated during CPR. In a porcine model of cardiac arrest, PaCO2 during precordial compression was highly correlated with PetCO2 (r = .89), cardiac output (r = .72), and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) (r = .74). In 14 successfully resuscitated animals, PaCO2, PetCO2, and CPP during precordial compression were significantly higher than in nine nonresuscitated animals. After restoration of spontaneous circulation, there was a marked increase in PaCO2 to levels exceeding control values, which corresponded to the sharp increase in PetCO2 that is characteristic of successful resuscitation. We therefore confirm that both PetCO2 and PaCO2 correspond to the pulmonary blood flow and therefore cardiac output which is generated by precordial compression during CPR. Moreover, both serve as prognosticators of cardiac resuscitability and early indicators that spontaneous circulation has been restored.\r"

Arterial and mixed venous saturations were measured by fiberoptic vascular catheters and oxygen exchange by a gas monitor. Twelve direct and derived variables were monitored every 20 sec using a computer data acquisition system. Arterial oxygen saturation was kept at 90 +/- 2% by adjustment of FIO2. Ethanol produced only transitory changes during infusion. Significant elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), shunt (Qsp/Qt) and deadspace (VD/VT) were observed during and after ECV. These were unaccompanied by changes in cardiac output or arterial pressure. PVR increased by 137%, Qsp/Qt by 67%, and VD/VT by 28% over 30 min.

CMV infection was diagnosed by a change in the serologic status, viral culture, or histology of lung tissue. Of 18 patients who were preoperatively negative for CMV antibody, eight received organs from CMV antibody-positive donors. Five developed pneumonitis (fatal in three)l; one survived primary CMV of the GI tract. Those who recovered from CMV pneumonitis received IV ganciclovir with CMV hyperimmune globulin given prophylactically from the time of transplantation. Only three of ten antibody-negative patients receiving organs from antibody-negative donors developed primary CMV, characterized by only fever in two but associated with rejection, and repeated infection was fatal in a third. CMV reactivation/reinfection occurred in seven of 15 (47 percent) without clinical disease in all but one case. Following heart-lung transplantation, CMV is the cause of considerable mortality and morbidity. We recommend that CMV antibody-negative recipients should receive organs only from antibody-negative donors. If a donor/recipient mismatch occurs, hyperimmune globulin and ganciclovir may improve survival.\r"

The variable anatomic distribution of diverticula in different ethnic groups implies that fiber deficiency is not the only factor responsible for this condition.

Retention of SeHCAT did not differ significantly between patients with an ileostomy and patients with pouch-anal anastomosis, but patients with an ileostomy and ileal resection of more than 20 cm retained less SeHCAT than patients with a pouch-anal anastomosis (P less than .01). Analysis of fecal bile acids from ileostomies and pouches showed that bacterial metabolism of primary conjugated bile acids was greater in patients with a pouch. It was concluded that bile acid absorption was not significantly impaired by construction of a pouch compared with conventional ileostomy, but bacterial metabolism of bile acids was greater in the pouches.\r"

The mean levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 17 patients fell from 156 +/- 80 (mean +/- SD) and 213 +/- 135 at the beginning of treatment to 94 +/- 49 and 112 +/- 71, respectively, at the end of treatment. In 12 patients, liver biopsies were performed before and after (or during) the treatment, and histological activity indices (HAI) were blindly examined by two independent observers. For comparison, we examined histological changes of pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies of 19 patients who were treated by recombinant interferon for chronic hepatitis B. Mean HAI scores improved from 10.0 to 5.4 after treatment in non-A, non-B chronic hepatitis. The most marked reduction was noted in scores of portal inflammation and hepatocellular degeneration and/or necrosis. No such reduction was observed in B-viral chronic hepatitis. These data indicated that rapid biochemical resolution by the treatment was related to histological improvement of the liver in our patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic intragastric infusion of hypertonic mannitol on small intestinal mucosal structure and function was studied in adult rats. Animals were gavage-fed 20% mannitol (1300 mosm) at a dose of 5 ml/100 g body weight daily for seven days. Control animals were gavage-fed tap water on the same schedule. On day 8, the animals were anesthetized, the duodenum cannulated, and a test sugar (glucose, glucose polymer, lactose, sucrose, or maltose) was infused at a dose of 0.5 g/kg body weight in 2.5 ml distilled water over less than 1 min. Portal vein glucose was measured at 30-min intervals from 0 to 120 min. Mannitol treatment resulted in histologic and biochemical alterations (reduced lactase, sucrase, maltase) limited to the proximal small intestine compared to the control group. The absorption of glucose and glucose polymers was similar in mannitol-treated and control animals. In contrast, digestion and absorption of lactose, sucrose, and maltose was significantly diminished in mannitol-treated animals when compared to controls. No changes in permeability to polyethylene glycol 4000 or Na+-coupled glucose transport were observed in mannitol-treated animals compared to controls. These data suggest that when the intestinal mucosa is exposed to hyperosmolar loads that the digestive capacity for disaccharides is suppressed more than its glucose absorptive capacities. Furthermore, glucose oligomers may be more readily digested and absorbed than disaccharides, in this setting, due, in part, to the proximal injury and less pronounced proximal-distal gradient for glucoamylase than other brush-border carbohydrases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examined whether indomethacin-induced increases in small intestinal permeability in man are prevented by concomitant administration of a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol). Twelve male volunteers were tested as baseline, following misoprostol alone (200 micrograms, at -16, -12, -8.5, -4, -1.5, and +4 hr); following indomethacin alone (75 mg, at -8; 50 mg, -1 hr); and following coadministration of misoprostol and indomethacin as specified above. A 100-ml test solution containing 3-O-methyl glucose (0.2 g), D-xylose (0.5 g), L-rhamnose (1.0 g), and [51Cr]EDTA (100 microCi) was ingested at 8 AM, and a 5-hr collection made for marker analysis to assess active and passive carrier-mediated transport and trans- and intercellular permeation, respectively. Indomethacin increased the permeation of [51Cr]EDTA selectively, and this increase was significantly reduced by the coadministration of misoprostol. These changes were mirrored by changes in [51Cr]EDTA-L-rhamnose urine excretion ratios, which indicates that paracellular permeability was specifically altered. This study supports the suggestion that NSAIDs alter intestinal permeability by a mechanism involving reduced prostaglandin synthesis and indicates that coadministration of misoprostol with NSAIDs may reduce the frequency and severity of NSAID-induced small intestinal inflammation.\r"

The synthetic PGs dimethyl-PGE2 and rioprostil were administered orally, and their preventive effect on gastric ulceration was evaluated by determining the incidence and the ulcer index of lesions. The curative effect of drugs on ulcer healing was evaluated by determining a time-dependent change in the mucosal surface of the stomach with an endoscopic technique. Oral administration of dimethyl-PGE2 or rioprostil (25 and 50 micrograms/kg) prevented gastric ulceration significantly. Oral administration of these drugs (50 micrograms/kg, twice per day) significantly promoted the healing process of lesions 24 and 36 hr after termination of stress loading. The present results give direct evidence of the curative effect of PGs on stress ulcers and suggest that application of the endoscopic technique to the pathology of the rat's stomach may be a substantial aid in the preclinical evaluation of antiulcer drugs.\r"

There was no difference in cumulative follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, although at times during treatment mean levels of these hormones were lower with leuprolide. Higher P levels in the danazol group, most likely of adrenal origin, indicated a suppressive effect on adrenal steroidogenesis. Symptomatic improvement was significant in both groups. Laparoscopy after treatment also demonstrated a decrease in endometriosis scores in both groups. At 12 months after treatment, cumulative pregnancy and live birth rates were similar in both groups. Leuprolide offers an attractive alternative to danazol for the medical treatment of endometriosis.\r"

During 6 months of treatment, peripheral follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol concentrations were suppressed to a similar degree in both groups. Symptomatic improvement and laparoscopically assessed regression of endometriotic lesions also were comparable. After treatment, 8 of 18 infertile women treated with Buserelin and 5 of 8 treated with danazol conceived. General and hypoestrogenic side effects were similar in both groups, while androgenic and anabolic were more frequent with danazol. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased in the Buserelin and decreased in the danazol group. The study indicates that at the dose tested, buserelin and danazol induce a similar degree of ovarian suppression resulting in a comparable clinical improvement and regression of endometriotic lesions.\r"

Follow-up after treatment revealed persistent relief from dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia in, respectively, 58.6% and 88.2% of the women, whereas pelvic pain returned to pretreatment scores. Serum estradiol (E2) was suppressed to predominantly early follicular phase concentrations. Laparoscopy at the end of therapy showed significant reduction of scores for implants only. There was no relation between the degree of E2 suppression during therapy and the improvement of symptoms or the reduction of endometriosis. Statistical analysis in 22 infertile patients, of whom 7 conceived during follow-up, revealed no differences in E2 levels during therapy, improvement of symptoms, or reduction of endometriosis. Buserelin appears to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in the management of endometriosis and associated complaints.\r"

They received three regimens of 5 days of pulsatile LH-RH (5 micrograms/pulse) given at 30-, 90-, or 180-minute intervals, with at least 6 weeks between treatments. On day 1, LH and FSH increased in proportion to the LH-RH pulse frequency. After 5 days of treatment with the 30- and 90-minute intervals, LH was still elevated, but FSH had returned to pretreatment levels together with a decline of the FSH response. The LH response only declined during treatment with the 30-minute pulse interval. During each treatment, estradiol (E2) increased. Explanations for dissociation between LH and FSH secretion during treatment with higher LH-RH pulse frequencies could be: (1) desensitization of FSH rather than LH secretion on LH-RH; (2) a differential effect of E2 on LH and FSH; (3) nonsteroidal ovarian factors selectively regulating LH and/or FSH release.\r"

Five patients with PCO who failed to conceive on the hMG regimen also received pulsatile FSH administration. Although ovulation rates in PCO patients did not differ significantly between the hMG (88.1%) and FSH (88.2%) regimens, a significant reduction in the average dose of FSH (P less than 0.05) was observed with pulsatile FSH administration. Furthermore, the number of patients who conceived during the FSH regimen was significantly greater than that found with hMG treatment. The present data demonstrate that pulsatile subcutaneous administration of hMG or FSH is effective in induction of successful ovulation and establishment of singleton pregnancy in patients with various types of anovulatory infertility.\r"

We have prospectively evaluated 31 consecutive patients managed with this appliance and our results show that the button can be successfully placed in 90% of cases without serious morbidity or mortality. The procedure is quick to perform, requires minimal intravenous sedation, and is well-suited to a broad range of socially active gastrostomy-dependent patients. Patients found the aesthetics, convenience, and independence of the low profile design attractive and no individual wished to return to the original method of feeding. Small and medium-sized buttons were easier to place than larger devices. Gastrocutaneous reflux through the appliance occurred in 11% of cases and was a common cause for replacement. Alert, ambulatory patients with an established gastrostomy and short or medium-sized gastrocutaneous fistulous tracts are ideal candidates for the button.\r"

In order to determine whether nitrogen balance can be improved in routine clinical practice by prescribing enteral diets containing higher concentrations of nutrients, 118 patients with normal gastrointestinal function needing enteral nutrition were randomised to receive daily 21 of one of three polymeric diets: Standard diet (1.0 kcal/ml; 6.3 gN/l), Energy Dense diet (1.5 kcal/ml; 7.8 gN/l), and Energy-Nitrogen Dense diet (1.5 kcal/ml; 9.4 gN/l. The three diets, administered by continuous nasogastric infusion, were equally well tolerated. Results were analysed only for patients fed five or more days and who received at least 60% of prescribed enteral diet (n = 42). Positive nitrogen balance was achieved only in the patients receiving the Energy-Nitrogen Dense diet (n = 16; + 1.6 (SE) 0.6 gN/d, compared with the Standard diet (n = 12; -3.8 (1.1) gN/d; p less than 0.001), and the Energy Dense diet (m = 14; -1.9 (0.8) gN/d; p less than 0.005). As the findings of this prospective controlled trial show that positive nitrogen balance was not consistently achieved by administering 21 enteral diet containing up to 15.6 gN, consideration could, therefore, be given to routinely using enteral diets containing up to 9.4 gN/l.\r"

The fat-storing cells, which could be subcultured for at least 10 passages, have the main morphological characteristics already described in vivo, in particular, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the lipid droplets, which become less and less apparent as the number of passages increases. Subcultured fat-storing cells, almost devoid of lipid droplets and vitamin A, were able to take up retinol, as the appearance of a typical autofluorescence indicated; the number of lipid droplets increased concomitantly. Furthermore, the cultured fat-storing cells were able to internalize one-micron-sized latex beads by phagocytosis. Infection of fat-storing cells with mouse hepatitis virus 3, ectromelia or Sindbis virus led to multiplication of the virus particles. There was a direct relation between the multiplication of mouse hepatitis virus 3 in cultured fat-storing cells and the susceptibility of the animals to the virus. In the case of Sindbis virus, interferon is produced, its production being independent of the presence of vitamin A.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the atrial natriuretic factor and of the main counteracting sodium-retaining principle, the renin-aldosterone system, in acute volume regulation of cirrhosis of the liver has been investigated. Central volume stimulation was achieved in 21 patients with cirrhosis, 11 without and 10 with ascites, and 25 healthy controls by 1-hr head-out water immersion. Immersion prompted a highly significant (p less than 0.001) increase of atrial natriuretic factor plasma concentrations in cirrhotic patients without ascites from 8.5 +/- 1.3 fmoles per ml to 16.5 +/- 2.6 fmoles per ml, comparable to the stimulation in control subjects (6.0 +/- 0.6 fmoles per ml to 13.6 +/- 2.6 fmoles per ml). In cirrhotic patients with ascites, atrial natriuretic factor increase (from 7.7 +/- 1.3 fmoles per ml to 11.4 +/- 2.3 fmoles per ml) was blunted (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were elevated in cirrhotic patients, especially in the presence of ascites. Following immersion, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were reduced similarly in all groups. Water immersion induced a more pronounced natriuresis and diuresis in control subjects than in cirrhotic patients. Neither atrial natriuretic factor nor plasma renin activity nor plasma aldosterone concentration alone correlated to sodium excretion. However, atrial natriuretic factor to plasma aldosterone concentration ratios were closely correlated to basal and stimulated natriuresis in cirrhotic patients, particularly in those with ascites. These data suggest that atrial natriuretic factor and the renin-aldosterone system influence volume regulation in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

Systemic hemodynamics, blood gases and lactate concentration were measured in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis before and after intravenous dobutamine, propranolol and nitroglycerin. Nine patients received successively dobutamine and then propranolol. Ten patients received nitroglycerin. Three other patients without cirrhosis (controls) received dobutamine. In patients with cirrhosis, dobutamine infusion was accompanied by a significant increase in cardiac output (+21%), systemic O2 transport (+21%) and O2 uptake (+12%), whereas O2 extraction ratio and arterial lactate concentration did not change significantly. Propranolol administration was followed by a significant decrease in cardiac output (-24%) and systemic O2 transport (-25%) and a significant increase in O2 extraction ratio (+19%), whereas O2 uptake and arterial lactate concentration did not change. Nitroglycerin infusion was accompanied by a significant decrease in cardiac output (-21%), systemic O2 transport (-26%) and O2 uptake (-10%), whereas O2 extraction ratio (+18%) and arterial lactate concentration (+31%) significantly increased. In control patients, dobutamine infusion was accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and in systemic O2 transport and by a decrease in O2 extraction ratio, whereas O2 uptake was not modified. These results suggest that O2 uptake may be abnormally dependent on O2 transport in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

Statistical analysis revealed that the incidence of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis was independent of the use of blood positive for anti-HBc. Based upon these results and the high prevalence (17.3%) of anti-HBc among our blood donor population, the exclusion of anti-HBc-positive blood does not seem appropriate to achieve a reduction in the incidence of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis.\r"

None of them were IgM anti-hepatitis A virus positive on admission. Of the 34 patients who were HBeAg positive initially, two (5.9%) were diagnosed as having delta superinfection, and another two (5.9%) were suspected to have non-A, non-B virus superinfection because of a transient decrease of serum hepatitis B virus DNA. The remaining 30 (88.2%) cases were hepatitis B virus DNA negative with or without anti-HBe seroconversion on follow-up. The episodes of acute hepatitis in these cases may represent \"immune clearance of HBeAg\" or \"immune clearance of hepatitis B virus with delayed anti-HBe seroconversion,\" respectively, in the natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Of the patients who were anti-HBe positive initially, 23 (54.8%) were diagnosed as having delta superinfection, including eight with de novo seroconversion of anti-delta and 15 with a rising titer of anti-delta; 10 (23.8%) were positive for hepatitis B virus DNA and were considered as reactivation of hepatitis B virus, and the other nine (21.4%) were suspected as having non-A, non-B virus superinfection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximum lymphokine-activated killer activity was induced at 3 to 5 days of incubation, and lymphokine-activated killer activity tended to increase in a manner dose dependent of recombinant interleukin-2. However, the maximum increase of lymphokine-activated killer activity in hepatocellular carcinoma was not as high as that of normal subjects or liver cirrhosis patients. Lymphokine-activated killer activity was impaired in hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to that in normal subjects. Hepatocellular carcinoma seemed to consist of two groups: i.e. a high-lymphokine-activated killer activity group and a low-lymphokine-activated killer activity group. Reduction of natural killer activity was also observed in hepatocellular carcinoma as compared with that in normal subjects and patients with liver cirrhosis. No correlation could be demonstrated between natural killer activity and lymphokine-activated killer activity in normal subjects, liver cirrhosis patients and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. With regard to the presence of HBsAg or alpha-fetoprotein concentration in the sera, there was no significant difference in natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer activity in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Patients with a small mass lesion showed a low lymphokine-activated killer activity, and depressed lymphokine-activated killer activity was not necessarily related to tumor size. In comparison with the high-lymphokine-activated killer group, the low-lymphokine-activated killer group showed a significant decrease in gamma-interferon production and a preserved function of indocyanine green clearance.\r"

These cells were characterized with respect to their specific activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and beta-glucuronidase and of select Phase I and Phase II enzymes of biotransformation. At the time of their isolation, only a very small number of the bile ductular epithelial cells were observed to be in DNA synthesis. In addition, in histological sections prepared from intact hyperplastic bile ductular tissue isolates, only the bile ductular epithelial cells exhibited histochemical staining for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. Typically, greater than 95% of the cells isolated from this tissue were also found to be histochemically positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and no hepatocytes were seen contaminating this cell population. Biochemically, the isolated bile ductular cells exhibited a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase specific activity that was 100 times higher than that of hepatocytes isolated at the same time from the bile duct-ligated rats and more than 300 times higher than the specific activity of the enzyme of freshly isolated normal rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was investigated in six supine, sodium-replete, normal volunteers who received captopril (10 mg i.v. bolus followed by 10 mg/hr constant infusion) or vehicle superimposed on background 3-hour, constant, low-dose (1.5 pmol/kg/min) infusions of human ANF (99-126). Plasma converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited but this had no effect on endogenous plasma ANF concentrations. ANF infusions, with or without captopril, caused similar increases in plasma ANF concentrations, and calculated metabolic clearance rates for ANF were unchanged. Similarly, blood pressure, heart rate, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and renal electrolyte excretion, including ANF-induced natriuresis, were unaffected by captopril. The combination of ANF plus captopril produced a significant increase in plasma aldosterone (79 +/- 8 vs. 60 +/- 6 pmol/l, p less than 0.05), cortisol (406 +/- 52 vs. 265 +/- 29 nmol/l, p less than 0.01), adrenaline (119 +/- 21 vs. 76 +/- 10 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), and noradrenaline (319 +/- 49 vs. 215 +/- 38 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with time-matched placebo data. Converting enzyme inhibition, in the absence of major changes in blood pressure or renal blood flow, has little effect on ANF metabolism or renal bioactivity. However, ACE inhibition and ANF combined may interact to increase activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system by unknown mechanisms.\r"

The fractional excretions of sodium and lithium were measured simultaneously. In agreement with previous studies, we found that countertransport in erythrocytes was elevated in hypertensive patients compared with normal subjects. We also observed that whites have a higher level of countertransport than blacks. In the basal state, we found that fractional sodium excretion of hypertensive patients was no different than in normal subjects, whereas the fractional lithium excretion of hypertensive persons was increased compared with normotensive values. Volume expansion with 2 1 0.9% saline administered intravenously during a 4-hour period provoked an exaggerated natriuresis and a greater increase in fractional lithium clearance in hypertensive patients compared with the control group. With volume expansion and contraction, fractional lithium clearance and countertransport were directly correlated. Our data suggest that hypertensive persons do not have increased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption compared with normal subjects. Further, the exaggerated natriuresis of hypertension is, in part, the result of increased distal solute delivery. The fact that our hypertensive patients were older may partially explain the discrepancies between this report and previous observations.\r"

Regression analysis revealed no correlation between the increase in plasma ANH at 30 min and the increase in either right atrial or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 15 min (r = 0.46; P = 0.16 for right atrial pressure; r = 0.02; P = 0.96 for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). In the 5 men studied for 90 min, right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures returned to basal values by 45 min. In contrast, plasma ANH levels remained significantly elevated at all sampling times from 30-90 min (P less than 0.001); the peak value occurred at 75 min. We conclude that ANH secretion persists after saline infusion and that the cause of this prolonged secretion is not atrial stretch.\r"

The maximum specific binding of [125I]EGF to the BPH membrane fraction was achieved after 30-min incubation at 35 C. Analysis of the binding data revealed two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity [Kd, 2.5 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE) x 10(-11) mol/L] and one of lower affinity (2.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9) mol/L). [125I]EGF binding was inhibited by excess EGF, but not by insulin, proinsulin, fibroblast growth factor, or insulin-like growth factors I and II. In prostatic tissue of men with BPH treated for 3 months with the GnRH agonist analog Goserelin (Zoladex, depot formulation), the binding capacities of both sites were significantly higher than those of BPH tissue from untreated men (P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that prostatic tissue from men with BPH contains two classes of specific binding sites for EGF, and their levels are modulated by chronic GnRH agonists treatment.\r"

In this study we examined the distribution of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein in the two major subsets of T lymphocytes (T helper and T suppressor cells) and the effect of the hormone on their respective rates of proliferation. We activated normal lymphocytes in the presence of monocytes with phytohemagglutinin and subsequently isolated the T helper (T4-positive) and the T suppressor (T8-positive) subsets using monoclonal antibodies and complement-mediated lysis. In parallel experiments, we first isolated monocyte-depleted T4 and T8 cells and then activated them using phytohemagglutinin and a phorbol ester. Using either approach we found that both T4 and T8 lymphocytes expressed the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein upon activation. The concentration of this protein, its affinity for the ligand (Kd, approximately 10(-10) mol/L), and its sedimentation characteristics (S = 3.3) were indistinguishable in the two T cell subsets. Furthermore, the time kinetics of expression of the receptor after activation were very similar in the two subsets. Nevertheless, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the rate of proliferation of the helper subset, but had no effect on the proliferation of suppressor cells. The finding of a dissimilar effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the proliferation of the T helper and T suppressor cells despite their indistinguishable receptor status suggests that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors of the T cells might not be involved in the effects of the hormone on T-cell proliferation, and that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of mitogen-activated T4 cell proliferation could be mediated indirectly.\r"

This anti-serum (anti-4.6.3 ID) was rendered specific for KIM 4.6.3 idiotype (4.6.3 ID) by absorption with normal human IgM and IgG. The specificity of anti-4.6.3 was shown by its ability to bind to KIM 4.6.3 antibody but not to normal human IgM and IgG, by inhibition of anti-4.6.3 ID reactivity with KIM 4.6.3 antibody by the homologous monoclonal antibody and by the ability of anti-4.6.3 ID to inhibit the binding of single stranded DNA with KIM 4.6.3 antibody. The 4.6.3 ID was found to be commonly expressed since it was detected among 33% (10/30) DNA and 32% (23/72) non-DNA-reactive monoclonal antibodies that were obtained from five different unrelated normal individuals. The binding to ssDNA of the majority of idiotype positive anti-DNA antibodies however was not blocked by anti-4.6.3 ID suggesting that among these other monoclonal antibodies its expression is outside of the antigen binding site. The 4.6.3 ID, which was present among some normal-derived monoclonal IgM molecules was also found at a high frequency (90%) in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but only at a low frequency (24%) and concentration in normal sera. The level of 4.6.3 ID in SLE did not correlate with serum IgM and IgG nor with anti-DNA antibody concentrations. Idiotypic relatedness between SLE serum antibodies and monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies of normals implies the existence of a cross-reactive idiotype family and implies that a conserved common gene or closely related genes exist in the germ line encoding these 4.6.3 ID positive antibodies some of which are not exclusively associated with nucleic acid reactivity. The expression of these germ line genes in vivo thus distinguishes SLE from normals.\r"

Antigens identified in schistosome extracts by sera from immunized animals were then evaluated for protective potential. Immunization with schistosomal antigens of 97 and 68-70 kD resulted in significant protection that was equivalent to that obtained by FT schistosomula. Since the 97-kD antigen was suggested to be parasite paramyosin, we used a biochemical technique to purify this muscle protein. Purified schistosome paramyosin ran as a single band on 10% SDS-PAGE and was recognized both by sera from mice immunized with FT schistosomula and a polyclonal antiserum raised against the 97-kD parasite protein. Preincubation of schistosome paramyosin with sera from mice immunized with FT schistosomula resulted in the removal of reactivity with the 97-kD protein in crude worm extracts. Paramyosin was identified by Western blotting to be in the tegument of schistosomula. The purified schistosome paramyosin resulted in significant protection in three separate experiments (24, 46, and 53%) without the use of adjuvant. Addition of BCG to paramyosin resulted in enhanced protection.\r"

  ".W": "Recent work has demonstrated that apo E secretion and accumulation increase in the regenerating peripheral nerve. The fact that apoE, in conjunction with apoA-I and LDL receptors, participates in a well-established lipid transfer system raised the possibility that apoE is also involved in lipid transport in the injured nerve. In the present study of the crushed rat sciatic nerve, a combination of techniques was used to trace the cellular associations of apoE, apoA-I, and the LDL receptor during nerve repair and to determine the distribution of lipid at each stage. After a crush injury, as axons died and Schwann cells reabsorbed myelin, resident and monocyte-derived macrophages produced large quantities of apoE distal to the injury site. As axons regenerated in the first week, their tips contained a high concentration of LDL receptors. After axon regeneration, apoE and apoA-I began to accumulate distal to the injury site and macrophages became increasingly cholesterol-loaded. As remyelination began in the second and third weeks after injury, Schwann cells exhausted their cholesterol stores, then displayed increased LDL receptors. Depletion of macrophage cholesterol stores followed over the next several weeks. During this stage of regeneration, apoE and apoA-I were present in the extracellular matrix as components of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Our results demonstrate that the regenerating peripheral nerve possesses the components of a cholesterol transfer mechanism, and the sequence of events suggests that this mechanism supplies the cholesterol required for rapid membrane biogenesis during axon regeneration and remyelination.\r"

PTH mRNA levels increased about twofold in the rats made slightly hypocalcemic by infusion of calcium-free solution and decreased slightly in those made hypercalcemic by CaCl2 infusion (120-150 mumol/h) compared with the levels present in nonfasting control rats. Infusion of calcitonin (0.5 U/h) or EGTA (90 mumol/h) with calcium-free solution increased PTH mRNA levels further (two- to sevenfold) above the levels present in animals infused with calcium-free solution alone. These changes in PTH mRNA levels were observed after 48- but not 24-h infusion, and there was an inverse correlation between PTH mRNA levels and serum calcium concentrations. The results suggest that changes in serum calcium concentrations in the near physiological range regulate the biosynthesis of PTH by affecting steady-state levels of PTH mRNA when hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia continues for a relatively long period.\r"

Osmotic stretch of isolated atrial myocytes as well as potassium chloride depolarization were potent stimuli of atriopeptin secretion. Release was potentiated by buffering either extracellular calcium with EGTA or intracellular calcium with the intracellular chelator, BAPTA AM. Atrial release of atriopeptin was inhibited after administration of ionomycin which elevates intracellular calcium. Fetal or early neonatal ventricular myocytes actively synthesize atriopeptin. Atriopeptin secretion by ventricular myocytes was also markedly potentiated by osmotic stretch as well as KCl depolarization. Only the 126 amino acid prohormone was secreted by the stretch-stimulated atrial and ventricular myocyte. These data suggest that stretch of the myocyte plasma membrane is a major stimulus for atriopeptin secretion and that atriopeptin secretion is not stimulated by raising intracellular calcium and appears to be negatively modulated by this cation. Like the atrial myocyte, the ventricular myocyte possesses the cellular mechanism(s) necessary to secrete atriopeptin by a regulated mechanism.\r"

Cohen, Z. Fuks, and I. Vlodavsky. 1984. Nature (Lond.). 310:241-243; Savion, N., Z. Fuks, and I. Vlodavsky. 1984. J. Cell. Physiol. 118:169-176; Fridman, R., O. Lider, Y. Naparstek, Z. Fuks, I.

We found previously that heparin molecules inhibited expression of T lymphocyte heparanase activity in vitro and in vivo, and administration of a low dose of heparin in mice inhibited lymphocyte traffic and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (Lider, O., J. Mekori, I. Vlodavsky, E. Baharav, Y. Naparstek, and I. R. Cohen, manuscript submitted for publication). We now report that treatment with commercial or chemically modified heparins at relatively low doses once daily (5 micrograms for mice and 20 micrograms for rats) led to inhibition of allograft rejection and the experimental autoimmune diseases adjuvant arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Higher doses of the heparins were less effective. The ability of chemically modified heparins to inhibit these immune reactions was associated with their ability to inhibit expression of T lymphocyte heparanase. There was no relationship to anticoagulant activity. Thus heparins devoid of anticoagulant activity can be effective in regulating immune reactions when used at appropriate doses.\r"

  ".U": "89155814\r", 
  ".W": "To characterize homing receptors that are responsible for the recognition and specific binding of hemopoietic progenitor cells to the stroma, we synthesized and 125I-labeled a number of neoglycoproteins. We used these neoglycoproteins as ligand to detect receptors on the membrane of two cloned murine hemopoietic progenitor cell lines, B6SUT and FDCP-1. Both cell lines demonstrated membrane receptors with galactosyl and mannosyl, but not fucosyl, specificities. B6SUT galactosyl receptors showed a single receptor population with a Kd of about 2.3 X 10(-7) M and 10(6) receptors per cell. Mannosyl receptors demonstrated two components with high and low affinities respectively with Kd of about 2.5 X 10(-8) M and 1.0 X 10(-7) M, and respectively about 7.4 X 10(5) and 3.7 X 10(5) receptors per cell. Comparable data were also obtained for FDCP-1. Displacement experiments indicated that radioactive ligands bound to receptors could be increasingly displaced by homologous cold ligand giving typical sigmoid-shaped curves. Cold mannosyl probe could also displace radioactive galactosyl probe in a similar manner, but cold galactosyl probe displaced radioactive mannosyl ligand with a curve demonstrating two phases, further suggesting two receptor components for the mannosyl ligand. Mature murine neutrophils and red cells as well as human neutrophils, monocytes, and red cells showed no receptors. The functional significance of these receptors in binding to stromal cells was demonstrated by quantitation of the binding of 51Cr-labeled progenitor cells to the cloned stromal cell line, D2X, before and after enzymatic removal of various carbohydrate residues of membrane glycoconjugates. Enzymatic removal of galactosyl and mannosyl, but not fucosyl, residues almost totally eliminated the binding. The findings strongly suggest that these homing receptors are present on the surface of early hemopoietic progenitor cells. With maturation the cells lose their receptors, so that mature cells can be released into the blood stream.\r"

Antiidiotype (31-3B6) was generated in rabbits using a protective murine monoclonal antibody 31-3B6 which recognizes a 68,000-D molecular mass glycoprotein present in extracts of Schistosomiasis mansoni adult worm homogenetics. Immunization of mice with antiidiotype (31-3B6) before S. mansoni cercariae infection resulted in protection levels ranging from 16 to 41% depending on the route of administration of antiidiotypic antibody and the use of adjuvant. Levels of protection as high as 25% could be obtained with a single injection of antiidiotype (31-3B6) without the use of adjuvant. Animals noted to be resistant to infection with S. mansoni cercariae were also noted to exhibit a humoral immune response that bound components of S. mansoni adult worm homogenetics. This induced antiantigen immune response was shown to bind to the surface of S. mansoni schistosoma by indirect immunofluorescence. Further characterization of the induced antiantigen response showed that a portion (3-32%) of the induced humoral immune response portrayed the binding specificities of the murine monoclonal antibody 31-3B6. The data indicate that antiidiotype antibodies generated utilizing defined monoclonal antibodies can act as surrogate antigens in the protection of infection in schistosomiasis.\r"

Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is the primary eicosanoid product of neutrophils and is felt to be a mediator of host defense and inflammation. We investigated the in vitro effects of LPS on neutrophil production of LTB4 and the omega-oxidation metabolites of LTB4. Incubation of neutrophils with LPS in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 ng/ml did not result in production of LTB4 or metabolites in the absence of a second stimulus. Priming neutrophils with LPS and then stimulating with opsonized zymosan, phorbol-myristate-acetate or a low concentration of the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in enhanced production of LTB4. LPS priming of neutrophils occurred in a concentration dependent manner. LPS did not result in LTB4 production in response to the chemoattractant peptide FMLP. LPS priming of neutrophils had no effect on cytosolic calcium concentrations of resting or zymosan-stimulated cells. These results suggest that LPS might effect host defense and tissue injury by potentiating the effect of other stimulants on neutrophil production of LTB4. This LPS induced enhancement may represent an important pathogenetic pathway in patients with gram negative sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the physiological role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), we infused synthetic alpha-human ANF in seven such patients, and investigated the physiological correlates to circulating peptide levels in 24 patients with COLD. ANF infusion, at incremental rates of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 micrograms/kg.min, increased basal plasma immunoreactive (ir) ANF (136 +/- 38 pg/ml) by 3-, 10-, and 26-fold, respectively, and reduced pulmonary artery pressure (from 33 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) and systemic arterial pressure (from 88 +/- 4 to 79 +/- 4 mmHg, P less than 0.001) in a dose-related fashion. Cardiac index increased by 13.5% (P less than 0.01) while heart rate was unchanged. Cardiac filling pressures decreased at 0.1 micrograms/kg.min ANF. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance fell by 37% (P less than 0.001) and 19% (P less than 0.001), respectively. Arterial oxygenation was impaired during ANF infusion, suggesting partial reversal of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Plasma renin activity remained unchanged but aldosterone fell by 44% (P less than 0.01). The levels of plasma irANF in 24 patients correlated directly with the degree of hemoconcentration (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001), respiratory acidosis (r = -0.65, P less than 0.001), and pulmonary hypertension (r = 0.52, P less than 0.01). The results suggest that ANF may serve as a potent pulmonary vasodilator involved in the circulatory homeostasis of patients with COLD.\r"

The distribution of the pI values for both kappa and lambda type proteins was bimodal, most falling in the ranges 5.0-6.0 and 7.0-7.5. Plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance and the urine excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin and beta-2-microglobulin were measured in 24 of the patients. These patients, who were free of additional factors known to have an association with the development of renal impairment, were followed up for a mean period of 16 months (range three to 28 months). It was found that renal impairment was not related to the pI of the Bence-Jones protein excreted.\r"

Of 46 case control pairs, 11 cases but only one control had raised acute phase protein concentrations simultaneously (p less than 0.01); four case control pairs were excluded because of an infectious complication following infarction and an acute phase response. Seven of the 11 patients (64%) with raised acute phase protein concentrations had a history of bacterial infection in the preceding month but of the remaining 35 patients without raised concentrations only four (11%) had such a history (p less than 0.01). In general, the acute phase response was less pronounced and occurred less often than has been reported in patients after acute myocardial infarction. The results suggest that a positive acute phase response is associated with a preceding bacterial infection or with an infectious complication after cerebral infarction. Measurement of acute phase proteins, therefore, could be used to evaluate the possible role of preceding bacterial infection in the development of cerebral infarction and also in the management of these patients as an early indicator of possible infectious complications.\r"

A clear difference in response rate in all three antibody classes between patients with gonorrhoea and healthy controls was evident. Among women with gonorrhoea, the magnitude of antibody response was higher than among men with gonorrhoea, especially in the IgM class. No major differences were found in the overall distribution of serological findings between women with uncomplicated gonorrhoea and those with gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease. Among this last group, however, high IgM antibody levels in acute phase sera were significantly associated with the isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the upper genital tract.\r"

Six patients acquired primary T gondii infection, most probably from the donor organ. Five patients experienced T gondii recrudescence, two of whom had recovered from primary infection a few years earlier. Two patients died from primary T gondii infection and the severity of symptoms in the other patients with primary infection was related to the amount of immunosuppressive treatment. Prophylaxis with pyrimethamine (25 mg a day for six weeks) was introduced for T gondii antibody negative transplant recipients who received a heart from a T gondii antibody positive donor after the first four cases of primary toxoplasmosis. Of the seven patients not given pyrimethamine, four (57%) acquired primary T gondii infection. This compared with two of the 14 patients (14%) given prophylaxis.\r"

The preparative regimens (including high-dose chemoradiotherapy), as well as infections, medications, and graft-versus-host disease, result in nutritional complications. In order to determine foodservice needs, hospital personnel tabulated the foods requested and the daily number of meals ordered by 205 MT patients the final 14 days before their initial post-transplant hospital discharge. Oral and total (oral plus parenteral) caloric intakes were calculated from weighted food intake records using a computerized nutrient database. Per patient meal orders increased from 2.6 +/- 2.2 (SD) to 5.3 +/- 2.0 per day, and the mean number of items per day increased from 4.9 +/- 4.9 to 12.4 +/- 4.9, 14 days vs. 1 day prior to discharge. Beverages were the most frequently requested item, followed by bread products and cooked fruits and vegetables. Patients consumed approximately 60% of total calories from oral intake 1 day prior to discharge. The foodservice must be designed to provide a variety of foods served at frequent intervals to meet the needs of MT patients and thereby reduce dependence on parenteral nutrition.\r"

  ".W": "The use of a screening test for thyroid functional disorder by sensitive thyroid stimulating hormone assay in the elderly was investigated. The basal thyroid stimulating hormone levels predicted the response of thyroid stimulating hormone to thyrotropin releasing hormone; it was suppressed in 99 (99.0%) of 100 hyperthyroid patients. Therefore, not only primary hypothyroidism but also hyperthyroidism can be excluded when the serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels are normal. An epidemiological study was then performed on 2,421 (76.7%) of the Japanese general population aged 40 or over recruited from the residents in Hisayama town and also in 122 residents between 20 and 40 years of age. Additional free T4 measurement was necessary in about 10% of the residents with abnormal TSH levels to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or distinguish latent from overt hypothyroidism. There was a significant correlation between age and serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels after logarithmic conversion (r = 0.1533, P less than .001). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction found in 1,026 males and in 1,395 females aged 40 or over was, respectively: hyperthyroidism, less than 0.1% and 0.2%, latent (subclinical) hypothyroidism, 3.2% and 5.5%, and overt hypothyroidism, 0.4% and 0.7%. We conclude that the screening with this sensitive thyroid stimulating hormone assay and additional free T4 measurement is useful for detection of patients with thyroid functional disorder.\r"

We review this and other reports on potentially fatal cimetidine-related cardiac conduction disturbances to suggest that in patients at risk, in addition to reducing cimetidine dosage, electrocardiogram (ECG) follow-up is indicated to identify dangerous bradycardia and QT interval prolongation.\r"
