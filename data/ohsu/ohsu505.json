  ".W": "Twenty-two patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were given total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after the operation. The TPN contained either a conventional amino acid solution supplemented with glutamine or a conventional amino acid solution without supplementation. To study amino acid and protein metabolism, muscle biopsy specimens were taken before surgery and on the third postoperative day. The postoperative decrease in the intracellular concentration of free glutamine was less pronounced in the glutamine group (21.8 +/- 5.5%) than in the control group (38.7 +/- 5.1%; p less than 0.05). The protein synthesis was reflected in the concentration and size distribution of ribosomes. No significant changes in these parameters were seen in the glutamine group after the operation. In the control group, the total concentration of ribosomes fell by 27.2 +/- 8.5% (p less than 0.05), and the relative proportion of polyribosomes fell by 10.6 +/- 2.9% (p less than 0.01). Although there were significant changes in the control group, no significant differences in the changes of these parameters between the two groups were detected. The cumulative nitrogen loss was significantly less in the glutamine group as compared to the control group during the period studied--2.3 +/- 1.4 g versus 8.5 +/- 1.5 g, respectively (p less than 0.01). Administration of glutamine to catabolic patients is advocated.\r"

The study group consisted of 22 patients with distal fractures of the lower leg. Each patient was given IPC treatment on five consecutive days for 75 minutes daily. The control group consisted of 12 patients with lower leg fractures who were not given any treatment. Ankle joint mobility in the study group increased by 11.9 degrees (SE = 1.5), but by only 1.0 degree (SE = 0.8) in the control group. The difference is highly significant (p less than 0.001). The study group also experienced markedly greater pain relief than did the control patients. The reduction of edema was 170 ml (SE = 23) in the study group and only 15 ml (SE = 12) in the control group (p less than 0.001). This study suggests that IPC treatment promotes the rehabilitation of the posttraumatic conditions.\r"

Since polyamine biosynthesis is associated with cellular growth and differentiation, it may be important in this regenerative process. Our aim was to determine the effect of eflorithine (difluoromethylornithine), a specific inhibitor of polyamine synthesis, on intestinal regeneration. Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits had 2 x 5-cm ileal defects patched with adjacent cecal serosal surface. One half of the animals took 2% eflorithine in drinking water postoperatively. Six animals in each group were killed 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after patching. There was no significant difference in neomucosal growth at any time. Villous height, disaccharidase activity, and crypt cell production were significantly lower in the eflorithine-treated animals. Eflorithine-treated animals had significantly lower ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels. Despite the inhibitory effect of eflorithine on polyamine synthesis and proliferative activity, epithelialization and contraction of the patched defect were not affected. These findings suggest that polyamine synthesis is important in proliferation and differentiation of cells in the neomucosa but does not influence cell migration in intestinal regeneration.\r"

Biologically active IL-1 was detected in lysates of IL-1-treated rat and human fibroblasts that had been isolated from synovial tissue by collagenase digestion. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from these cells revealed the expression of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta transcripts. Neither the IL-1 transcripts nor the biologic activity of IL-1 was found in untreated synovial fibroblasts. The messenger RNA induction in synovial cells was followed by a time- and dose-dependent expression of intracellular IL-1 activity. Human monocytes and human skin fibroblasts also responded to IL-1 treatment by producing IL-1-specific transcripts. These observations suggest that IL-1 plays a key role in stimulating immune and inflammatory responses and in sustaining those responses through continued production at sites of inflammation.\r"

Ventilation during submaximal exercise was similar in the heart transplant group and the controls. The heart-lung group had an increased ventilatory response associated with lower end tidal carbon dioxide concentrations. Exercise capacity after combined heart-lung transplantation is similar to that after cardiac transplantation. Transplant recipients have an abnormal heart rate response during exercise related to cardiac denervation. The altered ventilatory response in heart-lung recipients may be the result of pulmonary denervation.\r"

Goserelin (Zoladex, ICI), a depot synthetic analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was administered by three consecutive 4-weekly injections. Plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) fell from 34 (SD 11) i.u./l to 2.4 (SD 1.9) i.u./l, and plasma concentrations of FSH fell from 106 (SD 29) i.u./l to 4.5 (SD 2.6) i.u./l 4 weeks after the first injection. Plasma concentrations of gonadotrophins returned to pretreatment values in every patient within 9 weeks of the final injection of goserelin. Regular ultrasonography during the period following the final injection failed to demonstrate the development of ovarian follicles in any patient, and plasma concentrations of oestradiol remained below 100 pmol/l. This study has failed to show that suppression of gonadotrophin secretion reverses premature ovarian failure.\r"

Oestrogen levels were markedly reduced in all patients during treatment. At the end of treatment the mean volume reductions were 44.4% (SEM 3.5) for total uterine volume and 57.3% (SEM 7.4) for volume of discrete fibroids as assessed ultrasonically. There was also marked improvement in associated symptoms. After buserelin therapy was stopped, the total uterine and discrete fibroid volumes returned to, or slightly exceeded, pretreatment volumes within 6 months in five patients, and by 12 months in two patients. Three other patients who underwent surgery for their fibroids during the first 4 months after treatment showed regrowth of fibroids to pretreatment size. Four comparable asymptomatic untreated patients showed no significant change in the total uterine or fibroid volume during six monthly ultrasonic assessments. Buserelin therapy may facilitate rather than replace surgery in the management of uterine fibroids.\r"

  ".W": "PADGEM protein (PADGEM), also known as GMP140, is a platelet alpha-granule membrane protein that is translocated to the external membrane after platelet activation. Although the biosynthesis of this protein was originally thought to be confined to megakaryocytes, the synthesis of PADGEM in endothelial cells was recently demonstrated (McEver et al: Blood 70:1974a, 1987). We now describe the subcellular localization of this protein in endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized human umbilical vein endothelial cells with KC4, a well characterized monoclonal antibody to PADGEM, showed positively stained elongated structures similar in distribution and shape to Weibel-Palade bodies. Their identity as Weibel-Palade bodies was confirmed by double label immunofluorescence using KC4 and a polyclonal antiserum to von Willebrand factor (vWf), a protein known to be specifically stored in these organelles. All Weibel-Palade bodies were found to contain PADGEM. In contrast to strong perinuclear staining produced with anti-vWf antibodies, no significant perinuclear staining was obtained with KC4, indicating that relatively little PADGEM is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. In endothelial cells treated with secretagogues that stimulate vWf release the elongated structures positive for PADGEM disappeared, further identifying these structures as Weibel-Palade bodies. This observation extends the parallels between Weibel-Palade bodies and alpha-granules and suggests a possible functional association between vWf and PADGEM.\r"

  ".U": "89194355\r", 
  ".W": "Bone marrow-derived stromal cell monolayers pretreated with recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibit the growth of hematopoietic cells. This was demonstrated by inhibition of fresh bone marrow-derived, IL-3-induced soft agar colonies as well as by inhibition of proliferation of IL-3-dependent cell lines and of a Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemic cell line. Pretreatment of stromal cells with IL-4 for five to seven days induced the inhibitory activity. IL-4 could then be removed before \"plating\" the bone marrow cells in soft agar, indicating that the inhibitory activity did not depend on the action of IL-4 on the precursors of the soft agar colonies. The inhibitory activity appears to be mediated by a soluble factor since inhibition was achieved even if the stromal cell layer was separated from the colony forming cells by an \"empty\" agar layer. However, supernatants of IL-4-induced stromal cell layers had no detectable inhibitory activity. The inhibitory action of the IL-4-pretreated stromal cell lines was not the result of killing of the precursor cells since it could be reversed if the agar layer containing the colony-forming cells was removed from the stromal cell layer and cultured with IL-3. Hydrocortisone (HC) blocked the inhibitory effect if added either in the IL-4 preincubation phase or during the colony formation stage, implying that HC blocked both induction of the inhibitory activity and its release or its effector function. A homogenous long-term stromal cell line could not be induced to exert the inhibitory activity; partial inhibition could be achieved with pure macrophages stimulated with IL-4 and CSF-1, suggesting that the inhibitory activity induced by IL-4 in mixed stromal cell layers may depend on a complex mechanism involving more than one cell type. Northern analysis of RNA from IL-4-induced and uninduced stromal cells indicated that IL-4 did not upregulate expression of CSF-1 or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and only modestly increased expression of tumor necrosis factor, suggesting that these cytokines were not responsible for the inhibitory activity. The capacity of IL-4 to induce inhibitory activity in stromal cell layers suggests that IL-4 may play a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolysis with single and combined four-hour intravenous (IV) infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator of 54,000 molecular weight (mol wt) (rscu-PA), and rscu-PA-32 kD, an rscu-PA derivative of 32,000 mol wt was studied in a femoral vein thrombosis model in the dog and in a jugular vein thrombosis model in the rabbit. In both species, the dose-response curves were linear, and no systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system or fibrinogen breakdown was observed. The steady-state levels of rt-PA-, rscu-PA-, and rscu-PA-32 kD-related antigens in plasma were proportional to the infusion rates. In the dog model, 25% lysis was obtained with 0.11 mg/kg rt-PA, 0.8 mg/kg rscu-PA, and 0.37 mg/kg rscu-PA-32 kD. Combinations of rt-PA and rscu-PA were 2.6 times more active (P less than .005) than anticipated on the basis of their pharmacologic additive effects, whereas combinations of rt-PA and rscu-PA-32 kD were 2.7 times more active (P less than .05). In the rabbit model, 25% lysis was obtained with 0.24 mg/kg rt-PA, 0.75 mg/kg rscu-PA, and 1.25 mg/kg rscu-PA-32 kD. Combinations of rt-PA and rscu-PA have a fivefold synergistic interaction, but surprisingly no synergism was observed between rt-PA and rscu-PA-32 kD. This study shows that synergism between rt-PA and rscu-PA occurs both in rabbits and dogs in a relatively narrow concentration range that allows a fractional reduction of the total equipotent dose by a factor of 2.5-fold to fivefold. Combination therapy is not associated with systemic fibrinolytic activation. This range of synergistic interaction, although limited, may be useful in devising the best thrombolytic therapy for patients with thromboembolic disease.\r"

To assess the potential importance of platelet aggregation in the thrombolytic response to plasminogen activators, we measured rates of thrombolysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator in the presence and absence of a coinfusion of prostaglandin E1 in a rabbit jugular vein model of thrombosis. Rates of lysis were quantified by measuring the half-time for lysis of the thrombus. At all concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator used, prostaglandin E1 markedly reduced the half-time for clot lysis and enhanced somewhat the overall extent of thrombolysis, without affecting significantly either the degree of fibrinogen depletion or the animals' mean arterial pressures. These effects on thrombolytic efficacy were accompanied by ex vivo evidence of platelet inhibition. These data suggest that the antiplatelet prostaglandin E1 may be a very useful adjunctive agent in thrombolytic therapy primarily by virtue of the significant improvement in the rate of thrombolysis that its use affords.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we examine the effects of amino acid deprivation on the growth and differentiation of the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line. The HL-60 cell line was chosen for study because of its ability to differentiate along either a granulocytic or monocytic pathway under appropriate culture conditions. Differentiation was determined by changes in cell morphology, nonspecific esterase (NSE) content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and expression of the cell surface differentiation antigens LeuM3 (CD14) and OKM1 (CD11). Using a model system in which HL-60 cells were cultured in medium that selectively lacked one amino acid (AA), it was seen that deprivation of HL-60 cells for essential (but not nonessential) AAs results in decreased cell growth and viability and in differentiation of 30% to 60% of the surviving population of cells specifically along the monocytic pathway. This differentiation is irreversible as well as time- and dose-dependent. Culture of HL-60 cells in essential AA-deficient medium potentiated the differentiative effects of recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), all of which have previously been shown to induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Differentiated cells had decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, but protein synthesis was unchanged compared with control cells. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented differentiation, indicating the necessity of protein synthesis in this process. Cell cycle analysis revealed that an increased proportion of cells cultured in AA-deficient medium was arrested in G0-G1 (80% and 50% for AA-deficient and control cells, respectively). These results suggest that alterations of AA metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA and RNA synthesis may be important in initiating differentiation or in augmenting cytokine-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into more mature, nonreplicating, monocyte-like cells.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA II) or HEMPAS is a genetic disease caused by plasma membrane abnormality. The enzymic defect of HEMPAS has been suggested to be the lowered activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, resulting in lack of polylactosamine formation on proteins and leading to accumulation of polylactosaminyl lipids. In contrast to typical HEMPAS cases, cell-surface labeling of the erythrocytes of a HEMPAS variant G.K. showed an absence of polylactosamines either on proteins or on lipids. Fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis of G.K.'s erythrocyte glycopeptides detected a series of high mannose-type oligosaccharides, which were not detected in erythrocyte N-glycans of normal cells or of other HEMPAS cases: The former contains polylactosaminoglycans and the latter contains hybrid-type oligosaccharides. Keratansulfate (sulfated polylactosamines) in this patient's serum was abnormally low. The galactosyltransferase activity in microsomal membranes prepared from G.K.'s mononucleated cells was 24% of the normal level, whereas this enzyme activity in G.K.'s serum was comparatively higher than normal. Western blotting of G.K.'s membranes using antigalactosyltransferase antibodies showed that G.K. has reduced amounts of this enzyme present. The results collectively suggest that variant G.K. is defective in polylactosamine synthesis owing to the decreased quantity of the membrane-bound form of galactosyltransferase.\r"

After T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplantation (TD-BMT), these cells have an activated pattern of target cell killing; they also secrete lymphokines including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and may have a significant role as a primary defense against viral reactivation and in the elimination of residual host malignancy. We studied 43 patients with hematologic malignancy, treated by allogeneic TD-BMT, autologous nondepleted BMT, or chemotherapy alone to investigate (a) the mechanisms underlying the generation of these activated killer cells, (b) the range of conditions under which they are produced, and (c) their surface phenotype. We showed that gamma-IFN-secreting activated killer cells with the capacity to kill MHC-nonidentical NK-resistant targets are generated 4 to 6 weeks after either allogeneic TD-BMT or autologous BMT but do not appear after treatment with chemotherapy. Production therefore is not owing to T-cell depletion per se or to host donor alloreactivity, nor is it caused by stimulation by alloantigens contained in blood product support since no significant difference exists between allograft and chemotherapy patients in the number of units of blood platelet support given in the posttreatment period. Because most patients had no evidence of stimulation from virus reactivation/infection, the phenomenon of activation therefore appears to represent posttransplant immune disregulation following repopulation of the host immune system with lymphoid subsets derived exclusively from blood and marrow. Activated killing is predominantly mediated by the CD16+ CD3- subset, but substantial activity remains in the CD16- CD3+ cell fraction. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that block interaction with class-I MHC molecules at the level of target cell (W6/32 anti-HLA class I) or effector cell (CD8) do not inhibit killing by CD16- CD3+ cells. Activated killer cells may contribute to the lower risk of relapse after marrow transplantation as compared with intensive chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the prevalence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in all patients attending a London sexually transmitted disease clinic over four weeks at the end of 1987 and to see how it varied from that in similar samples studied between 1982 and 1986. DESIGN--Anonymous testing of serum samples from consecutive heterosexual and homosexual patients having routine serological investigations for syphilis. Testing was for anti-HIV-I, anti-HIV-II, and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and P24 antigen. Age, nationality, sexual orientation, and past sexually transmitted diseases were recorded for each patient. Gonorrhoea rates by quarters were analysed among homosexual and bisexual men and heterosexual men and women from 1981 to 1987. SETTING--Outpatient department of genitourinary medicine. PATIENTS--A total of 1074 patients attending consecutively for syphilis serology. Thirty five homosexual and bisexual men were excluded (these were regular attenders as part of a prospective study of the natural course of HIV infection). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--The prevalence of anti-HIV-I in homosexual and bisexual men in 1987 was 25.6% (64/250). Results in the same clinic population between 1982 and 1984 had shown a rise in prevalence, which flattened out in 1985-6 and continued at that level. Among heterosexual attenders in 1987 the prevalence of anti-HIV-I was 1% (women 4/412; men 4/377), which contrasted with a prevalence of 0.5% (women 2/395; men 3/757) in January 1986. One homosexual man was seropositive for anti-HIV-II and seronegative for anti-HIV-I. Among homosexual and bisexual men the rate of gonorrhoea had declined by an average of 2.7% a year since 1981, such that by 1987--and for the first time in the clinic--there was no significant difference in the rates between these men and heterosexual men and women. CONCLUSIONS--The appearance of HIV-I infection among heterosexuals indicates a need for more aggressive education programmes and intervention strategies along the lines adopted for homosexual men. Surveillance for HIV-II infection is needed to provide information for future policy in national screening programmes.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial after a single blind run in period of placebo treatment for one month. SETTING--One hundred and forty seven outpatient clinics in 14 countries. PATIENTS--Total of 3899 patients over 40 years old who had had documented intermittent claudication for at least two months and in whom the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle to that in the arm was less than or equal to 0.85 in both arteries of at least one foot. INTERVENTION--After the one month placebo run in period patients were randomly allocated to take 20 mg ketanserin three times daily for the first month and 40 mg three times daily thereafter or to take the same number of placebo tablets. Five months after the onset of the trial, on the recommendation of the ethical and safety committee, four patients stopped taking ketanserin and two stopped taking placebo because they had a corrected QT interval greater than 500 ms. Four months later the committee recommended that all patients taking diuretics should stop receiving trial treatment (167 of those taking ketanserin and 144 of those taking placebo). END POINT--The first primary event after randomisation. Primary events were definite myocardial infarction, major stroke, amputation above the ankle, excision of ischaemic viscera, and death due to other vascular causes. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--There were 136 study end points in the 1930 patients treated with ketanserin, who were followed up for 2063 patient years, and 132 study end points in the 1969 patients treated with placebo, who were followed up for 2129 patient years. A harmful interaction of ketanserin and potassium losing diuretics resulted in an increase in the number of deaths. After patients taking potassium losing diuretics or antiarrhythmic agents were excluded [corrected] a secondary analysis showed that there were 65 end points in 1514 patients taking ketanserin and 87 in 1557 patients taking placebo, a reduction of 23% in the number of study end points in those taking ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS--Ketanserin can prolong the corrected QT interval, and the combined use of ketanserin and potassium losing diuretics can be harmful. A secondary analysis suggested a protective effect of ketanserin against cardiovascular complications in patients with claudication.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised controlled trial. SETTING--General practice in inner London. PATIENTS--All 3206 men and women aged 30-64 registered with the practice. INTERVENTION--The intervention group had their risk factors ascertained and followed up by the health promotion nurse and the general practitioner, whereas those in the control group were managed by the general practitioner alone. END POINT--Recording and follow up of blood pressure and cervical smears after three years. Recording of smoking, family history of ischaemic heart disease, and serum cholesterol concentrations were also examined. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--When the trial was stopped after two years the measurements of blood pressure in the preceding five years were 93% (1511/1620) v 73% (1160/1586) (95% confidence interval for difference 17.5 to 22.7%) for intervention and control groups respectively. For patients with hypertension the figures were 97% (104/107) v 69% (80/116) (18.2 to 38.2%). For women the proportion who had had a cervical smear in the preceding three years were 76% (606/799) v 49% (392/806) (22.5 to 31.9%). Recording of smoking, family history of ischaemic heart disease, and serum cholesterol concentrations was also higher in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSION--An organised programme, which includes a nurse with specific responsibility for adult prevention, is likely to make an important contribution to recording of risk factors and follow up of those patients with known risks.\r"

Independent odds ratios for death above the median age for the year of death (calculated for years from 1974, when regions of residence were coded by regional health authority area) were 1.47 (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.87) in male compared with female patients and 2.75 (2.16 to 3.52) in non-manual compared with manual social classes. The independent odds of death at above the median age also varied significantly among regions of residence by a ratio of up to 2.67. Social class, sex, and region of residence are all potential determinants of survival of patients with cystic fibrosis. Social class is particularly likely to confound the effect of management in specialist centres on survival.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether insulin dependent diabetics with microalbuminuria have significant abnormalities in concentrations of lipoproteins, apolipoproteins AI and B, fibrinogen, and clotting factor VII which could result in increased cardiovascular risk. DESIGN--Case-control study. SETTING--Outpatient department of a metabolic ward. PATIENTS--Group of 20 insulin dependent diabetics with urinary albumin excretion rates greater than 30 micrograms/min (microalbuminuria) and 20 individually matched insulin dependent diabetics with normal urinary albumin excretion rates (below 30 micrograms/min) matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. INTERVENTIONS--Fasting venous blood samples were taken for determination of concentrations of glucose, glycated haemoglobin, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins AI and B, fibrinogen, and factor VII. Height, weight, arterial pressure, and usual insulin dose were recorded, and each patient was given a dietary questionnaire to be completed at home. END POINT--Comparison of blood pressure and concentrations of lipoproteins, apolipoproteins AI and B, and fibrinogen in the diabetics with microalbuminuria and the controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Patients with microalbuminuria had significantly higher concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean 3.33 (SE 0.20) v 2.84 (0.12) mmol/l) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.30 (0.05) v 0.17 (0.03) mmol/l) than controls but significantly lower concentrations of high density lipoprotein 2 subfraction cholesterol (0.32 (0.04) v 0.54 (0.04) mmol/l). Concentrations of total triglyceride (1.11 (0.14) v 0.68 (0.08) mmol/l), very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (0.56 (0.10) v 0.30 (0.05) mmol/l), apolipoprotein B (0.88 (0.06) v 0.67 (0.03) g/l) and fibrinogen (2.2 (0.1) v 1.9 (0.1) g/l), and diastolic arterial pressure (80 (2) v 74 (2) mm Hg), were also higher in patients with microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS--Cardiovascular risk factors--namely, disturbances in lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations, increased fibrinogen concentration, and increased arterial pressure--are already present in insulin dependent diabetics with microalbuminuria. The increased risk of coronary heart disease in patients with clinical proteinuria may result from prolonged exposure to these risk factors, which are present before any impairment of renal function.\r"

Questionnaires were sent to 32 transplant centres representing 18 health regions and covered their extent of experience of transplantation, sources of donors, ages of donors and recipients, outcome of transplantation, and views on expansion of living donor transplantation services. Replies received from 27 transplant centres representing 17 health regions gave data on more than 1200 transplants from living donors. Transplants from living donors accounted for 0-25% of the total experience of health regions. Two centres had abandoned living donor transplantation. Sixty per cent of transplant surgeons favoured expansion of the living donor programme to meet a shortage of kidneys from cadavers, and the remainder thought that existing programmes were optimal. Living donor transplantation promises to be an important factor in the future planning of health care resources.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised crossover trial. SETTING--Academic department of therapeutics. SUBJECTS--Twenty healthy male volunteers aged 19-22. INTERVENTIONS--On separate occasions and in randomised order all subjects received aspirin 75 mg, warfarin, or aspirin 75 mg combined with warfarin. Each treatment was given for 12 days or (when warfarin was used) for longer if necessary until the international normalised ratio of the prothrombin time was stable at 1.4-1.6. END POINT--Loss of blood over 10 minutes into gastric washings. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Bleeding over 10 minutes into gastric washings under baseline conditions and after five days, and at end of each regimen of treatment. Aspirin 75 mg increased bleeding from 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.99) microliters/10 minutes to 1.26 (0.71 to 2.25) microliters/10 minutes at five days, with no evidence of either progressive change or adaptation thereafter. Warfarin had no effect on bleeding either alone or when combined with aspirin. CONCLUSIONS--Aspirin 75 mg causes gastric mucosal bleeding. Low dose warfarin neither induces gastric mucosal bleeding nor enhances that caused by aspirin.\r"

Real differences may have been swamped by random variations in the small numbers of referrals. The statistical power of the studies may not have been high enough to determine which factors were significant in describing the variation and how much of the variation was due to differing clinical practice. There remains a substantial part of the variation that cannot be accounted for.\r"

Prophylaxis for the close contacts of 10 out of 11 of the remaining index patients failed to fulfil all the criteria of an optimal regimen.

SETTING--Oxford Regional Health Authority area (population 2.4 million). PATIENTS--All patients with insulin dependent diabetes diagnosed below age 21 during 1985-6 and resident in the region at the time of diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS--None. END POINT--Validation of a method of case ascertainment for assessing temporal variation in incidence of insulin dependent diabetes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--The overall yearly incidence of newly diagnosed insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in people under 21 was 15.6 cases/100,000 (95% confidence interval 13.6 to 17.6). Among males the incidence was 16.8 cases (14.0 to 19.7)/100,000 and among females 14.3 cases (11.6 to 17.1)/100,000. The highest incidence, in the 10-14 year age group, was 26.4 (20.9 to 31.8) new cases/100,000 population yearly. Case ascertainment was greater than 95%. CONCLUSIONS--The incidence of insulin dependent diabetes in England is considerably higher than reported from large scale studies. It is consistent with described patterns of geographical variation. The figures provide a baseline for assessing temporal change.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the long term effects of short term intravenous infusions of iloprost with those of oral nifedipine in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon associated with systemic sclerosis. DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised group comparison. SETTING--Dermatology outpatient clinic. PATIENTS--Twenty three patients with Raynaud's phenomenon associated with well documented systemic sclerosis (American Rheumatism Association criteria) and with typical abnormalities in fingernail folds on capillaroscopy. INTERVENTIONS--Twelve patients were randomised to receive intravenous infusions of iloprost starting at 0.5 ng/kg/min and increased by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 15 minutes to a maximum of 2.0 ng/kg/min for eight hours on three consecutive days with a further single infusion at week 8. Placebo capsules were given concurrently. Eleven patients were randomised to receive nifedipine, starting at 30 mg daily and increased to 60 mg daily after four weeks for another 12 weeks. Infusions of placebo were given in the same manner as the infusions of iloprost. One patient from each group withdrew because of social reasons and three patients receiving nifedipine withdrew because of side effects. END POINT--Reduction in number, duration, and severity of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon, reduction in number of digital lesions, increase in digital blood flow. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Measurements were taken at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Both regimens produced a reduction in the number, duration, and severity of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon. The mean (SE) number of digital lesions was reduced with iloprost (from 3.5 (1.6) to 0.6 (0.3] and with nifedipine (from 4.3 (0.8) to 1.4 (0.5] after 16 weeks. Hand temperature and digital and microcirculatory blood flow were increased with iloprost but not with nifedipine. CONCLUSION--Both iloprost and nifedipine are beneficial in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. With nifedipine, however, side effects are common. Short term infusions of iloprost provide longlasting relief of symptoms, and side effects occur only during the infusions and are dose dependent.\r"

  ".W": "In national samples of 9921 10 year olds and 3259 adults in Britain systolic blood pressure was inversely related to birth weight. The association was independent of gestational age and may therefore be attributed to reduced fetal growth. This suggests that the intrauterine environment influences blood pressure during adult life. It is further evidence that the geographical differences in average blood pressure and mortality from cardiovascular disease in Britain partly reflect past differences in the intrauterine environment. Within England and Wales 10 year olds living in areas with high cardiovascular mortality were shorter and had higher resting pulse rates than those living in other areas. Their mothers were also shorter and had higher diastolic blood pressures. This suggests that there are persisting geographical differences in the childhood environment that predispose to differences in cardiovascular mortality.\r"

The combined use of hyperthermia and IFN was compared with hyperthermia and with IFN alone. The combined use of hyperthermia and IFN-alpha was shown to have significant anti-tumour effects compared with the former or latter alone. Of 10 nude mice (10 implanted tumours) used for the experiment, 5 showed complete disappearance of the implanted tumours and the others showed prolongation of survival. Combined treatment with IFN-gamma and hyperthermia showed no significant effect when compared with other treatment groups. Combined treatment with local hyperthermia and IFN-alpha may have some application to the clinical management of renal carcinoma.\r"

Nine malnourished patients were given both conventional TPN containing 19 per cent BCAA (AA) and isocaloric, isonitrogenous TPN containing 50 per cent BCAA (BCAA-TPN), in random order. Both [13C]leucine and [14C]tyrosine were employed as tracers to avoid the potential bias due to the different amino acid composition of the two TPN solutions. With BCAA-TPN, leucine and tyrosine flux increased significantly from (mean +/- s.d.) 158.0 +/- 37.2 to 243.5 +/- 75.8 mumol kg-1 h-1 (P less than 0.025) and from 35.0 +/- 8.4 to 42.6 +/- 11.0 mumol kg-1 h-1 (P less than 0.05) respectively. Leucine oxidation was significantly higher on BCAA-TPN (24.1 +/- 6.3 on AA versus 68.3 +/- 37.1 mumol kg-1 h-1, P less than 0.025) while tyrosine oxidation was significantly lower (3.7 +/- 1.8 mumol kg-1 h-1 on AA versus 2.5 +/- 2.0 mumol kg-1 h-1 on BCAA-TPN, P less than 0.05). Whole body protein synthesis and breakdown was significantly higher on BCAA-TPN by the tyrosine tracer (31.3 +/- 7.3 on AA versus 40.1 +/- 9.3 mumol kg-1 h-1, P less than 0.025 and 33.0 +/- 8.4 on AA versus 41.3 +/- 11.1 mumol kg-1 h-1, P less than 0.05) respectively. Using the leucine tracers both synthesis and breakdown were increased, but not significantly, from 133.8 +/- 40.0 to 175.3 +/- 65.1 mumol kg-1 h-1 and from 127.9 +/- 33.6 to 167.7 +/- 71.2 mumol kg-1 h-1 respectively. The fractional albumin synthetic rate increased significantly on BCAA-TPN from 4.3 +/- 2.9 on AA to 8.0 +/- 5.1 per cent per day (P less than 0.05). The reduction in tyrosine oxidation, suggesting improved protein utilization, coupled with an increase in protein and albumin synthesis, strongly support a positive benefit from BCAA-TPN in cancer cachexia.\r"

The applicability of such a scheme to clinical practice has been investigated in a large animal model of diabetes: the pancreatectomized dog. Eight dogs with previously established renal allografts and immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A received islet allografts from their respective original kidney donors. The median islet graft functional survival was only 10.5 days, significantly less than for six similarly immunosuppressed dogs receiving islet allografts alone (48.5 days, P less than 0.05). Three of the sequentially transplanted dogs had had no renal graft rejection episodes before islet transplantation, yet their islet grafts were all rejected within 19 days. In the pancreatectomized dog, prior donor specific renal transplantation has an adverse effect upon subsequent islet graft survival.\r"

  ".W": "When response rates to antineoplastic therapy are good and the associated nutritional morbidity is high, TPN is recommended when the gastrointestinal tract is unavailable for use. Patients should not be denied adequate cancer treatment because of the fear of complications secondary to malnutrition. On the other hand, prolongation of pain and suffering for the terminally ill cancer patient is obviously not an indication for TPN. Appropriate clinical judgment is required in proper selection of the TPN candidate. Malnutrition is almost always a prerequisite, as is failure of the gastrointestinal tract. Therapies designed to direct nutritional support to preferentially benefit the host and \"starve\" the tumor have had only limited short-term success in animal models. The use of diets that are glutamine- and arginine-supplemented are only now being examined in animal experiments. Since TPN allows total and complete control of exogenous nutrients, it should be used to explore alternative therapies in the form of nutrient composition. For example, if tumors are preferential glutamine utilizers, then TPN-enriched solutions might be employed to increase the number of cells in a phase of mitosis that makes them more susceptible to attack by cell-cycle specific chemotherapeutic agents. Stimulation of tumor growth by TPN in patients is not scientifically documented. Only anecdotal reports appear in the literature. Thousands of cancer patients worldwide have received TPN. Were stimulation of tumor growth to be a major problem with TPN solutions as currently formulated, it should be known by now.\r"

The black church has been identified as a means of promoting health issues and intervention programs. The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a colorectal cancer prevention and screening program in community black churches. A total of 1,488 Coloscreen III kits were distributed, and a telephone survey was conducted to examine the demographic profile, attitudes, and behaviors of those who returned the kit (17.5 percent) compared with those who did not (82.5 percent). The survey revealed that the majority of both returners and nonreturners felt that the test could detect bowel cancer and that early detection could result in cure. The returners were significantly older and less likely to smoke. The low response was attributed primarily to the test's dietary requirements. Both groups reportedly made changes in their lifestyles as a result of the educational component of the program--that is, they increased their fiber intake and decreased their fat intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Even with the low response of this study, educational benefits were evident. If colorectal cancer screening programs in community black churches are to be effective, however, diet-related issues must be addressed.\r"

Mucosal erythroplasia rather than leukoplakia is the earliest visual sign of oral and pharyngeal carcinomas. 4. Areas of mucosal abnormality, especially redness or inflammation in high-risk sites, that persist for more than 14 days without obvious etiology or resolution should be biopsied. 5. Asymptomatic, erythroplastic lesions should not be regarded merely as precancerous changes. The evidence indicates that these lesions in high-risk sites should be considered to be invasive carcinoma or at the very least carcinoma in situ, unless proven otherwise by biopsy. 6. Toluidine blue staining is a useful diagnostic adjunct, particularly as a method of ruling out false-negative clinical impressions. It may also be used as a screening rinse in high-risk patients to encompass the entire oral mucosa after a negative clinical examination and as a guide to improve biopsy yields. 7. If oral or pharyngeal cancer is identified, evaluations of the larynx, hypopharynx, esophagus, and lungs should be performed to rule out second primary cancers. Yearly aerodigestive surveillance should be continued after satisfactory treatment of the index cancer.\r"

The results of both tests were correlated with clinical outcome and all available information from biopsy, autopsy, and additional cell marker studies. When the diagnoses by both cytologic analysis and KLA were in agreement (57.1% of cases), there were no false-negative or false-positive results. Overall, false-positive and false-negative rates were, respectively, 6.1% and 12.2% with cytologic study, and 4.1% and 4.1% with KLA. Sixteen samples were from patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and small cleaved lymphoma, which had a false-negative rate of 37.5% by cytologic study, and only 6.2% by KLA. There was one false-positive result by KLA among the benign effusions. These findings indicate that KLA is a powerful adjunct to the cytologic evaluation of lymphocyte-rich effusions, especially in cases of lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by small lymphocytes, in which the cytologic diagnosis is frequently difficult.\r"

From 1972 to 1976, 26 patients were treated with a relatively short course of radical RT alone: 52-55 Gy/16 Fx/4 wk (study 1). From 1977 to 1982, 29 patients were also treated with radical RT alone, but with a more prolonged fractionation schedule: 65-70 Gy/26-28 Fx/6.5-7 wk (study 2). In 1983, the policy was to combine CT and RT. From 1983 to 1987, 22 patients received four to six courses of CMU regimen (consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and UFT, a 5-fluorouracil analog) after completion of radical RT (study 3). The three studies were comparable with regard to patient characteristics: histologic type, stage, sex, and age distribution. There were no significant differences in survival and relapse figures between study 1 and study 2, but study 3 compared favorably with study 1 and study 2 in actuarial survival, relapse-free survival, relapse rate, and median relapse time. A mild nausea and transient granulocytopenia during CT was the only side effect encountered. In conclusion, the use of CT in combination with RT appeared to increase significantly the chance of long-term survival and probable cure.\r"

For the studies we used the subrenal capsule (SRC) assay and 15 human gastric cancer tissues. The TS levels were assayed by the ligand-binding technique, using [6-3H]FdUMP. The relative variation of tumor size (delta TuS/TuS0) was calculated to be as follows: delta TuS/TuS0 = [(TuS6 - TuS0)/TuS0] x 100 (%), where TuS6 was the tumor size on day 6 and TuS0 on day 0. The chemosensitivity was considered to be positive when delta TuS/TuS0 in the treated group decreased to below -10%. Decrease in tumor size was marked in case of exposure to UFT (-19.8 +/- 13.0%) (mean +/- standard deviation), compared with that to 5-FU (-9.0 +/- 7.2%), with a statistically significant difference (P less than 0.001). The TS level varied from 1.7 to 30.8 pmol/g gastric cancer tissue and the mean was 7.1 +/- 7.2 pmol/g tissue. A correlation was noted between the TS level and decrease in size of the tumor exposed to 5-FU (r = -0.671) or UFT (r = -0.758): gastric cancer tissue with higher level of TS is more sensitive to 5-FU and UFT than is that with a lower TS level. These findings show that the sensitivity to 5-FU and UFT of gastric cancer tissue is related to the TS level and that UFT shows promise for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer.\r"

Single intraperitoneal (IP) injections of ethylnitrosourea (ENU) at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight (BW) were given to the animals of two groups on days 15 and 21 of pregnancy, respectively. The progeny of a third group received by subcutaneous injection (SC) the same dose of ENU, 15 mg/kg BW, on day 1 postnatally. The descendants of the fourth group served as untreated controls. The most striking findings were observed in the progeny of the mothers treated on day 15 of pregnancy, in which group 64 of 180 descendants developed peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, 30% of which had plexiform pattern. One hundred fifteen of the 180 descendants developed central nervous system (CNS) gliomas, mainly oligodendrogliomas, and five animals presented with Wilms' tumors. No tumors of these types were observed in the untreated controls. Although descendants of mothers treated on day 21 of pregnancy had the highest number of PNS tumors (130 of 172 animals), only 21% of these tumors were plexiform; CNS gliomas were observed in 78 animals and Wilm's tumors in one animal. The lowest percentage of PNS tumors with plexiform pattern (16%) was found in the group of 157 descendants treated postnatally on day 1, in which 88 animals developed PNS tumors, 76 developed CNS gliomas, and no animals developed Wilms' tumors. The higher percentage of plexiform PNS tumors found in the descendants treated prenatally on day 15 of pregnancy was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) when compared with the percentage found in the group treated postnatally. This significance was also valid for the plexiform tumors that developed selectively from branches of the trigeminal nerves (of the PNS tumors from this location, 48% showed a plexiform pattern), but only in the progeny exposed to ENU on day 15 of pregnancy. This same progeny also had the highest numbers of CNS and Wilms' tumors. Because in humans, plexiform neurofibromas are considered to be the neoplastic markers of neurofibromatosis, and CNS gliomas as well as Wilms' tumors are associated with this disease, it is suggested that exposure to ENU on day 15 of pregnancy, under the experimental conditions described here, may offer a model for investigating tumors associated with neurofibromatosis, as well as aspects of the spontaneous, noninherited forms of this disease.\r"

The diagnosis of HD rested upon the presence of systemic lymphadenopathy, the typical histologic pattern and reactivity of Reed-Sternberg cells with the LeuM1-CD15 monoclonal antibody. The two diseases developed independently, in the absence of any immunosuppressive treatment. Furthermore, there was some evidence suggesting that HD tissue was not responsible for the production of the incomplete gamma chain. This and similar cases may provide a model for a better understanding of the events leading to the simultaneous outgrowth of two lymphoid neoplasias in the same patient.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of acute hypoxia (respiration gas 12%, 10%, and 8% O2 and asphyxia, respectively) on 1) the density of perfused capillaries and muscle fibers, and 2) the capillary red cell distribution was investigated in the left heart of anesthetized rats. To observe capillaries and fibers, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (FITC)-gamma-globulin and lissamine-rhodamine-B200-labeled (RB200) myoglobin were injected intravenously as labels of the perfused intravasal and the extracellular space, respectively. The hypoxic conditions were induced subsequently and maintained for 3 minutes. After this period the heart was rapidly frozen for histological demonstration of the dyes. Ventilation with 12% or 10% O2 did not induce any changes in the density of perfused capillaries; however, 8% O2 in respiration gas did lead to a significant increase (capillaries/mm2: subepicardium, 4,180, controls, 3,620; subendocardium, 3,930, controls, 3,240). A similar increase was found in the asphyxia group (capillaries/mm2: subepicardium, 4,170; subendocardium, 3,700). The increases in the density of perfused capillaries were paralleled by rises in fiber density. This leads to the conclusion that the changes in capillary counts were caused by fiber elongation with a resultant decrease in intercapillary distances. This assumption was supported by observations that there were no signs of changes in ventricular segment length during respiration of 12% or 10% O2 but that an increase did occur with 8% oxygen and with asphyxia. Densities of perfused capillaries exactly coincided with anatomical densities (demonstrated by additional labeling of capillary basement membranes with isolectin B4) in normoxic and asphyctic hearts. The distribution of red cells in the capillaries, determined in histological sections, did not differ appreciably under hypoxia due to reduced O2 in respiration air (12%) or asphyxia. The results obtained indicate that 1) extreme hypoxic states cause the capillaries to move closer to each other due to elongation of myocardial fibers and 2) red cell distribution is not altered during these conditions.\r"

  ".U": "89195618\r", 
  ".W": "Release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) following an elevation in heart rate is thought to be mediated primarily by a change in atrial stretch. To evaluate the direct effect of chronotropic stimulation on ANF release, isolated rat left atria were electrically paced (1-9 Hz) at constant resting tension (0.5-4 g), and the amount of immunoreactive ANF (IRANF) released at each frequency and tension was quantitated with a sensitive radioimmunoassay. Our results show that at controlled resting tensions greater than 1 g, chronotropic stimulation increased IRANF secretion in a manner dependent on the pacing frequency; rapid atrial rates (e.g., 8 and 9 Hz) were necessary to release ANF at tensions of 1 g or less. Resting tension influenced the magnitude of the secretory response to electrical stimulation. Release of IRANF with contraction frequency was transient in nature and, at high frequencies, was associated with a decrease in developed (systolic) tension in accordance with the negative force-frequency relation inherent in the rat heart. When evaluated at a single diastolic tension and pacing frequency, IRANF release was positively correlated with systolic tension. ANF released under in vitro conditions was approximately 3,000 Da, in agreement with the size of the physiologically circulating form. In atria from reserpinized rats, evidence for involvement of catecholamines in chronotropic-stimulated ANF release was suggested. The presence of lidocaine (5 x 10(-4) M) had no effect on rate-induced ANF secretion. Therefore, chronotropic stimulation releases ANF independently of changes in atrial stretch. The magnitude of this response depends on a combination of pacing frequency and diastolic tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were given 40 mg/kg of the elastase inhibitor SC-39026 in a carboxymethylcellulose vehicle or vehicle only by gavage, 12 hours before and twice daily for 8 days after a single subcutaneous injection of either monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline. Thirteen days after injection, indwelling cardiovascular catheters were inserted under pentobarbital anesthesia, and at 15 days after injection, pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded with the animals awake. At post-mortem examination, the lungs were perfused and morphometric techniques applied for light and electron microscopic evaluation. Saline-injected rats given either SC-39026 or vehicle were similar in all features assessed. In contrast, monocrotaline-injected rats given SC-39026 had significantly lower mean pulmonary artery pressure than those given vehicle (21.0 +/- 1.6 vs. 27.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and this correlated with a significant reduction in the number of abnormally muscularized arteries at alveolar wall level (r2 = 0.89, p less than 0.001). SC-39026 did not significantly reduce monocrotaline-induced medial hypertrophy of muscular arteries, endothelial injury, and associated subendothelial edema; nor was there a significant increase in the proportion of the medial elastin, although a trend was apparent. Additional groups of monocrotaline injected rats were followed 3 weeks after injection, but both SC-39026 and vehicle-treated rats were similar at this point. Our data suggest that increased serine elastase activity associated with endothelial injury may mediate early abnormal pulmonary vascular smooth muscle differentiation resulting in muscularization of normally nonmuscular peripheral arteries and pulmonary hypertension induced in rats by injection of the toxin monocrotaline. Lack of persistence of this protective effect suggests that there may be continued elastase activity in this model. Failure to inhibit medial hypertrophy with SC-39026 suggests that a different mechanism or a different elastase may be involved in this structural change.\r"

The subjects included four poor hydroxylators of debrisoquin and three poor hydroxylators of mephenytoin. There was a correlation between the total plasma clearance of diazepam and demethyldiazepam (rs = 0.83; p less than 0.01). There was no relationship between benzodiazepine disposition and debrisoquin hydroxylation. Poor hydroxylators of mephenytoin had less than half the plasma clearance of both diazepam (p = 0.0008) and demethyldiazepam (p = 0.0001) compared with extensive hydroxylators of mephenytoin. The plasma half-lives were longer in poor hydroxylators than they were in extensive hydroxylators of mephenytoin for both diazepam (88.3 +/- SD 17.2 and 40.8 +/- 14.0 hours; p = 0.0002) and demethyldiazepam (127.8 +/- 23.0 and 59.0 +/- 16.8 hours; p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in volume of distribution of the benzodiazepines between the phenotypes. This study shows that the metabolism of both diazepam (mainly demethylation) and demethyldiazepam (mainly hydroxylation) is related to the mephenytoin, but not to the debrisoquin, hydroxylation phenotype.\r"

The relationship between TUN and UUN was examined by linear regression, and analysis of covariance was used on log-transformed data to assess differences between the patient groups. Although there was a close relationship between UUN and TUN for the preoperative patients (r2 = .94, total range of differences = 3.85 g N), this was not as accurate in postoperative and stressed patients (r2 = .69 and .76, respectively, total range of differences = 16.8 and 10.7 g N, respectively). There was no significant difference between the slopes of the regression lines for the relationship between UUN and TUN for three groups (f = 1.1, df = 2114, p less than .3), but the intercepts of the regression lines differed between the preoperative and stressed patient groups (t = 3.47, v = 114, p less than .001). The relationship between TUN and UUN for the whole group was improved by the inclusion of the independent variables of both the patient's clinical state and the urinary creatinine excretion. Arm muscle circumference, which is an estimate of muscle mass, may replace creatinine excretion with little loss in prediction accuracy.\r"

Oxygen, CO2, and nitrous oxide concentrations were measured continuously with fast infrared and paramagnetic sensors as ventilation was decreased gradually in 12.5% increments at 5-min intervals. Samples for blood gas determinations were obtained at 3 min after each respirator adjustment. An increasing difference between inspiratory and end-tidal oxygen concentrations (FIO2 - PetO2) was the most sensitive indicator of hypoventilation and exceeded the sensitivity of end-tidal CO2. Decreasing PetO2 was followed by a decrease in PaO2, but no detectable change in arterial oxygen saturation until the ventilation was decreased to 37% of the initial value. The rapidly decreasing alveolar oxygen was replaced by nitrous oxide, and a sudden drop in ventilation was characterized by a change in the end-tidal values of all the three gases and peaked waveforms. Thus, PetO2 and FIO2 - PetO2 are sensitive and valuable indicators of adequate ventilation and appropriate oxygen supply.\r"

  ".U": "89196817\r", 
  ".W": "Concentration and voltage dependence of unidirectional magnesium fluxes across the rat descending colon were measured in a modified Ussing-chamber. Mucosa to serosa (ms) magnesium flux exhibits a saturable component, whereas serosa to mucosa (sm) flux is linearly related to the magnesium concentration from 0.125 to 8 mmol/L. At all the concentrations used, ms magnesium transport is higher than the flux in the opposite direction, resulting in net magnesium absorption. Only ms magnesium transport has a voltage-independent, i.e., cellular-mediated component. Magnesium flux from serosa to mucosa, however, is totally voltage-dependent, i.e., purely diffusive and probably constrained to the paracellular pathway. The cellular-mediated fraction of ms magnesium transport is comparable to that found for calcium. Calcium (5 mmol/L) has no influence on ms flux or on the magnesium flux in the opposite direction. Magnesium (5 mmol/L) has no influence on the sm calcium flux but abolishes calcium absorption by decreasing ms calcium flux. The voltage clamp experiments reveal that magnesium has no influence on the cellular-mediated ms calcium transport but exclusively decreases diffusive calcium flux in this direction. Pretreatment with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (250 ng/kg s.c. daily given for 4 days) has no effect on ms magnesium flux but it remarkably stimulates ms calcium transport. These findings suggest that both earth alkaline ions in the descending colon are transported by separate cellular-mediated mechanisms. On the other hand, the similarity of the kinetic parameters as well as the similarity of the voltage-independent ms fluxes would support the assumption that both ions are absorbed by the same mechanism. Hence, the question of whether both ions are absorbed by the same or by distinct transport processes cannot be answered by the present experiments. Diffusive movement across the paracellular route plays an important role in net transport of both ions. Diffusive magnesium flux is equal in both directions. In contrast, for calcium an asymmetry in the paracellular fluxes with a prevalence of the diffusive sm flux over the diffusive fraction of the flux from mucosa to serosa has been reported. The different behavior with respect to the paracellular movement can be explained by the radius of the hydrated magnesium ion, which is smaller than calcium with its hydration shells.\r"

An acute inflammation with ulcers and neutrophil infiltration developed that evolved into a chronic inflammation and luminal narrowing with attendant smooth muscle hypertrophy. We assessed the effects of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, administered either before or after trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, on the development of inflammation. Inflammation was assessed by gross appearance using a grading scale (0-4) and by histology. The number of neutrophils present in inflamed colonic tissue was quantitated by the myeloperoxidase assay. The production of lipoxygenase products was monitored by incubation of colonic specimens with [14C]arachidonic acid and separation of the products by thin-layer chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Levels of leukotriene B4 were measured in tissue extracts by high-pressure liquid chromatography and ultraviolet absorbance. Eicosanoid production was also assayed by incubating colonic specimens and assaying the media for prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, and leukotriene C4 by radioimmunoassay. Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid treatment resulted in a greatly increased amount of leukotriene B4 in the media. Treatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 before administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid resulted in a lower inflammation index, lower myeloperoxidase activity, and decreased production of leukotriene B4. Administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 24 h after administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid was also effective in reducing the inflammatory response. Treatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 also prevented the development of long-term architectural changes 3 wk after administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Rectal administration of dimethyl prostaglandin E2 also diminished the colitis induced by direct injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid into the colonic wall.\r"

Blood coagulation was studied using standard techniques. In plasma of IBD patients significantly decreased tissue type plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) (p less than 0.02), increased plasminogen activator inhibition (PAI) (p less than 0.01) and fibrinogen (p less than 0.001), and prolonged thrombin time (p less than 0.001) and prothrombintime (p less than 0.001) were found. In colon mucosa the percentage of t-PA to urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was 80:20% in the control group and 71:29% in the IBD group in non-inflamed mucosa. In inflamed mucosa the plasminogen activator percentage was 55:45%, significantly different (p less than 0.01) from the control group. There was also a significant absolute increase in u-PA activity and decrease of t-PA activity in the inflamed mucosa compared to the control group (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease therefore have significant changes in components of the fibrinolytic and coagulation system both systemically and locally in colon mucosa. These changes might contribute to an increased risk for thromboembolic complications and possibly to the pathogenesis of the colitis and to the local complications such as bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The recent launch of a number of fibre enriched polymeric diet in the United States and Europe has stimulated considerable interest in the topic of fibre and enteral nutrition, and several commercial concerns appear to be under considerable pressures from their consumers to produce similar products. As a means of identifying areas of potential application of fibre to enteral nutrition some of the recent knowledge gained about the physical properties of dietary fibre and the processes involved in the intestinal assimilation of fibre has been reviewed. Two areas of interest are identifiable. The first relates to the bulking properties of fibre and the application of this to the regulation of bowel function in enterally fed patients. It is clear from the clinical studies that have been reviewed that there remains a paucity of controlled data, and a great deal more research is needed before widespread use of fibre supplemented diets can be supported. Perhaps of greater interest academically is the potentially beneficial effects that appear to be exerted by the VFA's, liberated as a consequence of colonic bacterial fermentation of fibre, on morphology and function of ileal and colonic mucosa. Although there are a number of potential applications of fibre supplemented enteral diets in this area, more research is required before any firm recommendations can be made about recommending their use. The one exception concerns patients with the nutritionally inadequate short bowel syndrome. There does seem to be sufficient experimental evidence to suggest that clinical studies should be commenced using a pectin supplemented predigested 'elemental' diet in these patients. Overall therefore, one is forced to conclude that the increasing interest and use of fibre supplemented enteral diets is being driven more by market than scientific forces. Nevertheless, the promotion of these diets has already provided a powerful stimulus to the scientific community, and it remains entirely possible that many of the potential applications of these diets will be realised in the near future.\r"

Specific antisera to each of the enzymes and to the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase were used to identify their distribution in the extracellular matrix of the growth plate and to determine the associated tissues and cells that are responsible for their synthesis. Immunolocalization using tissue that was cultured in the presence of monensin to augment accumulation of intracellular antigen revealed that the growth-plate chondrocyte is responsible for the synthesis of the metalloproteinases and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and that there is a unique pattern of synthesis in each zone. Chondrocytes of the resting and proximal proliferative zones were shown to synthesize and secrete all of the metalloproteinases and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. Synthesis of collagenase also was demonstrated in the remainder of the proliferative zone and in the most distal cells of the hypertrophic zone. The presence of collagenase in the distal cells suggests their involvement in vascular invasion. By culturing tissues in the presence of antibodies, we were able to demonstrate collagenase and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase throughout the growth-plate matrix. Staining of the extracellular matrix, implying active collagenase, was also found in the matrix of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, suggesting that degradation of tissue may occur at a distance from the cells that synthesize the enzyme. Simultaneous localization with two different antibodies demonstrated that growth-plate chondrocytes are capable of synthesizing collagenase and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, both independently of one another and coordinately. Stromelysin was found to be synthesized in all zones, implying that it plays an important role in degradation. Monocyte-conditioned media stimulates synthesis of collagenase in growth-plate cells, principally through the action of interleukin-1. All chondrocytes throughout the growth plate, including hypertrophic cells, can be stimulated to produce collagenase. These changes in metalloproteinase and in the tissue inhibitory of metalloproteinase in the growth plate are crucial to remodelling of the matrix during development, and the appearance of metalloproteinases and the tissue inhibitory of metalloproteinase in the secondary ossification center and groove of Ranvier indicates that changes at these sites are similar to remodeling in the growth plate. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The life cycle of the chondrocyte in the growth plate is central to the process of endochondral ossification, bone growth, and development.

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of menadione on porcine aortic endothelial cell prostaglandin synthesis. Addition of 1-20 microM menadione caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of stimulated prostaglandin synthesis with an IC50 of 5 microM at 15 min. Concentrations greater than 100 microM menadione were necessary to increase 51Cr release from prelabeled cells. Recovery of enzyme inactivated by menadione required a 6-h incubation in 1% serum. In a microsomal preparation, menadione was shown to have no direct effect on conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In intact cells menadione caused only a 40% inhibition of the conversion of PGH2 to prostacyclin. Enzymes involved in the incorporation and the release of arachidonic acid were not affected by menadione (20 microM, 15 min). Menadione undergoes oxidation/reduction reactions in intact cells leading to partial reduction of oxygen-forming, reactive oxygen species. In our cells menadione was found to increase KCN-resistant oxygen consumption. Further, an increased accumulation of H2O2 was observed with a time course consistent with menadione-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. We conclude that menadione at sublethal doses caused inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The mechanism involves inactivation of PGH2 synthase by a reactive species resulting from metabolism of menadione by endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) contributes to formation of the complicated human atherosclerotic plaque. These lesions also contain macrophages, known to secrete SMC mitogens, and T lymphocytes. Many of the SMC in the lesions express class II major histocompatibility antigens, an indication that activated T cells secrete immune IFN-gamma locally in the plaque. We therefore studied the effect of IFN-gamma on the proliferation of cultured SMC derived from adult human blood vessels. IFN-gamma (1,000 U/ml) reduced [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation into DNA by SMC stimulated with the well-defined mitogens IL 1 (from 15.3 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 0.7 dpm X 10(-3)/24 h) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (from 18.5 +/- 1.0 to 7.3 +/- 0.7 dpm X 10(-3)/24 h). Kinetic and nuclear labeling studies indicated that this effect of IFN-gamma was not due to altered thymidine transport or specific radioactivity of TdR in the cell. In longer term experiments (4-16 d) IFN-gamma prevented net DNA accumulation by SMC cultures stimulated by PDGF. IFN-gamma also delayed (from 30 to 60 min) the time to peak level of c-fos RNA in IL 1-treated SMC. It is unlikely that cytotoxicity caused these effects of IFN-gamma, as the inhibition of growth was reversible and we detected no cell death in SMC cultures exposed to this cytokine. Activation of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase gene expression may mediate certain antiproliferative and antiviral effects of interferons. Both IFN-gamma and type I IFNs (IFN-alpha or IFN-beta) induced 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA and enzyme activity in SMC cultures, but with concentration dependence and time course that may not account for all of IFN-gamma's cytostatic effect on SMC. The accumulation of SMC in human atherosclerotic lesions is a long-term process that must involve altered balance between growth stimulatory and inhibitory factors. The cytostatic effect of IFN-gamma on human SMC demonstrated here may influence this balance during human atherogenesis, because T cells present in the complicated atherosclerotic plaque likely produce this cytokine.\r"

To define the role of T cells in the successful host response to chemotherapy, we examined the efficacy of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate, Pentostam) in normal and T cell-deficient BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania donovani. In euthymic (nu/+) mice, single injections of 250 and 500 mg/kg of Pentostam induced the killing of 67% and 89% of intracellular liver amastigotes, respectively. In contrast, in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, up to three injections of 500 mg/kg achieved no L. donovani killing and did not retard visceral parasite replication. Once nude mice were reconstituted with nu/+ spleen cells, however, Pentostam exerted strong leishmanicidal activity, an effect that appeared to be transferred by either L3T4+ or Lyt-2+ cells. Responsiveness to chemotherapy could also be induced by providing nude mice with either interferon-gamma or interleukin 2 alone. The absence of this T cell- and probably lymphokine-dependent mechanism is a likely explanation for treatment failures in immunocompromised patients infected with L. donovani and perhaps other systemic intracellular pathogens as well.\r"

This biochemical defect causes a murine lysosomal storage disease that has many interesting similarities to human mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome; beta-glucuronidase deficiency). Genetic analysis showed that the mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive that maps to the beta-glucuronidase gene complex, [Gus], on the distal end of chromosome 5. Although there is a greater than 200-fold reduction in the beta-glucuronidase mRNA concentration in mutant tissues, Southern blot analysis failed to detect any abnormalities in the structural gene, Gus-sb, or in 17 kb of 5' flanking and 4 kb of 3' flanking sequences. Surprisingly, a sensitive S1 nuclease assay indicated that the relative level of kidney gusmps mRNA responded normally to androgen induction by increasing approximately 11-fold. Analysis of this mutant mouse may offer valuable information on the pathogenesis of human MPS VII and provide a useful system in which to study bone marrow transplantation and gene transfer methods of therapy.\r"

Results of heat denaturation of TBG established that the TBGA allele is X linked and has a frequency of 50.9% in Western Australian Aborigines. The sequence of an isolated TBGA allele differed at two positions from that of the normal TBG allele (TBGC). One substitution was in codon 191, ACA (threonine) rather than GCA (alanine), and the other was in codon 283, TTT (phenylalanine) instead of TTG (leucine). These nucleotide substitutions resulted in the loss of sites for the enzymes Bgl 1 and Tth 111 II, respectively. The nucleotide substitutions in the TBG-A allele was confirmed by digestion of genomic DNA segments amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The Bgl 1 and Tth 111 II sites were absent in the genes of two Aboriginal men expressing TBG-A and were present in those of three Aboriginal and six Caucasian males expressing TBG-C. The TBG gene of a seventh Caucasian male possessed the Bgl 1 site but had lost the Tth 111 II site; sequencing of this allele revealed only the substitution in codon 283 identical to that in the TBGA allele. As the biochemical properties of TBGPhe-283 expressed by this individual were indistinguishable from normal TBGLeu-283, we believe that the abnormal properties of TBG-A are due to substitution of alanine for threonine at residue 191.\r"

Southern hybridization analysis of the alpha-galactosidase gene in affected hemizygous males from 130 unrelated families with Fabry disease revealed six with different gene rearrangements and one with an exonic point mutation resulting in the obliteration of an Msp I restriction site. Five partial gene deletions were detected ranging in size from 0.4 to greater than 5.5 kb. Four of these deletions had breakpoints in intron 2, a region in the gene containing multiple Alu repeat sequences. A sixth genomic rearrangement was identified in which a region of about 8 kb, containing exons 2 through 6, was duplicated by a homologous, but unequal crossover event. The Msp I site obliteration, which mapped to exon 7, was detected in an affected hemizygote who had residual enzyme activity. Genomic amplification by the polymerase chain reaction and sequencing revealed that the obliteration resulted from a C to T transition at nucleotide 1066 in the coding sequence. This point mutation, the first identified in Fabry disease, resulted in an arginine356 to tryptophan356 substitution which altered the enzyme's kinetic and stability properties. The detection of these abnormalities provided for the precise identification of Fabry heterozygotes, thereby permitting molecular pedigree analysis in these families which revealed paternity exclusions and the first documented new mutations in this disease.\r"

The present study was designed to test whether PGE2 might mediate IFN gamma-dependent effects on CD8+ cells by altering the number and/or affinity of their IFN gamma receptors. CD8+ and CD4+ cells when cultured for 18 h expressed comparable numbers of IFN gamma receptors of a single high affinity. Incubation with 10(-8) M PGE2 for 18 h, however, increased the number of IFN gamma receptors on CD8+ cells without affecting the binding affinity. Similar effects were not observed with CD4+ cells, nor when CD8+ cells were cultured in 10(-8) M PGD2. Concentrations of PGE2, which were ineffective in the induction of IFN gamma-dependent suppressor cell differentiation, also did not affect IFN gamma receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This observation of a specific stimulatory effect of PGE2 on the display of IFN gamma receptors of CD8+ cells suggests a novel mechanism for eicosanoid function through tissue-specific regulation of hormone receptors.\r"

The left anterior descending coronary artery was distally occluded for 45 min and was reperfused for 3 days. Intracoronary infusion was started immediately before reperfusion and continued during 45 min of reperfusion. Infarct size was determined as the ratio of infarcted (tetrazolium stain) to ischemic myocardium (dye technique). Regional systolic shortening was assessed by sonomicrometry. Apart from left ventricular end-diastolic pressure before ischemia and during 45 min of reperfusion, global hemodynamic values in the five treatment groups did not differ; in particular, calculated left ventricular oxygen consumption before and during ischemia was equally low. Intracoronary EGTA decreased coronary venous free calcium concentration to about 70% of baseline value. Infarct size was reduced from 76 +/- 10% (control group, n = 8) to 60 +/- 10% (p less than 0.01) by intracoronary diltiazem (n = 8) and to 55 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) by intracoronary EGTA (n = 8). Insignificant reductions in infarct size were found after treatment with intracoronary verapamil (63 +/- 18%, n = 8) and intracoronary nifedipine (68 +/- 9%, n = 7). Regional systolic shortening of the risk region, which did not differ among the groups before occlusion and during ischemia, recovered to the greatest extent in the EGTA-treated pigs (p less than 0.01 compared with values in the control group). Treatment with intracoronary calcium antagonists resulted in only marginal improvement of systolic shortening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In open chest dogs, endothelial cell damage was produced in the left anterior descending coronary artery by external compression with blunt forceps, greater than 90% stenosis was obtained by an external constrictor and thrombosis was induced by instillation of thrombin and fresh blood in an isolated arterial segment. In the absence of stenosis, intravenous infusion of 750,000 U of streptokinase over 1 h caused reperfusion in five of six dogs in 34 +/- 25 min (mean +/- SD). Urokinase, 600,000 U intravenously over 30 min followed by 600,000 U over 30 min by the intracoronary route, induced reperfusion in three of four dogs in 65 +/- 23 min. Recombinant two chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (G11021), infused intravenously at a rate of 15 micrograms/kg per min for 30 min or until reflow, induced reperfusion in all 12 dogs in 28 +/- 13 min. In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, spontaneous reocclusion did not occur within 2 h after the end of the infusion. In the presence of the coronary artery constrictor, which reduced the blood flow to 40 +/- 10% of baseline, streptokinase, urokinase and rt-PA caused coronary thrombolysis to proceed at comparable or only slightly slower rates. Cyclical reocclusion during or after the end of infusion of these thrombolytic agents, caused by platelet-rich thrombus, was almost invariably observed, generally within 30 min after the onset of reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both CD45R- and CD45R+ T4 cells that had been treated with mitomycin C (CD45R- and CD45R+ T4-mito) provided help for the generation of Ig-secreting cells (ISC) in cultures stimulated by PWM or by immobilized mAb to CD3 (64.1). IL-2 enhanced the generation of ISC in PWM-stimulated cultures and in anti-CD3-stimulated cultures containing CD45R+ T4-mito. The generation of ISC was maximal in cultures containing anti-CD3-activated CD45R- T4-mito and was not increased by IL-2. By contrast, CD45R+ T4 cells that had not been treated with mitomycin C suppressed B cell responses in cultures stimulated with PWM or anti-CD3, whereas CD45R- T4 cells suppressed the generation of ISC only in cultures stimulated with anti-CD3. IL-2 enhanced suppression by anti-CD3, but not PWM, activated CD45R- T4 cells. Suppression by CD45R+ T4 cells was maximal and not increased by IL-2. CD45R+ T4-mito were more effective suppressor-inducers in PWM-stimulated cultures, promoting the differentiation of suppressor-effector cells from CD8+ T cells. However, both CD45R+ and CD45R- T4-mito exerted comparable suppressor-inducer function in anti-CD3-stimulated cultures. Moreover, in anti-CD3-stimulated cultures, T8 cells could function as both suppressor-effector cells and suppressor-inducer cells. One of the functions of suppressor-inducer cells in this system appeared to involve the production of IL-2. Thus, the addition of IL-2 facilitated the induction of suppressor-effector T8 cells by CD45R- T4-mito in PWM-stimulated cultures. Although IL-2 production by the T cell subsets varied widely depending on the nature of the stimulus, these differences could not entirely explain their capacity to function as helper cells, suppressor-effector cells or suppressor-inducer cells. These results indicate that both CD45R+ and CD45R- T4 cells can help or suppress B cell responses, as well as induce suppressor-effector T8 cells. Moreover, suppressor-inducer function of T cells is not limited to the T4 cell population, but rather can also be accomplished by T8 cells. The results indicate that both T4 cell subsets and T8 cells exert multiple regulatory effects on human B cell function, with the nature of the activating stimulus playing a major role in determining the functional capacity of various T cell subsets.\r"

The adult double-negative thymocytes showed significantly greater proliferation than fetal thymocytes after stimulation via anti-CD3 or anti-Thy-1 in the presence or absence of interleukins (IL-1 + IL-2 or IL-4). Adult CD4-, CD8- thymocytes also exhibited greater calcium mobilization following anti-CD3 stimulation IL-2-dependent activation with anti-Thy-1 or IL-1 + IL-2 in the absence of PMA resulted in marked expansion of CD 3+, F23.1+, CD4-, CD8- thymocytes, a population absent in fetal thymocytes but constituting 4% of pre-cultured CD4-, CD8- adult thymocytes. IL-4 + PMA failed to expand this CD 3+ population.

  ".W": "The role of Ca2+ in cell-mediated cytotoxicity has been the subject of many investigations and both Ca2+-dependent and -independent pathways have been reported. TNF was suggested to play a role in NK and macrophage cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We assumed that its role in target cell lysis might take place by a Ca2+-independent mechanism. This hypothesis was investigated in assays of rTNF-mediated lysis of tumor target cells. Extracellular Ca2+ depletion by the calcium chelator EGTA (2 mM and 5 mM) and blocking of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by 8-(diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride did not inhibit TNF-mediated tumor cell lysis. Furthermore, blocking of Ca2+ influx in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker Verapamil did not inhibit TNF-mediated tumor cell lysis. Previous reports showed that lysis of sensitive tumor cells by TNF is preceded by binding of TNF to TNF receptors, internalization, and DNA degradation. These events were tested in the absence of Ca2+. Treatment with Ca2+ inhibitors did not affect binding of 125I-TNF to target cells. Also TNF induced the fragmentation of cellular DNA in target cells without extracellular or intracellular Ca2+. These findings demonstrate that the mechanism of TNF-mediated tumor cell lysis does not depend on intracellular or extracellular Ca2+ and that events associated with target cell lysis can also function in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, our findings support the contention of a Ca2+-independent lytic pathway in which secreted or membrane-bound TNF may interact with the target cells and ultimately result in DNA degradation and target cell lysis.\r"

  ".U": "89198509\r", 
  ".W": "Intracerebral inoculation of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus results in an intense inflammatory response of mononuclear leukocytes which infiltrate into the central nervous system. Resistant strains of mice have the ability to clear virus whereas susceptible strains become infected persistently and are associated with chronic demyelination which is proposed to be immune-mediated. In an attempt to better understand the role of the immune response during demyelination, mononuclear leukocytes were isolated from the central nervous system of infected mice and stained by an immunoperoxidase technique with anti-Thy-1.2, anti-L3T4, anti-Lyt-2 and anti-MAC-1 mAb. Infection of susceptible SJL/J mice resulted in a biphasic immune response which peaked on days 7 and 27 post-infection. In contrast, a single peak (day 7) was observed in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. The presence of Thy-1.2, L3T4, and MAC-1+ cells was similar between the two strains. However, although the number of Lyt-2+ cells peaked on day 7 in C57BL/10SNJ mice, they were not detected in SJL/J mice until 14 days post-infection and gradually increased in number over the course of infection. To further study the role of T cells in demyelination, serial frozen sections of brain and spinal cord were stained for the presence of Lyt-2 and L3T4+ cells in the lesions of chronically infected SJL/J mice. L3T4+ cells were observed predominantly in perivascular regions while Lyt-2+ cells were observed infiltrating the parenchyma. These results provide further evidence that Lyt-2+ lymphocytes are important in the mechanism of susceptibility/resistance to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination.\r"

Here, surface expression of class I MHC and CD1, which represents a family of MHC-related molecules, was analyzed on various human immature and mature thymocyte subpopulations. Class I expression was inversely related to the expression of CD1. The majority of CD4+ CD8+ cortical type thymocytes expressed low levels of class I MHC Ag, the previously described CD4+ CD8+ thymocyte subpopulation with low CD8 expression exhibited intermediate levels of class I MHC, whereas most of the single positive CD4 and CD8 thymocytes displayed high levels of class I MHC. Biochemical comparison of CD1 and class I showed that thymic class I molecules were post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, whereas CD1 was not phosphorylated. Furthermore, our studies suggested that in addition to CD1/CD8 complexes, thymocytes bear CD8/class I complexes. Chemical cross-linking and peptide mapping studies clearly identified the CD8-associated protein on thymic clones as the class I MHC molecule.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously identified a group of early proteins preceding the expression of a 120-kDa protein (p120) which coincides with tumoricidal activation in peritoneal macrophages. In the present report, we have asked whether the in vitro induction of new or enhanced expression of p120 depends on early protein synthesis and RNA synthesis during the treatment period. Expression of p120 was sensitive to pretreatment of the macrophages with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, indicating that both active protein synthesis and RNA synthesis were required. When poly-adenylated RNA isolated from various macrophage populations was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system, only mRNA isolated from cells which express p120 was able to direct synthesis of a 120-kDa polypeptide. This product showed identical mobility to p120 induced in intact activated macrophages radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. The presence of translatable p120 mRNA was dependent upon treatment of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages with both IFN-gamma plus LPS at low doses, as is expression of p120 in intact cells. Accumulation of translatable p120 mRNA was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, indicating that active protein synthesis was required during the induction period. These results suggest that the presence of specific translatable mRNA encoding the p120 polypeptide is dependent upon the expression of early macrophage gene products.\r"

In this report we describe the properties and uses of a mAb, H57-597, produced from one of these animals. The mAb reacts with surface receptors on all alpha beta TCR-bearing cells and does not react with receptors on gamma delta+ T cells. In an immobilized form, this antibody can directly activate T cells bearing alpha beta TCR. It can be used in immunoprecipitation reactions to precipitate receptor from the appropriate cell types. In combination with anti-CD3, the antibody can be used in cytofluorographic analyses to measure numbers of CD3+, alpha beta+, and CD3+, gamma delta+ cells in the thymus and periphery.\r"

This study establishes a structure-function correlation responsible for the binding of Ig Fab regions to SPA. Binding of 24 isolated human monoclonal IgM proteins to SPA was measured in a solid phase RIA. VH and V kappa subgroups of each IgM were determined by SDS-PAGE, transfer blotting, and detection with antisera prepared against specific first framework region peptides. Binding to SPA was seen with 10 of 11 VHIII IgM, but none of the 7 VHI or 6 VHII. Similarly, polyclonal IgM fractionated on a SPA-Sepharose CL4B column showed nearly complete partition of VHIII molecules into the SPA-binding fraction, and VHI and VHII subgroup proteins into the fall-through. We conclude that SPA binding is a functional marker for VHIII H chains in human IgM molecules.\r"

Passively sensitized mast cells in the absence of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) released leukotriene (LT)C4, LTD4, PGD2, and thromboxane-B2 when challenged with Ag, and in the presence of AA, released 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 15-HETE in addition to the above metabolites. Passively sensitized macrophages did not release significant amounts of AA metabolites when challenged with Ag. However, these cells released LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, 5-HETE, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha when co-incubated with activated mast cells. During co-incubation, mast cells also generated greater amount of AA metabolites than when they were activated alone. The stimulatory action of mast cells on macrophages was shown to be due to the extracellular factor(s) present in the supernatant of the activated mast cells. Both heat and trypsin inhibited the biologic activity of mast cell-derived stimulatory factor. In addition, extraction of mast cells' materials with chloroform or ether showed no activity associated with the organic phase, suggesting it possibly possesses a protein nature, such as peptides, protease, or peptidase. These results suggest that mast cell-macrophage interaction might be important in the generation of multiple mediators in the airways during immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

MV-specific T cell responses were observed in 11 of 15 donors tested (stimulation index greater than 2), when optimal doses of UV-MV were used in proliferative assays. T cell clones were generated from PBMC of three donors responding to MV, by using either UV-MV or MV-infected autologous EBV-BC as APC. Stimulation with UV-MV generated exclusively CD3+ CD4+ CD8- MV-specific T cells, whereas after stimulation of PBMC with MV-infected EBV-BC, both CD3+ CD4+ CD8- and CD3+ CD4- CD8+ MV-specific T cell clones were obtained. Of 19 CD4+ T cell clones tested so far, 7 clones reacted specifically with purified fusion protein and 1 with purified hemagglutinin protein. Seven clones proliferated in response to the internal proteins of MV. Three clones reacted to whole virus but not to one of the purified proteins, whereas one clone seemed to recognize more than one polypeptide. Some of the T cell clones, generated from in vitro stimulation of PBMC with UV-MV, failed to recognize MV Ag when MV-infected EBV-BC were used as APC instead of UV-MV and PBMC. CD3+ CD4+ CD8- T cell clones recognized MV in association with HLA class II Ag (HLA-DQ or -DR), and most of them displayed CTL activity to autologous MV-infected EBV-BC. All CD4+ HLA class II-restricted CTL clones thus far tested were capable of assisting B lymphocytes for the production of MV-specific antibody. The CD4- CD8+ T cell clone MARO 1 recognized MV in association with HLA class I molecules and displayed cytotoxic activity toward MV-infected EBV-BC.\r"

  ".W": "The transfer of listeria-immune splenocytes into non-immune mice markedly increases host resistance to listeriosis. To study the mechanism for this enhancement, we compared the inflammatory response to infection in nonimmune and adoptively immunized mice. Despite much better containment of bacterial growth, adoptively immunized animals accumulated significantly fewer phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) in the spleen and liver than controls. Immune T cells not only inhibited phagocyte accumulation but also reduced the in vitro anti-listerial activity of splenocytes. Significant differences in phagocyte accumulation were observed even when the initial listeria dose was adjusted to produce comparable spleen listeria loads in immune and non-immune animals. However, bone marrow and peripheral blood phagocyte counts were similar in both groups. Depletion of Lyt-2+ cells (using mAb and C) from donor splenocytes prevented the transfer of protection and increased phagocyte accumulation without altering listeria-dependent IFN-gamma production by donor or recipient splenocytes in vitro. L3T4 depletion did not affect host resistance or phagocyte accumulation even though it reduced in vitro interferon production by donor cells. Hence the different effects of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells in vivo cannot be explained simply by variations in IFN production. We suggest this paradoxical suppression of phagocyte accumulation during adoptive transfer may reflect lysis of bacteria-laden phagocytes by listeria-specific Lyt-2+ cells in vivo. Selective destruction of older, heavily infected cells might contribute to host resistance by eliminating a potential site for intracellular proliferation of bacteria.\r"

We found that this event is due to trans-acting suppressor functions of mouse origin pre-existing in the plasmocytoma cells and acting at transcriptional level. Transcription of the entire family of human class II genes is suppressed, including genes as DO beta for which a distinct regulation of expression in B cells had been previously demonstrated. Suppression appears specific for class II genes because in the hybrids expression of MHC class I genes of mouse is unaffected and of human only partially reduced. Interestingly, also murine invariant chain gene is expressed in both parental plasmocytoma and hybrid cells although at reduced amounts as compared to a murine class II positive B cell line. The class II negative phenotype of hybrid cells and parental plasmocytoma cells is highly stable and unaffected by treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that the transcriptional suppressor function is not mediated by rapid, labile turning-over proteins. Possible mechanisms responsible for transcriptional regulation of MHC class II gene expression during terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells are discussed.\r"

The IL-5 signal triggers a partial induction of CL-3 cells into the IgM secretory state, characterized by a striking increase of microsecond mRNA expression and an increase in the ratio of the secretory to membrane forms of microH chain mRNA, with a modest increase of J chain mRNA. In contrast, amplification of J chain mRNA is accomplished by the late-acting B cell differentiation stimulus, IL-2, acting on IL-5-pretreated CL-3 cells or acting simultaneously with IL-5 on CL-3 cells. Such dually stimulated cells now are fully induced into IgM secreting cells. These results define the relative roles of IL-5 and IL-2 in B cell differentiation by showing important regulatory effects at the mRNA level. In addition, these results substantiate that appearance of mRNA for J chain, a molecule key to the formation of pentameric IgM, is a limiting factor for high level IgM secretion. The separate control of microsecond and J chain mRNA found in CL-3 cells stimulated with IL-5 and IL-2 elucidates a molecular mechanism by which these two lymphokines synergize in the development of CL-3 cells into IgM secreting cells.\r"

Northern hybridization analyses with a panel of V delta probes representing each of the six known V delta families showed that each of these lines expressed either V delta 1 or V delta 6 containing transcripts. Southern hybridization analysis with the V delta probes gave rearrangement patterns consistent with Northern hybridization results. The correlation of V delta expression with V gamma expression revealed that not only may V delta usage be restricted in DETC cells, but that the pairing of gamma- and delta-chains may not be random. In the DETC cells examined, V delta 1 chains paired exclusively with V gamma 3C gamma 1 chains and V delta 6 chains paired with C gamma 2 and C gamma 4 chains. Sequence analysis of delta-cDNA clones corresponding to the expressed delta-chains from one of the V delta 1 expressing cell lines and two of the V delta 6 expressing cell lines revealed that, although the V delta 1 gene segment sequence and one of the V delta 6 gene segment sequences were identical to previously published V delta sequences, considerable variable region diversity was generated by complex V-D-J rearrangement patterns that utilized various combinations of N-additions, D delta 2 and possibly D delta 1 segments, and J delta 1 or J delta 2 segments. These complex rearrangement patterns distinguish these DETC lines from early thymocytes and suggest that, if DETC are thymic derived, they originate from relatively mature thymic cells.\r"

All eight donor and recipient recombination sites are at the common pentamers GGGGT, GAGCT, and GGTGG. One of the switch recombination events is an inversion of S gamma 3 sequences. Another of the recombinational events is an internal S gamma 1 deletion, which may be switch enzyme mediated. These results, together with other switch recombination site sequences, suggest that switch recombination is mediated by cutting enzymes with modest specificity and religation enzymes with no specificity.\r"

Similar concentration dependent reductions in normal proliferation of fibroblasts in fetal calf serum-driven subconfluent cultures were detected following treatment with pentoxifylline or A81-3138. Fibroblasts assayed as confluent cultures produced sub-normal amounts of collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and fibronectin in a fashion dependent upon the concentration of pentoxifylline. In contrast, fibroblasts exposed to pentoxifylline elaborated double the collagenase activity produced by normal, untreated fibroblasts. The reduced proliferation and reduced synthetic activities were not due to a lethal toxic effect on fibroblasts by pentoxifylline and A81-3138, nor was the reduction in collagen synthesis simply due to an inability to secrete newly synthesized intracellular collagen. Unlike pentoxifylline-induced inhibition of collagen and fibronectin production, which was detected only in cultures supplemented with serum, pentoxifylline inhibits, to a similar degree, both constitutive and serum-driven production of GAGs. The addition of IL1 beta (2.5 and 10.0 U/ml) to serum-driven fibroblast cultures resulted in greater proliferation, which was inhibitable by the presence of pentoxifylline and A81-3138 as anti-fibrotic agents in certain disorders of fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Two distinct groups of proteoglycans, chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6-S) proteoglycan and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), have been recently shown to reside within the lamina densa of normal human skin basement membrane (BM). To determine whether either or both antigens are normally expressed in one or more forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a disease known to have specific alterations in skin BM, we have examined by indirect immunofluorescence 31 specimens of clinically normal skin from 28 EB patients (simplex, 5; junctional, 8; dominant dystrophic [DDEB], 9; recessive dystrophic [RDEB], 9) with monoclonal antibodies to C6-S and HSPG. HSPG was normally expressed in all EB and control skin specimens, whereas C6-S was absent along the dermoepidermal junction of 9 of 9 RDEB and 7 of 9 DDEB, and reduced in 2 of 9 DDEB cases. In contrast, C6-S was normally expressed in 5 of 5 EB simplex, 5 of 6 junctional EB, and all control skin specimens. We have subsequently extracted a greater than 400 kD C6-S proteoglycan from normal skin BM and have found that the core protein may also contain heparan sulfate side chains. Our findings suggest that 3B3 monoclonal antibody recognizes a hybrid proteoglycan in human skin, and that its absent or reduced binding in dystrophic EB skin BM may reflect either absence of associated core protein or posttranslational alterations in the proteoglycan side chains.\r"

FFAs may also participate in synthetic and metabolic activities of bronchoalveolar lining cells. In evaluating the origins of FFAs, we found that rat triglyceride lipase activity was readily detectable in rat BALF. This activity appeared to be caused mainly by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), because it was inhibited by protamine, a high salt concentration, or specific anti-LPL antibody. LPL activity was detected in BALF from guinea pigs, humans, and rabbits, but rats had significantly more LPL activity than the other species. LPL activity in rat BALF was enhanced by heat-inactivated serum, but LPL-mediated hydrolysis of triglycerides in BALF proceeded at 37 degrees C in vitro even without serum. The possibility that BALF contained an intrinsic LPL activating factor(s) was suggested by the fact that concentrated, heat-inactivated lavage was 85% as effective as heat-inactivated serum in enhancing the LPL activity of fresh BALF. Macrophages are the likely source of LPL in BALF, and we confirmed that rat resident alveolar macrophages produce LPL in culture in a time-dependent fashion. It was concluded that FFAs in BALF were produced by the hydrolysis of triglycerides by LPL.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of synthetic atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on sodium reabsorption by deep and superficial proximal tubules were examined in the rat. In response to ANF infusion (4 micrograms/kg/hr), the urinary fractional excretion of sodium increased from 1.21% +/- 0.53% to 3.48% +/- 0.48%, p less than 0.05 (n = 12). Fractional delivery of sodium (FDNa) from the deep proximal tubule was 25.9% +/- 3.7% before and 33.7% +/- 3.4% after ANF infusion. In time control animals, FDNa from deep proximal tubules was 34.3% +/- 3.0% and 28.5% +/- 4.0% respectively (n = 12). The change in FDNa from deep proximal tubules during ANF infusion (increase of 7.8% +/- 3.9%) was significantly different from the change in control animals (decrease of 5.8% +/- 3.1%) (ANF infusion vs control, delta 13.7% +/- 4.9%, p less than 0.05). No significant change was observed in FDNa in the superficial proximal tubule either during ANF infusion or in control animals. In summary, ANF infusion increased urinary fractional sodium excretion; however, fractional sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule of superficial nephrons was unchanged. In contrast, sodium delivery to the point of micropuncture in the descending limb of Henle's loop of deep nephrons was increased, as compared with controls, suggesting inhibition of sodium reabsorption by proximal tubules of deep nephrons.\r"

The occurrence of respiratory pathogens in MEE reflected their prevalence in the upper respiratory tract. Significantly fewer children who had received antibiotics prior to surgery had organisms present in the MEE. Eight and a half per cent of H. influenzae and 64 per cent of B. catarrhalis were resistant to ampicillin. The present study confirms that bacteria are present in the middle ear in a significant number of patients with otitis media with effusion.\r"

In a control group, no formal method was used to encourage patients to attend for screening, and 13.7 percent obtained a test within the trial year. In one intervention group the physician was issued a message identifying those women visiting the center for a routine appointment who were due for screening; 16.1 percent were screened. Sending a letter to patients in a second group yielded a 25.9 percent compliance rate. In a third group the practice nurse called patients on the telephone to advise them to obtain the test, and 20.0 percent complied. Reminders issued to the physician provide a low-cost, opportunistic approach to reach women who happen to visit the practice, but this approach should be supplemented by telephoning or sending a letter to those women who do not attend regularly.\r"

The degree of reduction in cranial CSF volume was independent of the individual subject's increase in end-expiratory pCO2 or mean arterial blood pressure, in response to hypercapnia. During hyperventilation with high concentration oxygen the cranial CSF volume increased in all subjects (range 0.7-26.7 ml, mean 12.7 ml). The mean changes in cranial CSF volume, induced by hypercapnia and hypocapnia, were very similar to the expected reciprocal changes in cerebral blood volume.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of circulating factors that might influence de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis were examined with rat liver cells by following the incorporation of [14C]serine into sphingosine and sphinganine, the predominant long-chain base backbones of hepatic sphingolipids. The rate of long-chain base formation depended on the concentration of [14C]serine in the medium and exhibited saturation kinetics. Long-chain base formation was stimulated by another precursor, palmitic acid, but stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were inhibitory. This kinetic behavior indicates that long-chain base formation in liver is affected by the availability of the substrates of the initial enzyme of this pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase. Since liver is also exposed to sphingolipids associated with circulating lipoproteins, the effects of various lipoprotein fractions were determined and each appeared to decrease long-chain base formation. These results suggest that hepatic long-chain base biosynthesis can be stimulated by increases in the circulating levels of the precursors serine and palmitic acid whereas some other fatty acids and lipoproteins decrease the flux through this pathway.\r"

More than 50% of the Neosugar was expired as CO2 in conventional rats. This was the same as for sucrose, but the time course was delayed by about 2 h. In germfree rats, no 14CO2 was released for the first 8 h, and 14CO2 released after 8 h probably reflected bacterial colonization of the gut. The radioactivity of the urine was about 3-4% in all groups, but that of the feces from germfree rats was about eight times higher than the level in conventional rats. When [U-14C]Neosugar was anaerobically incubated with the cecal contents of conventional rats, more than 10% of the added Neosugar was metabolized to CO2, about 66% to volatile fatty acids and about 7% to microbes. More than 58% of 1-14C-volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid or butyric acid injected directly into the cecum of conventional rats was excreted as CO2 within 24 h. These results indicate that Neosugar given orally to rats is metabolized mainly to volatile fatty acids and CO2 by intestinal microorganisms, and the volatile fatty acids produced are absorbed and further converted to CO2 in the body. Thus, the data indicate that Neosugar is partially utilized as an energy source.\r"

Compared to controls, gel chromatography of maternal liver from valproic acid-treated dams showed higher 65Zn counts associated with a protein peak of molecular weight of 6,500, the approximate molecular weight of the Zn-binding protein metallothionein. These results support the idea that the teratogenicity of valproic acid is in part due to an induction of embryonic Zn deficiency secondary to a drug-induced sequestering of Zn into maternal liver that results in a decrease in maternal plasma Zn and subsequent reduction in embryonic Zn uptake.\r"

There was a chromium x training interaction on glycogen synthase activities in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle.

Biceps femoris phosphorylase activities were not altered due to training or dietary chromium. Total protein concentration increased in the liver but decreased in the gastrocnemius due to dietary chromium. In summary, liver glycogen synthase and phosphorylase activities were dependent upon dietary chromium. Dietary chromium altered gastrocnemius synthase, but not phosphorylase activities.

Baseline CD4 levels were used to stratify the men for the severity of HIV disease at the outset of the study, and each man's CD4 levels and progression to AIDS were evaluated. These data can be used to advise patients who are HIV seropositive on the likelihood that they will deteriorate immunologically or progress to AIDS based on their own CD4 cell level obtained from laboratory evaluation. Graphs are presented here for 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up. As expected, each individual's absolute CD4 lymphocyte number, CD4 lymphocyte percent, and CD4:CD8 ratio were strongly correlated, and were similar in their ability to predict the development of AIDS. In this sense, all three are useful markers for monitoring individuals with HIV infection, and for many clinical situations from a practical point of view there is little to choose between the markers. However, the CD4 percent has slightly greater prognostic significance and shows slightly less variability on repeated measurements. Because of this, the CD4 percent may be preferable to the CD4 absolute number for use in stratifying individuals who are candidates for antiviral or immunotherapy for HIV infection, and for monitoring patients in clinical trials.\r"

Cellular DNA was extracted and digested with EcoR1 and Southern blots were performed. One of three AIDS hearts was positive for HIV-1 DNA sequences without amplification, whereas two additional hearts were positive for HIV-1 DNA after amplification. Accordingly, other tissue from the heart positive for HIV-1 without amplification was studied by electron microscopy to localize HIV virions. Unexpectedly, large numbers of proliferating multilamellated membrane bodies were identified in myocytes, predominantly associated with mitochondria. Identical membrane bodies were found in two additional AIDS hearts, and in one heart from a patient with seropositivity to the AIDS virus, but in none of three similarly fixed controls. Immunocytochemistry for HIV core (p24) and envelope (gp120) antigens did not localize gold-labeled antibodies to the membrane bodies. We believe this membranopathy may be an HIV-1- or AIDS-specific abnormality of unknown etiology that may be related to the ultimate development of cardiomyopathy. In addition, our studies provide further support that HIV-1 may be present in AIDS hearts, although as yet we cannot state with certainty where the HIV-1 is located in these tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Castanospermine (1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyoctahydroindolizine), an inhibitor of glycoprotein processing, has been shown to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with acceptable toxicity in cultured cells. In contrast to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, castanospermine targets host enzymes. We have analyzed castanospermine in murine systems, using cultured cells as well as live animals. Plaque formation by Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) was inhibited with a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 micrograms/ml. RLV-exposed BALB/c mice treated with a 20 day course of castanospermine starting 4 h postinoculation showed a dose-dependent inhibition of splenomegaly. Oral castanospermine therapy given to chronically RLV-infected mice prolonged median survival from 36 to 94 days when compared to untreated controls (p = 0.007). Castanospermine was better tolerated orally than intraperitoneally at the same dose. Toxic effects included weight loss, lethargy, and dose-dependent thrombocytopenia. At the highest intraperitoneal dose, lymphoid depletion occurred in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. We conclude that castanospermine is an active antiviral agent in animals and that prolonged oral administration is tolerable; however, when compared to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine in the same murine system, castanospermine was less active and more toxic.\r"

According to the CDC classification system, 6 presented with stage IV-C, 5 with stage IV-A, 8 with stage III, and the remaining 24 individuals with stage II. A modified radioimmunoassay procedure for detection of interferon-gamma was used with a detection limit of 18 U/L. Approximately one-half (22/43) of the seropositives exhibited increased serum interferon-gamma concentrations compared with seronegative blood donors (n = 76). There was a significant association between serum interferon-gamma concentrations and CDC stages of the patients; patients classified as CDC IV-C had the highest concentrations. Further, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum interferon-gamma and serum neopterin concentrations in seropositive study participants. We conclude that interferon-gamma is present in increased concentrations in HIV-1 seropositives compared to seronegative blood donors. Diminished in vitro production of interferon-gamma by T-lymphocytes on stimulation with specific soluble antigens contrasts with increased levels of circulating interferon-gamma in patients.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and the catecholamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was studied in the isolated spinal cord from neonatal rats. PCP decreased the magnitude of the dorsal-ventral reflex and enhanced frequency-dependent depression of the reflex in a concentration-dependent manner. Although DOPA and DL-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (a direct precursor for norepinephrine) had no effect on the reflex by themselves, DOPA, but not DL-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine prevented the depression of the reflex response by PCP in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.2A) by m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine markedly attenuated the action of DOPA in preventing the depression caused by PCP. The dopamine receptor antagonists haloperidol and chlorpromazine blocked the action of DOPA, but the alpha and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists phentolamine and timolol, respectively, did not. In addition, prior treatment of neonatal rats with 6-hydroxydopamine diminished the ability of DOPA to prevent the depressant effect of PCP whereas partially attenuating the depressant effect of PCP alone. These results suggest that DOPA attenuated PCP-induced depression of spinal cord transmission through its conversion to dopamine rather than norepinephrine.\r"

There was a linear relationship between caffeine dose and mean brain or plasma concentrations, but concentrations varied considerably at any given dose. There were also linear relationships between plasma and brain concentrations of caffeine and each metabolite, with caffeine itself having the greatest brain:plasma uptake ratio. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was determined based on uptake of the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [3H]Ro15-1788, 3 microCi i.v. given 40 min after caffeine (30 mg/kg). Nonspecific binding was measured in animals pretreated with saturating doses of clonazepam. Specific uptake (measured by subtracting nonspecific from total [3H] Ro15-1788 uptake) increased significantly with caffeine as opposed to vehicle treatment in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Brain caffeine concentrations associated with enhanced uptake were between 11 to 17 micrograms/g. Total locomotor activity and activity at 60 min, measured by an infrared sensor system, increased progressively with brain caffeine concentrations when comparing the following groups: 0, 2 to 9 micrograms/g of brain and 9 to 20 micrograms/g. Animals with brain concentrations exceeding 20 micrograms/g showed a decline in both measures but activity was significantly greater than placebo. In conclusion, brain caffeine concentrations between 9 to 20 micrograms/g are associated with increases in specific ligand uptake and motor activity.\r"

Cumulative i.v. doses of various drugs were given and reversal of dynamic compliance (Cdyn) examined. After the final dose of each agent, the animals were killed and excised lung gas volumes, i.e., pulmonary gas trapping, measured. Salbutamol, a beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist; phenidone, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; aminophylline, a methylxanthine bronchodilator; dazoxiben, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor; REV-6866, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; LY53857, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist; and LY183001, a leukotriene D4/E4 antagonist, partially reversed Cdyn and reduced excised lung gas volume. Atropine, a cholinergic/muscarinic antagonist indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor; pyrilamine, a histamine receptor antagonist; and SRI 63-072, a platelet activating factor antagonist, had little or no effect. For all animals, final Cdyn values were highly correlated with reduction of pulmonary gas trapping (r = -0.86, P less than .0001). We conclude that smooth muscle contraction is important in A23187-induced airway obstruction; 5-hydroxytryptamine, thromboxane A2 and lipoxygenase products may be involved in maintaining this response; and that this approach is useful for investigating reversal of ongoing airway constriction.\r"

To examine the effects of chronic treatment with a benzodiazepine antagonist, we administered Ro15-1788, 1, 2 and 5 mg/kg/day to mice via implanted s.c. osmotic pumps for 1 to 14 days. Plasma and cortex (CX) concentrations of Ro15-1788 remained constant between days 1 and 7, indicating no change in pharmacokinetics. Open-field activity studies showed no change in distance traveled or ambulatory time at days 1, 2 and 4, but an increase in both parameters at days 7 and 14 in mice receiving Ro15-1788, 2 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was unchanged in CX, cerebellum (CB), hypothalamus, hippocampus and ponsmedulla at 1, 2 and 4 days at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Binding was increased in CX, CB and hippocampus at day 7 compared to days 1 and 2, and remained elevated at day 14. Similar results were observed at Ro15-1788 doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine binding assessed in vitro in CX and CB also was increased at day 7 compared to day 1, due to an increase in receptor number rather than a change in apparent affinity. Binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the chloride channel site in CX after Ro15-1788, 2 mg/kg/day, was increased at days 7 and 14 compared to days 1, 2 and 4 and controls due to an increase in number of binding sites. t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in CB was unchanged throughout.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ethmozin is a phenothiazine derivative that is effective against supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Studies to date have examined ethmozin's effects on active cellular properties and automaticity, but nothing is known of its effects on passive properties or on the interrelationships among the several active and passive properties that are of particular relevance to cardiac excitability. The hypothesis tested in this study was that ethmozin, in concentrations equivalent to clinically effective antiarrhythmic levels, would simultaneously affect passive and active cellular properties so as to produce a net decrease in cardiac excitability. The multiple micro-electrode method of intracellular constant current application and trans-membrane voltage recording was used in sheep Purkinje fibers to determine strength-duration and constant current-voltage relationships as well as cable properties. A rapid, on-line computerized data analysis system tracked in time the alterations in the active and passive properties relevant to excitability. Ethmozin, at concentrations of 1.1 and 2.2 microM (0.5 and 1.0 mg/l), decreased cardiac excitability as manifested by an increase in the current required to attain threshold and/or an upward shift in strength- and charge-duration relationships, by depressing the sodium system (decreased maximal rate of rise of phase 0 of the action potential, voltage threshold and overshoot), by decreasing slope resistance and altering nonlinearities of the current-voltage relationships in the subthreshold potential range, by decreasing membrane resistance and by affecting other properties dependent on membrane resistance which would depress excitability. The data for ethmozin and other antiarrhythmic drugs are interpreted in terms of the recently proposed electrophysiologic matrix which we believe has important advantages over traditional hierarchical classifications.\r"

  ".U": "89199489\r", 
  ".W": "Cromakalim (BRL 34915), a K+ channel activator, and diltiazem relaxed isolated rat aortic rings contracted with a low KCl concentration (25 mM). Gilbenclamide (0.1-3 microM) did not modify base-line resting tension or responses to KCl but prevented the vasorelaxant effects of cromakalim without affecting those of diltiazem or nitrendipine. Cromakalim, in contrast to the latter compounds, did not relax aortic rings contracted with 55 mM KCl. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats prepared for hemodynamic measurements with Doppler flow probes, a 20-min i.v. infusion of cromakalim (5.0 micrograms/kg/min) lowered mean carotid artery blood pressure. This effect reached maximum after administration and was accompanied by decreases in systemic (35%), hindquarter (45%), mesenteric (27%), and renal (19%) vascular resistances. The blood pressure effects of cromakalim were not modified by BW 755C (lipo and cyclooxygenase inhibitor), idazoxan, methylatropine, methysergide, promethazine, propranolol, SCH 23390 (DA-1 receptor antagonist), S-sulpiride, RP 59227 (antagonist of platelet activating factor receptors) or by bilateral vagotomy associated with ligation of carotid arteries. However, in rats pretreated with the hypoglycemic sulfonylureas glibenclamide or glipizide (20 mg/kg i.v.), cromakalim, in contrast to diltiazem or dihydralazine, failed to produce hypotension. In rats deprived of sympathetic drive by pithing, cromakalim produced only a minor fall in blood pressure; however, this effect became pronounced when the low base-line blood pressure of this preparation was elevated by an i.v. infusion of vasopressin and could be prevented by glibenclamide. In conclusion, cromakalim posseses a novel mechanism of vasorelaxation that is consistent with the activation of a cellular outward K+ current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The animals were instrumented during sterile surgery with a miniature pressure gauge for measuring left ventricular pressure and a cannula for aortic pressure. Two pairs of piezoelectric crystals were placed in normal and ischemic areas to determine regional circumferential length. A hydraulic cuff occluder and a Doppler flow probe were placed around the left circumflex coronary artery. Collaterals were induced to develop by 2 min of coronary occlusion applied repetitively at an interval of 32 min for 2 to 9 days, until the regional dysfunction produced by coronary occlusion had disappeared. Collateral development was estimated according to percentage of systolic shortening and endsystolic length area (ESL area) during the occlusion. Before collateral development, ISDN in a dose of 100 micrograms/kg did not affect the level of regional dysfunction. The ESL area was 250 +/- 54 and 248 +/- 52 mm.sec before and after ISDN, respectively. After collateral development, the ESL area was 51 +/- 13 mm.sec and it decreased by 35% after the i.v. administration of ISDN. The improvement by ISDN of transient myocardial dysfunction was achieved even during electrical tachypacing. Accordingly, the beneficial effects of ISDN on regional wall motion rendered ischemic during transient coronary occlusion were appreciable after coronary collateral development.\r"

  ".W": "The rabbit hydronephrotic kidney (HNK) is a model of renal inflammation characterized by a marked increase in arachidonic acid metabolism that is temporally associated with an inflammatory cell influx into the injured tissue. The HNK exhibits an exaggerated elaboration of eicosanoids ex vivo in response to either bradykinin or the inflammatory cell agonist n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) compared with the unobstructed contralateral kidney. To pharmacologically manipulate inflammatory cell influx into the HNK we administered ethoxyquin (200 mg/kg p.o.), a combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, RS-5186 (10 mg/kg p.o.), a thromboxane synthase inhibitor or L-659,989 (5 mg/kg p.o.), a platelet activating factor antagonist, before and at various times during the development of hydronephrosis. Only ethoxyquin reduced inflammatory cell influx into the HNK and thereby prevented the enhancement of microsomal cyclooxygenase activity and attenuated the elaboration of eicosanoids ex vivo. Collectively, these results suggest a primary role of an eicosanoid, possibly leukotriene B4, but not thromboxane A2 or the chemotactic phospholipid, platelet activating factor, as a mediator of inflammatory cell influx resulting from ureter obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that nonadrenergic airway relaxation may be controlled by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The magnitude and duration of smooth muscle relaxation in response to VIP may be influenced by rates of peptide degradation after release from efferent peptidergic neurons. To explore the potential role of mast cell mediators in modulating neural control of airway tone, we studied the effect of the mast cell proteases tryptase and chymase on airway smooth muscle relaxation induced by VIP in ferret airway. Tracheal rings precontracted by serotonin (10(-6) M) in a muscle bath were relaxed by VIP (10(-7) M). We found that protease-rich supernatant obtained by degranulation of dog mastocytoma cells reversed VIP-induced relaxation, as did highly purified tryptase and chymase incubated with the tracheal rings. Either enzyme completely reversed the effect of VIP, but tryptase was more potent than chymase, paralleling previous test tube observations on the relative rates of VIP cleavage by the two enzymes. Inhibitors of mast cell tryptase and chymase preincubated with the supernatant or with the purified proteases prevented reversal of VIP-induced relaxation. Mast cell proteases did not reverse the tracheal relaxation caused by the nonpeptide adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. These findings show that mast cell proteases tryptase and chymase counteract the smooth muscle relaxant effects of VIP in ferret trachea and suggest a potential role for the mast cell proteases in the modulation of nonadrenergic neural control of airway tone by VIP.\r"

The hippocampus, like the cerebral cortex, has primarily m1 and m3 subtypes of M1 receptors; these receptors have very similar affinities for pirenzepine and for agonists, and both receptors are coupled to the activation of phospholipase C. KH values varied more than 10,000-fold, and did not correlate with prior measurements of the ability of agonists to promote cerebral excitation or phosphoinositide turnover in cortical tissue. KL values varied more than 1,000-fold, and also did not correlate with agonist activities. In contrast, KL/KH ratios for individual agonists varied from 66 for cis-dioxolane to near 1 for oxotremorine, and correlated closely with data concerning the relative physiological and biochemical effectiveness of the agonists. Each agonist showed only a single affinity in 0.2 mM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Thus binding measurements of KL/KH appear to be a new way to screen cholinergic agonists for relative efficacy at m1 or m3 receptors coupled to their native G proteins. Whereas both quaternary and tertiary agonists are known to activate M2 receptors, only the quaternary agents tested were highly effective M1 agonists. The five agonists which have been tested for improving human memory all appear to have low efficacy at M1 receptors.\r"

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that this inhibition occurs via interactions with a plasma membrane PGE2 receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase. PGE2 receptors in rat liver plasma membranes were examined using competitive binding studies [( 3H]PGE2 vs. PGE1). Binding data were analyzed to determine the number of apparent binding sites and the PGE dissociation constant (Kd) at each site. Rat liver plasma membranes contained two classes of binding sites with Kd values of 9.9 X 10(-10) and 8 X 10(-9) M. Addition of the GTP-analog guanyl-5'-6'-imidodiphosphate (0.1 mM) altered the PGE2 binding such that a single class of sites with low affinity (Kd = 4 X 10(-9) M) was observed. Similarly, liver plasma membranes isolated from rats pretreated with pertussis toxin contained only a single class of PGE2 binding sites in the absence of guanyl-5'-6'-imidodiphosphate (Kd = 3.4 X 10(-9) M). PGE2 (10(-10) M) inhibited liver membrane adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by forskolin (by 57%) and glucagon (by 24%). This inhibition was not observed in membranes isolated from rats treated with pertussis toxin. Thus, the present studies demonstrate that PGE binding to its hepatic receptors is regulated by a pertussis toxin sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".U": "89199514\r", 
  ".W": "Because atrial natriuretic factor (Atriopeptin II, ANF) exerts potent effects on Na+ transport in a number of tissues, we examined its influence on 22Na+-uptake in isolated rabbit aorta segments and the possible relation to ANF-induced vasorelaxation. ANF increased 22Na+-uptake by 44% with an EC50 of 12 nM whereas sodium nitroprusside was without effect. The increase was blocked by the selective inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) but was not sensitive to the guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY 83583, indicating ANF-induced activation of Na+/H+ exchange via a cyclic GMP (cGMP) independent pathway. The ability of ANF to relax phenylephrine-induced contractions of rabbit aorta was inhibited by EIPA at concentrations which produced inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was only marginally affected. EIPA caused a 90% decrease in the ability of ANF to increase cGMP, but did not interfere with the sodium nitroprusside-induced increase. LY 83583 blocked the ability of ANF to increase cGMP formation but failed to reduce ANF-induced vasorelaxation. These results suggest that ANF activation of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+-uptake occurs before cGMP formation perhaps at the level of the ANF receptor itself. The vasorelaxant effects of ANF involve a significant cGMP-independent component which is EIPA sensitive.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an effective and optimally safe microculture method for rapid and convenient assay of the in vitro cytopathic effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) on human lymphoblastoid or other suitable host cells. The assay procedure is applicable to the evaluation of drug effects on in vitro infections induced directly in cultured host cells by cell-free HIV-1 or by coculture with H9 cells chronically infected with HIV-1. The assay uses a newly developed tetrazolium reagent that is metabolically reduced by viable cells to yield a soluble, colored formazan product measurable by conventional colorimetric techniques. This simple microassay minimizes the number of plate manipulations typically required with other assay methods and, coupled with computerized data collection and analysis, facilitates large-scale screening of agents for potential antiviral activity. To support and enhance the discovery of new anti-HIV-1 agents, the National Cancer Institute is offering investigators worldwide the opportunity to submit new candidate agents for anti-HIV-1 screening with this method.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo growth behavior and invasive potential of normal and \"immortalized\" human bronchial epithelial cells were studied by xenotransplantation procedures, an in vitro assay of invasiveness, and determinations of type IV collagenase activity and mRNA expression. BEAS-2B cells, immortalized after hybrid virus infection (adenovirus 12-simian virus 40), reconstituted a columnar epithelium when xenotransplanted into de-epithelialized rat tracheas transplanted sc into athymic BALB/c mice. A few adenomatous growths could be seen 16 weeks after transplantation. BZR cells, obtained by transfer of the v-Ha-ras oncogene into BEAS-2B cells, were tumorigenic in this xenotransplantation model. BZR-T33 cells, obtained from a tumor produced after injection of BZR cells, were also tumorigenic; however, they exhibited a shorter latent period. When these same cell lines were injected sc and iv into athymic BALB/c mice, BEAS-2B cells were not tumorigenic, and the BZR-T33 cells were more tumorigenic than the BZR cells. The incidence of spontaneous metastases after sc inoculation was zero for BEAS-2B cells, 33% for BZR cells, and 100% for BZR-T33 cells. Similar increasing values that correlated well with the data on in vivo growth were noted in the in vitro invasion assay, the collagenolytic ability, and the mRNA expression of type IV collagenase. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells showed the lowest values in all the assays. These progressive changes occurring in cells derived from the same parental line indicate that the presence of the v-Ha-ras oncogene in immortalized bronchial cells is associated with a full-fledged malignant phenotype, which is further enhanced by in vivo passaging.\r"

  ".U": "89199683\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical benefits as well as the cost benefits of use of recombinant interferon (IFN) alfa-2b instead of conventional chemotherapy (primarily chlorambucil) for progressive hairy cell leukemia were assessed retrospectively on the basis of 12 months of clinical data from 128 patients treated with IFN alfa-2b. Data from 71 matched historical control patients who had received conventional treatment were used for survival analysis. Hematologic response (reversal of cytopenias) was achieved by 18% of the control patients versus 73% of the IFN-treated patients. This response was associated with virtual elimination of the need for transfusions and splenectomy as well as dramatic decreases in the frequency of fatal infections (22.5% vs. 1.6%) and the 12-month mortality rate (28% vs. 3.1%). Direct costs per patient per year for medical care (transfusions, antibiotic treatment, splenectomy, and chemotherapy) of those receiving IFN alfa-2b were 2.8-fold lower than costs for medical care of control patients ($5,027 vs. $14,046). Indirect costs, which reflect the present value of future earnings lost due to premature death, were 13.3-fold lower for IFN-treated patients than for control patients ($4,771 vs. $63,507). Our analysis demonstrates that IFN alfa-2b offers substantial clinical and cost advantages to patients with hairy cell leukemia and that the introduction of this therapy using novel biotechnology furthers the health care community's commitment to cost containment.\r"

Pharmacokinetic studies of IL-2 revealed 10- to 100-fold higher concentrations of IL-2 in peritoneal fluid versus serum. Ip levels of IL-2 were maintained well above those required to generate and maintain LAK cells in vitro. LAK cell activity was detectable in the peritoneal fluid for the duration of each treatment cycle and did not disappear until IL-2 was discontinued. Detection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the peritoneal fluid of all patients was consistent with production in situ by activated lymphocytes. In some patients, low but detectable levels of IFN-gamma were also found in the serum. In vivo activation of monocytes in the peritoneal fluid as measured by in vitro production of hydrogen peroxide was documented in the majority of patients. Neither interleukin-1 nor tumor necrosis factor-alpha was detected in the peritoneal fluid. We found no correlation between the presence or levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma, or LAK cell lytic activity in peritoneal fluid or serum and response or nonresponse to therapy.\r"

Of 268 penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae isolates tested, 159 (59%) belonged to a single clone, as evidenced by auxotyping, protein-I serotyping, plasmid analysis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. As this strain spread, the predominance of cases shifted from whites to blacks and from men to equal numbers of men and women. The proportion of cases associated with illicit drug use rose steadily from 19% in the first quarter of 1987 to 82% in the fourth quarter. Sixty percent of cases occurred in prostitutes or recent sexual contacts of prostitutes. These results suggest that core gonorrhea transmitters in King County are predominantly black illicit drug users, prostitutes, and their sexual partners. These are priority target populations for behavioral intervention and other measures to control the spread of all sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

In these 89 cases, intraoperative autologous transfusion provided a mean of 6.2 erythrocyte units per case or 32% of the total intraoperative erythrocyte requirements. The maximal number of erythrocyte units administered to any patient was 36.6 units (and 51% of the erythrocyte requirements). The most rapid rate of reinfusion of intraoperatively salvaged blood (11.8 units/h) occurred during reperfusion. No coagulopathy, infectious sequelae, or other complications were attributable to intraoperative autologous transfusion. In patients with large volumes of blood loss, intraoperative autologous transfusion is cost-effective, apart from the consideration of its medical benefits. Use of intraoperative autologous transfusion in liver transplantation resulted in conservation of erythrocytes and reduction in exposure to homologous blood and blood components.\r"

  ".W": "Phase and antigenic variation of pilin expression in Neisseria gonorrhoeae result from recombination events in which variant sequences from one of the silent loci (pilS) are transferred to the expression locus (pilE). Such rearrangements were originally thought to be gene conversions, but findings showing that phase variation is partially inhibited by DNase I, that piliated (P+) cells are highly competent for DNA uptake and that gonococci readily undergo autolysis in culture, led to the suggestion that pilin variation occurs through transformation by exogenous DNA. We have developed a simple method for the selection of non-piliated (P-) cells and have evaluated naturally occurring P+ to P- transitions. Two primary pathways of pilin variation can be distinguished--transformation-mediated recombination, which is influenced by culture conditions and inhibited by DNase I, and intragenomic reciprocal recombination, which is unaffected by DNase I. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both piliated and revertible P- cells are competent for DNA uptake, an essential prerequisite of the first pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working age Americans. The epidemiology of diabetic eye disease has been well described in population-based studies and the effects of laser treatment have been tested in randomized controlled trials. The authors have designed a computer simulation model using the published reports of these studies to predict the medical and economic effects of applying currently accepted methods for the control of diabetic retinopathy to the population of type I diabetics. Recommendations for screening are taken from the Public Health Committee of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Treatment recommendations and treatment efficacy are drawn from the reports of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Costs of screening and treatment are drawn from published Medicare reimbursement data. Over a 60-year period, the model predicts that proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) requiring panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) will eventually develop in 72% of type I diabetics and macular edema will develop in 42%. If these treatments are delivered as recommended in the clinical trials, the model predicts a cost of $966 per person-year of vision saved from proliferative retinopathy and $1118 per person-year of central acuity saved from macular edema. This is only one seventh of the $6900 average cost of 1 year of Social Security Disability for those disabled by vision loss. Therefore, this model supports the use of federally funded eye care to prevent blindness in medically uninsured diabetics.\r"

To test the effect of fibrin glue on nerve regeneration without the confounding variables of distraction and/or movement of the anastomosis, nerve repairs were performed with and without fibrin glue on the intratemporal facial nerve of the rat. The location of the nerve transection was the same for control and experimental nerves, but on the experimental side the nerve was repaired with fibrin glue and on the control side of the nerve was reapproximated in the fallopian canal, without glue or sutures. Axon counts distal to the repair revealed no statistically significant difference between the two methods of repair. This result suggests that mechanical obstruction by the fibrin glue between the nerve ends has a negligible effect on nerve regeneration.\r"

Specifically, its ability to overcome laryngospasm was evaluated. Laryngospasm was induced in eight tracheotomized dogs by hyperventilating each dog, and then applying 0.1 M ammonia to the laryngeal mucosa while administering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Laryngospasm was defined by steady apposition of the vocal cords, massive electromyographic activity in the laryngeal adductor muscles, absence of such activity in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA), and intraglottic pressure greater than 80 mm Hg. Upon transmucosal application of 10 mAmp current to the PCA bilaterally, the vocal cords abducted for the duration of the stimulus. We theorize that overcoming laryngospasm by electrostimulation involves a reflexive inhibition of the laryngeal adductors. This study provides an objective model for laryngospasm, and demonstrates that electrical manipulation of the vocal cords may have clinical relevance.\r"

Fiber diameters and areas were calculated on muscles harvested before the animals were killed. There was a nonsignificant trend toward stronger contraction in the NMP group, but NMP fibers were significantly larger than those in DNI and control groups (p less than 0.001).\r"

Routine identification of the RLN during thyroid surgery has reduced the injury rate from 10% to less than 4%. Difficulty in identification of the RLN contributes to this surgical morbidity. Devices previously used for intraoperative identification of the RLN have failed to achieve the simplicity and reliability necessary for clinical use. This animal study uses a simple double-ballooned endotracheal tube and pressure transducer system, which assists intraoperative RLN identification through nerve stimulation and graphic documentation of vocal fold (VF) motion. Iatrogenic injury is demonstrated by a dampened stimulation-pressure tracing. The RLNs of three piglets were injured and examined, and the degree of injury was correlated with perioperative nerve stimulation patterns. The piglet proved to be an adequate model for laryngeal research. An FDA-approved multi-institutional prospective human study using this system of identification of the RLN is in progress.\r"

  ".U": "89201911\r", 
  ".W": "Although diverticulopexy for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum was described more than 75 years ago, its use has been infrequently reported in the surgical literature. Between 1974 and 1987, thirty-two patients manifested dysphagia caused by a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. Twelve patients underwent diverticulopexy with cricopharyngeal myotomy, whereas the others had a one-stage resection of the diverticulum with myotomy. Complications of diverticulectomy were rare, but included an instance of esophageal leak, which responded to conservative therapy. Despite this low complication rate, diverticulopexy with myotomy was used in patients who possessed risk factors that made them unsuitable candidates for diverticulectomy. These factors included a debilitated state from effects of the diverticulum, a history of postsurgical complications, multiple medical illnesses, advanced age with inability to ambulate, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A nasogastric tube was not necessary after diverticulopexy. This allowed oral intake on the first postoperative day, immediate ambulation, and a shorter hospital stay. Objective recurrence occurred in one patient who underwent diverticulopexy and myotomy caused by manipulation of the sac during a subsequent surgical procedure, but significant dysphagia did not occur. Thus, although diverticulectomy has proved to be a relatively safe procedure, diverticulopexy with cricopharyngeal myotomy is recommended for high-risk patients in whom potential complications from diverticulum excision and prolonged hospitalization could be devastating.\r"

Six months later, patients were interviewed by telephone and questioned on hearing aid use and perceived unaided and aided difficulty in various listening environments. Results of the study demonstrated that patients with minimal high-frequency hearing loss can benefit from the use of hearing aids. Ninety-two percent of the patients elected to purchase the hearing aids and 85% considered the aids a worthwhile investment after 6 months of use. Patients showed a mean improvement from moderate unaided to slight aided difficulty at work and in general social situations. The only variable that predicted success with hearing aids was degree of unaided difficulty at work. Patients who perceived less unaided difficulty at work were less likely to obtain benefit from the use of the hearing aids.\r"

The spiral ganglion within the modiolus is much shorter than the organ of Corti. The spiral ganglion has 1 3/4 turns and reaches no higher than the middle of the second turn of the organ of Corti, which has 2 3/4 turns. The spiral ganglion is concentric and basal with respect to the organ of Corti. The spiral ganglion dendrites within the osseous spiral lamina of the basal turn project radially, nearly perpendicular to the central axis of the modiolus. Upon entering the modiolus, they turn basally at an angle of approximately 120 degrees. The projection of dendrites within the osseous spiral lamina became increasingly oblique as the ganglion extended apically. The organization of the cochlear nerve results from the spiraling of the ganglion. These findings are in agreement with previous reports. Implications of these findings and their possible relevance to the optimum length of the cochlear implant electrode are discussed with reference to cochlear damage resulting from longer electrodes.\r"

When the findings were controlled for clinical stage, patients whose tumors were DNA diploid had a survival advantage at each stage. Histologic grading showed less correlation, because only patients with well-differentiated carcinomas had a survival advantage if their tumors were DNA diploid.

Respiratory virus infection was diagnosed during the same period in 989 patients by detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal mucus. There was a significant correlation between acute otitis media and respiratory virus epidemics, especially respiratory syncytial virus epidemics.

An expression system has been established in Escherichia coli to increase the yield of cloned gene products, where the C terminus of ubiquitin was fused to the N terminus of unstable or poorly expressed proteins. Fusion of ubiquitin to yeast metallothionein or to the alpha subunit of the adenylate cyclase-stimulatory GTP-binding protein increased the yield from undetectable to 20% of the total cellular protein. A ubiquitin-N alpha-protein hydrolase has been partially purified from rabbit reticulocytes; this enzyme faithfully cleaves the junction peptide bound between the C-terminal Gly-76 of ubiquitin and the fusion protein. The increased yield of cloned gene products is very likely due to increased stability and/or more efficient translation of the fusion proteins. Possible mechanisms for the augmentation of ubiquitin fusion-protein expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are discussed.\r"

A standard curve constructed for wild-type two-chain rTPA that contains, from the amino terminus, the finger (F)-growth factor (E)-kringle 1 (K1)-kringle 2 (K2)-serine protease (P) domains was used to assess the overall fibrin-dissolving abilities of variant recombinant molecules. Two-chain deletion mutants lacking the E domain, the F-E domains, the F-E-K1 domains, and the K1-K2 domains yielded activities ranging from 22% to 35% of the overall activity of wild-type two-chain rTPA, suggesting that both the K2 and F domains are individually responsible for a portion of the function of the molecule. Comparison of variant molecules containing F-K1-K2-P and F-K2-K2-P domains showed that the latter variant possessed a 4-fold higher activity (1.4-fold greater than that of wild-type two-chain rTPA), indicating that, for the activity measured, the presence of K2 leads to a greater effectiveness than that of K1. A plasmin cleavage-resistant mutant (Arg-275----Ser) has been used to assess possible differences in one- and two-chain rTPA in this overall activity, the former displaying 86% of the activity of the latter, suggesting that such differences are indeed small. Finally, the proper covalent attachment of the light and heavy chains of two-chain rTPA are very important to its overall fibrinolytic activity, since replacement of Cys-264 with glycine and concomitant disruption of one of the covalent attachment sites of the two chains provides a variant of rTPA with less than 2% of the activity of the wild-type two-chain molecule. The effector molecule, epsilon-amino hexanoic acid (epsilon Ahx; epsilon-aminocaproic acid), inhibits the overall fibrinolytic effect of rTPA in this system, with an effective Ki of approximately 1.5 mM. Its efficacy, as measured by the Ki, is independent of the presence of the epsilon Ahx binding regions of plasminogen and rTPA and is similar to the efficacy obtained when urokinase was the activator in place of wild-type two-chain rTPA or when activation of plasminogen was bypassed as a result of provision of preformed plasmin to the assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of a family of GTP-binding proteins (G alpha proteins) involved in signal transduction. It is thought that this activity is responsible for the attenuating effects of the toxin on the actions of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters. By utilizing specific antisera for detecting on electrophoretic transfer blots (Western blots) alpha proteins that are subject to ADP-ribosylation, it was found that treatment of these proteins with pertussis toxin resulted in shifts in their electrophoretic mobility and marked enhancement of their immunoreactivity compared to untreated proteins. No changes in mobility or immunoreactivity with specific antisera were observed with beta subunits of G proteins. Both effects on alpha proteins required the same ingredients, including detergents, ATP, and sulfhydryl reducing agents, that other studies have shown are required for activation of the ADP-ribosylating activity of pertussis toxin. However, NAD+, the substrate for ADP-ribosylating activity, was not required. Moreover, inhibition of the ADP-ribosylating activity by 50 mM nicotinamide failed to block the NAD-independent effects of the toxin. These findings indicate that the toxin induces structural changes in alpha proteins independently of its ADP-ribosylating activity and raise the possibility that these structural changes are primary to ADP-ribosylation and causative of many of the biological effects of pertussis toxin.\r"

We have obtained cDNA clones for two distinct rat brain beta chains. We have also studied the domain organization of bovine brain AP-2 complexes by selective proteolysis. Results of these studies show that the alpha and beta chains have a similar two-domain organization. Their amino-terminal domains are relatively invariant whereas their carboxyl-terminal domains are variable in both sequence and length.

  ".W": "We present a cascade of proteolytic events catalyzed by the proteases secreted by cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts that results in the activation of interstitial procollagenase. Cultured human skin fibroblasts constitutively secrete interstitial collagenase and stromelysin as proenzymes. In contrast, interstitial collagenase found in serum-free skin organ culture conditioned medium is activated. Cocultivation of the major cellular components of skin organ culture, dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes, induces activation of interstitial procollagenase and prostromelysin in the presence of plasminogen. This activation occurs through a urokinase-dependent pathway where added keratinocytes secrete the plasminogen activator urokinase, which converts plasminogen into plasmin. Plasmin is capable of activating purified procollagenase and prostromelysin. Plasmin-dependent activation of procollagenase generates an enzyme species, by amino-terminal processing, identical to those generated by limited proteolysis with trypsin or treatment with organomercurial compounds. Catalytic amounts of activated stromelysin can in turn convert plasmin- or trypsin-activated collagenase into a fully active enzyme by removal of approximately 15 amino acid residues from the carboxyl end of the enzyme. This results in a 5- to 8-fold increase in collagenase specific activity that is due to its proteolytic cleavage and not to the presence of the activator stromelysin. Stromelysin alone in both pro- and activated forms is not capable of efficient activation of human fibroblast interstitial procollagenase.\r"

Evaluation of these composite replicas by electron microscopy reveals that contacts occur between extracellular filamentous elements and intramembrane particles. This structural organization may be important for stabilizing intramembrane components and for anchoring extracellular elements to the membrane.\r"

Homozygotes are viable as larvae, which indicates that cSOD is not essential for cell viability per se. cSODn108 confers recessive sensitivity to the superoxide anion (O2-)-generator paraquat and to the transition metal compound CuSO4, which indicates that the cSOD-null condition in fact leads to impaired O2- metabolism. The primary biological consequences of the reduced O2- dismutation capacity of cSODn108 Drosophila are realized in the adult as infertility and reduction in life-span. We conclude that the infertility and reduced life-span of cSODn108 adults arise as a consequence of the reduced capacity of embryos, larvae, and pupae to adequately protect developing preimaginal cells from O2- -initiated cytotoxic damage.\r"

One potential site on RNA polymerase II for such interactions is the C-terminal tandemly repeated heptapeptide domain in the largest subunit (RPO21). We have changed the number of heptapeptide repeats in this yeast RPO21 C-terminal domain and have expressed these mutant RNA polymerase II polypeptides in yeast cells containing either wild-type or defective GAL4 proteins. Although the number of RPO21 heptapeptide repeats had no effect on the activity of wild-type GAL4, changing the length of the C-terminal domain modified the ability of mutant GAL4 proteins to activate transcription. Shorter or longer RPO21 C-terminal domains enhanced or partially suppressed, respectively, the effects of deletions in the transcriptional-activation domains of GAL4. The same RPO21 mutations also affected transcriptional activation by a GAL4-GCN4 chimera. These data suggest that the activation domains of DNA-binding transcription factors could interact, either directly or indirectly, with the heptapeptide repeats of RNA polymerase II.\r"

This phase, which we call the \"presecretory\" phase, falls between replicating B cells that are not secreting antibodies and B cells that secrete antibody at a high rate. Presecretory cells are characterized by abundant steady-state levels of immunoglobulin and joining (J) chain transcripts and of protein but low levels of mouse mammary tumor virus envelope transcripts and low rates of immunoglobulin secretion. Additional stimulation is required for presecretory cells to differentiate into cells that secrete antibodies at a high rate. The existence of cells with this phenotype suggests that high-level expression of immunoglobulin and J-chain protein does not necessarily commit a B cell to polymerize and secrete multimeric immunoglobulin. Rather, other gene products, expressed after immunoglobulin and J-chain transcripts have been upregulated late in B-cell differentiation, appear responsible for inducing high rates of antibody secretion.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that heavy-chain class switching may be regulated by increasing the accessibility of specific switch regions to switch recombinases. In this study, we have used an RNase protection assay to demonstrate that IL-4 induces expression of germ-line gamma 1 transcripts in B cells within 4 hr of culture; induction is dose-dependent and is inhibited by interferon gamma. IL-4 alone is capable of inducing the expression of germ-line gamma 1 transcripts in small, resting B cells, but lipopolysaccharide enhances expression. The germ-line transcripts are the same size (1.8 and 3.4 kilobases) as the secreted and membrane forms of the functional gamma 1 mRNAs and presumably result from the splicing of an upstream switch-region exon(s) to the gamma 1 constant-region exon(s). These data strongly support the \"accessibility\" model for the regulation of isotype switching and suggest that lymphokines such as IL-4 may direct specific switch events by transcriptional activation of the corresponding switch regions.\r"

The cytotoxic activity of the clone was abrogated by incubation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Anti-HLA monoclonal antibodies did not block the lysis of the target hepatocytes by TA-NB-2 cells. The cytotoxicity of TA-NB-2 clone against hepatocytes from patients with chronic NANB hepatitis was 39.8 +/- 13.2% (mean +/- SD; n = 17) (range, 14.2-60.5%), whereas that against hepatocytes from control patients with chronic type-B hepatitis, acute hepatitis B, acute hepatitis A, or alcoholic liver cirrhosis was 4.0 +/- 7.7% (n = 12) (range, -10.8 to 14.0%). The results suggest that TA-NB-2 cells specifically recognize a hepatitis NANB-related antigen expressed on hepatitis NANB-infected hepatocytes by T-cell receptor and that the recognition is not restricted by the major histocompatibility complex antigens. The results also suggest that most, if not all, cases of chronic hepatitis due to NANB are caused by one agent; TA-NB-2 clone may be useful as a tool to identify this particular hepatitis-related antigen.\r"

There was no difference in water intake after normal rabbit serum and antiserum injections when water was offered immediately after icv injections. Water intake was greatly reduced by Ab-AII when water was offered 1 hr and 3 hr after icv injection. The other antisera were partially effective only when water was offered 3 hr after icv injection. The dipsogenic effect of icv injection of AII in normally hydrated rats was reduced only by icv injection of Ab-AII 3 hr before and not by the other antisera. Ab-AII injected icv had no effect on the drinking that occurred just before and after the onset of darkness and that was associated with eating (prandial drinking). The results indicate that AII is primarily responsible for dehydration-induced drinking, and the other peptides may play a permissive role since their antisera were partially effective, with longer latencies after antiserum injection, which is perhaps the result of gradual diffusion to effective sites within the hypothalamus. In contrast, endogenous AII appears to play little, if any, role in prandial drinking.\r"

  ".W": "The Public Health Service (PHS) is the second oldest uniformed service of the United States; its tradition commenced with the establishment of the Marine Hospital Service in 1798. Congress, in 1889, established the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps under the aegis of the Treasury. The Corps was created as a uniformed nonmilitary service with a distinct uniform, insignia, and with titles, pay, and retirement protocols that corresponded to those of the uniformed military services (the Armed Forces). Initially the health care system of the country, and Commissioned Corps members, were concerned with infectious and vitamin-deficiency diseases; more recently the nation's medical community has focused on cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and AIDS. A comprehensive revitalization of the Commissioned Corps began in April 1987. The intent was to restore the Commissioned Corps to its traditional leadership role as a cadre of mobile, compassionate experts ensuring the nation's health. The revitalization activities have been successful. The Commissioned Corps has approximately 5,500 active duty officers. The Surgeon General directed the development of career tracks for 11 categories of commissioned officers to increase the opportunities for professional development within the PHS and thus increase retention and professional growth. The theme for the 1989 celebration of the centennial of the Commissioned Corps is \"a century of service with distinction.\" A hundred years from now, at the bicentennial of the Commissioned Corps, the current Surgeon General would like it to be said that the Public Health Service has had \"two centuries of service with distinction.\"\r"
