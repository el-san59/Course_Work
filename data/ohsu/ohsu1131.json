  ".W": "Because marine oil capsules may vary widely in their content of omega-3 fatty acids, saturated fat, and cholesterol composition and, therefore, their biologic potency, we compared the lipid-lowering effects of three representative preparations in patients with different forms of hyperlipidemia. The ester and triglyceride forms of marine oil both effectively lowered triglyceride, but the response of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was variable; it declined modestly in patients with hypercholesterolemia and was either unchanged or increased in those with hypertriglyceridemia. The saturated fat and cholesterol content of the marine oil preparation appeared to influence the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response. Therefore, marine oil capsules are useful for lowering levels of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but the large dose required to achieve and sustain this effect (4.5 g of omega-3 fatty acids, or nine to 18 capsules daily) may limit long-term compliance.\r"

The immunization rate was also closely associated with the frequency of clinic visits, ranging from 34% for those with low visit frequency to 73% for those with high visit frequency. The highest vaccination rates were thus found in the groups at highest risk for influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Although influenza complication rates are lower in the healthy elderly, this group is so large that the public health impact of a low vaccination rate will be significant. The healthy elderly should be the special targets of future influenza vaccination campaigns.\r"

Significant predictors of albumin excretion rate included presence of hypertension and glycosylated hemoglobin level in type I diabetes mellitus, and years since diagnosis in type II diabetes mellitus. A semiquantitative test was deemed to be of limited diagnostic value. We conclude that testing for early diabetic nephropathy in routine clinical practice gives valuable information and that determination by a quantitative immunoassay based on a single 24-hour urine sample is preferable. The optimal frequency of screening and the levels that determine progressive renal disease have yet to be established.\r"

During a mean follow-up period of 4.2 years, 59 (13%) of the subjects developed overt nephropathy, 47 (80%) of whom had albumin-to-creatinine ratios of 30 mg/g or greater at baseline. Subjects with albumin-to-creatinine ratios of 30 to 299 mg/g (a level of excretion often termed \"microalbuminuria\") had 9.2 times (95% confidence interval, 4.4 to 21.4) the incidence of overt nephropathy of those with ratios of less than 30 mg/g. Furthermore, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio remained a strong predictor of overt nephropathy even when controlled for age, sex, diabetes duration, mean blood pressure, and 2-hour postload plasma glucose concentration with a proportional-hazards function analysis. Thus, an albumin-to-creatinine ratio measured in a single untimed urine specimen is an effective means of identifying diabetic subjects who are at risk of developing overt nephropathy that could replace the more traditional timed urine collections.\r"

  ".W": "Beta-Adrenergic blockers have been considered relatively contraindicated in peripheral arterial disease because of the perceived risk that these drugs could worsen intermittent claudication. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials from the English-language literature to determine whether or not beta-blockers exacerbate intermittent claudication. The primary focus of this analysis was the effect of beta-blockers on exercise duration, measured as walking capacity or endurance time. Outcomes were pooled where appropriate. Of 11 eligible reports, six included 11 individual controlled treatment comparisons that provided data for an analysis of pain-free exercise capacity; no effect size was statistically significant. The pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance was -0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.62 to 0.14), indicating no significant impairment of walking capacity compared with placebo. Only one study reported that certain beta-blockers were associated with worsening of intermittent claudication. These results strongly suggest that beta-blockers do not adversely affect walking capacity or symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. In the absence of other contraindications, beta-blockers can probably be used safely in such patients.\r"

Retail pharmacies dispensed an estimated 62.5 million prescriptions for sedative-hypnotic drugs in 1970. This number declined by half to 31.6 million in 1978. This decline has continued, so that in 1989 there were 20.8 million dispensed prescriptions. From 1970 to 1989, barbiturate and nonbarbiturate-nonbenzodiazepine prescriptions decreased 24-fold and 18-fold, respectively, and benzodiazepine prescriptions increased 26-fold. By 1989, the ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine drug triazolam was the leading sedative hypnotic, with about 40% of the total sedative-hypnotic market in the 6 years since its marketing. Data also indicate shifts from longer to shorter acting, and from higher to lower dose, benzodiazepine prescriptions, increasing use of antidepressant drugs for insomnia, female predominance of use, and increasing use with age.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE.--To determine the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a tertiary care facility, the frequency of its various causes, and the results of treatment. DESIGN.--Review of clinic records of all patients seen for the first time between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1988. METHODS.--Patients meeting criteria for resistant hypertension were examined for appropriateness of their medical regimen, presence of secondary causes of hypertension, noncompliance, interfering substances, drug interactions, office resistance (elevated blood pressure in the office only while receiving treatment), and other potential causes of resistance. RESULTS.--Of the 436 charts reviewed, 91 were those of patients who met criteria for resistant hypertension and were seen more than once. The most common cause was a suboptimal medical regimen (39 patients), followed by medication intolerance (13 patients), previously undiagnosed secondary hypertension (10 patients), noncompliance (nine patients), psychiatric causes (seven patients), office resistance (two patients), an interfering substance (two patients), and drug interaction (one patient). Blood pressure control, defined as diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less and systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less for patients aged 50 years or less (less than or equal to 150 mm Hg for those aged 51 to 60 years and less than or equal to 160 mm Hg for those aged greater than 60 years), was achieved in 48 (53%) of those 91 patients. Another 10 had significant improvement in their blood pressure (greater than or equal to 15% decrease in diastolic blood pressure). Of patients whose blood pressure was controlled after they had been on a suboptimal regimen, the two most frequently used therapeutic strategies were to add (50%) or modify (24%) diuretic therapy or to add (50%) or increase the dose of (12%) a newer drug, either a calcium entry blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. CONCLUSION.--We conclude that resistant hypertension is common in a tertiary care facility and that a suboptimal regimen is the most common reason. Furthermore, in the majority of these patients, the elevated blood pressures can be controlled or significantly improved.\r"

We sought to determine the frequency and outcome of airline travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Forty-four patients traveled by commercial air carrier over a 28-month interval, giving an annual frequency of 18.9% of these patients per year. The group that did not travel by air (n = 56) had a lower mean value for forced expiratory volume in the first second and greater prevalence of home oxygen use than did the group that did travel by air. Twelve of the travelers (27.3%) consulted a physician beforehand. Flights reached foreign destinations for 22.7% of patients. The median duration of the longest flight segment was 3 hours. A minority of patients (34.3%) occupied seats in the smoking sections of aircraft. A majority (56.8%) ambulated aboard the aircraft during flights. Eight patients (18.2%) reported transient symptoms during air travel. We conclude that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travel with appreciable frequency, often without medical consultation, and develop symptoms in some cases.\r"

On a logistic regression analysis, five variables known within 24 hours of admission were found to be associated both significantly and independently with bacteremia: low serum albumin level, low premorbid performance status, chills, renal failure, and an assumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection on admission. The logistic model was used to divide patients into three groups. In group 1, the percentage of bacteremic patients was 5%, in group 2, 40%, and in group 3, 83%. The percentage of deaths in the three groups was 0%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. The model was validated in a second group of 257 patients. The percentage of bacteremia was 1% in group 1, 23% in group 2, and 65% in group 3. The death rate in three groups was 3%, 4%, and 35%, respectively. The accuracy of the attending physician in diagnosing bacteremia within 24 hours of hospitalization was compared with that of the model. Use of the model could have improved the diagnostic accuracy in 5% of the patients in group 1 and in 18% of patients in group 3.\r"

One hundred (2.2%) of all admissions were seen in nephrology consultation. Acute renal failure was the most common presenting syndrome, accounting for 59% of the consultations. Forty-one of the 100 consultations (1% of all admissions) had a renewal syndrome of iatrogenic origin. Of these 41 patients, 38 had acute renal failure and three had fluid and electrolyte problems. Twenty of the 41 patients had drug-induced problems. Eighteen of these patients were dehydrated, and in three patients, acute renal failure occurred after surgery. Of the 20 patients with iatrogenic renal problems caused by drugs, seven problems were antibiotic related, five were due to diuretics, four were due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, three were due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and one was from the use of contrast medium. The 41 patients with iatrogenic-related renal disease were older than the other 59 patients (61.8 vs 49.3 years). Iatrogenic renal disease developed in 1% of all patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital, and 12% of these patients died. The most common renal syndrome is acute renal failure, most often caused by nephrotoxic drugs. The incidence can probably be decreased by better monitoring of body weight and fluid balance to prevent dehydration and by the avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs.\r"

Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. Dose titration was completed by week 4 after randomization, and the maintenance phase was completed at week 16. Diltiazem (sustained release) demonstrated greater diastolic blood pressure lowering at both weeks 8 and 16 by an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 16, diltiazem changed diastolic blood pressure -13.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg compared with -10.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for atenolol, and -10.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for enalapril. Diltiazem also demonstrated greater lowering of systolic blood pressure at week 3, but these differences in systolic blood pressure had decreased by week 16. More patients were classified as treatment failures during the 16 weeks of the trial for atenolol (15%) than for diltiazem (2.5%), while the treatment failure rate was intermediate with enalapril (8%). Total rates of adverse events were equivalent across the three treatment arms. There were few significant differences in the impact of the three treatments on mean scores of quality-of-life measures at week 16. There was a trend for atenolol to have somewhat worse quality-of-life scores, but none of these differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, all three treatment regimens were effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure without significant differences in rates of adverse events or deleterious effects on quality of life.\r"

The criteria were designed to use pharmacy data with minimal additional clinical data so that they could be applied to chart review or computerized data sets. The 30 factors agreed on by this method identify inappropriate use of such commonly used categories of medications as sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihypertensives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oral hypoglycemics, analgesics, dementia treatments, platelet inhibitors, histamine2 blockers, antibiotics, decongestants, iron supplements, muscle relaxants, gastrointestinal antispasmodics, and antiemetics. These criteria may be useful for quality assurance review, health services research, and clinical practice guidelines.

We evaluated five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays from Stony Brook (NY) University Hospital, Cambridge Bioscience (Worcester, Mass), Hillcrest Biologicals (Cypress, Calif), Sigma Diagnostics (St Louis, Mo), and Zeus-Wampole Scientific Inc (Raritan, NJ) and two fluorescent antibody tests (3M [Diagnostic Systems Inc, Santa Clara, Calif] and FIAX [Whittaker M.A. Bioproducts Inc, Walkersville, Md]). A positive sample by any test was further analyzed by Western blot. Using the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga) epidemiologic case definitions, patients were classified into those with clinical Lyme disease, patients not meeting the Centers for Disease Control definitions, and asymptomatic patients. Sensitivities of Lyme serologies varied from 13% to 73%, with Hillcrest showing the highest value and Sigma the lowest value. False-positive test results were found in 0% to 27% of patients. Western blot analysis was positive in six of 15 patients with clinical Lyme disease. These results emphasize the need for better serologic testing for Lyme disease and underline their usefulness only as adjuncts in the clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.\r"

Tamoxifen recipients reported moderated or severe vasomotor symptoms up to 17%, and gynecologic symptoms up to 4% more frequently than placebo subjects. Persistent vasomotor, gynecologic, or other major side effects were reported by 48% of tamoxifen recipients, and by 21% of placebo subjects.

  ".W": "It is estimated that 44,500 American women will die of breast cancer in 1991. The breast cancer screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute calling for annual mammography for all women older than 50 years have been endorsed by numerous professional groups. Third-party reimbursement for screening mammography is becoming more prevalent, and payment for screening mammography is now a Medicare benefit. Our studies, conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute grant to increase the routine use of screening mammography and clinical breast examination in women 50 to 75 years of age, have uncovered a number of significant barriers to the implementation of screening guidelines among women, primary care physicians, and providers of mammography services. These barriers, as well as methods to assure the quality of mammography, need to be addressed before universal screening is feasible.\r"

There were 40 overdoses in 37 patients aged 1 to 78 years, with two deaths and one patient being left in a chronic vegetative state. Blood sugar levels ranged from normal to severe recalcitrant hypoglycemia. Maximal duration of recurrent hypoglycemia was 82 hours. In 21 of 31 patients with hypoglycemia, response to hypertonic glucose therapy was poor, resulting in recurrent hypoglycemia. Six of these patients were treated with intravenous diazoxide and had prompt correction. Overdose of sulfonylurea drugs may produce severe, protracted hypoglycemia poorly responsive to hypertonic glucose therapy. Treatment with diazoxide is rational and effective and may be lifesaving.\r"

His hospital course was complicated by a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, for which diltiazem was prescribed. On the seventh day of therapy, he experienced fever, with temperatures as high as 38.8 degrees C. Despite an extensive evaluation, which included a gallium scan, a technetium bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound, a source could not be found. On the 16th day of therapy, however, relative eosinophilia developed, and 2 days later a pruritic maculopapular rash appeared. Diltiazem therapy was discontinued, leading to resolution of fever within 48 hours. Drug-induced fever should be considered in patients who have unexplained high temperatures during diltiazem therapy.\r"

Dose-response studies were performed for demineralized bone matrix alone and osteogenin, partially purified from bovine demineralized bone matrix, plus rat insoluble collagenous bone matrix (M). Demineralized bone matrix alone (2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or osteogenin (0.0625, 0.125, 0.250, 0.50, or 1.0 mg) plus 25 mg insoluble collagenous bone matrix was implanted into the pectoralis muscle for 3, 5, and 7 weeks. Both materials induced time- and dose-dependent formation of bone. The three highest dosages of osteogenin (plus insoluble collagenous bone matrix) induced more bone than 20 mg demineralized bone matrix and seemed to accelerate bone repair. However, when implanted into the 8-mm rat craniotomy defect for 4 weeks, 20 mg demineralized bone matrix and 0.5 mg osteogenin (plus insoluble collagenous bone matrix) induced comparable amounts of bone. These results suggest different mechanisms for bone formation in heterotopic and orthotopic sites.\r"

The average nursing time required for cases in which anesthesiologists administered anesthetic was longer than that for psychiatrists' cases. This difference may be related to succinylcholine dose and efficacy of ECT. The authors' surveys indicated that psychiatrists and anesthesiologists have differing opinions on whether psychiatrists should administer anesthesia for ECT and that few psychiatry residency programs which teach ECT provide training in anesthesia.\r"

Triazolam was hypothesized to decrease sleep latency and frequency and duration of awakening, with some effects during the first night's administration. But at follow-up, sleep measures were predicted to return to baseline levels. Behavioral treatment was hypothesized to effect sleep after 2 or more weeks of training which persisted at follow-up. METHOD: Thirty patients with average sleep latencies of 81.48 minutes, who reported chronic insomnia for an average of 2.6 years, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: behavioral stimulus control/relaxation training and triazolam. RESULTS: Both treatments decreased sleep latency but differentially. Triazolam was effective immediately but maintained only some gains at follow-up. Behavioral treatment decreased sleep latency beginning the second week, when subjects expected no improvement, with gains maintained at follow-up. Comparisons showed that triazolam group latencies returned toward baseline, while behavioral group gains were maintained at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Triazolam treatment showed superior immediate treatment effects, while behavioral treatment showed superior treatment effects at follow-up, effects that accrued during the training period and differentially persisted at follow-up. One treatment strategy implied by these results would be to combine these two interventions concurrently. This would seem to use the immediate effects produced by the medication until the behavioral skills were learned, at which point medication would be terminated. This strategy could offer immediate relief and sustained effects at drug termination.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.\r"

SUBJECTS--One physiotherapist from each district who was primarily concerned with urinary incontinence. A consensus view was requested. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Responses to questionnaire and analysis of a visual analogue scale to indicate effectiveness. RESULTS--There was a 98% response rate. Treatment was often by senior physiotherapists (108 senior I grade or above) who, in 117 districts, claimed to have made a specialty of treating the condition. Gynaecologists and obstetricians were far more likely to refer patients than any other agency (147 respondents said that they were the commonest source of referral). One hundred and fifty four respondents stated that physiotherapy was usually used as the first line of treatment. Pelvic floor exercises and interferential treatment were most commonly used (by 178 and 144 respondents respectively) and thought to be the most effective, especially in combination, though various techniques were used in applying them. Positive motivation (108), recent onset of symptoms (55), and youth (40) were viewed optimistically, and obesity (60), previous surgery (59), prolapse (42), and a chronic cough (36) were considered to be bad prognostic features. The number of patients treated varied greatly (range 10-360) between districts and was poorly correlated with catchment size (correlation coefficient 0.3). CONCLUSIONS--As physiotherapists are treating considerable numbers of patients with stress incontinence research is urgently needed to produce efficacy data to enable rationalisation of resources to cater for the whole population.\r"

  ".W": "Detection of small alterations or abnormalities in genomic DNA (eg, point mutations or small deletions) has become increasingly important in the diagnosis of genetic disease and polymorphism. When a mutation or polymorphism creates a new restriction endonuclease site, it can easily be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the DNA region of interest, followed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease. However, useful restriction sites are the exception, and a variety of specialised techniques have been developed to identify subtle DNA abnormalities. We have shown that where a DNA mutation does not create a useful novel restriction site, such a site can be introduced by PCR and specially chosen primers. The approach is simple and inexpensive and should be broadly applicable in the diagnosis of genetic polymorphism and mutation. The technique is illustrated here by the three base-pair deletion responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis and by detection of the point mutation in the rhodopsin gene that has been associated with some cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.\r"

In 1985-86, MSP cured over 98% of 5192 patients with falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border. 4 years later we studied the efficacy of MSP in 395 patients at the same location. The cure rate at 28 days was 70.8% (95% Cl 67-77.2%). The proportion of early treatment failures (in whom parasitaemia did not clear) had risen from 0.27 to 3.7% (p less than 0.0001). Failure rates were 50% in children under 6 years old, 29% in the 6-15 age group, and 19% in adults (p less than 0.001). Patients with early treatment failure were retreated with 25 mg/kg mefloquine, but 27% had a further recrudescence of infection within 28 days. The mean (95% Cl) serum mefloquine concentration at the time of first recrudescence was 638 (546-730) ng/ml, a value previously associated with successful treatment. Mefloquine concentrations were no lower in those with recrudescent infections than in age-matched successfully treated patients, suggesting that pharmacokinetic factors were not responsible for the high treatment-failure rate. Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to mefloquine rapidly, despite the addition of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine and strict control of drug administration. The MSP combination should now be abandoned.\r"

The CT scans were interpreted on the basis of the original report of the findings at CT examination and without knowledge of the results of biopsy. Of 19 patients (31%) with gastric abnormalities at CT, 14 (74%) had inflammatory changes initially reported as suspicious for gastric malignancy; malignancy was entertained as the primary diagnosis in four of those patients. In five of the 19 abnormal cases (26%), the diagnosis with CT was gastritis. The two major patterns of severe H pylori infection identified were (a) circumferential antral wall thickening and (b) thickening of the posterior gastric wall along the greater curvature, with or without evidence of ulceration. Thickening averaged 1.5-2.0 cm in cases suspicious for malignancy. The majority of abnormalities involved the gastric antrum (68%). No cases demonstrated significant adenopathy, obliteration of fat planes, or invasion of adjacent organs.\r"

RESULTS--69 of 111 premises met all criteria and were approved; 23 failed on only one criterion. The commonest reasons for failure were inadequate record keeping and lack of resuscitation equipment. Twelve practices had out of date adrenaline. CONCLUSIONS--Most premises are suitable for minor surgery, some with attention needed to record keeping. Practices must pay careful attention to the expiry date of adrenaline.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium ions are essential for myocardial excitation-contraction coupling and for increasing contractility of the heart. Because of these physiological effects, use of calcium has been recommended in the treatment of electromechanical dissociation, asystole and ventricular fibrillation. Recently, however, the use of calcium during cardiac arrest has come into dispute, as there are no controlled clinical trials supporting a favourable haemodynamic effect. It has rather been suggested that, in resuscitation, calcium may have detrimental effects. In order to evaluate the role of calcium in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is important to know the serum concentrations of calcium and the haemodynamic effects in this situation. Measurements in some patients with cardiac arrest have demonstrated that severe hypocalcaemia may not be uncommon. In these patients, calcium may augment myocardial contractility, decrease intracardiac filling pressures and increase mean arterial pressure. At present, the more or less established indications for use of calcium during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are in treating patients with proven hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia, calcium channel blocker overdose and, possibly, electromechanical dissociation combined with a wide QRS complex. There is no good evidence supporting the routine use of calcium in resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure is now a well-recognized phenomenon that appears to occur almost exclusively in patients with a preexisting reduction in renal perfusion pressure, especially those with renovascular disease. In the latter group of patients, renal failure probably results from some combination of reduced poststenotic renal perfusion pressure and a unique disturbance in the autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate. Although traditionally regarded as functional and reversible, recent animal studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced reductions of glomerular filtration rate may lead to progressive renal atrophy, an observation that raises concerns about the long-term safety of these agents in patients with renovascular disease. On the other hand, the deleterious consequences of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in renovascular disease have been exploited as aids in the diagnosis of this disorder. Whether the adjunctive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will prove to be useful in screening large populations of hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension remains to be determined. However, such adjunctive tests appear to be useful in judging the functional significance of angiographically documented renal artery stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were conducted in the conscious, chronically catheterized rat to determine whether the endothelial derived relaxing factor (EDRF) controls renal function in the normal state. Administration of the EDRF synthesis inhibitors N-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA; 100 mg/kg body weight) or N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (NAME; 10 mg/kg body wt) led to a large, sustained rise in blood pressure, a large rise in renal vascular resistance, a fall in renal plasma flow, a relatively slight reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and a consequent rise in filtration fraction. In addition, a marked natriuresis occurred because of a reduction in the fractional reabsorption of sodium. In separate studies, a continuous infusion of excess L-arginine (300 mg/kg body wt bolus followed by 50 mg/kg body wt per min) attenuated the NMA- or NAME-induced rise in blood pressure and reversed the renal hemodynamic effects such that a significant rise in renal plasma flow was seen. L-Arginine alone produced a selective renal vasodilation and large increases in sodium excretion. These observations support earlier suggestions that tonic release of EDRF controls the basal blood pressure and also show that renal function in the normal unstressed rat is markedly influenced by EDRF. These studies suggest that, in addition to controlling renal plasma flow, EDRF may have other, complex actions at the glomerulus. The natriuresis seen after acute inhibition of EDRF with NMA or NAME was probably the result of a pressure natriuretic response to the abrupt rise in blood pressure and also, perhaps, reflects removal of an EDRF influence to directly enhance sodium reabsorption somewhere in the nephron.\r"

  ".W": "A kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, which does not synthesize prostaglandins, provides an ideal in vitro model system to investigate the effect of prostaglandins in the regulation of renal ammoniagenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated significant increases in glutamine-dependent ammonia and alanine production by rocked cultures of LLC-PK1 cells subjected to either acute metabolic or respiratory acidosis. In the study presented here, experiments were conducted to investigate the role of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the response of ammonia metabolism to acute metabolic acidosis by LLC-PK1 cells. A low dose of PGF2 alpha (0.1 ng/mL) dramatically inhibited the stimulatory effect of a low pH (pH 6.8) on ammonia production. In contrast, the inhibition of cytosolically generated alanine was less dramatic and averaged only 20% of the effect on ammonia production. Furthermore, PGF2 alpha increased cellular alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, suggesting an increase in intramitochondrial pH. Thus, the cellular mechanism of PGF2 alpha action appears to involve either interference with the cytosolic pH signal or its translation to the intramitochondrial compartment. The inhibitory response of PGF2 alpha on pH-stimulated ammoniagenesis was progressively lost at higher concentrations. Both low-dose (0.1 ng/mL) and high-dose (10 ng/mL) PGF2 alpha had no significant effect on the basal rates of ammonia and alanine production at pH 7.4. PGE2, on the other hand, did not exhibit any significant response on ammonia or alanine production at either pH 6.8 or 7.4 when given in a wide range of doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91363822\r", 
  ".W": "To define proton transport mechanisms involved in the regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in cells of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), pHi and cell membrane potential were estimated by using the fluorescent dyes 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide, respectively, in suspensions of freshly isolated rabbit IMCD cells. The resting pHi of IMCD cells in nonbicarbonate Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) was 7.21 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE). When cells were acidified by ammonium withdrawal, the initial pHi recovery rate was 0.33 +/- 0.02 pH unit/min; replacement of extracellular Na+ (130 mM) with N-methyl-D-glucamine+ reduced the pHi recovery rate to 0.08 +/- 0.02 pH unit/min, while addition of 0.1 mM amiloride in the presence of extracellular Na+ reduced the rate of pHi recovery to 0.02 +/- 0.02 pH unit/min. Similar results were obtained in cells acid loaded with HCl. Cells recovering from acidification exhibited 22Na+ uptake rates threefold higher than did nonacidified cells. The rate of Na(+)-dependent pHi recovery was independent of the cell membrane potential. In the absence of extracellular Na+, depolarizing cell membrane potential in a stepwise manner by increasing extracellular K+ concentrations from 1 to 130 mM resulted in graded increments in the rate of pHi recovery. In the presence of 130 mM K+, the pHi recovery rate in acidified cells was dependent on cellular ATP levels, sensitive to 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and insensitive to 0.01 mM oligomycin in the presence of glucose (control, 0.24 +/- 0.01; ATP-depleted, 0.13 +/- 0.02; addition of N-ethylmaleimide, 0.16 +/- 0.01; addition of oligomycin, 0.27 +/- 0.02 pH unit/min). ATP depletion markedly inhibited H+ extrusion from IMCD cells measured by using a pH stat. These results provide direct evidence in freshly isolated IMCD cells that both a Na+:H+ antiporter and a rheogenic H(+)-ATPase participate in pHi regulation.\r"

In the studies presented here, the uptake of the organic cation tetraethylammonium (TEA) into confluent monolayers of opossum kidney cells was evaluated to determine if these cells might serve as an in vitro model of this transport pathway. 3H-TEA entered opossum kidney cells in a time-dependent manner. Uptake at early time points was saturable with an apparent Km of 59.1 +/- 11.2 microM and a Vmax of 1,292 +/- 210 fmol/micrograms of DNA. TEA uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by several other organic cations including amiloride, cimetidine, verapamil, procainamide, quinidine and N1-methylnicotinamide. With 1 mM concentrations of these compounds, uptake was virtually eliminated. However, another organic cation, N'-methylnicotinamide caused only minimal inhibition. TEA uptake was significantly reduced by sodium azide, suggesting dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. An alkaline medium pH enhanced TEA uptake, but, at the same pH, uptake was similar in the presence or absence of bicarbonate. When cellular pH was altered by ammonium chloride addition or removal, TEA uptake was not affected. Thus, organic cation/proton exchange, as has been demonstrated previously in apical membrane vesicles prepared from proximal tubules, is evidently not responsible for TEA uptake. Similarly, uptake does not appear to result from organic cation/organic cation exchange. These results indicate that the plasma membrane of opossum kidney cells contains a transport system(s) for the mediated uptake of organic cations and that these cells may be a useful mode for further study of renal epithelial transport of these solutes.\r"

  ".U": "91363824\r", 
  ".W": "Inorganic mercury transport was studied in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of the isolated perfused proximal tubule of the rabbit. The concentration of mercury in the perfusate was 18.4 microM. At this concentration all three segments of the proximal tubule underwent degenerative changes that proceeded to cellular necrosis at the end of the tubule which was attached to the perfusion pipet. This pathological process progressed along the tubule for approximately 200 microns. The remainder of the tubule, to the collection pipette, remained intact and free of any pathological changes. In examining the transport of mercury under these condition, it was found that, on average, the S1, S2, and S3 segments all removed inorganic mercury from the luminal fluid at approximately 140 fmol min-1 mm-1. The transport of mercury, as measured by the appearance of 203Hg in the bathing solution, was 80% lower than the removal of 203Hg from the luminal fluid. The mercury appearing in the bath could be accounted for by passive leakage through the necrotic portion of the tubule in the S1 and S2 segments, but not in the S3 segment. Leakage could account for only 16.2% of the transepithelial movement of inorganic mercury in the S3 segment. Inorganic mercury taken up by the tubule (92%) was primarily associated with the structural proteins of the tubular epithelial cells, while very little (8%) was found in the tubular extract. The toxicity of inorganic mercury was determined by titration. Perfusion with 1 microM inorganic mercury produced necrosis. The pathological features appeared to be the same as those resulting with 18.5 microM inorganic mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our findings indicate that murine tubulointerstitial fibroblasts secreted significantly more procollagen type I after the addition of cyclosporin A, whereas syngeneic proximal tubular cells expressed significantly more types I and IV procollagen after cyclosporin stimulation. These increases in procollagen gene product correlated concordantly with changes in the levels of cytoplasmic mRNA with procollagen-specific cDNA probes. Transfection of these fibroblasts and proximal tubular cells with chimeric gene constructs containing enhancer/promoter elements for alpha2(I) and alpha 1(IV) procollagen linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene indicates that the stimulatory effect of cyclosporin on procollagen expression depends, at least to some extent, on an increase in transcriptional activity.\r"

Analysis of the two methodologies shows that the combined in series technique offers several advantages, including increased extraction efficiency, decreased time of hemoperfusion cartridge saturation, and rapid correction of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities, and that it is well tolerated clinically.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To analyse the effect of a fetal surveillance unit, which undertakes a wide range of maternal and fetal tests on an outpatient or inpatient basis, on the number and length of antenatal hospital admissions. DESIGN--A comparison of the number and length of antenatal admissions six months before and five months after the opening of the unit on 1 July 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Admission rate, antenatal bed occupancy, and interval from admission to discharge or delivery. RESULTS--The antenatal bed occupancy rate fell by 22% from 174/100 deliveries during the six months before the unit was opened to 136/100 deliveries in the five months after it was opened. The difference in distribution of lengths of admission after the unit was opened from before was highly significant (Mann-Whitney test = 5.14, n = 752 and 679; p less than 0.0001), and this was due to shorter intervals from admission to discharge and from admission to delivery. In contrast, the antenatal admission rate did not change significantly (50/100 deliveries v 49/100 deliveries). There was no significant change in the stillbirth rate (6/1294 births v 8/1372 births; difference between rates = 0.0012, 95% confidence interval-0.0043 to 0.0067). CONCLUSION--Obstetricians are more prepared to discharge antenatal patients from hospital and, similarly, admit patients for delivery rather than for assessment if the patients are reliably monitored on an outpatient basis. If this change in practice is sustained substantial financial and social benefits will result as well as improvements in organisation, audit, teaching, and research.\r"

DESIGN--Population based cross sectional survey. SETTING--Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS--Of 20 Hindu subcommunities categorised by caste in Dar-es-Salaam, seven were randomly selected. 1147 (76.7%) of 1495 subjects aged 15 or over participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentrations (fasting and two hours after oral glucose loading), serum total cholesterol and serum triglyceride concentrations, blood pressure, and height and weight. RESULTS--The subcommunities differed substantially in socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyle. Overall, 9.8% of subjects (109/1113) had diabetes, 17.0% (189/1113) impaired glucose tolerance, 14.5% (166/1143) hypertension, and 13.3% (151/1138) were obese. The mean fasting blood glucose concentration was 4.9 mmol/l, the blood glucose concentration two hours after oral loading (75 g) 6.0 mmol/l, the total cholesterol concentration 4.9 mmol/l, the serum triglyceride concentration 1.4 mmol/l, and body mass index (weight/height: kg/m2) 24.3. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 121 and 77 mm Hg respectively. There were important intercommunity differences even after standardisation for age, sex, and body mass index--for example, in mean fasting blood glucose concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 5.9 mmol/l (Patels)), serum total cholesterol concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 6.2 mmol/l (Suthars)), systolic blood pressure (range 110 (Limbachias) to 127 mm Hg (Bhatias)), and prevalences of diabetes (range 3.4% (3/87 Limbachias) to 18% (20/111 Navnats)) and hypertension (range 5.7% (5/87 Limbachias) to 19.4% (43/222 Bhatias). Variables which showed significant linear correlation with subcommunity variations were entered into a multiple regression model. Intercommunity variations persisted. The Limbachia and Jain communities had the lowest prevalence of and mean values for coronary heart disease risk factors and the Bhatia and Patel communities had the highest. CONCLUSIONS--In this series intercommunity variations in disease and risk factors might have been related to genetic, dietary, socioeconomic, and lifestyle differences but could not be explained by the characteristics studied. Studies of Indian subcommunities are warranted to confirm and extend these descriptive findings and explore the genetic basis of diabetes. Communities of Indian origin should not be perceived as homogeneous.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a \"low\" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study patients' perceptions of why they consulted the doctor, how ill they thought they were, and what happened in the consultation. To compare patients' perceptions before and after the consultation and to compare these perceptions with those of the doctor. DESIGN--Patients filled in a questionnaire before and after the consultation. The doctor filled a questionnaire in after the consultation. SETTING--Three general practices in Bedfordshire and one in Hertfordshire. PATIENTS--500 consecutive patients consulting in each practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in patients' perceptions and differences between the perceptions of patients and doctors. RESULTS--Doctors perceived patients to be less ill than the patients themselves did. Patients from social classes IV and V and children perceived themselves to be more ill than the average. Patients perceived themselves to be less ill after the consultation. A third of patients attended because doctors had told them to, and a quarter of patients had already tried to treat their problem themselves when they attended the consultation. Doctors' perceptions of the consultation emphasised listening, supporting, and giving advice. Patients' perceptions emphasised prescribing, reassuring, and referring to a consultant. Doctors perceived that they listened, examined, and gave advice less to social classes IV and V than to social classes I, II, and III and gave explanations more often to men than to women. Patients perceived external factors rather than lifestyle factors as being more important in causing their problems. CONCLUSION--Doctors' perceptions of patients' problems differed from those of patients expressed both before and after their consultation. Doctors' and patients' perceptions also differed about the consultation itself. The consultation reassured some patients.\r"

SETTING--General practitioners in City and Hackney Health District. SUBJECTS--Fourteen doctors were interviewed in depth; 77 of 131 doctors (59%) returned postal questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rating of listed quality specifications. RESULTS--The most popular items which doctors thought should be included in contracts by April 1991 related to the availability of patients' notes in outpatient clinics, respect shown to general practitioners in telephone communications with hospital doctors, supply of medicines after discharge, patient management plans for general practitioners, the earlier arrival of discharge slips, the type of hospital doctor to see new outpatients, and the unnecessary duplication of investigations. CONCLUSIONS--A high premium was attached by general practitioners to effective organisation, effective communication between primary and secondary sources of care, and effective communication with patients.\r"

Forty-one patients (27 females and 14 males) with biopsy-proven granulomatous inflammation were seen at an orbital clinic between 1978 and 1989. The mean age at presentation was 40.2 (extremes 6 and 77) years. Two main clinical presentations were noted: painless, subacute or chronic mass effect, and tender, subacute inflammatory process. Six patients had secondary features that were infiltrative in character. The lesions were primarily located in the anterior superior orbit. In nearly half the patients the granulomatous reaction was confined to the orbit (predominantly ruptured dermoid and localized orbital sarcoid), and the remainder had either regional involvement (Wegener's granulomatosis or fibro-osseous process) or systemic involvement (sarcoidosis).\r"

The animals were killed in groups of five 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the injection. The mean retinal gentamicin levels 1 and 3 hours after the injection were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p less than 0.01). The mean gentamicin level in the aqueous humour was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group 1 hour (p less than 0.01), 6 hours (p less than 0.01) and 24 hours (p less than 0.001) after the injection. The mean corneal gentamicin level 24 hours after the injection was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in mean choroidal gentamicin level between the two groups. We conclude that vitrectomy significantly affects the ocular distribution of gentamicin in the rabbit.\r"

Fifteen rabbits received a subconjunctival injection of 5 (five animals), 10 (five animals) or 25 (five animals) mg of cyclosporine in 0.1 mL (intravenous solution of Sandimmune [50 mg/mL]); 5 mg was found to be the maximum tolerable dose. This dose was given as a bolus to 36 other rabbits either subconjunctivally (18 animals) or intravenously (18 animals). In both groups the cyclosporine concentrations in the ocular compartments, blood and urine were measured by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours, three animals being assessed at each interval. Subconjunctival administration resulted in peak cyclosporine concentrations of 718 ng/mL in the aqueous humour and 1078 ng/mL in the vitreous humour, compared with no detectable levels in the aqueous humour and a peak concentration of 292 ng/mL in the vitreous following intravenous administration. The peak blood cyclosporine levels were 10 times lower after subconjunctival injection than after intravenous injection. The results indicate that subconjunctival administration is superior to intravenous administration in enhancing the ocular absorption of cyclosporine while minimizing systemic exposure in the rabbit.\r"

The minimum length of follow-up was 3 months. A clear transplant was obtained in 27 eyes: 7 of 16 eyes with Peter's anomaly, 0 of 8 eyes with congenital glaucoma, 2 of 5 eyes with herpes simplex keratitis, 6 of 8 eyes with corneal dystrophy and 12 of 17 eyes with traumatic corneal scars. The most recent visual acuity was best in the trauma and dystrophy groups and worst in the congenital glaucoma group. Visual acuity results were better in older children and were fair in younger children and those with postoperative complications. Although penetrating keratoplasty is more difficult in children than in adults, it has a reasonable chance of success. However, the poor outcome in the congenital glaucoma group indicates that the procedure is not warranted in such patients.\r"

The heart rate and blood pressure at rest, the maximal heart rate and blood pressure on treadmill exercise stress testing and duration of exercise were recorded before treatment began, at the end of treatment and 14 days after withdrawal of the drops. The mean resting heart rate was significantly lower during treatment with levobunolol than with placebo (p less than 0.05). The mean exercise duration was significantly longer during treatment with levobunolol (p less than 0.05); to our knowledge, we are the first to report this finding.

The commonest cause was splashing of boiling fluids (42% of cases), followed by contact with red-hot firecracker particles (18%) and lit match heads (17%). In 59 eyes (89%) the burn was limited to the corneal epithelium, in 5 (8%) the superficial stroma was also involved, and in 2 (3%) there was associated corneal perforation caused by mechanical impact of foreign bodies. Debridement of the coagulated epithelium with patching was the most successful treatment, healing 48 (73%) of the eyes.

Surgery was done after the age of 7 years (average 11 years), the same amount of surgery being done on all four horizontal rectus muscles in patients without strabismus to turn the eyes in the same direction as the face turn. Ten-millimetre recession/resection surgery produced the best correction of the face turn and the most gaze restriction. In patients with straight eyes before surgery strabismus was not produced or fusion or stereopsis lost. In patients with strabismus, surgery was modified on the nonfixing eye to correct the strabismus in addition to the face turn.\r"

Shortly after birth affected girls present with a rash followed by pigmentary changes. Abnormalities of the central nervous system and dentition are often present, and ophthalmic problems develop in approximately one-third of patients. The authors present the pathological findings in the skin and eye in a young woman who required enucleation as a result of long-standing retinal detachment and closed-angle glaucoma. A review of published ocular pathology reports indicates that retinal detachment and a fibrovascular retrolental membrane are the commonest intraocular abnormalities in IP. Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium are also prominent, although whether these are primary or secondary remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "In a cohort of 1,720 consecutive patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry (August 1985-May 1986), we compared 768 patients (45%) with stable angina and 952 patients (55%) with unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina patients exhibited at least one of the following characteristics: new onset angina, rapidly progressing angina, angina at rest, angina refractory to medication, variant angina, acute coronary insufficiency, or angina recurring shortly after an acute myocardial infarct. The distribution of single- and multi-vessel disease was similar among stable and unstable angina patients; multi-vessel disease predominated. Average severity of stenosis and incidence of tubular and diffuse stenosis morphology were higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Patient success rates were similar in stable and unstable patients. However, on a per lesion basis, overall angiographic success rate and average reduction of severity of stenosis in successfully dilated lesions were significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Incidence of major patient complications (p less than 0.01) and of emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with unstable angina but consistent with their more precarious clinical condition and stenosis morphology. During a two year follow-up, the cumulative distributions of death, myocardial infarct, repeat PTCA, and coronary bypass surgery were not significantly different in patients with stable angina compared to patients with unstable angina. Comparison of the current PTCA Registry cohort with the cases reported in the 1979-1982 Registry revealed a 19% higher success rate for both stable and unstable angina patients. Major complication rates decreased between time periods for stable but not for unstable angina patients. Incidence of emergency bypass surgery decreased more for stable than for unstable angina patients. Coronary angioplasty is indicated in properly selected patients with unstable angina and both single- and multi-vessel coronary disease.\r"

However, the use of prolonged balloon inflations has not been shown to improve long-term restenosis rates. As an alternative to the passive autoperfusion catheter, we evaluated a hemoperfusion system in which blood was obtained from the side arm of an arterial sheath and infused through the central lumen of standard balloon catheters via a modified Medrad IV pump during balloon inflation. PTCA was performed in 71 male patients (median age 57 yr). The median balloon inflation time was 4.8 minutes and the median rate of blood perfusion was 30 ml/min. PTCA was successful (lumen increase by 20 percentage points) in 83% of patients (59/71) with diameter stenosis decreasing from a median 82% to 30%. Emergency coronary bypass was required in four patients (5%). Angiographic data for six-month followup was available on 37 patients. The restenosis rate (loss of 50% of gain) was 46% (17/37). The conclusion is that prolonged balloon inflation angioplasty has a role in complicated PTCA but offers no advantage in improving long-term restenosis rates in elective PTCA.\r"

Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome.\r"

The patients' age ranged from 1 day to 72 months (median = 8 months) and weights ranged from 2.7 to 14.5 kg. In patients with transposition the systemic saturation increased from an average of 62% to 74.6% (p less than 0.001) and the inter-atrial mean pressure gradient was reduced from 7.74 +/- 5.3 to 1.4 +/- 2.04 mm Hg. Patients with mitral atresia had no significant increase in systemic arterial saturation but a significant decrease in the mean inter-atrial gradient from 19.6 +/- 12.4 to 3.8 +/- 5.3 mm Hg. In three patients the blade septostomy was unsuccessful for technical reasons and the condition of the patient. Complications included one death due to atrial laceration, blood loss requiring transfusion in 5 patients, transient CVA in one patient, and failure of the blade to close in one patient.

No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA.\r"

Common definitions are used for data collection across all devices, and device-specific forms are used to record procedural details. NACI's unique modular form design facilitates thorough data collection, even for the most complex treatment scenarios. The database structure allows for data analysis at the patient, procedure, lesion, and device levels, as required to perform in-depth analyses of the immediate and long-term success of new devices. Once adequate knowledge of basic device performance has been collected, the Registry structure can also allow expeditious planning and performance of randomized trials comparing a new device to conventional PTCA.\r"

All of these patients underwent diagnostic renal biopsy in adulthood. Six patients had a total deficiency for the C4A protein and all six had chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.4 mg/dl at last follow-up). In contrast, 47% of the patients without C4A deficiency had chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.001). The C4 gene defect was due to deletion of both C4A genes in only two individuals, whereas three patients were heterozygous for the C4A gene deletion. We speculate that the functional alteration of the complement system related to C4A deficiency might lead to expression of clinically severe disease in an individual with a genetic susceptibility to IgA nephropathy.\r"

A total of 220 sera was screened at different incubation temperatures, before and after treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, against a large variety of cell targets by means of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antiglobulin augmented (AHG) CDC assays. The results allowed to subdivide the HSDP under study into four groups: Group 1 consisted of 13 untransplanted patients and 14 patients with a prior failed graft whose PRA values did not change following DTT treatment. Alloreactive IgG antibodies alone, with anti-HLA specificity, were present in the sera of this patient group. Group 2 consisted of 3 untransplanted patients whose sera did not contain any autolymphocytotoxic antibody but appeared completely unreactive to panel lymphocytes following DTT treatment, thus confirming the presence of alloreactive IgM only endowed with antiHLA reactivity. Group 3 consisted of 4 untransplanted and 4 patients with a prior failed graft whose sera were found to contain in addition to autoreactive IgM also alloreactive IgG antibodies. Their PRA values declined after DTT treatment on average from 96.2% to 45% and from 95% to 52.5%, respectively. Group 4 consisted of 6 untransplanted patients whose PRA reactivity to both autologous and panel lymphocytes completely disappeared following DTT treatment, thus indicating that their sera contained exclusively autolymphocytotoxic IgM antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Age and body surface area were comparable in all three groups, mean CAPD-duration (32 +/- 28 vs 26 +/- 23 months; p = NS) was comparable in renal patients. LV systolic function in echocardiography (LVEF: 62 vs 64 vs 63%) and systolic time intervals were normal and comparable in all three groups. Atrial maximum filling velocities (96 +/- 25 vs 91 +/- 25 vs 67 +/- 8 cm/s) were comparably increased, the ratio of maximal early/atrial filling velocities was comparably decreased (0.73 +/- 0.25 vs 0.77 +/- 0.21 vs 0.99 +/- 0.05) in both groups of renal patients as compared to group 3 (p less than 0.05-0.01). Atrial filling fractions were increased in all three groups, more pronounced in group 1 than in group 3 (50 +/- 11 vs 40 +/- 7%; p less than 0.05). The normal correlation of Doppler parameters with age and with LV radius/thickness ratio was altered in renal patients such that high patient age tended to have an additional negative influence on LV diastolic function of hypertrophied, but not of normal myocardium. Isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged in all three groups (134 +/- 38 vs 131 +/- 34 vs 116 +/- 17 ms; p = NS). We conclude that in patients on CAPD, diastolic LV filling is impaired both in normal and hypertrophied myocardium. High age is a factor that further attributes to diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophied myocardium in CAPD.\r"

The proportion of patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis decreased (40% of the patients in 1979-1982 vs 15% in 1983-1989, p = 0.0001) while the proportion of patients with no episodes of peritonitis increased during the same periods (29% vs 49%, p = 0.005). The proportion of peritonitis episodes due to S. aureus rose over the 10-year period (p = 0.005), while those due to S. epidermidis decreased (p less than 0.10). The overall incidence of S. aureus peritonitis remained unchanged. Catheter infection rates initially increased and then fell during the decade; S. aureus remained the predominant cause. The proportion of peritonitis episodes associated with catheter infection rose (13% in 1982 vs 24% in 1989, p = 0.025), and in 1989, 80% of these episodes were caused by S. aureus. Catheter loss was also primarily due to S. aureus infections in 1989 (80%). Infections due to P. aeruginosa were a persistent problem. The proportion of patients transferring to hemodialysis each year paralleled catheter loss rates, which in turn appeared to be more related to catheter infection rates than to peritonitis rates. We conclude that control of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa will be the key to future reductions in the infectious complications of CAPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in patients undergoing dialysis with cuprophane membranes are well known, however little has been reported of the use of polyacrylonitrile membranes in dialysis. We studied, in a crossover design, eight dialysis patients (7 men, 1 woman) aged 30 to 66 years who prospectively received 1 gram of vancomycin i.v. before first dialysis and were subsequently hemodialyzed with cuprophane every second day for a total of three times. A month later trial was repeated using polyacrylonitrile. A mono-compartment model was used to calculated pharmacokinetic parameters. Mean +/- standard deviation of vancomycin clearance varied from 5.2 +/- 2.1 ml/min in the interdialysis period to 9.7 +/- 2.7 ml/min during dialysis with cuprophane and to 58.4 +/- 15.6 ml/min during dialysis with polyacrylonitrile (p less than 0.001). Vancomycin half-life varied from 71.5 +/- 23.0 to 35.9 +/- 9.8 and to 6.1 +/- 1.4 hours, respectively (p less than 0.001). Fractional removal of vancomycin increased from 4% using the cuprophane dialyzer to 34% using the polyacrylonitrile dialyzer (p less than 0.001). Serum vancomycin levels at 100 and 168 hours were higher with cuprophane than with polyacrylonitrile (7.0 +/- 2.2 vs 3.9 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml) (p less than 0.001). Moreover, the mean levels at 100 hours were suboptimal on polyacrylonitrile. Approximately 208 +/- 53 mg of vancomycin were removed during one polyacrylonitrile dialysis. Thus, those patients who undergo dialysis with polyacrylonitrile and are treated with vancomycin may need supplementary doses post dialysis or to lessen dosage intervals than those traditionally used for dialysis patients since clearance of the drug is significantly higher than with cuprophane dialyzers. Continuous monitoring of vancomycin levels is also recommended.\r"

Among these patients who had analysis of proteinuria by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 31 patients had middle molecular weight (MMW) proteinuria alone (pattern 1), 10 had MMW and Low MW (LMW) or tubular proteinuria (pattern 2), 10 had high MW (HMW) and MMW proteinuria (Pattern 3) and 9 had HMW, MMW and LMW proteinuria (Pattern 4). At the end of a follow up period of 6 years (1983-1989) patients with mixed proteinuria had a higher incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF), 11/29 (38%) compared to those with pattern 1 proteinuria, 2/31 (6%) (chi 2 = 8.7, p less than 0.005). Based on the glomerular selectivity index (GSI), 19 patients had nonselective proteinuria but they did not have a higher incidence of CRF. By the selectivity index (SI), 18 patients had nonselective proteinuria and they showed a significantly higher incidence of CRF. Compared to the 41 patients who did not have LMW proteinuria, 19 patients with LMW proteinuria had more severe proteinuria. After a follow-up period of 6 years, patients with LMW proteinuria had a higher incidence of CRF (10% versus 47%, p less than 0.001). The presence of LMW proteinuria indicates a less favourable outcome and the pattern of proteinuria as assessed by the SDS-PAGE appears to be a better prognostic index in IgA nephritis than the SI and the GSI.\r"

The kinetics of acidification of luminal fluid in hypertrophied proximal tubules after unilateral nephrectomy was studied by stationary microperfusion and continuous measurement of luminal pH with antimony microelectrodes. 2. Trans-epithelial and basolateral membrane electrical potential differences were measured in order to detect modifications in electrogenic transport mechanisms under these conditions. 3. The values of stationary pH and HCO3- concentration were significantly lower, the mean acidification half-time was not different and net reabsorptive HCO3- fluxes in proximal tubules were significantly increased in uninephrectomized rats. According to an electrical analogue model, these results suggest (a) a reduction in the internal series resistance of the H+ pump, caused perhaps by an increased density of pump sites, and (b) an increase in the protonmotive force of the pump. 4. The trans-epithelial electrical potential difference measured in free flow conditions was significantly more lumen-positive in uninephrectomized rats. The trans-epithelial electrical potential difference measured during intraluminal perfusion with Ringer solution containing 30 mmol/l HCO3- was significantly more negative in all groups studied. In uninephrectomized rats treated with acetazolamide, the trans-epithelial electrical potential difference was more lumen-negative than that in untreated uninephrectomized rats. These results are compatible with a steeper transepithelial Cl- gradient as well as with electrogenic, active H+ secretion. 5. There was no significant difference in the basolateral electrical potential difference between control and uninephrectomized rats. 6. In conclusion, our data show an increase in the transport rates of HCO3- in the proximal tubule of uninephrectomized rats, which may be due to an increase in the density of transporters in the brush-border membrane, and an increased ability of the transport mechanism to create H+ gradients.\r"

Accordingly, erythrocyte survival studies using 51Cr were performed on male and female distance runners (n = 20) and sedentary control subjects (n = 10) in order to determine whether the rate of erythrocyte destruction was altered as a consequence of repetitive exercise training. 2. The chromium half-disappearance time of the male (25.4 +/- 3.6 days, mean +/- SD) but not the female (28.3 +/- 4.6 days) athletes was significantly lower than that of the male (33.1 +/- 4.5 days) and female (32.3 +/- 2.6 days) control subjects (P less than 0.01). The mean erythrocyte lifespan of the male and female distance runners (67.2 +/- 22.2 and 72.4 +/- 26.0 days, respectively) was significantly shorter than that of the non-exercising male and female subjects (113.4 +/- 31.0 and 114.1 +/- 29.0 days, respectively) (P less than 0.01). 3. There was no correlation between the mean erythrocyte lifespan and the haemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin levels, body mass, weekly training distance, number of years running or daily protein intake. The mean cell volume and reticulocyte count measured in the same athletes before and after completing a standard 42 km marathon race were within the normal range, whereas the plasma haemoglobin levels were elevated (77.0 +/- 50.5 mg/l) and the serum haptoglobin levels were decreased (0.89 +/- 0.4 g/l) at rest, with a further significant decrease after running (0.69 +/- 0.4 g/l) in the latter measurement (P less than 0.05). 4. It is concluded that the demonstrated increase in erythrocyte turnover may be sufficient to precipitate an iron deficiency in endurance athletes when dietary intake or absorption does not meet the accelerated erythropoietic demands.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (expressed in terms of extracellular fluid volume), renal blood flow (expressed as a fraction of cardiac output) and filtration fraction were measured by using 99mTc-labelled diethylenetriamine-penta-acetate. They were compared with the dosage and trough blood levels of cyclosporin A, and, in 15 patients receiving prednisolone in addition to cyclosporin A, with steroid dosage. 3. All 17 children had a renogram performed 6 months after starting cyclosporin A treatment. Nine of them also had a renogram before starting cyclosporin A treatment (baseline study), while 13, in addition to their renogram 6 months after starting cyclosporin A treatment, also had at least one further renogram. 4. Glomerular filtration rate/extracellular fluid volume fell slightly but significantly from 0.009 (SD 0.0013) before starting cyclosporin A treatment to 0.0085 (0.002) min-1 (P less than 0.01) 6 months after cyclosporin A treatment in the nine children who underwent a baseline study. This was accompanied by a significant (P less than 0.001) fall in filtration fraction from 0.108 (0.015) to 0.088 (0.014). However, renal blood flow/cardiac output showed no change. 5. In the 13 children studied beyond 6 months after starting cyclosporin A treatment, there was no further significant overall change in any renal haemodynamic variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Albumin fractional synthetic rate was determined in five non-pregnant subjects and five normal pregnant subjects in late gestation after an overnight fast by simultaneous prime and intravenous infusion of two precursor amino acids, [15N]glycine and L-[1-13C]leucine, with additional priming of the large but, slowly turning over, urea pool with [15N2]urea. 2. The two tracers yielded similar values of albumin fractional synthetic rate: 6.1 and 6.0%/day in non-pregnant subjects and 7.3 and 7.6%/day in pregnant subjects, for glycine and leucine, respectively. While plasma volume was greater and serum albumin concentration was significantly reduced during pregnancy, the calculated intravascular albumin mass was significantly increased in pregnant subjects. 3. The amount of albumin synthesized in the intravascular compartment was significantly greater at 8.8 and 9.5 g/day in pregnant subjects compared with 6.4 and 6.3 g/day in non-pregnant control subjects (glycine and leucine methods, respectively). Calculated whole-body protein turnover using glycine was not different between the two subject groups, but leucine flux was higher in pregnant subjects. Partitioning of nitrogenous products in urine revealed that pregnant subjects excreted less urea, less ammonia and less creatinine than the non-pregnant control subjects. 4. These findings suggest that whereas the serum albumin concentration decreases during pregnancy secondary to the large increase in plasma volume, there is an increase in albumin synthesis such that total intravascular albumin mass is increased in late pregnancy.\r"

The effects of the subcutaneous administration of a long-acting somatostatin analogue (octreotide) or of placebo on the splanchnic blood flow response to a mixed solid meal has been examined in eight normal subjects by using a transcutaneous Doppler ultrasound technique. Each subject was studied on two occasions more than 1 week apart. 2. On the control day, feeding had a pronounced effect on both superior mesenteric artery and portal venous blood flows, causing a peak rise of 82% in superior mesenteric artery blood flow at 15 min and of 75% in portal venous blood flow at 30 min post-prandially (P less than 0.001). Blood flows remained elevated 2 h after the meal. Pulse and blood pressure showed no significant changes from baseline. 3. Octreotide reduced fasting superior mesenteric artery blood flow by 59% (P less than 0.05) and portal venous blood flow by 49% (P less than 0.01) and blunted the normal post-prandial rise. Pulse and blood pressure did not change in response to either the injection or the ingestion of the meal. 4. Octreotide suppressed the release of insulin, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide in response to feeding and resulted in post-prandial hyperglycaemia. 5. The mechanism of action of octreotide on splanchnic blood flow is uncertain. It may be mediated via a direct vascular effect or it may act via suppression of vasoactive intestinal hormones.\r"

To assess the value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the activity was measured in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in control subjects. 2. Mean serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity was significantly greater in 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (225 +/- 69 nkat/l) than in 35 patients with cirrhosis and 20 normal subjects (134 +/- 30 and 93 +/- 28 nkat/l, respectively). The overlap between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, however, was such as to severely limit any value of the enzyme as a diagnostic test. 3. In four cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, an increased enzyme activity was detectable in samples taken up to 66 months before the tumours were diagnosed clinically. 4. The serum activity of alpha-L-fucosidase fell to within the reference range after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in three patients and in one of these a subsequent rise was associated with tumour recurrence which was diagnosed at 8 months after the rise in activity. Ineffective cytotoxic chemotherapy was also associated with a progressive rise in serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity. 5. alpha-L-fucosidase activity in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that seen in non-tumour tissue from cirrhotic patients. These reductions may represent increased transport from the tissue and may partly account for the increased serum activity found in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "1. The effect of hyperketonaemia on counter-regulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia has been examined in six healthy subjects. 2. A controlled, step-wise reduction in blood glucose concentration was achieved by adjusting the rate of glucose infusion during a primed-continuous infusion of soluble insulin (1.5 m-units min-1 kg-1 body weight, plasma insulin concentration approximately 90 m-units/l). Simultaneous infusion of either saline or beta-hydroxybutyrate (3 mg min-1 kg-1 body weight) was administered in a single-blind fashion, in random order. Despite a need for 40% more glucose during the ketone infusion, an identical fall in blood glucose concentration was achieved in each study. 3. The glycaemic threshold for stimulating an adrenaline response of 0.41 nmol/l was reduced from 3.1 to 2.8 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) during ketone infusion, and that for stimulating a response of more than 50% of basal from 3.6 to 3.1 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). The peak adrenaline response fell from 7.97 to 2.6 nmol/l (P less than 0.04). Peak noradrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone responses were also significantly lower during ketone infusion (P = 0.04, 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Glucagon responses alone were unaffected by hyperketonaemia. 4. The provision of an alternate metabolic fuel thus produced immediate changes in the neurohumoral responses to hypoglycaemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that human nervous tissue can metabolize ketones acutely.\r"

  ".W": "1. A study on seven Caucasian glucose-tolerant women with previous gestational diabetes and seven matched control subjects is presented. The insulin response to oral glucose, insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose production rates were measured by using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, an insulin tolerance test and a non-radioactive tracer, [6,6-2H]glucose, respectively. 2. Fasting plasma glucose levels were similar between the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l), as were fasting plasma insulin levels (median 4 m-units/l, range 1-13 m-units/l versus median 4 m-units/l, range 1-24 m-units/l). After oral glucose the 60 min plasma glucose levels in the women with previous gestational diabetes were significantly higher (8.5 +/- 0.6 versus 6.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, P less than 0.05), whereas the plasma insulin level was significantly lower at both 30 min (median 23 m-units/l, range 4-47 m-units/l versus median 55 m-units/l, range 23-100 m-units/l, P less than 0.02) and at 60 min (median 23 m-units/l, range 4-43 m-units/l versus median 60 m-units/l, range 16-126 m-units/l, P less than 0.02). 3. Insulin sensitivity, expressed as the slope of the regression line of plasma glucose level against time after intravenous infusion of insulin (0.05 unit/kg), was similar in the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (mean slope, -0.17 +/- 0.01 versus -0.17 +/- 0.01). 4. Fasting glucose production rates were similar in the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (2.2 +/- 0.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg min-1 kg-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. After bilateral ureteral obstruction there is an enhanced production of thromboxane A2 by the kidney which contributes to a decline in renal function. An acute interstitial macrophage infiltrate also occurs. 2. The relative contribution of infiltrating cells and intrinsic renal cells to the enhanced production of thromboxane A2 by the hydronephrotic kidney were determined. The effects of both irradiation and subsequent administration of the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor OKY-046 on both thromboxane B2 excretion and renal function were examined in rats with 24 h bilateral ureteral obstruction. 3. Irradiation effectively prevented the leucocyte infiltrate after bilateral ureteral obstruction (1.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) versus 27.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) cells/g of cortex, n = 4 in each group), resulted in a significantly higher inulin clearance (2.78 +/- 0.27 versus 1.49 +/- 0.17 ml min-1 kg-1 body weight, n = 7 and n = 8, respectively, P less than 0.001) and reduced thromboxane B2 excretion to 39% of non-irradiated values. Subsequent administration of OKY-046 to previously irradiated animals further reduced thromboxane B2 excretion to 20% of the value in non-irradiated rats with bilateral obstruction and further increased inulin clearance to 3.34 +/- 0.26 ml min-1 kg-1 body weight. 4. Glomerular macrophage numbers were decreased after bilateral ureteral obstruction (in contrast to the interstitium). However, glomeruli isolated from rats with 24 h bilateral ureteral obstruction exhibited enhanced production of thromboxane B2 compared with sham-operated control rats (855.6 +/- 31.1 versus 392.2 +/- 25.5 pg 60 min-1 mg-1 of protein, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have investigated the presence of the connective-tissue-degrading metalloproteinases in homogenates prepared from atherosclerotic, aneurysmal and control aortic media. 2. Gelatinase activity was much increased in homogenates from atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aorta [10.9 +/- 1.8 and 13.3 +/- 3.3 micrograms of gelatin hydrolysed h-1 (mg of protein)-1 respectively]. This gelatinase activity was highest at the luminal aspect of the aortic media, where the activity increased three- to five-fold after the destruction of alpha 2-macroglobulin. Zymograms demonstrated the principal gelatinase in atherosclerotic aorta to have a molecular mass of about 92 kDa, whereas in aneurysmal aorta there was a spectrum of gelatinase activity from 92 to 55 kDa. 3. Collagenase and stromelysin (proteoglycanase) could be detected by immunoblotting in homogenates of aneurysmal aorta, but rarely in atherosclerotic aorta and never in control aorta. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were low, but increased two- to three-fold after the destruction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were highest at the adventitial aspect of aneurysmal media. 4. The secretion of gelatinase by inflammatory cells at the intima of diseased aorta could have a pathological role in establishing atherosclerotic plaques and medial thinning. Secretion of collagenase, gelatinase and stromelysin from the adventitia could accelerate connective tissue degradation in the media of aneurysmal aorta.\r"

In 31 consecutively referred patients (20 females, 11 males) with overt or suspected orthostatic disorders, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that occur in the first 2 min of standing were analysed. 2. Blood pressure was measured continuously by Finapres. The blood pressure and heart rate responses after 1-2 min of standing (early steady-state response) were used to classify the patients as follows: group I (n = 17, age 42 +/- 17 years), normal early steady-state blood pressure and heart rate responses; group II (n = 5, age 40 +/- 14 years), combination of normal early steady-state blood pressure and postural tachycardia; group III (n = 9, age 51 +/- 14 years), hypotensive orthostatic response with (4/9) or without (5/9) postural tachycardia. We examined whether additional information could be obtained by beat-to-beat analysis of the initial circulatory response (first 30 s). It was quantified by identifying the blood pressure trough and overshoot and the maximum heart rate and relative bradycardia. 3. The initial drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between the three groups. A recovery of blood pressure with a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure overshoot was present in all group I and II patients, but was absent in all except two patients in group III. The initial maximum heart rate increase did not differ between the three groups. The relative bradycardia was less in groups II and III than in group I. 4. We conclude that analysis of the beat-to-beat blood pressure changes in the first 30 s after the onset of standing provides almost all the information that is necessary to determine abnormalities in orthostatic circulatory control.\r"

Fifty healthy subjects were studied: 29 between 19 and 40 years of age, 11 between 41 and 60 years of age, and 10 between 61 and 85 years of age. The two groups aged less than 60 years showed only marginal differences in muscle composition, whereas the highest age group showed increases in muscle fat content in relation to tissue weight and decreases in alkali-soluble protein content in relation to both tissue weight and tissue DNA content. Also, potassium, magnesium, total creatine and RNA contents were decreased in this age group when related to tissue DNA content. When alkali-soluble protein was used as a reference base, only magnesium content was decreased. 3. A comparison was also made between female (n = 23) and male (n = 18) subjects in the age groups below 60 years. Differences observed included a higher fat content in female muscle, and an increase in total creatine content in relation to tissue weight. The alkalisoluble protein content was lower per muscle cell in the females when calculated on the basis of DNA content. 4. The results show that in the assessment of muscle constituents, age and sex must be taken into account.\r"

We have investigated whether this interaction occurs in forearm resistance vessels in man. 2. The effect of arterial infusion of angiotensin II (320 fmol/min) on sympathetic vasoconstriction produced by lower-body negative pressure (15 mmHg) was studied in six subjects, and that on the response to exogenous noradrenaline (37.5-150 pmol/min) was studied in a further eight subjects. Forearm blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. 3. The dose of angiotensin II was chosen to produce no alteration in resting blood flow, and those of noradrenaline were selected to provide a reduction in blood flow equivalent to that produced by lower-body negative pressure. 4. Lower-body negative pressure produced no change in heart rate or diastolic blood pressure, but caused an initial 5 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01). Blood flow was reduced by 21 +/- 6% in both forearms by lower-body negative pressure during saline infusion. During angiotensin II infusion, there was a marked difference in the response to lower-body negative pressure, with blood flow being reduced by 40 +/- 7% in the infused arm, but only by 21 +/- 4% in the control arm (P less than 0.05). Angiotensin II infusion had no effect on resting blood flow or the responses to noradrenaline. 5.

In order to investigate further the angiogenic mechanisms involved in muscle capillarization, endothelial-cell-stimulating angiogenic factor activities in various rodent skeletal muscles were compared. 2. Eleven untrained adult male Wistar rats were killed and the predominantly oxidative (type I) muscle,s soleus and heart, the predominantly glycolytic (type II) muscle, extensor digitorum longus, and the mixed-fibre muscle, gastrocnemius, were removed. Each sample was separately homogenized and centrifuged and the supernatants were diafiltered to isolate the low-molecular-mass fraction containing endothelial-cell-stimulating angiogenic activity. This was assayed for its ability to activate latent collagenase and was expressed as units, where 1 unit represents the percentage activation of the enzyme h-1 (mg of protein in the supernatant)-1. 3. The results (medians and ranges) demonstrated significantly greater endothelial-cell-stimulating angiogenic factor activity in extensor digitorum longus muscle (2.14 units, 0.62-2.87 units, n = 13) than in soleus (0.82 units, 0.59-1.79 units, n = 15), gastrocnemius (0.34 units, 0.28-0.40 units, n = 4) or heart (0.43 units, 0.16-0.52 units, n = 11) (P less than 0.01 for each) muscle. 4. These findings suggest that endothelial-cell-stimulating angiogenic activity in muscle is either inversely or not related to the local capillary density, which may be at or near a maximum in physiologically contracting, predominantly oxidative muscles.\r"

This study investigates the effect of nifedipine on cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats after either uninephrectomy or uninephrectomy with contralateral renal denervation. 2. Fourteen days after uninephrectomy pair-fed rats were injected for 14 days with cyclosporin A (25 mg/kg body weight) via the subcutaneous route and with nifedipine (0.1 mg/kg body weight) via the intraperitoneal route. Renal and systemic haemodynamics were measured in conscious unrestrained rats. 3. Whole-blood levels of cyclosporin A did not differ between groups (overall 352 +/- 22 ng/ml, means +/- SEM). After uninephrectomy, cyclosporin A decreased the glomerular filtration rate (olive oil versus cyclosporin A: 0.96 +/- 0.04 versus 0.70 +/- 0.06 ml min-1 100 g body weight, P less than 0.02) and effective renal plasma flow (1.94 +/- 0.10 versus 1.38 +/- 0.13, P less than 0.01), and increased renal vascular resistance [(20.2 +/- 1.8) x 10(4) versus (31.6 +/- 3.3) x 10(4) kPa l-1 s [(20.2 +/- 1.8) x 10(3) versus (31.6 +/- 3.3) x 10(3) dyn s cm-5], P less than 0.02] and mean arterial pressure (146.7 +/- 6.7 versus 167.3 +/- 2.9 mmHg, P less than 0.05). Neither renal denervation nor nifedipine prevented the reduction in glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow induced by cyclosporin A. 4. This study infers that the sympathetic nervous system does not play an active role in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity and demonstrates that the concomitant administration of nifedipine to rats with reduced renal mass does not ameliorate cyclosporin A-induced renal impairment.\r"

By contrast, there is little information regarding the effect of sub-normal blood glucose concentrations on gastric and, in particular, pyloric motility, although limited data suggest that hypoglycaemia is associated with accelerated gastric emptying despite an apparently increased basal pyloric pressure. 2. To determine the effects of hypoglycaemia on pyloric motility, we compared the effects of an intravenous injection of insulin (0.15 units/kg) with those of a placebo injection of saline in eight healthy human volunteers during phase I of the interdigestive migrating motor complex. 3. All subjects developed profound hypoglycaemia (mean blood glucose concentration 1.6 mmol/l compared with 4.0 mmol/l in the control group). 4. There was no significant difference in the number of antral (9 versus 7, P = 0.34), pyloric (3 versus 0, P = 0.31) or duodenal (21 versus 13, P = 0.42) pressure waves or in the basal pyloric pressure (0.3 mmHg versus 0.1 mmHg, P = 0.37) in the 45 min after insulin injection (hypoglycaemia) when compared with the 45 min after saline injection (euglycaemia). In both the euglycaemic and hypoglycaemic studies there was a time-dependent increase in the numbers of antral and duodenal waves consistent with the expected changes in the interdigestive migrating motor complex. 5. These results indicate that insulin-induced hypoglycaemia has no significant effect on pyloric motility during phase I of the interdigestive migrating motor complex.\r"

Ventilation/perfusion scans were evaluated among 365 patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and compared to V/Q scans in 526 patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease. Among patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 117 and PE was excluded in 248. Among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 140 and excluded in 386. The positive predictive value for PE of high probability V/Q scans among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 55 of 66 (83 percent), was not significantly lower than among patients without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 50 of 54 (93 percent) (NS). The positive predictive value of low probability V/Q scans was similar with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 25 of 182 (14 percent), and without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 17 of 113 (15 percent) (NS), as was the predictive value of near normal/normal V/Q scans, 2 of 51 (4 percent), vs 3 of 79 (4 percent) (NS). The sensitivity of high probability V/Q scans, with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 55 of 140 (39 percent) vs 50 of 117 (43 percent), did not differ significantly. The specificity of high probability V/Q scans with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 375 of 386 (97 percent) vs 244 of 248 (98 percent) was also similar (NS). In conclusion, the diagnostic utility of V/Q scans for acute PE was not impaired by the presence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Fewer patients, however, with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, had intermediate (indeterminate) V/Q scans.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a hospital-based home care program for a group of patients with severe COPD. Respi-Care was a multidisciplinary home care program administered by Norwalk Hospital in cooperation with the public health nursing departments of the city of Norwalk and the town of Wilton, Conn. The overall goal of Respi-Care was to provide more comprehensive home care services to patients previously requiring frequent hospitalizations by combining the advantages of hospital resources and community agencies through a unique cooperative effort. Preprogram and on-program data were collected on the following variables for the 48 months of Respi-Care operation: hospitalizations; hospital days; emergency room visits; home care services; and the costs of these services. Costs of operating the Respi-Care program were included in on-program data. Seventeen subjects completed 320.5 months on Respi-Care. Each subject was matched to an equal length of time prior to entering the program, for a total of 641 months analyzed. There were 88 preprogram hospitalizations for the group; hospitalizations while participating in Respi-Care dropped to 53 (p = 0.022; paired t statistics). On-program hospital days showed a significant decrease, from 1,181 preprogram days to 667 on-program days (p = 0.024). Emergency room visits decreased from 105 before the program to 64 during the program (p = 0.017). Costs of care also decreased. Costs for hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and home care fell from $908,031 to $802,999, resulting in a $105,032 savings or $328 per patient per month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed physiologic, psychological, and cognitive functioning in outpatients with COPD. Sixty-four subjects, 53 to 82 years of age, participated in the 30-day exercise rehabilitation program. The program consisted of exercise, education and psychosocial counselling. Participants were assessed prior to beginning the program and at the end of 30 days. Assessments at both times included physiologic functioning (bicycle ergometry testing, pulmonary function tests, 12-min walk), psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, perceived well-being) and an abbreviated neuropsychological test battery. Results indicate significant improvement in physical endurance and pulmonary function, significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improvement in measures of general well-being and neuropsychological functioning. The study suggests that exercise rehabilitation of older adults with COPD contributes not only to improvements in physical functioning and endurance, but also to enhanced cognitive functioning and psychological well-being.\r"

  ".W": "We studied high intensity, symptom-limited, endurance exercise training in 52 patients with COPD participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. The patients had moderate to severe airway obstruction and reduced exercise tolerance with ventilatory limitation. The target workload for endurance exercise testing was 95 percent of the baseline maximum treadmill work load. At training weeks 1, 4 and 8, they were training at 85, 84, and 86 percent respectively, of baseline maximum. After rehabilitation, there was an increase in maximal treadmill work load, VO2max, and endurance exercise time, and a decrease in perceived symptoms. Patients who did not reach anaerobic threshold (group 2) were able to train at a higher percentage of maximum exercise tolerance than patients who reached anaerobic threshold (group 1). The increase in exercise performance of both groups, however, was similar. We conclude that patients with moderate to severe COPD can perform exercise training successfully at intensity targets which represent higher percentages of maximum than typically recommended in normal individuals or other patients.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a variety of other streptococci were inhibited at a smoke solution dilution of 1:8. Enteric bacteria such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas were not affected by a 1:1 dilution of the solution. As with the Gram-positive cocci, the Neisseria species and Branhamella were also inhibited at a dilution of 1:8. Culture results of the mouth of 15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers showed that the smokers have a propensity to develop heavy Gram-negative bacterial colonization.\r"

Forty patients were assigned a clinical score based on the presence or absence of loud snoring, observations of interrupted breathing during sleep, hypersomnolence, obesity and essential hypertension. Each underwent a night of domiciliary pulse oximetry followed by nocturnal polysomnography. Significant OSA was confirmed in 26. All 15 patients with positive pulse oximetry tracings had significant OSA (apnea index greater than or equal to 10). Five of eight with negative tracings were also shown to have significant OSA along with six of the seven patients with inadequate or indeterminate tracings. Clinical scores were significantly different for those with and without OSA. This study confirms the usefulness of nocturnal pulse oximetry in establishing the diagnosis of OSA and highlights the value of a clinical score in improving its sensitivity as a screening tool.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Seeking an inexpensive, readily available, clinical, screening, and field surveillance test of airway obstruction, we determined the validity of current dogma that forced expiratory time (FET) is a good clinical test of airway obstruction yet is of no epidemiologic use given excessive intrasubject variability. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty-nine white male plumbers and pipefitters were evaluated by spirometry, chest roentgenography, and a standardized respiratory questionnaire during a union-sponsored asbestos screening program. Subjects were classified as having large airway obstruction (LAO), small airway obstruction (SAO) alone, or no obstruction, on the basis of standard spirometric prediction equations. Two physicians, blinded to clinical and spirometric data, independently measured FET while auscultating the trachea with a stethoscope. The FET was defined as the time taken for an individual to forcefully exhale through an open mouth from total lung capacity until airflow became inaudible. Five such times were recorded for each subject. The mean of the three times having the narrowest range was deemed the FET for calculating test sensitivity and specificity. Based on previous literature, an FET greater than or equal to 6 s was considered abnormally prolonged. RESULTS: Two hundred five subjects completed both spirometry and FET testing; 67 had LAO, 5 SAO, and 133 no obstruction. A total of 83 percent had three FETs reproducible within a range of less than or equal to 1 s. The sensitivity and specificity of FET for LAO were 92 and 43 percent, respectively, while for SAO alone, 60 and 44 percent, respectively. Overall, FET misclassified 56 percent of nonobstructed subjects. Adjusting the normal-abnormal cutoff points for both FET and SAO minimally improved the performance of FET. CONCLUSION: Although FET is a simple, inexpensive, sensitive, and fairly reproducible clinical test of LAO, it cannot be recommended as a clinical or an epidemiologic tool because of its extremely low specificity.\r"

  ".W": "To study the temporal relation between the peak of circadian variation of bronchial responsiveness and the trough of circadian variation of bronchial caliber, we performed seven inhalation challenges with histamine at 4-h intervals in six stable asthmatic children aged eight to ten years. Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as PC20. Coefficient of variation of baseline FEV1 within the study day was less than 7 percent in all. The trough of FEV1 variation by cosinor analysis ranged from 02.50 to 11.99 h (mean, 05.66). All had both significant (p less than 0.05) or marginally significant (0.05 less than p less than 0.1) cosinusoidal rhythm of PC20 and two or more doubling concentration differences between the highest and lowest PC20s. The trough of PC20 variation ranged from 16.32 to 02.87 h (mean, 22.30). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) difference between troughs of FEV1 and PC20 variations. We conclude that the peak of circadian variation of bronchial responsiveness precedes the trough of circadian variation of bronchial caliber in asthmatic children.\r"

  ".U": "91364467\r", 
  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) may play a key role in human respiratory immune defenses, partially by synthesizing and releasing interleukin 1 (IL = 1). D53 (Ribomunyl), a composite bacterial ribosomal immunostimulant, has been recognized as an efficient prevention of respiratory tract infections. In vitro, D53 enhances the IL-1 production by mouse spleen adherent cells. A thymocyte proliferative response assay was used to evaluate the in vitro IL-1 production by AMs in healthy subjects who received D53 immunostimulant. Twelve nonsmoking healthy subjects took part in a prospective double-blind placebo control study. On day 1, a first bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to assess IL-1 production by unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated AM. Then, subjects were randomized to receive D53 (n = 6) or its placebo (n = 6) by both oral and subcutaneous injection routes from day 1 to day 15. On day 15, a second BAL was done and AM IL-1 production was again tested. IL-1 production on day 15 did not significantly differ from day 1 in both D53-treated and placebo groups either when AMs were unstimulated or were stimulated with concentrations of LPS resulting in maximal IL-1 production. However, in the D53-treated group, but not in the placebo group, IL-1 production induced by low LPS concentration (5 mg/L) was significantly higher (mean +/- SEM: 1,238 +/- 287 U/10(6) AM) on day 15 in comparison with day 1 (577 +/- 113 U/10(6) AM; p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon W test) and in comparison with the control group (day 15 IL-1 production induced by 5 mg/L LPS, 758 +/- 175 U/10(6) AM; p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, in the D53-treated group, the optimal LPS concentration (ie, LPS concentration that induced maximal IL-1 production) was significantly lower on day 15 (mean +/- SD: 11 +/- 7 mg/L) than on day 1 (16 +/- 7 mg/L; p less than 0.05 Wilcoxon W test). We conclude that D53 immunostimulant in vivo primes AM to produce IL-1 following low LPS concentration stimulation. This may partially explain the protective effect of D53 immunostimulant against respiratory tract infection.\r"

We postulated that beyond the simple fun of camp, attendance at camp might improve the clinical status and self-image of the campers. We therefore studied lung function, nutrition, and self-image in 45 children between the ages 6 and 12 years after a two-week CF summer camp. Although there was a 10 percent fall in respiratory rate during camp, spirometry did not change significantly. There were, however, significant gains in weight, skin fold thickness, and midarm circumference after two weeks at camp, and these increases were positively correlated with the number of pancreatic enzymes taken daily by the child. The Primary Self-Concept Inventory test was completed by each camper on the first and last days of camp. Although there was a trend toward increasing self-concept during camp, this did not reach statistical significance. Two weeks' attendance at summer camp appears to be associated with improved nutrition in children with CF. This may be due to increased emphasis on weight gain and appropriate use of pancreatic enzymes or to other factors, like avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure, that are unique to the summer camp setting.\r"

Eleven of these 18 patients immediately improved (S group). This procedure was unsuccessful in other seven patients (F group). Thirteen patients survived (72 percent). The time lag between the first episode of pulmonary embolism and ECD was significantly shorter in the S group than in the F group (4.7 +/- 5.4 days vs 18.3 +/- 6.9 days, p = 0.0004). So was the elapsed time between the onset of hemodynamic impairment and ECD (13 +/- 12 hours vs 59 +/- 38 hours, p = 0.003). We conclude that ECD should be considered when other treatments are impossible especially when the first symptoms date back less than 15 days and the hemodynamic impairment less than 48 h.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) desaturate during sleep and during exercise but by different mechanisms. To determine the need for supplemental oxygen, many centers measure resting and exercise arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). We examined the associations among resting, sleep, and exercise SaO2 to ascertain the validity of this approach. We studied 21 adult and adolescent CF patients, eight of whom were hypoxemic (SaO2 less than 95 percent; group A) and 13 of whom were nonhypoxemic (SaO2 greater than or equal to 95 percent; group B) by overnight oximetry and treadmill exercise testing. The whole group desaturated more during sleep than during exercise, the change in SaO2 being 10.59 +/- 8.35 vs 6.25 +/- 4.44 (p less than 0.002). Group B desaturated significantly more during sleep than during exercise, with a reduction in SaO2 of 7.9 +/- 3.3 vs 3.3 +/- 1.49 (p less than 0.05). Group A desaturated more during exercise than group B, with a reduction of 11 +/- 3.2 vs 3.3 +/- 1.5 (p less than 0.001). Despite a strong correlation between awake SaO2 and mean sleep SaO2 (r = 0.68; p less than 0.001), minimum sleep SaO2 (r = 0.55; p less than 0.01), and minimum exercise SaO2 (r = 0.92; p less than 0.001), there was no correlation between awake SaO2 and sleep-related desaturation or between exercise- and sleep-related desaturation. In conclusion, clinically significant oxygen desaturation during sleep may be missed unless specifically checked in CF patients, and awake and exercise SaO2 may not give an indication of the degree of sleep-related desaturation.\r"

Subjects were recruited from outpatient clinics at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire which asked about their general health and any recent symptoms of illness. Medical records were also audited for all participants to provide additional information on medical history and known risk factors for Legionella infection. Single samples of serum were obtained from each subject, and antibody titers to L pneumophila serogroups 1 through 6 were assayed. Three hundred ninety-six subjects were enrolled in the study. They had a mean age of 67 years, and 98 percent were male subjects. Overall, 36 percent of the subjects had positive antibody titers (greater than or equal to 1:128) to L pneumophila. There were no differences between those with and without elevated titers with respect to recent systemic symptoms or other previously established risk factors for legionellosis. We conclude that positive anti-Legionella antibodies are a frequent occurrence among these outpatients. This has important implications for the interpretation of single or static antibody titers from patients who are acutely ill.\r"

Initial CXR and CT scans were interpreted independently by radiologists in a blinded fashion. CXR diagnosed more bony injuries than CT, while the CT identified pulmonary contusions and effusions more accurately. Only those contusions diagnosed by CXR proved clinically significant. Patient treatment was changed in one case based on CT findings. In the absence of CXR findings, chest CT scanning frequently identifies abnormalities with limited clinical significance. Although more sensitive, CT of the thorax has a limited role in the initial emergent evaluation of victims of blunt torso trauma.\r"

After treatment with budesonide, the response to both inhaled histamine and bradykinin was decreased when compared with placebo. The PD35 histamine was increased by 1.95 doubling doses and PD35 bradykinin by 2.1 doubling doses. Daily (PEF) recordings were significantly increased during budesonide therapy, the morning PEF by 34.8 +/- 14.1 L/min and evening by 50.3 +/- 23.1 L/min. Baseline laboratory lung function on the study days was not altered by budesonide nor were symptom records altered significantly. Inhaled budesonide therefore inhibits to the same extent the exaggerated response to both directly acting histamine and bradykinin which acts through airway nerves.\r"

Eighteen percent of cases with miliary, meningeal and peritoneal TB were diagnosed at death, compared with 4.8 percent among those with pulmonary TB.

The daily dose used was 400 mg during the one-year period. Patients were clinically evaluated every month and tested for mycosis every three months. All patients except for one showed negative cultures on the third month after treatment began. Effectiveness achieved was excellent in eight patients (50 percent); a very good response was found in seven patients (44 percent); no response was seen in one patient (6 percent). There were four (25 percent) relapses and one dropout. Side effects seen were high blood pressure (19 percent) and lower limb edema (6 percent), which was temporary and at no time required discontinuing the drug therapy. We believe that itraconazole is an effective drug to treat coccidioidomycosis with a wide safety margin. It is well tolerated, and the incidence of relapses was low.\r"

Antibody response against whole culture filtrate and P32 antigen increased after a three-month period of treatment.

A serologic test using P32 as the antigen seems to allow a better discrimination between active and healed tuberculosis.\r"

TIA was examined by intravenously injecting plasma from the patients into BALB/c mice. The plasma containing TIA induced multiple thromboses in the lung and caused the mice to die 3 to 30 minutes after injection. The subjects were 19 patients whose plasma contained no TIA before operation. TIA was detected in 5.3 percent (1/19) on the first postoperative day (POD), 47.4 percent (9/19) on the seventh POD, 47.1 percent (8/17) on the 14th POD, 26.7 percent (4/15) on the 21st POD, and 20 percent (2/10) on the 28th POD. Plasma fibrinogen levels and peripheral platelet counts increased postoperatively and reached a maximum on the seventh and 14th POD, respectively. Peripheral blood with TIA had a significant elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels and platelet counts as compared to that without TIA. These observations suggest that TIA is present in blood in a hypercoagulable state in patients after pulmonary resection. Since tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 are known to induce hypercoagulable states both in vitro and in vivo, we tried to determine whether it was possible to detect both cytokines in blood indicated as hypercoagulable state by the presence of TIA. They did not, however, reach detectable levels in the blood.\r"

General physical examination and the determination of spirometric parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) were conducted in 400 primary school children between ages 9 and 11 years who reside in one control and three polluted areas. A survey using ATS-DLD-78-C questionnaire indicated that there were no significant differences in their demographic characteristics among children in the four areas under study. Those who had nonrespiratory diseases that might affect pulmonary function and those who failed to perform spirometric measurements were excluded from the study; therefore, 382 children were included in data analysis. The results revealed that (1) the mean values of FVC and FEV1 (expressed as percentage of predicted values calculated from Polgar's equations) in the polluted areas were significantly lower than the nonpolluted area (p less than 0.05), and (2) the incidence of pulmonary function abnormality in the polluted areas was greater than that of the nonpolluted area (p less than 0.05). The results indicated that air pollution produced by wire reclamation incineration can impair children's pulmonary function.\r"

Although the measurement of serum alpha 1AT levels is not difficult, there is no international standard for alpha 1AT, and investigators in the field recognize that widely used commercially available standards vary by as much as 50 percent. To establish accurate ranges for the common normal and deficient alpha 1AT phenotypes, the present study uses a purified alpha 1AT standard to quantify the alpha 1AT serum levels of 443 individuals with common normal and deficient alpha 1AT phenotypes, including MM, ZZ, SS, MZ, MS, and SZ. Based on the observed values, a statistical model was developed to generate predicted frequency distributions of alpha 1AT serum levels for each of these phenotypes. Based on these studies, the ranges (5th to 95th percentile) for alpha 1AT serum levels of the common phenotypes are: MM, 20 to 53 mumol/L; SS, 20 to 48 mumol/L; ZZ, 3.4 to 7.0 mumol/L; MZ, 15 to 42 mumol/L; MS, 18 to 52 mumol/L; and SZ, 10 to 23 mumol/L. This alpha 1AT standard and these ranges are being used for the National alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry organized under the auspices of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\r"

All ten were white and carried their pregnancies to term without incident. Decreases in total lymphocytes and T-helper and T-suppressor subsets were noted during the third trimester, presumably secondary to an increase in plasma volume. Lymphocyte responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed were mildly decreased late in pregnancy, with significant intrasubject and intersubject variation. Responses to tetanus antigen were consistently and significantly lower as pregnancy progressed, rising above first trimester levels by 12 weeks postpartum. A similar pattern of response was noted with spherulin antigen for the seven subjects with previously demonstrated coccidioidal immunity. The three subjects with active coccidioidomycosis either failed to mount a significant spherulin immune response or demonstrated an early response that fell as pregnancy progressed. This antigen-specific immune suppression continued for up to 16 months postpartum despite the fact that there was no clinical evidence of coccidioidal activity beyond the first trimester. Thus, while all three completed pregnancy without complication, the data suggest that significantly increased maternal risk may be present when active coccidioidomycosis and pregnancy occur together. This risk may be greatest among darker-skinned individuals who become infected during the latter half of pregnancy.\r"

PATIENTS: Fifteen patients had positive sputum cultures for M gordonae: five patients had AIDS or had HIV-1 infections with less than or equal to 180 CD4 cells/cu mm, and ten patients had no clinical evidence of HIV-1 infection. RESULTS: Three of the five HIV-1 infected patients had clinical, roentgenographic, and microbiologic evidence of pulmonary infection due to M gordonae that responded to antimycobacterial therapy. One of the two remaining HIV-1 infected patients had disseminated M tuberculosis and possible coinfection with M gordonae, and the other was lost to follow-up. None of the ten patients without evidence of HIV-1 infection was considered to have M gordonae respiratory tract infection.

Intraobserver and interobserver LVEF and RVEF measurement reproducibility was high. During quiet, supine wakefulness, LVEF was normal, but RVEF was low. During sleep, a decrease in both LVEF and RVEF, expressed as a percentage of the awake value, was marked in the two children with the most nocturnal desaturation and longest duration of paradoxic rib cage motion during inspiration. It is concluded that radionuclide ventriculography can be easily performed during sleep in children and can provide useful information regarding right ventricular function during sleep in children with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

DESIGN: We used discharge diagnosis and procedure codes in 1983 to 1985 Medicare hospital (part A) claims records to identify patients who underwent lung resection for lung cancer; we assessed perioperative, one-year, and two-year survival using Medicare enrollment file data. PATIENTS: From a nationally random sample of 1,138,000 Medicare beneficiaries over 65 years of age, we identified 1,290 individuals who fulfilled our definition for lung resection for lung cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall perioperative (30-day) mortality was 7.4 percent. Postoperative survival at one and two years was 69 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Male sex, older age, and pneumonectomy, as opposed to a lesser procedure, were associated with reduced perioperative and one-year and two-year survival. The adverse effect of advanced age on one-year and two-year survival following lung resection was not explained by the lower life expectancy of older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims data can be used to estimate likely outcomes for elderly patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Expected outcomes vary with the patient's age, sex, and the type of surgical procedure performed.\r"

All indices decreased progressively with increasing orthostasis: peak acceleration (PKA): 15.6 +/- 4.5 m/s2 to 14.0 +/- 4.0 m/s2 to 13.6 +/- 4.6 m/s2; peak velocity (PKV): 0.64 +/- 0.18 m/s to 0.58 +/- 0.17 m/s to 0.56 +/- 0.17 m/s; stroke distance (SD): 11.4 +/- 3.7 cm to 9.8 +/- 3.4 cm to 8.0 +/- 2.8 cm; SD x heart rate (VIH): 717 +/- 272 cm to 655 +/- 268 cm to 572 +/- 217 cm, from supine to sitting to standing, respectively (p less than 0.001). In contrast heart rate increased modestly from 62.4 +/- 10.0 bpm supine, to 66.9 +/- 12.4 bpm sitting, to 71.3 +/- 9.9 bpm standing (p less than .001). Similar postural changes in Doppler variables were seen in all three age groups (20 to 44 years; 45 to 64 years; and 65 to 86 years). Thus, orthostasis in normal subjects is accompanied by a reduction in all continuous-wave Doppler indices of left ventricular performance, regardless of age.\r"

The study population consisted of two groups; group A was comprised of 12 patients with a spontaneous left bundle branch block, and group B had 12 patients without left bundle branch block. All the patients underwent an interrogation of the mitral valve inflow by Doppler echocardiography, in order to measure isovolumic relaxation time, early and late peak velocity (E and A wave), E/A ratio and deceleration time. The study was performed at spontaneous rhythm and after, inhibition of the pacemaker. In group A, there were no changes in the Doppler parameters when passing from a spontaneous to an 80/min electrically induced rhythm. Analysis of group B revealed a statistically significant lengthening of IVR and Dec t with electrical stimulation. No statistically significant differences were found when we compared the Doppler parameters of the two populations at the same pacing frequency. Right ventricular pacing causes interventricular asynchrony and abnormalities in diastolic filling times, which resulted in a lengthening of either IVR and Dec t, simulating a pattern of abnormal relaxation.\r"

All subjects had neither an ischemic electrocardiographic response nor chest pain during maximal treadmill exercise. The DT and heart rate (HR) had an inverse nonlinear relation, and electromechanical systole (QS2) and HR had an inverse linear relation during exercise. When the exercise DT-HR and QS2-HR relations were compared, a significant lengthening of QS2, with a consequent shortening of DT, was observed in diabetic patients with retinopathy, compared to patients without retinopathy and normal subjects (p less than 0.005), while no significant differences were found between diabetic patients without retinopathy and normal subjects; however, there were no significant differences in the exercise DT-HR and QS2-HR relations among diabetic patients with and without autonomic dysfunction and normal subjects. A more prominent abbreviation in the diastolic perfusion time observed in patients with retinopathy would be meaningful because microangiopathy might already have limited subendocardial blood flow. Thus, patients with type 2 diabetes who have retinopathy have a potential risk of aggravation of left ventricular function through the deterioration of myocardial blood flow.\r"

Chest roentgenograms and CT scans were taken in the same ventilatory conditions (apnea at 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]); blood gas samples and hemodynamic parameters were collected at the same time. Roentgenographic analysis was undertaken by independent observers using two standardized scoring systems proposed in the literature. CT scan analysis was performed using the CT number frequency distribution and the gas lung volume (measured by helium dilution technique) to estimate quantitatively the lung density, the lung weight, and the percentage of normally aerated and nonaerated tissue. Knowing the mean CT number of the pulmonary parenchyma in a group of normal subjects, we also inferred the ideal lung weight expected in the study population and computed the excess tissue mass as the difference between actual and ideal lung weight. Both the roentgenographic scoring systems showed direct correlation with the pulmonary impairment as detected by CT scan densitometric analysis (CT number, percentage of nonaerated tissue, lung weight, and excess tissue mass; p less than 0.01) and inverse relation with the percentage of normally aerated tissue (p less than 0.01). We also found a relationship between roentgenographic scores and the impairment in gas exchange as detected by shunt fraction (p less than 0.05). We conclude that standardized reading of portable chest roentgenograms by means of scoring tables is a valuable tool in estimating the amount of pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a highly invasive therapy for intractable neonatal respiratory failure, and serious complications may occur with increasing duration of bypass. Weaning from bypass is empirical at present. Thus, there is a need to accurately predict when infants can be successfully decannulated. We hypothesized that pulmonary mechanics would reflect lung recovery and, therefore, predict successful weaning from ECMO. We measured pulmonary mechanics daily in 22 neonates, at gestational age of 37.8 +/- 0.6 weeks (SE) requiring ECMO for severe respiratory failure (oxygen index 66 +/- 6). Pulmonary resistance (Rpul), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), and tidal volume (VT) were measured. Rpul did not predict lung recovery. Cdyn within 24 hours of starting ECMO was 0.3 +/- 0.04 ml/cm H2O. Cdyn within 24 hours of weaning from ECMO was 1.2 +/- 0.09 ml/cm H2O (p less than 0.001). All 22 infants had Cdyn greater than 0.6 ml/cm H2O at the time of decannulation, but four infants (20 percent) with Cdyn less than 0.6 ml/cm H2O could not be weaned from ECMO within 20 hours (p less than 0.01). Thus, a minimum Cdyn of 0.6 ml/cm H2O is associated with successful weaning from ECMO. Cdyn of 0.8 ml/cm H2O provided better overall discrimination between those who could be successfully weaned from ECMO. We conclude that serial measurement of dynamic pulmonary compliance predicts successful weaning from ECMO.\r"

  ".W": "Intubation and mechanical ventilation are well-established techniques in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure; however, there are situations in which these procedures cannot be used safely for various reasons. A recently described noninvasive technique, nasal positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), has been developed for home ventilation of certain patients with chronic ventilatory insufficiency. We hypothesized that NPPV could be used in selected patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation were clearly indicated, but not immediately possible, or even contraindicated. Six patients were treated with NPPV during an episode of acute respiratory failure and enrolled in a prospective study. We found that NPPV was successful in avoiding intubation, but only in the three patients suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disorder, whereas the procedure was unsuccessful in patients with obstructive disorders. Moreover, in every patient, acute NPPV was very time-consuming for the nursing staff: in patients with restrictive disorders, a nurse had to monitor a patient submitted to NPPV during 41 +/- 9 percent of the duration of ventilation and during 91 +/- 9 percent of the NPPV time in patients with obstructive disorders. We conclude that acute NPPV may be attempted in selected patients with acute respiratory failure, predominantly patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, but that this procedure is very time-consuming for nurses.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a novel regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in patients requiring prolonged (at least five days) mechanical ventilation. The design was a controlled, prospective, randomized trial, with blinded comparison of the groups regarding the incidence of respiratory tract infection in an intensive care unit of a university hospital. After determination of the APACHE II score for severity of disease, 88 patients were randomly divided in three groups. Twenty-four of these patients did not complete five days of mechanical ventilation, and eight were withdrawn for other reasons. Fifty-six patients (18 in group 1, 21 in group 2, 17 in group 3) completed the study. Patients in both control groups 1 and 2 did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis, but the two groups differed in the antibiotic policy in case of infection. Patients in group 3 received antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of norfloxacin, polymyxin E, and amphotericin B, applied topically in oropharynx and stomach from time of ICU admission until extubation, and intravenous cefotaxime 500 mg three times a day during the first five days of admission. In both control groups, about 90 percent of the patients acquired microbial colonization of oropharynx or stomach. In group 3, only 12 percent and 24 percent of the patients acquired colonization of oropharynx and stomach, respectively (p less than 0.001). This resulted in a reduction of the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection (78 percent in group 1, 62 percent in group 2, 6 percent in group 3 [p = 0.0001]). The regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis studied prevented respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in all patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation.\r"

Twelve stable subjects with CAO (FEV1 = 1.30 +/- 0.47 L) underwent incremental symptom-limited exercise tests 90 minutes following the ingestion of 920 calories of EnsurePlus HN (E), 920 calories of Pulmocare (P), or a noncaloric placebo (C). Tests were performed on three days, in a double-blind randomized fashion. Expired gases were collected continuously and analyzed every 30 seconds. The mean maximal work load after E (81 +/- 24 W) was significantly less than that after P (88 +/- 21 W) or C (88 +/- 24 W). The mean ventilation at exhaustion was similar after E (48 +/- 13 L/min), P (51 +/- 11 L/min), and C (49 +/- 10 L/min). In comparison to C, six of the 12 individuals had a decreased work load following E, while only one had a decreased maximal tolerated work load following P. The results of this study suggest that meals with a higher fat and lower carbohydrate content may be less likely to impair work performance of patients with CAO in the absorptive phase than meals with a lower fat and higher carbohydrate content. These findings may have clinical significance to patients with CAO who complain of postprandial exertional dyspnea.\r"

  ".U": "91364497\r", 
  ".W": "In a canine model of pulmonary embolism (PE) produced by infusion of autologous blood clots, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased to 73 +/- 4 mm Hg while cardiac output (CO) decreased to less than 50 percent of baseline. Intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PHEN) and norepinephrine (NE) restored MAP to somewhat above baseline values. However, only NE restored CO to control levels. The right ventricular myocardial blood flow increased 15 percent in the PE group with PHEN and 229 percent with NE at equipressor concentrations. The right ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption (RVMVo2) was not significantly different between PE and PE + PHEN while PE + NE increased RVMVO2 by 144 percent to 20.2 +/- 1.8 ml/min/100 g. The RV output was not adequately restored with PE, but when RV contractility was augmented with NE, RV output was restored to baseline. Right ventricular minute work increased 100 percent with NE and was maintained with a 100 percent increase in oxygen consumption. Calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was decreased during PE by 36 percent with PE + PHEN while PVR in NE-treated dogs decreased by 59 percent. In NE-treated animals, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was restored to control levels while in PHEN-treated animals SVR increased about 75 percent from baseline. We conclude that the salutary effects of NE on RV output are due to both alpha and beta receptor stimulation, which increased contractility, RVMBF, and RVMVo2, and decreased both PVR and SVR. In the PHEN-treated dogs, our indices of minute-work, RVMBF, and RVMVo2 suggest that coronary autoregulation was intact; however, there was no apparent benefit to RV output. This study suggests that in the clinical setting of acute PE, the judicious use of NE, rather than PHEN, may be more beneficial in restoring RV function and systemic hemodynamics.\r"

Since the onset of shock greatly worsens prognosis and to encourage early intervention, the term sepsis syndrome was developed to describe the features of a preshock septic state. Early clinical and metabolic indicators are discussed, and current therapy is reviewed. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of endotoxin release from Gram-negative bacteria and advances in biotechnology have led to the development of potential new treatments for sepsis. One such development--monoclonal antibodies to endotoxin--has shown great promise in the effort to block the progression to septic shock, reduce mortality, and decrease the overall costs of sepsis to the patient and to the national economy.\r"

  ".W": "Itraconazole is a new orally active antifungal triazole with impressive activity against Aspergillus spp. Six patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aged 14 to 49 years, were treated with oral itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) for a mean of 3.9 months (range, one to six months; three patients continue on therapy). Two patients received two courses. Three patients had underlying cystic fibrosis, and three had severe asthma; four of the six required continuous high-dose systemic prednisone (mean, 43 mg/day; confidence interval [CI], 23 to 63 mg/day) at the start of therapy. In those treated for two months or longer, the mean total serum IgE level fell from 2,462 U/ml (CI, 752 to 4,202 U/ml) to 502 U/ml (CI, 123 to 880 U/ml) during each course, and the mean daily steroid dosage was decreased to a mean of 24 mg/day (CI, 11 to 37 mg/day). All patients experienced improvement in pulmonary function during the trial, with mean FEV, increasing from 1.43 to 1.77L/sec and mean FVC from 2.3 to 2.9 L in those treated for two months or longer. The mean steady-state serum concentration of itraconazole was 5.1 micrograms/ml (range, 1.8 micrograms/ml to 7.3 micrograms/ml); the patient with the lowest concentrations had the least significant clinical response. Cultures of sputum from two of three patients became negative for A fumigatus during therapy. No adverse clinical effects occurred except loss of libido in one patient. We conclude that oral itraconazole may be an effective adjunctive therapy in ABPA, possibly by clearing the airway of Aspergillus, and that randomized trials of this agent are warranted to better define its usefulness in this disorder.\r"

Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids.\r"

Fifteen infants had pathological levels of gastroesophageal reflux on esophageal pH monitoring, and 9 had normal study results (symptomatic controls). Partition of sleep stages, sleep efficiency, and frequency of arousals to electroencephalographic stage 0 were the same in both groups. During sleeping reflux episodes, defined as reflux starting during sleep stages 1-5 or reflux episodes consisting of greater than 50% of sleep stages 1-5, there was a 50% decrease in the amount of stage 0 electroencephalogram pattern compared with nonreflux sleep, and a compensatory increase in the non-rapid eye movement sleep stages. Reflux onsets in patients with pathological reflux were evenly divided between stages 0, 1/2, and 5. Onset of reflux occurred rarely during sleep stages 3 and 4. Slight body movement accompanied the onset of 62.5% of sleep reflux episodes in symptomatic controls and 64.7% in patients with pathological gastroesophageal reflux. Arousals to stage 0 electroencephalogram occurred with equal frequency in sleep reflux episodes of symptomatic controls and patients, and frequency did not increase over the observed value for nonreflux time. There were no differences between the sleep patterns of infants with and without pathological gastroesophageal reflux; nor were there decreases in arousals from sleep in infants with pathological reflux. However, reflux occurring during sleep in all infants studied was characterized by a significant decrease in stage 0 (waking) electroencephalogram.\r"

  ".W": "In cystic fibrosis, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated chloride secretion is abnormal in respiratory, small intestinal, and rectal mucosa. Calcium-mediated chloride secretion is also aberrant in CF small intestinal mucosa in cystic fibrosis, in contrast to the respiratory epithelia, where it appears to be normal. To determine whether this disparity between calcium- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated chloride secretion exists in cystic fibrosis rectal mucosa in vivo, transrectal potential difference was measured in age-matched adult cystic fibrosis subjects (n = 8) and control subjects (n = 9) in response to 10-minute luminal perfusions of bethanechol (1 mmol/L) or theophylline (5 mmol/L). In response to bethanechol, an initial (1-minute) negative change in potential difference (-1.4 +/- 1.1 mV; mean +/- SEM) was seen in control subjects, in contrast to a positive change in mean potential difference (+2.5 +/- 1.0 mV) in cystic fibrosis subjects (control vs. cystic fibrosis, P less than 0.05). After 1 minute, mean potential differences changes in both control and cystic fibrosis subjects were positive. Theophylline perfusion resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in potential difference response between groups; at 10 minutes, the potential difference became more negative (-3.6 +/- 1.4 mV) in control subjects and more positive in cystic fibrosis subjects (+3.9 +/- 1.4 mV). To determine whether second messenger-mediated potassium secretion contributed to the observed potential difference changes in response to bethanechol and theophylline, studies were repeated in the presence of barium chloride, a known blocker of potassium conductance. In the control group, barium chloride significantly enhanced the theophylline-induced negative potential difference change (P less than 0.05) and reduced the positive potential difference change seen with bethanechol alone. In subjects with cystic fibrosis, barium chloride completely abolished the previously seen positive potential difference change in response to either bethanechol or theophylline alone. These in vivo studies suggest that there is active potassium secretion in both control and cystic fibrosis rectal mucosa in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate- and calcium-dependent secretagogues and that the magnitude of the potential difference changes attributable to barium-inhibitable potassium secretion is the same in cystic fibrosis and control subjects. In contrast, it appears that in cystic fibrosis rectal mucosa in vivo, calcium- as well as cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent chloride secretion is aberrant.\r"

  ".W": "Normal human lamina propria lymphocytes are in a heightened state of activation compared with peripheral blood with regard to cell-surface activation antigen expression (transferrin receptor, interleukin-2 receptor, 4F2) and the increased spontaneous secretion of immunoglobulins in vitro. This study evaluates the cell-surface expression of activation-associated antigens in different subpopulations of isolated colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells in inflammatory bowel disease. In pilot studies using three-color flow cytometry, autofluorescence was observed that was emitted by unstained lamina propria mononuclear cells, which interfered with both the sensitivity and the specificity of the analyses. Because a major portion of the intestinal lymphocyte populations of interest were autofluorescent, a method to remove autofluorescence signals was developed by designing a computer program for the subtraction of autofluorescence from the emissions of each individual cell. This technique increases both the sensitivity and specificity of flow-cytometric analyses of intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analyses with subtraction of autofluorescence on a single-cell basis, increased expression of lymphocyte activation antigens (interleukin-2 receptor, transferrin receptor, 4F2) was found on the cell surface of isolated intestinal B cells, T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therefore, markedly increased intestinal lymphocyte activation is a major immunological alteration in inflammatory bowel disease and includes all lymphocyte subpopulations investigated in this study. In addition, 5-aminosalicylic acid, which is used for the treatment of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease, inhibits the expression of cell-surface activation antigens on mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that lymphocyte activation may play an important role in underlying immune processes that lead to chronicity and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease and may implicate an additional mechanism for the therapeutic action of 5-aminosalicylic acid.\r"

Intravenous injection of diazepam (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased the secretion; this stimulation was abolished by proximal bilateral vagotomy. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist that also has well-known intrinsic activity, caused similar stimulation of the secretion when administered IV (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg). Intracerebroventricular infusion of Ro 15-1788 (10 micrograms/h) resulted in a greater increase in secretion; again, this stimulation was prevented by vagotomy. Adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine increased basal alkaline secretion but did not affect the stimulation by diazepam. The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine (2.5 mg/kg IV) did not affect the duodenal bicarbonate secretion. For comparison, effects of diazepam and Ro 15-1788 (10(-6)-10(-4) mol/L) were also tested in isolated bullfrog duodenal mucosa. Neither drug effected the alkaline secretion in vitro. The combined results strongly suggest that benzodiazepines, as previously shown for certain brain peptides, influence the central nervous control of duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and that their stimulation of secretion is vagally mediated. This action benzodiazepines might be used in modulating mucosal protection against acid.\r"

At the same time, bacterial samples were collected from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The tests and gastrointestinal aspirates were performed before and during tetracycline therapy. Crystalline vitamin B12 was absorbed to the same extent in the two study groups. Atrophic gastritis subjects absorbed significantly less protein-bound vitamin B12 than normal controls (mean +/- SEM, 0.7% +/- 0.2% vs. 1.9% +/- 0.5%, respectively). However, protein-bound vitamin B12 absorption in these subjects normalized after antibiotic therapy.

Concurrent treatment with pharmacological inhibitors, which specifically block chloride secretion, may be a useful adjunct to oral fluid therapy. To examine this hypothesis, the authors determined the intestinal water and ion transport rates in rat small intestine during the secretory phase induced by perfusion with N6-2'-0-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP), 1.0 mmol/L. A marker (polyethylene glycol 4000) dilution technique was used to evaluate the antisecretory effects of a defined short-chain glucose polymer, D-glucose, and a chloride channel blocker, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (A-9-C). The results showed that dbcAMP induced small intestinal water and chloride ion secretion rapidly and reliably. The 2.5% concentration of rice short glucose polymer (G2, 22.7%; G3, 28.2%; G4, 14.0%; G5, 16.6%; G6, 11.6%; G7-9, 6.9%) is a better carbohydrate than the 2.5% concentration of D-glucose in reversing secretion of water, chloride, and sodium ions induced by dbcAMP. The combination of A-9-C and the glucose polymer can reverse dbcAMP-induced intestinal secretion and produces significantly (P less than 0.05) better antisecretory effect on water, sodium, and chloride ions than D-glucose with A-9-C.\r"

In the liver, neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers were distributed richly in Glisson's sheath and were prominent around the walls of the interlobular vein, interlobular hepatic artery, and hepatic bile duct. The fibers also formed a dense network surrounding the hepatocytes. The nerve terminals were found close to the endothelial cells of blood vessels, as well as being distributed in Disse's space, where they appeared to terminate. Occasionally these terminals contacted directly the membrane of a hepatocyte. In the gallbladder, neuropeptide Y fibers were found in each layer, with an especially dense network in the lamina propria. The fibers also ran close to the epithelium and parallel to the muscle bundles. Blood vessels throughout the gallbladder were well supplied with such nerve fibers. In the pancreas, neuropeptide Y fibers were found mainly near blood vessels and partly in gaps between exocrine glands, seeming to terminate on certain endocrine cells. Nerve terminals were located in the vascular walls and adjacent to the surface of exocrine acinar cells. These studies provide a basis for correlating the neuropeptide Y distribution with pharmacological and physiological studies in humans.\r"

The current study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the frequency and type of complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for other conditions. Four hundred twenty-three patients underwent sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (166), common duct stone(s) (163), tumor (60), and miscellaneous reasons (34). Patients were observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours after the procedure, and 30-day follow-up data were obtained. The overall complication rate was 6.9%, but complications were more frequent when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for all other indications (10.8% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.009). Precut sphincterotomy was more frequently required in the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group (21.1% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.009) but was no more likely to result in a complication (6.2%) than standard sphincterotomy. The risk of a complication was considerable for a small-diameter common bile duct (less than or equal to 5 mm), particularly when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (37.5%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7%, but the procedure-related mortality rate was believed to be 0.2%. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is more hazardous than for other conditions, particularly when a small common bile duct is present.\r"

The distance of labeled liver cells from the portal space was determined, after 1 hour and 30 days, in control and azathioprine-treated rats. In the control group, the streaming velocities of hepatocytes and littoral cells were 3.2 microns/day and 3.1 microns/day, respectively. In azathioprine-treated animals, the respective velocities were 7.0 microns/day and 5.5 microns/day. In the liver acinus, cell displacement velocity is proportional to cell production. Because hepatocyte velocity in azathioprine-treated animals increased by 218% and littoral cell velocity by 177%, their respective turnovers also increased to 218% and 177%. It can be concluded that the liver is essentially a slowly renewing cell population. Azathioprine increased the hepatocytes' and littoral cells' streaming velocities. This in vivo experimental model may help evaluate the effect of hepatotoxic drugs on the kinetics of liver cells.\r"

In the present study, 106 cirrhotics were randomized to sclerotherapy (55 patients) or control group (51 patients). Admission criteria were no history of previous variceal bleeding and the presence of high-risk varices, i.e., a variceal score less than or equal to 0 according to Beppu et al. Sclerotherapy sessions were performed at time zero, 7 days, 30 days, and then monthly until eradication. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 6-month intervals thereafter. Control patients underwent repeat endoscopy at 6-month intervals. Bleeding episodes were treated by sclerotherapy in both groups, whenever possible. Mean follow-up was 24 months. Analysis of the results was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Variceal bleeding occurred in 19 sclerotherapy patients (34.5%) and in 17 controls (35.4%, P = NS). Overall mortality was 34.5% in sclerotherapy patients and 50% in controls (P = NS). Seven of the 19 sclerotherapy patients (36.8%) and 11 of the 17 controls (64.7%) who bled died of hemorrhage (P less than 0.05, log-linear model). It is concluded that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotics. However, there seems to be a trend toward a lower bleeding-related mortality in sclerotherapy patients than in controls.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study the transport of glutamine across rat liver basolateral membrane was examined with special emphasis on the existence of an Na(+)-independent system and on the characteristics of the Na(+)-dependent system with respect to stoichiometry of glutamine to Na+. Well-validated and purified liver basolateral membrane vesicles were used in the study. Results of studies on the effect of incubation medium osmolarity and incubation temperature indicated that glutamine uptake by liver basolateral membrane vesicles is largely the result of transport of the substrate into the intravesicular compartment with little binding to basolateral membrane vesicles. Transport of glutamine with time was Na+ gradient dependent (out greater than in) with a distinct \"overshoot\" phenomenon. Replacing Na+ with an equivalent concentration of K+, NH4+, choline, or mannitol caused significant inhibition of the initial rate of glutamine transport; on the other hand, Li+ could partially substitute for Na+. The initial rate of transport of glutamine as a function of concentration (0.05-12 mmol/L) was saturable both in the presence and in the absence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. Apparent Km values of 2.95 and 3.35 mmol/L and Vmax values of 11,565 and 6663 pmol.mg protein-1.10s-1 were calculated in the presence and absence of a Na+ gradient, respectively. Both in the presence and absence of an Na+ gradient (out greater than in), transport of [3H]glutamine was significantly inhibited by the addition to the incubation medium of unlabeled glutamine as well as histidine, asparagine, and serine. Transport of glutamine by the Na(+)-dependent process was significantly inhibited or stimulated, respectively, by inducing a relatively positive or negative intravesicular space. On the other hand, glutamine transport by the Na(+)-independent process was not affected by changes in transmembrane electrical potential. Using the \"activation method,\" the stoichiometry of glutamine Na+ transport was found to be 1:1. These results show that glutamine transport in rat liver basolateral membrane vesicles is carrier mediated both in the presence and absence of an Na+ gradient. Furthermore, the Na(+)-dependent process is electrogenic in nature (net positive) and cotransports one glutamine molecule with one Na+. Transport of glutamine by the Na(+)-independent system, on the other hand, is electroneutral in nature.\r"

Dexamethasone increased ornithine decarboxylase activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations in a time-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 12 hours (207% +/- 63% and 327% +/- 34% of control, respectively; n = 5). Ornithine decarboxylase mRNA levels returned to control values at 48 hours, whereas ornithine decarboxylase activity was decreased to 41% +/- 8% of control (n = 3). Dexamethasone induction of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA was dose dependent, with half-maximal effects at 10(-8) mol/L (210% +/- 20% of control; n = 4) and maximal effects at 10(-7) mol/L (327% +/- 26% of control; n = 4). The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486 blocked the dexamethasone effects in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effects occurring at 10(-7) mol/L (120% +/- 18% of control; n = 3). When protein synthesis was blocked by addition of cycloheximide, ornithine decarboxylase mRNA levels remained unchanged in response to glucocorticoids, indicating a primary effect of dexamethasone. Furthermore, cycloheximide by itself had no significant effect on ornithine decarboxylase mRNA levels. Inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D showed a half-life for ornithine decarboxylase mRNA of approximately 240 minutes. Ornithine decarboxylase mRNA stability was not affected by dexamethasone pretreatment for 12 hours. Therefore, these data suggest that dexamethasone regulates ODC gene expression via glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene transcription. Furthermore, translational mechanisms seem to be involved in glucocorticoid-regulated ornithine decarboxylase induction.\r"

In the prairie dog, diets were composed of semipurified components of chow, plus cholesterol (1.2%), with and without aspirin. Animals were studied for either 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Cholesterol gallstones were present in all groups at the end of each period; aspirin did not alter the incidence of cholelithiasis. All animals studied had cholesterol crystals in the bile when they were killed. Liver cholesterol levels in prairie dogs with and without aspirin tended to be lower in animals fed chow than in animals fed semipurified diets. There were no significant differences in cholesterol levels in the plasma or bile. The cholesterol saturation index of all biles approached unity when animals were fed chow with aspirin; animals fed the semipurified diets had cholesterol saturation indices of less than 1.0. The prairie dogs fed aspirin plus cholesterol in the semipurified diet showed increased levels of biliary chenodeoxycholic acid amidates and concomitant decreased levels of cholic acid amidates compared with animals fed the same diet without aspirin. Hamsters fed aspirin plus cholesterol in a semipurified diet tended to have a greater incidence of gallstones than animals given no aspirin (80% vs. 55%). Liver and bile cholesterol levels were similar with and without aspirin; plasma cholesterol levels increased significantly with aspirin [14.20 vs. 7.80 mmol/L (549 vs. 301 mg/dL)]. Lithogenic indices in all hamsters were above unity; biliary lipids, total lipid concentration, and biliary bile acid composition were similar. These results show that the addition of aspirin to a lithogenic diet does not reduce the incidence of cholelithiasis.\r"

Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl- absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl- absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, D-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in short-circuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.\r"

The current study was designed to compare long-term resistance of the colonic and jejunal mucosa to gastric or mixed duodenogastric secretions. The following preparations were performed in Wistar rats: transposition of a colonic or jejunal patch (a) to the gastric body, with or without truncal vagotomy, or (b) to the gastric antrum and proximal duodenum, with or without truncal vagotomy. Jejunal and colonic patches were removed 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery. The only damage to the transposed mucosae was the alteration of microvilli. The alteration was more severe in colonic than in jejunal patches and was prevented by truncal vagotomy. Long-term resistance of the transposed mucosae to the environmental challenge may depend on their adaptation potentiality, involving both specific and nonspecific mechanisms. Nonspecific mechanisms include the increased production of mucus and the gastric-like transformation of the superficial epithelial layer. Specific mechanisms include the reduction of the mucosal surface size for jejunal segments and the shifting in mucin secretion patterns for colonic segments.\r"

In this study, the effects of various PGs on the growth of the human gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III were investigated. All the PGs tested inhibited KATO III cell growth with a relative potency order of PGE2 greater than PGE1 greater than 17S,20-dimethyl-6-oxo PGE1-methyl ester (ornoprostil) greater than PGF2 alpha. This inhibition was accompanied by an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Furthermore, in the presence of guanosine triphosphate, these PGs stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the plasma membrane of KATO III cells, followed by enhancement of membrane guanosine triphosphatase activity. The relative potencies of these PGs for increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, activating adenylate cyclase, and enhancing guanosine triphosphatase activity were all comparable to those for inhibiting cell growth. On the other hand, the proliferation of KATO III cells was also inhibited by forskolin as well as dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas none of the agents that did not increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels had any effect. These results suggest that PGs inhibit KATO III cell growth by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate production via a guanosine triphosphate-dependent process, suggesting the involvement of guanosine triphosphate-binding stimulatory protein, probably coupled to PGE2 receptors, in the action of PGs.\r"

  ".W": "Of 124 patients who underwent endoscopic polypectomy, 70 were colonoscopically reevaluated during a mean period of 10 years. On the basis of the clinical outcome, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1, 31 patients who had a colon still with no adenomas or cancer; group 2, 35 patients in whom one or more metachronous adenomatous polyps developed; and group 3, 4 patients in whom a carcinoma of the colon subsequently developed. In addition to the clinical and pathological features, the pattern of the immunohistologic staining for carcinoembryonic antigen and secretory component was studied. Moreover, the mucin histochemical staining intensity of neutral mucins, sulfomucins, and sialomucins was evaluated. The features of the 40 index adenomas obtained from patients in group 1 were compared with the features of the 51 index adenomas from patients in group 2. Furthermore, these characteristics of the index adenomas were compared with those in the 69 metachronous adenomas of the group 2 patients. It was found that male sex (P less than 0.005) and a history of colorectal neoplasia (P less than 0.02) are main factors for the development of new adenomas. The neutral mucins were less abundant in the group 2 index adenomas (r = -0.21; P less than 0.05). The expression of the other evaluated markers was not significantly different between both groups, although the group 2 index adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.22; P less than 0.05) and showed a trend toward a more pronounced cytoplasmic expression of carcinoembryonic antigen than the index adenomas from group 1 (22% vs. 12.5%). Moreover, it was found that in comparison with the index adenomas, metachronous adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.24; P less than 0.01) and more sessile (r = 0.20; P less than 0.002). Significant negative correlations, i.e., decrease, were also found in the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (surface P less than 0.001; cytoplasmic P less than 0.05) and neutral mucins (P less than 0.005) between the index adenomas and the metachronous adenomas, whereas positive correlations were found for secretory component (P = 0.0001) and sulfomucins (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that a limited production of neutral mucins in the goblet cells of a small index adenoma from a male patient with a history of colorectal neoplasia is indicative of an increased risk for the development of new colorectal adenomas. Furthermore, the clinical, mucin histochemical, and immunohistochemical findings of the metachronous adenomas show less malignancy-associated features than those of the index adenomas.\r"

  ".W": "Functional gastrointestinal disease is believed to be very common, but reports of its prevalence have not usually evaluated random community samples, and validated questionnaires have not been used to elicit symptoms. The prevalence of specific colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome among representative middle-aged whites was determined from a defined population, and the impact of these symptoms on presentation for medical care was measured. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1021 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30-64 years, was obtained. All subjects were mailed a valid self-report questionnaire that identified gastrointestinal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The response rate was 82% (n = 835). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of abdominal pain (more than six times in the prior year) was 26.2 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 23.1-29.2). The prevalence of chronic constipation (hard stools and straining and/or less than 3 stools per week greater than 25% of the time) was 17.4 (95% confidence interval, 14.8-20.0), whereas the prevalence of chronic diarrhea (loose watery stools, and/or greater than 3 stools per day greater than 25% of the time) was 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 15.3-20.5). The prevalence of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation was similar in women and men, except that infrequent defecation and straining at stool were more common in women. Using the Manning symptom criteria to identify irritable bowel syndrome (greater than or equal to 2 of 6 symptoms in those with abdominal pain more than six times in the prior year), the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 17.0 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 14.4-19.6). Overall, 71 persons (9%) reported visiting a physician for abdominal pain or disturbed defecation in the prior year; a subset of variables related to pain severity were the best predictors of health care seeking after adjustment for age and gender. However, these accounted for only 22% of the log likelihood. In conclusion, more than one third of an unselected middle-aged population reported chronic abdominal pain or disturbed defecation, and more than one in six had symptoms compatible with the irritable bowel syndrome. Only a minority had presented for medical evaluation; moreover, the characteristics of the abdominal complaints did not explain the seeking of health care in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "The intragastric action of beer and its known ingredients before and after fermentation on gastric acid secretion and release of gastrin was studied in healthy humans. None of 11 tested ingredients of fermented beer (2 x 500 mL, pH 5.5, given either alone or in combination) or hop extract had any significant effect. Finished beer (6 weeks old) and new beer were potent stimuli of acid output, causing 93% and 76% of the incremental maximal acid output in response to pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg SC), respectively. Before the addition of yeast, preproducts of beer were considerably less potent. Thus, first and finished wort caused only a minor acid response which was 48% and 46% of maximal acid output. Foreign fermentation in first and finished wort is presumably the reason for the stimulatory action because glucose solutions in concentrations (11.5% wt/vol) seen in wort did not stimulate acid secretion. However, glucose solutions to which yeast was added, resulting in fermentation, were as potent stimuli of acid secretion as beer. Lyophilization of beer at pH 11.0 and dialysis (cutoff mol wt, 1000) removed the stimulatory substances. The plasma gastrin responses paralleled the gastric acid response to the different stimulants. It was concluded that (a) the addition of yeast to finished wort and the following alcoholic fermentation are the essential steps for the stimulatory action of beer on gastric acid secretion and release of gastrin; (b) carbohydrate metabolites with a molecular weight of less than 1000 are the acid-stimulatory agents in fermented beer; and (c) gastrin is the mediator of the stimulation of acid secretion because all substances that had a potent acid-stimulatory action also were potent stimuli of gastrin release.\r"

Ten healthy, nonsmoking young men participated in this placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Each subject was given omeprazole, 20 mg, every morning for 1 week and placebo every morning for 1 week in random order and separated by a 2-3 week washout period. On the sixth and seventh days of each period urine was collected twice daily, and urinary metabolites of caffeine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The urinary metabolite ratio of three paraxanthine 7-demethylation products relative to a paraxanthine-hydroxylation product corresponds to caffeine clearance and, therefore, to P450IA2 activity. This calculated ratio was 4.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.9-5.6) in the placebo and 4.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-5.5) in the omeprazole period. These results show that the metabolism of caffeine was unaltered following omeprazole treatment, indicating that omeprazole treatment has no influence on cytochrome P450IA2 activity in the clinical situation.\r"

The effect of continuous dosing with ranitidine, 150 mg nightly, was compared with intermittent dosing (27 days of placebo each month) with active ranitidine, 150 mg nightly, only on the night of each experiment. Simultaneous 24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin concentration were measured monthly for 5 months in 17 healthy subjects (7 continuous and 10 intermittent dosing). In the intermittent-dosing group, the antisecretory response to ranitidine, 150 mg nightly, was preserved throughout the 141-day trial period; the median nocturnal integrated acidity decreased from 557 mmol.h/L (day 0) to 38 mmol.h/L on day 1 of dosing, and it ranged between 32 and 55 (median, 45) mmol.h/L during days 29-141. In the continuous-dosing group, there was a significant return of nocturnal intragastric acidity on days 29 and 85 compared with day 1 of dosing. The median nocturnal integrated acidity decreased in the continuous-dosing group from 554 mmol.h/L (day 0) to 87 mmol.h/L on the first day of dosing, and it ranged between 145 and 287 (median, 170) mmol.h/L during days 29-141. Either intermittent or continuous dosing with ranitidine was associated with an elevation of plasma gastrin concentration, which remained constant throughout the 5-month study. Tolerance does develop in healthy subjects during the first month of dosing with ranitidine, 150 mg nightly, but it is not a progressive phenomenon, and it is probably not of clinical relevance.\r"

  ".W": "The role of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons in acid-induced HCO3- secretion was investigated in the duodenum of anesthetized rats. The proximal duodenum was perfused with saline (pH 4.5), the pH of perfusate and the transmucosal potential differences were continuously monitored, and HCO3- output was determined by pH change. Under these conditions, duodenal pH, potential difference, and HCO3- output were significantly increased in response to IV injection of prostaglandin E2 (300 micrograms/kg) and luminal acidification (10 mmol/L HCl, 10 minutes). These responses induced by luminal acid were significantly attenuated by SC pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg), preexposure of the mucosa to lidocaine (4%, 15 minutes), functional ablation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons, or even prior application of capsaicin (6 mg/mL, 30 minutes) to the duodenum. Although capsaicin application by itself (0.3-6 mg/mL) produced a concentration-dependent increase of HCO3- output, this effect was significantly reduced by lidocaine, indomethacin, or chemical deafferentation and exhibited a tachyphylaxis after repeated application at a high concentration (6 mg/mL). Neither of these treatments significantly affected the HCO3- response induced by prostaglandin E2. It was concluded that stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons increased duodenal HCO3- secretion and that these neurons may be involved in the mechanism of HCO3- response induced by luminal acid in the duodenum.\r"

  ".U": "91365203\r", 
  ".W": "The sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm has been difficult to measure in humans. The authors recently reported the use of a Dent sleeve device to measure esophagogastric junction pressure during contraction of the crural diaphragm. However, the major limitation of the conventional sleeve device is its slow response rate, and sustained diaphragmatic contractions of 6-8 seconds must be induced to measure the true pressure. In this article, the principles of a reverse-perfused sleeve device and the theoretical basis for its fast response rate are reported. The reverse-perfused sleeve is validated in an in vitro model of the lower esophageal sphincter. Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed in seven healthy human subjects. Standardized Muller maneuvers and straight-leg raises were performed to induce diaphragmatic contractions. Pressure increases of 50-150 mm Hg during diaphragmatic contractions were attained in less than 1 second. The delay between the actual contraction of the diaphragm as measured by simultaneously recorded crural diaphragm electromyography and pressure recorded by the sleeve was only 0.25-0.50 seconds. Increasing the rate of infusion of the sleeve from 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min did not further improve the response rate of the reverse perfused sleeve. It was concluded that the reverse-perfused sleeve is a considerable improvement over the conventional sleeve for quantitating the sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm. The role of the crural diaphragm in reflux esophagitis may be easily investigated using a reverse-perfused sleeve device.\r"

Tetrodotoxin-sensitive inhibitory junction potentials had a mean (+/- SEM) amplitude of 21 +/- 3.3 mV in human jejunum and 24.1 +/- 1.3 mV in baboon jejunum. In both species, exogenously added methionine enkephalin and dynorphin (1-13) decreased inhibitory junction potentials amplitude in a dose-dependent manner with methionine enkephalin being more potent. Both opioid peptides acted on receptors located on axons of intrinsic inhibitory nerves. The effects of both methionine enkephalin and dynorphin(1-13) were blocked by ICI-174,864, a selective delta-receptor antagonist. The selective delta agonist, cyclic [D-penicillamine2, D-penicillamine5]enkephalin, and the selective mu agonist, Try-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2, (each 10 mumol/L) decreased inhibitory junction potential amplitude by 79% +/- 6.9% and 61% +/- 4.8%, respectively. The selective kappa agonist, [trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-91-pyrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]- benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate, (10 mumol/L) had no effect. Although direct postsynaptic opioid receptor blockade of the inhibitory neurotransmitter on the smooth muscle cell has not been ruled out, the authors believe these data suggest that delta and mu receptors were present on inhibitory motor nerves innervating the circular muscle and that methionine enkephalin and dynorphin(1-13) decreased release of inhibitory neurotransmitter(s) by acting on delta receptors.\r"

Age-related differences in acid secretion were especially prominent in men, and age-related differences in serum pepsinogen I and II concentrations were more prominent in women. Higher gastric acid secretion rates in older subjects could not be explained by body size (height, weight, body surface area, or fat-free body mass) or by the higher incidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori. Using a multivariate linear regression model, age had an independent positive effect on acid secretion, and H. pylori infection had an independent negative effect. It was concluded that aging is associated with an increase in gastric acid secretion in humans, especially in men, while infection with H. pylori is associated with lower acid secretion rates.\r"

There was a significant positive correlation of values between the two methods (P less than 0.0001). In patients with an EGR-Im greater than 20% or EGR-It greater than 57% and postgastric surgery symptoms some of the symptoms were attributed to EGR, an antireflux procedure is expected to relieve those symptoms. Sixteen of these patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastrectomy and their preoperative symptoms were relieved.\r"

To test the key mechanisms potentially involved in symptomatic gastric accommodation, the sensorial responses (on a 0-10 perception score) and the gastric tone responses (by electronic barostat) to either gastric accommodation (n = 10) or to cold stress (n = 10) were measured in 20 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls. The mechanical accommodation of the stomach to gastric distention (compliance) was similar in patients (52 +/- 8 mL/mm Hg) and controls (57 +/- 6 mL/mm Hg). However, isobaric gastric distention elicited more upper abdominal discomfort in dyspeptics than in controls (perception scores, 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5, respectively; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.005). Cold stress induced a similar gastric relaxatory response in dyspeptics and controls (delta vol, 145 mL +/- 40 mL vs. 141 mL +/- 42 mL, respectively); hand perception (scores, 8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and autonomic responses were also similar. It is concluded that an abnormal afferent sensorial pathway (altered gastric perception) may be a major mechanism of symptom production in functional dyspepsia.\r"

All antipsychotics theoretically work through the same mechanism, so drug selection is based primarily on side effect profiles. In this article, we provide prescribing guidelines for antipsychotics and other psychoactive drugs used in the treatment of elderly patients with emotional dysfunction. Included are stimulants, lithium, carbamazepine, propranolol HCl, and buspirone HCl. Guidelines for benzodiazepines and antidepressants were discussed in part 1 of this two-part article (page 40).\r"
