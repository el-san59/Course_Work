Patients could request additional i.m. analgesic for pain. The study groups were well matched. The trial was stopped after 55 patients had been studied (nalbuphine 29, buprenorphine 26), because nine patients in the nalbuphine group had inadequate pain relief (P less than 0.01) shortly after surgery (mean 2.5 h). Analysis of the results on an \"intention to treat\" basis showed that the patients who received buprenorphine had significantly greater pain relief at 1, 3, 6 and 20 h after surgery. Patients who received buprenorphine were assessed by the physiotherapist to have less pain and better chest expansion. More additional analgesic was given to the patients receiving nalbuphine. In the patients receiving buprenorphine, the mean ventilatory rate was less (N = 19 b.p.m., B = 14 b.p.m.) (P less than 0.001) and the increase in PaCO2 was greater (N = 0.5 kPa, B = 1.1 kPa) (P less than 0.001), compared with the value before operation. Side effects were equal, and no serious adverse effects were observed in either group.\r"

Samples were obtained from toe nails, toe webs, and the upper back; clinically suspicious lesions from other areas were also examined. A total of 576 sites were sampled (288 in each group). Pathogenic fungi were identified from 44 sites (15%) in the renal transplant (RT) group compared with 26 sites (9%) in the control group, (P less than 0.05). However, site-specific differences were less marked; no difference was found between the RT group and controls when the results from the toe nails and toe webs were analysed separately. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the most common species isolated from both groups. Colonization of the back with Pityrosporum yeasts was significantly more common in the RT group, but few patients in either group had tinea versicolor. 'Mixed infections', with more than one species of fungus isolated in an individual, were only found in the RT group. We also examined the relationship between the presence of fungal infection and the presence or absence of cutaneous malignancy in the renal transplant group. No increase in the prevalence of fungal colonization was found in those patients who had developed cutaneous malignancy compared with those who had not.\r"

Blood flow in the fetal aorta and umbilical vein was measured with imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Volume blood flow values and variables describing the waveform of the maximum aortic blood velocity were checked for relations to subsequent fetal outcome. A new semi-quantitative velocity waveform variable, blood flow class (BFC), was designed and tested. The occurrence of IUGR, imminent fetal distress, a low Apgar score at 1 and 5 min, and a low pH in the umbilical artery and vein were adopted to characterize fetal outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to demonstrate the sensitivity and false positive rate, and the Cohen's Kappa index was used to compare the predictive capacity of the various blood flow variables. BFC, describing the blood velocity waveform with emphasis on its end-diastolic part, was found to be the most powerful marker of imminent fetal asphyxia (Kappa = 0.66) and of intrauterine growth retardation (Kappa = 0.48).\r"

Retrospective analysis of hCG levels indicated that 419 (88.6%) women had been pregnant at the time of treatment. With few exceptions, administration of the PGE2 analogue induced vaginal bleeding in both pregnant and non-pregnant women but the duration and subjectively perceived amount of bleeding were greater than after vacuum aspiration. Both treatments were equally effective. In pregnant women the overall frequency of complete abortion was 91% for prostaglandin treatment and 94% for vacuum aspirations. If non-pregnant women were included, the respective success rates (i.e. percentages of women not pregnant 2 weeks after treatment) were 92% and 95%. Gastrointestinal side-effects and lower abdominal pain requiring intramuscular analgesia were more common after prostaglandin therapy than following vacuum aspiration in both pregnant and non-pregnant women.\r"

Conjunctival scrapings showed the presence of mast cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and very few basophils in all the specimens. Eosinophils were present in only four scrapings. The superficial epithelium of the limbic lesion and the adjacent cornea and conjunctiva was studied by the replica technique. The limbic lesion area showed the presence of necrotic epithelial cells mixed with inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leucocytes and very few basophils. Most of the inflammatory cells were HLA-DR+. Many OKT6+ cells were present, indicating the presence of Langerhans cells. T-lymphocytes including a few helper/inducer cells and many suppressor/cytotoxic cells, were detected in the infiltrate. In addition many B-lymphocytes were observed. These findings suggest that other immune mechanisms in addition to type 1 reaction are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

Clinical improvement of the treated knee joint was measured by the following variables: pain, tenderness, morning stiffness, swelling, range of movement and walking ability. Placebo response was considerable. However, clinical improvement with rimexolone at 20 mg and 40 mg was significantly superior to placebo for most of the variables, whilst with the 10 mg dose only reduction of tenderness was significantly superior. The duration of improvement was longest with 40 mg of rimexolone. One single, intra-articular injection of this dose into the affected knee joint provided significant reduction in pain, tenderness and stiffness and improved the range of movement and walking ability for a period of 8 to 12 weeks.\r"

Studies of diagnostic accuracy are analogous to Phase II, whereas studies evaluating the contribution to clinical management correspond to the Phase III category. Currently the majority of published studies employ the Phase II design. More emphasis on Phase III studies is required.\r"

The densitometric method, which was more accurate than the geometric method, had a mean systematic error of up to 4% and a mean intra-observer variability of about 15% (coefficient of variation).

Thirty-eight (72%) of these investigations were performed as a routine pre-operative procedure to identify occult spinal dysraphism in patients with childhood scoliosis; the remainder were because of the \"orthopaedic syndrome\", cervical radiculopathy, back pain and patients with clinical findings to suggest spinal dysraphism. In the 20 patients (38%) with idiopathic scoliosis, there was no case of spinal dysraphism and CT myelography provided no additional information to the myelogram. In the seven patients with spinal dysraphism the plain radiographic abnormalities identified were lumbar vertebral abnormalities (five), thoracic vertebral abnormalities (one), and sacral agenesis (one). Diastematomyelia was found in four patients, a low tethered cord and lipoma in two patients and a large lipoma in one patient. In all of these cases the myelogram indicated the intraspinal abnormalities; however, CT myelography provided more precise anatomical detail. We conclude that CT myelography is not indicated in the initial preoperative assessment of idiopathic scoliosis but should be reserved for patients with congenital or complicated scoliosis where the association with dysraphism is well recognised.\r"

The accuracies of a positive interpretation of HCC on ultrasound and scintigraphy in the absence of cirrhosis were 85% and 66% respectively (NS), but fell (significantly in the case of scintigraphy: p less than 0.05) to 80% and 31% respectively in the presence of cirrhosis (p less than 0.01). The poorer performance of scintigraphy in the presence of cirrhosis was a result both of its lower sensitivity (50% compared with 85%) and the greater frequency of false positives (28% vs 5%: p less than 0.001). The accuracy of a negative interpretation of HCC on scintigraphy in the absence of cirrhosis was 96% but fell to 84% in the presence of cirrhosis, whereas on ultrasound it remained the same (96%). In conclusion, we recommend ultrasound in preference to scintigraphy as a more accurate technique for the diagnosis of HCC in the presence of cirrhosis.\r"

Two patients (13%) were discovered incidentally between 1976 and 1980 compared with 13 (35%) between 1981 and 1985. The renal tumours were discovered incidentally at the time of intravenous urography (IVU), ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and angiography. There were 13 stage I and two stage II lesions, as assessed pathologically after nephrectomy. The tumours were less than 6 cm in diameter. Thirteen of 15 patients are alive between 6 and 90 months after surgery. No patient died of renal carcinoma. Our data have shown an increase in the proportion of incidentally diagnosed cases. The routine use of intravenous urography, ultrasound and computed tomography has led to earlier diagnosis, lower stage and possibly longer survival in patients with incidentally detected renal carcinomas compared with patients where the diagnosis was suspected.\r"

Three patients with malakoplakia of the bladder are reported: two had recurrent Esch. coli urinary tract infections and one had widespread urological malignancy. The pathogenesis is discussed and a simple treatment regime, which was rapidly successful in the patient who received it, is recommended.\r"

On analysis of the risk of relapse after initial chemotherapy, the independent adverse influence was detected of serum AFP greater than 500 micrograms/l and of bulky disease defined by clinical staging. An adverse influence of high serum HCG levels was not seen, probably due to the small number of patients in this series with this presenting feature.\r"

Sixty-three of these children who had the examinations carried out within a 6-month period were assessed in detail.

Glucose disposal was significantly decreased in the cancer group at all insulin infusion rates, whilst attained insulin levels and metabolic clearance rates of insulin were comparable in the control and cancer groups. Analysis of dose-response data allowed assessment of sensitivity (insulin concentration of half maximal glucose disposal) and responsiveness (maximal glucose disposal). Responsiveness was significantly reduced in the cancer group (40.3 versus 71.5 mumol kg-1 min-1; P less than 0.001), whilst sensitivity was similar (93.7 milliunits l-1 in controls versus 90.8 milliunits l-1 in cancer patients), suggesting a postreceptor defect in insulin action in the cancer group.\r"

Initially only 66 per cent of patients with viable strangulation and 46 per cent of those with non-viable strangulation had been treated by immediate surgery after resuscitation. The remainder had been treated conservatively for a median of 3.8 and 2.2 days respectively before undergoing surgery. The computer predicted on the basis of presenting symptoms and signs that 82 per cent of patients with viable strangulation and 97 per cent of those with non-viable strangulation had or would develop strangulation and should have undergone immediate surgery.

Goals of therapy include: 1) avoidance of repeated episodes of asthma, 2) avoidance of emergency room visits, 3) avoidance of status asthmaticus, 4) prevention of death in the mother, 5) use of minimal medications in the gravida, and 6) avoidance of maternal medication use with uncertain or deleterious effects on the fetus. Because acute severe asthma may have it onset during pregnancy, the physician must be prepared to diagnose and treat the gravida to avoid or reduce episodes of maternal hypoxemia, hypocarbia or hypercarbia. Status asthmaticus has been associated with maternal and fetal deaths as well as intrauterine growth retardation. Although it is logical to assume that prevention of repeated episodes of asthma would be associated with a more favorable outcome in pregnancy, only recently was this actually documented. The purpose of this manuscript is to review issues in diagnosis and management of asthma during pregnancy and lactation.\r"

Many of these women who seem to have \"developed\" rhinitis during pregnancy turn out, on careful questioning, to have had similar preexisting symptoms. Furthermore, these women and those who truly appear to have developed their symptoms for the first time during pregnancy are often found to have common causes for their rhinitis. Certain factors have been cited to account for the frequent appearance (or reappearance) of rhinitis during pregnancy (Table 1). Nasal vascular pooling from the increased circulating blood volume and possibly from progesterone induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation will enhance nasal stuffiness. Stress associated with even a normal pregnancy may have a similar effect. Hormonally induced increased nasal mucous gland activity also has been suggested. The peak age of onset of classical inhalant allergic disease falls within the child bearing time of life, and hence could be coincidental with a pregnancy. Even routine episodes of bacterial rhinosinusitis are increased up to 6-fold during pregnancy. This report will review the clinical approach to rhinitis in the pregnant patient with reference to pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment during this complex time in a woman's life.\r"

The effect of the various external factors to be discussed should always be considered in relation to the genetic constitution of the individual. Several recent studies have shown that the impact of environmental risk factors is quite different in individuals with and without the genetically determined propensity to become sensitized (Fig. 1).\r"

  ".W": "The prevention of atopic disease, though admirable, remains a difficult endeavor. One must overcome inherent and natural forces constantly working to sensitize humans to produce IgE antibodies. These multiple risk factors for developing allergies (Table 1) act in concert to oppose preventive efforts. IgE mediated disorders potentially could be prevented by selectively interfering with the major genetic, cellular, and environmental factors that determine the ultimate phenotypic expression of atopy. Present efforts to prevent allergic disease remain relegated to manipulating the environment by reducing the allergenic load. Unfortunately, however, there has yet to exist a definitive, prospective study that conclusively documents and defines optimal or proven effective dietary and environmental regimens that prevent allergic disease. Until such studies emerge, physicians interested in prevention should be cognizant of the data derived from the limited published reports of dietary and environmental prevention efforts in order to appreciate current espoused recommendations. In addition to developing effective and proven prevention regimens, other issues deserving scrutiny include the following: 1) recognition of those groups (individuals) most at risk, amenable, and/or responsive to preventive efforts; 2) determination of the cost-effectiveness of such endeavors; and 3) identification of interfering variables, ie, noncompliance to recommendations.\r"

  ".W": "Improper techniques are often the cause of overuse syndromes. Unless the technique is corrected, the patient is doomed to recurrence. The same is true of improper posture, especially in the lower extremity and trunk areas. The pitcher or tennis player should have his or her style analyzed for proper form. The runner should have his or her muscular imbalances corrected by exercise and orthotic appliances. As with all other modalities used for treating painful conditions, proper evaluation of the etiology and the rectification of the cause is important. When athletes are underway in their sports seasons, it is often difficult to convince them to accept the ideal healing conditions needed to eliminate the problem. Management of the condition with any modality while maintaining an active lifestyle often brings about ethical scrutiny. However, it is the belief of the authors that noninvasive modalities do not provide the pain relief that would enable the athlete to tolerate activity beyond a significant injurious stress level. The modalities allow the athlete to regain the criteria for return, strength, and range of motion more successfully. Short-term goal setting is imperative to proper return. Several plateaus should be successfully completed before full return to activity is allowed. Tennis elbow, for example, may be allowed an initial period of 5 minutes on alternate days, gradually increasing to full activity every other day. Patients are often so anxious to return to activity that they overdo, leading to a decrease in function with a rapid return to the results of inflammation. The goals of successful rehabilitation of the overuse syndrome are pain-free range of motion, strength, and endurance. The use of cold, heat, electrotherapy, and exercise allow the athlete to reach his or her goal of returning to activity more quickly with a reduced risk of reinjury.\r"

Three patients showed mesangial proliferation, thinning of glomerular basement membranes (GBM) and no deposits by IFM or TEM. They probably represent variants of the Finnish type of CNS. One patient had diffuse sclerosis of the mesangium, irregular and thickened GBMs and electron dense deposits, consistent with the diagnosis of diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). The fifth case also showed changes suggestive of DMS, but was clinically atypical, with an early onset and rapid course.

We measured plasma renin activity, aldosterone and vasopressin (RIAs) at the first, second and third week and again 9 to 12 months after transplantation. Plasma renin activity was in the low-normal range throughout (0.31 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.03, 0.32 +/- 0.05 ng/ml/h on short- vs. 0.32 +/- 0.04 ng/ml/h on long-term), aldosterone showed a tendency to decrease (114 +/- 27, 72 +/- 18, 71 +/- 11 pg/ml on short- vs. 54 +/- 23 pg/ml on long-term), whereas vasopressin remained moderately increased during the observation period (10.5 +/- 0.8, 10.4 +/- 1.6, 8.9 +/- 0.6 pg/ml on short- vs. 9.6 +/- 1.0 pg/ml on long-term). We then investigated the reactivity of the renin-system in 5 of the patients by stimulating renin release by captopril. Increases in plasma renin activity were only moderate (0.35 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.21 ng/ml/h) and blood pressure dropped only slightly (148 +/- 2.0/98 +/- 1.2 vs. 141 +/- 4.6/95 +/- 4.2 mmHg). Levels of plasma aldosterone were significantly suppressed from a low baseline (46.4 +/- 13.5 vs. 25.3 +/- 6.1 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). The increase in vasopressin was unaffected by captopril (9.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.8 +/- 0.4 pg/ml). Our results suggest that in renal transplantation patients with good graft function, the activity of the renin system is unaffected by cyclosporine treatment on short- and on long-term. Vasopressin stimulation does not seem to depend on the renin system and might play a role as a vasoconstrictor in the face of a denervated kidney.\r"

Nicardipine was introduced 3 to 36 weeks post transplantation in 7 cases of hypertension and 1 case of angina pectoris. CsA plasma levels raised considerably 1 to 30 days after nicardipine introduction and returned to pretreatment levels 1 to 7 days after withdrawal. Serum creatinine increased in 1/8 patients. These data suggest that nicardipine interferes with CsA metabolism and this interaction is reversible after nicardipine discontinuation. These findings point out the fact that at least some calcium channel blockers need to be cautiously used in patients receiving CsA.\r"

In the two patients, no diseases resulting in secondary amyloidosis were observed. The unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method (PAP method) served to reveal the deposits of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) in the TCL and other organs comparable to the Congo red positive area. And the Congo red staining for the amyloid protein after potassium permanganate treatment was preserved. According to these results, the carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in long-term hemodialysis was considered as a symptom of systemic amyloidosis.

Specific muscle actions of the limbs and trunk respond to different brain stimuli. Sporadic head, trunk, and limb motions that are spastic in quality eventually give way to more combined, sustained, and regular motions as integration develops. This progressive complexity in stimulus reaction has been evaluated with continuous observation using real-time ultrasound imaging. Monitoring gross fetal body motion has gained acceptance as being useful in predicting impending fetal compromise and even death, especially in the presence of chronic placental insufficiency. Prolonged or frequent body movements noted by maternal perception, electromechanical monitoring, and ultrasound imaging are reassuring findings. Fetal inactivity should be documented and requires a reassessment of any underlying antepartum complication and a more precise evaluation of fetal well-being with the use of other techniques. An adequate interpretation and an explanation of these findings to the pregnant woman is necessary to prevent undue stress from misinformation.\r"

The high false-positive rate for protocols not extended for long periods have required back-up testing with other biophysical means whenever there is nonreactivity. Continued research is required to define \"normal\" reactivity. Meanwhile, ongoing investigations in the area of fetal stimulation may be helpful in arousing the non-reactive sleeping fetus. The benefit of the NST is in its simplicity. Busy practitioners can use it in the office, and large testing centers can screen greater numbers of patients in an effective manner. Given a reactive test, a high expectation of normal outcome is warranted. The false-negative rate, however, for diabetes, postdates, and IUGR, warrant twice-weekly testing. Attention to other baseline characteristics, such as bradycardia and minivariables, coupled with sequential NST evaluation should improve NPV by potentially diagnosing compromise earlier.\r"

Antepartum detection, classification, determination of severity, and ultimately, treatment of the fetus at risk for death and damage in utero form the basis of modern perinatal medicine. It remains to be determined whether addition of further variables or refinement of existing variables will improve accuracy still further. The assessment of multiple biophysical variables and responses to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli is helpful in differentiating a normal sleeping fetus from an asphyxiated one.\r"

Although dating the pregnancy might be the reason for the initial evaluation, it is important to examine the fetus for structural malformations as well. Both can be accomplished with a second-trimester scan. Once the pregnancy is accurately dated, subsequent measurements of the head, abdomen, and femur should be plotted on growth curves in relation to the age of the fetus, based on the earlier ultrasound examination. The patient should not be related with subsequent examinations. If asymmetric growth failure occurs, then intervention or maternal bed rest should be considered. Intervention should be considered in the presence of abnormal antepartum testing and when fetal growth has arrested following the institution of maternal bed rest. If symmetric IUGR is present, careful evaluation of the fetus for structural malformations and an abnormal karyotype should be considered.\r"

This applies to both the intrapartum and antenatal period. The presence of normal data (e.g., reassuring fetal heart rate tracing) allows the woman to continue confidently with the pregnancy or labor course. When the information is nonreassuring, the cause of the abnormal data should be identified and corrected. Position change and discontinuation of pitocin are examples of common intrapartum actions. In the antepartum period, a compromised maternal condition is often associated with abnormalities in fetal heart rate testing. Rather than respond with immediate delivery for a potentially compromised fetus, the physician should treat and correct the maternal condition. As demonstrated by these case reports, this often allows for the continuation of pregnancy or labor with improvement of maternal and fetal status as well as avoidance of unnecessary and perhaps dangerous risk of untimely and premature intervention.\r"

The present study examined this question by evaluating the effects of intravenous placebo or dexamethasone (0.1, 0.32, or 1.0 mg) on suppression of immunoreactive beta-endorphin secretion and development of postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars in 48 patients. Compared with placebo, all doses of dexamethasone suppressed the postoperative increase in circulating levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin. Patients administered 0.1 mg dexamethasone reported greater levels of pain, compared with those given placebo, from 60 through 120 minutes after surgery. Postoperative pain for the 0.32 and 1.0 mg doses did not differ from that for the placebo group. The increased pain after suppression of beta-endorphin release by the low dose of dexamethasone suggests that pituitary secretion of immunoreactive beta-endorphin alleviates postoperative pain under these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Renal function and excretion of water, salt, and the prostacyclin hydration product (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) were evaluated in 10 furosemide-treated patients with well-controlled congestive heart failure. Four doses of sulindac (200 mg b.i.d.) and naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.) were given every 12 hours in a double-blind crossover design. Naproxen significantly decreased the urinary excretion of water (19%), sodium (26%), chloride (26%), and 6-keto PGF1 alpha (76%) and decreased osmolal clearance (18%). No significant changes in these functions were observed in the patients receiving sulindac. Plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, freewater clearance, or clearance of furosemide did not change significantly with either treatment. Although the basal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were reduced, these patients with cardiac disease, with normal serum sodium concentration, did not have any further reduction of GFR or RPF despite naproxen-induced inhibition of renal prostacyclin synthesis. It is concluded that renal prostaglandins contribute to the natriuretic effect of oral furosemide in patients with compensated congestive heart failure. In this clinical setting, GFR and RPF are not critically dependent on intact renal PGI2 synthesis. The lack of effect on renal prostaglandin synthesis and the renal response to oral furosemide supports the concept of a renal sparing effect of sulindac.\r"

Cardiac output rose progressively at higher temperatures, increasing by 30% at 33 degrees C and by 121% at 39 degrees C. At thermoneutral temperatures (33 degrees C and 35 degrees C) this was achieved by an increase in stroke volume of 50% despite a significant decrease in heart rate. There was a further rise in stroke volume and pulse rate at higher temperatures and a mean tachycardia of 109 +/- 4 beats/min was noted at 39 degrees C. Calculated peripheral resistance reduced progressively with increasing temperature of immersion. 3. This non-invasive and simple technique may provide a non-exercise-related cardiovascular stress test to study cardiovascular responses in a variety of pathophysiological states.\r"

Virus culture is the most sensitive technique for diagnosis of most infections due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but is insensitive for the diagnosis of varicella-zoster (VZV) infection and not routinely available for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Identification of viral antigens on infected cells with monoclonal antibodies is useful for definitive identification of virus in cell culture and for rapid diagnosis of infection due to HSV, VZV, or CMV. Serologic studies are useful for the diagnosis of EBV infection, because clinical symptoms and an antibody response occur simultaneously, and other diagnostic tests are generally unavailable. Although serologic studies may be used retrospectively to diagnose infections due to HSV, VZV, or CMV, these results are seldom available in time to be useful in managing the acute infection or in guiding antiviral chemotherapy. Newer diagnostic techniques, such as detection of viral nucleic acids using radiolabeled probes, may become useful in the future for the rapid diagnosis of EBV or CMV infection.\r"

The disease occurred most often in late adult life, with a male predominance. Symptoms were abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and a lower abdominal mass in most patients. Barium enema disclosed narrowing, shortening, and poor extensibility of the colon, and ultrasonography and computed tomography showed thickening of the mesocolon and colonic wall with soft-tissue density. Exploratory laparotomy was done in all patients, and colectomy, colostomy, or other surgical treatments were performed in 17 (85 percent). Gross appearance at the time of surgery was characterized by a marked thickening or a firm mass of the mesocolon with a puckered surface involving the appendices epiploicae of the colon. Microscopically, degeneration of the adipose tissue, revealed by aggregates of lipid-laden macrophages, was diagnostic. Inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis also were present in many patients. Mesenteric panniculitis of the colon seems to be a lesion more advanced than the same condition of the small intestine, and colostomy or bypass surgery may be needed for alleviation of severe symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the new concepts of the anatomy of the anal sphincter mechanism and the physiology of defecation is presented. The external sphincter is a triple-loop system; each loop can function as a separate sphincter through voluntary inhibition action and mechanical compression. Stress defecation resulting from internal sphincter damage is described. A new technique for repair of rectal incontinence is presented, which depends on inducing continence not only by mechanical compression, but also by voluntary inhibition. The mechanism of defecation and rectal continence is described and four types of incontinence presented. Also, the mechanism of both the levator dysfunction syndrome and prolapse is demonstrated and a technique of repair is presented. The study defines two types of rectal anomalies; suprahiatal and infrahiatal. The role of the embryonic anorectal sinus, anorectal band, and epithelial debris in the genesis of perirectal suppuration, chronic anal fissure, pruritus ani, and hemorrhoids is described. The communicating veins, identified between the hemorrhoidal and vesical plexuses, offer an explanation for the vague pathologic aspects of recurrent bacteriuria, urethral discharge, cervicitis, and vaginitis, and provide a proper line for their treatment. They also serve to perform a new radiographic technique--anal cystography--and to administer drugs, including chemotherapeutics, in the treatment of pelvic malignancies.\r"

The study included four periods: two for washout and two for lactitol and lactose administration. During washout periods, which lasted two weeks each, patients were stabilized with neomycin plus milk of magnesia. Lactitol and lactose were administered during four weeks each. Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive lactose (group A) and eight patients to receive lactitol (group B) first. PSE parameters, ie, mental state, number connection test performance, asterixis and blood ammonia levels were assessed fortnightly. Electroencephalographic tracings and stool pHs were evaluated at the end of each study period. After the first administration of lactose and lactitol, no statistically significant differences in PSE parameters were found. At the same stage, a significant stool acidification (P less than 0.05) was detected. It is concluded that lactitol seems to be safe and efficacious in treating patients with chronic PSE.\r"

Tests to exclude infections agents are very important, since the clinical and radiological appearance of these may mimic IBD, and patients with IBD may suffer from superinfection. There are no laboratory tests which can differentiate Crohn's colitis from ulcerative colitis (UC). The tests used in the assessment and management of severely ill patients (Hgb, WBC, electrolytes, etc) are important, since abnormalities need to be corrected on an ongoing basis. The tests used to assess nutritional status are of little clinical value, since \"clinical assessment\" is as good as the laboratory assessment. Estimation of disease activity by tests is rarely better than the judgment of the clinician. Workup for malabsorption in Crohn's disease and the assessment of absorptive capacity of the terminal ileum are important for proper planning of management. Laboratory tests are also useful in clarifying the nature of some complications (eg, anemias and joint diseases).\r"

A universally accepted and acceptable clinical instrument to measure the disease activity of either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis will probably never be achieved. However, if interested clinicians can agree on a basic set of observations and how to make and record them, accurate comparisons of therapeutic outcomes across time and space will become possible.

  ".W": "There is accumulating clinical evidence that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a primary metabolite of sulfasalazine (SAS), represents the therapeutic active moiety of the azo-compound SAS in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since it is presumed that 5-ASA acts from the lumen of the intestine, it is important to know how much 5-ASA is released from its special galenic formulations. After liberation of 5-ASA in the terminal ileum (only slow release oral preparations of 5-ASA) and colon (5-ASA suppositories and enemas), 5-ASA is only partly absorbed. A major part of this 5-ASA is presystemically eliminated, eg, N-acetylated during its first passage through the intestinal mucosa and liver. Mean steady state plasma levels of unchanged 5-ASA are rather low (range 0.02 to 1.2 microgram/ml) whereas those of Ac-5-ASA are always higher (range 0.1 to 2.9 micrograms/ml). This is due to the rapid elimination of 5-ASA (t1/2 = 0.4 to 2.4h) and the slightly slower renal excretion of the Ac-5-ASA (t1/2 = 6 to 9 h, renal clearance = 200 to 300 ml/min). The knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of 5-ASA from different drug formulations might contribute to a better understanding of its mode of action in IBD.\r"

Asacol and SAS are equally effective in maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis. Dipentum was more efficient than placebo. There was only a low incidence of side effects from oral 5-ASA preparations, but larger-scale trials may be needed for a more accurate profile of adverse reactions.\r"

Each trial period started with a titration, followed by a 12-week steady state. Concomitant medications were kept constant during the trial. The criteria for assessment were seizure fit frequency and severity; tolerability; hematology and blood chemistry; plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs; EEG; cardiovascular parameters; and treatment preference. The following differences regarding OCBZ were detected: 9% reduction of the total number of seizures, with a significant reduction of tonic-clonic (20%) and tonic (31%) seizures; increased alertness and concentration ability in five patients; an allergic skin reaction with CBZ that completely disappeared in two patients while receiving OCBZ; an increase of valproate and phenytoin plasma levels in a number of patients, probably caused by reduced enzyme induction; a slight but significant reduction of serum Na, not causing clinical symptoms; less seizures than in the CBZ period in 25 patients (52%); and a preference for OCBZ in 23 patients (48%). We consider OCBZ at least as effective as CBZ with a slightly better tolerability. In severe cases, the wider therapeutic window might improve seizure control.\r"

Possible influential factors include patient age; duration, frequency, etiology, and type of seizures; hereditary factors; psychosocial issues; and antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Whereas many of these factors are beyond the physician's control, AED therapy is one element that can be addressed in treatment decisions by recognizing the potential cognitive effects of particular AEDs. For example, phenobarbital impairs memory and concentration; phenytoin affects attention, problem solving ability, and performance of visuomotor tasks. In contrast, carbamazepine may affect concentration, while valproate would appear to have minimal effects on cognition. Moreover, cognitive effects of AEDs are amplified with coadministration of multiple anticonvulsants (polytherapy). A review of studies on the cognitive effects of monotherapy with AEDs, as opposed to those of polytherapy, provides evidence that drug-related cognitive dysfunction can be reversed if patients are switched to a simpler therapeutic regimen. Future research should be directed toward developing reliable measures for assessing and monitoring cognition, and understanding the particular cognitive side effects of each AED. Physicians also need to revise their opinions about which side effects are \"tolerable\" for epileptic patients.\r"

These women are at increased risk of seizures during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics of anticonvulsant drugs, the levels of which decline as pregnancy advances. Not all drugs are altered in a similar manner, however. The rate of congenital malformations in infants of epileptic mothers is 2.4 times higher than in the general population. Malformations occur with all of the commonly used anticonvulsant drugs. The possible mechanisms of teratogenicity include folic acid antagonism, fetal tissue binding, and toxic effects of metabolic intermediates. Therapy with more than one drug increases the risk of congenital malformations. A unique hemorrhagic phenomenon in the infants of epileptic mothers has been reported and appears to be the result of a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. When taken by a pregnant woman, all antiepileptic drugs except valproic acid manifest themselves in breast milk, but only if the infant exhibits evidence of sedation should breastfeeding be discontinued. The dilemma for the physician treating the pregnant epileptic woman is to protect the mother from seizures and the fetus from unnecessary exposure to anticonvulsant medications.\r"

The nature of the cognitive disability may to a certain extent depend on the seizure type. Partial seizures, mainly derived from a temporal lobe focus, impair memory tasks, while generalized seizures seem to have more effect on attentional abilities. A number of studies, reviewed in this paper, suggest that anticonvulsant drugs further impair cognitive function. Maximal impairments are seen in patients receiving polytherapy: rationalization of polytherapy improves cognitive abilities. Studies in children and adults have allowed differentiation of the effects of various commonly used antiepileptic agents. Maximal cognitive deficits are seen with phenytoin, while phenobarbital and sodium valproate induce moderate disturbances, and carbamazepine seems relatively free from such toxicity. Further research is needed on the interrelationship between types of seizure disorders, types of anticonvulsant medications, and cognitive function.\r"

A total of 622 patients, either previously untreated or undertreated, were entered into the study. Strict exclusion criteria limited confounding factors such as drug or alcohol abuse. Results showed that each of the four drugs used as monotherapy were similarly effective in the treatment of generalized tonic clonic seizures, but carbamazepine was significantly more effective in the treatment of complex partial seizures as measured by 100% control. When the results for all four drugs were combined, the data showed that approximately 80% of the patients were adequately managed on monotherapy. Differences in toxicity were the most significant factor that discriminated between these four drugs. Both carbamazepine and phenytoin were associated with significantly lower incidences of intolerable side effects than were primidone or phenobarbital. A behavioral toxicity battery was performed whenever possible prior to administration of any antiepileptic drug and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of monotherapy. Significant differences in performance on all subtests of the battery were found between patients with epilepsy and a control group matched by age, sex, and education. When the differential effects of all four drugs on behavioral toxicity were compared, few statistically significant differences emerged. However, carbamazepine consistently produced fewer adverse effects on tests of attention/concentration and motor performance than did the other three antiepileptic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of the principles of drug action and distribution contributes to an understanding of the occurrence of drug interactions. The pharmacologic action of most drugs is postulated to occur by the formation of a drug-receptor complex at the site of action that is capable of altering the physiologic response of the target system. The therapeutic response observed depends on the sum of the numerous factors that can affect the disposition pattern of a drug. In an individual, the response to a given drug dose remains relatively constant, but in a large population, a fixed dose can produce a range of plasma concentrations and therefore varied clinical responses. For most drugs, there is a linear relationship between the total dose and the plasma concentration achieved at steady state. Saturation, or zero-order, kinetics accounts for nonlinear increases in drug concentration with dosage increase. Drug-drug interactions with carbamazepine include several types. (1) Autoinduction of carbamazepine metabolism increases the carbamazepine clearance rate, decreases the half-life, and decreases serum concentrations; the clinician must reevaluate a patient's serum levels at 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of therapy. (2) Carbamazepine induces the metabolism of other antiepileptic drugs, enhancing the clearance of phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid, clonazepam, and ethosuximide. (3) Other drugs added to the epileptic patient's drug regimen may induce the metabolism of carbamazepine, causing increased serum concentrations. (4) Inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism by other drugs can also occur; symptoms of drug intoxication rapidly follow. Interactions occur between carbamazepine and macrolide antibiotics, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and isoniazid. Drug-drug interactions are preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite the widespread and traditional use of polytherapy in the treatment of epilepsy, there is little evidence of its advantages over monotherapy. Among other undesirable effects, it can produce subtle cognitive and behavioral changes and sometimes even exacerbate the epilepsy. Recent studies provide evidence that in many patients seizures can be controlled by carefully monitored monotherapy: Approximately 75% of newly diagnosed, previously untreated epileptic patients will enter a 2-year remission with this form of treatment. The theory has even been advanced that early control of seizures may help prevent the evolution of drug-resistant, chronic epilepsy. In some patients with chronic epilepsy, multiple-drug therapy can be reduced to single-drug treatment, usually with an improvement in cognitive function and without increase in seizures. Trials conducted to date have shown no evidence of superiority of any one major antiepileptic drug over another in control of a particular seizure type. The choice of antiepileptic drug for monotherapy may therefore be influenced by differences in toxic effects associated with individual agents. On the basis of clinical and psychometric evidence, carbamazepine has been shown to cause fewer adverse effects than other antiepileptic drugs on cognitive function, mood, and behavior.\r"

Physicians who were young, had recently received their MD degree and had been educated in Israel had by far the most positive attitudes towards social workers. Those aged over 60 years old, who had received their MD degree in Western countries more than 25 years ago were more positively inclined towards social work in the clinics than middle-aged physicians educated in Eastern European countries. The personal characteristics of the nurses made little difference to their generally poor attitude towards social work in the clinics. Those who received their nursing education more recently were more positive than other nurses.\r"

Three stages of this research are described in this paper and the results reveal a complex and fascinating set of human beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Concern for health was not a consistent human characteristic and there was little evidence for the existence of a general preventive orientation in the cohorts studied. Discrepancies between expressed health beliefs/attitudes and behaviours are more explicable when the reality of ambiguity and paradox is recognized in human responses. Human responses to loss (grief) may have similarities to the respondents' experiences when facing a possible change of life-style for health reasons. The practical implications for primary care professionals are discussed.\r"

It was found that mucosal hyperplasia develops in the absence of any bacterial contamination and that bacterial association does not lead to a more pronounced mucosal proliferation.

Comparing the trophic effect both of BAY m 1099 and BAY o 1248 with that of the almost unabsorbed glucosidase inhibitor acarbose in fed rats showed that caecal weight was higher in response to the absorbed compounds than in response to acarbose, while total caecal carbohydrate content was unaffected by the absorbed and about nine fold increased by the unabsorbed inhibitors.

Early stages of neoplastic growth in the pancreas have been studied in carcinogen treated animals and preneoplastic lesions including atypical acinar cell foci and nodules, tubular ductal complexes and intraductal hyperplasia were identified. Neoplastic growth is clonal rather than diffuse and involves multiple steps through preneoplastic stages to produce a tumour. The individual steps are commonly regarded as reflecting a series of changes in the genome of the cells. Although the changes are likely to be irreversible, completion of the sequence usually requires a major portion of the lifespan of the host. The rate of progression of preneoplastic lesions to cancer may be modulated by the same factors that control adaptive growth. It follows that such factors will influence the probability that a carcinoma will develop. Cholecystokinin (CCK) seems to provide one example of a hormone/growth factor that can stimulate normal, adaptive, and neoplastic growth, and it is to be expected that other such hormones will be identified.\r"

Furthermore, we reported that pancreatic acini have specific receptors for IGF I and II, and using different techniques (acid washing, trypsinisation, electron microscope autoradiography), that CCK8 reduces the internalisation of IGF II. To now directly study the long term role for IGF and insulin in the exocrine pancreas we used AR42J cells, a rat cell line that is derived from a transplantable tumour of the acinar pancreas. Hormone binding studies with 125I-labelled hormones indicated that those cells have insulin receptors, relatively fewer receptors for IGF II but in contrast with normal acini no detectable IGF I receptors. Insulin at concentrations as low as 1 nm stimulated the growth of AR42J cells, as measured by an increase in cell number, DNA and protein content. At 100 nM insulin had maximal effects stimulating the growth by about 50%. IGF I and II had only very weak growth promoting effects probably due to their interaction with the insulin receptor. Additionally insulin increased amylase synthesis over the same concentration range that it stimulated growth. But immunoprecipitation studies revealed that insulin induced a selective increase of amylase synthesis over general protein synthesis. These studies indicate, therefore, that insulin is a growth promoting hormone for AR42J cells and that additionally it seems to specifically regulate amylase synthesis. The role for the IGFs in the exocrine pancreas, however, still remains to be determined.\r"

Physiological (lactation) and surgical (jejunoileal bypass) models of hyper- and hypoplasia were established so that insulin receptor characteristics could be related to villus histology, expression of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase, and plasma insulin concentrations. In lactating rats, villus height increased up to 55% (p less than 0.005), and fasting plasma insulin increased 71% (p = 0.005), compared with controls. Insulin binding to villus cell membranes, and sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities were, however, unchanged. In ileum of bypass operated rats, villus height increased 134% (p less than 0.005) while insulin binding fell 68% (p = 0.025). Scatchard analysis revealed that this was largely because of reduction in binding by high affinity receptors. Sucrase and alkaline phosphatase specific activities fell 57% (p = 0.03) and 49% (p = 0.02) respectively, suggesting that ileal villus cells were hypomature. The slightly hypoplastic tissue of selfemptying loops showed normal insulin binding compared to jejunum of sham operated controls. Bypass and sham operated rats had similar fasting plasma insulin concentrations. Reduced insulin binding in markedly hyperplastic gut of bypass operated rats might reflect hypomaturity of villus cells. The reduction in insulin binding, however, might significantly modulate the effect of insulin on small intestinal mucosa and account for the fall in enzyme activity which occurs despite villus hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "During growth and differentiation the plasma membrane has a key role not only in the reception and transmission of extracellular signals such as hormones and growth factors, but also in communicating cellular response to the cellular microenvironment. Cellular response to trophic stimuli includes alterations of cell shape and cell surface antigenicity, of cell-cell recognition and cellular adhesion, of cell matrix binding and the adaptation of cell surface receptors. The plasma membrane is therefore regarded as a 'central agency' for the integration of a single cell into the complex system of a tissue or of an organism. The numerous functions of the plasma membrane are mainly mediated by membrane integrated glycoproteins or glycolipids both sharing the common feature of covalently bound oligosaccharide side chains. Specific alterations of oligosaccharide structure and metabolism associated with growth, differentiation and various pathologic conditions suggest a specific role for the oligosaccharide moieties in the regulation of cell surface functions (Table 1). This review intends to focus on the role of plasma membrane glycoproteins describing briefly principles of glycoprotein structure and function, and characteristics of their biosynthesis and degradation.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors are typically classified as peripheral vasodilators. We studied the effect of captopril and a known vasodilator, hydralazine, on arterial pressure-urinary output relationships in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats to determine whether these drugs produced similar changes in this relationship. Tail-cuff pressure and 24-hour urine output and sodium excretion were measured under steady state conditions during ingestion of tap water or saline (1% NaCl) ad libitum. Sodium intake increased seven to nine times when rats drank saline, but in the absence of drug treatment, tail-cuff pressure was not altered significantly (water, 213 +/- 3 vs saline, 220 +/- 5 mm Hg). Daily administration of captopril (100 mg/kg p.o.) or hydralazine (15 mg/kg p.o.) for 2 weeks lowered tail-cuff pressure significantly (175 +/- 3 and 166 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.01) while rats drank tap water. Continued administration of hydralazine plus 2 weeks of drinking saline did not alter tail-cuff pressure (162 +/- 4 mm Hg), but with the addition of saline during captopril treatment, tail-cuff pressure was elevated significantly (210 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Thus, hydralazine produced a parallel shift of the arterial pressure-urinary output relationship along the pressure axis. In contrast, captopril produced a marked change in the slope of this relationship, making arterial pressure extremely salt-sensitive. The results suggest that the two drugs have different effects on the mechanisms that contribute to the long-term control of arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of graded lower body negative pressure (-10 and -40 mm Hg) on vascular resistance and plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity were assessed in seven hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy and seven sex-matched and age-matched normotensive subjects. In both groups increasing levels of lower body negative pressure induced a progressive decrease in right atrial pressure and an increase in vascular resistance. In normal subjects plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity were progressively raised, whereas only the higher level of stimulation increased plasma renin activity, norepinephrine, and vasopressin in hypertensive subjects. Propranolol induced a significant increase in plasma vasopressin in normal subjects (from 1.3 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.1 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) but not in hypertensive subjects. In this latter condition -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure failed to increase plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity in normal subjects. Propranolol abolished the change in plasma renin activity in both groups, reduced the increase in vascular resistance induced by -40 mm Hg lower body negative pressure in normotensive subjects, but did not modify the rise in vasopressin elicited by this stimulus in normal subjects or the humoral and hemodynamic reflex responses evoked in hypertensive subjects. These results suggest that cardiopulmonary receptors are involved in the control of vasopressin release in normal subjects, whereas in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy, this control is altered because of an impaired function of cardiopulmonary receptors.\r"

Whether the enhanced insulin binding explains the exercise-induced increase in glucose uptake is unclear, since insulin binding and glucose uptake have not been measured simultaneously in a target tissue of insulin. In this study, we determined insulin binding and the rate of glucose transport in adipocytes obtained by needle biopsy from 10 healthy men before and after 3 h of cycle-ergometric exercise. During the exercise, plasma glucose (P less than 0.01) and insulin (P less than 0.001) fell and serum free fatty acid level rose 4.3-fold (P less than 0.001). 125I-insulin binding to adipocytes remained unchanged during exercise. The rate of basal glucose transport clearance fell from 28.1 +/- 5.7 fl.cell-1.s-1 to 22.9 +/- 5.6 fl.cell-1.s-1 (P less than 0.005), and the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose transport rate rose from 196 +/- 26 to 279 +/- 33% (P less than 0.025) during the exercise. Thus, in the adipocytes during exercise, the basal glucose transport rate and the responsiveness of glucose transport to insulin changed in the absence of alterations in insulin binding. These data indicate that the exercise-induced changes in insulin binding show tissue specificity and do not always parallel alterations in glucose transport.\r"

Rla was measured using a low-frequency sound method (Sekizawa et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 591-597, 1983) and Rrs by forced oscillation at 3 Hz. In normal subjects, both Rla and Rrs significantly decreased after a voluntary deep breath (0.05 less than P less than 0.01). During methacholine provocation in the normal subjects, a voluntary deep breath significantly decreased Rrs (0.05 less than P less than 0.01, but Rla was significantly increased (0.05 less than P less than 0.01). In 10 asthmatic subjects in remission, a voluntary deep breath significantly increased Rrs (0.05 less than P less than 0.01) but significantly decreased Rla (0.05 less than P less than 0.01). In another 10 asthmatic subjects during spontaneous mild attacks, a voluntary deep breath significantly increased both Rrs and Rla (0.05 less than P less than 0.01). The present study showed that without obvious bronchoconstriction, Rla decreased after a voluntary deep breath in both normal and asthmatic subjects but, with bronchoconstriction, Rla increased in both groups. Subtraction of the change in Rla from Rrs gives the change in Rrs below the larynx (Rlow). Rlow changed little or decreased in normal subjects and increased in asthmatic subjects, irrespective of base-line bronchomotor tone. These results suggest that airway response below the larynx after a voluntary deep breath differentiates patients with bronchial asthma from normal subjects.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of 3 h of HFV and CMV on total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), the shape of the pressure-volume (PV) curve (%V10), and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as venous admixture and alveolar-arterial O2 gradient. We studied a total of 12 dogs at lung inflations equivalent to 15 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (group I) and 8 dogs at lung inflations equivalent to 0 cmH2O PEEP (group II). For CMV, we used a standard-volume ventilator at a mean tidal volume of 13.8 ml/kg. For HFV, we used an oscillator-type ventilator at 15 Hz and an average tidal volume of 4.3 ml/kg. Our results showed that ventilation with 3 h of PEEP raised lung volume, and lung volumes on HFV were higher than those on CMV in both groups. Specifically, in group I, the volume during ventilation rose on both CMV (150 ml) and HFV (250 ml). These volume changes persisted beyond the ventilation period, such that TLC was unchanged on CMV but had risen 200 ml on HFV. FRC also rose 200 and 300 ml after HFV and CMV, respectively. In group II, the volume during ventilation fell 100 ml on CMV and rose slightly (40 ml) on HFV. TLC and FRC both tended to fall more on CMV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clearance of lung radioactivity was expressed as percent decrease per minute. Base-line clearance was measured while anesthetized sheep (n = 20) were ventilated with 0 cmH2O end-expiratory pressure. Clearance was remeasured during ventilation at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 cmH2O PEEP. Further studies showed stepwise increases in functional residual capacity (FRC) (P less than 0.05) measured at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O PEEP. At 2.5 cmH2O PEEP, the clearance rate was not different from that at base line (P less than 0.05), although FRC was increased from base line. Clearance rate increased progressively with increasing PEEP at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O (P less than 0.05). Between 15 and 20 cmH2O PEEP, clearance rate was again unchanged, despite an increase in FRC. The pulmonary clearance of aerosolized 99mTc-DTPA shows a sigmoidal response to increasing FRC and PEEP, having both threshold and maximal effects. This relationship is most consistent with the hypothesis that alveolar epithelial permeability is increased by lung inflation.\r"

Nine male subjects performed a standardized maximal treadmill test with and without acute captopril treatment (25 mg orally). At rest, captopril elevated plasma renin activity and lowered aldosterone levels. With maximal exercise, captopril treatment reduced the increase in mean arterial blood pressure by 8 mmHg and the increase in plasma renin activity by 3.0 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1. The responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, and vasopressin to maximal exercise were not altered by captopril treatment. Although aldosterone levels were reduced at rest with captopril, during maximal exercise no difference was noted between treatments. Captopril treatment had no effects on the renal handling of salts or water during exercise. In conclusion, angiotensin II plays a role in the increase in mean blood pressure during maximal exercise in normal subjects but has no effect on the exercise responses of ACTH, vasopressin, and aldosterone or on the renal handling of salts and water.\r"

Plasma levels of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha(6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2), stable metabolites of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassay. Although TxB2 levels were not different before and after inoculation in either group, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels increased from their base-line value in each animal as pneumonia developed (indomethacin group: less than 100 to 330 +/- 90 pg/ml; control group: less than 100 to 630 +/- 300 pg/ml). Both prostaglandins fell to less than 100 pg/ml in each dog after indomethacin infusion, whereas they remained elevated in the control group after infusion of normal saline. Perfusion of consolidated lung regions (Qp/QT), measured with radioactive microspheres and expressed as a percent of total pulmonary blood flow, was dramatically reduced after indomethacin (35 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 1%) with consequent improvement in pulmonary shunt (Qs/QT: 30 +/- 8 to 18 +/- 6%) and arterial O2 tension (PaO2: 123 +/- 25 to 274 +/- 77 Torr). These parameters remained unchanged or deteriorated further in the control group after infusion of saline. Three additional dogs with Pseudomonas pneumonia were studied in which the indomethacin-induced reduction in Qp/QT was substantially but not completely reversed by intravenous infusion of PGI2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism underlying temperature-induced changes in airway cholinergic contractility, the effects of organ bath cooling were evaluated in isolated rabbit airway smooth muscle (ASM) segments isometrically contracted with methacholine (METH) (10(-8)-10(-3) M) and electrical field stimulation (ES), wherein the ES stimulus frequency was varied between 1 and 100 Hz. Cooling from 37 to 25 degrees C produced systematic increases (P less than 0.01) in isometric tension at various administered doses of METH and at different levels of ES. Since the potentiated contractions to ES significantly exceeded (P less than 0.001) the corresponding increases in METH-induced contractility, we evaluated whether the latter was attributed to temperature-mediated changes in intrinsic airway neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Accordingly, the effects of ASM cooling were independently determined before and after inhibition of the Na+-K+ electrogenic pump with ouabain (10(-5) M), and depletion of intrinsic neuronal ACh stores with hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) (10(-3) M). In the presence of either ouabain or HC-3 the above responses to temperature reduction were reversed, and airway cooling was associated with abrupt relaxation of ASM segments precontracted with METH. In contrast, neither inhibition of cyclooxygenase products with indomethacin (10(-6) M) nor cholinesterase inhibition with neostigmine (10(-3) M) notably influenced the ASM responses to organ bath cooling. Thus these findings demonstrate that 1) both METH-induced and neurally mediated cholinergic contractility are augmented during airway cooling; 2) the potentiated cholinergic responses are attributed to enhanced presynaptic release of ACh at the airway neuromuscular junction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Frequency-response curves generated by bilateral stimulation of the vagus nerves (0-20 Hz, 15-20 V, 2-ms duration) elicited greater maximal contraction in mongrel trachea (36.8 +/- 8.1 vs. 26.9 +/- 4.0 g/cm; P less than 0.02) and exhibited greater responsiveness in mongrel BSM (half-maximal response to electrical stimulation 3.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.5 Hz; P less than 0.05) compared with BG dogs. However, muscarinic sensitivity to intravenous methacholine (MCh) was substantially greater in BG dogs; MCh caused contraction greater than 1.5 g/cm at a mean dose of 3.0 X 10(-10) mol/kg for BG dogs compared with 5.1 X 10(-9) mol/kg for mongrel controls (P less than 0.03, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). In contrast to the muscarinic response, the contractile response elicited by intravenous norepinephrine after beta-adrenergic blockade was similar in trachea and bronchus for both mongrel and BG dogs. Our data confirm previous in vitro demonstration of tracheal hyporesponsiveness in BG dogs and demonstrate that the contraction resulting from efferent parasympathetic stimulation is less in the BG than mongrel dogs. However, postsynaptic muscarinic responsiveness of BG BSM is substantially increased. We conclude that a component of airway responsiveness in BG dogs depends directly on contractile forces generated postsynaptically that are nongeometry dependent, postjunctional, and agonist specific.\r"

To investigate the pathophysiological effects of a polysaccharide toxin from GBS type III cultures, obtained from an infant who died from this disease, young chronically instrumented, unanesthetized lambs were studied with measurements of lung mechanics, lung volumes, ventilation, hemodynamics, and lung vascular permeability. Intravenously administered GBS toxin resulted in a biphasic response with an early threefold increase in total lung resistance, 40% decrease in dynamic lung compliance, and 30% increase in minute ventilation coinciding with hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and fever. A second phase of the response followed consisting of less prominent changes in these variables as well as increased lung lymph protein clearance compatible with increased vascular permeability. The temporal close relationship between marked leukopenia and increased lung lymph thromboxane B2 concentrations to the simultaneously occurring pulmonary hypertension and changes in lung mechanics suggests that leukocytes and thromboxane A2 may be mediators of these GBS toxin-induced effects.\r"

Polyps from 18 cases of familial adenomatous polyposis, 10 of whom had developed malignant change, and 30 normal control colonic biopsy specimens were examined. A consistent staining pattern was observed in normal mucosa; nuclear staining in the basal proliferative zone; mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in the maturation zone; and cytoplasmic localisation in the surface mature zone. In contrast, the polyps and carcinomata showed a mixed pattern of cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation in the basal proliferative zone with nuclear persistence throughout the crypts to the surface mature zone. This abnormal distribution of the c-myc oncogene product may have a role in the evolution of polyps and their subsequent malignant transformation into familial adenomatous polyposis.\r"

A total of 571 cases of Hodgkin's disease and 386 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were included. The sensitivity of CD15 in detecting cases of Hodgkin's disease was 80% or 91% if cases of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease were excluded. The specificity of CD15 was only 80.6%, or in other words, 19.4% of cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were CD15 positive. In an ideal test both the sensitivity and specificity would be 100% and if the test performance were no better than chance then they would both be 50%. It is concluded that CD15 immunostaining cannot be regarded as a sensitive or specific marker of Hodgkin's disease. Application of this formal method of analysis to other immunohistological reagents and panels of antibodies is discussed.\r"

No cardiolipin positive, TPHA negative samples were confirmed as positive by the absorbed fluorescence treponemal antibody test, and overall 78% of cardiolipin reactions gave false biological positive results. Cardiolipin tests were continued only because of their speed. A further modification (\"spin\") of the TPHA has now been developed which is rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive, and in testing 21,807 sera, gave results equivalent to those of the previous \"settle\" method. Serious consideration should be given to dispensing with cardiolipin tests.\r"

These cells superficially resemble small lymphoid cells and are hence difficult or impossible to recognise in conventional Romanowsky stained smears. Circulating micromegakaryocytes were found most commonly in more aggressive types of myelodysplasia (such as refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t], and their presence may therefore indicate a poor prognosis. Because of the simplicity of this immunocytochemical labelling technique, it could be of wide use in the initial assessment of patients with myelodysplasia, and possibly for the early detection of acute leukaemic transformation.\r"

The clinician should be aware of the drugs that can produce adverse reactions on the lungs and stop the administration as soon as possible. In this article, I have classified the drugs known to produce adverse pulmonary effects as follows: chemotherapeutic, cardiovascular, antibiotic, and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs known to induce systemic lupus erythematosus, inhalants, illicit drugs such as heroin, and miscellaneous drugs. There are no blood tests or other means of diagnosing adverse drug effects on the lung. Chest roentgenographic findings are nonspecific. Pulmonary function abnormalities generally correlate with the degree of dyspnea and chest roentgenographic changes. Therefore, the clinician trying to explain the onset of pulmonary symptoms must be aware of the drugs the patient is taking.\r"

This method is widely used and most suitable for expressing results for challenges in subjects with asthma. However, it is impossible to present results in this manner in other circumstances. Normal subjects and many subjects with allergic rhinitis do not have significant bronchial reactivity and will not reach a 20% fall during standard challenge protocols. This limitation precludes the use of this large population in the quantitative analysis necessary in epidemiologic, genetic, or drug studies. To compound this difficulty, a subset of patients with allergic rhinitis may demonstrate a 20% drop but have a subsequent plateau drop in FEV1. Expressing the results of their methacholine challenge with only a PD20 loses valuable information available in the test. We demonstrate that expressing results as the area beneath a dose-response curve provides useful parametric data on all studied subjects and distinguishes among subjects who might otherwise be classified as equivalent when results are expressed solely as a PD20.\r"

The reactions in both patients were morphologically and biochemically similar to the cutaneous late-phase allergic reactions that occur after IgE-mediated, antigen-provoked mast cell degranulation.

A modified direct macrophage migration-inhibition factor (MIF) test for the different drugs was carried out on blood samples from these patients. There was a positive MIF response toward one or more of the suspected drugs in 53.4% of the patients as compared to 4.9% of the control group; 155 of the 243 drugs elicited a positive MIF response. The percentage of positive responses for each particular drug was not related to the number of patients tested, reflecting the variability in specific immunogenicity of the different drugs. The high percentage of positive MIF reactions in relation to the clinical diagnosis suggests that this test can be a useful aid in the detection of the offending drug in cases of suspected drug-induced reactions.\r"

Tryptase, a neutral protease selectively concentrated in human mast cells, appears along with histamine in skin chamber fluid overlying sites of allergen challenge in sensitive human subjects. Maximal amounts of histamine were found 0 minutes to 30 minutes after challenge; maximal amounts of tryptase were found 30 minutes to 60 minutes after challenge. The later appearance of tryptase most likely reflects its slower diffusion through tissue after release of tryptase from cutaneous mast cells as a macromolecular complex with proteoglycan. The mean weight ratio of tryptase (134,000 molecular weight tetramer) to histamine (111 molecular weight) in chamber fluid after allergen challenge during a 1-hour time course was 4:1. Total amounts of tryptase and histamine recovered in the 0.3 ml chamber fluid samples after a 1-hour challenge averaged 95 ng and 26 ng, respectively. Tryptase levels in skin chamber fluid are an accurate indicator of mast cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "88088744\r", 
  ".W": "The processing and presentation of insulin by B hybridoma cells to insulin A loop-specific T cell hybridomas was investigated. We found that the activation of these T cells requires insulin to be processed in a manner that permits unfolding of the molecule and prevents extensive proteolysis. An analysis of insulin peptides formed by either enzymatic digestion in vitro or solid phase synthesis revealed that a conformational determinant comprised of residues A1-A14 disulfide-linked to B7-B15 is most immunogenic to these T cells. Reduction and/or proteolysis of this peptide markedly decreases its immunogenicity. The pork insulin A1-A14/B7-B15 peptide differs only at residue A4 from its mouse insulin homolog. Thus, Glu A4 forms part of the antigenic site recognized by a pork insulin/I-Ad-specific mouse T cell. This insulin peptide can be induced to assume an alpha-helical configuration in a hydrophobic environment. In addition, virtually all of the residues of this peptide are identical with those predicted to be situated in amphipathic regions of the native insulin molecule. N-Ethylmaleimide and bacitracin, which inhibit the activity of two cytosolic enzymes that cleave insulin, enhance the antigen presentation of insulin. This suggests that these enzymes may participate in the nonlysosomal antigen processing of insulin by a B lymphocyte. A comparison of the relative avidity of several T cell hybridomas, which have the same apparent specificity for this insulin peptide, showed that an increase in their avidity was associated with a degeneracy in their fine specificity. Our data demonstrate that the efficiency of processing and presentation of a given antigenic determinant is related to the conformation of the determinant and the specificity and avidity of the T cell.\r"

Surface marker analysis on day 5 after irradiation showed thymocytes with Thy-1low L3T4+/Lyt-2- dominantly existed and suggested that these cells were radioresistant-survived cells. On the other hand, thymocytes on day 7 were composed of a large number of Thy-1high L3T4+/Lyt-2+ blast-like cells and a relatively high proportion of Thy-1high L3T4-/Lyt-2- cells which expressed a large amount of gamma-chain gene messages but scarcely any alpha- and beta-chain gene messages similar to the fetal thymocytes. On day 14, thymocytes were composed mostly of Thy-1high H-2low L3T4+/Lyt-2+ subpopulation which expressed a remarkably low level of gamma-chain gene messages, and high levels of alpha- and beta-chain transcripts analogous to those of normal adult thymus. Taken together, intrathymic radioresistent stem cells for T thymocytes seem to proliferate and differentiate after irradiation with the same pattern as was seen in a fetal thymus development.\r"

  ".W": "Human T and B lymphocyte subsets were characterized for ecto-5'-nucleotidase (ecto-5'-NT) expression by two-color immunofluorescence by using polyclonal goat antibodies to 5'-NT and murine monoclonal antibodies to T and B cell subsets. Anti-5'-NT antibodies were prepared by immunizing a goat with purified human placental 5'-NT. Lymphocyte surface 5'-NT was detected with F(ab')2 fragments of immune goat IgG followed by biotinylated F(ab')2 rabbit anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin. Lymphocyte cell surface antigens were detected with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD16, and anti-CD19. HB-4, an antigen present on a major subset of human peripheral blood B cells, was detected with murine monoclonal anti-HB-4 and PE-anti-mouse-kappa. Analysis showed that ecto-5'-NT was expressed on 32 +/- 7% of CD3+, 19 +/- 6% of CD4+, and 50 +/- 21% of CD8+ T cells, but not on CD16+ lymphocytes. Ecto-5'-NT was also expressed on 81 +/- 8% of adult peripheral blood B cells as defined by PE-anti-CD19; HB-4 was expressed on 84 +/- 7% of CD19+ cells. The two populations of B cells were not identical, however, because HB-4 was co-expressed on only 79 +/- 18% of ecto-5'-NT+ B cells. Two-color immunofluorescent staining of T cells from a patient with congenital agammaglobulinemia and low T cell ecto-5'-NT activity revealed reduced percentages of ecto-5'-NT+ cells in his CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ populations. Thus, reduced ecto-5'-NT activity by enzyme assay was paralleled by reduced numbers of 5'-NT molecules on the cell surface. Two-color immunofluorescent staining of B cells from a patient with hypogammaglobulinemia and low B cell ecto-5'-NT activity also revealed markedly reduced expression of 5'-NT. HB-4 expression was normal, however, suggesting that the patient's B cells were blocked in maturation subsequent to the acquisition of HB-4 but prior to that of ecto-5'-NT. These results demonstrate that anti-5'-NT antibodies will be valuable tools for analyzing ecto-5'-NT expression and lymphocyte maturation in patients with immuno-deficiency diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have established that the cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) is selectively cytotoxic for isolated human and rat pancreatic beta-cells. This observation raises the possibility that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is in part due to immunologically mediated mechanisms involving IL-1. However, other cytokines are produced during immunologic responses. To study possible modulatory effects of other cytokines on IL-1-mediated beta-cell cytotoxicity, we added human recombinant IL-1 alpha and beta (rIL-1 alpha, rIL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (rTNF), lymphotoxin (rLT), and interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) separately or in combinations to the culture medium of isolated rat islets of Langerhans. A half-maximal inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release after 7 days of culture was obtained with 100 pg/ml of rIL-1 beta, whereas 1000 pg/ml of rIL-1 alpha were necessary to obtain an equivalent effect. While ineffective in causing inhibition of beta-cell function or morphologic damage to islets alone 2.5 to 25 ng/ml of rTNF, but not 40 ng/ml of rLT, or 25 ng/ml of rIFN-gamma markedly potentiated the inhibition of beta-cell secretory response and dissolution of islet integrity caused by rIL-1 alpha and beta. The potentiating effect of rTNF was more pronounced if the rTNF was added after 60 min of preincubation of the islets with rIL-1 beta, than if rIL-1 beta was added after 60 min of preincubation with rTNF. rTNF did not interfere with the activity of rIL-1 alpha or beta on lymphocytes. Combinations of rIFN-gamma and rTNF or rLT did not affect beta-cell function. In conclusion, rTNF strongly potentiates the functional inhibition of beta-cells and the morphologic disintegration of islets caused by rIL-1 in vitro. These data, seen in context with previous observations of rIL-1-mediated beta-cell cytotoxicity, suggest that macrophages present in the intra-islet mononuclear cell infiltrate in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may secrete monokines that could be important effector molecules in beta-cell destruction.\r"

One of the active clones contained a cDNA that encoded a recombinant product lacking the 28-amino acid long signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature protein.

The regulation of the acute phase proteins is mediated by hepatocyte-stimulating factors (HSF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) present in the conditioned medium. Purified HSF-I from COLO-16 cells stimulates preferentially alpha 1-acid glycoprotein synthesis, whereas COLO-HSF-II stimulates preferentially the synthesis of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and alpha 1-antitrypsin. HSF from monocytes, which has been identified as interferon-beta 2 (B cell stimulating factor-2), displayed the same activity as COLO-HSF-II. Dexamethasone alone had no effect on acute phase plasma protein synthesis but enhanced the response to various HSF severalfold. IL-1 had a relatively low stimulatory activity on the synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin but strongly reduced the basal expression of fibrinogen. The only synergistic action between IL-1 and HSF (or interferon-beta 2) was noted for the synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Tumor necrosis factor active on other hepatic cells failed to modulate significantly the expression of any plasma proteins in HepG2 cells. These studies showed that for an optimal HepG2-cell response a combination of HSF (or interferon-beta 2), IL-1, and dexamethasone is needed. This finding might indicate the identity of some of those hormones involved in regulation of the hepatic acute phase response in vivo.\r"

Release of IL-1 activity by bacterial toxin-stimulated cells was completely blocked by 10 nM dexamethasone (Dex). We examined the question whether corticosteroids suppress IL-1 production by blocking transcription of IL-1 mRNA, or by blocking IL-1 synthesis at a post-transcriptional step. Northern blot hybridization analysis indicated that Dex, 10 nM, completely blocked accumulation of IL-1 beta-encoding mRNA in U937 cells. Dex-mediated inhibition of IL-1 release appeared to be glucocorticoid receptor-mediated and was abrogated by progesterone. In addition, Dex at high concentrations could inhibit post-transcriptional synthesis of IL-1 by prestimulated U937 cells. Although Dex, 500 nM, did not change IL-1 mRNA levels in prestimulated cells, it completely blocked IL-1 release and induced a transient increase in cellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Dex-mediated inhibition of IL-1 release in prestimulated cells is likely to occur via increased levels of cAMP, which have been shown to block post-transcriptional IL-1 synthesis. Our results indicate that glucocorticoids suppress IL-1 synthesis by two distinct mechanisms, blocking transcription of IL-1 mRNA during monocyte activation, and blocking post-transcriptional IL-1 synthesis via cAMP.\r"

There is also an 84% inhibition after application from 4 to 6 days following inoculation so that by day 6, there was a disappearance of a significant number of schizonts previously present at day 4, indicating more than a parasitostatic effect, and probably a postassembly action. HuIFN-alpha and -beta were effective, but only at 1000-fold higher concentrations than HuIFN-gamma.

We have generated a number of monoclonal antibodies against gametes and zygotes of the human malaria Plasmodium falciparum. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reacting with a 230-kDa gamete surface protein (mAb 1B3 and 2B4 both isotype IgG2a) were found to block transmission of P. falciparum to mosquitoes. Blocking was complement dependent and this was verified in vitro by the rapid lysis of newly formed gametes and zygotes in the presence of the mAb and active complement. Both mAb reacted by immunofluorescence with the surface of gametes and zygotes from isolates of P. falciparum from various geographical areas. Each mAb immunoprecipitated a 230-kDa protein from 125I-labeled surface proteins of newly formed gametes and zygotes and immunoblotted a protein doublet of about molecular mass 260 and 230 kDa from gametocytes and gametes of P. falciparum. Only the 230-kDa protein is expressed on the surface of newly formed macrogametes and zygotes. The 230-kDa gamete surface protein forms a molecular complex with two proteins of 48 and 45 kDa. The 48- and 45-kDa gamete surface proteins have previously been shown to be targets of mAb which block infectivity of P. falciparum to mosquitoes. The present study now demonstrates that antibodies against the 230-kDa gamete surface protein block transmission of P. falciparum to mosquitoes. The 230-kDa gamete protein is thus a potential candidate for a gamete vaccine.\r"

The original biopsy material was reviewed in each case and reclassified using the British National Lymphoma Investigation criteria. Grade 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was reported in 80 per cent of cases. Ninety per cent of patients presented in stages IE or IIE and were treated with radical local radiotherapy. A 5-year survival of 51 per cent was achieved and a 5-year relapse-free survival of 35 per cent. Stage IE patients had a statistically significant survival advantage compared to stage IIE. Sixty-one per cent of patients relapsed, of whom 74 per cent died from active lymphoma. The abdomen was the most frequent site for relapse with involvement of both nodal and extranodal sites.\r"

The previous finding of subjective improvement in bowel/bladder function at the end of treatment was not confirmed by objective urodynamic assessment. The treatment did not alter disease progression as measured by the Kurtzke disability status scale nor did it alter the rate of acute relapse. There was less deterioration in cerebellar function at one year in the treated patients as measured by the Kurtzke functional systems scale. No other differences were found between the two groups. Psychometric tests and measurements of lymphocyte sub-populations showed no treatment related effects. Evoked potential studies showed no improvements but there was a significant reduction in amplitude of the visual evoked potential in the treated patients at the end of therapy. This might indicate a reversible degree of retinal damage induced by oxygen toxicity.\r"

A control group of 21 patients and a second group of 20 patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage or aneurysm and a group of 26 with other intracranial pathologies were studied. The Doppler flow velocity (DFV) was significantly higher when vasospasm was present. If it was higher than 100 cm/s, the patients were found to have vasospasm in 80% of cases. If Doppler flow velocity was below 100, less than 10% had spasm. Doppler flow velocity was not found to increase following craniotomy in patients not suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage. In subarachnoid haemorrhage patients there was a trend to increased Doppler flow velocity especially in patients who developed neurological deficit. Doppler flow velocity and Initial Slope Index by xenon clearance (ISI) were not found to correlate with clinical grade. The ISI/DFV quotient (which can be shown mathematically to be related to vessel diameter) was found to correlate well with clinical grade. In this largely post-operative group, absolute levels, or rate of change of Doppler flow velocity could not be shown to be related to the onset or existence of neurological deficit.\r"

  ".W": "The nutritionally important trace elements share a high biological activity, implemented through association with enzymes, hormones or vitamins. The same activity responsible for physiological responses at extremely low dietary levels implies the potential for metabolic upset when the elements are ingested at elevated, although still relatively low levels. Selenium provides a classic example of this dichotomy of effects and has generated concerns at both ends of its supply spectrum. Experiences in the Dakotas, mid-19th century, led to identification of toxicity symptoms for which selenium was later shown to be responsible, while separate studies showed that excess selenium was teratogenic in the developing avian fetus. These toxic reactions suggested that selenium might be useful in restricting abnormal cell growth, and recent studies have proved it to be anticarcinogenic in certain specific circumstances. Investigation of selenium's nutrient function has been equally interesting, and when Schwarz showed it to be an essential nutrient in 1957, he began an era of intense research activity. Dietary levels of selenium below 0.02 ppm were found to cause deficiency symptoms affecting muscles, liver and pancreas and glutathione peroxidase was shown to be an active form through which selenium acted to prevent such aberrations. Research continues to seek other active organic combinations for selenium to identify interfering compounds that restrict its bioactivity and to explore biochemical mechanisms involved in its toxicity.\r"

In both lines of mice, food restriction lowered carcass, HKL and liver absolute protein synthesis rates (ASRs) while GIT protein ASR was not affected by food intake. As a result, whole-body protein ASR increased with increasing food intake. It was estimated that heat production from protein synthesis (HrpsE) was responsible for 8.3 and 10.8% of the maintenance energy requirement of CH and Ch mice, respectively. It was also calculated that HrpsE represents 19.4 and 18.3% of the heat increment of growth of CH and Ch mice, respectively. Energetic efficiencies of protein deposition in CH and Ch mice were 58.6 and 66.7%, respectively.\r"

Weanling male Wistar rats were fed an egg white-based diet containing less than 1.1 mg zinc/kg diet ad libitum for 3 wk. Control rats were either pair-fed or ad libitum-fed the basal diet supplemented with 100 mg zinc/kg diet. Net phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins were carried out by an in vitro assay utilizing [gamma-32P]ATP. The membrane proteins were subsequently separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 32P content of gel slices was counted by Cerenkov counting. Erythrocyte filterability was measured as the filtration time of suspensions of erythrocytes, both untreated and preincubated with diamide, under constant pressure. Erythrocyte ghosts from zinc-deficient rats demonstrated greater dephosphorylation of protein bands R1 plus R2 and R7 than pair-fed rats and greater net phosphorylation of band R2.2 than pair-fed or ad libitum-fed control rats (P less than 0.05). Erythrocytes from ad libitum-fed control rats showed significantly longer filtration times than those from zinc-deficient or pair-fed control rats. In conclusion, dietary zinc deficiency alters in vitro patterns of erythrocyte membrane protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, whereas the depression in food intake associated with the zinc deficiency increases erythrocyte filterability.\r"

Groups of mice were fed either a low fat diet or a high fat diet based on corn oil or beef tallow for 2 wk. Energy intake and body weight gain were higher in both lean and obese animals fed the high fat diets than in respective mice fed the low fat diets. Carcass energy gain was greater for the obese than for the lean consuming each of the diets. Both lean and obese mice had a higher energy gain when fed the beef tallow diet than when fed the corn oil, despite isoenergetic intakes of the two diets. The thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue, assessed from measurements of cytochrome oxidase activity and mitochondrial guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) binding, were greater in both lean and obese mice fed the corn oil diet than in those fed the low fat diet. However, GDP binding and cytochrome oxidase activities in lean or obese mice fed the beef tallow diet were not different from those of mice of the same genotype fed the low fat diet. These results indicate that in both lean and obese (ob/ob) mice energy deposition and the stimulation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis during the voluntary hyperphagia induced by feeding high fat diets are influenced by the fatty acid composition of the diet. A diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids appears to result in preferential stimulation of the thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue, particularly in the ob/ob mouse.\r"

Common in alcoholism is the patient's minimization or denial of the disease and its symptoms, thwarting efforts at early diagnosis and intervention. If early diagnosis is to be made, several points should be remembered: 1. Life problems associated with alcohol use are the earliest signs of the disease. 2. There are few reliable early physical symptoms and signs. 3. Laboratory markers of alcoholism are neither sensitive nor specific when used alone as screening tools. 4. Alcoholism questionnaires, e.g., the MAST or the CAGE, should be a part of routine office practice in screening for alcoholism. Effective therapy is available, but early diagnosis is necessary for the best outcome. Gallant has reminded us of the \"tragedy of delayed treatment.\" Early recognition of alcoholism puts the internist, as well as other primary care providers, in the best position to begin the process of healing the patients and their families.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different methods of storage of DBP on its osteoinductive property. Forty-five Long Evan rats were used in this study. Twenty rats were used as donors; the diaphyses of their femoral bones were used for the preparation of DBP. The DBP was divided into four portions that were either lyophilized or frozen at -70 degrees C, -4 degrees C, or kept at room temperature (25 degrees C). All samples were stored under the specified condition for six months. At the time of implantation, fresh DBP was prepared and used as a control. Twenty-five rats were divided equally into five groups. Each group received an implant of either one of the differently preserved and stored samples of DBP or fresh DBP. The animals were killed 60 days following implantation. The implants were excised and processed to obtain 5 micron thick decalcified sections and 3 micron thick undecalcified sections. Semicomputerized histomorphometry was used for the quantification of the newly-formed bone in each implant. Newly-formed bone was detected in all experimental and control groups and there were no statistically significant differences between the various groups. It was concluded that DBP retains its osteoinductivity after lyophilization or preservation at -70 degrees C, -4 degrees C, and 25 degrees C for a period of up to six months, and that the different methods of preservation did not significantly affect the amount of the induced newly-formed bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Extension of the nictitating membrane was classically conditioned to a tone stimulus presented before delivery of an electric shock unconditioned stimulus to the skin over the paraorbital region of the head. Morphine, ethylketocyclazocine and U-50,488H retarded the acquisition of conditioned responses to the tone conditioned stimulus with ethylketocyclazocine being twice as potent as the more specific kappa agonist U-50,488H, and 40 times more potent than the prototypic mu agonist morphine. Control experiments indicated that the retarded acquisition produced by the three opioids was due to an action on associative learning. Doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg of naloxone alone did not affect acquisition of conditioned responses, but did significantly antagonize the retardant effects of all three opioid agonists. On the basis of the parallelism of the dose-effect curves for the three opioid agonists, their order of potency which was remarkably different from potency ratios observed for other measures, e.g. analgesia, and on the finding that all three opioids demonstrated approximately equivalent sensitivity to antagonism by naloxone, it was concluded that the effects of all three opioid agonists on the acquisition of conditioned responses may be mediated by a common receptor.\r"

Steroid infusion raised plasma corticosterone levels similarly in both strains of rat, but there was no effect on resting BP. However, the fall in BP after pentolinium administration was less in the steroid-treated groups of both strains than in their vehicle-injected counterparts. During infusion of pentolinium the ensuing recovery in BP was abolished by captopril administration. Steroid treatment did not affect this recovery but did attenuate the hypotensive effects of captopril. In Long Evans rats, only, there was a further vasopressin-mediated, recovery in BP during the infusion of pentolinium and captopril. This recovery was not accentuated by the presence of the steroid. In a further experiment, infusion of corticosterone acetate after the onset of hypotension (induced by pentolinium, captopril and d(CH2)5DAVP in Long Evans rats or by pentolinium and captopril in Brattleboro rats) caused a progressive increase in BP in both strains. These findings demonstrate a pressor action of corticosterone acetate which is apparent after hypotension induced by ganglionic blockade and which does not necessarily involve any interaction with the renin-angiotensin system or vasopressin.\r"

Bradykinin in the exudate reached a maximum 5 min after the challenge and then decreased quickly. Local treatment with DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid, an inhibitor of kininase I, and captopril, an inhibitor of kininase II in the first 10-min period, each enhanced the vascular permeability increase accompanied by the elevation of the bradykinin level, whereas soybean trypsin inhibitor, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, lowered both vascular permeability and bradykinin. When applied in the period of 3.5 to 4 hr after the challenge, only the kininase II inhibitor was effective in elevating both vascular permeability and the bradykinin level, whereas soybean trypsin inhibitor was ineffective on vascular permeability. A bradykinin-degrading activity appeared in the exudate as early as 10 min after the challenge. These results suggest that bradykinin plays an essential role for the sudden rise of the vascular permeability observed immediately after the infusion of kaolin suspension. In the later stage (3.5-4 hr), bradykinin level remained below the assay limit of 0.07 ng/ml in spite of its active generation, presumably because of its rapid degradation by the kininases, although it still played a definite role in the vascular permeability increase.\r"

Doses of drug for investigation (captopril, 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; isosorbide dinitrate, 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; and dobutamine, 10.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were chosen in anticipation of a 20% increase of cardiac output in animals with heart failure. In animals with heart failure myocardial blood flow was increased by dobutamine and to a lesser extent by captopril. Renal blood flow was increased only by captopril and nitrates. Cerebral blood flow was reduced by captopril in control animals but unaltered in animals with heart failure. The observed alterations of blood flow were similar to those known to occur in humans and indicate that this is a useful model of heart failure for the evaluation of new drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to investigate beta adrenoceptor modulation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves in rat isolated kidney. After preincubation with [3H]norepinephrine, the renal nerves were stimulated at 1 Hz. The stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was taken as an index of norepinephrine release. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity. This effect was abolished by the beta-2 adrenoceptor blocking drug ICI 118551 (0.1 microM) but unaltered by the beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol (0.3 microM). In the presence of a high concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 microM), isoproterenol failed to enhance the S-I outflow of radioactivity. However, a lower concentration of captopril (0.1 microM), which totally abolished the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I (0.1 microM) on the S-I outflow of radioactivity, failed to alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. Angiotensin II (0.03 microM) enhanced markedly the S-I outflow of radioactivity and in the presence of the angiotensin II receptor blocking drug saralasin (0.1 microM) this facilitatory effect was reduced markedly. Saralasin did not alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that stimulation of prejunctional beta-2 adrenoceptors on renal sympathetic nerve endings enhances norepinephrine release. This effect is independent of local angiotensin II production and does not involve activation of prejunctional angiotensin II receptors within the rat kidney. However, the inhibitory effect of a high concentration of captopril (5.0 microM) on beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of norepinephrine release remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to affect plasma glucose levels and insulin release was assessed in rats bearing chronic jugular catheters. The i.v. administration of 8-OH-DPAT (150 micrograms/kg) rapidly promoted a transient hyperglycemia. Despite high glucose levels, insulinemia remained constant. Dose-response curves revealed that maximal hyperglycemia was associated with hypoinsulinemia. Increased glycemia, which was also found to be induced by other 5-HT direct and indirect agonists, lasted longer in food-deprived rats. Evidence for a strong inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on insulin release was reported in rats submitted to i.v. glucose tolerance tests. Pretreatments with the dopaminergic blocker haloperidol, the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the 5-HT2 blocker ketanserin were ineffective. In contrast, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan and the unspecific 5-HT antagonist methiotepin prevented the hyperglycemic and the hypoinsulinemic effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Blockade of these changes by (-)-propranolol (a 5-HT1 blocker), but not by (+)-propranolol, indicated that 5-HT1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediated 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperglycemia. Reserpine pretreatment did not prevent the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Central injection of 8-OH-DPAT induced hyperglycemia, the amplitude of which was equivalent to that measured after i.v. administration. Selective degeneration of serotonergic nerve cells by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine did not prevent 8-OH-DPAT-induced alterations, thus rendering a key role for presynaptic mechanisms unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Quipazine, a nonselective serotonin (5-HT) agonist, has been shown to increase plasma renin activity (PRA). The present study examined the effects of quipazine on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and PRA in conscious, chronically catheterized male rats. Quipazine caused dose (0.3-3.0 mg/kg i.v.)-and time (up to 30 min)-dependent increases in MAP and PRA. The maximum increases in MAP (control = 94 +/- 2 mm Hg, 3 mg/kg = 155 +/- 1 mm Hg) and PRA (nanograms of angiotensin 1 per milliliter per hour; control = 2.5 +/- 0.2, 3 mg/kg = 25.2 +/- 5.9) were observed 5 min after quipazine. HR tended to decrease, but a significant bradycardia was observed only 15 min after 3 mg/kg. The selective 5-HT2 antagonist LY 53857 (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not affect MAP, HR or PRA per se, but at 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg totally abolished the pressor response to quipazine (3 mg/kg). At 0.01 mg/kg, LY 53857 attenuated quipazine-induced hypertension, whereas 0.003 mg/kg was ineffective. Total blockade of quipazine-induced renin secretion was produced by LY 53857 at 0.003 mg/kg, and the response was still reduced by 50% at 0.001 mg/kg. In summary, although quipazine increases arterial pressure and renin secretion, endogenous 5-HT does not tonically control MAP or PRA in conscious, unrestrained, normotensive rats through 5-HT2 receptors. The 10-fold difference in the dose of LY 53857 necessary to block the pressor and renin responses may be due to subtle differences in receptor subtypes, or to pharmacokinetic properties favoring antagonism of quipazine-induced renin secretion.\r"

We performed a comparative study of the DA-ACh interactions, the efficacy of autoreceptor control and the effects of metoclopramide in the OT and the nucleus caudate (striatum). Rabbit brain slices from both regions of the same animal were prelabeled with radioactive DA and/or choline and then superfused. Comparable magnitude of DA and ACh release was evoked by electrical stimulation from both regions. DA release was unaltered, whereas ACh release was inversely related to the stimulation frequency, both in OT and striatum. Apomorphine (APO), a D1-D2 agonist, an LY-171555 (LY), a D2 agonist, inhibited DA and ACh release from OT and striatum with similar EC50 and Emax (maximal percentage of inhibition). However, the maximal degree of inhibition of ACh release achieved with APO, LY or DA in the OT was only one-half that observed in the striatum. In both regions, the inhibitory effects of DA agonists on DA and ACh release were reduced markedly when the number of electrical pulses and/or the frequency of stimulation were increased. l-Sulpiride, a DA D2 antagonist, increased the evoked release of DA and ACh from OT in direct relationship with the frequency of stimulation. In the OT, increases in synaptic DA achieved by administration of amphetamine or by blockade of the neuronal uptake pump with nomifensine inhibited the evoked release of ACh. Again these drug treatments produced only a 40 to 50% inhibition of ACh release. SKF 38393, a D1 agonist, had no effect per se on DA or ACh release in OT slices from control or from reserpine-treated animals (2 mg/kg s.c. for 3 or 7 days). With the exception of one specific dose combination, coadministration of SKF 38393 and LY produced no additive or synergistic effects on DA or ACh release from OT. APO- and LY-induced inhibition of DA and ACh release were antagonized by l-sulpiride. However, 300 nM SCH 23390, a D1 antagonist, reduced APO inhibition of DA and ACh release without affecting the inhibitory action of LY on DA and ACh release. Metoclopramide, \"a DA antagonist with poor limbic activity\", had a similar affinity for OT (pA2: 7.59) and striatal (pA2: 7.59) DA autoreceptors. Its antidopaminergic efficacy on DA receptors modulating ACh release from OT and striatum was also compared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This effect is antagonized by the D-1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390. Activation or blockade of D-2 dopamine, alpha-2 or beta receptors did not stimulate or attenuate the release of [3H]acetylcholine from rabbit retina. Dopamine receptor agonists evoke the release of [3H]acetylcholine with the following order of potency: apomorphine greater than or equal to SKF(R)82526 greater than SKF 85174 greater than SKF(R)38393 greater than or equal to pergolide greater than or equal to dopamine (EC50 = 4.5 microM) greater than SKF(S)82526 greater than or equal to SKF(S)38393. Dopamine receptor antagonists inhibited the dopamine-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine: SCH 23390 (IC50 = 1 nM) greater than (+)-butaclamol greater than or equal to cis-flupenthixol greater than fluphenazine greater than perphenazine greater than trans-flupenthixol greater than R-sulpiride. The potencies of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists at the dopamine receptor mediating [3H]acetylcholine release is characteristic of the D-1 dopamine receptor. These potencies were correlated with the potencies of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists at the D-1 dopamine receptor in rabbit retina as labeled by [3H]SCH 23390, or as determined by adenylate cyclase activity. [3H]SCH 23390 binding in rabbit retinal membranes was stable, saturable and reversible. Scatchard analysis of [3H]SCH 23390 saturation data revealed a single high affinity binding site (Kd = 0.175 +/- 0.002 nM) with a maximum binding of 482 +/- 12 fmol/mg of protein. The potencies of dopamine receptor agonists to stimulate [3H]acetylcholine release were correlated with their potencies to stimulate adenylate cyclase (r = 0.784, P less than .05, n = 7) and with their affinities at [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites (r = 0.755, P greater than .05, n = 8). The potencies of antagonists to inhibit dopamine-evoked [3H]acetylcholine release were correlated with their potencies to inhibit the dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (r = 0.759, P less than .05, n = 5) and with their affinities at [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites (r = 0.998, P less than .01, n = 7). We conclude that in rabbit retina dopamine evokes calcium-dependent [3H]acetylcholine release through activation of a site with the pharmacological characteristics of a D-1 dopamine receptor.\r"

We studied the mechanism of action of this peptide, and of the related tachykinin, substance K (SK), on both tissue preparations. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin (1 microM) or aspirin (100 microM), in combination with phosphoramidon (1 microM) effectively block SP-induced contractions in lung parenchymal strips. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 microM), the H1 antihistamine, pyrilamine (1 microM) and the anticholinergic agent, atropine (1 microM), all had no significant effect on SP-induced contractions. No detectable levels of thromboxane B2, or prostaglandins D2, E2, F2 alpha, or 6-keto-F1 alpha were released into the tissue bathing fluid. These data suggest that the contractile response of guinea pig lung parenchymal strips is mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites, which are not released in significant concentration from the cells. In the presence of phosphoramidon, SK has a concentration-response curve similar to SP on guinea pig lung parenchymal strips. Its contractile activity is also inhibited by indomethacin but less effectively than SP. In marked contrast, the contractile responses of guinea pig tracheal tissues to the tachykinins were not affected significantly by indomethacin, alone or in combination with phosphoramidon. Additionally, tracheal tissue is 20- to 100-fold more sensitive to SK than SP in the presence or absence, respectively, of the endopeptidase inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tiletamine hydrochloride is a lipophilic and potent veterinary anesthetic. This study shows tiletamine to be similar to ketamine and to phencyclidine, agents known to interact with the NMA receptor. Effects of tiletamine on synaptic transmission and on direct excitatory responses to exogenous amino acids were examined in rat hippocampal and striatal slices. In striatal slices, tiletamine inhibited the NMA-mediated, but not the spontaneous, release of [3H]acetylcholine, with an IC50 of 70 nM. In hippocampal CA1 cells, 3 microM tiletamine in the perfusate reversibly blocked the intracellularly recorded responses to ionophoretically applied NMA, but not to glutamate, quisqualate and kainate. Tiletamine, 3 to 100 microM, had no effect on the orthodromically elicited excitatory postsynaptic potential, action potential amplitude or duration, resting membrane potential, or input resistance. In Mg++-free perfusate, the excitatory postsynaptic potential was greatly augmented to give a paroxysmal depolarization shift and was reversibly blocked by 10 microM tiletamine. Our results show that tiletamine is a potent and reversible antagonist of NMA-mediated responses without itself having major effects in low concentrations on normal membrane and synaptic pyramidal cell properties.\r"

In U50,488-trained pigeons, the kappa agonist bremazocine occasioned drug-appropriate responding during substitution tests, whereas ethylketocyclazocine and ketocyclazocine occasioned intermediate levels of drug-appropriate responding up to and including doses that markedly suppressed response rates. The mu agonists morphine, l-methadone and fentanyl produced responding predominantly on the water-appropriate key. In morphine-trained pigeons, l-methadone, fentanyl, ethylketocyclazocine and ketocyclazocine, but not U50,488 and bremazocine, occasioned drug-appropriate responding. Nonopioid compounds, such as d-amphetamine, pentobarbital, phencyclidine and (+)-SKF 10,047 produced responding predominantly on the water-appropriate key in both U50,488- and morphine-trained pigeons. During tests of antagonism, a 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg dose of naloxone antagonized completely the discriminative stimulus properties of the training dose of U50,488 and morphine, respectively. In addition, morphine displayed a substantially longer duration of action than U50,488, in that intermediate levels of drug-appropriate responding were evident as long as 4 hr after the administration of morphine and only 1 hr after the administration of U50,488. Over a period of approximately 8 months, the dose-effect curves for the discriminative stimulus properties of both drugs were unchanged. The present findings illustrate further the unique behavioral response of pigeons to the discriminative stimulus properties of the kappa agonists, and establishes that pigeons can discriminate between mu and some kappa agonists.\r"

The surface area of jugular veins in humans is much smaller than in dogs and considerably longer grafts are needed. Moreover, the reproductive capacity of adult human endothelial cells under in vivo conditions, which probably determines the success of seeding more than the seeding density, is also uncertain. Therefore the efficiency of autologous endothelial seeding in humans was investigated in 18 patients undergoing distal femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The average surface area of the jugular veins was 4.9 +/- 1.7 cm2 with an average cell yield of 32.6 +/- 18.0 x 10(4). The mean number of seeded cells per square centimeter of graft surface was 3.1 x 10(3). In a follow-up extending for 14 weeks, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin as well as the platelet function in the whole blood aggregometer showed significantly better results in the seeded group. Plasma thromboxane B2, uptake and survival of indium 111-labeled platelets, and Doppler ultrasound investigations also favored the seeded group, but the results were statistically insignificant. No difference at all was found for the platelet dense granule compounds, releasable adenosine triphosphate and platelet serotonin. Thus our findings did not indicate the development of a closed endothelialized surface after 14 weeks, which is a period three times as long as the one required for confluent endothelial cell coverage in dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88091162\r", 
  ".W": "Because prosthetic neointima produces much less prostacyclin (PGI2) than arterial intima and may be more susceptible to cyclooxygenase inhibition, aspirin treatment might enhance surface thrombogenesis. To test this hypothesis, aortic prostheses were placed in eight dogs and measurements of platelet survival and platelet serotonin (5HT) were made under conditions of no treatment and treatment with low-dose (2mg/kg) and high-dose (30 mg/kg) aspirin. These doses equally suppressed platelet function. Measurements were performed preoperatively, 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively (when little neointima was present), and 28 to 32 weeks postoperatively (neointima fully developed). Platelet survival and 5HT levels were markedly reduced 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and returned to normal at 28 to 32 weeks after implantation. At all times, low-dose aspirin improved platelet survival and this effect was most apparent 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Treatment with either aspirin dose decreased platelet 5HT levels at the 28 to 32 week postoperative period but not at other times. At recovery of prostheses, 90% of the luminal surface was covered with endothelialized neointima. Neointimal production of PGI2 was one half to one third that of aortic production. Despite this, low- and high-dose aspirin equally suppressed PGI2 production from both neointima and aorta. Furthermore, aspirin did not increase labeled platelet uptake on neointima. We conclude that (1) aspirin treatment does not render prosthetic neointima thrombogenic and (2) aspirin alters platelet survival and 5HT levels by mechanisms other than inhibition of platelet and neointima cyclooxygenase.\r"

  ".U": "88091727\r", 
  ".W": "The transplantable, hormone-dependent, human prostatic carcinoma PC-82 was used as an in vivo model for monitoring the proliferative fraction of tumor cells under the influence of androgen withdrawal and resubstitution. The number of cycling cells was assessed by means of an immunoperoxidase method and monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The number of Ki-67-positive tumor cells dropped from an average of 17% in androgen-supplemented, tumor-bearing female BALB/c mice to approximately 1.0% within 10 days after removal of the testosterone (T) implant. A similar effect was noted after castration of tumor-bearing male BALB/c mice. Androgen resubstitution after a 10-day period of T deprivation resulted in a rise in the tumor cell proliferation index to 20% within 4 days. The same pattern of response to androgen depletion and resubstitution also was found when the number of cycling cells in S phase was assessed by the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation technique. Administration of supraphysiologic doses of T in intact male mice did not lead to an increase in the number of Ki-67-stained nuclei. Androgen manipulation did not influence the immunohistochemically assessed expression of prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen. The rapid effect of hormone deprivation and resubstitution in the tumor cell proliferation fraction suggests that monoclonal antibody Ki-67 can be used for monitoring the short-term effects of hormonal treatment of prostatic cancer.\r"

In all chemotherapy, it is critical to know what the infecting organisms are, and if that information is not immediately available, to base chemotherapy on those organisms that characteristically produce the infection. It also is critical to have an understanding of the distribution of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in one's community if the proper antimicrobial agent is to be selected. The host's status and site of the infection will impact upon the choice of drug. Infection in sites in which phagocytic function is poor, such as in heart valves or in the spinal fluid, or in individuals lacking complement, white blood cells, or immunoglobulins, must be treated with bactericidal agents. An understanding of the pathogenesis of infection caused by different microorganisms will provide insights into the type of therapy, duration, and amount of drug that must be used. Ultimately, the chemotherapy of infection should be based on integration of the activity of antimicrobial agents with their pharmacologic properties.\r"

They were randomly allocated to receive in addition either prednisolone or placebo for the first 11 weeks; the comparison was double-blind throughout treatment and follow-up.

During follow-up, 2 (4%) of the 53 prednisolone and 7 (11%) of the 61 placebo patients died from pericarditis, and 11 (21%) and 18 (30%), respectively, required pericardiectomy.

Despite this, true ectopic PTH production has seldom been documented in HHM. A number of bone-resorbing factors, including prostaglandins, prostaglandin-stimulating factors, lymphokines, growth factors, and vitamin-D-like sterols, have been implicated as causes of HHM, but none can reproduce the PTH-like biochemical features characteristic of the syndrome. PTH-related peptides have recently been isolated from tumours associated with HHM. These substances are the most likely putative humoral mediators of HHM, since they are structurally similar to PTH in the aminoterminal region and interact with the PTH receptor in vitro. However, the remainder of the molecule is quite distinct from PTH, which accounts for the absence of PTH immunoreactivity in serum and tumour extracts from HHM patients. Since these factors seem to act by binding to the PTH receptor, synthetic PTH antagonists may in the future be a means of treating HHM.\r"

The difference in response between the two treatment groups was also highly significant (p less than 0.01), as was the difference between values for hydroxyprolinuria/creatininuria (p less than 0.01). Endogenous calcitonin levels rose significantly in the calcium group but remained unchanged in calcitonin-treated patients.

  ".W": "There is controversy over whether therapy to prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be selected noninvasively (by trying drugs and monitoring the patient electrocardiographically) or invasively (by selecting a drug that prevents induction of the arrhythmia by programmed stimulation). We randomly assigned 57 patients with symptomatic and demonstrable ventricular tachyarrhythmias to therapy selected either noninvasively or invasively. The tachyarrhythmias involved were sustained ventricular tachycardia (35 patients), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with hypotension (15 patients), and ventricular fibrillation (7 patients). The noninvasive approach sought reduction of ventricular premature beats by more than 80 percent and of couplets by more than 90 percent, with elimination of three or more successive ventricular beats on ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing. The invasive approach sought to prevent the induction of five or more repetitive beats by programmed stimulation. The noninvasive approach required fewer drug trials (3.2 +/- 1.8 [mean +/- SD] vs. 5.5 +/- 2.8, P less than 0.001) and fewer hospital days (20 +/- 15 vs. 33 +/- 24, P = 0.01) and identified a therapy predicted to be effective for more patients than did the invasive approach (29 of 29 vs. 15 of 28, P less than 0.001). When a predicted effective therapy was not found, amiodarone was prescribed despite persisting inducibility of ventricular tachycardia. Patients randomly assigned to the noninvasive approach had more symptomatic recurrences of tachyarrhythmia than those treated by the invasive approach (two-year actuarial probabilities of 0.50 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.08, P = 0.02). Similar differences were observed when amiodarone recipients were excluded. There were only three deaths from recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias--two in the group whose treatment was selected noninvasively and one in the group whose treatment was selected invasively (not significant). We conclude that therapy selected by the invasive approach prevents recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias better than that selected by the noninvasive approach.\r"

Single-organism gram-negative bacteremia occurred in 129 of 872 evaluable patients. Without a change in antibiotics, the response rates were 81 percent with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin, 48 percent with ceftazidime and short-course amikacin (P = 0.002), and 40 percent with azlocillin and long-course amikacin (P less than 0.001). Among patients with fewer than 100 granulocytes per cubic millimeter throughout therapy, the response rates were 6 percent with ceftazidime and short-course amikacin and 50 percent with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin (P = 0.03). Linear logistic-regression analysis showed that therapy with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin was the most favorable prognostic factor of the response to infection, whereas the presence of leukemia or shock was the least favorable. We conclude that ceftazidime should be given in combination with a conventional full course of an aminoglycoside (amikacin) when used for the empirical treatment of gram-negative bacteremia in cancer patients with granulocytopenia.\r"

  ".W": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a human X-linked biochemical defect resulting in the progressive wasting of skeletal muscle of affected individuals. It is the most common and is considered to be the most devastating of the muscular dystrophies, affecting about 1 in 3,500 live-born males. The gene that, when defective, results in this disorder was recently isolated. Using the cloned complementary DNA sequences corresponding to the DMD gene, antibodies have been produced that react with a protein species of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 400,000 (400K) which was absent in two DMD-affected individuals and in mdx mice. This protein species is called dystrophin because of its identification by molecular-genetic analysis of affected individuals. Here we show that dystrophin is associated with the triadic junctions in skeletal muscle, and is therefore probably involved with Ca2+ homoeostasis. We also show that the approximately 450K ryanodine receptor/sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channel, which has the large size and subcellular distribution characteristics of dystrophin, is an immunologically distinct protein species.\r"

  ".W": "It is now widely accepted that tumour-promoting phorbol esters activate a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) both in vitro and in intact cells, and that the kinase represents a major cellular phorbol ester-binding protein. The phorbol esters act as analogues of diacylglycerol, a natural regulator of protein kinase C, and stabilize the membrane-association of the kinase. Although other molecular targets may exist, protein kinase C activation is probably important in mediating the diverse responses of cultured cells to phorbol esters and in promoting in vivo tumours. The enzyme comprises a family of closely related proteins and has been detected in extracts from mouse epidermal cells, the likely targets for two-stage carcinogenesis in mouse skin. In this report we show that application of a single dose of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate) to mouse skin results in a rapid and complete loss of protein kinase C activity which is maintained for 3-4 days. This is associated with a loss of immunologically detectable protein kinase C and the accumulation of a smaller protein detectable by antibodies recognizing the regulatory domain of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "Use of optical traps for the manipulation of biological particles was recently proposed, and initial observations of laser trapping of bacteria and viruses with visible argon-laser light were reported. We report here the use of infrared (IR) light to make much improved laser traps with significantly less optical damage to a variety of living cells. Using IR light we have observed the reproduction of Escherichia coli within optical traps at power levels sufficient to give manipulation at velocities up to approximately 500 micron s-1. Reproduction of yeast cells by budding was also achieved in IR traps capable of manipulating individual cells and clumps of cells at velocities of approximately micron s-1. Damage-free trapping and manipulation of suspensions of red blood cells of humans and of organelles located within individual living cells of spirogyra was also achieved, largely as a result of the reduced absorption of haemoglobin and chlorophyll in the IR. Trapping of many types of small protozoa and manipulation of organelles within protozoa is also possible. The manipulative capabilities of optical techniques were exploited in experiments showing separation of individual bacteria from one sample and their introduction into another sample. Optical orientation of individual bacterial cells in space was also achieved using a pair of laser-beam traps. These new manipulative techniques using IR light are capable of producing large forces under damage-free conditions and improve the prospects for wider use of optical manipulation techniques in microbiology.\r"

Filtering surgery is not as successful for neovascular glaucoma as it is for the primary adult glaucomas. Therefore, modifications using 5-fluorouracil, carbon dioxide lasers, and alloplastic implants have been investigated. Although ciliary body ablation using cryotherapy or photocoagulation may reduce intraocular pressure, vision may still deteriorate.\r"

The herpesviruses have been found in blood, in blood products, and in saliva, and information with respect to these routes of transmission is convincing. Although hepatitis A virus is spread predominantly by water contaminated with feces (fecal-oral route), the virus is also found in saliva. On these grounds alone, these viruses must be considered a potential hazard in dentistry. Information in regard to the actual risks of their transmission in the context of dental practice is not yet available, primarily because a high proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Serologic studies of their prevalence suggest that all are widespread in the population. They are particularly common in many of the groups known to be at high risk for hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus, including promiscuous homosexuals, bisexuals, and intravenous drug abusers. In addition, pregnant women and their babies are particularly at risk from the herpesviruses. It is important to identify members of these high-risk groups as a potential source of transmission of infection through dental practice and in addition, it is important to identify them because they are prone to chronic sequelae.\r"

Paget cells and tumor cells of Bowen's disease (carcinoma in situ) demonstrated a high incidence of EMA positivity, whereas the frequency in basal cell carcinoma was unexpectedly low. Squamous cell carcinomas revealed positive EMA staining of cytoplasmic membranes, and the antigen was also present in keratinized areas. EMA expression in squamous cell carcinoma generally showed a high incidence (85%) and was higher in keratinized lesions than in unkeratinized or less well-differentiated neoplasms.

When moderate pain and severe pain were combined, the incidence was 21.7%, with no statistically significant difference between periapical instrumentation (15.1%) and intracanal instrumentation (28.3%). An incidence of patients having no postoperative problems of 41.5% was found, with no statistically significant difference between periapical instrumentation (47.2%) and intracanal instrumentation (35.8%). When flare-ups were combined with swelling, the incidence was 34.0%, with no statistically significant difference between periapical instrumentation (32.1%) and intracanal instrumentation (35.8%). When flare-ups were combined with pain, the incidence was 50.0%, with no statistically significant difference between periapical instrumentation (47.2%) and intracanal instrumentation (52.8%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Years of experience are required to thoroughly understand and master tip surgery techniques. While gaining this arduous but invaluable insight, emphasis should always be placed on conservation of tip anatomic structures and avoidance of radical excision and sacrifice of tip tissue. Compulsive long-term follow-up and evaluation of patients, both by frequent examination and review of standardized, uniform photographs, best facilitates the development of expertise in nasal tip surgical refinement.\r"
