Mean activities of the three mitochondrial biotin-dependent carboxylases in the skin of biotin-deficient animals were reduced to 3-18% of control whereas the cytosolic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, was reduced only to 38-61%. The total fatty acid content of haired and alopecic skin of deficient rats was 30% of those in the corresponding skin sites of control animals. Skin from deficient rats contained less of several long-chain fatty acids (16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2) and more very-long-chain fatty acid, particularly 24:1 and 26:1. These alterations in fatty acids in biotin-deficient rats suggest that the skin findings in biotin and biotinidase deficiencies in humans may be due to similar fatty acid changes.\r"

Rats drinking beer lived nearly six times as long and had lower plasma cholesterol, less cardiac enlargement, and higher liver copper. Apparent absorption and biological half-life of oral radiocopper were increased by beer. The effects were not attributable to alcohol, chromium, or copper in beer. Beer intakes were similar to those of some people in the United States. Results may explain seasonal cycles in plasma cholesterol and may be germane to the epidemiology of ischemic heart disease because diets in the United States seem to be low in copper.\r"

This improvement could not be adequately explained except with reference to changes in the protein composition of the products. The protein fraction profiles of the soy products were obtained by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. An inverse relationship between food iron absorption and the high-molecular-weight fraction of the soy products was demonstrated (r = 0.66, p = 0.01). However, anomalous results obtained with three products (sufu, tempeh, and fully hydrolyzed isolated soy protein) did not make it possible to reach firm conclusions concerning the effect of the protein fraction of soy on iron bioavailability.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of the patient populations accepted for and undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Europe in 1980 to 1987 are presented. Acceptance rates have increased in most countries reporting to the EDTA Registry and have reached from between 50 to over 80 per million population in the more affluent Western European countries in 1987. Increasing acceptance rates were due to the inclusion of patient groups at a higher risk of dying, such as the elderly and those with diabetic nephropathy. Despite the acceptance of a growing proportion of high-risk patients, no increase in overall mortality was apparent. Gross mortality (some 10% annually) changed little between 1980 and 1987 for patients on hemodialysis, decreased sharply from 1980 to 1984 for patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and improved continuously from 4.2% in 1980 to 2.4% in 1987 for patients with a functioning kidney graft. In order to determine mortality more accurately, actuarial survival rates and annual death rates per thousand patient years at risk were computed according to age groups and to primary renal disease groups, both for the total patient data file and for selected countries. Actuarial 5-year survival on hemodialysis for all patients starting treatment between 1982 and 1987 varied according to age, being 84% in patients age 15 to 24 years and 20% in those age 75 to 84 years. Patients with \"standard\" primary renal diseases had slightly better survival, while of the group with diabetic nephropathy only 51% age 25 to 34 and no more than 3% of those age 75 to 84 survived the 5-year mark. To recognize trends in the mortality between 1980 and 1987, annual death rates for all patients on record, age 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 at the beginning of 1980, 1983, 1985, and 1987 were computed both for the total Registry and for the FRG. Despite an increasing acceptance rate of patients with diabetic nephropathy, the annual death rates on hemodialysis decreased or remained stable both for the total Registry and for the FRG. Death rates in patients with a functioning graft decreased. It is concluded that, during the last decade, survival on RRT has continued to improve not only because of decreasing mortality after transplantation and on CAPD, but also due to improving survival on hemodialysis. The latter is not readily apparent because of the increasing acceptance rate in older patient groups and a rapidly rising proportion of patients with diabetic nephropathy in most European countries.\r"

There was an increase in the rate of acceptance of new patients between 1982 and 1987. The largest increases were in the older age groups, and resulted in a concomitant increase in the number of registered patients in older age groups. Survival on dialysis by age group declined with age. There was no difference in patient survival on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The probability of death for all patients entering the ESRF system remained constant notwithstanding year of entry into the system. It was slightly higher for males than females, much higher for patients with diabetes or renal vascular disease, higher with age, and much higher for patients not undergoing transplant.\r"

  ".U": "90240207\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of new dialysis-dependent patients in Australia increased rapidly from 1982, due mainly to acceptance for treatment of more elderly patients. In 1988, 21% of patients beginning dialysis were 65 to 74 years old, and a further 26% were 55 to 64 years. Consequently, the prevalence of dialysis-dependent patients increased considerably during the same period, particularly in the age range 55 to 74 years. Diabetes-induced renal failure accounted for a constant low proportion of new patients, approximately 10%, which contrasted with the experience in some other countries. Hemodialysis (HD) was the more common method of treatment compared with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 1988 (70% v 30%, respectively). Home dialysis treatment, HD or CAPD, supported 50% of all dialysis-dependent patients. Patient survival at 1, 2, and 5 years after initiating treatment was 89%, 78%, and 48%, respectively. Age and method of dialysis significantly influenced survival; the elderly and diabetic had a lower expectation of survival. The difference in survival of HD compared with CAPD increased with the duration of treatment, reaching 20% at 5 years (5-year survival, 59% HD; 39% CAPD). There was no evidence of increasing mortality among patients beginning treatment recently. Withdrawal from treatment represented 16% of deaths during 1988; 19% of the deaths were in the age group 65 to 74 years. The influence of the morbidity and mortality of dialysis on provision of such treatment for end-stage renal failure in the elderly population warrants an objective review of both the benefits to the individual and the availability of health care to the whole society.\r"

  ".U": "90240210\r", 
  ".W": "Patient survival on hemodialysis has previously been shown to be associated with the presence of comorbid conditions on entrance. Significant comorbid conditions are atherosclerotic heart disease (ASHD), cerebral vascular disease (CVD), nonskin malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and age on entrance to dialysis. Changes in annual mortality have been noted in the United States and at the Regional Kidney Disease Program. The increase in annual mortality was analyzed to determine the impact of risk factors during the time intervals 1976 to 1982 and 1983 to 1987. Patients with no major risk factors have longer survival rates and lower deaths per 1,000 treatment-months from 1983 to 1987 compared with 1976 to 1982. Diabetics have survival rates and deaths per 1,000 treatment-months that are comparable up to age 75. However, over age 75, diabetics have lower survival rates and higher death rates. The presence of comorbid conditions in the diabetic group is high and may account for the increased death rate. The percent of diabetics entering the program has increased from 29% to 48% over the intervals. Nondiabetics with comorbid conditions on entrance had higher deaths per 1,000 treatment-months from 1983 to 1987 compared with 1976 to 1982 across all age categories. Risk factor analysis shows that nondiabetics with major risks are entering with increasing numbers and continuation of comorbid conditions that impact death rates. Peripheral vascular disease, originally not significantly associated with death on dialysis, has dramatically increased from 18% to 60% in nondiabetics with comorbid conditions. In the patients over age 60 with comorbid conditions, 75% of patients now entering dialysis have peripheral vascular disease (PVD). In summary, major shifts in the hemodialysis population have occurred. Diabetics entering dialysis now account for almost 50% of all patients, with the older group having more comorbid conditions. This change alone would increase the annual mortality rate. Patients with comorbid conditions now enter with a higher prevalence of multiple comorbid conditions, which would increase the annual mortality rate. Nondiabetics without comorbid conditions now have better survival across all age categories compared with the previous data. PVD, with its current high prevalence, needs to be reevaluated as a significant risk factor for death on hemodialysis. Therefore, the increase in the annual gross mortality rate is highly predicted based on the change in the diabetic population and the increase in single and multiple comorbid conditions in the nondiabetic population.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the impact of the Medicare price for outpatient maintenance dialysis on the level and composition of staffing of dialysis units, and on the length (duration) of the average hemodialysis treatment for the period 1982 to 1987. With higher prices, dialysis units employ more total staff hours per patient per week (P less than 0.01) and use a higher proportion of registered nurses (RN) compared with other staff such as technicians and licensed practical nurses (LPN). Higher Medicare prices are also associated with longer average hemodialysis treatment duration for freestanding units (P less than 0.02), but there was no statistically significant association for hospital units. The impact of the Medicare price on both staffing and average treatment duration takes into account the calendar time trend, ie, 1987 versus 1982, which has a separate impact from the price effect. For example, to avoid the complication of technology changes over calendar time, we considered the impact of the price change at one point in time. Freestanding units that had a price cut of more than +15 in 1983, reported twice the reduction in the average dialysis treatment duration (-0.38 hours) compared with -0.20 hours (P = 0.01) for units that had a cut of less than +15. An analysis of the impact of average treatment duration on patient mortality provided some evidence that shorter treatment duration in freestanding units is associated with higher mortality. This result needs further analysis. There was no statistically significant relationship between the level of staffing in the dialysis unit or the percent of staff who were RNs and 3-year patient survival. The analysis in this report was based on 1,213 and 1,058 data forms filed with Medicare by freestanding and hospital units, respectively, for 1982 and 1987. In addition, we used a Cox proportional hazards model (multivariate) for the analysis of the 3-year patient survival for 14,807 new hemodialysis patients who started dialysis in 1984.\r"

Given these large samples that approach a census in each of the three regions, all results are statistically significant. Our analysis showed that the US patients were older and more likely to be diabetic than the patients in either EDTA or Japan. After correction for patient differences in age composition and the percent diabetic, Japan had the highest survival, followed by EDTA, and then the US. Overall, the US 5-year survival was 40%. When comparison is done by age, only the youngest patients in the US (less than 15 years) have longer survival than their counterparts in Europe and Japan. For ages greater than 14 years, the survival differences between the US and EDTA and between the US and Japan grow larger with higher patient age. The comparisons of mortality by diagnosis showed that the differences between the US and EDTA and between the US and Japan were least for diabetes. For non-diabetic patients, the age adjusted relative risk (RR) of mortality for the US compared with EDTA was 1.22, ie, 22% higher in the US; for the US compared with Japan, the RR was 1.40. In contrast, the RR for diabetic patients in the US compared with EDTA was 1.07, and 1.23 for the US compared with Japan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Logistic regression analysis was applied to a sample of more than 12,000 hemodialysis patients to evaluate the association of various patient descriptors, treatment time (hours/treatment), and various laboratory tests with the probability of death. Advancing age, white race, and diabetes were all associated with a significantly increased risk of death. Short dialysis times were also associated with high death risk before adjustment for the value of laboratory tests. Of the laboratory variables, low serum albumin less than 40 g/L (less than 4.0 g/dL) was most highly associated with death probability. About two thirds of patients had low albumin. These findings suggest that inadequate nutrition may be an important contributing factor to the mortality suffered by hemodialysis patients. The relative risk profiles for other laboratory tests are presented. Among these, low serum creatinine, not high, was associated with high death risk. Both serum albumin concentration and creatinine were directly correlated with treatment time so that high values for both substances were associated with long treatment times. The data suggest that physicians may select patients with high creatinine for more intense dialysis exposure and patients with low creatinine for less intense treatment. In a separate analysis, observed death rates were compared with rates expected on the basis of case mix for these 237 facilities. The data suggest substantial volatility of observed/expected ratios when facility size is small. Nonetheless, a minority of facilities (less than or equal to 2%) may have higher rates than expected when compared with the pool of all patients in this sample. The effect of various laboratory variables on mortality is substantial, while relatively few facilities have observed death rates that exceed their expected values. Therefore, we suggest that strategies designed to improve the overall mortality statistic for dialysis patients in the United States would be better directed toward improving the quality of care for all patients, particularly high-risk patients, within their usual treatment settings rather than trying to identify facilities with high death rate for possible regulatory intervention.\r"

We also studied cause of death, outcome, and cumulative survival and tried to relate them to changes in patients and procedures. Finally, we studied how cumulative survival of dialysis patients was dependent on acceptance rates and transplant rates in five European regions and the United States. At both centers, the number of patients accepted grew, but since 1980, the only patient group that has increased has been older patients with many other diseases; these comorbid conditions have increased from approximately 1.2 to 1.4. In both centers, the number of patients with systemic disease, diabetes, and nephrosclerosis doubled. Cause of death showed a decrease in cardiovascular deaths and an increase in deaths due to stopping dialysis. The hemoglobin level increased from 70 to 90 g/L (7.0 to 9.0 g/dL) and the diastolic blood pressure decreased from 100 to 90 mmHg. The creatinine level decreased 30%, with an unchanged urea. Cumulative 3-year survival for patients without complications increased from 60% to approximately 90% and in patients with complications, it improved from 20% to 60% in Sweden and remained at approximately 60% in the US center. In the United States, many more patients were accepted to dialysis and the transplant rate was high. Cumulative survival on dialysis was inversely correlated both to the acceptance rates to dialysis and to the percent of patients transplanted. These factors explained over 90% of the differences in dialysis survival.\r"

The usual HD prescription is three dialysis periods weekly, hollow-fiber dialyzer, 1.0-1.2 m2 surface area, for 4 to 5 hours, with blood flow rate 250 mL/min and acetate-based dialysate flow rate 500 mL/min. Reuse of the dialyzer is common, but many units practice single use to reduce the expense and time necessary for processing the dialyzer and the risks of formalin exposure. There is only limited use of hemofiltration, or highly efficient dialyzers for shortened hours at higher blood flow rates. The choice of dialysis prescription is influenced by the physician's preference for the patient to be treated at home or in a self-care center with limited assistance. CAPD is preferred for home dialysis, especially for elderly or diabetic patients. There is no personal financial incentive to the physician to favor any particular form of dialysis. The costs of dialysis do influence the provision and prescription of treatment, causing the reuse of dialyzers and the limited use of bicarbonate-based HD and highly permeable dialyzers. Nevertheless, adequate dialysis should be available to all patients, and noncompliance with prescribed dialysis is infrequent. Quality-assurance programs have been developed both for nursing and medical care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the extent to which dialysis prescription is achieved in the United States and the reasons for failure to do so. Dialysis treatment data (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], duration [T], and dialyzer urea clearance [K]), for 297 patients treated in 48 dialysis units in the United States were used to calculate the urea kinetic modeling parameter, V (urea distribution). V was also calculated for 5,650 treatments of 357 patients in five representative units starting or continuing to kinetically model patients monthly over the past 2 years. V was estimated in patients from height, weight, and sex (Vest). If V differed from Vest by 20% or more, we concluded that a decrease in BUN was inconsistent with expected therapy and represented \"nondelivery\" of dialysis (ie, KT is decreased by approximately 20% or more). Half the US units studied had more than 35% nondelivery of therapy; more than 50% of treatments were not delivered in 44% of the units. The reasons for nondelivery could not be determined directly in the US study because we had limited contact with their dialysis programs. Common causes are treatment delivery errors (K and T), access problems, recirculation due to rapid blood flow, and dialyzers that deviate from the manufacturers' specifications. The long-term (five-unit) study showed the same percent of nondelivery of dialysis in start-up units as in the US study (40% to 50%). Long-term, nondelivery decreases to 10% to 20% in these units. For these units, nondelivery tends to occur for the same patients month to month; a decrease in nondelivery of treatment from start-up to lower long-term levels is due to more deliberate delivery of dialysis therapy. The persistence of a 10% to 20% shortfall in therapy stems from either access or clotting problems, many of which cannot be corrected. We conclude that widespread nondelivery of dialysis exists in US dialysis facilities and probably world-wide. If optimal (minimal) dialysis prescription is the therapy goal of a dialysis unit, the deliberate delivery of the desired treatment should be routinely checked using quantitative assessment techniques such as urea kinetic modeling. If this is not done, optimal treatment may not be achieved and inadequate treatment may result.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports indicate increasing mortality correlated to reduced treatment time (t) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. HD prescriptions for 101 patients visiting our unit were subjected to kinetic analysis to assess the amount of dialysis prescribed (Kt/V) and its relationship to t. The analysis showed (1) 98% of the prescriptions were empirical; (2) Kt/V was strongly correlated to protein intake (normalized protein catabolic rate [NPCR], g/kg/d), r = 0.50, N = 101; (3) Kt/V was strongly correlated to t, y = 0.50 + 0.54x, r = 0.54, and fell below 1 when t less than or equal to 3.5 hours; (4) a prescription flux deficit appeared and increased exponentially as t fell below 3.7 hours. These results suggest that in clinical practice, t is individualized as a function of predialysis BUN and is reduced when BUN is low due to low NPCR because of a perceived need for less dialysis. Because of this practice, reduced t is often associated with inadequate dialysis, and kinetic modeling of the interrelationship between blood urea nitrogen (BUN), NPCR, and Kt/V is required to assure adequate dialysis with reduced t.\r"

After seven weeks of a daily dose, tolerance reduced the response to betaxolol to insignificant levels and that to phenylephrine substantially, whereas timolol maleate continued to produce identical levels of vasoconstriction to those seen with single-dose administration. In addition to the consequent lowering of perfusion of the ciliary processes and presumptive impact on aqueous humor production, vasoconstriction also reinforces concerns about impaired vascular perfusion of eyes undergoing long-term ocular therapy.\r"

The 20 patients were a homogeneous group that was typified by older age distribution (average, 73 years), a preponderance of hyperopia (median refraction, +2.15 diopters spherical equivalent), female gender (19 women, one man), no iris transillumination defects (zero of 38 eyes), and flatter iris insertion into the ciliary body.

Six of the eight eyes also had visual improvement. In six of 14 eyes (43%), the neovascular membrane eventually progressed into the fovea with resultant visual loss.

In a monocular patient, exfoliation and pigmentary dispersion were concurrently present with characteristic defects of both pigmentary dispersion and exfoliation as seen by transillumination defects of the iris. A third patient had bilateral pigmentary dispersion and uncontrollable intraocular pressure in an eye with exfoliation. Despite argon laser trabeculoplasty, the pressure remained uncontrolled. Another patient had a filtering operation in the left eye, with gradually increasing intraocular pressure in the right eye. Exfoliation material complicated the pressure control in the unoperated on eye. Another patient had an eight-year history of glaucoma in the left eye for which filtering surgery was performed. Exfoliation was present in both eyes with controlled pressure in the filtered eye but uncontrolled pressure in the nonfiltered eye.\r"

Four distinct categories of macroaneurysms included arterial, venous, capillary, and collateral-associated types. We identified 59 lesions among 25 of the 154 (16.2%) affected eyes. Intraretinal lipid exudation and hemorrhage were commonly observed around the lesions, but these complications usually did not affect visual acuity.

Cataract extraction improved the vision in seven of nine eyes. Previous or simultaneous sclerotomy or sclerectomy was performed on all nine eyes that underwent cataract extraction and in two eyes at the time of glaucoma surgery; no eye had postoperative uveal effusion or other major complications. Laser iridotomy and iridoplasty, sometimes with supplemental medical therapy, are often sufficient in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma in nanophthalmos and are safer than surgery.

In other oculoplastic procedures, ten of the 18 patients underwent surgery with the scalpel Nd:YAG laser on one side and conventional surgery on the other side. There was less bleeding, a shorter operating time, and less pain on removal of orbital fat on the laser-treated side. The postoperative scarring was initially more noticeable on the Nd:YAG laser-treated side, but after three months there was no appreciable difference in scar formation between the two sides. The amount of postoperative edema and ecchymosis did not appear to be significantly different with the Nd:YAG laser compared with conventional surgery. Additionally, microscopic evaluation showed minimal charring of tissues with the Nd:YAG laser.\r"

Tumor size, location of the anterior margin of the tumor, and patient age at the time of treatment were identified as simultaneous significant clinical variables for predicting melanoma-specific mortality by multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling. We computed a prognostic index for each patient based on this model and found that patients in the enucleation group had slightly higher values of this index than did patients in the cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy group. Risk ratios for the treatment effect computed from a Cox model incorporating prognostic index and the treatment variable were found to be approximately equal to 1, both for analysis of melanoma-specific mortality and total mortality. These results indicate that when one controls for differences in prognostic index between the groups, cobalt-60 plaque therapy and enucleation are essentially equivalent in their effect on survival.\r"

An antecedent history of trauma at the tumor site was elicited from 28% of patients. Thirty-one of 32 primary tumors were completely excised at initial presentation. Five tumors were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. The overall recurrence rate for primary and recurrent lesions was 60%. The recurrence rate in children (88%) was more than twice that found in adults (38%). A single recurrence did not significantly increase the likelihood of a subsequent recurrence. Greater than 90% of all recurrences took place within 3 years of treatment. The rate of recurrence was not clearly influenced by the status of histologic margins, although this was examined in less than half the tumors. Desmoid tumors are aggressive neoplasms that exhibit a strong propensity for local recurrence. They should be treated as low-grade malignancies with documentation of histologic margins and close clinical follow-up within the framework of a tumor registry.\r"

Moderately injured patients required less time (under 25 minutes). Patients needing emergent operations spent a minimal amount of time (20 minutes) in TR. Potential injuries involving the airway or cervical spine, or shock, added minutes. A review of the timing and organization of TR suggests the need for improvement in airway assessment and management. Patients with certain mechanisms of injury and elderly patients with blunt injuries required additional time in TR. With surgery faculty supervision and senior resident attendance, the month of resident experience had no effect on TR times. A timely and organized TR is critical to trauma care. TR times should be documented for quality assurance and ongoing review.\r"

  ".W": "To determine patient demographics, referral patterns, and problems with trauma transfer, records of 412 patients received over a 1-year period at the Vancouver General Hospital, a Level I Trauma Center, were reviewed. The average Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 15 (range: 1 to 75), with 142 patients (34%) having an ISS of 16 or greater. One hundred ninety-six (47%) of the transfers were accomplished by fixed-wing aircraft, 15 (4%) by helicopter, and 201 (49%) by land. Seventy-two percent were transported within 24 hours of injury. The injury mechanisms were as follows: 193 (47%) vehicular, 108 (26%) falls, 50 (12%) penetrating, 43 (10%) thermal, and 18 (5%) assaults/crush. Transfer was prompted by musculo-skeletal injuries in 157 (38%), neurosurgical problems in 71 (17%), multiple injuries in 64 (16%), burns in 45 (11%), hand injuries in 27 (7%), facial injuries in 26 (6%), and other problems in 22 (5%). Transfer management problems included airway in 4 patients, respiratory care in 8, and hemodynamic instability in 10. Only two of these patients had an ISS less than 16. Although most transfers were appropriate, some could have been avoided by more careful physician screening. For example, of six patients referred for digit replantation, only one was a suitable candidate. Lack of adequate regional care resulted in 10 long-distance air transports for isolated hip fractures. It is concluded that the majority of transfers were indicated and were safely carried out. However, there is a need for better patient screening, regionalized service, and improved communication regarding appropriate stabilization prior to transfer, particularly for patients with serious injuries.\r"

Perioperative mortality was 14% during the most recent 7-year interval, which was a notable improvement compared with the earlier time interval (p = 0.06). Extended follow-up of the perioperative survivors demonstrated a 77% cumulative 5-year survival and a 76% cumulative 5-year limb salvage rate. Subsequent axillofemoral graft infection occurred in 22% of survivors and resulted in a significantly higher amputation rate compared with those patients with no axillofemoral graft infection (p less than 0.001). The results suggest good perioperative and long-term survival in patients with aortic graft infection, with excellent limb salvage if subsequent axillofemoral graft infection can be avoided.\r"

The program was carefully planned by a group consisting of representatives of all appropriate constituents. The screenees have demonstrated the anticipated increased frequency with increasing age and risk factors; in addition, the frequency of diagnosis is markedly lower in screenees who have had mammograms within the 2 previous years. Exclusive of equipment costs, amortization, and data processing, the cost per study is $33.81 (Canadian), resulting in a cost of $8,277.62 for each case diagnosed. This includes, for each study, an administrative fee of $1.00 as well as $1.00 devoted to continuing education for the reading radiologists. The success of the program has resulted in encouragement from the Health Ministry to expand rapidly throughout the Province, including use of a mobile van in more remote areas. Continued monitoring and peer review will ensure standard quality control in all of the screening facilities.\r"

There was a direct dose-dependent relationship between mitogenic activity and increased risk of developing breast cancer. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that breast cyst fluid from women at highest risk contained two peaks of growth factor activity: less than 6 kilodaltons (kd), identified as human EGF (epidermal growth factor), and 6 to 18 kd. Moderate-risk group samples demonstrated only the single less than 6 kd peak, whereas the lowest-risk group had insignificant growth-promoting activity. Breast cancer tissue analyzed in a similar manner revealed a predominant 6- to 14-kd peak of mitogenic activity demonstrating the same acid- and heat-stability found in breast cyst fluid.\r"

Thirteen of 35 patients had a family history of breast cancer, with 11 patients having an affected first-degree relative. This is significantly increased over other series of breast cancer patients. Recurrence was ipsilateral in all patients and occurred at the site of the original disease. Recurrence occurred in 4 of 30 patients treated with local resection only and 2 of 8 treated with local resection plus radiotherapy. The length of mean follow-up was 39 months. Because of the paucity of studies, these results cannot be compared with others, but there does appear to be a significant incidence of local recurrence after resection for comedo-type DCIS. Immunohistochemical and oncogene studies as they relate to comedo-type DCIS are discussed.\r"

Of the remaining 165, 148 (90%) were followed up with either surgery or clinical follow-up of at least 12 months' duration. Seventy-one of these aspirates were malignant. Fifty-six cases of metastatic carcinoma and 13 cases of lymphoma were diagnosed. The positive predictive value for metastatic carcinoma and lymphoma was 100%, and the sensitivities were 92% and 100%, respectively. For benign salivary gland lesions, the positive predictive value was 94%, whereas for malignant lesions it was 100%. One case of carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma was missed by FNA. No complications were associated with FNA. We conclude that FNA is a safe and accurate technique, well suited to the in-office evaluation of neck masses of differing causes.\r"

After a standard 5-minute scrub, one hand was randomly rinsed prior to gloving; the other was lightly patted with a sterile towel, leaving some foam on the hand. The surgeon then gloved and performed the procedure in the usual manner. After the operation, both hands were immersed in a tryptic soy broth for 30 seconds. The broth was then cultured for bacterial species and number. Cases in which glove puncture occurred were not cultured. The results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. There were fewer bacterial colonies isolated from the hand coated with chlorhexidine scrub versus the other; this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.005). There also seemed to be a trend towards higher bacterial counts after longer operations; however, the difference was not significant. Neither surgeon noted any evidence of dermatitis during the study. These results suggest that leaving chlorhexidine scrub on the hands during surgery can lead to lower bacterial counts on the surgeon's hands and less chance of wound contamination should glove puncture occur.\r"

When significant liver dysfunction appears, early transfer to a liver transplant center is important to identify appropriate candidates and to begin the search for a donor organ. The clinical course of five severely poisoned patients, four of whom underwent liver transplantation, is reviewed. Indications for transplantation included primarily a markedly prolonged prothrombin time that was only partially correctable and a constellation of findings including metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and increased serum ammonia, following a marked elevation in serum aminotransferase levels. Unlike viral fulminant hepatic failure, grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy, marked elevation of the serum bilirubin level, and azotemia were not indications for transplantation. Resected livers demonstrated hepatocyte viability of 0% to 30%. Manifestations of Amanita poisoning complicating preoperative and/or postoperative care included severe diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hypophosphatemia, bowel edema, and marrow suppression with lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. All five patients are well 1 year later. This largest experience with liver transplantation for Amanita poisoning further defines the early clinical and laboratory indications for, and the unique complicating features of, transplantation in this setting.\r"

Although increasing numbers of patients with ruptured aortas are surviving to reach the hospital, the in-hospital mortality attending this injury remains high. Death due to transected aorta has been related to a delay in diagnosis. In an attempt to decrease the time necessary for diagnosis of this injury, we studied 50 patients using intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) and conventional biplane angiography. We found that IVDSA was significantly faster than conventional biplane angiography, and that when IVDSA films are of diagnostic quality, they are sufficient to reliably demonstrate the presence of traumatic aortic transection. Our study was too small to establish whether IVDSA is a sufficiently sensitive test to exclude aortic injury. Further studies in this area need to be performed.\r"

The outcome of 203 patients undergoing technetium 99m-labeled red cell scintigraphy was reviewed, and the scan result was compared with the true site of bleeding. The true site of bleeding was determined by other methods including angiography and surgical pathology. Fifty-two scans (26%) were positive and indicated a specific site of bleeding. A definitive bleeding site was identified in 22 patients by other means and correlated with the technetium scan in only 9 cases. The nuclear scan was incorrect in the remaining 13 cases, implying a localization error of 25% (13 of 52). A subgroup of 19 patients with a positive scan underwent a surgical procedure directed by the nuclear scan. Eight of these 12 patients had incorrect surgical procedures based upon findings of more definitive tests, indicating a surgical error of 42% (8 of 19). We conclude that the technetium 99m-labeled red cell scan's ability to accurately localize the site of lower gastrointestinal bleeding is limited. Furthermore, performing a surgical procedure that relies exclusively on localization by red cell scintigraphy will produce an undesirable result in at least 42% of patients.\r"

A 5-year review of NEC at Children's Hospital and Medical Center identified the unique features of this disease in the term neonate. Eighty-one patients with NEC were treated between January 1984 and May 1989. Ten full-term neonates with gestational age greater than 38 weeks were identified for study. Charts were reviewed for recognized risk factors, clinical course, surgical intervention, and outcome. Ninety percent had a birth weight greater than or equal to 2.7 kg, and all were above 2.1 kg. NEC developed early in this group, with onset of disease in the first 48 hours of life in 50% of the group and within the first 4 days of life in 90%. The recognized risk factors of asphyxia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and respiratory distress were absent in 60%. Seven of 10 patients required exploratory laparotomy, whereas 3 of 10 required only medical treatment. Indications for operation were perforation in three patients, peritonitis in three patients, and mass in one patient. All patients requiring operations had severe colonic disease, with perforation of the colon in five of seven and full-thickness necrosis without perforation in two of seven. Two patients required total abdominal colectomy. Only one patient with perforated meconium ileus and associated NEC had small bowel involvement. This patient was the only mortality of the group. Subsequent intestinal continuity was restored in all surviving patients with no late complications. Two patients required resection of additional NEC strictures prior to reanastomosis. Of the three medically treated patients, none required subsequent operation for colonic stricture. Our experience indicates that the presentation, clinical course, and operative findings in full-term neonates with NEC differ from those encountered in the premature infant with NEC.\r"

Diverticulitis (41%), Crohn's disease (17%), and colorectal cancer (16%) were the major causes. In 50 of 51 patients, the diagnosis was made on the basis of the clinical history and the urine culture. Radiologic and endoscopic studies failed to identify the fistula in 20%, though all were confirmed at operation or autopsy. In four of eight patients with fistulas secondary to colorectal cancer, malignancy was not diagnosed preoperatively. Operation was performed in 84% of the patients. One-stage resection of the bowel was performed in 66% of patients with the intent of removing the fistula. The complication rate was 8% with no deaths. All multi-stage procedures were performed for fistulas complicated by abscess or bowel obstruction. There were two postoperative deaths in patients with metastatic cancer undergoing palliative diversion. All eight patients treated by diverting colostomy had persistent fistulas and urinary sepsis. All eight patients treated with antibiotics but without operation were free of complications of the fistula until death from other causes. Enterovesical fistula is a clinical diagnosis. Preoperative studies should be used to delineate the bowel disease and search for malignancy rather than to see the fistula, which is clinically apparent. One-stage resection of the involved bowel is the procedure of choice in the absence of abscess or bowel obstruction. When resection is not feasible, medical management with antibiotics is preferable to colostomy.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominoperineal resection (APR) has been the treatment of choice for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus; however, chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (CT-RT) has now replaced APR as the primary treatment. Since 1983, 17 patients with carcinoma of the anus have been treated at Wenatchee Valley Clinic Tumor Center. Fourteen of these patients were treated with radiotherapy concurrently with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C. Local control at 6 weeks post-treatment occurred in all 14 patients. Four of the 14 patients treated with CT-RT died, 2 of recurrent cloacogenic carcinoma, 2 of other cancers, and 1 of deep vein thrombosis. Five patients with stage III cancer were free of obvious disease at an average of 27 months follow-up. CT-RT seems to be successful for local control of anal carcinoma and, based on other studies, provides improvement in long-term survival when compared with APR.\r"

  ".W": "In order to eliminate homologous blood transfusions during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, increased usage of autologous predonation and intraoperative salvage is required. To determine what quantity of predonated blood is necessary to completely avoid the use of homologous blood, we reviewed the transfusion histories of 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective AAA repairs. A total of 445 units of blood were transfused, and the number of units required was directly proportional to the size of the aneurysm. One hundred sixty-six units of blood (37%) were homologous, and 279 units (63%) were autologous. Of the autologous units, 255 (91%) were from intraoperative salvage and 24 (9%) were predonated. Stratification of transfusions by size revealed that for aneurysms less than or equal to 7 cm, 132 units of homologous and 21 units of predonated blood were transfused (1.55 units per patient and 0.25 units per patient, respectively). For aneurysms greater than 7 cm, 34 units of homologous and 3 units of predonated blood were used (2.3 units per patient and 0.2 units per patient, respectively). From these data, it is concluded that predonation before surgery of a minimum of 2 units for patients with smaller aneurysms and 3 units for patients with larger aneurysms, combined with intraoperative salvage, should eliminate the need for any homologous blood transfusions associated with elective AAA repair.\r"

Over a 5-year period, we identified four patients who developed dense hemiparesis in the recovery room postoperatively. A fifth patient with a similar problem after carotid subclavian bypass was included for analysis. All patients were found to have thrombosis of the operated vessel. Direct closure had been used after endarterectomy. All vessels were thrombectomized and patched with autogenous vein. Interposition graft was used in the patient who underwent carotid subclavian bypass. There were no deaths, and only one patient did not improve. Our experience encourages us to continue this practice but also suggests that the frequency of this problem may be reduced further by patch angioplasty.\r"

Our experience with the management of these patients forms the basis of this report. All patients were men, with a mean age of 29 years, and all experienced repetitive trauma to the involved upper extremity. Each patient presented with the acute onset of cool and painful digits, with no previous history of cold sensitivity or Raynaud's syndrome. None of the patients had any serologic or clinical evidence of autoimmune disease. Angiography revealed occlusion of the ulnar artery on the affected side in two patients and patent ulnar artery aneurysms in the remaining five patients. There was occlusion of multiple common and proper digital arteries in all patients. One patient with bilateral ulnar artery aneurysms underwent operative repair consisting of aneurysm excision and replacement with autogenous vein grafts from the lower extremity. All patients have improved symptoms, and the grafts remained patent over a mean follow-up of 24 months (range: 13 to 57 months). Based on these results, we recommend that excision and grafting be considered for patients with symptomatic patent ulnar artery aneurysms. Selected patients with thrombosed aneurysms with ongoing digital ischemia may also benefit from surgical intervention.\r"

The plasma concentration-time curves fitted a two-compartment model. The elimination half-life was between 0.9 and 1.4 hours, volume of central compartment between 0.95 and 2.10 litres/kg, volume of distribution between 3.75 and 5.58 litres/kg and total body clearance between 1.80 and 3.07 (litres/hour)/kg. The excretion in urine of unchanged pregnanolone was less than 0.1%. The pharmacodynamic properties were found to be similar to those of Althesin, with immediate induction of anaesthesia of short duration. The anaesthetic affected haemodynamics only slightly; minor depression of ventilation, with an increase in PaCO2, occurred in several of the subjects. Excitation of short duration occurred in one subject during induction of sleep and slight involuntary muscle movements in another subject during sleep. It is impossible to draw any clear conclusions of the clinical efficacy and tolerance from this limited normal subject trial, but pregnanolone emulsion seems worthy of further clinical trial.\r"

The system was used to provide general anaesthesia for 33 healthy patients who underwent general surgery. A strong statistical relationship was found between measured blood propofol concentrations and the corresponding computer predictions (y = -0.50 + 1.36x). No significant differences in this relationship were found between patients who breathed spontaneously (y = -0.71x + 1.43x) and those who received intermittent positive pressure ventilation (y = -0.33 + 1.32x).\r"

The overall incidence of hypotension was 60%, when temperature sensation was blocked to T7 and above (n = 25). The number of patients with hypotension which required treatment increased as block height increased above T7; at a level of T4 or higher, all patients required ephedrine.

Nine patients were identified from 1956 to 1988; their average age was 41 years. Common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, tenesmus, small caliber stools, abdominal distention, and blood per rectum. Bowel symptoms were cyclic in four of the nine patients, and seven had a history of gynecologic complaints. Barium enema was performed in six patients and endoscopy in five patients. All cases involved the sigmoid or rectosigmoid colon. In no case was the diagnosis established endoscopically. Surgical procedures included resection with primary anastomosis (6 patients), and resection with sigmoid endcolostomy and Hartmann's pouch (3 patients). In only one case was full-thickness colonic wall involvement noted. One patient had an adenocarcinoma of the colon adjacent to the area of endometriosis. Our data indicate that the diagnosis of endometriosis of the colon should be considered in women with colonic symptoms, especially with an associated history of dysmenorrhea or cyclic changes in bowel habits. Surgical resection offers the best chance for relief of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 109 patients with perforated peptic ulcer revealed a sex ratio of 60:49, male:female, with mean age of 67 (76 patients greater than or equal to age 50). Peritoneal cultures were positive in 52 per cent, with the most common organisms streptococci and fungi. Subsequent infectious morbidity with these organisms was rare. Postoperative respiratory and renal failure were associated with intraoperative hypotension (systolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg). Mortality was associated with age greater than 55 and intraoperative hypotension. We conclude that in the 1980s perforated peptic ulcer occurs most frequently in older patients and that acid stomach contents does not ensure sterility, yet subsequent infectious morbidity is rare. Intraoperative hypotension, which occurs especially in patients greater than 55 years, results in significant morbidity and mortality. Attention to preoperative and intraoperative resuscitation is the single most effective therapy for reducing morbidity and mortality from this disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the records of 1,982 patients who were treated for head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer from 1962 to 1986. Forty-one patients had primary cancer at both sites. Twenty-one cases of these multiple primaries occurred synchronously and twenty were metachronous. The overall incidence of esophageal cancer in our head- and neck-cancer patients was 2.5 per cent and the incidence of head and neck cancer in our esophageal cancer patients was 7.1 per cent. From 1980 to 1986, 574 cases with a diagnosis of head and neck or esophageal cancer were routinely screened for other aerodigestive malignancies at the time of initial diagnosis. From this group, only six patients had simultaneous lesions of the head and neck and esophagus with only one asymptomatic esophageal carcinoma. Median survival of all 41 multiple primary patients after diagnosis of esophageal cancer was 5.3 months. Two- and three-year survivals were 6.7 per cent and 0 per cent, respectively. There was no significant survival difference for lesions diagnosed simultaneously, synchronously, and metachronously before 1980 or after 1980. All patients died with uncontrolled esophageal cancer except for one patient who died of head- and neck-cancer recurrence. Our experience indicates that active screening of head- and neck-cancer patients for simultaneous esophageal cancer has a low yield and there appears to be no survival advantage for these patients compared with those with subsequently diagnosed esophageal tumors.\r"

Angiodysplasia can be difficult to diagnose, thereby complicating management as well. In the past, the diagnosis of angiodysplasia was rarely made early and rested upon a high index of suspicion in patients with lower GI bleeding and multiple negative diagnostic evaluations. Consequently, surgery was often performed late with increased morbidity and high recurrence rates. With the advent of pre- and intraoperative selective angiography, these vascular malformations are readily demonstrated in most cases and will often respond to conservative interventional radiologic procedures. Failing this, angiographic localization has made segmental resection both safe and quite accurate, thus obviating extensive, blind excision.\r"

In patients who require adjuvant radiotherapy, such loops of intestine fixed in the pelvis may predispose the patient to radiation enteritis. Proposed methods to prevent such fixed loops of small intestine in the pelvis include closure of the pelvic peritoneum with subperitoneal drainage, fixation of the bladder to the sacrum, retroversion of the uterus, placement of prosthetic mesh, and placement of an omental pedicle graft in the pelvic hollow. The omental pedicle graft has the advantages of ease of performance, use of autologous tissue, and filling the pelvic hollow with vascularized tissue, which should decrease the risk of postoperative pelvic abscess. This study reviews the technique of omental pedicle graft closure of the pelvis and the results of it in our initial eight patients. The omental pedicle graft has become the preferred method of pelvic reconstruction following abdominoperineal resection at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.\r"

The major morbidity results from intussusception, obstruction, and bleeding. Standard surgical management has been to perform enterotomies at the site of palpable polyps. A method of treating Peutz-Jeghers syndrome surgically with combined intraoperative enteroscopy is presented. The patient had eight large polyps that required three enterotomies for removal. Only three of the polyps were palpable. Two intussusceptions were reduced. The advantages of intraoperative enteroscopy are that 1) it provides accurate assessment of the extent of the disease, 2) smaller polyps can be treated endoscopically, preventing enterotomies, and 3) the endoscopist can direct the surgeon to the appropriate enterotomy sites. A combined surgical and endoscopic approach for the management of Peutz-Jeghers is successful. It more accurately removes the cause of the major morbidity associated with the disease and may allow the patient a longer interval between laparotomies.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded, dose escalation as needed. SETTING: Four university medical centers; patients referred for treatment. PATIENTS: Twenty-six hyperprolactinemic patients (prolactin greater than 150 micrograms/L) with a pituitary macroadenoma were treated for 24 weeks with CV 205-502 given once daily. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum prolactin was measured at regular intervals. Prolactin levels decreased in all patients during treatment (mean pretreatment level, 2051.7 +/- 1077 micrograms/L [+/- SE]; 24 weeks, 39.0 +/- 11.3 micrograms/L; P = 0.0001); normal prolactin levels were achieved in 15 (58%). Tumor size decreased in 21 of 26 patients and ranged from 6% to 67% (mean, 19.2% +/- 3.4%). Onset or return of regular menses occurred in 11 of 15 premenopausal women, accompanied by an increase in estradiol concentrations (pretreatment, 186.5 +/- 25.0 pmol/L; on treatment, 690.9 +/- 104.3 pmol/L; P = 0.0003). Serum testosterone increased in 6 of 8 men; sexual function improved in 5 of 7 with pretreatment abnormalities. Two patients with reversible visual abnormalities improved within 2 weeks of starting treatment. Side effects occurred in 11 patients and abated over 1 to 2 weeks or after the dose was reduced. There was no evidence of toxicity as indicated by serial serum chemistries, liver function tests, hematologic profiles, thyroxine levels, and electrocardiogram studies. CONCLUSIONS: CV 205-502 reverses hyperprolactinemia and promotes reduction in tumor size with reversal of visual abnormalities and restoration of gonadal function in most patients. This compound will probably be useful in treating prolactinomas.\r"

Two patients had also failed to respond to splenectomy and repeated intravenous methylprednisolone infusions. Six patients had severe active renal disease at the time of treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Cyclophosphamide, 0.75 to 1.0 g/m2 body surface area, was given intravenously every month for at least 4 months. Prednisone dose ranged between 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg.d. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All seven patients had normal platelet counts within 2 to 18 weeks after cyclophosphamide treatment (one to four doses). Prednisone was tapered to 0.25 mg/kg on alternate days in all patients. All six patients had significant improvement in their renal disease and lupus serologies. Cyclophosphamide was discontinued after four to six doses in five patients. Four patients maintained normal platelet counts on low dose, alternate-day prednisone for a mean of 5.6 years of follow-up. Two patients had recurrence of thrombocytopenia 1 to 3 years after discontinuing cyclophosphamide.

The new focus is on carefully selected tests of vision, hearing, arm and leg function, urinary incontinence, mental status, instrumental and basic activities of daily living, environmental hazards, and social support systems. Brief questions and easily observed tasks are used to obtain the information needed for a suitable, effective screening while minimizing the time for administration. The approach can be incorporated into routine practice if certain relatively unproductive procedures are eliminated from the routine clinical examination, and particularly if internists are suitably compensated for the additional time.\r"

Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed in terms of a one- or two-compartment oral absorption model utilizing nonlinear regression analysis. The terminal elimination half-life was significantly prolonged in the group with severely impaired renal function (15.5 +/- 4.7 h) compared with that of the group with normal renal function (7.9 +/- 2.5 h). Apparent total body clearance was significantly reduced in the renally impaired (25.3 +/- 10.5 ml/min) in relation to the group with normal renal function (48.8 +/- 11.1 ml/min). The first-order absorption rate constants and apparent volumes of distribution did not differ between the two groups. These data indicate that the disposition of roxithromycin is significantly delayed in subjects with CLCRs of less than 15 ml/min and suggest that the roxithromycin dosing interval be doubled for these patients.\r"

All strains were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 micrograms of each agent per ml. The mean biofilm density produced by each strain was calculated from a total of eight determinations at each sub-MIC and was compared with the mean biofilm density of a drug-free control after correcting for differences in growth. The results showed that the density of the biofilm layer produced by 10 (42%) of 24 strains and 13 (54%) of 24 strains was significantly increased (P less than 0.006) at one or more sub-MICs of cefamandole or vancomycin, respectively. In contrast, the density of the biofilm produced by 9 (38%) of 24 and 2 (8%) of 24 strains was significantly reduced at one or more sub-MICs of cefamandole and vancomycin, respectively, and the biofilm density of 7 of these strains was decreased only when the sub-MIC was one-half the MIC. The biofilm density of six strains (five versus cefamandole and one versus vancomycin) was both enhanced and reduced by different sub-MICs of the same agent. None of the strains produced a detectable biofilm at or above the MIC for the strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted at the initiation of drug administration and after 6 and 12 weeks. Baseline liver function tests indicated normal values for bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time, while hepatic enzyme levels ranged from one to three times the normal levels. Initially, the mean peak ZDV concentration in plasma was 2,052 ng/ml with a range of 1,033 to 3,907 ng/ml, while during chronic dosing the peaks were 1,619 +/- 1,062 ng/ml and 1,711 +/- 786 ng/ml at weeks 6 and 12, respectively. ZDV concentrations at 4 h declined to 77 +/- 53 ng/ml, 110 +/- 43 ng/ml, and 101 +/- 49 ng/ml at weeks 1, 6, and 12, respectively. Initially, the plasma concentration-versus-time decay in three patients was linear, with a mean half-life (t1/2) of 1.3 +/- 0.5 h, while five patients had detectable concentrations in plasma after 4 h with an apparent delayed terminal-phase t1/2 of 4.8 +/- 2.8 h. At week 6 the prolonged elimination pattern was noted in all patients (terminal t1/2 = 4.1 +/- 2.0 h). No correlation between hepatic enzyme levels and t1/2 was noted. These findings suggest that ZDV may display a prolonged elimination phase during multiple dosing. Further studies utilizing a more sensitive assay may help to further define this later phase of ZDV elimination.\r"

The administered doses were 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg per day for 7 days. Fluconazole behaved as a high-magnitude inducer and significantly increased cytochrome P-450 concentrations already at 10 mg/kg (+42%). Cytochrome P-450 induction by fluconazole was dose dependent and reached a value of 302% of the control value at the dose of 160 mg/kg. The induction effects on cytochrome P-450 were also reflected in the drug-metabolizing enzyme activities in hepatic microsomes of pretreated rats. Fluconazole (160 mg/kg per day) preferentially induced the demethylase activities of N,N-dimethylaniline and p-nitroanisole to 258 and 281% of the control values, respectively. The detoxification enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase was significantly lowered by fluconazole at the highest dose. A possible link between the induction potential and the pharmacokinetic properties of triazole antifungal agents is discussed.\r"

In both Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptides (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides) accumulated at concentrations of ramoplanin close to the MIC, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis occurred after formation of cytoplasmic precursors. Susceptible bacteria bound or accumulated approximately 5 x 10(4) molecules of ramoplanin per cell, only 1/100th of the amount of vancomycin which binds to groups within peptidoglycan conforming to the pattern L-alpha alpha (amino acid)-D-alpha alpha-D-alpha alpha, suggesting that ramoplanin has a different target site. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. The incorporation of peptidoglycan precursors into nascent peptidoglycan of a toluenized cell preparation of B. megaterium was inhibited by ramoplanin, indicating that the antibiotic acts at a step before transpeptidation. In vitro studies of a wall-membrane particulate fraction of B. megaterium indicated that ramoplanin did not prevent the formation of lipid intermediate I (undecaprenyl-P-P-MurNAc-pentapeptide) but inhibited the next reaction in which N-acetylglucosamine is transferred to that lipid intermediate. The high concentrations required to inhibit in vitro peptidoglycan-synthesizing systems probably reflect the high concentrations of target sites present. High concentrations of ramoplanin also damage certain properties of the cell membrane, but low concentrations only affected wall synthesis in intact bacteria without perturbing membrane function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an effort to simplify the methods employed in identifying the different staphylococcal beta-lactamases, we evaluated whether distinctive substrate profiles could be obtained by using whole-cell suspensions of 115 beta-lactamase-producing isolates of S. aureus. Compared with extracts from the same strains, the whole-cell bacterial suspensions not only were simpler to prepare but enabled beta-lactamase typing of a higher proportion of the evaluated strains (86 versus 97%, respectively). Furthermore, the use of whole-cell bacterial suspensions enabled the simultaneous quantitation of the beta-lactamase activity exhibited by each strain. Additionally, by comparing the quantitative activity of beta-lactamase-induced and -uninduced preparations of the same strain, induction ratios (i.e., induced/uninduced activity) could be derived, yielding information regarding the regulation of beta-lactamase production by each strain. We believe that the utilization of whole-cell methods, such as those employed in this study, will facilitate the investigation of qualitative and quantitative differences in beta-lactamase production among clinical and reference isolates of S. aureus.\r"

Treatments included 400 mg of norfloxacin alone, 400 mg of norfloxacin 5 min after aluminum-magnesium hydroxide (Maalox), Maalox 2 h after 400 mg of norfloxacin, and 400 mg of norfloxacin 5 min after calcium carbonate (Titralac). Blood and urine samples were collected at predetermined time intervals for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Norfloxacin concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve from time zero to infinity and urinary recovery were used to compare the relative bioavailability of norfloxacin with antacids with that of norfloxacin alone. Norfloxacin bioavailability was markedly reduced when subjects received antacid pretreatment. When norfloxacin was given 5 min after Maalox and Titralac, the bioavailabilities were 9.02 and 37.5%, respectively, relative to that for 400 mg of norfloxacin alone. When Maalox was given 2 h after norfloxacin, maximal concentrations of norfloxacin in plasma occurred between 1 and 1.5 h postdose, and absorption was reduced to a lesser extent, with a relative bioavailability of 81.31%. Norfloxacin concentrations in urine were also reduced as a result of antacid administration. Antacids containing aluminum and magnesium salts and calcium carbonate should be avoided by patients taking norfloxacin.\r"

In this report we show that such assays are not easily applied to testing the susceptibilities of clinical HIV isolates to inhibitors because of differences in replication rates and cytotoxicity, thus demonstrating that conventional HIV assays should be used with caution when the zidovudine susceptibility of clinical isolates is assessed. An assay based on plaque reduction in CD4+ HeLa cell monolayers was validated by determining susceptibilities of HIV to a large number of inhibitors in this system. In general, 50% inhibitory doses for HIV type 1 and 2 strains derived from plaque reduction data were in good agreement with susceptibility data obtained by using conventional assays with T-cell lines. The susceptibilities of previously identified zidovudine-resistant HIV isolates to a large group of inhibitors, including nonucleosides, such as interferons and soluble CD4, were tested by using a plaque reduction assay in CD4+ HeLa cells. Surprisingly, an extremely narrow range of cross resistance was observed; cross resistance was limited to nucleoside analogs containing a 3'-azido group. These data point the way to the use of combinations of inhibitors to delay the appearance of drug resistance.\r"

Blood and blister fluid samples were taken at programmed times from all individuals included in the study. The analytical techniques for the determination of ofloxacin in both fluids were a plate diffusion method and a high-performance liquid chromatographic technique. The fitting of the experimental data to the kinetic model used was done with the help of the AUTOAN 2 and NONLIN 84 computer programs. In the groups of healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life mean values were found to be 5.1 and 5.9 h in plasma and blister fluid, respectively. The maximum concentration reached in plasma (3.9 micrograms/ml) proved to be slightly higher than that in interstitial tissue fluid (2.8 micrograms/ml). In the patients with renal impairment, the maximum concentrations in both plasma and blister fluid were significantly increased, in the order of 5 to 8 micrograms/ml in the former and 3 to 4 micrograms/ml in interstitial tissue fluid. The parameters seen to undergo an increase as a result of the renal impairment were the area under the curve of the plasma-time levels, the area under the curve of the blister fluid-time levels, and the elimination half-life in plasma and blister fluid. The degree of absorption and the access capacity of the drug to interstitial tissue fluid remained constant.\r"

Only two isoflavenes exhibited a significant inhibitory activity on the virus-induced cytopathic effect and plaque formation. In a single cycle of viral replication, both compounds reduced the viral yield by approximately 90%. The presence of the isoflavenes from the beginning of infection or during the adsorption period only prevented the shutoff of host translation and viral RNA and protein synthesis, suggesting that the drugs blocked an early step of viral replication. Indeed, both isoflavenes were not virucidal, did not protect virus infectivity from heat inactivation, and had no measurable effect on the binding of virus to cells, viral penetration, and uncoating of the viral RNA. In contrast, both compounds significantly reduced the infectivity of free viral RNA. The possibility that compounds interfere with poliovirus replication at a very early stage of translation of the input RNA is discussed.\r"

FEAU was also effective when given orally. However, in both cases this inhibitory effect was transient.\r"

This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. Joint stiffness and contractures also improved. The dose of D-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency.

Histologic examination of biopsy specimens from the involved area of skin revealed the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates and various degrees of collagen accumulation in the dermis, subcutis, fascia, and underlying muscle. Fibroblast cultures initiated from the involved skin exhibited 2.0- to 3.7-fold increased collagen production when compared with control fibroblast cultures established from the uninvolved skin of the same patients. Eosinophilic fasciitis fibroblasts also displayed 2.4- to 6.2-fold higher steady-state levels of type I procollagen messenger RNA than did the control cells, indicating pretranslational activation of type I procollagen gene expression. In addition, cellular fibronectin messenger RNA steady-state levels were elevated 1.9- to 3.3-fold in eosinophilic fasciitis fibroblasts. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the involved skin of patients with eosinophilic fasciitis exhibit an activated phenotype, similar to that of scleroderma fibroblasts, leading to accumulation of collagen in the skin and the underlying structures.\r"

Membrane attack complex of complement-related antigens in suprabasal intercellular sites could be detected after 5 hours of irradiation, at which time there was no acantholysis. At 24 hours, the staining intensity markedly increased and suprabasal clefts with acantholytic epidermal cells could be seen. In contrast, acantholysis did not develop in the absence of membrane attack complex formation at intercellular sites even 24 hours following UV-B irradiation. These findings suggest that UV-B can induce membrane attack complex assembly in the epidermis, which may itself be involved in the process of acantholysis and provide additional evidence for involvement of the complement system in pemphigus.\r"

In a chamber-scarification patch test, 75 (64%) of 118 patients with AD responded positively, compared with 1 (3%) of 35 healthy volunteers. However, no significant statistical correlations were found between contact sensitivity to P ovale in patients with AD and any of the following factors: age, sex, distribution of skin lesions, presence of pruriginous papules, history of infantile seborrheic dermatitis, or concomitance of other atopic diseases. Lymphocyte transformation test with P ovale antigen confirmed that those with positive patch test reactions showed significantly high stimulation indexes. The antigenic substances divided by gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography were found in a fraction of components with molecular weights above 60 kd. In addition, 25 (71%) of 35 patients with AD showed a positive immediate response to P ovale extract in a prick test, whereas none of 11 healthy volunteers showed any response. Although the incidence of the positive immediate responses was similar to that in contact sensitivity, there was no clear correlation between the delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Based on these results, we think that P ovale plays a role as an allergen derived from the host environment in the exacerbation of the skin lesions of AD.\r"

After 7 years of follow-up, the overall mortality rate was 52%. Mortality was higher for patients with malignancy. Cutaneous necrosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate appeared as potential markers of associated malignancy. Classic signs of poor prognosis, such as age and association with cancer were found. Interestingly, extensive cutaneous lesions on the trunk and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also more frequent among the patients who died. Our results demonstrate that selected groups of patients with DM, in part defined by cutaneous signs, have a poor prognosis.\r"

The cases include a 15 year old girl who over a three year period presented with multiple paragangliomata and an associated malignant carotid body tumour. All children were hypertensive, eight of 10 presenting with severe headaches. Diagnosis was based on finding a raised urinary vanillylmandelic acid excretion and plasma noradrenaline concentration. In addition six of eight children were hypercalcaemic with raised plasma calcitonin concentrations; plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations were high in two of seven and four out of eight children had raised plasma renin activities on presentation. No child, however, was found to have a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Despite the introduction of newer techniques for the detection of catecholamine producing tumours we found that selective arteriography and venous catecholamine sampling were superior for tumour localisation compared with ultrasound scanning, computed tomography, and metaiodo-benzyl-guanidine (MIBG) scanning.\r"

Fifty five were being treated with cyclosporin and 47 with azathioprine, and they were followed up for a maximum of five years. After one year 35 of those receiving cyclosporin (64%) and 34 of those receiving azathioprine (72%) were hypertensive; after five years the figures were 5/6 (83%) and 25/35 (71%), respectively. Recipients of grafts from living related donors had a lower incidence of hypertension than recipients of cadaveric grafts. The incidence of hypertension was higher in patients with acquired original kidney disease than in children with congenital or familial diseases. In both groups creatinine clearance and the frequency of acute rejection episodes did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive patients. When the lowest concentrations of cyclosporin in whole blood were more than 400 ng/ml the incidence of hypertension one year after transplantation was higher. The incidence of hypertension after renal transplantation in children is higher than that reported in adults. Acquired original disease, transplantation of cadaveric grafts, and nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin are all contributory factors.\r"

Forty seven mothers expressed concern about their babies (16%), whereas on direct questioning 241 (81%) reported symptoms present within the last 24 hours. One hundred and twenty three (41%) reported three or more. Many of the symptoms occurred in more than 15 babies (5%). The commonest were cold peripheries (117, 39%), noisy breathing (88, 30%), and rash (68, 23%). These had often been present for many days. Only 257/819 reported symptoms (31%) were of recent onset (less than 4 days) with 168 (21%) graded by the mother as moderate or severe. A few highly specific symptoms that were associated with serious conditions were rare. Symptoms cannot be interpreted without detailed questioning taking their severity and duration into account, and most occur too often to be used as indicators for referral.\r"

All 84 children collected urine at home by one of two Dipslide methods and by collection into boric acid within 24 hours of the hospital collected MSSU. The samples collected at home were posted to the hospital. Thirty six of the Dipslides (43%) and nine of the boric acid samples (10%) were not sterile but none had a pure growth of a single organism of greater than 10(5) organisms/ml. In addition, 17 of the Dipslides (20%) were returned with one or both media detached and therefore could not be relied upon to exclude urinary tract infection. In a second part to the study, 95 urines which showed a significant growth in primary culture were also cultured after storage in boric acid. Inhibition was noted in nine samples after storage in boric acid, seven of which were in underfilled bottles. Transport of specimens in boric acid produced less contamination than Dipslides but may inhibit growth in a small number of specimens. Technical failures with Dipslides were disappointingly high.\r"

There were 175 children with homozygous sickle cell disease, 106 with sickle cell haemoglobin C disease, and 150 controls with a normal haemoglobin genotype. In homozygous sickle cell disease, 48 boys (52%) and 31 girls (38%) were enuretic, a significantly higher prevalence than in those with sickle cell haemoglobin C disease--five boys (10%) and 11 girls (20%)--or in normal children--16 boys (22%) and 13 girls (17%). There was no significant difference between children with sickle cell haemoglobin C disease and the normal genotype. Boys with homozygous sickle cell disease were significantly more likely to be enuretic if they came from large families; there was a similar trend for girls with homozygous sickle cell disease, although it did not reach significance. Enuresis was more common in boys with homozygous sickle cell disease who had low concentrations of fetal haemoglobin and in girls with sickle cell haemoglobin C disease who had high mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentrations. Similar associations were not shown for girls with homozygous sickle cell disease or boys with sickle cell haemoglobin C disease.\r"

The clinical efficacy of the diet was studied and a 72 hour metabolic balance study was done. Twenty one patients recovered from diarrhoea within seven days. Median coefficients of absorption of nutrients in persistent diarrhoea patients were 68.0% (range 28.0 to 92.0) for total energy, 60.0% (range 21.0 to 97.0) for fat, 53.0% (range -122.0 to 82.0) for nitrogen, and 81.0% (range 23.0 to 97.0) for carbohydrates. The corresponding values among the control subjects were 90.0% (range 76.0 to 99.0), 95.0% (range 71.0 to 99.0), 70.0% (range 10.0 to 95.0), and 93.0% (range 85.0 to 98.0) respectively. Absorption of all macronutrients in the control subjects was on average significantly higher than in the patients. Nutrient absorption is substantially reduced in persistent diarrhoea and a rice based diet is clinically effective in most patients.\r"

A conservative approach to treatment was adopted, and when systemic treatment was indicated a short course of prednisolone was used first. Eight of the patients with single system disease required no treatment, while six received local treatment alone. Eight of the patients with multisystem disease did not require systemic treatment, 17 were given prednisolone alone, and 19 were given cytotoxic drugs. Of the 14 with single system disease 13 had no long term after effects. Eight of the patients with multisystem disease died, 24 had long term after effects, and 12 had none. Outcome was related to age and Lahey score. These results compare favourably with other series in which more aggressive approaches were used, and support our conservative approach to treatment.\r"

Five patients received a high transfusion regimen before and after surgery and 25 a lower one. Follow up after surgery ranged from one to four years. Partial splenectomy improved the long term haematological state in the six patients with thalassaemia intermedia. Recurrence of hypersplenism occurred in nine of the 24 patients with thalassaemia major, however, and complete splenectomy was required. Serum IgM concentrations were not significantly modified by surgery. The mean (SD) residual spleen after surgery was 4.45 (2.36) cm measured by scintigraphy. No severe infections occurred after surgery; however, most patients were routinely treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin and the protective effect of the remaining spleen could not be exactly determined. Because of the possibility of recurrence of hypersplenism, routine partial splenectomy when splenectomy is needed in thalassaemia major is not advised, except in children under 5 years whose risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection is greatest.\r"

The results showed a typical primary pollutant trend: 18.1 micrograms/m3 during winter and 12.02 micrograms/m3 during summer. During the winter, the VHH indoor/outdoor contamination ratio showed a greater indoor presence (p = .0006) and a higher VHH blood concentration (0.71 vs. 0.22 micrograms/l). The indoor and outdoor atmospheric VHH concentrations provide the major sources of human daily intake, especially during winter.\r"

Both subgroups were followed from 1976 through December 1987. Among specific causes of death, only lung cancer was found to be significantly higher than expected for all platers (16 observed, 8.9 expected; SMR 179; 95% CI 102-290). This elevated SMR, however, was not statistically significant in either of the two plater subgroups. The SMR for lung cancer of the chromium plater subgroup was highest among those exposed for the shortest period and among those exposed in the most remote calendar years.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was undertaken to provide quantitative estimates of soil ingestion in young children on a population basis, and to identify demographic and behavioral characteristics that influence the amount of soil ingested. A total of 104 children between the ages of 2 and 7 yr were selected randomly from the population of a three-city area in southeastern Washington State. Using aluminum, silicon, and titanium as tracer elements, a mass-balance approach was employed to assess daily soil ingestion. A duplicate of all food items consumed, all feces, and some urine excreted were collected on 4 consecutive d, along with soil and house dust samples from each child's home. Samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. After adjustment of the soil ingestion estimates to account for missing food, excreta samples, and nonfood items consumed, the average daily values based on the three tracer elements were: aluminum, 38.9 mg/d (median = 25.3 mg/d); silicon, 82.4 mg/d (median = 59.4 mg/d); and titanium, 245.5 mg/d (median = 81.3 mg/d). No consistent pattern emerged regarding a demographic or behavioral profile that was predictive of soil ingestion. This work demonstrates (a) the feasibility of conducting large-scale studies to determine soil intake levels in human populations, (b) provides estimates of soil ingestion in small children based on a random population sample, and (c) suggests several possibilities for additional research initiatives in this area.\r"

One recent case of lead poisoning coupled with many complaints from the Vancouver identification Squad members initiated a study regarding the elemental composition of, and the occupational exposure to, these powders. Multi-elemental analysis of the powders investigated showed that all contained varying amounts of aluminum, calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium, manganese, and nickel. One powder, however, contained 41% lead. The time spent at the scene of crime during a normal working shift averaged 95.5 min. Assessment of inhalation exposure during this period by personal air sampling pumps never exceeded the occupational exposure standards for these elements. Secondary exposure from dust-contaminated police vehicles and clothing can be an important contributor to overall exposure.\r"

Study objectives included determining the prevalence of exposure to ETS using urinary cotinine and identifying questionnaire exposure measures predictive of cotinine. Findings demonstrate that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is extremely prevalent, even among those not living with a smoker. A total of 76% of subjects reported exposure to ETS in the 4 d preceding the interview. The most frequently mentioned sources of exposure were at work (28%) and at home (27%). Cotinine was found in the urine of 91% of subjects. Cotinine values increased significantly with the number of exposures reported. Among the different questionnaire measures of exposure that were evaluated, the single best predictor of cotinine was the number of friends and family members seen regularly by the subject who smoke.\r"

During the past 40 yr, water has been supplied to these persons via wells from a common aquifer. On the basis of local age-specific incidence data, no difference in age distribution was found between clustered and nonclustered cases. The incidence of Parkinson's disease is about five times greater in each of the three kibbutzim than in the remainder of the region. The three kibbutzim in the cluster use similar agricultural chemicals, as do other kibbutzim. Although associations with rural residence and well water use have been reported elsewhere, clusters of this sort have not been reported. Clusters strongly suggest that common environmental factors exist. Drinking water and agricultural chemicals are the most likely common environmental factors.\r"

Two useful approaches for assessing prolonged induction and latency periods are (1) exposure lagging and (2) considering exposures only within moving time windows. The exposure weighting scheme proposed by Jahr2 to assess exposure burdens is another method that accounts for induction and latency, although not explicitly. These three approaches, which are shown to be special cases of exposure weighting, are illustrated with an analysis of lung cancer mortality among a cohort of workers from an asbestos textile plant.\r"

Special stains, to confirm the character of both mesothelial and dendritic cells (melanocytes), were also performed. The above findings constitute the first complete documentation of the relationship of melanocytes with mesothelial cells in humans. Thus, the possibility of primary melanosis peritonei, independent of melanogenic tumors of the ovary, is shown.\r"

Histologic features were scored semiquantitatively from 0 to 3+. Peripheral SCC represented 16% of all resected SCCs. The proportion of patients with multiple symptoms was lower and survival during the 5 years after surgery was better in the peripheral group. Tumor size, mitoses per high-power field (2.4 +/- 0.3 vs 4.1 +/- 0.6 [SEM]), prevalence of lymphatic invasion (19% vs 58%), and lymph node metastases (5% vs 37%) were lower, while chest wall invasion was more frequent (25% vs 0) for peripheral SCCs. Peripheral tumors also had more intense (2 or 3+) lymphoplasmacytic (86% vs 47%) and desmoplastic (95% vs 68%) reactions. Cox regression analysis did not support a significant relationship between tumor location and survival. We conclude that, compared with the central SCC, peripheral SCC is associated with fewer symptoms at presentation and better survival. Morphologically, peripheral SCCs are smaller, have fewer mitoses, less prevalent lymphatic invasion, and a more intense stromal reaction. Improved survival in patients with peripheral SCC may be due to a more favorable stage at the time of initial treatment.\r"

Adenocarcinomas showed the highest density of reacting sites, while undifferentiated carcinomas were the less-reacting variant. Areas of metaplasia and hyperplasia showed some variation in the lectin-binding profile with normal tissues, but as a whole, there was a much smaller number of reacting sites than tumors.\r"

Recanalized thrombi occluded the lumina of some of the calcified vessels. On the basis of these distinctive histologic findings, hyperparathyroidism was accurately predicted. These changes have previously been cited in the internal medicine and dermatology literature but, to our knowledge, not in the pathology literature.

We have recently encountered three cases of Hedley-Whyte-type pink spots during routine postmortem brain examination. In two of these cases, the patient's clinical history included a bacterial infection, which could account for the deposition of bacteria within the central nervous system blood vessels. In the third case, the patient had no clinical history of bacterial infection, and had a negative postmortem blood culture. On microscopic examination, all three cases showed central nervous system intravascular presence of bacteria within the macroscopically recognized pink spots. To test the hypothesis that pink spots result from bacterial fermentation products, at the time of postmortem removal of brains (different from the brains mentioned above), we perfused blood vessels in three brains with 100% ethanol. Subsequent macroscopic examination after fixation in formaldehyde revealed discoloration similar to the Hedley-Whyte spots.\r"

  ".U": "90240891\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship of sarcoidosis to renal insufficiency is not widely known by pathologists or clinicians. During an 8-year period beginning in 1980, we observed six patients with sarcoidosis and clinically significant renal insufficiency (serum creatinine, greater than 260 mumol/L). In one of these patients with long-standing sarcoidosis, renal insufficiency was attributed to unrelated primary renal disease until renal biopsy specimen showed interstitial noncaseating granulomas. The four patients with renal insufficiency at presentation differed from the typical patient with sarcoidosis because they were white men who lacked the usual clinical constellation of skin, eye, and pulmonary involvement. All four had noncaseating granulomas on their initial biopsy (bone marrow [3 patients], and lymph node [1 patient]), suggesting each had sarcoidosis, yet each had two or more follow-up biopsies before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was accepted and appropriate therapy initiated. One of these four patients underwent long-term antifungal and antituberculous therapy. The major causes of renal insufficiency in these six patients were complications of hypercalcemia and interstitial granulomatous nephritis. Except in one patient with nephrocalcinosis, prednisone therapy resulted in a dramatic fall in serum creatinine level with resolution of hypercalcemia. Sarcoidosis is a rare, but treatable, cause of renal insufficiency. Early recognition by clinicians and pathologists may spare patients from undergoing unnecessary biopsies and result in more timely initiation of therapy.\r"

Most of the tumors have been large (over 9 cm) and have been responsible for significant symptomatology. Microscopic examination has typically shown mildly to moderately cellular fibrous tumors with prominent hyalinization, although occasional tumors have exhibited focal marked cellularity. Cytologic atypicality and mitotic figures have been rare or absent. Immunohistochemical stains have shown positivity only for vimentin. There has been no evidence of recurrence in any of the cases. The clinical, gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of these tumors are identical to those of fibrous tumors of the pleura, and a similar origin from submesothelial mesenchyme is likely.\r"

Three of the patients had recurrent or metastatic lesions 3 to 9 years after resection of the primary ovarian tumor. These three cases demonstrated diploidy in both the primary tumor and metastatic or recurrent lesions. Among the seven cases without recurrence, five had diploid DNA indexes. One case was characterized by a high degree of cytologic atypia and tetraploidy (DNA index, 1.98); this patient died of metastatic breast cancer 4 years after resection of the ovarian tumor. Another case demonstrated a high mitotic rate and exhibited aneuploidy (DNA index, 1.33); this woman was alive and well at 5 years of follow-up. In this study, no correlation was found between the recurrence rate and ploidy but, in view of the small numbers and limited follow-up, we cannot definitively analyze these prognostic factors. It does not appear feasible to predict the clinical course of granulosa cell tumors by DNA flow cytometry. However, it can be concluded that: (1) most granulosa cell tumors have diploid DNA content and (2) DNA ploidy correlates well with histologic factors, such as cellular anaplasia and high mitotic activity, which may have predictive prognostic value for granulosa cell tumors.\r"

The purpose of this study was to analyze normal ovaries, ovarian stromal tumors (fibroma/thecomata and granulosa cell tumors), and ovarian leiomyomata for desmin reactivity. Groups of ovarian stromal cells that expressed desmin were noted in six of six normal ovaries. Desmin was also detected in two of six fibroma/thecomata and two of two ovarian leiomyomata. The number of tumor cells with detectable desmin was much greater in the leiomyomata. Desmin was not detected in any of six granulosa cell tumors. We conclude that stromal cells with an immunohistochemical feature of smooth-muscle cells are routinely found in normal ovaries. This study demonstrates the usefulness of immunohistochemistry in corroborating the diagnosis of ovarian leiomyomata, although desmin positivity per se is not diagnostic of ovarian leiomyomata, and also raises the possibility that some ovarian leiomyomata may be derived from stromal cells.\r"

Neurofilament was the most frequently detected intermediate filament in the neuroendocrine tumors. Cytokeratin was seen in the intra-adrenal but not the extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Coexpression of neurofilament and cytokeratin was common in the neuroendocrine tumors, and occasionally vimentin was also expressed simultaneously. There were no characteristic differences in the expression of intermediate filaments between multiple endocrine neoplasia type I or II tumors and sporadic-type tumors or between metastatic tumors and nonmetastatic tumors.\r"

The usefulness of this practice is unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of frozen autologous red blood cell use in two hospitals. Records were available for 21- and 9-year intervals, respectively. A total of 104 autologous units were cryopreserved for 41 patients. Fifteen (37%) of 41 patients received one or more of their stored units of red blood cells. Twenty-two patients had autologous units frozen in anticipation of elective surgery; 11 (50%) of these 22 patients received some or all of their stored units. Sixteen patients had autologous units stored because of potential transfusion problems related to rare blood types or to the presence of multiple blood cell alloantibodies, and another 3 patients had units frozen simply at their personal request. Only 4 (21%) of these latter 19 patients who donated without a specific planned use eventually received their frozen autologous red blood cells. Long-term autologous frozen red blood cell storage can improve medical management of some patients with anticipated surgical procedures or unusual requirements for transfusion. However, our study suggests that most autologous units frozen without specific planned use will not be transfused.\r"

After a verbal warning with a variable foreperiod, a visual trace appeared on an oscilloscope to indicate a sway magnitude equaling half the subject's maximal voluntary sway. Body movement was cued in three directions--forward, and toward the paretic and nonparetic lower extremities. In order to assess extraneous postural patterns, all three directions of sway were analyzed for each trial. The results showed that with cued lateral sway (right or left) there was a tendency for hemiplegic subjects to reduce the dispersion (or variability) of the sway path. Clustering of the active lateral postural response near the geometric center of the sway path indicated a restricted balance response in this plane of motion. During cued forward sway the variability of the sway path was not statistically different from the able-bodied, but three-dimensional visualization of the sway pattern illustrated a qualitatively different postural response with extraneous, nonfocused balance activity biased toward the nonparetic lower extremity. Short-term practice did not alter the dispersion of the sway path for hemiplegic or able-bodied subjects in any direction. Hemiplegic extraneous movement in one case (forward sway) and restricted movement in another (lateral sway) emphasize the level of specificity which needs to be addressed during rehabilitation of balance.\r"

Diagnostic methods, such as qualitative photoplethysmography (PPG), have enabled the physician to assess deep-vein valvular incompetence earlier and begin specific treatment measures to slow the progression of symptoms. This study group, comprised of 100 patients, was diagnosed initially with deep-venous thrombophlebitis and evaluated by phleborrheography and PPG at three-month intervals for one year. The patients were instructed to wear fitted, graded compression hosiery after hospital discharge; compliance was 37% at one year. The primary reason for noncompliance was socioeconomic. The price of the ideal graded compression hosiery was not easily within reach of this population and insurance reimbursement was difficult or impossible to obtain. Complaint patients felt better while wearing the compression hosiery. Increasing deterioration of qualitative PPG values of deep-valve assessment was found in both compliant and noncompliant patients at each testing interval. The PPG value deteriorated as time increased with or without the compression hose, although symptoms lessened when the prescribed hosiery was worn. The long-term sequelae of wearing or not wearing the hosiery are yet to be determined, but PPG assessment is normalized with the hosiery in place.\r"

Six cases of concomitant nocturnal calf cramps and fasciculations associated with the night pain and paresthesias are reported. In all cases a reduction in cardiopulmonary compliance was noted, with clinical and electromyographic evidence of paraspinal and lower extremity fasciculations increasing at night. Symptoms were relieved by assuming an erect or semi-reclining sleep position. In five of the six reported cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis was also present.

Sixty-four patients (24 men and 40 women) with a mean age of 48 +/- 10 years were studied. Mean (+/- SD) lipid concentrations (mg/dL) for men and women, respectively, were 220 +/- 46 and 213 +/- 43 for TC; 38.5 +/- 8.6 and 59.1 +/- 18.1 for HDL-C; 148 +/- 46 and 129 +/- 36 for LDL-C; and 205 +/- 107 and 105 +/- 55 for TG. Hyperlipidemia was found in 16 of 24 men and 10 of 40 women. In the men, mean HDL-C concentration was in the lowest decile of our hospital laboratory's reference range, whereas mean TC/HDL-C ratio was elevated above the recommended value.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the symptomatic and physiologic responses during moderate to heavy resistance exercise in a population with coronary artery disease. After at least 12 weeks of aerobic training without experiencing complications, 15 male cardiac patients were selected for the study. Approximately one week after a graded exercise test (GXT), each patient's maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was determined on seven upper-body Nautilus machines. Resistance exercises, consisting of two sets of seven repetitions at a submaximal intensity (75% MVC) for each exercise, were then performed on two nonconsecutive occasions; symptomatic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic responses were recorded and analyzed for patients both on and off beta-blockers. During the MVC and submaximal exercise trials, no significant untoward hemodynamic change was noted with heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or rate pressure product, and no patient complained of angina or developed ischemic electrocardiographic changes. However, three incidences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occurred. During the GXT, there were 13 incidences of angina, ischemia, or PVCs. Patients taking beta-blockers had significantly lower (p less than .01) values for heart rate and rate pressure product during the GXT, MVC, and submaximal trials. These results suggest that clinically stable, aerobically trained cardiac patients may perform moderate to heavy resistance exercises without experiencing complications.\r"

Changes in the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric (ME) signal have been used in the limb muscles as an objective measurement of muscle function. Based on our previous investigational work on limb muscles, we attempted to measure parameters related to median frequency (MF) of the ME signal to measure localized muscle fatigue in cervical paraspinal muscles in 14 healthy subjects. The ME signals were recorded bilaterally using surface electrodes placed posteriorly at the C3 to C6 level. Sustained isometric neck extensions were performed at 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100% of maximum voluntary contractions (MVC). Initial median frequency (IMF) and slope of the MF during sustained isometric contraction were obtained by analyzing the ME signal using an IBM-XT computer, a laboratory interface system, and custom-designed software. The results indicated that the MF of the CPM behave somewhat differently from limb muscles, and that the CPM are less fatigable than limb muscles. The test-retest reliability, using our system, was found to be high, and data processing showed a variability of 4 to 8Hz. These results imply that neck muscles appear to behave differently at high and low force levels in response to daily functional demand. The MF measurements appear to be a useful objective technique for evaluating muscle function of cervical musculature.\r"

Both were found to have toxic levels of Dilantin. Neither revealed the classic neurologic or gastrointestinal complaints. Although one patient had documented family and social stressors, the other had a stable home life. Both patients recovered remarkably once their Dilantin dosages were adjusted. In such patients who present with change in mood, sleeping, and eating patterns, Dilantin toxicity should be suspected. Serum blood levels should be checked, and dosage adjusted before the addition of antidepressant medication. Possible causes for Dilantin-associated depression are discussed in detail.\r"

The case reported here describes a 42-year-old woman who underwent heart transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy. One year after transplantation, the patient was hospitalized for evaluation of headaches and mental status changes. A lymphoma involving the left basal ganglia was diagnosed and the patient underwent a course of radiation therapy. She was transferred for rehabilitation of a left hemiparesis and made functional gains in mobility and self-care skills. Weekly recordings of heart rate and blood pressure were obtained before and after ambulation. Small increases in both heart rate and blood pressure were recorded after ambulation to the point of fatigue. In both parameters, the patient's maximum response was below that reported for nondisabled cardiac recipients, highlighting the need for symptom-oriented exercise guidelines in these patients.\r"

A survey was conducted to determine the functional and vocational outcome of patients three years after orthotopic liver transplantation. Questionnaires were sent to 45 patients who had liver transplants in 1985, of whom 31 responded. Fourteen patients (47%) reported abnormal function in at least one limb; four patients (13%) reported developing gout. All patients were independent in ADLs and mobility; assistive devices were used by four patients. Nineteen patients (61%) reported severe impairment in endurance before transplant; 15 (48%) were unable to ambulate outside the house. After transplant only two patients (6%) reported severely impaired endurance, and all but two were able to walk at least three blocks. Three years after transplant, 12 patients (39%) were working full time and eight patients (26%) were homemakers. Work performance was most commonly limited by fractures (12 patients) and lack of concentration (seven patients). Thus, despite frequent limitations in limb function, patients after liver transplant are largely independent in ADLs and mobility, have improved endurance, and can often return to work despite physical limitations.\r"

The neuropathy was documented by nerve conduction studies which revealed reduced amplitude of the sensory and motor evoked responses and slowed conduction velocities that were consistent with axon loss. Sural nerve biopsy revealed mild axonal loss distally without eosinophilic infiltration. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids with a rapid normalization of his eosinophil count. Neurologic examination six months later revealed a slight improvement in his motor strength and reflexes but no change in sensory functions. Follow-up electromyographic evaluation demonstrated an average 89% improvement in evoked potential amplitudes and a slight improvement in distal latencies and conduction velocities. These findings suggest that the neuropathy associated with hypereosinophilia is axonal in nature and that there is a temporal relationship between reduction in the absolute eosinophil count and the improvement of the neuropathy.\r"

Fetal tissue was obtained from elective abortion. The woman and the patient with Parkinson's disease were unknown to each other. The woman gave specific consent and was not paid. The patient had a 20-year history of parkinsonism treated with multiple drug therapies including levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet) every 2 1/2 hours. His symptoms were worse on the left side. For 5 months prior to transplantation, the patient underwent clinical evaluations by both a neurologist and a computer system installed in his home for daily measurement of walking and hand movements. Preoperative positron emission tomographic scanning with 6-L[18F]fluorodopa (fluorodopa) demonstrated severe dopamine depletion bilaterally. Fetal tissue was matched to the patient for ABO blood antigens, and maternal serum was screened for hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 prior to surgery. Fetal tissue was implanted stereotactically throughout the caudate and putamen on the right side of the brain via 10 needle tracks. The patient was not immunosuppressed. Results 12 months after surgery showed 42% improvement in left-hand speed before the first morning dose of drug and 40% greater response to drug therapy. Right-hand speed increased 15% before drug therapy and 23% after drug therapy. Reaction time was unaffected. Walking speed increased 33% after drug administration, although walking speed before the first morning dose of drugs declined 40%. Walking speed on an all-day basis improved 17%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found (1) a poor interobserver agreement, and (2) a correlation between computed tomographic scan and MRI white matter changes but not between computed tomographic and MRI periventricular changes.

Structural brain damage, focal neurologic deficits, epileptogenic findings on electroencephalograms, and provocative drug use were all considered pertinent variables for seizure risk. Seizures did not occur during alcohol detoxification in any of the study patients, despite a high incidence of antecedent seizures and provocative drug use. Oral chlordiazepoxide use during detoxification was associated with the elimination of withdrawal seizures. Of all 301 patients, 64 had a history of seizures, 42 had significantly abnormal electroencephalograms during detoxification, and 30 had focal slowing on the electroencephalogram. There was no correlation between the duration of alcohol abuse or lifetime consumption of alcohol and seizure activity. There was, however, a significant correlation between the number of inpatient alcohol detoxifications and the prevalence of seizure disorders. This correlation held true even when provocative drug use was taken into consideration.\r"

The latter cases were not differentiated from those with isolated torticollis in terms of any of the demographic or clinical features studied, although they tended to have suffered from torticollis longer. Fifteen patients (20.8%) had experienced a spontaneous remission of their torticollis, which was sustained for a median period of 3 years in 9 cases (12.5%). Eighty-seven percent of the 15 remissions had occurred during the first 5 years of the illness. In the 9 cases with sustained remission, the duration of torticollis before spontaneous remission was significantly longer and remission had mostly occurred after 2 years of illness compared with the 6 who had relapsed. The 15 cases with spontaneous remission tended to have an earlier age of onset compared with those with no remission. Sixty-five percent of cases were correctly classified on the basis of age at onset, which emerged as the only salient variable in the discrimination of the 15 patients with spontaneous remission from the 57 without spontaneous remission. Age at onset, form of torticollis, gender, and direction of head deviation resulted in a correct classification rate of 70%, in the discrimination of the 9 cases with sustained remission from those with no remission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results indicated that patients with progressive supranuclear palsy were particularly impaired when a task required sequential movements, conceptual shifting, monitoring the frequency with which stimuli are presented, or rapid retrieval of verbal knowledge. These deficits could not simply be accounted for by slowed information processing or by a deficit in representational knowledge. Conceivably, \"weak activation\" of frontal lobe representational knowledge characterized by an observed attentional deficit results in the neuropsychological impairments noted in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. The oral administration of physostigmine, under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions, did not facilitate executive or attentional performance as evaluated by our tasks.\r"

In contrast with the adult patients, the children with left-hemisphere lesions displayed the normal pattern of predominant left-hemisphere engagement in visuospatial tasks. These data suggest that language restitution and development following early lesions involves intrahemispheric rather than interhemispheric functional reorganization.\r"

We describe eight patients with focal and generalized seizures following CEA. Seizures occurred 6 to 13 days after CEA. All began as focal motor seizures contralateral to the side of the CEA, and six patients developed generalized tonoclonic seizures. Lorazepam and phenytoin sodium controlled the seizures. Five patients without evidence of stroke on computed tomographic scan were normal in follow-up and had no further seizures. The other three patients had mild deficits. One developed a chronic seizure disorder. The pathogenesis of this syndrome following CEA remains unclear, but may involve cerebral hyperperfusion, cerebral embolization, or both.\r"

No stimulation at all, tactile unilateral and bilateral, binaural auditory verbal, and nonverbal stimuli were randomly applied to 14 patients with right-hemisphere strokes. Only nonverbal stimuli decreased the neglect. As nonverbal stimuli mainly activate the right hemisphere, the decrease in neglect suggests right-hemispheric hypoactivity at rest in these patients. The absence of modification of neglect during verbal stimulation suggests a bilateral hemispheric activation and the persistence of interhemispheric imbalance. Our results showed that auditory pathways take part in the network involved with neglect. Passive nonverbal auditory stimuli may be of interest in the rehabilitation of patients with left visual neglect.\r"

  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) alterations, as determined by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl propylenamine oxime (Tc 99m-HM-PAO), were studied in 15 infants and children presenting with cerebrovascular disorders between the ages of 2 weeks and 16 years. The rCBF patterns were correlated with clinical presentation, electroencephalographic patterns, radiologic studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and cerebral angiography. All patients presented with motor weakness that was accompanied in some with dysphasia, defects in visual fields, obtundation, seizures, and high temperature. Perturbations of rCBF with Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning were detected in all patients investigated, with no adverse effects related to the radiotracer. All patients had a focal area of decreased rCBF, with adjacent hyperemia in 3 patients. In 7 patients, there was an rCBF decrease in a vascular distribution, mainly that of the middle cerebral artery, that correlated with the clinical findings and a focal electroencephalogram, as well as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Impairment of rCBF was more extensive in 3 children, while early abnormal SPECT findings preceded abnormal computed tomographic findings in another 2 children. In 2 patients, Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT was the only positive radiologic test to correlate with focal clinical and electroencephalographic abnormalities, in view of repeated normal computed tomographic scans. We conclude that Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning is a sensitive, complementary diagnostic measure in the early detection, localization, and estimation of rCBF alterations in pediatric cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Eight of 9 seropositive patients were male (8 of 12 male patients vs 2 of 24 controls). Rates of seropositivity were lower among patients with ALS from nonendemic areas. All patients had typical ALS; none had typical Lyme disease. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined in 24 ALS patients--3 (all with severe bulbar involvement) appeared to have intrathecal synthesis of anti-B burgdorferi antibody. Following therapy with antibiotics, 3 patients with predominantly lower motor neuron abnormalities appeared to improve, 3 with severe bulbar dysfunction deteriorated rapidly, and all others appeared unaffected. There appears to be a statistically significant association between ALS and immunoreactivity to B burgdorferi, at least among men living in hyperendemic areas.\r"

The 4-mm-diameter central ablation zone ranged in depth from 11 microns (-2 diopters effect) to 46 microns (-8 diopters effect). Corneas were studied for the 9 months postoperatively by clinical slit-lamp microscopy, and periodically with light and transmission electron microscopy. By 6 weeks, mild to moderate subepithelial haze was apparent in 93% of the corneas, with considerable variability in density. Progressive clearing occurred so that by 6 to 9 months 12 of 13 surviving corneas (92%) were either completely clear (4 corneas) or trace hazy (8 corneas). The epithelium was thickened at 21 days after ablation and returned to normal thickness by 3 months. At 3 weeks, subepithelial fibroblasts were three times the density of normal keratocytes and returned to nearly normal numbers by 9 months. We concluded that the anterior monkey cornea demonstrated a mild, typical wound healing response after excimer laser keratomileusis.\r"

Distances from the corneal limbus to where the fiberoptic probe was placed, perpendicular to the conjunctiva, were varied, as were the energy values. Gross, light microscopic, and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed that contact probe placement at a distance of 1.5 mm from the corneal limbus with an energy setting of 2 J provided optimum cyclophodestructive results. Slight superficial damage to the sclera was detected, but observations indicated no alterations to the adjacent anatomical structures. To obtain lesions to the ciliary processes in living eyes similar to those previously noted in human cadavers, comparatively lower energy values (2 J) were required. To exploit all the mechanisms that may lead to a decrease in intraocular pressure, precise hitting of the aqueous humor secretory structure may prove to be of primary importance.\r"

The pneumotonometer and TonoPen (Oculab, La Jolla, Calif) are alternative tonometers for use in these eyes, yet the accuracy of determining IOP with the Tono-Pen has not been determined manometrically. We performed a clinical and manometric study comparing the Tono-Pen with the pneumotonometer in gasfilled vitrectomized eyes. In our clinical study, we measured IOP in 50 eyes of 50 patients with corneal irregularities following vitrectomy and air/gas-fluid exchange. Tono-Pen measurements were highly correlated with those of the pneumotonometer. However, there was a mean difference of 1.4 mm Hg between Tono-Pen and pneumotonometer IOP readings. A larger percentage of Tono-Pen readings were lower than those of the pneumotonometer as IOP levels increased. To assess the accuracy of these tonometers, we compared manometric readings via an indwelling catheter with Tono-Pen and pneumotonometer IOP readings in 11 eye bank eyes following a lensectomy, vitrectomy, and air-fluid exchange. Overall, Tono-Pen and pneumotonometer readings were highly correlated with those of the manometer. However, both machines showed a significant underestimation of IOP at pressures greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg; pneumotonometer and Tono-Pen readings averaged 10.2 and 12.1 mm Hg lower, respectively, than those of the manometer. We conclude that both the pneumotonometer and the Tono-Pen underestimate IOP at pressures greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 6 months' minimum follow-up, anatomic success (retina attached posterior to buckle and an intraocular pressure of 3 mm Hg or more) was achieved in 35 eyes (64%). Functional success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was achieved in 14 eyes (26%).

  ".W": "Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is a chorioretinal inflammatory disease occurring in young, healthy adults. Its cause is unknown, although it frequently follows a flulike illness. We reexamined 30 patients with documented acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy to determine their HLA class I antigen (A and B) and class II antigen (DR and DQ) distribution. The HLA class I antigen B7 was found in 12 patients (40.0%) compared with 63 controls (16.6%) (relative risk, 3.38). The class II antigen DR2 was present in 17 patients (56.7%) compared with 107 controls (28.2%) (relative risk, 3.34). The specific role of HLA antigens in uveitis is unknown, but the finding of an increased prevalence of HLA-B7 and HLA-DR2 antigens in patients with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy suggests an immunogenetic predisposition to acquiring this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Individuals with papilledema due to intracranial hypertension often exhibit a loss of contrast sensitivity confined to low spatial frequency (coarse detail), which can disappear following treatment of the intracranial hypertension. The basis of the initial loss may be revealed by the rate of sensitivity recovery. We monitored the contrast sensitivity of seven patients immediately before and after surgical treatment in which a shunt was placed for intracranial hypertension. Compared with normal controls, the 13 of 14 eyes with papilledema exhibited the characteristic preshunt loss of sensitivity. For the first 3 days after shunt placement, sensitivity remained approximately equal to preshunt levels. By postshunt days 4 through 6, sensitivity rapidly normalized and remained normal for up to 1 year. Based on the rate and pattern of sensitivity normalization, we conclude that the initial loss represents an interaction of axoplasmic stasis with ischemia at the level of the optic nerve.\r"

In open angle glaucoma, the neuroretinal rim area was negatively correlated with the cup-disc ratio and the disc volume. Total field loss was positively correlated with the cup-disc ratio and the disc volume and negatively correlated with the neuroretinal rim area. Eyes with low-tension glaucoma showed a negative correlation between neuroretinal rim area and cup-disc ratio, and between total field loss and rim area. However, low-tension glaucomatous eyes did not have significant correlations between disc volume and rim area and between total field loss and cup-disc ratio or disc volume. Cupping in low-tension glaucoma was broadly sloping, resulting in less disc volume alteration.\r"

Seven had the disease complicated by neurological or other systemic abnormalities, while the other 6 patients had only ophthalmic abnormalities. All 13 patients were hyperopic. The magnitude of hyperopia did not differ significantly between the complicated and uncomplicated groups. Therefore, one cannot, as previously suggested, use the presence of high hyperopia to differentiate an uncomplicated form of Leber's congenital amaurosis from one complicated by neurologic or other systemic abnormalities. The concurrence of hyperopia with Leber's congenital amaurosis should not steer the physician away from careful neurologic systemic or biochemical evaluation of the child.\r"

  ".W": "The posterior pole of the eyes of rhesus monkeys was exposed to the light of an indirect ophthalmoscope. The tissue changes caused by repeated (three to five) photic injuries were compared with those produced by a single photic insult. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic examinations showed a progressive involvement of the foveal area after multiple exposures to light. Histopathologic study showed that after one exposure the retinal pigment epithelium appeared focally atrophic. Plaques of proliferated retinal pigment epithelium could also be seen, and on the anterior surface of these plaques a layer of relatively cuboidal hypopigmented retinal pigment epithelial cells was present. With multiple exposures, focal areas of total absence of retinal pigment epithelium were seen in these eyes. The eyes that received only one exposure showed partially regenerated photoreceptor outer segments. After repeated photic exposures, the photoreceptor outer segments failed to regenerate even 6 to 8 months after the last exposure. In one eye exposed five times for 60 minutes, areas of total absence of photoreceptor cells could be seen, and the inner nuclear layer was directly apposed to Bruch's membrane. These experimental exposures to the light of an indirect ophthalmoscope were 60 to 120 minutes long and were not comparable to clinical exposures of the ophthalmoscope in patient examination. Our observation highlighted the cumulative effects of repeated light injury to the retinal pigment epithelial and photoreceptor cells and also showed the similarity between this animal model of photic maculopathy and the changes present in the eyes of human patients with atrophic agerlated macular degeneration.\r"

Both mouse-derived epidermal growth factor and human-derived epidermal growth factor significantly increased the tensile strength of full-thickness corneal wounds after 9 days of topical therapy. For human-derived epidermal growth factor, a concentration of 10 mg/L administered twice daily produced the maximal effect. An increase in either the concentration of epidermal growth factor or its frequency of administration failed to induce a further increase in wound strength. Indeed, at a concentration of 100 mg/L, human-derived epidermal growth factor appeared to lose its ability to accelerate healing of full-thickness corneal wounds.\r"

We concluded from gross, light, and scanning electron microscopic examinations that a tissue destructive effect on ciliary body and epithelium was produced by positioning the anterior edge of the probe tip 0.5 to 1.0 mm from the visible limbus using a 5- to 9-W power setting for 0.7 second. An 11-W power setting resulted in extensive loss of anatomic integrity of the ciliary body. Limbal probe placement produced significant iris and lens damage while positioning the probe 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus affected primarily pars plana. Damage to the sclera was not observed using this method of cyclophotocoagulation.\r"

This technique is a rapid, convenient, and reproducible method of permanently recording posterior iris pigment changes. These high-quality video images can then be followed to determine the natural course and the results of therapy in these patients.\r"

This dose reduction was maintained in patients followed up for up to 13 months. Renal and hepatic function were unchanged after the addition of ketoconazole. This drug interaction has the potential to reduce dramatically expenditure on cyclosporin in transplant recipients.\r"
