  ".W": "Overall, there is agreement that the origins of hypertension have a genetic basis. The genetic factors interact with environmental factors that influence expression and intensity of the disorder. As summarized in Table 1, there is evidence from the literature to identify pathways for the development of hypertension in blacks. Organ pathology, characteristic of the clinical phenotypic hypertension, consists of increased peripheral vascular resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy, and, particularly in blacks, nephrosclerosis. In this scheme, an intermediate phenotype is a biochemical or endocrine marker of gene expression that participates in the regulation of blood pressure. Intermediate phenotypic characteristics of essential hypertension include sodium sensitivity, adrenergic activity, cation transport, and endocrine function including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, kallikrein-kinin, and prostaglandin. Another intermediate phenotype to be included in this discussion is insulin resistance. These intermediate phenotypes of cell and subcellular function are regulated by candidate genes. Alternatively, an intermediate phenotype can be expressed in response to another intermediate phenotype. For example, sodium sensitivity could be mediated by the cation transport mechanism of Na,K-ATPase, or insulin resistance could be induced by an elevated level of adrenergic activity. Gene expression of the intermediate phenotype is also modulated by environmental factors such as dietary sodium, potassium, or calcium, and social stresses or patterns of physical activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sustained smooth muscle contraction has been proposed to be regulated by either 1) sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [(Ca2+]i)-dependent myosin phosphorylation or 2) diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C activation. We measured diacylglycerol mass with the diacylglycerol kinase assay and myoplasmic [Ca2+] with aequorin in swine carotid medial smooth muscle. Sustained and significant increases in [Ca2+], myosin light chain phosphorylation, and isometric stress were observed with histamine or endothelin stimulation. Neither stimuli, however, induced significant increases in diacylglycerol mass. Relaxation of histamine-stimulated tissues was induced by removal of histamine or removal of extracellular CaCl2 in the continued presence of histamine. The rate of decline of both [Ca2+] and force was similar in both protocols, suggesting that removal of Ca2+ (without removing the stimulus) was equivalent to removal of the stimulus. These data suggest that [Ca2+]i is the primary regulator of sustained swine arterial smooth muscle contraction, whereas diacylglycerol has, at most, only a minor role.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to determine whether endothelin and \"big endothelin\" are released from aortic strips with endothelium and to examine the effect of thrombin by using a specific radioimmunoassay. Porcine aortic strips with endothelium released immunoreactive endothelin (ir-endothelin) and immunoreactive big endothelin (ir-big endothelin) into the medium in a time-dependent manner. These releases were markedly inhibited by 10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. Expectedly, after removal of endothelium, aortic strips did not release a detectable amount of ir-endothelin and ir-big endothelin. In contrast, thrombin (10 units/ml) significantly stimulated the release of ir-endothelin and ir-big endothelin. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay revealed that the major component of ir-endothelin corresponds to standard endothelin-1 (1-21) and the major component of ir-big endothelin corresponds to standard big endothelin (porcine, 1-39). These results suggest that aortic strips with endothelium release endothelin and big endothelin slowly but continuously into the extracellular space and that these releases can be stimulated by thrombin.\r"

Normal rats were instrumented chronically with femoral artery and vein catheters and pulsed Doppler flow probes simultaneously on the renal and superior mesenteric arteries and the abdominal aorta. Endothelin induced a biphasic response of mean arterial pressure. First, endothelin provoked a sharp hypotension with tachycardia, vasodilation of the hindquarter, and a pronounced decrease in renal and mesenteric blood flows. After this initial response, endothelin induced a dose-dependent increase of mean arterial pressure. Changes in the hindquarter vascular resistance were less pronounced than those in renal and mesenteric vascular resistances. Endothelin (2 nmol/kg) reduced renal flow (-86%) resulting from a vasoconstriction (+1,818%) significantly more pronounced than for the mesenteric vascular bed. In another set of experiments, endothelin (2 nmol/kg) induced an increase in proteinuria, characterized by an increase in excreted albumin and by the appearance of proteins with molecular weights of 20,000-280,000. Renal vascular bed exhibited a pronounced sensitivity to the vasoconstrictive effect of endothelin associated with changes in renal function.\r"

Rats were catheterized, housed in metabolic cages, and maintained on a fixed 6 meq/day sodium intake throughout the experiment with daily measurements including mean arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, urinary sodium excretion, urinary potassium excretion, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and stroke volume. Infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) at rates of 3, 5, or 7.5 pmol/kg/min for 7 days was associated with significant, sustained, and dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and smaller less consistent elevations in total peripheral resistance. Other parameters were unaffected. Similar results were observed in rats receiving endothelin-3 (ET-3), except that a higher dose of ET-3 was required. These results indicate that elevated blood levels of endothelin could produce a maintained hypertension without sodium or water retention and that the hemodynamic basis for the increased mean arterial pressure is similar to that seen in most other forms of experimental and clinical hypertension.\r"

Using these monoclonal antibodies, we developed radioimmunoassays for ET-1 with different specificities. Cross-reactivities with ET-2 ranged from 80% to 100%, and those with ET-3 ranged from 3% to 60%. Patients with essential hypertension (n = 20) showed a significant elevation in the plasma ET-1-LI level compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 12) (30.1 +/- 1.4 pg/ml versus 18.5 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). The plasma ET-1-LI level in hypertensive patients in stages II and III (World Health Organization classification) was significantly higher than that in those patients in stage I. There was no significant correlation between the plasma ET-1-LI level and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.11), diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.13), or age (r = 0.24) in all patients studied who had essential hypertension. In the neutralization experiment, monoclonal antibodies attenuated ET-1-induced contraction of rat aortic rings and the pressor action of ET-1 in pithed rats in vivo. The present study demonstrates the elevated plasma ET-1-LI level in patients with essential hypertension. Monoclonal antibodies developed in this study can become powerful tools to investigate the pathophysiological significance of ET in essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of endothelin, a novel vasoconstrictor peptide, on the adrenergic neuroeffector junction was investigated in isolated perfused mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial sympathetic nerve stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine were determined. Infusion of endothelin-1 increased the baseline perfusion pressure dose dependently to similar extents in the two strains. A subpressor dose of endothelin-1 (10(-10) M) enhanced the pressor response to norepinephrine; its effect was greater in WKY rats than in SHR. Endothelin-1 (10(-12) to 10(-10) M) attenuated the pressor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, and the degree of inhibition tended to be less in SHR than in WKY rats. Higher doses (3 x 10(-10) and 10(-9) M) of endothelin-1 enhanced the pressor response to nerve stimulation in both WKY rats and SHR. Endothelin-1 inhibited norepinephrine release from rat mesenteric arteries; the inhibition was significantly less in SHR than in WKY rats. These results suggest that endothelin enhances the responsiveness of alpha-adrenergic receptors to catecholamines, whereas it inhibits presynaptic adrenergic neurotransmission. Thus, endothelin can interact with the neuroeffector junction in addition to having a vasoconstricting effect in peripheral vessels. The difference in the mode of modulation by endothelin at the vascular neuroeffector junction in SHR from that in WKY rats might explain the maintenance of hypertension.\r"

We have previously shown the presence of a specific, high-affinity, saturable receptor for porcine or human endothelin (ET-1) in cultured calf zona glomerulosa cells. ET-1 was a stimulator of aldosterone secretion although not as powerful as angiotensin II. Incubations of cultured calf zona glomerulosa cells with Sarafotoxin S6b (S6b), a snake venom that has a structure highly homologous to ET-1, stimulated aldosterone secretion with a potency similar to that of ET-1. Binding of [125I]ET-1 to the adrenal receptor gave a Kd of 0.17 +/- 0.05 nM and a Bmax of 36 +/- 8.5 fmol/well (n = 4). Displacement of [125I]ET-1 by unlabeled ETs and S6b showed that the concentrations needed to displace 50% of the tracer were 0.3 nM for ET-1, 0.3 nM for ET-2, 10 nM for S6b, and 100 nM for ET-3. Binding of [125I]S6b to cultured adrenal cells revealed a receptor with a Kd of 0.05 +/- 0.01 nM and a Bmax of 8 +/- 2 fmol/well (n = 4). Displacement of [125I]S6b by unlabeled ETs and S6b showed that the concentrations needed to displace 50% of the tracer were 0.03 nM for S6b, 0.06 nM for ET-1, 0.04 nM for ET-2, and 0.05 nM for ET-3.

Three different dosage regimens of enalkiren were studied: 1) 1.2 mg/kg quotid., 2) 0.3 mg/kg q.i.d., and 3) 0.1 mg/kg q.i.d. Each patient received an intravenous infusion every 6 hours for 1 week. Placebo infusions were used to mimic the 4 times/day dosing schedule. Blood pressure was measured periodically via 24-hour automated monitoring equipment. Mean plasma renin activity in the patient groups ranged from 1.58 to 2.68 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. Plasma renin activity was promptly suppressed in all groups receiving enalkiren. Prolonged duration of plasma renin activity suppression (greater than or equal to 24 hours) was demonstrated after the administration of 1.2 mg/kg enalkiren. The 0.3 mg/kg q.i.d. and 1.2 mg/kg quotid. regimens produced statistically significant reductions (p less than or equal to 0.05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures with clear evidence of persistent antihypertensive activity for 12 hours or more when compared with the placebo group. Despite relatively large reductions in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean pulse rates were essentially unchanged. The prolonged reduction in blood pressure with enalkiren without evidence of tachyphylaxis after 1 week of treatment suggests that renin inhibitors may emerge as useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

In the present study, we characterized the angiotensin II receptor antagonist properties of one such derivative, 4'-([2-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl]methyl)- [1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid (IMI). In receptor binding studies, IMI displaced bound [125I]angiotensin II from rat uterine membranes with an IC50 of 0.17 microM. In isolated rabbit aortic rings, IMI shifted the angiotensin II concentration-response curve to the right in a parallel and concentration-dependent manner. A Schild plot of these data indicated a pA2 of 7.13 +/- 0.16 and a slope of 0.94 +/- 0.06. In rat kidney slices, IMI shifted the concentration-response curve for angiotensin II-induced inhibition of renin release to the right. Antagonism of the angiotensin II pressor response by IMI was dose dependent and reversible in ganglion-blocked, anesthetized rats. The water intake and pressor responses to intracerebroventricular angiotensin II (100 pmol) were inhibited by intracerebroventricular IMI (25 or 50 nmol) in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. Similarly, the drinking and pressor responses to intravenous angiotensin II were blocked by intravenous IMI in conscious rats. IMI alone had no effects on mean arterial pressure or drinking when administered either intravenously or intracerebroventricularly. IMI decreased mean arterial pressure throughout 5 days of infusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In summary, IMI was a full competitive antagonist without partial agonist activity in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Moreover, the chronic administration of this angiotensin II receptor antagonist was antihypertensive in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Vascular sections obtained intraoperatively from 14 normotensive and 16 hypertensive patients undergoing corrective surgery, 68 umbilical cord blood vessels from parturient women, tissue samples from nine explanted hearts, and serum from anephric and healthy individuals were investigated. Ang I-forming angiotensinogenase activities were determined enzyme-kinetically by using Ang I radioimmunoassay and purified sheep or human angiotensinogens. Three nonrenin Ang I-forming angiotensinogenases (pH optima of 4.0, 5.1, and 6.1) were identified in extrarenal vasculature, in cardiac tissues, and in plasma. Highest specific activities of nonrenin Ang I-forming angiotensinogenase (in nanograms Ang I per gram times hour; mean +/- SD) were found in cardiac tissue (2,821 +/- 497, n = 9), followed by carotid artery intima (1,448 +/- 982, n = 10), arteries (1,307 +/- 736, n = 18), and umbilical cord arteries (135 +/- 55, n = 35). Extrarenal arterial Ang I-forming angiotensinogenases were linearly correlated with those of local angiotensin converting enzyme and plasma renin activity. In essential hypertension, extrarenal arterial Ang I-forming angiotensinogenases were scattered, but not generally stimulated. The data obtained indicate the existence of nonrenin Ang I-forming angiotensinogenases in human extrarenal vasculature, in kidney, and in plasma. The postulate of stimulation of extrarenal arterial Ang I-forming angiotensinogenases in essential hypertension cannot be supported. Similar to the classification of plasma renin activity, a classification of Ang I-forming angiotensinogenase activity is proposed, consisting of patients with essential hypertension divided into subgroups exhibiting high, normal, or low vascular Ang I-forming angiotensinogenase activities.\r"

  ".W": "It is well known that diabetes mellitus is often associated with hypertension. We previously reported the unresponsiveness of renin release to volume depletion with impaired renal prostaglandin E2 synthesis in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. However, we have found that BioBreeding Worcester rats, spontaneously susceptible to diabetes mellitus either before or after the onset of diabetes, showed a pronounced fourfold to ninefold increase in plasma renin activity in comparison with control Wistar rats. Furthermore, these rats developed mild hypertension as high as 134 mm Hg after the age of 90 days. The hyperreninemia responded to 1-week sodium loading or restriction; the blood pressure increased during sodium loading. Oral administration of captopril (30 mg/kg) for 1 week resulted in a large blood pressure decrease (-47.1 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, n = 10) in comparison with controls (-17.0 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, n = 12). Vascular response to angiotensin II was also attenuated. Plasma angiotensin II levels were 5.7-fold higher and associated with a 1.5-fold increase of plasma aldosterone concentration compared with control rats, whereas angiotensinogen-plasma concentrations were lower than in control rats. The renal renin content determined enzymatically or histochemically was more enhanced in BioBreeding Worcester rats than in control rats, but the renal renin messenger RNA levels did not differ. These results suggest that the strain-specific hyperreninemia in BioBreeding Worcester rats might be due to posttranscriptional abnormalities of renal renin synthesis. Further work is needed to elucidate the specific mechanism or mechanisms responsible.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether hyperinsulinemia alters angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion, the increase in plasma aldosterone after intravenous angiotensin II (5, 10, and 20 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes each) was measured before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemia in seven chronically instrumented dogs. In a random sequence on 4 successive days, dogs received either 0, 2, 4, or 8 milliunits/kg/min insulin. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, at all insulin doses, resulted in a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) change in the angiotensin II-stimulated increments of plasma aldosterone than was observed when angiotensin II was administered alone. However, there was no dose-dependence of insulin's effect on angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone. The effect of weight gain on the angiotensin II response was also evaluated in five dogs. After weight gain, euglycemic hyperinsulinemia augmented angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone to the same magnitude that was observed before weight gain. Possible mechanisms whereby insulin could increase angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone production include: increased intracellular potassium, reduced plasma free fatty acids, and a direct action of insulin to induce increased adrenal steroidogenesis. In addition to altering the angiotensin II-aldosterone dose-response curve, hyperinsulinemia also increased the pressor action of angiotensin II. In contrast to the angiotensin II-aldosterone response, progressive hyperinsulinemia resulted in a progressive increase in the pressor response to angiotensin II. The increased pressor response is probably due to an increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system by insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine-1 (DA1) receptors in the renal tubules may be involved in the regulation of sodium homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, fenoldopam, a selective DA1 agonist, was infused at 0.05 microgram/kg/min i.v. in 16 normal male subjects in metabolic balance at 300 or 10 meq sodium. Renal function studies were performed by standard p-aminohippurate, inulin, and lithium clearances for three periods: 1) precontrol (2 hours), 2) experimental (3 hours), and 3) postcontrol (2 hours). DA1 receptor stimulation in sodium-loaded individuals increased the following parameters during the experimental period: urine flow rate, from 12.5 +/- 0.4 to 15.5 +/- 0.5 ml/min (p less than 0.05); urinary sodium excretion, from 309 +/- 12 to 489 +/- 18 mu eq/min (p less than 0.001); renal plasma flow, from 631 +/- 19 to 717 +/- 21 ml/min (p less than 0.005); fractional sodium excretion, from 2.2 +/- 0.1% to 3.4 +/- 0.1% (p less than 0.001); fractional lithium excretion, from 26.2 +/- 0.7% to 32.1 +/- 0.8% (p less than 0.005); and distal sodium load, from 10.7 +/- 0.4 to 13.8 +/- 0.5 ml/min (p less than 0.05). The increase in fractional sodium excretion was greater than that of fractional lithium excretion (p less than 0.0001). Distal sodium reabsorption decreased from 78.3 +/- 0.8% to 73.2 +/- 1.1% but the change was not statistically significant. In contrast, sodium-depleted subjects exhibited no significant changes except in renal plasma flow, which rose from 550 +/- 13 to 625 +/- 17 ml/min (p less than 0.0001). Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged through the entire study. These results indicate that diuretic and natriuretic responses are mediated by DA1 receptors at both proximal and distal tubular sites. Attenuation of the DA1 natriuretic response during sodium depletion suggests a direct inhibition of cellular DA1 mechanisms in the renal tubule or recruitment of nondopaminergic compensatory homeostatic mechanisms within the kidney.\r"

Chronic disease, complex pharmacotherapeutic regimens, and psychosocial and physical dysfunction are prevalent in this age group. The dental profession is faced not only with an increase in the number and complexity of older patients, but with the fact that growing numbers of older patients are retaining a greater proportion of their natural dentitions for longer periods. To help meet the need for increased professional skill to deal with these issues, the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services is supporting 23 medical school based geriatrics training programs, designed expressly for physicians and dentists. The programs offer a mixture of experiences in: clinical care of the elderly in a variety of settings; design and conduct of research relevant to geriatric and gerontologic issues; enhancement of pedagogical skills; and program administration. Physicians and dentists share many of the training experiences, providing both groups with unique insights into the presentation and management of their patients' problems, and an enriched awareness of each other's contributions to the care of the elderly.\r"

The number of lymphocytes in each population secreting antibodies reactive with DNA, bromelain-treated mouse RBC, phosphorylcholine and TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin was quantitated by ELISA spot assay. The proportion of B cells secreting Ig in vivo and the repertoire of antibodies they produced varied as a function of B cell phenotype and location. Among peritoneal lymphocytes, those that were Ly-1+ or Ly-1- Mac-1+ secreted Ig 10 times more frequently that Mac-1- Ly-1- B cells from the same location. In addition, the former populations expressed repertoires that were significantly skewed toward the production of antibodies reactive with bromelain-treated mouse RBC (p less than 0.001). In contrast, splenic B cells expressing the Ly-1 surface Ag did not differ significantly from splenic Ly-1- B cells in their expressed repertoire or frequency of Ig production. B cells isolated from the spleen and peritoneum tended to differ in antibody specificity from bone marrow and lymph node-derived lymphocytes. For example, B cells from the spleen secreted anti-DNA antibodies two to four times more frequently than B cells from other organs. These results demonstrate that phenotype and microenvironment influence the repertoire of antibodies expressed by B cells in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90278061\r", 
  ".W": "Functional studies demonstrate that T cell activation often requires not only occupancy of the TCR but costimulatory interactions of other molecules, which remain largely undefined. We have tested the hypothesis that LFA-1 interaction with its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54) (ICAM-1) is such a costimulatory interaction in a model system using biochemically purified ICAM-1 and TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 immobilized on plastic. Resting T cells do not respond to OKT3 mAb immobilized on plastic. However ICAM-1 deposited on plastic together with the nonmitogenic immobilized OKT3 results in a potent activating stimulus. This costimulation cannot be readily accounted for by ICAM-1-mediated adhesion but is consistent with a role in signaling, which is observed in ICAM-1-mediated augmentation of activation induced by PMA/ionomycin. The ability of ICAM-1 to costimulate with immobilized CD3 contrasts with minimal costimulatory activity of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-2, and IL-6. The proliferative response to co-immobilized OKT3 and ICAM-1 is dependent on the IL-2R, which is induced only in the presence of both OKT3 and ICAM-1. The present data demonstrate that LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction is a potent costimulus for TCR-mediated activation; this observation, interpreted in light of previous reports, suggests that LFA-1/ICAM-1 is of major physiologic importance as a costimulatory signal.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 may influence or be influenced by a number of abnormalities present in psoriasis; including keratinocyte proliferation, eicosanoid production, fibroblast activation, endothelial cell adhesiveness, T cell infiltration and activation, cyclic nucleotide metabolism, and transmembrane signal transduction mechanisms. We assessed IL-1 regulation in normal, uninvolved, and involved skin of psoriatic patients using immunofluorescence microscopy, a sensitive ELISA method to quantitate immunoreactive IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha protein levels, the thymocyte proliferation costimulation assay, costimulation of the LBRM.33 IL-1-sensitive cell line, and Northern blotting of cellular RNA to quantitate IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA. IL-1 beta was easily detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy and found to be localized predominantly in epidermal keratinocytes, whereas IL-1 alpha was not detectable with this method. Immunoreactive IL-1 beta was found to be elevated in cytosolic extracts derived from involved psoriatic keratomes relative to keratomes of normal skin. The elevated IL-1 beta protein was accompanied by elevated levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in psoriatic skin relative to normal skin. In contrast, immunoreactive IL-1 alpha levels were markedly reduced in lesional psoriatic skin. In functional assays using both the thymocyte proliferation assay and the LBRM.33 cell line, IL-1 activity from psoriatic involved skin keratomes was markedly reduced relative to that of uninvolved psoriatic keratomes and normal skin. All activity of both normal and psoriatic skin was attributable to IL-1 alpha. The elevated IL-1 beta immunoreactive protein present in psoriatic skin was found to be functionally inactive in these assays. The inactivity of the IL-1 beta was not due to an artifact of the cytosolic method of preparation because IL-1 beta released by psoriatic skin into the media was also nonfunctional. This was in keeping with the demonstration that the IL-1 beta was nonfunctional despite existing as a processed molecule. Taken together, these data demonstrate uncoordinated regulation of IL-1 alpha and Il-1 beta in psoriasis. The profound and complex changes in this system suggest IL-1 dysregulation may be integrally involved in the inflammatory, biochemical, and proliferative processes involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis.\r"

To determine the extent to which these neutralizing antibodies recognize a principal neutralizing determinant in the V3 region of the envelope protein gp120 (amino acids 308-332), one broadly neutralizing serum was fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized peptide columns. Antibodies that neutralize one isolate (HTLV-IIIMN) were substantially but not completely absorbed by the peptide corresponding to a portion of its V3 determinant, whereas the antibodies that neutralize two other isolates (HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIRF) were not absorbed by homologous peptides corresponding to their neutralizing determinants. Neutralizing antibodies also failed to be absorbed by full length envelope protein gp160 and by two other envelope peptides previously reported to be broadly neutralizing epitopes (amino acids 254-274 and 735-752). We conclude that the infected individual had raised a type-restricted neutralizing response targeted at a linear epitope in the V3 region, and that broad neutralization resulted from recognition of epitopes not yet identified.\r"

Several effector cell populations such as mononuclear phagocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, have been reported to produce M-CSF at high levels. We investigated the gene-expression and release of M-CSF in fibroblasts. Quiescent, growth-arrested, fibroblasts showed little expression of M-CSF as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, and little production of M-CSF as measured in the murine bone marrow bioassay. Initiation of proliferation of fibroblasts by fetal bovine serum was followed by an increase in M-CSF transcription and release of the protein. Similarly, single factors (platelet-derived growth factor) or combinations of factors (epidermal growth factor (EGF) + insulin, platelet-derived growth factor + EGF + insulin, or fibroblast growth factor + EGF + insulin) that induced proliferation of the fibroblasts, also induced increased expression of M-CSF. As soon as 1 h after the addition of fetal bovine serum, M-CSF expression was increased, and reached a plateau at 2 to 8 h after induction. IL-1 increased M-CSF expression both in quiescent and proliferating fibroblasts, and induced the expression and release of granulocyte-, and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF. These results show that expression of M-CSF in fibroblasts is not constitutively at a high level, but undergoes regulation depending on the cellular proliferative state and on further activation by acute response proteins such as IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Certain tumor cells generate factors that inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis. Our study was designed to explore whether such factors are produced by K 562 malignant cells and whether these have a broader effect in altering neutrophil functions. After 48 h of in vitro culture of K 562 cells, the culture medium and the cells were separated, lyophilized, and extracted with ethanol. These K 562 products, i.e., either the cell or supernatant extract, inhibited both nonstimulated locomotion and locomotion induced either by FMLP or activated serum. Furthermore, K 562 products inhibited neutrophil adherence and oxidative burst induced by opsonized zymosan, whereas oxidative burst induced by PMA or FMLP was not altered. K 562 products had an inhibitory effect on the PMN binding to iC3b-coated particles. They did not modify Mo1 expression of resting cells, did not alter the up-regulation of the receptor induced by FMLP but inhibited the FMLP-induced capping of Mo1 Ag. Con A capping was also inhibited. Actin polymerization in FMLP-stimulated PMN, as measured by flow cytometry and phalloidin binding to F-actin, was inhibited by K 562 products. The inhibitory factor present in K 562 products (cell and culture supernatant) was purified in three steps including gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and IEF. The eluted active fraction corresponded to single band of about 8 kDa on SDS-PAGE. From these experiments, it is concluded that K 562 malignant cells in culture contain and release a low molecular mass factor (congruent to 8 kDa) that inhibits all adherence-related functions of neutrophils, whereas it does not alter FMLP- or PMA-induced oxidative burst. Further studies are needed to assess whether products of other tumor cells also act on the neutrophil by inhibiting adherence-related functions, Mo1 function and capping, and actin polymerization.\r"

  ".W": "The abundant surface glycolipid, promastigote lipophosphoglycan (LPG), of Leishmania promastigotes was isolated and reconstituted onto the surface of hydrophobic silica beads. These beads bound to both macrophages and monocytes, suggesting that phagocytes possess a receptor(s) capable of recognizing LPG. LPG beads were unable to bind to macrophages isolated from individuals with a genetic deficiency in the CD18 complex of leukocyte integrins (CR3, p150,95, and LFA-1), suggesting that one or more of these receptors were required for binding of LPG. Individual members of the CD18 complex were depleted from macrophages by plating cells on surfaces coated with anti-receptor mAb. These experiments indicated that CR3 and p150,95 from the CD18 complex, were the predominant mediators of attachment of LPG. The phagocyte receptor CR3 expresses two distinct binding sites, one that binds peptide ligands, such as C3bi, and a second site, that recognizes bacterial LPS. Antibody inhibition experiments and competition binding studies with synthetic peptides and soluble LPG indicated that LPG is recognized by the nonpeptide, or \"LPS\" binding site on CR3.\r"

  ".W": "Two populations of Leishmania donovani chagasi promastigotes resistant to the lethal effects of tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, were raised. These parasites exhibited altered patterns of glycosylation when compared to wild-type controls. In particular the major surface glycoprotein gp63 was present in membranes of one population of TM-resistant promastigotes (population 1) primarily in a deglycosylated form, which migrated at a lower Mr than wild-type gp63. The deglycosylated protein was proteolytically inactive on substrate-containing gels, in contrast to glycosylated gp63. Assays of promastigote attachment to human macrophages revealed that, despite a proposed role for gp63 protease activity in binding to macrophage receptors, population 1 TM-resistant promastigotes appeared to attach to the CR3 but not to the mannose-fucose receptor. Control promastigotes bound to both receptors. In contrast, a second population of TM-resistant promastigotes (population 2) did not produce gp63 that could be detected on immunoblots, either in a glycosylated or deglycosylated form. The latter TM-resistant promastigotes bound to neither CR3 nor the mannose-fucose receptor, suggesting that expression of gp63 might be important for promastigotes to bind to CR3. LPG was present in immunoblots of both TM-resistant and control populations suggesting this molecule might not account for the differences in attachment. Surprisingly both TM-resistant promastigote populations contained gp63 mRNA by Northern analysis in apparently equal amounts. We conclude that N-glycosylation is probably necessary for the protease function of gp63, but that neither N-glycosylation nor protease activity of gp63 is necessary for L. donovani chagasi promastigotes to bind to CR3. Furthermore the expression of gp63 protein by TM-resistant promastigotes is dependent upon postranscriptional events.\r"

A number of cell types in the epidermis are capable of secreting cytokines including keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, melanocytic cells, and even Merkle cells. Keratinocytes are the major source of cytokines in the epidermis and have been reported to secrete IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, CSF, TNF alpha, TGF alpha, TGF beta, and PDGF. Normally these cytokines are not actively secreted by keratinocytes; however, a number of agents are capable of mediating keratinocyte cytokine production, including cytokines themselves. We examined the effect of a number of cytokines on keratinocyte IL-1, IL-6, GM-CSF, and PDGF production. It was found that these keratinocyte cytokines are all modulated by one or more cytokines, including several that keratinocytes themselves secrete. These effects appear to be mediated by high-affinity cytokine receptors on keratinocytes. We are only beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the production, regulation, and precise role of keratinocyte cytokines in normal and diseased skin; however, recent studies suggest that cytokines secreted by epidermal cells and lymphoid cells may be important modulators of keratinocyte cytokine production.\r"

  ".W": "Allergic contact dermatitis to poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) is believed to be mediated by T lymphocytes specific for the hapten urushiol. Activated T lymphocytes may produce pathology by a variety of mechanisms including direct cytotoxicity, production of lymphokines, recruitment of non-specific effector cells, non-specific cytotoxicity, and possibly autologous DR reactivity. The regulation and pathogenesis of this condition was studied by cloning and characterizing urushiol-specific T cells from the peripheral blood of patients with poison ivy dermatitis. Multiple CD8+ (T8+) urushiol-specific clones were derived. All clones that proliferated in response to a crude extract of T. radicans also proliferated in response to purified urushiol. Thus, urushiol appears to be the single immunogenic component of T. radicans resin. Pentadecylcatechol (PDC), which differs from urushiol only in the lack of unsaturated bonds in its lipophilic tail, stimulated only one of seven clones tested. This suggests that the double bonds in the C15 lipophilic tail of urushiol are required for antigenicity. Several of the CD8+ urushiol-specific clone suppressed pokeweed mitogen-induced IgG production in the presence of urushiol. Suppression was triggered specifically by urushiol and required MHC compatibility both for the antigen-presenting cells and the responding B cells. These suppressor clones were isolated from convalescent blood and may represent a mechanism for the termination of an allergic contact dermatitis.\r"

CR2, which is found on normal B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid organs, and epithelial cells, interacts preferentially with C3dg, the terminal activation/processing fragment of the third complement component. Attachment of C3dg to CR2 brings complement activators, bearing covalently bound C3dg, into direct membrane contact with CR2-bearing cells. Epstein-Barr virus, a human herpesvirus, also binds to CR2 on B lymphocytes. Attachment of EBV is followed by infection. CR2 has been purified and the binding properties of its ligands analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies have been developed and used to probe the structural correlates of CR2 functions. CR2 has been molecularly cloned and its primary amino acid sequence deduced. These data indicate that it shares characteristic structural features with a number of other complement and non-complement cell membrane and plasma proteins. Several of the complement-associated proteins in this family possess regulatory functions; they are encoded by linked genes which have been localized to band q32 on chromosome 1. CR2 has been expressed in primate and rodent cells by transfection of cDNA in antigenically and functionally intact form. It has also been expressed in soluble form and its structure, electron microscopic appearance and binding characteristics analyzed in detail. The present state of knowledge of the structure and genetics of CR2 and current understanding of its biologic functions are summarized here.\r"

Clinically, this syndrome is manifest as a combined immunodeficiency presenting early in life, and affected individuals are susceptible to a variety of severe and/or opportunistic infections. Chronic, severe diarrhea and malabsorption are also characteristically found, and death is common within the first few years of life. Although the precise molecular lesions responsible for the failure of membrane antigen expression in this syndrome have not yet been identified, the pathogenetic mechanisms involve regulatory defects in the transcription of structural genes encoding for class II antigens. The absence of class II MHC antigens results in profound abnormalities in lymphocyte function and differentiation. Of central importance is the defective MHC-restricted interactions between CD4+ \"helper\" T lymphocytes and the various types of antigen-presenting cells found in the skin and elsewhere. The absence of class II MHC antigens also appears to alter the ability of affected B cells to be activated by a variety of membrane-mediated stimuli, and it profoundly disrupts both the intrathymic development and post-thymic differentiation of immunoregulatory T cells. This \"experiment of nature\" thus demonstrates the critical role of class II MHC antigens in the proper development and function of the immune system.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies directed against C3d,g, a specific 41,000-Da fragment of the third component of complement, bind normal human epidermal basement membrane in a continuous pattern. No such reactivity is present within dermal microvascular basement membranes. By direct immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-human C3d,g antibodies bind the base of the cleavage plane in 1 M NaCl split human skin. By immunoelectron microscopy, anti-human C3d,g reactivity is found along the base of the lamina densa and in the sublamina densa region. Control antibodies directed against human C3, C3c, C5, IgG, IgA, or IgM do not bind normal human epidermal basement membrane or identify in situ deposits of immune complexes in multiple samples of normal human skin that are all positive for C3d,g. Preabsorption of monoclonal or polyclonal anti-human C3d,g antibodies with purified human C3d completely blocks these reagents' epidermal basement membrane reactivity. Studies of skin samples from a patient with congenital C3 deficiency reveal that anti-human C3d,g antibodies do not bind this subject's epidermal basement membrane. Moreover, in vitro treatment of this patient's skin with normal serum, aged serum containing C3d,g, purified human C3, or zymosan-serum reaction mixtures does not restore epidermal basement membrane anti-human C3d,g binding. Studies of other primate tissues demonstrate that C3d,g is not restricted to basement membranes of stratified squamous epithelia as it is also present within renal tubule and glomerular basement membranes. While a recent study has demonstrated that C3d binds laminin in vitro, our investigations show a difference in both the regional and ultrastructural distribution of laminin and C3d,g in normal human skin. Furthermore, C3d,g is absent from laminin-rich basement membranes of papulonodular basal cell carcinomas. These findings suggest that C3d,g is not passively incorporated within selected epithelial basement membranes but rather is a previously unrecognized normal constituent. Basement membrane-associated C3d,g may play a role in adhesive interactions between leukocytes and matrix proteins. Moreover, a C3d,g binding site(s) in selected epithelial basement membranes may account for the accumulation of C3 containing immune complexes in such tissues.\r"

Many ECM receptors, known as integrins, are heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of one alpha and one beta chain. Integrins containing beta 1 or beta 3 chains are ECM receptors, whereas those containing beta 2 chains are leukocyte cell-cell receptors. We have used porcine cutaneous wounds as a paradigm for tissue organization and probed healing wounds and adjacent normal skin with polyclonal antibodies to fibronectin and fibronectin (alpha 5 beta 1) receptor. During re-epithelialization, the epidermis transits over a provisional matrix containing fibronectin. Migrating epidermal cells expressed fibronectin receptors in a bright linear peripheral pattern. At 10 days, when reepithelialization was complete and the basement membrane was re-established, the fibronectin matrix was markedly reduced and fibronectin-receptor expression was limited to the basolateral aspect of basal cells, as observed in normal epidermis. Beneath the migrating epidermis in 5-d wounds, granulation tissue had filled 80% of the wound space. Day-5 wound fibroblasts did not express fibronectin nor other beta 1 integrin receptors, were randomly oriented, and contained no actin bundles. Fibronectin fibrils were assembled on the surfaces of day-5 wound fibroblasts but formed few linkages between cells. Day-7 wound fibroblasts expressed fibronectin receptors, contained peripheral cytoplasmic actin bundles consistent with a contractile fibroblast phenotype, and were coaligned across the wound in parallel array with interconnecting fibronectin fibrils. The wounds contracted between 7 and 10 days. Thus the migrating epidermis consistently expressed fibronectin receptors. Fibronectin receptors were expressed by fibroblasts just prior to wound contraction.\r"

  ".W": "Psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, altered epidermal maturation, and local accumulation of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Keratinocyte hyperplasia in psoriasis may be explained in part by overproduction of growth factors or cytokines which stimulate epidermal proliferation and by altered metabolism of growth-factor receptors in affected skin. Psoriatic epidermis displays overproduction of TGF-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), factors produced by keratinocytes and other cell types in psoriatic skin. TGF-alpha and IL-6 are mitogens for normal human keratinocytes and act via specific receptors. The TGF-alpha receptor (EGF receptor) is overexpressed in psoriatic epithelium and its altered expression could be caused in part by gamma interferon which prevents normal receptor down-regulation in response to EGF binding. Several phenotypic features of the psoriatic keratinocyte, including growth activation and expression of HLA-DR, gamma-IP-10, ICAM-1, and other molecules, are best explained as resulting from the combined effects of TGF-alpha, IL-6, and gamma interferon (and possibly other cytokines) on epidermal keratinocytes. The multiple histologic features of psoriasis, including epidermal hyperplasia and accumulation of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, may be mediated by defined growth factors and cytokines that are produced in psoriatic skin and affect the function of diverse cell types.\r"

The latter are then ligands for their respective receptors on leukocytes, CR3 and CR2. Additionally, CR1 on erythrocytes endows these cells with the capacity to deliver immune complexes (IC) to the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in their clearance from the circulation. On phagocytes, this receptor participates in the process of endocytosis of foreign particles. There is a wide inherited variation of CR1 expression on erythrocytes (CR1/E) of different individuals. Patients with diseases which feature elevated levels of IC, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, leprosy, and AIDS, have a marked decrease of CR1/E, which may result in an altered clearance. This reduction appears to be related to disease activity, and the most probable site for CR1/E loss is during the transfer of IC to macrophages. Healthy neutrophils increase tenfold their expression of CR1 in response to the effect of chemoattractant peptides. Neutrophils from patients with AIDS display an altered response to stimulation. This defect may be of relevance in the process of endocytosis.\r"

Cytokines are small protein molecules produced upon injury or cellular activation which influence immune and inflammatory events; as such, they have been best understood previously as products of leukocytes. The appreciation that cultured non-bone marrow-derived cells from skin could produce cytokines capable of initiating an inflammatory response or facilitating an immune response has led to speculation that cells resident to skin may be less passive participants in such phenomena than previously thought. Using as a model the cultured keratinocyte, which produces both interleukin-1 alpha and beta and an interleukin-1 receptor, models of autocrine and paracrine activation of this cell have been constructed. Such \"activated keratinocytes,\" or by analogy other activated resident skin cells, produce a spectrum of cytokines in vitro which could potentially influence leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, direction migration of leukocytes towards the activated cell (presumably an inflammatory nidus), and activation of leukocyte functions in situ. The putative role of regulation of cytokine and cytokine-receptor regulation in mediating the activation of such cells (and thus, presumably, local inflammation) is discussed. An important aspect of this hypothetical model is that in the absence of activation (which characterizes normal uninflamed skin), cytokine production and its consequences do not occur. The conclusion reached is that based on in vitro data it is plausible to guess that local inflammatory or immune responses can be both initiated and facilitated by locally produced cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for the Fc fragment of immunoglobulins (Fc R) exhibit specificities for a wide variety of immunoglobulin classes and subclasses. In humans, at least three distinct classes of receptors for the Fc fragments of IgG (Fc gamma RI, II, III) and two classes of receptors for the Fc fragments of IgE (Fc epsilon RI, II) have been characterized. These classes were largely defined on the basis of their affinities for different immunoglobulin subclasses and their reactivities with monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies. Among these FcR, in healthy individuals, epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) express only the Fc gamma RII/CDw32. This FcR--a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily--is only present on about 50% of freshly isolated CD1a positive cells, as determined by rosette assays. It has a Mr of 40 kDa, is trypsin resistant, binds polymeric human IgG and murine IgG1-coated erythrocytes, and reacts with anti-CDw32 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). LC internalize Fc gamma RII by receptor-mediated endocytosis. After 48 h of culture, human LC loose their Fc gamma RII, as revealed by flow cytometry. While the function(s) of the Fc gamma RII on human LC remain(s) unknown, this receptor may be primarily involved, like the Fc gamma RII present on mouse macrophages, in the clearance of extra-cellular immune complexes. In patients with atopic dermatitis having an elevated IgE serum level, beside an increased expression of the Fc gamma RII by LC located on lesional skin, IgE-bearing epidermal and dermal LC are present, again essentially on lesional skin. Double immunolabeling on cryosections reveals that on lesional skin only about 50% of the epidermal CD1a positive cells bear IgE. This capacity of LC to bind IgE molecules appears to be due to the presence of a specific Fc epsilon R. While the class of this Fc epsilon R still remains unclear, it appears to have some particularities: i) an associated expression with the CD1a antigen, ii) an affinity for IgG, and iii) a trypsin resistance. In vitro, human recombinant interleukin (IL)-4 and/or interferon (IFN)-gamma are able to induce the synthesis and expression of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on a percentage of normal human epidermal LC. This Fc epsilon RII seems to be functional since it binds IgE molecules, this binding being prevented by preincubation with anti-CD23 MoAb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 1986 it was discovered that cultured human keratinocytes, when treated with gamma interferon, attract and bind T lymphocytes and monocytes. More is now known about trafficking of inflammatory cells in the skin, with specific molecular details involving various cytokines, chemotactic factors, and adhesion molecules. One key element is the in vivo movement of T cells that express LFA-1 into the epidermis, and their subsequent binding to keratinocytes via the surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This interaction represents a common immunologic pathway, which has been identified in a wide variety of different skin diseases. This review provides a synopsis of advances in this field, which have grown rapidly during the past few years, and adds recent results dealing with coordinate regulation at the gene-transcriptional level of keratinocyte chemotactic factor production and adhesion molecule expression. Moreover, epidermal keratinocytes appear to play a pre-eminent role in the skin, serving as transducing elements converting exogenously applied low-molecular-weight chemical stimuli such as phorbol ester and urushiol (the active ingredient in poison ivy extracts) into the production of endogenously derived immunoregulatory proteins. These keratinocyte-derived molecules may then influence immunocytes and endothelial cells to further amplify the inflammatory response. The identification of keratinocyte-derived molecules such as IL-8 and ICAM-1, which influence the chemotaxis and adherence of T cells, adds substantial evidence supporting an active participatory role for keratinocytes in cutaneous immunohomeostasis. Finally, we highlight the importance of these immunoregulatory molecules in two malignant cutaneous disorders (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and basal-cell carcinoma) and attempt to integrate these new findings into novel pathophysiologic models for two inflammatory dermatoses (rhus dermatitis and psoriasis).\r"

  ".W": "In responsive cells, all known effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), and related proteins are mediated through binding to a specific membrane receptor. The EGF/TGF alpha receptor is a single-chain glycoprotein (1186 amino acids) containing three functional domains: 1) an extracellular, glycosylated portion that binds EGF; 2) a small transmembrane portion; and 3) a cytoplasmic portion that has the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and multiple sites that can be phosphorylated. When EGF binds to the receptor its intrinsic tyrosine kinase is activated, resulting in increased phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues both on the receptor (autophosphorylation sites) and on exogenous proteins involved in regulating cellular functions. Site-specific mutagenesis has established that the tyrosine-kinase activity of the receptor is essential for nearly all of the effects of EGF including its ability to elevate cellular calcium levels and to induce DNA synthesis. The binding of EGF and the kinase activity of the receptor are both regulated by the phosphorylation of the receptor on specific threonine/serine sites catalyzed by other protein kinases. Specific lipids such as sphingosine also can regulate kinase activity. Tyrosine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatases and perhaps proteases must be important in terminating the cellular response to EGF. In human skin, the response to EGF/TGF alpha is determined by the location and number of receptors and is modulated by processes affecting the binding affinity, internalization, and tyrosine-kinase activity of the receptor. Specific patterns of EGF binding and of immunoreactive receptors characterize normal growth and differentiation and these are altered during the abnormal growth and differentiation associated with diseases such as psoriasis, viral infections, neoplasms, and paraneoplastic syndromes. It is not clear if the altered patterns reflect the consequence of the disease or are the cause of the disease. As a cause, the EGF receptor may have undetected point mutations that result in internalization and degradation defects, aberrant phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation or abnormal glycosylation.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has emerged as a major systemic alarm signal which appears to be produced by essentially every injured tissue. Recent evidence points to the skin, particularly the injured skin, as one of the major sites of IL-6 production. The hallmark of IL-6 gene regulation is its induction by inflammation-associated cytokines, bacterial products, virus infection, and activation of any of the three major signal transduction pathways (diacylglycerol-, cAMP-, and Ca(++)-activated). Many of these inducers act largely through a 23-bp \"multiple-response element\" in the IL-6 promoter. Different cell types, including keratinocytes, secrete multiple post-translationally modified forms of IL-6. This cytokine, in turn, plays a key role in activating a variety of local and systemic host defense mechanisms that are aimed at limiting tissue injury. Thus, IL-6 elicits major changes in the biochemical, physiologic, and immunologic status of the host (e.g., the \"acute phase\" plasma protein response; activation of B, T, and NK-cell function). IL-6 enhances the proliferation of human keratinocytes and of many B-cell lines but inhibits that of certain carcinoma cell lines; nevertheless, IL-6 can enhance the motility of these carcinoma cells. Elevated levels of IL-6 are observed in human body fluids during acute and chronic infections, neoplasia, autoimmune diseases, and psoriasis and following third-degree burns. It is likely that IL-6 produced by cellular elements in the skin represents an important means of communication between the external environment and the millieu interieur.\r"

  ".U": "90278149\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) was originally identified in 1976 as a growth factor for T lymphocytes. Since that time it has become an important mediator of immune function through its effects on the growth, development, and activity of T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and lymphokine-activated killer cells. Only cells that bear a specific receptor for IL-2 respond to its immunoregulatory effects. Of all the lymphokine-receptor systems in immunology, perhaps most is known about the structure, function, and binding properties of IL-2 and its cognate receptor. There are two distinct, membrane-associated IL-2 binding components in the high-affinity IL-2 receptor: an alpha subunit and a beta subunit, which associate in a non-covalent manner. Each of these polypeptides can occur on the cell surface in the absence of the other and bind IL-2, although with only low or intermediate affinity relative to the high-affinity receptor complex. The primary structure of each chain has now been deduced from full-length cDNA. The rapid rate of association between IL-2 and the IL-2R alpha subunit is important in the formation of high-affinity binding sites, and the inducibility of the alpha gene contributes to the highly regulated and transient display of high-affinity IL-2R. The IL-2R beta chain controls the slow dissociation rate of IL-2 from the high-affinity receptor. Also, IL-2R beta appears centrally involved in internalization of IL-2 and signal transduction, functions mediated presumably through its long intracytoplasmic domain. However, the actual mechanism of signal transduction in the IL-2/IL-2R system remains undefined. IL-2R beta is a member of a novel family of cytokine-receptor proteins that includes receptors for IL-4, IL-6, and erythropoietin.\r"

Our laboratory has investigated the role of specific second messengers in mediating the transcriptional responses of fibroblasts following addition of TGF-beta 1. Our studies indicate that TGF-beta 1, alone and in conjunction with epidermal growth factor (EGF), is capable of stimulating increases in both phosphoinositide metabolism and calcium influx, leading to significant increases in intracellular levels of Ca++ and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). Our data indicated that Ca++ influx and inositol phosphate release are coupled in Rat-1 cells, and suggested that influx of Ca++ from the extracellular medium is required for the change in IP3 accumulation observed in response to both EGF and TGF-beta 1. Using nuclear run-on analysis of the transcription of rat transin, a secreted metalloproteinase homologous to human stromelysin, we have also demonstrated a significant inhibition of transin transcription within 10 min of TGF-beta 1 treatment. The ability of TGF-beta 1 to inhibit transin gene transcription was not related to the TGF-beta 1-induced influx of Ca++ or to an increase in intracellular inositol phosphates, since inhibiting production of these second messengers failed to inhibit repression of the transin gene.\r"

  ".W": "The recirculation of lymphocytes from blood to lymph and back to blood is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system as it facilitates interactions between antigen-reactive clones of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. The first step in the emigration of a blood-borne lymphocyte into either a secondary lymphoid organ or an inflammatory lesion is its adherence to vascular endothelial cells (EC) lining unique post-capillary venules known as high endothelial venules (HEV). Several groups have recently cloned and sequenced genes which may encode organ-specific lymphocyte receptors for the EC of such HEV. The extracellular portion of the putative murine lymphocyte homing receptor for peripheral lymph node HEV is composed of an N-terminal lectin-like domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and then two identical repeating domains which are homologous to a number of complement-binding proteins. A hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail complete the structure. A very similar gene structure has been reported for a cytokine-inducible EC surface protein which is involved in neutrophil-EC adhesion in vitro. In marked contrast, the gene for a putative human lymphocyte homing receptor appears to belong to a gene family which encodes cell-surface molecules with receptor activity for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Similarly, the cell-surface molecule which appears to be the murine lymphocyte receptor for Peyer's patch HEV is homologous, if not identical, to the human VLA-4 molecule, another receptor with binding activity for an ECM protein. It has also been demonstrated that lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) acts in a non-organ-specific manner to mediate lymphocyte-EC adhesion. Finally, other non-organ-specific lymphocyte adhesion molecules for EC may include CD4 and CD8 (which bind to class II and class I MHC antigens, respectively), and CD2 (which binds to LFA-3).\r"

  ".U": "90278152\r", 
  ".W": "IgE binds to two types of Fc receptors, called Fc epsilon R1 (or high-affinity Fc epsilon R) and Fc epsilon R2 (or low-affinity Fc epsilon R). The Fc epsilon R1 is composed of four polypeptide chains, one alpha, one beta, and two gamma chains. The alpha chain contains the IgE binding site and is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family. The Fc epsilon R2, also called CD23, consists of one polypeptide chain which shows homology to animal lectin receptors. Fc epsilon R1 are expressed on mast cells and basophils. Crosslinking of the Fc epsilon R1 induces immediate release of mediators of inflammation such as histamine and leukotrienes and delayed secretion of interleukins 4, 5, and 6. Fc epsilon R2 are expressed on resting mu delta + B cells, monocytes/macrophages (M phi), eosinophils, and platelets but rarely on T cells. Interleukin-4 upregulates Fc epsilon R2 expression on B cells and M phi. The functions of Fc epsilon R2 on the different cell types are not fully established and are controversial. Fc epsilon R2 on M phi, eosinophils, and platelets mediate cytotoxicity to schistosomules, enhance phagocytosis, and induce the release of granule enzymes. However, M phi from patients with atopic dermatitis expressing significantly more Fc epsilon R2 than M phi from normals do not release more leukotriene C4, prostaglandin E2, or beta-glucuronidase after incubation with aggregated IgE than normal monocytes. Furthermore, aggregated IgG1 is much more efficient than IgE in inducing mediator release from M phi and IgG1 antibodies are not known to induce immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, definitive proof that Fc epsilon R2 are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders is still lacking. IL-4 appears to play a central role in immediate-type hypersensitivity. It induces human B cells to secrete IgE and IgG4, Ig isotypes typical for antibodies to helminthic parasites and allergens. IL-4 stimulates mast cell growth and upregulates Fc epsilon R2 expression. Interferon-gamma and IL-2 inhibit the IL-4-induced IgG4 and IgE secretion. Whether the abnormally high IgE antibody production in atopic patients is the result of overproduction of IL-4 or deficient IFN-gamma/IL-2 production is presently unknown.\r"

PDGF was first identified in and purified from human platelet sources. PDGF from platelets is composed of two chains, A-chains and B-chains, which share 60% sequence identity and which can dimerize to form the three combinations PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB. All three dimer forms of PDGF have been isolated from natural sources. Initial studies involving PDGF were based upon the existence of a single cell-surface receptor for PDGF. It has recently been demonstrated that there are two PDGF-receptor subunits, termed alpha and beta, which can associate as three dimer forms (alpha/alpha, alpha/beta, beta/beta) with variable binding specificity for the PDGF ligand dimers. cDNA clones have been obtained for both of the receptor subunits and were shown to code for similar proteins belonging to the split tyrosine kinase family of receptors. The current model of the PDGF receptor subunits proposes that high-affinity binding sites require dimerization of the subunits and that dimerization is associated with activation of the tyrosine kinase of the receptors. The total number of the two receptor subunits and ratio expressed varies between cell types and appears to account for the variable responsiveness of different cell types to the three dimer forms of PDGF.\r"

It mediates a variety of functions that include phagocytosis and regulation of the complement cascade. This receptor has been cloned and the primary structure reveals that the cell-bound molecule is an integral membrane protein with typical transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Its extracellular portion is composed entirely of 30 short consensus repeats (SCR) each having 60 to 70 amino acids. This type of motif is the common structural element of the superfamily of complement regulatory and receptor proteins on chromosome 1. The amino-terminal 28 SCR of CR1 is uniquely organized into four tandem long homologous repeats (LHR) with sequence homologies among corresponding SCR as high as 99%. Each LHR encodes approximately 45 kD and each except the one that is proximal to the cell surface contains a separate binding site for C3b or C4b. Analysis of the genomic structure of CR1 reveals that these LHR are results of intragenic duplication of 20- to 30-kb segments of DNA. The structural allotypes of CR1 that vary in the lengths of the polypeptides are encoded by alleles that contain different numbers of LHR. Their predicted structures would have different numbers of C3b binding sites, perhaps resulting in molecules with different capacities to bind immune complexes.\r"

Molecular cloning studies have revealed that these receptors are identical in protein sequence to the IL-1 receptors on cells of the T-lymphocyte lineage. The functional interleukin-1 receptor on T-cells and fibroblasts is composed of a single polypeptide chain that binds both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. The single chain appears to be all that is required to transduce a signal to cells. While the nature of the signal is unknown, the structure of the receptor is inconsistent with its possessing any protein tyrosine kinase activity. It is therefore not surprising that the mitogenic activity of IL-1 for fibroblasts is mediated by IL-1 induction of PDGF-A gene transcription. Finally, IL-1 is known to modulate fibroblast-matrix interactions in several ways. It is interesting therefore, that the majority of the IL-1 receptors on cultured fibroblasts are clustered into focal adhesions.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectins are widespread extracellular matrix and body fluid glycoproteins, capable of multiple interactions with cell surfaces and other matrix components. Their structure at a molecular level has been resolved, yet there are still many unanswered questions regarding their biologic activity in vivo. Much data suggests that fibronectins may promote extracellular matrix assembly, and cell adhesion to those matrices. However, one outstanding enigma is that fibronectins may, under different circumstances, promote both cell migration and anchorage. An analysis of the interaction of fibroblasts with proteolytically derived and purified domains of plasma fibronectin revealed that the type of adhesion and the correlated cytoskeletal organization depended on multiple interactions of fibronectin domains with the cell surface. Human dermal fibroblasts were capable of interacting with the integrin-binding domain and both heparin-binding domains of the plasma fibronectin molecule and their interactions determined the type of adhesion. The same principle was seen in a study of the ability of plasma fibronectin to promote basement membrane assembly in an endodermal cell line, PF-HR9. There also, interactions of both heparin- and integrin-binding domains combined to promote the deposition of a proteoglycan, laminin, and type IV collagen-containing basement membrane matrix. The underlying conclusion from our studies is, therefore, that fibronectins may, through their different isotypes, multiple receptors, and varying interaction of one or more domains with those receptors, result in a spectrum of responses in different cell types. The molecular details of this array of biologic activities is not resolved but is the target of much current research.\r"

The purpose of this study is to examine normal human skin and cultured human keratinocytes for the presence of SC. Positive staining for SC was found in sections of normal human skin along the basement membrane zone with use of a polyclonal antibody to SC and focally on the surfaces of epidermal cells with use of a monoclonal antibody to SC. Granular cell-surface fluorescence of an intensity far less than that of the positive control HT 29 cells was seen when cultured human keratinocytes were stained for SC by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Study of lysates of both HT 29 cells and HK by immunoblotting have been negative, perhaps due to destruction of the protein or loss of antigenicity during the extraction process. If human keratinocytes are capable of expression of SC, and the receptor can interact with IgA and IgM, this might be a mechanism for protection of the skin from microbial agent or foreign antigens and might be relevant to the deposition of IgA seen in certain skin diseases.\r"

In this paper we review the role of two adhesion pathways, CD2/LFA-3 and LFA-1/ICAM-1, in T-cell interactions with epithelial cells of the thymus and skin. While thymic epithelium-T-cell interactions were mediated by both the LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathway and the CD2/LFA-3 pathway, epidermal-T-cell interactions were mediated primarily by the LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathway. Although ICAM-1 was not expressed in vivo on epidermal keratinocytes in normal skin, ICAM-1 was expressed by epidermal keratinocytes at the site of T-cell infiltration in inflammatory dermatitis. ICAM-1 was expressed in vivo on thymic epithelium. Both LFA-3 and ICAM-1 were expressed on epithelial cells of thymus and skin early on in fetal ontogeny. These antigen-independent adhesion molecules play an important role in the cell-cell interactions associated with T-cell differentiation and function.\r"

In addition, the primary class of cutaneous lymphomas is believed to be of T-cell lineage. All of the antigen and MHC-restriction capabilities are manifested by the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), the study of which has been the primary focus of immunologists for many years. Proper recognition of antigen and MHC-restriction by the TCR is necessary for the activation of the T cell. The analysis of the TCR has proved to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of lymphomas and the study of the normal skin immune system. Recently, TCR subset populations were found to be expressed specifically within the epidermis and have been hypothesized to be important in the maintenance of immunity in the skin immune system. In this article, we discuss the relationship of T cells to the immune system and the importance of the TCR to its function and homeostasis.\r"

These findings and other circumstantial, as well as experimental, evidence suggest that fibrinogen is a powerful, independent cardiovascular risk factor.\r"

  ".W": "The repeated head trauma experienced by boxers can lead to the development of dementia pugilistica (DP)--punch drunk syndrome. The neuropathology of DP in a classic report by Corsellis et al describes the presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles in the absence of plaques, in contrast to the profusion of tangles and plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The DP cases used in that report were re-investigated with immunocytochemical methods and an antibody raised to the beta-protein present in AD plaques. We found that all DP cases with substantial tangle formation showed evidence of extensive beta-protein immunoreactive deposits (plaques). These diffuse \"plaques\" were not visible with Congo-red or standard silver stains. The degree of beta-protein deposition was comparable to that seen in AD. Our data indicate that the present neuropathological description of DP (tangles but no plaques) should be altered to acknowledge the presence of substantial beta-protein deposition (plaques). The molecular markers present in the plaques and tangles of DP are the same as those in AD. Similarities in clinical symptoms, distribution of pathology and neurochemical deficits also exist. Epidemiological studies have shown that head injury is a risk factor in AD. It is probable that DP and AD share common pathogenic mechanisms leading to tangle and plaque formation.\r"

During 1978-86, 51 stereotaxic thalamotomies were performed in 48 patient in our department. Thirty three of these patients had Parkinsonism, nine multiple sclerosis (MS) and the remaining six had various other involuntary movement disorders. The operation was most useful in the Parkinsonian group. Nearly 80% of these patients gained a substantial benefit in their daily lives. Patients with MS were all in advanced stages of the disease, and the operation was tried as a last resort. They had less benefit and more complications from operation than the other patients.\r"

Pulmonary extravascular water volume, measured with this system, was 67% of the gravimetric value (r = 0.91), which was consistent with values obtained from the radioisotope methods. The measured volume was not influenced by changes in cardiac index over a range of 1 to 4 L.min.m2. This system is less invasive than the thermal-dye technique and has potential for repeated clinical measurements of pulmonary extravascular lung water and cardiac output.\r"

Sixty-eight centers contributed 3521 patients in a 2 1/2-year period beginning in December, 1980. Analysis by a prespecified \"planned\" surgery interval demonstrated that there was no difference in early (0 to 3 days after the bleed) or late surgery (11 to 14 days). Outcome was worse if surgery was performed in the 7 to 10-day post-bleed interval. Surgical results were better for patients operated on after 10 days. Patients alert on admission fared best; however, alert patients had a mortality rate of 10% to 12% when undergoing surgery prior to Day 11 compared with 3% to 5% when surgery was performed after Day 10. Patients drowsy on admission had a 21% to 25% mortality rate when operated on up to Day 11 and 7% to 10% with surgery thereafter. Overall, early surgery was neither more hazardous nor beneficial than delayed surgery. The postoperative risk following early surgery is equivalent to the risk of rebleeding and vasospasm in patients waiting for delayed surgery.\r"

In the first 72 hours post-SAH, no increased flow velocities suggestive of arterial narrowing or vasospasm were recorded. There was no significant difference in preoperative flow velocities between the groups. Postoperative flow velocities were significantly lower in patients operated on within 48 hours (p less than 0.001). Two patients, who had surgery on Day 4 post-SAH and who showed the highest recorded postoperative flow velocities, died from cerebral vasospasm and infarction. The results favor a referral system which enables early surgical intervention not only to prevent rebleeds but also aimed at reducing delayed ischemic dysfunction.\r"

Each animal was fitted with a cannula in the left carotid artery while anesthetized with methoxyflurane and was allowed to recover without food for 10-12 h. A resting blood sample was withdrawn, and then each rat received 1 mL of 50% glucose in saline per kilogram body weight throughout the carotid cannula. The cannula was washed with the rat's blood to remove any excess glucose, and blood samples were taken at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after infusion. The 12-mo-old rats in both the high sucrose and sucrose-free diet groups had significantly greater resting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations than did their 27-mo-old counterparts. Diet had no effect on resting glucose or insulin levels. Neither age nor diet had a significant effect on plasma glucose or insulin concentrations following the glucose infusion. These data suggest that the pancreatic response to a glucose load is not altered by age or high sucrose diets.\r"

In cattle, monensin and lasalocid increase apparent digestible energy by an average of 2.0 percentage units. In sheep, responses in digestible energy to ionophore feeding have been more variable, and neither monensin nor lasalocid have, on average, affected digestible energy. The effect of ionophores on fiber digestibility appears to depend on diet composition and source of fiber because both increases and decreases in fiber digestibility have been associated with ionophore feeding. Lasalocid and monensin reduce the percentage of starch digested in the rumen and increase the quantity of starch digested in the intestine. However, total gastrointestinal tract digestion of starch has generally not been affected by ionophores. Apparent nitrogen digestibility has been increased by ionophore feeding in a number of animal species. Apparent absorption of magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and selenium has been increased by ionophore supplementation. Absorption of calcium, potassium and sodium has been inconsistently affected by ionophores. Possible mechanisms whereby ionophores may affect nutrient digestion and absorption are discussed.\r"

Metabolism of volatile fatty acids and glucose by this tissue may limit the availability of essential nutrients to peripheral tissues, and the extent to which this may vary between concentrate-based and forage-based diets is discussed. Factors that affect the development and expression of metabolite uptake by the enterocyte are considered in addition to the influence that manipulation of the microbial flora of the gut by the use of antibiotic growth promoters or probiotics may have upon this process. Data are presented to show that the use of antibiotic compounds in ruminant feeds can influence the rate of cell turnover in the small intestine and the rate of glucose uptake by isolated brush border vesicles.\r"

Liver and gut mass increase approximately 15 and 30 g per unit of liveweight raised to the 0.75 power (Wt0.75) for each multiple of 500 kJ/Wt0.75 [approximately 1 x maintenance (M)] increase in metabolizable energy (ME) intake, with linearity indicated up to the highest recorded level (4.5 x M). Extrapolation from in vivo arteriovenous O2 measurements across splanchnic tissues and from the previously cited weight information indicates that liver and gut tissue oxidize approximately 3.5 and 1.0 kJ of ME/g of fresh tissue daily, in contrast to whole-animal rates of 0.1 kJ/g. Thus, energy use by the relatively small amount of liver and gut accounts for 45 to 50% of whole-animal heat energy. On a differential basis, increases in energy use by these tissues appear to account for up to 70% of the heat increment of ME use above maintenance.\r"

Sixteen patients were randomized to zidovudine and 15 to placebo. We recorded nine scores for each patient during 1 year. During the blinded trial, 3 patients receiving placebo died; at 1 year, one had died in the zidovudine group and 10 in the placebo group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated that mean scores declined less for the zidovudine group than for the placebo group during the blinded trial (p less than 0.03) and during 1 year (p less than 0.002). However, because the QWB incorporates death into its score, these results largely reflected differences in mortality. When data from those who died were excluded, Karnofsky scores were higher for the zidovudine group at the end of the blinded trial (p less than 0.02), but at 1 year no significant differences were observed between groups. The QWB and other quality-of-life measures may contribute to more comprehensive evaluation of AIDS treatments, and may detect treatment effects earlier. Whether existing measures can detect real differences among survivors will require testing in patients with less advanced disease.\r"

The comparison was made to determine which of the malformations reported in the earlier study were commonly detectable on obstetric ultrasound as performed throughout the referral area and to determine what the combined prevalence of those malformations was within the general population. For the comparison, the number of patients undergoing obstetric ultrasound throughout our referral area was estimated from the number of anencephalic fetuses found. The relative prevalences of all malformations in the two groups were then determined by extrapolation. The malformations commonly detectable on ultrasound according to that comparison were then assigned the prevalences obtained from the earlier clinical study. According to this analysis, 0.7-0.8% of fetuses have major malformations commonly detectable on ultrasound, for a rate of 1.2 malformations per 100 fetuses. That represents about 13% of all malformations and about 27% of major malformations. If cardiovascular abnormalities, cleft lip and clubfoot were usually detected, the rate of malformations considered commonly detectable would increase to 2.7 per 100 fetuses. That would represent about 31% of all malformations and about 63% of major ones.\r"

Although the stillborn fetus was delivered by cesarean section, a review of the literature indicated that operative delivery is not indicated when the fetus has died already. Labor and delivery are well tolerated, and an unnecessary hysterotomy is thus avoided. If labor does not ensue spontaneously, it can be induced. Approximately 40% of fetuses will survive the initial injury. In past reviews the risk of prematurity often outweighed the benefits of delivery of those infants. Advances in neonatology now make survival routine after 28 weeks' gestation, and viable fetuses should be delivered promptly by cesarean section to decrease the risk of delayed death from fetal or placental injury.\r"

Comparison of the preoperative sonographic and final pathologic diagnoses revealed a correct sonographic diagnosis in 68% of the cases. In addition, sonography correctly identified a benign condition in 17% of the cases, though without arriving at the exact tissue diagnosis. Sonography was frankly misleading in 15% of the cases, misreading whether the lesions were benign or malignant. The identification of ovarian malignancy was correct in 24/30 patients (sensitivity, 80%), and the specificity for correctly diagnosing a benign condition was 87%. The positive predictive value of a sonographic diagnosis of an adnexal malignancy was 73%. The negative predictive value of sonography for excluding a malignancy was 91%.\r"

The mean duration of indomethacin therapy was 28.3 +/- 18.9 days. The starting dose in all patients was 25 mg orally every six hours. The ductus arteriosus was noted to constrict in four patients, with the development of tricuspid regurgitation in one. One of the constrictions occurred after 23 days of therapy. In one patient with constriction a reduction of the indomethacin dosage was not associated with constriction, while in the other three, constriction was still evident at a reduced dosage. All constrictions and the tricuspid regurgitation resolved in utero within 24 hours after discontinuation of the indomethacin. We recommend careful monitoring of the fetal ductus arteriosus when treating symptomatic polyhydramnios with indomethacin.\r"

  ".W": "A combination of ultrasound and amniocentesis for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) identified 36 anomalous fetuses among 331 pregnant women evaluated at our center for \"true\" elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). In six cases the diagnosis of fetal anomalies was missed on initial ultrasonography. In addition, placental pathology was identified in 12 cases and adverse outcome (fetal demise, intrauterine growth retardation, severe oligohydramnios) in 15. When grouped by multiples of the median (MOM), a significant linear correlation was observed between increasing MSAFP and the rate of fetal anomalies or adverse outcome. The frequency of fetal anomalies increased from 0.93% when MSAFP was less than 3.0 MOM to 56% when MSAFP was greater than 7.5 MOM. No differences were observed in the frequency of placental pathology between the groups. A normal ultrasound study in these patients will decrease considerably, but not eliminate, the risk estimate for undetected fetal anomalies. From our 83% ultrasound sensitivity we calculate that with MSAFP greater than 3.0 MOM the risk of anomalies despite a reassuring scan is greater than 1% and clearly warrants offering amniocentesis for amniotic fluid AFP and ACHE. Between 2.5 and 3.0 MOM the risk is relatively low. Amniocentesis should be offered routinely to patients with MSAFP greater than 3.0 MOM and normal ultrasonography. In patients with MSAFP of 2.5-2.9 MOM and satisfactory ultrasonography the risk of amniocentesis may outweigh its benefits.\r"

Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) permitted reappraisal and staged repair of intra-abdominal pathology, including bowel resection and anastomosis.

Intestinal decontamination with oral antibiotics may improve mortality after burn injury, perhaps due to decreased BT. To determine the effect of oral antibiotic prophylaxis effective against E. coli but not PSA on BT and subsequent mortality in a model of PSA burn wound sepsis, rats were given a 30% scald burn and wound inoculation with 10(8) PSA followed by randomization to either ampicillin (50 mg/kg/d) or saline gavage. Cultures of MLN, organs, blood, and cecal contents were obtained on days 1, 4, and 7 after injury, with additional animals observed for 14-day mortality. Although oral antibiotic prophylaxis resulted in increased cecal colony counts, the incidence of BT was unchanged. The number of organisms present in both the MLN and organs, however, was significantly reduced with prophylaxis, indicating cecal overgrowth by non-translocating bacteria. Reduction of the number of translocating organisms did not result in improved mean survival time after injury, suggesting that mortality from PSA burn wound sepsis occurs independently of bacterial translocation.\r"

The two resections for stenosis were elective; the others were emergent repairs. This gland, readily accessible in the upper mediastinum, is easily dissected from the pleura and pericardium and separated into two lobes. Pedicles based at the thoracic inlet measure between 15 and 20 cm by 4 cm. Each lobe receives independent arterial blood supply and venous drainage which remains intact even if the innominate vein must be divided to effect tracheal repair. All patients survived the perioperative period. The patient with the tracheo-innominate fistula died 1 month later. No patient had evidence of further vascular complications or tracheal anastomotic leak even though one patient developed a long segment of necrotic trachea. Reinforcement following tracheal reconstruction is important in preventing complications from anastomotic leak or vascular erosion. The pedicled thymus gland is an excellent, readily available interposition flap for emergent or elective tracheal reconstruction.\r"

During anaesthesia, for each rise in blood pressure of more than 20% of the preanaesthetic (baseline) value, the patient received 0.1 mg fentanyl. The total amount of fentanyl required per patient was used as an index of the anaesthetic potency of the study gases. Patients in the xenon group required on average only 0.05 mg fentanyl, whereas those in the nitrous oxide group required 0.24 mg fentanyl; the duration of anaesthesia was similar in the two groups. Changes in blood pressure were significantly greater throughout the study in the nitrous oxide than in the xenon group. Thorax-lung compliance fell during the study period in the nitrous oxide group but not in the xenon group. Thus, xenon is a potent and effective anaesthetic which can be safely used under routine conditions.\r"

  ".W": "There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90279839\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed our early experience with the first 26 patients with acoustic neurinomas (21 unilateral, 5 bilateral) treated by stereotactic radiosurgery using the first North American 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 19 months (median, 13 months). Serial postoperative imaging showed either a decrease in tumor size (11 patients) or growth arrest (15 patients). Loss of central contrast enhancement was a characteristic change (18 patients). Seven patients had good or serviceable hearing preoperatively. In all 7 the preoperative hearing status was retained immediately after radiosurgery. At follow-up, 3 had preserved hearing, 1 had reduced hearing, and 3 had lost all hearing in the treated ear. Hearing in 1 patient that was nonserviceable preoperatively later improved to a serviceable hearing level. Delayed facial paresis developed in 6 patients, and delayed trigeminal sensory loss developed in 7 patients, none of whom had significant deficits before radiosurgery. Both facial and trigeminal deficits tended to improve within 3 to 6 months of onset with excellent recovery anticipated. Lower cranial nerve dysfunction was not observed. All 26 patients remain at their preoperative employment or functional status. At present, stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative treatment for acoustic neurinomas in patients who are elderly, have significant concomitant medical problems, have a tumor in their only hearing ear, have bilateral acoustic neurinomas, refuse microsurgical excision, or have recurrent tumor despite surgical resection. Although longer and more extensive follow-up is required, the control of tumor growth and the acceptable rate of complications in this early experience testifies to the future expanding role of this technique in the management of selected acoustic neurinomas.\r"

  ".W": "A limited clinical pilot study involving an amalgam of specialized disciplines including neurology, neuropharmacology, neuropsychology, neurosurgery, neuroanesthesia, neuroradiology, surgical pathology, neuropathology, and urological surgery was organized to clarify issues related to patient selection, optimization of grafting materials, design of a safe, effective, standardized, and reproducible surgical technique, and possible modification of clinical patterns. After initial assessment of 82 Parkinsonian patients for periods of 6 to 20 months, 10 (age, 39-68 years) were selected for unilateral or bilateral adrenomedullary autografts to the caudate nucleus with ependymal and cerebrospinal fluid contact, employing image-directed stereotactic methods. Selection was made only after clear definition of clinical pattern and optimization of medication responses. Adrenal glands were harvested by a retroperitoneal approach (mean estimated blood loss less than 75 ml). Care was taken to maximize the graft content of medullary tissue. Stereotactic methods afforded standardized, reproducible, precise targeting and transit trajectory with unilateral or bilateral placement of materials within the striatum (tissue volume, 80 mm3) with access to the ventricular fluid of the frontal horn. Considerable variability in satisfactory donor medullary tissue was encountered. One patient did not undergo grafting because of unsatisfactory medullary tissue. No significant surgical complications were noted and all patients were ready for discharge 7 days after surgery. One patient who manifested no apparent clinical change died 6 weeks after bilateral grafting of unrelated causes during a lithotripsy procedure. Postmortem examination disclosed precise graft placement with a paucity of structurally preserved medullary cells. Postoperative observations, including parameters of clinical observation, medication schedules and records, patient and family commentaries, and imaging studies (computed tomograms and single photon emission computed tomograms), have been made for periods from 16 to 20 months. Sustained improvement in preexisting clinical patterns and reduction in drug requirements were observed in 4 of 8 patients. No increased benefit could be ascribed to bilateral graft placement. These observations would indicate a safe, and reproducible surgical method. In addition, the clinical observations indicate favorable alterations in the established pattern of the disorder, which would justify further cautious exploration of alternate donor sources or refinements of biological graft site manipulations.\r"

  ".U": "90279850\r", 
  ".W": "Cerebral vascular tone is modulated, at least in part, by the vascular endothelium. This probably results from a balance between the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) and the endothelium-derived constricting factor(s) (e.g., endothelin). The time course of the induction and the decay of these mutually antagonizing substances differ considerably. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is probably involved in rapid changes in vascular tone whereas endothelin may be more important in long-term modulation. We have studied the vasoconstrictor properties of endothelin in human cerebral artery strips. Endothelin typically produced an intense, sustained increae in tone over a dose range similar to that seen with other vasoconstrictor substances such as serotonin and prostaglandin F2 alpha (ED50 = 10(-8) M). The response was resistant to selective antagonists of norephinephrine, serotonin, isoproterenol, histamine, acetycholine, and angiotensin II. Only sodium nitroprusside, verapamil, and a disulfide bond reducing agent (dithiothreitol) inhibited the response. The physiological properties of this response are similar to those of a vasoconstrictor protein found in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The time course of the induction of endothelin production is consistent with the temporal sequence of vasospasm, further supporting the hypothesis that endothelin may be involved in this pathological process.\r"

Two patients exhibited atypical symptoms of proptosis, chemosis, elevated intraocular pressure, and loss of vision secondary to an ethmoidal DAVF, which drained posteriorly to the cavernous sinus. The eighth patient exhibited proptosis and chemosis secondary to a cavernous sinus DAVF and was incidentally found to have an asymptomatic ethmoidal DAVF. One additional patient had two separate dural fistulas: one located on the cribriform plate and the second located in the posterior fossa. Seven of the eight patients were cured by surgical excision of the fistula site; in the remaining patient spontaneous obliteration followed a surgical procedure for a cavernous DAVF. DAVFs involving the floor of the anterior cranial fossa usually present with hemorrhage, but can present with ocular symptoms or be entirely asymptomatic and are effectively treated by surgical excision of the fistula site.\r"

The 3 diagnostic groups consisted of: chronic lower lumbar pain of degenerative musculoskeletal etiology (LLP), post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and pain of non-organic origin in a group with a predominantly psychiatric disorder (PPD). The last group had pain confined to the trunk. All patients documented subjective pain using a visual analogue scale and an 8-item pain descriptor scale. Topical application of capsaicin was used to induce an axon reflex flare in 25 patients with pain and 29 control subjects. Three forms of measurement were used: flare size measured by tracing and by laser Doppler flowmetry, latency to onset of increased skin blood flow and blood flux. The groups with LLP and PHN had reduced flares at the affected site by all 3 measures, whereas no decrease was observed in the PPD group. No significant difference was found between groups when tested on a control site remote from the affected area using the 3 forms of measurement. We suggest that an alteration in the function of capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibers could be related to the subjective report of subacute and chronic pain in diagnostic groups such as LLP and PHN where there is a known organic cause.\r"

Exposure to significantly suprathreshold amounts of capsaicin causes permanent degeneration of C-fibre afferents in adult rats. Functional changes in rats (hypalgesia, diminished neurogenic inflammation) are likely to be a direct consequence of the loss of C-fibre nociceptors, and so are the reductions in neuropeptide levels that follow adult capsaicin treatment. Clinical trials of topical capsaicin treatment for post-herpetic neuralgia have yielded promising results. The selective nature of the action of capsaicin in reducing just C-nociceptor activity may make it particularly useful for treating pain states triggered by C-fibre input.\r"

Half of the infants in each dose group were also randomized to receive either 30 ml of infant formula as buffer before vaccination or were vaccinated on an empty stomach. The incidence of fever, increased stool frequency and decreased activity level was consistently higher among infants who received RRV than those who received placebo. There was no consistent increase in incidence of symptoms as the dose of RRV was increased. Possible vaccine-related side effects were increased in older vaccinees and in those with higher pre-vaccination antibody titers. The seroconversion rate and pre to postvaccination antibody rise, evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by plaque reduction neutralization, correlated well. The 10(5) and 10(4) pfu RRV dose produced significantly higher rates of seroconversion and higher antibody rises than did placebo (P less than 0.001 for 10(5) and P = 0.005 for 10(4]. The 10(3) pfu dose was no more immunogenic than placebo. In the 10(4) pfu dose group 73% of infants receiving formula as a \"buffer\" seroconverted compared with 36% of those not receiving formula; 63% of infants partially breast-fed or formula-fed seroconverted compared with 17% of those exclusively breast-fed. These differences in seroconversion rate were largely overcome by increasing the RRV dose to 10(5) pfu. Stool (copro IgA) antibody responses were examined; of six infants showing a copro IgA response only one had seroconverted based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or plaque reduction neutralization. RRV was recovered by tissue culture more frequently from the stool in those infants who received RRV 10(5) and 10(4) pfu than among those receiving 10(3) pfu or placebo (P less than 0.001).\r"

Changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence on refolding are characterized by four phases. Based on changes in the amplitudes of these phases, as a consequence of quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence by ligands, it is possible to determine the step at which a ligand binds during the refolding process. The results show that either NADP or NADPH binds to the last species formed in a sequence involving three intermediates between the unfolded and native states. Dihydrofolate, on the other hand, binds during the formation of the second observed intermediate. When refolding is performed in the presence of methotrexate, an analogue of dihydrofolate, and NADPH, NADPH binds, as determined from changes in NADPH fluorescence, to the third observed intermediate rather than the last (fourth) species formed. Measurements of the recovery of enzymatic activity during refolding suggest that dihydrofolate also induces NADPH binding prior to the final observed folding phase. These results define more closely the formation of structural domains during the folding of dihydrofolate reductase.\r"

MTAg and the 85-kDa phosphoprotein (pp85) could be reassociated in solution, or on blots, after denaturation with SDS. Results from such experiments focus attention on phosphorylation in controlling intracellular sorting and activation of pp85. Tyrosine phosphorylation seems important for recruitment of pp85 from cytosol to membrane. By blotting, pp85 is substantially cytosolic, whereas that recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody is almost exclusively in membranes. Tyrosine phosphorylation also determined association of pp85 with MTAg. Manipulation of MTAg tyrosine phosphorylation, for example, by expressing MTAg using baculovirus vectors in the absence or presence of pp60c-src, dramatically affects reassociation. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be involved in release of pp85 from MTAg, since vanadate increased its rate of dissociation.\r"

  ".W": "Amplification/overexpression of the human neu protooncogene has been frequently found in human primary breast and ovarian cancers and is correlated with the number of axillary lymph nodes positive for metastasis in breast cancer patients. Identification of the factors controlling transcription of the neu gene is essential for understanding the mechanisms of neu gene regulation and its role in tumorigenicity. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene products are pleiotropic transcription regulators of viral and cellular genes and have been identified as a viral suppressor gene for metastasis. Here we demonstrate that transcription of neu can be strongly repressed by the E1A gene products. The 13S and 12S products of E1A gene are effective at repressing neu transcription and the transcriptional repression requires the conserved region 2 of the E1A proteins. The target for E1A repression was localized within a 139-base-pair DNA fragment in the upstream region of the neu promoter. In addition, competition experiments suggest that the sequence TGGAATG, within the 139-base-pair fragment, is an important element for the E1A-induced repression. These results indicate that E1A negatively regulates neu gene expression at the transcriptional level by means of a specific DNA element.\r"

  ".W": "Previous in vitro studies have established a pre-transfer proofreading mechanism for editing of homocysteine by bacterial methionyl-, isoleucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases. The unusual feature of the editing is the formation of a distinct compound, homocysteine thiolactone. Now, two-dimensional TLC analysis of 35S-labeled amino acids extracted from cultures of the bacterium Escherichia coli reveals that the thiolactone is also synthesized in vivo. In E. coli, the thiolactone is made from homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. One molecule of homocysteine is edited as thiolactone per 109 molecules of methionine incorporated into protein in vivo. These results not only directly demonstrate that the adenylate proofreading pathway for rejection of misactivated homocysteine operates in vivo in E. coli but, in general, establish the importance of error-editing mechanisms in living cells.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of mammalian genes by RNA polymerase II often begins at a specific nucleotide, whose location is determined either by an upstream DNA element known as a TATA box or by an element positioned at the transcription start site called an initiator (Inr). By in vitro analysis of synthetic promoters, we demonstrate here that the TATA and Inr elements are functionally similar and that the Inr is contained between nucleotides -3 and +5 relative to the initiation site. Moreover, we found that a mammalian transcription factor IID (TFIID) protein fraction is required for transcriptional stimulation by an Sp1-dependent activating element placed upstream of either TATA or Inr elements. However, in these assays, the yeast TATA-binding protein, which previously was shown to function similarly to mammalian TFIID, could not efficiently substitute for the mammalian TFIID fraction. These results demonstrate that mammalian TFIID is functionally distinct from the yeast TATA-binding protein and may contain additional subunits or domains that are important for transcriptional activation from some promoters.\r"

(1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 1991-1995]. Images of sequence ladders are obtained on x-ray film with exposure times of less than 30 min, as compared to 40 h required for a similar exposure with a 32P-labeled oligomer. Chemically cleaved DNA from a sequencing gel is transferred to a nylon membrane, and specific sequence ladders are selected by hybridization to DNA oligonucleotides labeled with alkaline phosphatase or with biotin, leading directly or indirectly to deposition of enzyme. If a biotinylated probe is used, an incubation with avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate follows. The membrane is soaked in the chemiluminescent substrate (AMPPD) and is exposed to film. Dephosphorylation of AMPPD leads in a two-step pathway to a highly localized emission of visible light. The demonstrated shorter exposure times may improve the efficiency of a serial reprobing strategy such as the multiplex sequencing approach of Church and Kieffer-Higgins [Church, G. M. & Kieffer-Higgins, S. (1988) Science 240, 185-188].\r"

EPSPs were evoked by stimulation of retinogeniculate axons in the optic tract and/or corticogeniculate axons in the optic radiations; EPSPs from both sources were similar. These EPSPs had one or two components, and the second component had several characteristics of NMDA receptor-mediated events. For example, EPSP amplitude decreased when neurons were hyperpolarized and increased when stimulus frequency was increased; these EPSPs could also be blocked reversibly by application of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). We also studied the influence of NMDA receptors on low-threshold calcium spikes, which are large, voltage- and calcium-dependent depolarizations that are often accompanied by high-frequency action potential discharge. APV blocked synaptically activated low-threshold calcium spikes, but APV had no effect on low-threshold calcium spikes that were elicited by current injection. Therefore, APV does not appear to have a direct effect on the T-type calcium channel that is involved in generation of low-threshold calcium spikes. The voltage and frequency dependence of the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSPs, as well as its ability to trigger low-threshold calcium spikes, provide for complex signal processing in the lateral geniculate nucleus.\r"

  ".W": "A role for the leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.4) has been established for regulating the transport of leucine across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli by the leucine, isoleucine, valine (LIV-I) transport system. This transport system is mediated by interactions of periplasmic binding proteins with a complex of membrane-associated proteins, and transcription of the high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system genes is repressed by growth of E. coli on high levels of leucine. We now report results from sequence comparisons and structural modeling studies, which indicate that the leucine-specific binding protein, one of the periplasmic components of the LIV-I transport system, contains a 121-residue stretch, representing 36% of the mature protein, which displays both sequence and structural similarities to a region within the putative nucleotide-binding domain of leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Early fusion events between ancestral genes for the leucine-specific binding protein and leucyl-tRNA synthetase could account for the similarity and suggest that processes of aminoacylation and transport for leucine in E. coli may be performed by evolutionarily interrelated proteins.\r"

No complex formation could be observed using RNAs with similar secondary structure nor with other human immunodeficiency virus 1 recombinant proteins. Deletion analysis mapped this specific binding to the first 90 nucleotides of this rev-responsive element, which contains a U2 small nuclear RNA homologous region. We propose that the specific binding of rev to its target RNA sequence plays an essential part in releasing an incompletely spliced viral mRNA containing this target sequence to the cytoplasm.\r"

Mixing experiments using different numbers of nude bone marrow cells with or without mature thymocytes (unagglutinated by peanut agglutinin) revealed that engraftment of allogeneic T-cell-depleted bone marrow is T-cell dependent. To ensure engraftment, a large inoculum of nude bone marrow must be supplemented with a trace number of donor T cells, whereas a small bone marrow dose from nude donors requires a much larger number of T cells for engraftment. Marked enhancement of donor type chimerism was also found when F1 thymocytes were added to nude bone marrow cells, indicating that the enhancement of bone marrow engraftment by T cells is not only mediated by alloreactivity against residual host cells but may rather be generated by growth factors, the release of which may require specific interactions between T cells and stem cells or between T cells and bone marrow stroma cells.\r"

Although the role of factor Y in primosome assembly during replication in vitro of bacteriophage phi X174 and plasmid pBR322 DNA is clear, its role in E. coli chromosomal replication is not. To address this issue, the gene for factor Y has been cloned molecularly and its DNA sequence has been determined. The cloned fragment of DNA contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 81.7 kDa. This open reading frame contains amino acid sequences identical to 13 N-terminal amino acids of purified factor Y, as well as to a 10-amino acid internal sequence (from a cyanogen bromide fragment) as determined by gas-phase microsequencing. Expression of the polypeptide encoded by this open reading frame using a bacteriophage T7 transient expression system resulted in the accumulation of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa that comigrated with bona fide factor Y during SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Soluble extracts made from cells overexpressing the product of the putative factor Y open reading frame showed a 2000-fold increase in factor Y activity during bacteriophage phi X174 complementary-strand DNA synthesis in vitro when compared to control extracts. The gene encoding factor Y, which maps to 88.5 min on the E. coli chromosome, has been designated primosome A (priA).\r"

Plasmids in mice that express hybrid insulin transgenes during development can be readily cloned into E. coli strains carrying mutations in two of the MDRS loci, mcrA and mcrB. In mice in which transgene expression is inappropriately delayed into adulthood, plasmids can only be cloned into E. coli that carry mutations in all known MDRS activities.

Three domains important for origin function were identified; one of these is essential and contains an 11-base-pair sequence resembling the canonical ARS core consensus; the second region, deletion of which affects the efficiency of the origin, is located 3' to the T-rich strand of the essential sequence and encompasses several elements with near matches to the ARS core consensus; the third region, containing two OBF1 DNA-binding sites and located 5' to the essential sequence, also affects the efficiency of the ARS. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic OBF1 DNA-binding site can substitute for the entire third domain in origin function. A dimer of the synthetic binding site, fused to a truncated origin containing only domains one and two, restored the origin activity to the levels of the wild-type ARS. The stimulation of origin function by the synthetic binding site was relatively orientation independent and could occur at distances as far as 1 kilobase upstream to the essential domain. Based on these results we conclude that the OBF1 DNA-binding site is an enhancer of DNA replication. We suggest that the DNA-binding site and the OBF1 protein are involved in the regulation of the activation of nuclear origins of replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of endothelins (ETs) with bovine kidney neutral endopeptidase (NEP) resulted in a selective two-step degradation with loss of biochemical activity. The Km of the enzyme indicated high-affinity binding, and hydrolysis was completely inhibited by phosphoramidon. The first step was nicking of the Ser5-Leu6 bond, followed by cleavage at the amino side of Ile19. The nicked peptide exhibited biochemical activities comparable to those of the intact peptide--i.e., binding to the ET receptor, induction of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, and toxicity. The twice-cleaved product was inactive. The sarafotoxins (SRTXs) were more resistant than the ETs to NEP: for example, the half-time for ET-1 was approximately 1 hr, while it was approximately 4 hr for SRTX-b and even higher for SRTX-c. These in vitro findings may indicate a regulatory role of NEP (or similar enzymes) in the physiological inactivation of ETs. They might also help to explain why under certain physiological conditions ETs may be less toxic than SRTXs.\r"

Substitution of Arg-180 of CAP eliminated specificity between G.C, A.T, C.G, and T.A at base pair 5 of the DNA half-site. The effect was position-specific: substitution of Arg-180 did not eliminate specificity between G.C, A.T, C.G, and T.A at base pair 7 of the DNA half-site. We conclude, in agreement with the model for the structure of the CAP-DNA complex [Weber, I. & Steitz, T. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

  ".W": "The c-myc protooncogene has been implicated in control of growth and differentiation of mammalian cells. For instance, growth arrest is often preceded by reduction in c-myc mRNA and gene transcription. To elucidate the mechanisms of control of c-myc gene transcription, we have begun to characterize the interaction of nuclear factors with the 719-base-pair (bp) c-myc regulatory domain, located 1139-421 bp upstream of the P1 start site of the mouse gene. Nuclear extracts from exponentially growing WEHI 231 murine B-lymphoma cells formed multiple complexes in mobility-shift assays. Changes in complex distribution were observed in growth-arrested WEHI 231 cells, and a major site of this interaction mapped to a 21-bp sequence that is similar to the sequences recognized by the NF-kappa B family of proteins. Binding of NF-kappa B-like factors was demonstrated by oligonucleotide competition. Induction of complex formation upon 70Z/3 pre-B- to B-cell differentiation, enhancement of binding by GTP, and detergent-induced release of inhibitor protein suggested that NF-kappa B itself is one member of the family that can bind. Transfection of thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs containing the 21-bp c-myc sequence into Jurkat cells demonstrated increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity upon phorbol ester and phytohemagglutinin treatment. These results suggest the involvement of NF-kappa B-like factors in the regulation of c-myc transcription.\r"

To demonstrate cooperativity, synthetic enhancers were constructed in which Sp1-binding sites were combined with various OTF-1-binding sites that differed in their binding affinities. The ability of these constructions to activate transcription from the human U2 small nuclear RNA promoter was measured. The results showed that an Sp1-binding site stimulated transcription 2-fold when combined with a high-affinity binding site for OTF-1. When combined with a low-affinity OTF-1-binding site, in contrast, a 20-fold stimulation of transcription was observed. The stimulatory effect of Sp1 was moreover influenced by the distance between the Sp1- and OTF-1-binding sites and the functional cooperation was mirrored by the cooperative formation of OTF-1- and Sp1-specific protein-DNA complexes in vitro. We conclude from these results that the functional cooperation between OTF-1 and Sp1 involves physical interactions between the two transcription factors resulting in cooperative binding. The results thus reveal a mechanism by which Sp1 can modulate transcription.\r"

A 120-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing a large region of the murine Hox-2 cluster, including 45 kilobases of sequence upstream of the most 5' gene, was cloned. The DNA sequence of the YAC is unrearranged relative to the genomic map. We have subcloned from the YAC insert a homeobox gene, Hox-2.8, whose homeodolmain is highly related to that of the Drosophila homeotic gene proboscopedia (pb). The expression pattern of Hox-2.8 during embryogenesis extends the trend established by genes from Hox-2.5 to -2.7 of successively anterior domains of expression in the neural tube. We have also subcloned and sequenced from a cosmid the labial (lab)-related Hox-2.9, the most 3' member of the cluster to date. These data lend further support to the idea of a common evolutionary origin of the mouse Hox and Drosophila HOM clusters. The YAC will enable us to construct modified forms of the Hox-2 cluster in yeast and to identify their effect on the phenotype of the animal in transgenic mouse strains.\r"

Furthermore, the total number of mononuclear phagocytes is extremely low in affected mice. Serum, 11 tissues, and different cell and organ conditioned media from op/op mice were shown to be devoid of biologically active colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), whereas all of these preparations from littermate control +/+ and +/op mice contained the growth factor. The deficiency was specific for CSF-1 in that serum or conditioned media from op/op mice possessed elevated levels of at least three other macrophage growth factors. Partial correction of the op/op defect was observed following intraperitoneal implantation of diffusion chambers containing L929 cells, which in culture produce CSF-1 as their sole macrophage growth factor. No rearrangement of the CSF-1 gene in op/op mice was detected by Southern analysis. However, in contrast to control lung fibroblasts, which contained 4.6- and 2.3-kilobase CSF-1 mRNAs, only the 4.6-kilobase species was detected in op/op cells. An alteration in the CSF-1 gene is strongly implicated as the primary defect in op/op mice because they do not contain detectable CSF-1, their defect is correctable by administration of CSF-1, the op locus and the CSF-1 gene map within the same region of mouse chromosome 3, their CSF-1 mRNA biosynthesis is altered, and the op/op phenotype is consistent with the phenotype expected in a CSF-1 deficient mouse.\r"

ACC synthase activity was unambiguously correlated with a 45-kDa protein by two independent methods. Peptide sequences were obtained both from the N terminus after electroblotting and from tryptic peptides separated by reversed-phase chromatography. Mixed oligonucleotide probes were used to screen a lambda gt11 library prepared from RNA of induced pericarp tissue. Putative ACC synthase clones were isolated with a frequency of 0.01%. One of these contained a 1.9-kilobase insert with a single open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 55 kDa. A second, partial cDNA clone was found that differed from the first one in 18% of its bases. Genomic Southern blotting suggests possible tandem organization of the two genes in tomato. The entire coding region was expressed in Escherichia coli and the denatured recombinant polypeptide was used to raise polyclonal antibodies. The antibody preparation both immunoinhibits and immunoprecipitates ACC synthase activity from an enriched tomato extract, confirming the identity of the clone. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the ACC synthase messenger accumulation is coordinated with fruit ripening.\r"

Of 56 patients, 11 had sigmoid diverticulitis confirmed at surgery and 16 by clinical response to medical therapy. CT, performed in all diverticulitis patients, had positive results in 93% (25 of 27). These compared favorably with BE study results, of which 80% (20 of 25) were positive. Neither examination had false-positive results. In the 29 patients who did not have diverticulitis, an alternative diagnosis was made by means of CT in 20, but in only three by means of BE studies. Many of the extracolonic abnormalities recognized at CT were clinically unexpected and necessitated emergency surgery. The excellent sensitivity and specificity of CT coupled with its versatility in the detection of extracolonic disease give it an advantage over contrast enema studies for diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis. CT should be the initial study in acutely ill patients, especially when the clinical features are atypical for sigmoid diverticulitis.\r"

Fragmentation was most effective (probably due to increased cavitation effects) when the shock wave traversed fluid at the point of its impact with a stone. The results suggest that treatment with the patient in the supine or oblique position may produce a better outcome than treatment in the prone position. Buoyant stones exhibited the greatest motion, which was often to-and-fro in nature. Although restricting the size of the mock gallbladder cavity reduced stone motion, maintaining a 1-cm fluid path was beneficial for achieving optimal pulverization.\r"

A 20-gauge needle was percutaneously placed in the liver, and a fiber with a 0.5-cm cladding-stripped tip was inserted. The Nd:YAG laser was fired for 6 minutes at 1-4 W. The early sonographic appearance was recorded, and the US appearance before the pigs were killed was correlated with the gross and histopathologic findings. There were no cases of abdominal bleeding or infection. Mild transient changes in liver function were seen. An initial strong echogenic focus decreased slightly in echogenicity for 10 minutes and then stabilized. Over 1-7 weeks, the 1-cm-diameter lesion decreased in size and developed an echogenic rim that correlated with a peripheral zone of inflammatory repair around a small central cavity and zone of necrosis. US-guided laser ablation of liver tissue is safe in this pig model, and the US appearance corresponds to a process of repair and removal of necrotic liver tissue.\r"

All procedures were successful and effective, and 10 of 11 cholecystostomies were performed within 5-15 minutes. No specific complications occurred. The success, ease, and safety of the procedure indicate primary use of PC for biliary decompression when the intrahepatic bile ducts are minimally dilated or nondilated, because standard transhepatic biliary drainage may be difficult in these cases. Because cannulation of the cystic duct and hence internalization through the tumor may be difficult, PC may be most valuable preoperatively, or before standard percutaneous biliary drainage, or as an alternative to endoscopic drainage. This is a rapid and safe method with which to achieve biliary decompression, especially with minimally dilated or nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts.\r"

Cancers as small as 10 mm in diameter were positive for flow. High-velocity flow was seen only in malignancies; it was observed in four cases and may have been due to arteriovenous shunting. Flow was less readily detected in recurrent tumors; two of seven tumors were weakly positive.

In 88 patients the nodule represented adenocarcinoma. Multicentric adenocarcinoma was present in 19 of these patients (22%). The sensitivity of CT in correctly detecting the presence and location of two or more lesions was 0.63 and 0.68 for two observers, with a specificity of 0.86 for both. The CT appearance of multicentric disease varied from well-defined nodules to ill-defined hazy opacities simulating pneumonitis.

  ".W": "The medical records of 55 fetuses with sonographically diagnosed mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) were reviewed to assess prognosis. Fetuses were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of sonographically detected associated fetal anomalies: 13 had no other anomalies detected (isolated MVM), and 42 had concomitant neural axis and visceral anomalies (nonisolated MVM). Mortality was 83% among fetuses with nonisolated MVM and 38% among fetuses with isolated MVM (P less than .005). If terminated pregnancies are excluded, only one of nine (11%) fetuses with isolated MVM died, compared with nine of 16 (56%) fetuses with nonisolated MVM (P less than .005). There are 15 living children: Nine (60%) are developmentally normal at 6-30 months of follow-up (six had isolated MVM), three (20%) are or are likely to be abnormal, and we were unable to follow up three (20%). Fetal anomalies were missed in 11 of 30 (37%) fetuses with detailed follow-up. However, this would have changed the classification from isolated to nonisolated MVM in only one case. Thus, in 54 of 55 cases (or 29 of 30 cases with detailed follow-up), fetuses were accurately classified as having isolated or nonisolated MVM. The authors conclude that sonographically isolated MVM is associated with a significantly better prognosis than nonisolated MVM, and fetuses can be classified accurately based on prenatal sonograms.\r"

The treatment was successful in 158 of 173 cases (91.3%). Complications were encountered in 17 (9.8%). Most of these occurred during the initial period and were mild and controllable with conservative treatments. There were two deaths (1.2% of patients); one was not related to the procedure. These data suggest that percutaneous treatments are safe and effective even among elderly or high-risk patients with biliary diseases.\r"

Two patients underwent PTA on two occasions, and one patient underwent PTA of each lower extremity, resulting in 25 duplex US imaging pairs at a total of 40 PTA sites. The criterion for significant stenosis on duplex US studies was an increase in peak systolic velocity of at least 100% compared with the velocity in the arterial segment proximal to the lesion (velocity ratio, greater than or equal to 2.0). For 22 paired duplex US studies, pulse volume recordings or ankle-brachial indexes were obtained before and after PTA. After PTA, eight patients had residual high velocity ratios at 12 PTA sites. Only two of these patients had a residual hemodynamic stenosis as determined with post-PTA arteriography, pulse volume recordings, or ankle-brachial indexes. In this study, duplex US that was performed immediately after PTA for evaluation of residual stenosis was frequently misleading.\r"

Of the 71 patients with adequate follow-up, initial endovaginal US demonstrated cardiac activity in 46 embryos and no cardiac activity in 25. Initial endovaginal US failed to demonstrate cardiac activity in five of 40 normal embryos, three with crown-rump lengths of less than 2.0 mm and two, between 2.0 and 3.9 mm. Endovaginal US identified cardiac activity in all 12 normal embryos with crown-rump lengths of 4.0-4.9 mm. The presence of cardiac activity was associated with a 24% risk of spontaneous abortion. In embryos between 2.0 and 4.9 mm in crown-rump length, absent cardiac activity was associated with a 91% risk of abortion. All 17 patients with vaginal bleeding and embryos demonstrating no cardiac activity subsequently aborted. The embryonic yolk sac was absent in 35% of patients who subsequently aborted. Variation outside of the 95% confidence limits of the mean for crown-rump length compared with mean gestational sac diameter and yolk sac diameter was also helpful in predicting an abnormal outcome. Nonvisualization of cardiac activity at endovaginal US in embryos less than 4.0 mm in crown-rump length may be normal and warrants follow-up US examination.\r"

Placentas were obtained from three groups of patients: those prospectively demonstrating one or more placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter on third-trimester sonograms (n = 14), those with risk factors for vascular disease (n = 12), and control patients without risk factors (n = 16). Pathologic analysis demonstrated significantly more infarcts in patients with risk factors than in control patients (17 vs three, P = .047). Of a total of 22 infarcts from all three groups, 19 (86%) were isoechoic to viable placenta and therefore not detected with US. The three infarcts identified with US contained hypoechoic or anechoic foci of fibrin or hemorrhage. Of 26 placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas 23 (88%) were decidual septal cysts or intervillous thrombosis without infarction. The authors conclude that nonhemorrhagic placental infarction cannot be identified with ex utero US and, by inference, that prenatal US is probably insensitive for detection of placental infarction.\r"

Using a criterion of \"perfusion-blood pool mismatch,\" SPECT readers diagnosed 50 of 64 hemangiomas and all five \"nonhemangiomas\" (sensitivity, 78% [95% confidence interval, 0.664 - 0.864]; accuracy, 80% [0.69 - 0.877]). Qualitative analysis of lesion signal intensity on T2-weighted spin-echo MR images allowed readers to diagnose 58 of 64 hemangiomas and four of five nonhemangiomas (sensitivity, 91% [0.814 - 0.96]; accuracy, 90% [0.807 - 0.951]). Because of the significantly higher cost of MR imaging and its inability to categorically differentiate hemangiomas from hypervascular metastases, the authors consider SPECT to be the method of choice for diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. MR imaging should be reserved for the diagnosis of lesions smaller than 2.0 cm and for those 2.5 cm and smaller adjacent to the heart or major hepatic vessels; in such cases MR imaging was found superior to SPECT.\r"

Complications were divided into (1) bile duct injury or ligation and (2) a variety of pathologic fluid collections. Specific lesions were bile duct injury (n = 6), accidental bile duct ligation (n = 12), ductal stricture (n = 12), abscess (n = 11), biloma (n = 7), hematoma (n = 5), infected pancreatic pseudocyst (n = 3), and stones (n = 2). Presenting problems were sepsis, jaundice, and intermittent cholangitis. The patients underwent 104 interventional radiologic procedures including 29 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiograms, 21 percutaneous biliary drainages, 12 balloon dilatations of strictures, drainage of 11 abscesses, 8 bilomas, 5 hematomas, and 3 pancreatic pseudocysts. Stones were removed by baskets in 2 patients; 12 pressure and perfusion studies were performed. One hundred of 104 procedures were successful; there was one failed biliary drainage, one unsuccessful stricture dilatation, one unsuccessful hematoma drainage, and one recurrent biloma. Thirty patients were spared another operation. The percutaneous procedures were beneficial although not curative in 14 of 15 patients who underwent reoperation; in those patients the procedures helped to establish a diagnosis, improve the patient's preoperative status, or serve as a landmark for the surgeon to locate and repair the ligated or injured duct. One patient died after reoperation, a 2.2% mortality rate. Sectional imaging studies combined with interventional radiologic procedures help to diagnose promptly and effectively treat major complications of cholecystectomy. These interventional procedures either cure the complication and obviate reoperation or aid the surgeon by relieving sepsis and jaundice before reoperation and providing an intraoperative guide for bile duct reconstruction.\r"

Patients with pancreatitis-induced diabetes may be extremely sensitive to exogenous insulin, rarely develop ketoacidosis, and rarely exhibit classic diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, or accelerated vasculopathy. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) deficiency has been implicated in the defect of glucose homeostasis found after pancreatitis. This study evaluated intravenous and oral glucose tolerance and insulin response to glucose loading, in the setting of pancreatitis, with and without short-term PP replacement. Dogs (n = 7) underwent pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) and were studied with and without PP infusion (2 micrograms/kg/hr) before PDL and at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 4 months after PDL by means of intravenous and oral glucose tolerance tests. Basal and bombesin-stimulated PP levels at 4 months after PDL were subnormal, verifying PP deficiency in these animals with pancreatitis. PP levels during PP infusion reproduced normal postcibal levels, averaging 897 +/- 40 pg/ml. Glucose tolerance, expressed as the glucose decay constant for the intravenous glucose tolerance tests and as the integrated glucose response for the oral glucose tolerance tests, deteriorated over time and was not improved by acute PP replacement. The integrated insulin response to glucose was not affected by PP. The acute infusion of PP at a dose that reproduces normal postprandial PP levels fails to improve glucose tolerance or augment insulin release in this model of pancreatitis-induced diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "90281241\r", 
  ".W": "We determined the effect of a 15% total body surface (TBS), full-thickness burn on the physiologic, histologic, and oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation changes produced by endotoxin. The endotoxin-burn response was compared with that of endotoxin alone. Twenty-two adult sheep with chronic lung and flank lymph fistulas were studied. In 11 sheep a burn was produced under anesthesia and 3 days later they were given 2 micrograms/kg of endotoxin. Data were also compared with those of control sheep and those that were given burns alone. Circulating conjugated dienes increased with endotoxin alone but remained at baseline with endotoxin and burn injury. The lung lymph flow response was increased significantly in the endotoxin-burn group (sixfold) compared with that of endotoxin alone (fourfold). Histologic quantitation of lung neutrophil count was comparable in both groups 6 hours after injury, although mononuclear cells were much more evident in lungs in the endotoxin-burn group. Lipid peroxidation measured by malondialdehyde was significantly increased in the endotoxin group compared with the endotoxin-burn group, despite the greater increase in lymph flow and lung water in the burned group. Oxygen consumption (VO2) remained constant after endotoxin alone compared with baseline. However, VO2 increased twofold immediately after endotoxin in the endotoxin-burn group. This marked increase was followed by a significant decrease in VO2 from baseline. Flank soft-tissue nonburned increased lung lymph flow twofold to threefold with endotoxin and burn, indicating increased soft-tissue permeability, whereas it remained unchanged with endotoxin alone. Liver malondialdehyde increased from a control of 110 +/- 20 to 210 +/- 80 mmol/gm tissue with endotoxin alone and to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gm tissue with endotoxin and burn. We can conclude that burn injury accentuates both the pulmonary and systemic physiologic response to endotoxin, possibly as a result of mediators released from mononuclear cells already activated in the presence of the burn. The increased lung physiologic response does not appear to be caused by greater oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation, as was seen in the liver with the combined injury.\r"

  ".W": "A case of a primary adenocarcinoma of an ileostomy is reported along with 15 other cases collected from the literature. These rare tumors are seen on the average 24 years after colectomy with ileostomy and in all cases are associated with a past history of ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis. Most of the reported cases of these tumors have appeared in the literature within the past 5 years, suggesting that there is a rising incidence of this disease corresponding to completion of a biologic latency period that began when the Brooke ileostomy was introduced for ulcerative colitis in 1951. In our case a mucinous adenocarcinoma occurred at the ileostomy site 34 years after colectomy. Adjacent to the tumor was mucosa showing colonic metaplasia and focal dysplasia. Subsequent biopsy specimens of the revised stoma showed inflammatory lesions morphologically suggestive of inflammatory (pseudo) polyps. The clinical and morphologic features in this case suggest that there is transition from ileal mucosa to colonic mucosa to colonic dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. Annual evaluation of the ileostomy for colonic metaplasia, inflammatory lesions consistent with ulcerative colitis and dysplasia, is recommended. In the presence of dysplasia, stomal revision is advised. Wide local excision is advised for adenocarcinoma.\r"

Twelve patients with biopsy-proved carcinoma of the prostate were evaluated preoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and transrectal ultrasound of the prostate. The main parameters evaluated were the ability of these two modalities to accurately predict capsular penetration and seminal vesicle involvement in these 12 patients: 10 went on to pelvic lymph node dissections, and 8 had radical retropubic prostatectomies. Thus the preoperative studies could be compared to the pathologic results. Based on our results we believe transrectal ultrasonography is more accurate in the assessment of seminal vesicle involvement and comparable to MRI in determining capsular penetration. Because of the lower cost of ultrasound we believe it to be both an economical and accurate way to preoperatively stage prostate carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The success rate of renal transplantation has improved considerably during the past decade, with substantial improvements in both graft and patient survival. The quality of graft function, however, and not graft survival alone is increasingly determining the standards by which transplantation outcome is being judged. As the demand for kidney transplants continues to rise and transplants are being offered to an ever-increasing number of patients, organs are being sought from new supply pools and efforts are being made to use current resources more efficiently. Improvements in clinical management have allowed short-term complications such as infection and rejection to be better prevented or better diagnosed and treated. Fundamental advances in the understanding of the immunologic processes underlying both allograft rejection and acceptance and the introduction of new immunosuppressive agents have allowed a better use of drug therapy and have moved the goal of acquired transplant tolerance closer to attainment. With improved initial transplant success rates, the long-term transplantation outcome is becoming more important. The role of tissue matching in preventing chronic rejection is becoming more appreciated, and the long-term risks of malignancy, arteriosclerosis, and chronic rejection are being better recognized and managed.\r"

  ".W": "Whether the ST segment shift used to evaluate the presence and severity of myocardial ischemia should include the additional deviation due to decreasing amounts of baseline ST segment elevation was examined in 100 clinically normal subjects and in 124 patients with coronary disease. Exercise ST segment depression was calculated in two ways: as the difference between exercise and resting ST segment depression, but excluding any resting ST elevation (STdep), and as the total ST segment difference or excursion, including any baseline resting ST elevation (STdiff). These values were also used for separate calculation of the maximal ST/heart rate slope and delta ST/heart rate index in each case. Given partition values with matched specificity of 95% in clinically normal subjects, 150 microV of STdep was significantly more sensitive for coronary disease than 220 microV of STdiff (61% [76 of 124] versus 50% [62 of 124], p less than 0.005). Comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the superior test performance of STdep for the identification of coronary disease in this population (area under the curve 0.920 versus 0.869, p = 0.0019). In contrast, detection of three-vessel coronary obstruction by standard ST segment criteria was not affected by definition of ST segment excursion. Substitution of STdiff for STdep did not change the performance of the ST/heart rate slope of the delta ST/heart rate index for either the detection of coronary disease or for the identification of three-vessel coronary obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90282109\r", 
  ".W": "These findings permit the following conclusions on cardiac changes induced by high-performance sports and high levels of training. Sinus bradycardia and AV block can frequently be observed in athletes, but they do not require attention as long as they are asymptomatic or do not produce pauses exceeding 4 seconds. Persistent rather than transient second-degree AV block or Mobitz second- or third-degree AV block is an extremely unusual finding even in athletes and should be considered a sign of organic lesions until proved otherwise. Supraventricular and AV node ectopic beats are not more frequent in athletes than in the general population except for atrial fibrillation. WPW syndrome is of particular importance, since rapid conduction to the ventricle via the accessory AV pathway is possible, especially if there is a tendency toward atrial fibrillation. Likewise caution is required in athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Here hemodynamic deterioration must be anticipated with the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia. Simple ventricular arrhythmias occur among athletes with the same frequency as in the general population, but they usually disappear with exercise. The occurrence of complex ventricular forms of arrhythmia should always prompt cardiologic examination in search of underlying cardiac disease, particularly hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy. The presence of ventricular arrhythmias without evidence of underlying heart disease does not indicate a special or increased risk of sudden cardiac death. A higher incidence of right and/or left ventricular hypertrophy, exercise-reversible ST elevation, and exercise-reversible changes in T waves (T negativity, sharp and/or excessive T waves) can be considered physiologic changes in the ECGs of athletes. These changes correlate closely with the type of sports activity and degree of training and are reversible when the activity is stopped. Horizontal ST segment depression are by contrast very rare in athletes and should always be clarified by cardiologic examination. Exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in athletes is unusual without preexisting heart disease. The cause of sudden cardiac death among athletes less than 40 years of age can be predominantely ascribed to congenital heart diseases (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or coronary anomalies). In athletes more than 40 years of age and with increasing age, coronary heart disease is the most frequent autopsy finding. A corresponding risk stratification should take these partial dangers into account.\r"

  ".W": "A prototype intravascular ultrasound imaging catheter with a 20 MHz transducer was used to obtain 59 cross-sectional images in 14 segments of human atherosclerotic arteries. Three distinct components of the arterial wall were visualized on the ultrasound images: a highly reflective intima, an echolucent media, and a moderately reflective adventitia. Images were obtained at 1 mm increments in vitro and were compared with histologic sections at the same levels. Measurements of the arterial layers showed a close correlation between ultrasound images and histologic sections for the thickness of the intimal plaque (r = 0.91), the media (r = 0.83), and the total wall thickness (r = 0.85). The ultrasound images overestimated the mean intimal and total wall thickness by 0.3 mm and 0.7 mm compared to measurements in histologic sections (p less than 0.001). Intravascular imaging with high-frequency ultrasound is an accurate method for measuring microanatomic arterial dimensions and the extent of atheromatous involvement of the arterial wall. This method could represent an important adjunct to traditional angiographic techniques for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis.\r"

After 1.5 and 48 hours, patency of the infarct-related vessel and the quantitative degree of residual diameter stenosis were studied by selective coronary angiography. Ventriculograms were made to determine the global left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients showing patency at 48 hours were reevaluated angiographically after 3 months. At 1.5 and 48 hours after APSAC administration patent vessels were demonstrated in 65 and 69% of patients, respectively. Mean residual stenosis decreased significantly from 56 +/- 11% at 1.5 hours to 46 +/- 13% at 48 hours (p less than 0.01). Patients not responding to thrombolytic therapy showed significant deterioration of the left ventricular function during the first 48 hours after AMI. Side effects were minor and mainly associated with invasive procedures. Despite adequate oral anticoagulation, angiographically documented reocclusion at 3 months amounted to 28%. Reocclusion, however, was neither associated with clinically documented reinfarction, nor with a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Our study shows that APSAC is an effective thrombolytic agent in AMI but that late reocclusion may occur. Oral anticoagulants appear to be less effective in the prevention of reocclusion in the treatment regimen after thrombolysis.\r"

After the initial administration of both dosages, compared to placebo there were significant reductions in exercise-induced ST-segment depression and significant increases in ischemia-free exercise time at all times of testing. At 12 hours, the 100-mg dosage still amounted to greater than 50% of its maximum and was significantly more marked than the 50 mg dose. Accordingly, the 100-mg dosage can be assumed to confer a longer duration of action. At the end of 3 weeks of long-term treatment, the significant antiischemic effects were not diminished versus those observed after initial administration. There was no evidence of tolerance development with either dosage. The IS-5-MN plasma concentration during long-term administration displayed, within the 24-hour treatment cycle, a clear decrease to low baseline values and a marked 5- to 7-fold increase after the daily dose in accordance with the response known to be prerequisite to successful interval treatment. Thus, the once-daily administration of IS-5-MN SR with dosages of 50 mg and, more markedly, 100 mg, provides effective antiischemic protection throughout the daily period of most physical activities in patients with stable angina pectoris.\r"

Expiratory ablation of diastolic SVC flow mimicking cardiac tamponade was not observed in constrictive pericarditis. Respiratory variation in SVC flow velocities was slight in normal subjects and patients with constrictive pericarditis, increased in patients with hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusions (p less than 0.01) and greatest in patients with cardiac tamponade (p less than 0.01). Quantitative analysis of SVC flow velocity patterns is a useful addition to the echocardiographic evaluation of pericardial disease.\r"

Blood flow through finger and calf increased, sometimes markedly, in 6 of the 9 patients, while vascular resistance decreased.

The dose was increased to 2 tablets per day in the patients whose BP did not reach normal levels. By the end of the study, BP was controlled in 83% of the patients. No significant changes were noted in body weight, heart rate or laboratory values; however, treatment had to be discontinued in 6 patients because of hypokalemia (n = 4) or elevated serum creatinine levels (n = 2). Serum uric acid levels were increased in 5.5% of patients. The rate of adverse effects, as reported by the patients, was low (5%). Thus, this study demonstrates that diuretics, especially the combination of a thiazide diuretic and aldosterone antagonist, remain a safe, effective and economical therapy for patients with mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

The safety and efficacy of various sclerosants has been evaluated in experimental and human studies. However, due to the presence of a large number of variables, conflicting results have been reported. Based primarily on anecdotal experiences, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, ethanolamine oleate, polidocanol, and alcohol appear to be potent and safe sclerosants.

Intrahepatic HBcAg was detected by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Before interferon therapy, the intrahepatic HBcAg was detected almost equally in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The expression of nuclear HBcAg decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) after interferon therapy, irrespective of the outcome for DNA polymerase and/or HBeAg/anti-HBe status. The expression of cytoplasmic HBcAg decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) only in the patients who lost DNA polymerase after treatment, whereas it increased in patients with DNA polymerase and/or HBeAg in the serum. These findings suggested that a shift of intrahepatic HBcAg from the nucleus to the cytoplasm occurred in HBeAg-positive patients with chronic active hepatitis B receiving interferon therapy.\r"

There were 18 staging exams of known neoplasms, and 24 examinations to evaluate possible mass. Forty-three examinations were successful, four failed due to instrument malfunction, and three were technical failures. Among 35 exams for masses, follow-up pathology was available in 21 and confirmed EUS findings in 90%. EUS yielded additional information, not available by other imaging studies, in 60% of successful exams. No complications were seen. The recent literature is reviewed in approximately 2000 patients. We conclude that EUS is an accurate and safe method for evaluating upper gastrointestinal pathology, particularly for staging neoplasms.\r"

Esophageal pH was monitored with an antimony electrode and portable recording unit for 24 h under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. Ranitidine significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) reduced 24-h acid contact time from 11.6% to 6.4%. Reflux episode frequency was also significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) reduced from 82 to 45 episodes per day and from 12 to 2 episodes at night. In contrast, metoclopramide did not reduce 24-h acid contact time or daytime reflux episode frequency, although nighttime episode frequency was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) decreased. Only ranitidine significantly reduced heartburn frequency and severity. We conclude that acute treatment with ranitidine, but not metoclopramide, significantly reduces esophageal acid contact time, reflux episode frequency, and heartburn frequency and severity in patients with gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Treatment of hypertension in diabetics can be complicated by diabetic complications and the potential for adverse effects from selected antihypertensive drugs. A rational approach to antihypertensive therapy in diabetics with or without concurrent diabetic complications incorporates a \"stepped\" approach to therapy that includes alternative step 1 agents (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers) rather than traditional agents (eg, diuretics and beta-blockers). Evolving evidence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reveals that they do not exacerbate complications of diabetes mellitus and also may arrest or slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment algorithms for a stepped approach to the management of the hypertensive diabetic patient are proposed.\r"

The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has provided a class of drugs with a very low side-effect profile. However, single-drug therapy is effective in only about half of hypertensive patients. In the past, diuretics have traditionally been used as the initial or second antihypertensive. Increasingly, diuretic therapy is being avoided, and other antihypertensive combinations are being used. In controlled trials, combination converting enzyme inhibitor-diuretic therapy is effective in about 85% of patients. This synergistic combination allows the diuretic dose to be reduced so that the adverse effects and metabolic complications are minimized. At this time, the combination of converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic provides an ideal choice in terms of efficacy, compliance, side effects, and cost.\r"

Data from 745 vaccinees (93.1%), analyzed at the 7th month of follow-up, showed no significant difference in the seroconversion rates for Betagen (94.4%) vs Heptavax-B (97.3%), but the geometric mean titer of antibody was significantly higher for Heptavax-B (11 833 mIU/L) than for Betagen (4628 mIU/mL). The antibody response of Betagen was significantly and independently related to age and sex, while that of Heptavax-B was related to age only. Reported side effects from both vaccines were minor and mild, with approximately one fourth of all vaccinees reporting at least one side effect. Vaccinees, who had a protective level of antibody at the 7th month, were tested for antibodies at the 12th month. Of those in the Betagen-vaccinated group and those in the Heptavax-B-vaccinated group, 99.0% and 100%, respectively, were still protected.

Five children (16%) achieved bifoveal fusion, 22 (71%) had varying degrees of peripheral fusion, and four (13%) had no detectable binocularity after a mean postoperative follow-up of 2.4 years.\r"

All patients, regardless of the mode of therapy, were treated five times a day until they were healed. The mean time to heal in the oral group was 25.9 days and in the topical group was 25.3 days. Resolution of lacrimation was significantly faster in the oral group (12.1 days versus 27.6 days). The patients on tablets also showed a greater improvement in visual acuity. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in the incidence of recurrences over a three-year post-treatment period. It is concluded that oral acyclovir treatment is an effective alternative to ophthalmic ointment in the management of herpetic disciform keratitis.\r"

Quantitative information on flow velocity is obtained by pulsed Doppler spectral analysis, the colour information being used to choose the vessel of interest. Using this technique the authors examined a patient with an orbital varix previously diagnosed by clinical findings and computed tomography. Dynamic evaluation with real-time direct imaging of flow facilitated the diagnosis of this orbital disorder without the need for any contrast material. This technique may prove to be a useful adjunct to computed tomography for the evaluation of suspected vascular lesions of the orbit.\r"

Other carcinomas may possess choriocarcinomatous elements but only rarely have there been reports of transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder associated with raised germ cell tumour markers, possibly because assays are not routinely performed. We present 3 patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, 2 with metastatic and 1 with locally invasive disease, who had raised levels of germ cell tumour markers. These patients were therefore treated with combination chemotherapy appropriate to such tumours, with excellent results, as shown by clinical improvement and return to normal of tumour marker levels. Recent reports of the association between bladder carcinoma and ectopic synthesis of beta-HCG are reviewed. It was concluded that the production of beta-HCG is probably not rare, but that when it is found, the adoption of an appropriate chemotherapeutic regime may be successful.\r"

Increasing attention has centred on the gut as a reservoir of bacteria (and bacterial endotoxins) that can traverse the intestinal mucosal barrier (a process called 'bacterial translocation') and initiate the septic state. Although the link between haemorrhagic shock and sepsis was recognized decades ago, the full experimental demonstration of this phenomenon is more recent. It was shown to occur in three main settings: physical disruption of the gut mucosa, impaired defence mechanisms and altered gut microbial ecology. Conditions such as haemorrhagic shock, burns, protein malnutrition and sepsis are seen in the severely ill surgical patient or the multiply injured, and are known to cause various combinations of circumstances favourable to bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption. These may play an important role in the mortality of the critically ill.\r"

Postoperative infectious complications occurred in a total of 59 patients (19.0 per cent). There were no major differences between the three treatment groups. Thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection, 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage. Of 202 patients (65.0 per cent) requiring blood transfusion during hospitalization 57 (28.2 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits of 23-36 per cent) developed infectious complications, whereas two non-transfused patients (1.8 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits of 0.2 to 6 per cent; P less than 0.001) developed infectious complications. It is concluded that one single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis in acute and elective colorectal surgery is as protective as a triple dose regimen. The development of infectious complications despite antibiotic prophylaxis is strongly related to blood transfusion.\r"

Fifty patients given a low residue diet and the laxative Prepacol were compared with 50 patients given whole gut irrigation. Significantly more patients suffered from vomiting (P = 0.0005), shivering (P = 0.0062) and nausea (P = 0.031) following irrigation; in two cases the procedure had to be abandoned because of profuse vomiting. Irrigation was less well tolerated by the patients (P = 0.00002) than preparation with Prepacol. On the other hand, the quality of bowel preparation was found to be better (P = 0.0005) after irrigation. On two occasions colonoscopy was not possible following Prepacol preparation because of faecal residue. Patients with a previous colorectal resection showed a similar quality of cleansing to those patients prepared with irrigation. We conclude that Prepacol is as efficient as irrigation for patients who have had a previous colorectal resection because the quality of bowel preparation is as good and the associated patient discomfort is small.\r"

Overall, median (range) blood loss was 91 (3-329) ml for gauze and was significantly reduced by calcium alginate swabs to 72 (2-181) ml (P less than 0.05). Unexpectedly, operation times were also shortened from 45 (17-95) min for gauze to 35 (13-70) min with calcium alginate swabs (P less than 0.02). This reduction in blood loss and operating time was greatest for mastectomy, was still statistically significant for cholecystectomy, but was unimportant in inguinal hernia repair. Calcium alginate haemostatic swabs may become routine in major surgery, particularly where blood loss leads to the need for transfusion.\r"

The patients' distribution and characteristics were similar in the two treatment arms. The objective response rate for etoposide was 7% versus 25.8% for etoposide plus cisplatin (P less than 0.005). Median progression-free survival in etoposide arm was 3.5 months versus 5 months in the combination arm (P = 0.43). The median survival time for etoposide was 6 months compared with 8 months for etoposide combined with cisplatin (P = 0.87). Significantly more nausea/vomiting (P less than 0.005), serum creatinine elevation (P less than 0.005), hearing loss and/or tinnitus (P less than 0.005), peripheral neuropathy (P less than 0.005), leukopenia (P less than 0.025), and anemia (P less than 0.005) occurred in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. No statistically significant difference was recorded between the two arms in terms of performance status changes. In conclusion the addition of high-dose cisplatin to single-agent etoposide significantly increases the chance of obtaining tumor response in advanced non-small cell lung cancer at the cost of an increased toxicity without any significant long-term impact on survival and progression-free survival.\r"

Surgery was a modified radical mastectomy in all cases. The radiation therapy was given with high-voltage techniques and included the chest wall and regional nodes. The dose was 4600 cGy/4 1/2 weeks. Tamoxifen was given at a dose of 40 mg daily for 2 years. The adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 12 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) (or chlorambucil, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [LMF] for patients entered before 1978). At a median follow-up time of 6 1/2 years the recurrence-free survival was significantly better for patients allocated to radiation therapy compared to chemotherapy and for patients allocated to tamoxifen compared to no adjuvant endocrine treatment (P less than 0.01). At 10 years the recurrence-free survival for patients in the RT-TAM, RT, CT-TAM, and CT groups was 63%, 57%, 47%, and 31%, respectively. A significant reduction of treatment failures with tamoxifen was only observed among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. The overall survival difference in favor of patients allocated to radiation therapy or tamoxifen was not significant: the respective survival percentage at 10 years in the RT-TAM, RT, CT-TAM, and CT group was 65%, 62%, 52%, and 50%. The results indicate that postoperative radiation therapy continues to play an important role in the primary management of postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer and that the addition of tamoxifen may further improve the results among ER-positive patients.\r"

Some investigators have concluded that inadequate heparinization was responsible, and further heparin infusion or an increase in dose would have been indicated. However, several investigators (Rao: Thrombosis Research 24:181-186, 1981; Marciniak and Gockerman: Lancet September 17:581-584, 1977; Fisken et al.: Lancet December 10: 1231, 1977; Conard et al.: Thrombosis Research 22:507-511, 1981; Kakkar et al.: Lancet January 12:103-104; Green: Lancet February 16:374, 375; Harborne and Nicolaides: Thrombosis Research 43:657-662, 1986; Bonen et al.: Thrombosis Research 27:123-124, 1982; Blomback et al.: Acta Physiologica Scandinavica 58:306-318, 1963; Holm et al.: Scandinavian Journal of Haematology 35:564-569, 1985; Andersson et al.: Thrombosis Research 34:333-340, 1984) have demonstrated that antithrombin III levels are reduced in patients on intravenous heparin. Both reduced antithrombin III levels and reduced rate of antithrombin inhibition of thrombin at the time of heparin discontinuance may increase the risk of coronary rethrombosis. If this theory is correct, increasing heparin infusion may exacerbate this risk. We propose an investigation that will provide evidence for or against the decreased antithrombin III theory, and in doing so, test an experimental therapy designed to prevent coronary reocclusion upon heparin discontinuance. In a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded study, we will determine whether simultaneous administration of warfarin with heparin initiation provides more time to increase antithrombin III levels and prevent coronary reocclusion upon heparin discontinuance, compared to heparin without warfarin therapy.\r"

The shunting was at the atrial level in 65 patients. Thirty-five of these patients (0.8% of all catheterizations) were not suspected of having any form of congenital heart disease by history, physical examination, chest X-ray, EKG, or echocardiogram. In 19 cases there was no significant oxygen step-up and the diagnosis would have been missed by oximetry. The atrial septum was explored during open heart surgery in 7 patients. Atrial septal defects were detected and closed in all. Four patients had the finding confirmed by echocardiography after the catheterization. Small atrial septal defects are frequently not detected by clinical evaluation, noninvasive testing, or oximetry and are easily detected by the rapid, safe, and accurate method of inspired hydrogen appearance time.\r"

Although the hydrogen inhalation method is said to be much more sensitive in this regard, no previous study has measured its sensitivity. Accordingly, in 15 patients (4 men, 11 women, aged 38 to 67 years) without intracardiac shunting, hydrogen inhalation was performed 1) without and 2) with an artificially created femoral arteriovenous shunt of known size, and cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. For the 15 subjects with cardiac outputs of 3.64 to 8.10 liters/min, shunts of 22 to 248 ml/min were created, so that the shunts ranged from 0.5% to 3.3%. Hydrogen inhalation detected all shunts greater than or equal to 1.3% (Qp/Qs greater than or equal to 1.01). Of the 10 shunts less than 1.3%, it detected 5, with the smallest being 0.7%. Thus, the hydrogen inhalation technique is extremely sensitive in identifying the presence of left-to-right shunting, far more sensitive than the oximetric and standard indocyanine green methods.\r"

Thirty-six were children and 33 were adults. Biopsies were grouped into three stages by light microscopy: exudative stage (25 patients), exudative-proliferative stage (26) and proliferative stage (18). Subepithelial deposits or \"humps\" were present in 59 patients (86%). The frequency of humps was significantly lower at the proliferative stage than that noted in the earlier biopsies (p less than 0.01). Intramembranous, subendothelial and mesangial deposits were shown in 83% to 88% of the patients. The overall frequency of GBM abnormalities was 45%, showing significantly higher frequency in children than in adults (p less than 0.01). Dissolving subepithelial deposits were often present in the foci with GBM abnormalities. The GBM lesions were not related to more severe clinical manifestations or outcomes, but tended to occur more frequently in later biopsies (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that abnormalities of GBM in APGN are more often present than formerly assumed, especially in children, and could be a normal response to subepithelial deposits. The occurrence of these lesions in other types of immune-related glomerulonephritis may be considered along the same lines.\r"

Aortic compliance (expressed as percentage increase in lumen diameter for a pulse pressure of 10 mmHg) was calculated from the characteristic pulse wave velocity deduced from 'foot to foot' transit times of the blood flow pulse over a measured length of aorta. Two continuous wave Doppler ultrasound transducers were used: one insonating the root of the left subclavian artery, the other the abdominal aorta proximal to its bifurcation. Measurements were made after the subject had been supine for 5 min to achieve stable conditions. 2. Transit times were calculated on-line in real-time from the delay between the start of the systolic upstroke in the flow velocity sonograms recorded by the two transducers. 3. Within-visit variation was minimized by measuring over 45 cardiac cycles repeated three separate times and calculating an overall mean value for aortic compliance. A full measurement took 5-10 min. 4. Reproducibility of this overall mean value of aortic compliance was assessed at 1 month in 30 subjects (aged 60 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD) and at 3 months in 23 different subjects (59 +/- 8 years). Aortic compliance values ranged from 0.1 to 2.0%/10 mmHg. 5. The mean paired difference between aortic compliance values was -0.02 between 0 and 1 months, and 0.03 between 0 and 3 months, with respective 95% confidence limits of -0.06 to 0.03 and -0.03 to 0.09 embracing zero, thus not differing significantly from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypoglycaemia had a pronounced effect on the splenic radioactivity, which decreased significantly to a mean of 10 +/- 7% of basal radioactivity at 15 min after the onset of hypoglycaemia. The splenic image completely disappeared at some time after hypoglycaemia in all subjects. 3. The reduction of splenic radioactivity was abolished during non-selective alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine, but was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, or cholinergic blockade with atropine, which suggests that the response of vessels perfusing the spleen is mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "This perspective deals with prediction of overt diabetic nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The role of elevated urinary albumin excretion rate (microalbuminuria) in predicting diabetic nephropathy has been emphasized by new follow-up studies. Development of severe kidney impairment was seen in a large percentage of patients with microalbuminuria, but with more intensive care for diabetic patients, this percentage may be falling. Herein, I analyzed alternatives to microalbuminuria in predicting kidney disease in diabetes. 1) Parental predisposition to hypertension is not seen in all studies and therefore may not be a decisive factor, and it cannot be used in prediction of nephropathy. 2) Prediabetic blood pressure may predict nephropathy in certain non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, but elevated blood pressure seems to develop after early microalbuminuria and is likely to be an aggravating factor in established microalbuminuria in IDDM patients. 3) At the clinical diagnosis of IDDM, diabetic nephropathy cannot be predicted. 4) Glycemic control is poor in normoalbuminuric patients with later development of microalbuminuria, and multiple glycosylated hemoglobin measurements are therefore important. 5) In diabetes, glomerular hyperfiltration is associated with late nephropathy, but it alone cannot be the decisive factor, because hyperfiltration in nondiabetic individuals does not produce kidney disease, according to new long-term follow-up studies. 6) Studies of glomerular structure and ultrastructure have not yet documented predictive values for overt nephropathy, but further studies are in progress. 7) Isolated blood pressure elevation without microabuminuria (probably representing essential hypertension in diabetes) has not been predictive. 8) It is clear that elevation of serum creatinine is a very late and insensitive parameter, occurring only with pronounced proteinuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The same hypothesis must be analyzed when remission occurs in cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated patients. In this study, plasma C-peptide levels were serially measured in the basal state and after stimulation in 219 recent-onset type I diabetic patients; 129 received CsA, and all patients were similarly monitored and insulin treated. The results were analyzed in view of the occurrence of remission. Remission was defined as good metabolic control in the absence of hypoglycemic treatment for greater than or equal to 1 mo. Remission occurred in 44% of the CsA-treated group and lasted for mean +/- SE 10.0 +/- 0.9 mo vs. 21.6% in the non-CsA-treated group with a duration of 4.4 +/- 0.8 mo. Plasma C-peptide levels were initially dramatically lower than normal in both groups in the basal and stimulated states. C-peptide levels increased significantly later, at 3 and 6 mo, in both groups. C-peptide values were proportional to the rates of remission in both groups. In the non-CsA-treated group, C-peptide levels later decreased, and these patients inexorably relapsed to insulin dependency. In contrast, in the CsA-treated group, the initial recovery in insulin secretory capacity was maintained over the 18-24 mo of the study. Furthermore, higher remission rates and longer-lasting remission were obtained in patients who reached higher C-peptide levels at the 3rd mo of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Modifying the rate of absorption has been proposed as a therapeutic principle of specific relevance to diabetes. To demonstrate clearly the metabolic benefits that might result from reducing the rate of nutrient delivery, nine healthy volunteers took 50 g glucose in 700 ml water on two occasions: over 5-10 min (bolus) and at a constant rate over 3.5 h (sipping). Despite similar 4-h blood glucose areas, large reductions were seen in serum insulin (54 +/- 10%, P less than 0.001) and C-peptide (47 +/- 12%, P less than 0.01) areas after sipping, together with lower gastric inhibitory polypeptide and enteroglucagon levels and urinary catecholamine output. There was also prolonged suppression of plasma glucagon, growth hormone, and free-fatty acid (FFA) levels after sipping, whereas these levels rose 3-4 h after the glucose bolus. An intravenous glucose tolerance test at 4 h demonstrated a 48 +/- 10% (P less than 0.01) more rapid decline in blood glucose (Kg) after sipping than after the bolus. Furthermore, FFA and total branched-chain amino acid levels as additional markers of insulin action were lower over this period despite similar absolute levels of insulin and C-peptide. These findings indicate that prolonging the rate of glucose absorption enhances insulin economy and glucose disposal.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of obesity and sex on hepatic insulin metabolism were evaluated in the SHR/Mcc-cp rat. During in situ liver perfusion, insulin clearance rate (CLR) expressed per gram of liver tissue was reduced by 58 and 68% in obese females and males, respectively, compared with lean controls. Male sex resulted in CLR reductions of 46% in lean and 59% in obese animals. Obesity resulted in 50% reduction of insulin-receptor binding to isolated hepatocytes. In both lean and obese animals, male sex also resulted in a decrease of approximately 34% in insulin binding. Scatchard plots indicated that the reduction in insulin binding was primarily due to a decrease in number of cell surface receptors. Receptor-mediated insulin degradation was 40% less in obese than lean animals. Male sex also resulted in 27% less insulin degradation relative to females. Receptor-mediated insulin partitioning between four compartments (cell surface bound, internalized and/or cryptic, degraded, and dissociated or released intact), expressed as a percentage of the initial membrane-bound hormone, did not differ between the animal groups. Thus, male sex and obesity are independently and additively associated with a reduction in hepatic insulin clearance and a decrease in the number of cell surface insulin receptors with a proportional decrease insulin compartmentalization and degradation. This mechanism may partly account for the synergistic effects of male sex and obesity on the degree of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and the predisposition to diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen healthy adult volunteers were studied to define the nature of and threshold for the cognitive dysfunction that occurs during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The P300 cerebral event-related potential is an electrophysiological correlate of cognitive decision-making processes that can be measured in response to either an auditory or visual stimulus. P300 and reaction time (RT) were recorded from a visual stimulus under euglycemic conditions and at plasma glucose concentrations of 3.3 and 2.6 mM during insulin infusion in 10 subjects. Reducing plasma glucose levels to 3.3 mM was not associated with an increase in either the latency or amplitude of the P300 component or a change in RT. However, further lowering of plasma glucose to 2.6 mM resulted in an increase in the latency of P300 and a prolongation in RT. Similar changes were seen for the auditory P300 in experiments performed on 9 additional subjects in which both auditory and visual stimuli were presented. The prolongation of P300 did not correct immediately when plasma glucose was raised to basal levels with intravenous glucose but returned to normal 45-75 min later, after ingestion of a carbohydrate-containing meal. Analysis of another event-related potential, P140 (a measure of the sensory processes), showed no change in response to hypoglycemia. Prolongation of RT paralleled the prolongation of P300 latency, suggesting that motor processes were not altered. Therefore, hypoglycemia appears to induce abnormalities in decision-making processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we used an in vitro islet cell cytotoxicity assay to study the possible role of natural killer (NK) cells and their soluble effector molecules in this disorder. First, the results demonstrated that in vivo treatment of acutely diabetic BB rats with anti-asialogangliosideM1 (an NK cell antiserum) but not with anti-T-lymphocyte antibodies reduces spleen cell cytotoxic activity to islets in vitro. Flow microfluorometry (FMF)-sorting experiments were then used to confirm that the splenic cytotoxic effector cell in acutely diabetic BB rats is a CD8+/CD5- NK cell. Further analysis demonstrated that both FMF-sorted NK cell populations from Wistar-Furth rats and unfractionated spleen cells from athymic nu/nu rats with high intrinsic NK cell activity also exhibit high islet cell cytotoxic activity in vitro. Finally, we found that the kinetics and differential cytotoxic activity of NK cells toward islets in vitro could be mimicked by NK cell culture supernatants containing high levels of NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF). The islet cytotoxic activity of these culture supernatants was specifically inhibited by the addition of anti-NKCF monoclonal antibody. These results demonstrate that NK cells from diabetic and nondiabetic rats are cytotoxic to islet cells in vitro. They further suggest that this cytotoxic effect may be mediated in part through the production and release of soluble factors such as NKCF.\r"

Monocytes from 11 obese hyperinsulinemic subjects, 13 obese hyperinsulinemic NIDDM patients, and 7 nondiabetic control subjects were incubated with A14-125I-labeled insulin for 60 min at 37 degrees C, and intracellular insulin degradation was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total cell-associated insulin (insulin binding) and internalized and degraded insulin were decreased in obese subjects and significantly decreased in obese NIDDM patients compared with nondiabetic control subjects. In NIDDM patients, intracellular insulin degradation was inversely correlated with fasting plasma glucose (P less than 0.01). Eight obese subjects and 9 obese NIDDM patients were restudied after 4 wk of therapy with metformin (850 mg twice a day). Plasma levels of the drug were superimposable in the two groups. Metformin therapy did not change glucose and insulin levels in obese subjects but caused a decrease in blood glucose in obese NIDDM patients. Total cell-associated radioactivity (insulin binding) significantly increased in both groups (P less than 0.01). On the contrary, internalized radioactivity increased (0.83 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.35%, P less than 0.01), and similarly, insulin degradation was enhanced (54.6 +/- 8.9 vs. 74.22 +/- 9.15%, P less than 0.01) only in monocytes from obese NIDDM patients. However, the levels of these parameters were still lower than in control subjects (internalization, 2.94 +/- 0.68%; degradation, 93.03 +/- 3.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similarly, the rates of proinsulin biosynthesis were not altered in islets incubated in 10(-4)-10(-9) M IAPP and 5.5 mM glucose, nor was the rate of conversion of proinsulin to insulin changed at 10(-6) M IAPP. Addition of 10(-5) M IAPP to islets incubated in 11 mM glucose decreased the fractional insulin secretion rate; however, the secretion of newly synthesized proinsulin and insulin was not affected. These data indicate that it is unlikely that IAPP is a physiologically relevant modulator of insulin biosynthesis or secretion.\r"

Migraine without aura may be due to mild focal CBF reduction--too mild to be detected by the available CBF techniques (i.e. 20% or less) and too mild to produce ischemia and aura phenomena. Migraine with aura may be due to focal CBF reduction severe enough to produce ischemia (i.e. 50% or more) and therefore also aura phenomena. The phenomenon termed \"spreading oligemia\" typically seen in CBF studies during migraine with aura, may be an artifact reflecting a gradual decrease of CBF in an area of constant size. The typical \"march\" of the aura symptoms may reflect differences in the ischemic threshold of various neurones leading to dysfunction of more and more neurones as the blood flow gradually decreases. It is concluded that migraine with and without aura may be due to the same disease process--the only difference being the intensity of vasospasm and CBF reduction.\r"

Results are listed in kilounits per liter, equilibrated against the World Health Organization standard for IgE.

Except for orchard-grass pollen, the sensitivity and specificity of CAP were better than that of RAST. There was a highly significant correlation between both tests (r range, between 0.864 to 0.987). CAP competes favorably with RAST and has the advantage of being automated and eliciting results in kilounits per liter.\r"

Effects of bitolterol on airway reactivity diminished significantly more slowly than effects of albuterol in subjects with baseline provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml of histamine (half-life of biologic effect 1.37 versus 0.92 hours; p less than 0.05) but not in subjects with baseline provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 less than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml (half-life of biologic effect of 1.01 versus 1.00 hours; p greater than 0.05).\r"

Thirty-two patients were studied who had symptomatic perennial rhinitis and/or asthma during the fall and winter months and had a positive skin test with house dust or house dust--mite extract. An ENVIRACAIRE room air cleaner was placed in the bedroom for 8 weeks. In a random manner, the active filter was used for 4 weeks and a blank filter for 4 weeks. There was an average 70% reduction in the particulate matter greater than or equal to 0.3 micron with the HEPA filter. In a double-blind design, results were assessed by analysis of the patients' symptom/medication scores and subjective evaluation. For the total study, there was no difference in the total symptom/medication scores or individual symptom scores during the placebo and active-filter periods. Analysis of the last 2 weeks of each filter period in which respiratory infection was absent demonstrated definite differences in total and individual symptoms, suggesting active-filter benefit. Patients' subjective responses also suggested benefit from the filter. The overall impression is that the HEPA filter can reduce allergic respiratory symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibitory drug interactions affecting the metabolism of methylprednisolone (MP) may produce either steroid sparing or adverse effects partly by increasing the exposure time to the steroid. This phenomenon can be mimicked by administering MP in divided doses. Two types of responses were compared after a single MP dose (40 mg bolus) and a divided regimen (20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later) in six healthy male volunteers. The suppression of basophils measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours. The 37.5% reduction in dose produced a 23% overall decreased blood histamine response. A pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of MP after both regimens. A slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of basophil cell return to blood. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of MP of about 5 ng/ml were similar for both regimens. The decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between MP treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of MP values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng/ml. Pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the \"dose-sparing\" effects that were achieved by prolonging MP plasma concentrations. This study supports previous clinical observations that patients may require morning through evening exposure to MP to optimize efficacy while adrenal suppression is being minimized.\r"

Ten atopic men with asthma participated in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects had documented EAR and LAR to house dust-mite extract. Responsiveness to methacholine was measured the day before and the day after a standardized allergen-challenge test. L-648,051 was inhaled in two doses of 12 mg 20 minutes before and 3 hours after the allergen challenge. The response was obtained from FEV1 and flows from maximal (V40m) and partial (V40p) expiratory flow-volume curves. All subjects had an EAR and LAR during placebo therapy, but only a minority demonstrated an increase in methacholine responsiveness of more than one doubling dose. The ratio of V40m to V40p during methacholine challenge was higher than during both EAR and LAR (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between drug- and placebo-therapy periods in baseline function, EAR, LAR, ratio of V40m to V40p, and the allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness (p greater than 0.1). These results indicate that an effective aerosolized leukotriene antagonist in man does not protect against allergen-induced airflow obstruction, despite the evidence of an inflammatory response to allergen challenge. This suggests that either the potency or duration of activity of L-648,051 is limited or that leukotrienes C4 and D4 do not play a causative role in human allergic asthma.\r"

Normal women have balanced patterns of X-chromosome inactivation; that is, in a given population of cells, approximately half of their active X chromosomes are of paternal origin and half of their active X chromosomes are of maternal origin. In contrast, female carriers of these X-linked immunodeficiency disorders have an unbalanced pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in those cell lineages that are affected by the disorder; that is, all the active X chromosomes in affected cell lineages are the X chromosomes that carry the normal allele. Two techniques are available for X-chromosome inactivation analysis. One technique depends on methylation differences between the active and inactive X chromosome, and the other technique uses somatic cell hybrids that selectively retain the active X chromosome. In either case, carrier detection can be performed in individuals from families in which only one member of the family has been affected, since neither of these methods depends on linkage analysis.\r"

  ".W": "The embryogenesis of normal human skin is a complex process involving multiple cell types and developmentally regulated growth factors. The immunohistochemical localization of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF-R) was studied in human fetal skin because this receptor modulates all known actions of EGF and TGF-alpha. EGF-R are present in developing skin as early as the 42nd day of gestation. Immunoreactive EGF-R are present in keratinocytes, endothelial, and skeletal muscle cells. In contrast to normal adult human skin in which the EGF-R are primarily restricted to the basal and immediately suprabasal keratinocytes, the fetal epidermis showed a persistent expression of EGF-R in all cell layers. The absence of EGF-R on the outer, apical surface of periderm cells that are exposed to amniotic fluid was unexpected and may reflect down-regulation of EGF-R by EGF/TGF-alpha or related fetal growth factors present in amniotic fluid. The complex regulation of EGF-R in embryonic hair follicles and sebaceous glands indicates an active and perhaps regulatory role for EGF/TGF-alpha in the development and function of pilosebaceous glands as well as mammalian skin in general.\r"

Various growth factors were examined for effects on normal adult human keratinocyte growth and fibronectin (Fn) secretion for cells cultured in serum-free medium. Accumulation of Fn in the medium of cells growth with H + I + EGF + BPE paralleled growth during the exponential phase and declined as the cells approached confluence. Cells maintained in low Ca++ (0.15 mM) post-confluence and fed daily to prevent cornification continued to accumulate Fn in the medium, while those grown continuously in 1.2 mM Ca++ ceased Fn secretion at confluence. EGF, bFGF, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) stimulated keratinocyte Fn secretion in correlation with literature reports on the ability of these factors to stimulate the migration of these cells. In contrast, despite its marked effects on cell growth, BPE was found to consistently reduce the amount of Fn found in the medium when added to cultures containing either EGF or bFGF. Addition of BPE to cultures containing EGF or bFGF stimulated growth to the same extent, indicating that the effects of BPE on keratinocyte growth are not solely due to its content of bFGF.\r"

  ".W": "In bullous pemphigoid (BP), autoantibodies from most patients recognize a high molecular weight 230-kD epidermal antigen (Ag) by immunoprecipitation. By Western immunoblotting, 50-70% of sera recognize the high molecular weight Ag, but 30-50% recognize a low molecular weight, 180-kD epidermal Ag. We examined the specificities of affinity-purified antibodies against these Ag. Antibodies specific for the 230- and 180-kD Ag were prepared by immunoaffinity against Ag immobilized on nitrocellulose and released by acid glycine. IgG eluted from the 230-kD Ag band retained its specific binding to the 230-kD Ag by immunoblotting, and bound to the epidermal basement membrane zone (BMZ) by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and to hemidesmosomes by indirect immunoelectron microscopy (EM). IgG affinity purified by the 180-kD Ag band bound only the 180-kD Ag in immunoblotting, with no cross reaction to the 230-kD Ag, bound the epidermal BMZ by indirect IF, and also bound to hemidesmosomes in immuno-EM. IgG specific for the 230-kD Ag in immunoblotting immunoprecipitated only the 230-kD Ag, with no apparent precipitation of the 180-kD Ag. Surprisingly, IgG specific for the 180-kD Ag precipitated both the 180- and the 230-kD Ag in immunoprecipitation, and the 230-kD Ag band was much more intense than the 180-kD Ag band. This study shows that apparent cross-reactivity between these Ag by BP autoantibodies can only be detected in native conditions by immunoprecipitation, and cannot be demonstrated using denatured Ag in immunoblotting. The two proteins appear to be distinct Ag, closely associated in the epidermal hemidesmosome, but the exact relationship of these Ag to each other may not be clarified until complete structural data become available.\r"

Eighteen (90%) of 20 BP sera reacted to a 230-kD antigen. Seven (35%) of the sera reacted to a 160-kD antigen. Two of these reacted only to the 160-kD antigen and five also reacted to the 230-kD antigen. Antibodies to the 160-kD antigen were not present in 25 control sera obtained from normal individuals or patients with other bullous diseases. The 160-kD antigen was present in epidermal extracts of four different specimens of normal human skin but not in dermal extracts or extracts of control cells including melanoma, fibroblasts, lung carcinoma, and colon carcinoma. Monospecific sera with antibodies to either the 230-kD or to the 160-kD antigen reacted solely to their respective target antigens, but not to both, in extracts of epidermis that contained both antigens. The 160-kD antigen broke down to a 140-kD fragment, while the 230-kD antigen was unchanged in the absence of protease inhibitors. Western blot affinity purified antibody to the 160-kD antigen bound only to the basement membrane zone on the epidermal side of 1M NaCl split skin. These results indicate that a 160-kD antigen is a normal component of the basement membrane zone of human skin. The antigen is located on the epidermal side of skin split with 1M NaCl. It is a minor BP antigen, antibodies to which are present in some patients with BP.\r"

Most of the PMNL superoxide response evoked by unopsonized hyphae was independent of both Ca++ ions and pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins. To determine whether related regulatory proteins were involved in PMNL activation by unopsonized hyphae, separated PMNL plasma membranes were incubated with GTP and a poorly hydrolyzed, radiolabeled GTP analogue, 5'-guanylylimido-diphosphate, then stimulated. Particulate Candida albicans hyphae and soluble chemotactic peptide induced comparable guanine nucleotide release. In contrast, while unopsonized hyphae caused release, it was considerably delayed, though opsonization discernibly affected neither PMNL attachment nor spreading over hyphal surfaces. This paralleled earlier observations of other delayed responses by intact PMNL to unopsonized hyphae: phospholipase C activation, the rise in cytosolic free Ca++ ions, and actin polymerization.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the value of combining interferon with standard local therapy in the treatment of human papillomavirus infection, 97 patients with anogenital warts were randomized to a short course of either interferon plus podophyllin or podophyllin alone. Interferon alpha 2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) was injected intralesionally and podophyllin resin applied topically to each of three warts once weekly for 3 weeks. Maximal responses occurred within 2 weeks of therapy, and overall there was complete clearance of treated warts in 67% of interferon and podophyllin versus 42% of podophyllin recipients (P less than .05, chi 2). Clearance rates were greater in women, patients with warts of less than or equal to 12 months' duration, and HIV-seronegative patients. Of patients with complete clearance, 67% of interferon and podophyllin and 65% of podophyllin recipients experienced recurrences. Thus, in short treatment courses of anogenital warts, intralesional interferon enhanced the effect of topical podophyllin, and trials of combination therapy using more intensive or prolonged regimens of interferon are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty Escherichia coli strains belonging to nine classic EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli) O:H serotypes from infantile diarrhea were examined for enzyme polymorphism and typed according to their multilocus genotypes. They were further examined for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) patterns by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining, for localized adhesion to HEp2 cells, and for their outer membrane protein (OMP) pattern. A very close relationship was detected among electrophoretic type, O:H serotype, biotype, LPS type, and OMP pattern. Most likely these characteristic EPEC groups (all type I) each represented bacterial clones, and furthermore they could be grouped into two genetically closely related clusters. In each cluster the only phenotypic character that differed among strains was the O antigen, which might suggest that the genetic background for the LPS side chains can be transferred horizontally among EPEC strains. The results support the idea that O:H serotyping is useful for studies of epidemiologic linkages between cases of EPEC diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Human ehrlichiosis, an acute febrile illness caused by Ehrlichia canis or a closely related rickettsial organism, was first identified in 1986. From 1986 through 1988, sera from 85 patients demonstrated a fourfold rise or fall in antibody titer to E. canis. Seven (22%) of 32 patients initially tested during the first week after onset of illness. 17 (68%) of 25 tested during the second week, and all 18 tested during the third week had titers that exceeded the minimum positive titer of greater than or equal to 80. Of the 85 confirmed ehrlichiosis patients, 31 (36.5%) also had indirect fluorescent antibody titers considered diagnostic of infection with Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia typhi, or Coxiella burnetti, but in most these diagnoses were not supported by epidemiologic, clinical, or serologic evidence. These results emphasize that patients suspected of having a tick-borne infection should be tested for antibodies to E. canis as well as for those to other rickettsiae.\r"
