  ".W": "Spontaneous contractions, inhibitory responses produced by electrical field stimulation, and some electrophysiologic properties of circular smooth muscle from normal sigmoid colon and from sigmoid colon of ulcerative colitis patients were compared in vitro using simultaneous recordings of mechanical and intracellular electrical activity. In normal colonic circular muscle obtained from 21 patients, the frequency of spontaneous summation contractions ranged from 3 to 7 per 4 min, whereas in circular muscle from 13 patients with ulcerative colitis, the frequency of these contractions ranged from 1 to 9 per 4 min. Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic relaxation produced by electrical field stimulation was recorded in the majority of circular smooth muscle strips from both normal colon and colon from patients with ulcerative colitis. There were no significant differences in mean resting membrane potential, mean slow-wave frequency, mean maximum slow-wave amplitude, or inhibitory-junction potential amplitudes recorded using circular smooth muscle from both normal colon and colon from patients with ulcerative colitis. There appeared to be a weak association in patients with ulcerative colitis between increasing duration of symptoms and decreasing frequency of spontaneous summation contractions, but there were no associations between the frequency of these contractions and the severity of colonic inflammation, patient age, or the frequency of stools. The mechanism accounting for a wider range in the frequency of summation contractions recorded from colonic circular smooth muscle in ulcerative colitis remains to be determined.\r"

We have postulated that the observed oesophageal dysmotility is a primary phenomenon. Using 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring and the solid bolus oesophageal egg transit test, we evaluated the oesophageal transit of 55 patients, with symptomatic reflux oesophagitis, and 16 healthy volunteers. The transit for the entire oesophagus was significantly prolonged in the patient group. This delay was evident in all three segments of the oesophagus. Amongst the patients, there was significant correlation between the oesophageal transit time and the number of prolonged reflux events. No correlation was found, however, between symptom score or severity of endoscopic oesophagitis and transit time. These results would indicate that the oesophageal dysmotility is an integral part of gastrooesophageal reflux disease, and is more of a cause than an effect.\r"

Patients with anorexia nervosa were tested (1) while underweight and selecting their own diet (10 patients); (2) underweight, but receiving an adequate diet on an inpatient unit (refeeding diet) (12 patients); and (3) under refeeding diet conditions after weight gain (eight patients). Three meals, each labelled with technetium 99m-sulphur colloid, 3.7 MBq were used: (1) a mixed solid meal containing labelled poached egg; (2) 200 ml d-glucose solution, 0.5 kcal/ml, and (3) 200 ml physiological saline. Only gastric emptying rates of the solid meal and glucose solution were significantly delayed. Gastric emptying of saline was normal. The gastric disturbance was confined to patients with anorexia nervosa selecting their own diet. Patients receiving adequate nutrition on the ward had normal gastric emptying and weight gain in this group had no significant effect on emptying. Slow emptying was observed in patients who maintained a low weight solely by food restriction as well as in patients whose anorexia nervosa was complicated by episodes of bulimia. Thus, slow gastric emptying occurred when the quantity of food reaching the duodenum was sufficiently reduced to result in severe weight loss. Moreover, abnormal gastric emptying was seen only after the two meals that contained calories and were hypertonic to plasma, either of which properties could mediate the disturbance. Gastric emptying in bulimia nervosa was normal. Slow gastric emptying could exacerbate undereating in starving patients with anorexia nervosa by enhancing satiety.\r"

Lesions consisted of mild to heavy infiltration of the lamina propria by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The antrum was most consistently affected, but lesions were also present in the fundus and pylorus. Gastric Campylobacter-like organisms (GCLO) apparently identical to human C pylori were cultured and/or detected immunohistologically in several animals. Electron microscopy showed the spiral bacteria on the epithelial surface and in gastric pits. They did not penetrate the cells but were intimately attached to the apical plasma membrane and caused loss of microvilli. Antibodies to C pylori were detected in serum of the monkeys by ELISA. The immunospecificity of this antibody response was confirmed by Western blotting techniques. A small number of cynomolgus monkeys examined had gastritis, which may also be associated with the presence of C pylori. Baboons did not have gastritis, nor was C pylori cultured from their stomachs. The study indicates that the Rhesus monkey has a naturally occurring gastritis associated with C pylori infection and may therefore be a suitable experimental animal for the human disease.\r"

  ".W": "Dogs with naturally occurring aerobic or anaerobic bacterial overgrowth have been examined before and after antibiotic therapy in order to assess reversibility of damage to the jejunal mucosa. Histological changes in peroral jejunal biopsies were relatively minor before and after treatment, but sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed specific biochemical abnormalities that responded to antibiotic therapy. Aerobic overgrowth was initially associated with a marked loss of the main brush border component of alkaline phosphatase activity; this recovered following treatment, suggesting that aerobic bacteria may cause reversible damage to the hydrophobic region of the brush border membrane. In contrast, anaerobic overgrowth was initially associated with a marked reduction in brush border density, indicative of a considerable fall in the glycoprotein-to-lipid ratio of the membrane. Density increased from 1.17 to 1.21 g/ml after antibiotic therapy, consistent with recovery from this relatively severe damage to the brush border caused by anaerobic bacteria. Reductions in soluble and peroxisomal catalase activities which could compromise mucosal protection against free radicals in dogs with aerobic overgrowth, and a loss of particulate malate dehydrogenase activity indicative of mitochondrial disruption in dogs with anaerobic overgrowth, were also reversed after treatment. These findings indicate that aerobic and anaerobic bacterial overgrowth can result in contrasting but potentially reversible damage to the jejunal mucosa which would not be detected by conventional investigative procedures.\r"

With increasing maturity smooth muscle contractility [gastric antral pressure (5-30 mmHg), average duodenal pressure (2-12 mmHg)], propagation and slow wave frequency (10.5-12.5 cpm) all increased in a significant fashion (p less than 0.01).

  ".U": "88226111\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of various inflammatory inhibitors on the damaging effects of ischaemia in the small intestinal mucosa has been investigated. A rat experimental model was used, in which a ligated loop of the distal ileum was subjected to ischaemia and revascularisation and the ensuing mucosal damage assessed by lysosomal enzyme release and intestinal permeability measurements. The mucosal content of malondialdehyde - a lipid peroxidation product - and its activity of myeloperoxidase - a neutrophil granulocyte marker was also determined. In the absence of inhibitor, ischaemia and revascularisation caused increased mucosal permeability to sodium fluorescein, increased N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release from the mucosa into the lumen, increased malondialdehyde content in the mucosa and increased myeloperoxidase activity in the mucosa. All these effects were inhibited by the phospholipase A2 inhibitors, quinacrine and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), while the lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755C, had no influence and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, potentiated the increases in mucosal permeability and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase release. BN 52021, a specific platelet activating factor antagonist, did not influence the myeloperoxidase activity, but it decreased the formation of malondialdehyde and the increases in mucosal permeability and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release, although not to the same extent as quinacrine and NDGA. These findings indicate that phospholipase A2 inhibition prevents mucosal damage associated with small intestinal ischaemia and suggest that at least part of the ischaemic damage is mediated by products of phospholipase A2 activity that are not arachidonic acid metabolites.\r"

As high faecal bile acid concentrations are associated with colonic cancer and may be altered by resection, we have studied changes in faecal bile acid concentrations during promotion of colonic carcinogenesis by increasing small bowel resection. Twenty rats in each group underwent either jejunal transection or 20%, 50%, or 80% proximal small bowel resection. Tumours were induced with azoxymethane 10 mg/kg by 12 weekly subcutaneous injections, and faecal bile acid concentrations were measured at six and 16 weeks. Colonic tumour number rose from 0.6 per rat in the transection group to 1.6 per rat in the 50% resection group (p less than 0.01) but were not significantly different to transection values at 0.8 per rat in the 80% resection group. Total daily faecal bile acid excretion and bile acid concentrations fell with increasing resection from 14.2 (1.6) mg/rat/day and 5.8 (0.7) mg/g dry faeces respectively in the transection group to 6.5 (0.5) mg/rat/day and 2.9 (0.2) mg/g respectively in the 80% resection group (p less than 0.001). The greatest reduction was seen in the concentration of deoxycholic acid which has been particularly associated with the aetiology of colonic cancer. The promotion of colonic tumours following small bowel resection in carcinogen treated rats is unlikely to be mediated by changes in faecal bile acid concentration or composition.\r"

An enriched lymphocyte fraction (LPL) of the Crohn's disease patients showed a higher spontaneous synthesis of IgA and IgG when compared with controls. In contrast, another fraction enriched for macrophages (LPM) produced spontaneously less IgA, IgG, and IgM in Crohn's, than in control patients. Incubation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) decreased immunoglobulin synthesis by LPMC in Crohn's disease and controls, and this was enhanced by simultaneous incubation with concanavalin A. In controls PWM stimulation increased immunoglobulin synthesis by LPL and decreased immunoglobulin synthesis by LPM. In Crohn's disease, however, PWM had no effect on either fraction. This study shows major differences in the regulation of the immunoglobulin synthesis by intestinal cells between Crohn's disease and controls.\r"

In contrast, cells from mucosa affected by ulcerative colitis [11.9 (4.3%) n = 23] or Crohn's disease [8.4 (2.7%) n = 18] released significantly more 51Cr than the non-inflamed groups. Values are expressed as mean (SD). Overall, release values were greater in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease (p less than 0.01). In Crohn's disease, cells obtained from histologically inflamed mucosa released significantly more 51Cr [9.7 (2.5%) n = 11] than those from non-inflamed mucosa [6.4 (1.5%) n = 7, p less than 0.02] whereas, in ulcerative colitis, abnormal release values were found in 8 of 13 cell populations isolated from mucosa showing no histological evidence of active disease. In five patients with distal ulcerative colitis, cells from mucosa not apparently involved demonstrated normal 51Cr release in four of five studies despite abnormal release from cells from involved mucosa suggesting that a diffuse abnormality of the colonic epithelial cell is not usually present. These data indicate that chronic mucosal inflammation per se is associated with abnormalities of the colonic epithelial cell but that, in ulcerative colitis, the abnormality remains in many patients with quiescent disease. Identification of the local factors responsible for such an abnormality may contribute to an understanding of the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.\r"

Normal function of the small intestine was found for the following: (a) absorption tests; (b) water and electrolyte absorption in the proximal jejunum; (c) 24 hour flow rate and composition of fluid entering the colon and (d) gastric emptying rate and small intestinal progression of a normal meal. By contrast, colonic function was markedly impaired in three ways: (a) water absorption was decreased by half; (b) as the main excreted solutes were organic acids, a large electrolyte gap was recorded in faecal water, and (c) colonic transit time of the meal marker was very short, and was in agreement with the rapid transit of ingested radioopaque markers. These data strongly suggest that decreased absorption in the colon secondary to a motor disturbance is the main mechanism of diarrhoea in this case of medullary thyroid carcinoma, while calcitonin induced small intestinal fluid secretion suggested earlier is either non-existent, or only of minor importance.\r"

  ".W": "To study the expression of MHC Class II subregion gene products on biliary epithelial cells in primary biliary cirrhosis, frozen sections from liver biopsies of 15 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were studied immunohistochemically using HLA-D subregion specific monoclonal antibodies L243 (HLA-DR), Leu10 (HLA-DQ) and B7/21 (HLA-DP). Patients with early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis showed expression of HLA-DP, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ subregion gene products on bile duct epithelial cells. In advanced stages of disease, no MHC Class II antigens or only HLA-DR and HLA-DP were expressed on bile duct cells. While normal hepatocytes did not express detectable amounts of MHC Class II antigens, hepatocytes from liver biopsies of four patients with primary biliary cirrhosis showed a distinct staining exclusively with monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-DR. The expression of MHC Class II antigens on parenchymal cells was independent of a lymphocytic infiltration into the tissue. This study demonstrates that bile ductular cells, but not hepatocytes, express a full set of MHC Class II molecules at least during the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis. We propose, therefore, that the expression of both HLA-DR and HLA-DQ subregion products on bile duct epithelial cells may be a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for the initiation of an autoimmune process leading to the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

During an average follow-up period of 35.3 months, cirrhosis occurred 6 to 64 months after entry in 35 HBeAg-positive and 7 anti-HBe positive patients with a calculated annual incidence of 2.4 and 1.3%, respectively (p greater than 0.05). The incidence increased significantly with the increasing age at entry. Patients who had experienced (a) hepatic decompensation, (b) repeated episodes of severe acute exacerbation (with alpha-fetoprotein greater than 100 ng per ml and/or bridging hepatic necrosis), (c) severe acute exacerbation not accompanied by subsequent HBeAg seroconversion and (d) hepatitis B virus reactivation (particularly those with HBeAg reappearance) were found to develop cirrhosis much more frequently (p less than 0.001). Contrary to general belief, patients who had hepatitis delta virus superinfection and patients with chronic active hepatitis were not particularly prone to develop cirrhosis. We conclude that in addition to age factor, the extent, severity, duration, frequency and etiology of the hepatic lobular alterations are important factors for the development of cirrhosis in patients with chronic type B hepatitis.\r"

The presence of this antibody has aroused concerns that treatment with hepatitis B immune globulin might passively induce human immunodeficiency virus antibody seropositivity, leading to incorrect diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus exposure. We studied a group of 16 normal volunteers who received an intramuscular dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (0.06 ml per kg) which was later discovered to contain human immunodeficiency virus antibody. None of the subjects had human immunodeficiency virus antibody before receiving hepatitis B immune globulin. Serum specimens collected at 1 to 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after the injection were consistently negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibody. There was no detectable human immunodeficiency virus antibody in any specimen from any subject. We conclude that intramuscular therapy with hepatitis B immune globulin in the recommended dose does not appear to place patients at risk of passive seroconversion to human immunodeficiency virus antibody positivity, despite the presence of antibody in the injected material.\r"

Infection with duck hepatitis B virus occurred in all inoculated ducks, although this was not associated with clinical morbidity. Duck hepatitis B virus DNA was first detected in liver on Day 3, in pancreatic acinar cells on Day 4, serum on Day 6, splenic red and white pulp on Day 7 and in the renal glomurulus on Day 14, using a combination of dot, Southern blot and in situ hybridization techniques. Peak levels of circulating virus, as determined by DNA polymerase levels, occurred 1 to 4 weeks postinoculation. Mild degrees of portal inflammation were seen in sections of liver tissue in both infected and control ducks. However, moderately severe inflammatory changes were present in 8 of 22 infected birds compared with 0 of 18 controls (p less than 0.025). Appearance of this inflammatory infiltrate 6 weeks postinoculation coincided with a decrease in levels of duck hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatocytes and within the pancreatic acinar cells. At the same time, duck hepatitis B virus DNA became increasingly localized to the splenic germinal centers, and viral DNA was first detected in pancreatic islet cells. No histological changes accompanied the extra-hepatic tissue infection. The sequence and significance of duck hepatitis B virus infection in liver and extra-hepatic tissues is discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus infection in man.\r"

  ".W": "De novo formation of laminin-positive basement membranes was found to be a distinct morphologic feature of diethylnitrosamine/phenobarbital-induced hepatocellular carcinomas of the rat. The first appearance of extracellularly located laminin occurred in the preneoplastic liver lesions (corresponding to neoplastic nodules), and this feature became successively more prominent during the course of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Most groups of tumor cells were surrounded by laminin-positive basement membrane material. The laminin-positive material was also deposited along the sinusoids, a location where no laminin was seen in normal rat liver. The amount of extractable laminin from hepatocellular carcinomas was significantly higher (approximately 100 ng per mg tissue) than that of normal liver tissue (less than 20 ng per mg). In vitro experiments demonstrated that normal and preneoplastic rat hepatocytes had the capacity to lay down basement membrane-like material. This occurred, however, only when the hepatocytes were cocultured with certain feeder cells or when grown in the presence of their conditioned media. These results indicate that during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat some as yet undefined humoral factor(s) might influence the hepatocytes to turn on genes encoding the basement membrane components and further stimulate the assembly and deposition of basement membranes.\r"

Several recent studies have shown the existence of the same receptor in murine liver. However, the biochemical structure of the receptor in murine liver has not been resolved. In this paper, we describe the identification and purification of the receptor for asialoglycoproteins from murine liver. The purified receptor has three polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 42,000, 45,000 and 51,000, respectively, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the receptor from murine liver is very similar to its counterpart in rat liver, although some potential interesting differences have also been observed. Initial studies indicate that this receptor is well conserved in different mouse strains.\r"

To assess the respective roles of liver disease and alcohol consumption as well as the specificity of this immune response, 141 patients in various stages of alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver diseases were tested by a hemagglutination assay. Sixty-three (73%) of 86 alcoholics had antibody titers above control levels (p less than 0.0001). Alcohol consumption of these individuals was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than that of those alcoholics with normal titers. Twenty-two patients (39%) with nonalcoholic liver diseases also had elevated levels of antibodies against acetaldehyde adducts (p less than 0.0005); of these, 8 had primary biliary cirrhosis (7 in Stages III and IV), 9 had chronic active hepatitis (6 with cirrhosis) and 5 had acute (virus- or drug-induced) hepatitis. Antibody titers did not correlate with levels of transaminase or alkaline phosphatase activity, nor with bilirubin, and albumin. However, in 52 alcoholics and in nonalcoholic patients with biopsy-confirmed liver disease, the highest titers were seen in the more advanced stages of liver damage. Thus, in addition to alcohol consumption, severity of liver disease may play a role in the appearance of circulating antibodies against acetaldehyde adducts.\r"

In a control group without liver disease (8 smokers, 15 nonsmokers), we found a caffeine clearance of 114 +/- 40 ml per min in smokers and 64 +/- 20 in nonsmokers (p less than 0.05). Smoking and nonsmoking patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis did not differ with respect to clinical and laboratory data and hexobarbitone elimination. However, caffeine clearance was 63 +/- 63 ml per min in smoking patients compared to 34 +/- 49 ml per min in nonsmokers (p less than 0.05). Fasting plasma concentrations of caffeine were higher in nonsmokers (5.1 +/- 6.2 micrograms per ml) than in smokers (2.1 +/- 4.5 micrograms per ml, p less than 0.05). We conclude that smoking habits have to be taken into account if caffeine is used as a model compound for measuring quantitative liver function.\r"

Since the generation of reactive oxygen species results in an increased formation of glutathione disulfide, we have attempted to document an oxidant stress during reperfusion of ischemic liver by following the hepatic production of glutathione disulfide in vivo and in the perfused rat liver. Following partial hepatic ischemia of 120 min duration, the plasma concentration of glutathione disulfide gradually increased from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 9.1 +/- 1.6 microM (mean +/- S.E., n = 6) after 1 hr of reperfusion. The plasma concentration of reduced glutathione increased only 2-fold from 21.4 +/- 2.4 to 38.1 +/- 3.4 microM. The rise in plasma glutathione disulfide was higher with increasing duration of ischemia from 30 to 120 min and was associated with a gradual increase in hepatic glutathione disulfide. The hepatic origin of glutathione disulfide was documented in the perfused rat liver where the release of glutathione disulfide increased gradually during reperfusion following 90 min of warm ischemia from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 nmole per min per gm liver at 30 min after onset of reperfusion. The administration of allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, did not decrease the release of glutathione disulfide (29.9 +/- 3.8 nmoles per gm in controls vs. 44.7 +/- 10.0 nmoles per gm in 30 min with allopurinol) and ALT (3.3 +/- 1.4 units per gm in controls vs. 2.6 +/- 0.8 units per gm in 30 min with allopurinol).

  ".W": "Trypan blue uptake and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured as indices of irreversible cell damage in isolated, perfused rat livers during low-flow hypoxia. In livers from fasted rats perfused in the anterograde direction, trypan blue uptake took place beginning at about 45 min of hypoxia. Cells which took up trypan blue first were located in narrow bands at the border between anoxic pericentral areas and normoxic periportal regions of the liver lobule. After longer periods of hypoxia, trypan blue uptake progressed towards the central vein until after 120 min virtually all cells in the pericentral regions were stained. Under these conditions, cells in periportal regions were spared. In perfusions in the retrograde direction, cell death began in midzonal regions and spread towards the portal vein. Release of lactate dehydrogenase into the effluent paralleled trypan blue uptake, beginning at about 40 min of low-flow hypoxia and peaking at 80 min. In contrast to livers from fasted rats, trypan blue was not taken up, and lactate dehydrogenase was not released in livers from fed rats exposed to low-flow hypoxia for as long as 120 min. To test the hypothesis that xanthine oxidase-mediated oxygen-free radical formation was involved in cell injury at the border between anoxic and normoxic regions (anoxic edge), allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, was studied. Allopurinol (0.2 to 5 mM) delayed the release of lactate dehydrogenase during low-flow hypoxia in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 5 mM allopurinol delayed hypoxia-induced lactate dehydrogenase release by about 30 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similar time courses were observed for the serum and liver tissue concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone and the--albeit minimal--extent of hepatocellular necrosis. Phospholipids in the liver homogenate were unchanged after 1 week, but significantly increased after prolonged amiodarone treatment. There was no significant alteration in the pattern of individual phospholipids. Serum and tissue concentrations as well as the extent of phospholipidosis do not appear to be a function of the duration of drug application. A very close correlation, however, was observed between the liver tissue concentration of amiodarone and the amount of dense bodies as a morphological expression of phospholipidosis.\r"

Hepatocytes derived from livers of chronically griseofulvin-pretreated mice differed in their response from normal hepatocytes in that ethanol was ineffective in these cells. These results indicate that different modes and pathways of the stress response exist, depending on the nature of the inducing agent but also on pretreatment conditions.

  ".W": "The mechanism of ethinylestradiol-induced biliary secretion of excess cholesterol, a potential causative factor of cholesterol gallstones, is not yet known. It might be related to altered bile acid metabolism, since the rate of cholesterol and phospholipid secreted into bile is thought to be influenced by the hydrophobicity of the bile acid species secreted. We therefore studied the effect of ethinylestradiol on bile acid metabolism and on secretory relationships between taurocholate and cholesterol/phospholipids in bile. Litter-matched Syrian female hamsters (80 to 100 gm body weight) were injected subcutaneously with either 0.2 ml per day corn oil (controls) or a pharmacologic dose of 5 mg per kg per day ethinylestradiol in corn oil (EE-hamsters; n = 6) for 5 days. On Day 6, bile was collected for 60 min (basal secretory rate) via a bile duct fistula after exclusion of the gallbladder. Then, a graded infusion of taurocholate was given for 110 to 130 min. Secretory rates (nmoles.min-1.-1 liver) for bile acids, cholesterol and phospholipids were determined and their mutual \"linkage coefficients\" (nmoles of secretory increment per 1 nmole of bile acid secreted) calculated by linear regression analysis. EE-hamsters had higher (p less than 0.02) basal secretory rates of cholesterol (0.71 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.10) and phospholipids (5.74 +/- 1.04 vs. 4.21 +/- 0.73) than controls at comparable bile flow and bile salt secretion rates. Cholic acid pool size and the fractional composition of bile acid species in bile were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sn-protoporphyrin, a potent competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme to bile pigment, was administered to 10 normal volunteers: 8 males and 2 females. A significant decrease in the levels of serum (mean decrease; 38%) and biliary bilirubin (mean decrease: 47%) was demonstrated in all 10 subjects. The decrease in these parameters lasted for a minimum of 4 days after administration of the metalloporphyrin. Sn-protoporphyrin also facilitated the excretion of endogenous heme in bile during the 24- to 48-hr period following administration of the compound. The metalloporphyrin was rapidly cleared from plasma with a half-life of 3.4 hr. A small amount (3 to 6%) of Sn-protoporphyrin was excreted in both urine and bile. The activity of microsomal heme oxygenase was measured in five human liver samples freshly obtained at the time of cholecystectomy and varied from approximately 2 to 4 nmoles bilirubin formed per mg protein per hour. The addition of Sn-protoporphyrin to microsomal heme oxygenase isolated from these liver samples resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of this enzyme at concentrations of the metalloporphyrin in the range of 10(-7) to 10(-9) M. The findings reported here provide strong evidence that the suppression of biliary and serum bilirubin levels and the enhancement of heme excretion in the bile of the normal volunteers examined in this study were due to inhibition of physiological rates of heme oxidation activity by the synthetic heme analog, Sn-protoporphyrin.\r"

Paracentesis was repeated if evidence of peritonitis developed during the hospitalization. The ascitic fluid opsonic activity (0.2 +/- 0.5 log kill) of 24 spontaneously infected specimens was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than that of the group with sterile portal hypertension-related ascites (0.8 +/- 1.1 log kill), and significantly lower than the group with ascites of miscellaneous type (2.4 +/- 1.0 log kill, p less than 0.001). The C3 and C4 concentrations of the spontaneous peritonitis specimens were also significantly lower than in the specimens from the other groups. Of the 55 patients whose initial sterile ascitic fluid opsonic activity was less than 0.2 log kill, 8 (14.5%) developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during the hospitalization; whereas none of the 70 patients with sterile ascitic fluid opsonic activity greater than or equal to 0.2 log kill developed spontaneous peritonitis. This difference in the risk of development of peritonitis was significant (p less than 0.01). Patients with deficient ascitic fluid opsonic activity are predisposed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\r"

  ".W": "In animals, there may exist a hyperemic response in the portal circulation during intravenous administration of hypertonic glucose, but a hemodynamic response of this kind has never been described in man. This study was designed to evaluate if hyperglycemia itself could induce systemic or splanchnic hemodynamic changes in patients with cirrhosis. Sixteen patients with cirrhosis were studied before and during i.v. infusions of hypertonic (900 mOsmoles per liter) glucose (n = 8), mannitol (n = 4) or saline (n = 4) at 2 ml per min. In the group receiving glucose, there were significant increases in hepatic venous pressure gradient (+12%), azygos blood flow (+27%) and pulmonary capillary pressure (+32%), while calf blood flow decreased (-26%). No changes occurred in the mannitol or saline groups. Changes in plasma osmolality, plasma volume, splanchnic oxygen extraction and vasoactive hormones, including vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and glucagon, did not appear to be involved in the mechanism of these vasoactive phenomena. It is suggested that the possible deleterious effects of increase in portal pressure and azygos blood flow should be taken into consideration when administering hypertonic glucose to patients with portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular alterations such as increased heart rate, high cardiac output, reduced systemic vascular resistance, and in most of the cases, increased contractility parameters have been recognized in patients with advanced liver disease. Some investigators define a cirrhotic cardiomyopathy as a hyperdynamic failure of the heart. Consequently, in patients with cirrhosis, the risk of developing further circulatory deterioration may be increased in situations which stress the cardiovascular system. After opening a portocaval shunt, it is expected that a large amount of blood will be distributed from the splanchnic to the pulmonary circulation and put a strain on the heart. This two-dimensional echocardiographic study was made in 30 patients with cirrhosis and in 20 patients who were chronically treated (range: 16 to 156 months) with portasystemic shunt for prevention of hemorrhage from esophageal variceal bleeding. Patients with portasystemic shunts revealed a change in hemodynamic pattern. There was a significant increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and also a slight increase in the left ventricular end-systolic index. Cardiac output remained high despite a significant decrease in heart rate due to an elevated left ventricular stroke volume index. The parameters of systolic ventricular performance were normal. In contrast to the acute opening of the portacaval shunt, the chronic shunt volume put no strain of clinical significance on the heart.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodynamic and ventricular energetic parameters were measured in calves implanted with the air driven Utah Ventricular Assist Device (UVAD). Uptake site was varied to determine the effect of control mode and vacuum augmentation of filing. Uptake was drawn solely from the left atrium or combined with a left ventricular apical vent. LVAD outflow returned to the descending, thoracic aorta. Control modes examined included asynchronous pumping as well as 1:1 and 1:2 synchronous diastolic counterpulsation. The 85cc LVAD, vacuum formed from PELLETHANE, was implanted acutely in four animals and chronically in six (7, 49 and 116 days paracorporeally, 1, 28 and 32 days intrathoracically). Instantaneous blood pressures, intramyocardial pressure, aortic outflow, oxygen consumption, LVAD output and drive parameters were recorded. LVAD output was independent of control mode when the natural heart rate was greater than or equal to 80 beats per minute. Intrathoracically positioned LVADs pumped a mean flow of approximately equal to 5 liters/min without vacuum augmentation of filling. Paracorporeally positioned LVADs pumped approximately equal to 3 liters/min mean flow without vacuum augmentation and up to approximately equal to 6 liters/min with 38 mm Hg of vacuum augmentation of filling. Instantaneous ascending aortic pressure and flow showed distinct beat-to-beat variation depending on LVAD control mode. Lower average ventricular afterload was observed when pumping the LVAD asynchronously or 1:2 synchronously. In one acute preparation, left ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption was reduced from the unassisted average control level by 37% for the asynchronous and 1:1 synchronous control modes with left atrial uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this paper we describe a new technique that couples secondary filtration for the removal of macromolecules, with ultrafiltration of ascitic fluid. In its very first application 6 patients underwent 8 treatments. No adverse effect was observed and clinical efficacy was good. Up to 60 g of albumin can be saved in a single session lasting less than 2 hours.\r"

Dialysis decreased plasma triglycerides to the same extent as when heparin was given without dialysis. Cholesterol increased in proportion to hemoconcentration. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels were also increased, but more so than with heparin alone. Glucose and acetate did not play a role, nor did carnitine loss, and hemofiltration elicited similar effects. The rise in plasma FFA is therefore likely to be caused by other as yet unknown mechanism.\r"

The amplitude of the isometric twitch of FDL was unaffected but in soleus it remained depressed for much of the recovery period. Immediately after stimulation the twitch time to peak of FDL increased to 140% of the control (prefatigue) value and then reverted to control values. The maximum isometric tetanic tension (Po) developed by FDL was reduced to 67% of control values immediately after the stimulus regime, whereas soleus declined to 93% of control. Recovery of maximum force development was achieved after 45 min in FDL and after 15 min in soleus. The maximum speed of shortening of FDL was reduced to 63% of control values immediately after fatigue; despite some recovery within the first 30 min, it remained depressed during the remainder of the recovery period (up to 300 min). Maximum speed of shortening was unaltered in soleus. The a/Po value transiently increased to 176% of control values in FDL immediately after the fatigue regime but promptly returned to control values. Force-velocity properties of soleus were not affected by the stimulus regime. It is concluded that in FDL changes in the maximum speed of shortening and maximum isometric tension as a result of the stimulus regime are attributable to changes in the intrinsic behavior of cross-bridges and the metabolic status of the fibers, particularly in the fast-twitch fatigue-resistant fibers.\r"

To ascertain whether this response is related to the temporal pattern of pressure perturbation (reaching a peak in early or midinspiration and declining subsequently) we compared the response of nine normal subjects to a usual resistor (narrow tube, RES) with their response when mouth pressure was reduced in a sinusoidal fashion during inspiration (SIN). Whereas the negative pressure pattern was similar with both loads (peak negative pressure near midinspiration), there was no relation between pressure and flow in the case of sinusoidal loading. Each experiment consisted of two loading periods, 4 min each, and three unloaded periods, also 4 min each, bracketing the periods of loading. The order of RES and SIN was randomized. TI during loading was compared with the average TI of the preceding and following unloaded periods. TI increased 0.74 +/- 0.12 and 0.27 +/- 0.05 (SE) s during RES and SIN, respectively (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the temporal pattern of pressure change during resistance breathing plays a small role in mediating the TI prolongation. Coupling between flow and the pressure perturbation appears to be an important determinant of TI prolongation.\r"

Normal young adults were exposed to two consecutive 25-min periods of sustained isocapnic hypoxia (80% O2 saturation in arterial blood), separated by varying interludes of room air breathing or an increased inspired O2 fraction (FIO2). The decline in the hypoxic ventilatory response during the 1st 25 min of hypoxia was not restored after a 7-min interlude of room air breathing; inspired ventilation (VI) at the end of the first hypoxic period was not different from VI at the beginning and end of the second hypoxic period. After a 15-min interlude of room air breathing, the hypoxic ventilatory response had begun to recover. With a 60-min interlude of room air breathing, recovery was complete; VI during the second hypoxic exposure matched VI during the first hypoxic period. Ventilatory recovery was accelerated by breathing supplemental O2. With a 15-min interlude of 0.3 FIO2 or 7 min of 1.0 FIO2, VI of the first and second hypoxic periods were equivalent. Both the decline and recovery of the hypoxic ventilatory response were related to alterations in tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI), with little alteration in respiratory timing. We conclude that the mechanism of the decline in the ventilatory response with sustained hypoxia may require up to 1 h for complete reversal and that the restoration is O2 sensitive.\r"

Each subject was tested four times by two testers on two different days. Generalizability theory was used to estimate reliability and measurement error that considered both day-to-day and intertester error. The BIA, skinfold fat, and hydrostatic methods were all found to be reliable (Rxx = 0.957-0.987) with standard errors ranging from 0.9 to 1.5% fat. An additional 26 men (n = 50) and 38 women (n = 82) were tested once and combined with the data used for the reliability analysis to cross-validate BIA estimates of % fat with hydrostatically determined % fat. The cross-validation correlations for the BIA determinations of % fat ranged from 0.71 to 0.76, which were significantly lower than that obtained with the sum of seven (sigma 7) skinfolds equations (rxy = 0.92 for men and 0.88 for women). The correlations between the weight-to-height ratio body mass index (BMI) and hydrostatically determined % fat were 0.75 and 0.74 for men and women, respectively. The standard errors of estimate for the two BIA models ranged from 4.6 to 6.4% fat compared with 2.6 and 3.6% fat for the sigma 7 equations. The BIA method for measuring body composition was comparable to the BMI method, with height and weight accounting for most of the variance in the BIA equation.\r"

To examine the relationship between Pcrit and the development of upper airway occlusion, we examined the relationship between maximal inspiratory airflow and nasal pressure in seven normal subjects during sleep. At varying levels of subatmospheric pressure applied to a nasal mask during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, maximal inspiratory airflow decreased in proportion to the level of nasal pressure. When nasal pressure fell below a Pcrit, subjects demonstrated upper airway occlusions terminated by arousals. In these normal subjects, the upper airway Pcrit was found to be -13.3 +/- 3.2 (SD) cmH2O. In four subjects who sustained sleep while nasal pressure remained below the Pcrit, recurrent occlusive apneas were demonstrated. The relationship between maximal inspiratory airflow and nasal pressure in each subject was fit by linear regression and demonstrated upper airway Pcrit at the zero-flow intercept that were not significantly different from those observed experimentally. These data demonstrate that the normal human upper airway during sleep is characterized by a negative Pcrit and that occlusion may be induced when nasal pressure is decreased below this Pcrit.\r"

A total of 233 tests were performed during wakefulness (W), 98 tests in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and 72 tests in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Prolongation of inspiratory time (TI) of the first occluded effort occurred in all tests irrespective of behavioral state, with the greatest increase seen in awake N tests. Nasal tests augmented EMGgg activity in the first occluded breath and produced a linear increase in EMGgg during occlusion. The EMGgg activity at any given time during nasal occlusion in SWS was less than that recorded during W tests. There was a marked reduction in EMGgg response to N occlusion during REM sleep. The EMGgg activity during awake T tests was significantly less than that of N tests at any given time during occlusion. There was no relationship between the level of EMGgg activity and asphyxia in T tests performed during SWS and REM sleep. Nasal tests decreased the force generated by the inspiratory pump muscles and the central drive to breathing compared with T tests. These results confirm the important role of the UAW in regulating breathing pattern and indicate that both immediate and progressive load-compensating responses during nasal occlusion are influenced by information arising from the UAW.\r"

Calculated 72-h protein utilization (means +/- SE) was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) for the 5 (86.9 +/- 27.1 g) and 20 (82.9 +/- 22.7 g) compared with 30 degrees C (34.01 +/- 19.1 g) trial. Regardless of ambient temperature exercise increased the venous concentration of C, E, and NE. These catabolic hormones were greatest in 5, lowest in 20, and intermediate in 30 degrees C. Exercise Tre and VO2 were greatest in the 30 degrees C environment. Venous FFA concentration was significantly higher and R significantly lower in 5 vs. 20 or 30 degrees C, and venous LA concentration was significantly greater in 30 vs. 20 or 5 degrees C. Although these results indicate that exercise protein breakdown is affected by ambient temperatures, the mechanism of action is not due solely to circulating NE, E, and C. Differences in venous FFA and LA across environmental temperatures suggest that alterations in carbohydrate and fat metabolism may have contributed to the observed variable protein utilization.\r"

Each patient with sleep apnea had a polysomnograph sleep study with oxyhemoglobin saturation continuously recorded. Five of 12 patients with sleep apnea had both sleep apnea and severe hypoxemia during sleep. These patients with severe nocturnal hypoxemia had significantly higher plasma adenosine levels (means +/- SD 9.7 +/- 5.5 X 10(-8) M) than either a group of six normal volunteers (3.5 +/- 0.7 X 10(-8) M) or a group of seven patients with sleep apnea without hypoxemia at night (3.1 +/- 1.5 X 10(-8) M) (P less than 0.01).

The albumin movements were evaluated through a large field gamma camera placed laterally to the animal and detecting total (AT) and regional activities from two superimposed equal areas (At and Ab, top and bottom, respectively). The At/Ab ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.3 in four animals up to 20 min from the change in posture and from 0.9 to 0.5 in four more animals studied from 50 to 90 min from turning maneuver. The rate of change in At and Ab was similar in the two groups of animals and unaffected by the acquisition posture. AT decreased by 7.7 and 3.5% for the two groups, respectively, reflecting albumin clearance from the pleural space. The opposite time course of regional activities and the independence of their rate of change of the At/Ab ratio and of the animal posture suggest a top-to-bottom albumin transfer occurring through a bulk flow of liquid estimated at 0.006 ml.kg-1.h-1. The data are consistent with a measured vertical pleural liquid pressure gradient that does not reflect a hydrostatic condition.\r"

During PE infusion, measures of blood pressures, forearm blood flow, heart rate and cardiac output, and calculations of forearm vascular resistance, stroke volume, and peripheral vascular resistance were made at each infusion rate when steady-state blood pressure was attained. No significant differences (P less than 0.05) in forearm blood flow or resistance were observed between the groups at any dose of PE, suggesting that the vasoconstrictor response was similar among the groups. Regression analyses of heart rate against mean blood pressure during the PE infusion were performed to evaluate baroreflex function. A linear model was used and correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 0.96 were obtained (P less than 0.05). The slope of the line of best fit for the ET subjects (-0.57) was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than the slopes obtained for either the UT (-0.91) or WT (-0.88) subjects.

  ".W": "Thoracoabdominal restriction was brought on by means of a corset, and the subsequent effects on thoracic dimensions and lung tissue were studied by computerized tomography (CT) and by various lung function tests in supine healthy volunteers (mean age 30 yr). Restriction caused reductions in total lung capacity (helium equilibration) from mean 6.84 to 4.80 liters, in functional residual capacity (FRC) from 2.65 to 2.08 liters, and in vital capacity from 5.16 to 3.45 liters. Closing capacity (single-breath N2 washout) fell from 2.42 to 1.88 liters, thus matching the reduction in FRC. The static pressure-lung volume curve was shifted to the right by 1.5 cmH2O at 50% of total lung capacity. However, no change in the slope of the curve was observed. The diaphragm was moved cranially by 1.2 cm, and the thoracic cross-sectional area was reduced by a mean 32 cm2 at a level just above the diaphragm. No changes in the lung tissue were seen on CT scanning. Gas exchange, as assessed by multiple inert gas elimination technique and arterial blood gas analysis, was unaffected by restriction. It is concluded that in supine subjects, thoracoabdominal restriction that reduces FRC by 0.6 liter is not accompanied by atelectasis (normal CT scan). In this respect the result differs from that found in anesthetized supine subjects who show the same fall in FRC and atelectasis in dependent lung regions.\r"

Increased responsiveness in large airways after O3 breathing has been associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. To determine whether O3 produces prolonged hyperresponsiveness of small airways associated with the presence of inflammatory cells, we exposed the peripheral lungs of anesthetized dogs to 1.0 ppm O3 for 2 h using a wedged bronchoscope technique. A contralateral sublobar segment was simultaneously exposed to air as a control. In the O3-exposed segments, collateral resistance (Rcs) was increased within 15 min and remained elevated approximately 150% throughout the 2-h exposure period. Fifteen hours later, the base-line Rcs of the O3-exposed sublobar segments was significantly elevated, and these segments demonstrated increased responsiveness to aerosolized acetylcholine (100 and 500 micrograms/ml). There were no differences in neutrophils, mononuclear cells, or mast cells (numbers or degree of mast cell degranulation) between O3 and air-exposed airways at 15 h. The small airways of the lung periphery thus are capable of remaining hyperresponsive hours after cessation of localized exposure to O3, but this does not appear to be dependent on the presence of inflammatory cells in the small airway wall.\r"

Histological materials were obtained after airway fixation by formaldehyde solution and analyzed for vessel diameter in the branching order of 1, 2, and 3, with the smallest noncapillary vessel designated as order 1, in accord with the Strahler system. The change in vessel diameter within a branching order at different levels of transmural pressure is a derived measure of vascular elasticity expressed as compliance coefficient alpha, alpha Values are 0.128, 0.164, and 0.210 micron/cmH2O or 0.682, 0.472, and 0.354%/cmH2O, respectively, of orders 1-3 for arterioles and 0.187, 0.215, and 0.250 micron/cmH2O or 0.992, 0.612, and 0.424%/cmH2O, respectively, of orders 1-3 for venules.

During quiet breathing in the intact animal the rib cage behaved as a unit (Aurc: 14.6 +/- 7.9 vs. Alrc: 15.1 +/- 9.6%), whereas considerable distortions of the rib cage occurred during breathing after bilateral phrenicotomy (Aurc: 21.0 +/- 5.1 vs. Alrc: 7.0 +/- 4.8%). These distortions were even more pronounced during phrenic nerve stimulation and separate stimulation of the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm (e.g., phrenic nerve stimulation; Aurc: -7.1 +/- 5.1 vs. Alrc: 6.9 +/- 3.5%). During the latter maneuvers the upper rib cage deflated along the relationship between upper rib cage dimensions and pleural pressure obtained during passive deflation, whereas the lower rib cage inflated close to the relationship between lower rib cage dimensions and abdominal pressure obtained during passive inflation. The latter relationship is expected to differ between costal and crural stimulation, since costal action has both an appositional and insertional component and crural action only has an appositional component. The difference between costal and crural stimulation, however, was relatively small, and the slopes were only slightly steeper for the costal than for the crural stimulation (2.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rabbits were studied under four conditions: at rest and after 20 s of treadmill exercise, both before and approximately 5 min after acute barodenervation of the conscious animal. During exercise in the baroinnervated state, approximately 40% of the increased blood flow to skeletal and cardiac muscle was contributed by diversion from the splanchnic organs, kidneys, systemic arteriovenous anastomoses, and skin. This diversion of blood flow during exercise was absent after arterial barodenervation. We conclude that at the onset of exercise in rabbits the mismatch between cardiac output and the metabolic demands of skeletal and cardiac muscle is accommodated by vasoconstriction in other vascular beds. We suggest that the vasoconstriction in the splanchnic organs and skin may be caused by transient suppression of the reflex effects of arterial baroreceptor input at the onset of exercise.\r"

Transpulmonary pressure was measured simultaneously, allowing identification of the lung volume above residual volume at which there was an inflection point in the pressure-volume curve (VIP). Although phase IV for Ar was upward, phase IV for N2 was small and variable, especially in the prone position. No significant prone to supine differences in closing capacity for Ar were seen, indicating that airway closure was generated at the same lung volumes. The maximum deflections of phase IV for Ar and N2 from extrapolated phase III slopes were smaller in the prone position, suggesting more uniform tracer gas concentrations across the lungs. VIP was smaller than the closing volume for Ar, which is consistent with the effects of well-developed collateral ventilation in dogs. Body rotation tests in three dogs did not generally cause an inversion of phase III or IV. We conclude that in recumbent dogs regional distribution of ventilation is not primarily determined by the effect of gravity, but by lung, thorax, and mediastinum interactions and/or differences in regional mechanical properties of the lungs.\r"

Subjects exercised for three successive 25-min periods wearing a water-perfused suit: control [CT, mean skin temperature (Tsk) = 35 degrees C], hot (H, Tsk = 38 degrees C), and cold (C, Tsk = 31 degrees C). During the heating period, esophageal temperature increased to a maximum of 37.91, 39.35, and 39.05 degrees C in the three types of exercise, respectively. There were no significant changes in pulmonary O2 uptake (VO2) throughout the entire exercise period with either one or two legs. Leg blood flow (LBF), measured in the femoral vein of one leg by thermodilution, remained unchanged between CT, H, and C periods. Venous plasma lactate concentration gradually declined over time, and no trend for an increased lactate release during the heating period was found. Similarly, femoral arteriovenous O2 difference and leg VO2 remained unchanged between the three exercise periods. Although cardiac output (acetylene rebreathing) was not significantly higher during H, there was a tendency for an increase of 1 and 2 l/min in one- and two-legged exercise, respectively, which could account for part of the increase in total skin blood flow during heating (gauged by changes in forearm blood flow). Because LBF was not reduced during exercise and heat stress in these experiments, the additional increase in skin blood flow must have been met by redistribution of blood away from vascular beds other than active skeletal muscle.\r"

In the present study we measured respiratory changes in transverse abdominis length using sonomicrometry in 14 pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized supine dogs and compared length changes to simultaneously recorded tidal volume and transverse abdominis electromyograms (EMG). To determine muscle resting length at passive functional residual capacity (LFRC), the animals were hyperventilated to apnea. The transverse abdominis was electrically active in all animals during resting O2 breathing (eupnea). During inspiration the transverse abdominis lengthened above resting length in all 14 dogs by a mean of 3.7 +/- 1.1% LFRC; during expiration the transverse abdominis shortened below resting length in 13 of 14 dogs by a mean of 4.2 +/- 0.9% LFRC. Increasing hyperoxic hypercapnia (produced in 9 animals) progressively heightened transverse abdominis EMG and progressively increased the extent of muscle shortening below resting length (to 12.6 +/- 3.2% LFRC at a PCO2 of 90 Torr). During single-breath airway occlusion substantial inspiratory lengthening of the transverse abdominis occurred, both during O2 breathing and during CO2 rebreathing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effects of carotid body excision (CBX) on eupneic ventilation and the ventilatory responses to acute hypoxia, hyperoxia, and chronic hypoxia in unanesthetized rats. Arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and calculated minute alveolar ventilation to minute metabolic CO2 production (VA/VCO2) ratio were used to determine the ventilatory responses. The effects of CBX and sham operation were compared with intact controls (PaCO2 = 40.0 +/- 0.1 Torr, mean +/- 95% confidence limits, and VA/VCO2 = 21.6 +/- 0.1). CBX rats showed 1) chronic hypoventilation with respiratory acidosis, which was maintained for at least 75 days after surgery (PaCO2 = 48.4 +/- 1.1 Torr and VA/VCO2 = 17.9 +/- 0.4), 2) hyperventilation in response to acute hyperoxia vs. hypoventilation in intact rats, 3) an attenuated increase in VA/VCO2 in acute hypoxemia (arterial PO2 approximately equal to 49 Torr), which was 31% of the 8.7 +/- 0.3 increase in VA/VCO2 observed in control rats, 4) no ventilatory acclimatization between 1 and 24 h hypoxia, whereas intact rats had a further 7.5 +/- 1.5 increase in VA/VCO2, 5) a decreased PaCO2 upon acute restoration of normoxia after 24 h hypoxia in contrast to an increased PaCO2 in controls. We conclude that in rats carotid body chemoreceptors are essential to maintain normal eupneic ventilation and to the process of ventilatory acclimatization to chronic hypoxia.\r"

Our subjects were 10 young males with normal cardiopulmonary function. Before exercise we measured PTT in each subject by administering supramaximal electrical pulses of 100-microseconds duration at a frequency of 1 Hz to each phrenic nerve with the subjects breath holding at functional residual capacity at a given thoracoabdominal configuration. A minimum of six satisfactory PTT measurements were made in each subject, and we computed the 95% confidence limits (CL) for each subject. The subjects then inspired through a resistive load of 38 cmH2O.1(-1).s-1 while carrying out the GXT until exhaustion. After the GXT, PTT was remeasured in all subjects. In five of the subjects, the post-GXT mean PTT fell below the 95% CL of the pre-GXT mean PTT. However, post-GXT PTT means for the other five subjects were within the 95% CL of the pre-GXT means. In conclusion, using PTT as a measure of LFDF, these results demonstrate that LFDF can be produced in 50% of spontaneously breathing young normal males.\r"

Using boli of a second insoluble gas delivered at a given point during inspirations of a multibreath washout test, the proportions of labeled inspired ventilation reaching the poorly and well-ventilated regions may be determined by analyzing the kinetics of the exhaled tracer. We studied eight normal subjects breathing through large-bore solenoid valves controlled to maintain tidal volume at 600 or 900 ml. Boli consisting of 15 ml of 80% He-20% O2 were delivered over 75 ms; this labeled approximately 125 ml of inspired gas. Boli were delivered after 50 ml had been inspired to mark early inspiration and after 300 ml had been inspired to mark midinspiration. Using 900-ml tidal breaths, late inspiration was marked by boli delivered at 600 ml. Subjects were studied in the seated and the supine positions. In both positions, significantly more of the early breath went to the poorly ventilated compartment. Several possible physiological mechanisms, singly or in combination, could account for these observations, but differences in dead space path length are most likely involved.\r"

We used stereologic-morphometric measurements at different magnifications to determine the absolute volume of each subcellular compartment per average capillary endothelial cell. The increases in this value during the first 3 days of postexposure repair were 118% for cytoplasm, 786% for polyribosomes, 310% for rough endoplasmic reticulum, and 79% for mitochondria; the volume of pinocytotic vesicles did not change. By day 7 of repair, only the polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum were still increased; by day 14 all values were normal. We conclude that the capillary endothelial cell hypertrophy that develops during repair of hyperoxic lung injury is associated with large and heterogeneous increases in subcellular organelles and is not merely due to increases in the cytosol or to cellular edema. These increases seem to be an integral part of the repair process and may be important in the development of tolerance to subsequent oxygen exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The temporal relationships among increases in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, myosin dephosphorylation, and relaxation were investigated to clarify the mechanisms of airway muscle relaxation. Canine tracheal muscles isometrically contracted (82% of maximum force) with 10(-6) M methacholine were relaxed by adding either 4 x 10(-7) M atropine or 4 x 10(-5) M forskolin. Atropine had no effect on cAMP levels; myosin phosphorylation and force, however, decayed at the same rates and these two parameters returned to their basal pre-methacholine levels within 5 min. Forskolin treatment results in about a 10-fold increase in cAMP levels; myosin phosphorylation and force decayed simultaneously to their respective steady-state levels by 10 min but neither parameter returned to its pre-methacholine level. The addition of forskolin to muscles maximally contracted with 10(-4) M methacholine leads to about a 30-fold increase in cAMP levels. However, there are minimal decreases in myosin phosphorylation and force in these muscles. Thus myosin dephosphorylation appears to be essential for airway muscle relaxation, whereas an increase in cAMP in the absence of myosin dephosphorylation is insufficient to cause relaxation. Moreover, myosin dephosphorylation appears to be a common step in the cAMP-independent and cAMP-dependent mechanisms for airway muscle relaxation.\r"

Animals were ventilated with 100% O2 and zero end-expiratory pressure. Base-line hemodynamic and blood gas observations were obtained 90-120 min following OA. Observations were repeated 30 min after infusion of meclofenamate (2 mg/kg; n = 10), or after saline (n = 6). Resistance to pulmonary blood flow was assessed using the difference between pulmonary arterial diastolic and left atrial pressures (PDG). Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions were derived with the multiple inert gas technique. Prior to infusion, there were no significant differences between the two groups. PDG was elevated mildly above normal levels, and shunt flow was the principal gas exchange disturbance. Saline induced no significant changes in hemodynamics or gas exchange. Meclofenamate enhanced PDG to a small, significant degree and effected a 32% reduction in shunt flow (P less than 0.01). Perfusion was redistributed to normal VA/Q units with little change in low VA/Q perfusion or in overall flow. Arterial PO2 rose from 75 +/- 36 to 184 +/- 143 Torr (P less than 0.05). At autopsy, there were no significant differences in wet to dry lung weights. Prostaglandin inhibition redistributes perfusion from shunt to normal VA/Q units, thereby improving arterial PO2, without altering lung water acutely.\r"

Data were obtained from experiments where 13 healthy male volunteers were totally immersed under resting and nude conditions for 1 h in water temperatures of 20 and 28 degrees C. At these temperatures, the mean measured rectal temperature (Tre) fell by approximately 0.9 and 0.5 degrees C, respectively, yet mean measured metabolic rate (M) rose by approximately 275 and 90 W for the low body fat group (n = 7) and 195 and 45 W for the moderate body fat group (n = 6). To predict the observed Tre and M values, the present model 1) included thermal inputs for shivering from the skin independent of their inclusion with the central temperature to account for the observed initial rapid rise in M, 2) determined a thermally neutral body temperature profile such that the measured and predicted initial values of Tre and M were matched, 3) confined the initial shivering to the trunk region to avoid an overly large predicted initial rate of rectal cooling, and 4) calculated the steady-state convective heat loss by assuming a zero heat storage in the skin compartment to circumvent the acute sensitivity to the small skin-water temperature difference when using conventional methods. The last three modifications are unique to thermoregulatory modeling.\r"

The effects of total spinal anesthesia on the response were studied in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Before total spinal anesthesia, main pulmonary arterial balloon inflation increased pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance without affecting systemic hemodynamic variables. Both right and left pulmonary arterial pressures were monitored to exclude unilateral obstruction with main pulmonary arterial balloon inflation. Total spinal anesthesia decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial pressures. After total spinal anesthesia, main pulmonary arterial distension still increased pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance. Right atrial pacing, discontinuation of halothane anesthesia, and norepinephrine infusion during total spinal anesthesia partially reversed the hemodynamic changes caused by total spinal anesthesia. The percent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to main pulmonary arterial distension was similar before total spinal anesthesia and during all experimental conditions during total spinal anesthesia. The pulmonary hypertensive response is therefore not dependent on central synaptic connections.\r"

To determine whether post-exercise hypotension would occur in spontaneously hypertensive rats and to test the hypothesis that any reductions would result because of decreases in regional vascular resistances, hypertensive rats (n = 19) were instrumented with indwelling arterial catheters and Doppler probes to measure regional blood flows from the iliac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries. Data were collected from animals who performed a 20- and a 40-min treadmill test at between 60 and 70% of their maximum O2 uptake. When the animals ran for 20 min, there was a pre- to postexercise drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 158 +/- 3.6 to 150 +/- 3.6 mmHg (P less than 0.05), which was recorded 30 min after the exercise had ceased. The pre- to postexercise reduction in MAP after 40 min of treadmill running was from 154 +/- 3.1 to 138 +/- 3.0 mmHg (P less than 0.05) as recorded 30 min postexercise. Postexercise heart rate was significantly lower after the 40-min exercise bout, from a preexercise mean of 351 +/- 3 beats/min to 324 +/- 5 beats/min 30 min after the treadmill had stopped. Surprisingly, marked pre- to postexercise reductions in regional vascular resistance were not observed in either the iliac, superior mesenteric, or renal vascular beds. These data demonstrated the existence of postexercise hypotension in genetic hypertensive rats and suggested that reductions in cardiac output were the primary hemodynamic mechanism for this finding.\r"

After an initial maximum cycle ergometer test to determine the subjects' control VO2max, subjects were administered each of three medications: placebo, atenolol (100 mg once daily), and propranolol (80 mg twice daily), in a randomized double-blind fashion. Each medication period was 5 days in length and was followed by a 4-day washout period. On the 3rd day of each medication period, subjects performed a maximal cycle ergometer test. On the final day of each medication period, subjects exercised at 40% of their control VO2max for 90 min on a cycle ergometer in a warm (31.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C) moderately humid (44.7 +/- 4.7%) environment. beta-Blockade caused significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in VO2max, maximal minute ventilation (VEmax), maximal heart rate (HRmax), and maximal exercise time. Significantly greater decreases in VO2max, VEmax, and HRmax were associated with the propranolol compared with the atenolol treatment. During the 90-min submaximal rides, beta-blockade significantly reduced heart rate. Substantially lower values for O2 consumption (VO2) and minute ventilation (VE) were observed with propranolol compared with atenolol or placebo. Furthermore, VO2 drift and HR drift were observed under atenolol and placebo conditions but not with propranolol. Respiratory exchange ratio decreased significantly over time during the placebo and atenolol trials but did not change during the propranolol trial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subject lay prone, with the neck slightly extended and the chin resting on a soft-padded support at the edge of the table. The chin support was then removed, and the subject maximally flexed and lowered the neck. This was followed by return to the initial position. Neck flexion caused a rapid decrease in blood flow in both forearm and calf; at 30 s this averaged 39 and 35%, respectively. The flow in both forearm and calf gradually recovered as the neck flexion was sustained and approached the control values at the end of 10 min. The blood flow at the ankle was unchanged, indicating that the decrease occurred in the skeletal muscles. The arterial blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged; thus the decrease in flow was due to vasoconstriction. The fact that the decrease was evident as soon as the head was lowered indicated that it was nervously mediated. Neither contraction of the flexor muscles of the neck nor venous congestion of the head, in the absence of the head-down position, altered the blood flow. Although the mechanism of the decrease in flow has not been determined, the studies demonstrate that in response to certain stimuli, the resistance vessels in the skeletal muscles of the forearm and calf undergo a similar nervously mediated vasoconstriction.\r"

In lobes suspended in air, an approximately linear alveolar plateau (AP) was obtained. The AP during foam immersion was markedly curvilinear, with phase IV seen at end expiration. The observed AP during foam immersion could be predicted by a mathematical model that assumed a homogeneous transpulmonary pressure-regional volume relationship equal to the overall pressure-volume (PV) relationship measured with the lobe suspended in air. The accuracy of this model was further confirmed by measuring the washout of nitrogen injected into different lung regions through alveolar capsules. We also used the model to examine the relationship between the onset of dependent airway closure and two of its proposed indicators: the onset of phase IV and the inflection point of the overall PV relationship. In most lobes, the lung volume at the onset of phase IV was less than the modeled lung volume at dependent airway closure. The lung volume at the inflection point was always less than the modeled lung volume at dependent airway closure. We show that the overall PV relationship measured in lobes suspended in air provides an accurate estimate of regional PV relationships during foam immersion.\r"

Muscle concentrations of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PC), La, glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), and creatine were determined, and pH was measured. The O2 deficit was 128 +/- 32 (SD) ml/kg (64 +/- 13 liters). The O2 debt was 324 +/- 62 ml/kg (159 +/- 37 liters), approximately two to three times comparative values for human beings.

In six patients with obstructive sleep apnea, we applied incremental levels of positive pressure through a nasal mask during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. A positive critical opening pressure (Pcrit) of 3.3 +/- 3.3 (SD) cmH2O was demonstrated. As nasal pressure was raised above Pcrit, inspiratory airflow increased in proportion to the level of positive pressure applied until apneas were abolished (P less than 0.01). However, at pressures greater than Pcrit, esophageal pressures either did not correlate or correlated inversely with inspiratory airflow provided that esophageal pressure was less than Pcrit. When pressure was applied to a full face mask, inspiratory airflow did not occur and Pcrit could not be obtained at pressures well above Pcrit demonstrated with the nasal mask. These results are consistent with the view that the upper airway functions as a Starling resistor with a collapsible segment in the oropharynx. These findings offer a unifying construct for the association of sleep apnea, periodic hypopnea, and snoring.\r"

Work load was increased to 40% in a stepwise manner (phase I, min 0-16) followed by a period at 80% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) sustained to exhaustion. On one day, exercise was preceded by a double cold exposure (precooling test, PRET), resulting in a 204-kJ/m2 negative heat storage and a 4 and 0.2 degrees C lower mean skin and core temperature at the start of exercise compared with the control test (CONT). Core temperature dropped further during exercise in PRET. Endurance time at 80% of peak VO2 was increased by 12% (P less than 0.05) in PRET. Heart rate (HR) was decreased throughout PRET (P less than 0.05); oxygen pulse and arteriovenous O2 difference were significantly increased in phase I of PRET, whereas the PRET-CONT differences in stroke volume and cardiac output were not significant. In phase II of PRET (min 16-28, heavy exercise) sweat rate (SR) and heat conductivity, indicating forearm blood flow, were lower (-39%, P less than 0.001; -37%). Pedal rate (PR) was 9% lower (P less than 0.01) in phase II of PRET. At the termination of exercise, PRET-CONT differences in HR, SR, and PR had disappeared.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that almitrine, a peripheral chemoreceptor stimulant, increased tidal volume (VT), expired minute ventilation (VE), and respiratory frequency (f) and decreased inspiratory (TI) and expiratory time (TE) in sleeping adult cats. We now hypothesized that almitrine would induce an increase in ventilation in a young animal model. Respiration was studied by the barometric method in 11 unanesthetized New Zealand White rabbit pups between 3 and 6 days of age. Recordings were made in 0.21 FIO2 at base line and after cumulative intraperitoneal infusions of almitrine (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/kg). The chamber pressure deflection (proportional to VT after appropriate calculation) was computer sampled at 200 Hz. At least 100 breaths for each dose in each animal were analyzed. We found that a 7.5-mg/kg intraperitoneal dose of almitrine increased f to 135 +/- 9% (SE) of base line and decreased TE and TI to 72 +/- 8% and 79 +/- 8% of base line, respectively. Changes in VE, VT/TI, and VT were not significant. Recognizing that apnea is associated with inadequate ventilation and a prolonged TE (failure of the \"inspiratory on-switch\"), these results, particularly the increase in f and decrease in TE, suggest that almitrine might be useful in treating apnea in preterm infants.\r"

  ".U": "88227750\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies on respiratory impedance (Zrs) have predicted that at frequencies greater than 64 Hz a second resonance will occur. Furthermore, if one intends to fit a model more complicated than the simple series combination of a resistance, inertance, and compliance to Zrs data, the only way to ensure statistically reliable parameter estimates is to include data surrounding this second resonance. An additional question, however, is whether the resulting parameters are physiologically meaningful. We obtained input impedance data from eight healthy adult humans using discrete frequency forced oscillations from 4 to 200 Hz. Three resonant frequencies were seen: 8 +/- 2, 151 +/- 10, and 182 +/- 16 Hz. A seven-parameter lumped element model provided an excellent fit to the data in all subjects. This model consists of an airway resistance (Raw), which is linearly dependent on frequency, and airway inertance separated from a tissue resistance, inertance, and compliance by a shunt compliance (Cg) thought to represent gas compressibility. Model estimates of Raw and Cg were compared with those suggested by measurement of Raw and thoracic gas volume using a plethysmograph. In all subjects the model Raw and Cg were significantly lower than and not correlated with the corresponding plethysmographic measurement. We hypothesize that the statistically reliable but physiologically inconsistent parameters are a consequence of the distorting influence of airway wall compliance and/or airway quarter-wave resonance. Such factors are not inherent to the seven-parameter model.\r"

Pressurization of lung vessels and left heart and oleic acid injury were individually imposed on anesthetized open-chest dogs perfused with an external pump and gas exchanger. Lungs were inflated in steps before and during those stimuli. The HB reflex was evaluated from graphs of breathing frequency (fr) vs. airway pressure. Congestion itself had no significant sustained effect on fr, but it slightly depressed the HB reflex. Oleic acid tachypnea that was depressed to pretreatment fr by inflation, implying enhancement of the HB response. Capsaicin and oleic acid had similar effects. Vagal cooling to 8 degrees C slightly depressed the effects of oleic acid and capsaicin, had no effect on the sustained fr response to congestion, and reversed the inhibitory effect of inflation. A stimulation of breathing or an enhancement of the HB reflex by congestion was not confirmed, but oleic acid increased fr and the HB reflex.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the respiratory effects of cigarette smoke, 5% histamine aerosol, and dust in unanesthetized 1- to 7-day-old rabbits in a body plethysmograph. Cigarette smoke immediately provoked the animal's arousal and irregular breathing. Histamine and dust had no effect in some of the youngest animals. In others, 5-15 s from the onset of the exposure to either of the two stimuli, respiratory rate increased and the depth of breathing decreased. These changes were more pronounced with age. The fact that effects of dust and aerosol lessened with time of exposure showed adaptation to the stimuli. The age dependence of the reflex response was also observed after injection of 50 micrograms of histamine per kilogram into the external jugular vein in anesthetized (50 mg ketamine + 3 mg acepromazine per kg) and tracheostomized rabbits during the 1st wk of life. In 1-day-old animals, a short-lasting excitation was followed by apnea or a prolongation of expiratory phase. Peak amplitude of the diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi) increased in all animals, but only in the youngest was the EMGdi increase paralleled by an increase in tidal volume. In vagotomized animals or animals pretreated with H1-blocker, histamine never affected timing parameters in animals greater than 1 day old. In the youngest animals, respiratory depression due to histamine was not abolished after vagotomy or promethazine. The results imply that inputs from the upper airways and the rapidly adapting pulmonary mechanoreceptors exert their effects on the pattern of breathing immediately after birth in rabbits. The importance of those inputs increases with maturation.\r"

Conventional approaches using pooled subject data to increase the degree of freedom for statistical inference are enervated by the resultant introduction of intersubject variability. This paper proposes a new, simple method of pooling multiple subject data for linearity analysis. With the use of a special standardization procedure for the individual response curves, this method allows sensitive detection of occult nonlinearities as well as any state-dependent variability in the underlying relationship. Application of this analytic approach to reported hypercapnic exercise-response data in eight healthy subjects showed that 1) the hypercapnic ventilation-CO2 output relationship is nonlinear with a downward concavity; and 2) the ventilation-tidal volume relationship, which is linear at low tidal volume values, is similar in hypercapnic exercise as in resting hypercapnia or eucapnic exercise.\r"

The rigid-needle and membrane osmometers showed excellent correlation (y = 1.00x + 0.06; r greater than 0.99). The flexible-needle osmometer tended to overestimate osmotic pressure (avg 16%). We used the rigid-needle osmometer for continuous measurements of protein osmotic pressure of blood and lymph in anesthetized or unanesthetized sheep to observe changes in protein osmotic pressure of blood and lymph through the three different interventions. The relationship between the theoretical values (x) and the continuous measurements (y) of osmotic pressure was good (y = 0.99x + 0.16, r = 0.97), but after various interventions, the continuously measured protein osmotic pressure tended to exceed the calculated measurements. The continuous measurement should be monitored with spot samples measured in a stationary osmometer or by calculation of osmotic pressure from total protein concentration and albumin fraction.\r"

After intravenous pentobarbital sodium (25 mg/kg), we exposed the left lung through a wide left thoracotomy, which required rib excision. Through a double-lumen endotracheal tube, we ventilated the right lung to maintain normal blood gases and pH while we held the left lung motionless at an inflation pressure of 5 cmH2O. To reduce motion on the surface of the left lower lobe, we resected the left upper lobe, placed a Plexiglas baffle between the lobe and the heart, and held the lobe surface in a suction ring. In accordance with procedures we have previously described, we micropunctured subpleural vessels to measure microvascular pressure. At base line when alveolar pressure exceeded left atrial pressure (zone 2 conditions), 21, 38, and 41% of the total pressure drop occurred, respectively, in the arterial, microvascular, and venous segments. When we raised left atrial pressure above alveolar pressure (zone 3 conditions), the corresponding pressure drops were 30, 55, and 20% of total. The blood flow in the superficial layer of the lung averaged 15% less than the flow in the deeper layers as measured by distribution of 99mTc-albumin macroaggregates. We conclude that the intact and the isolated lung preparations in dog exhibit similar distributions of subpleural microvascular pressure.\r"

The myosin isozyme patterns shifted in both S and R groups from a predominantly V1 isozyme form (63.8%) at 10 mo of age to a more equal distribution of isozyme forms at 24 mo (V1, V2, and V3 comprising 40.0, 27.8, and 31.9%, respectively). Age-related shifts in myosin composition occurred despite chronic endurance training at an intensity of approximately 75% maximum O2 consumption. Improvement of cardiac performance through training during aging is not accompanied by attenuating shifts in myosin isozyme composition.\r"

Saline-injected animals ran 74.9 +/- 16.5 (SD) min, whereas cocaine-treated rats ran only 29 +/- 11.6 min. The drug had no effect on resting blood glucose or lactate levels, nor did it affect resting glycogen levels in liver or red and white vastus muscle. However, it did reduce resting soleus glycogen content by 30%. During exercise liver and soleus glycogen depletion occurred at the same rate in saline- and cocaine-treated animals. In contrast, the rate of glycogen depletion during exercise in red and white vastus was markedly increased in cocaine-treated rats with a corresponding elevation in blood lactate (12 vs. only 5 mM in saline group) at exhaustion. These data suggest that cocaine administration (20 mg/kg) before submaximal exercise dramatically alters glycogen metabolism during exercise, and this effect has a negative impact on exercise endurance.\r"

Seventy-seven per cent of patients reviewed were improved subjectively, and 83% of patients who were examined had objective evidence of only minor instability or none at follow-up. However, only a few patients had \"normal\" knees and many continued to have minor symptoms of instability with some restriction of activity. Most of the unsatisfactory results were in patients with significant chondral pathology at the time of reconstruction. While an extra-articular pivot-shift repair did not correct all the symptoms and signs completely, most patients were improved subjectively and objectively, and there were few complications.\r"

In all these patients vascular surgery had failed or not been possible, and they were threatened by amputation; they suffered from trophic lesions, or pain at rest, or both. The great toe SBP averaged 10 mmHg (range 0 to 60 mmHg) and the pedal tcPO2 10 mmHg (range 2 to 45 mmHg). After six minutes of oxygen inhalation there was an increase in pedal tcPO2 of 9 mmHg (0 to 50 mmHg). After a follow-up period averaging 7 months (range 10 days to 13 months), 13 patients underwent an amputation and nine (five of whom had been amputated) died. The great toe SBP in the patients who required amputation was initially lower than in those who did not. The pedal tcPO2 also was lower in amputated than in non-amputated patients. There was no amputation in the group showing an increase of at least 10 mmHg after six minutes of oxygen inhalation; and conversely, all patients in whom the pedal tcPO2 increased less than 10 mmHg were amputated. Thus increase in the pedal tcPO2 after oxygen inhalation appears the best criterion for estimating the prognosis of severely ischaemic limbs.\r"

The progression of joint destruction was different in each type, but despite the severe destructive changes seen in radiographs, the patients had relatively few complaints. The muscles innervated by the peroneal nerve were severely paralysed in ankle and midtarsal types and it seems that, over a long term, repeated trauma and/or abnormal stress may lead to these types of neuroarthropathy. Neuropathy was less severe in the tarsometatarsal type of joint degeneration; the pathogenesis in this type seemed to be mainly direct trauma to the forefoot.\r"

The surgically removed tumors were studied by morphological techniques, and the findings were correlated with clinical and biochemical data. All tumors were macroadenomas, often with parasellar extension. The histologically diffuse tumors frequently exhibited focal immunopositivity for one or more adenohypophysial hormones, although the majority of adenoma cells were negative. The tumors had characteristic electron microscopic features, assuring specific diagnosis and delineating this tumor type as a distinct ultrastructural entity. The tumors were removed from 9 women and 11 men (median ages, 27 and 41 yr, respectively). In all women, mild to moderate hyperprolactinemia and its sequelae were present from the early phase of the disease, leading to the erroneous diagnosis of prolactinoma. Bromocriptine therapy (3 patients) reduced serum PRL levels to normal, but failed to halt tumor growth. In men, most adenomas were nonfunctioning; 4 men had mild to moderate hyperprolactinemia. Three men had elevated serum GH levels and acromegaly, suggestive of multidirectional differentiation. Although the putative cell type giving rise to silent subtype 3 adenomas is not known, the tumor should be recognized to avoid erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate treatment.\r"

Additionally and independently, skeletal blood flow correlated with an index of the work rate of the osteoblasts in each multicellular unit of bone (the corrected apposition rate of Parfitt). These correlations were statistically significant in both the untreated patients (P less than 0.05) and the whole group (P less than 0.001). Further indices related to bone turnover at the level of the skeleton as a whole were significantly associated with skeletal blood flow only in the combined group.\r"

Their mean testicular volume increased from 5.5 +/- 1.1 (+/- SE) mL (pretreatment) to 10.8 +/- 1.6 mL (maximum) during treatment (P less than 10(-6)). The maximum mean testicular volume was highly positively correlated with initial volume (r = 0.84; P less than 10(-6)). All men attained normal serum testosterone levels, and 7 of 22 men achieved supraphysiological serum estradiol levels. During hCG treatment, 14 of the 22 men had sperm appear in their semen. Six of 11 men with complete gonadotropin deficiency, defined as an initial mean testicular volume less than 4 mL, became sperm positive during hCG treatment. In contrast, 9 of 11 men with partial gonadotropin deficiency (initial mean testicular volume of 4 mL or more) produced sperm during treatment (P less than 0.001). Sperm concentration was highly positively correlated with both pretreatment (r = 0.65; P less than 0.01) and final testicular volume (r = 0.73; P less than 0.0001). Of 13 men attempting to impregnate their partners, 7 were successful in initiating conception; a total of 8 pregnancies ensued. The sperm concentration at the time of conception was less than 10 million/mL in all but 1 man. Our study demonstrates that hCG, in the absence of exogenous FSH, can complete spermiogenesis in men with partial gonadotropin deficiency. The response to hCG in men with IHH is predicted by the initial testicular volume.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the cause of the low serum progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels that occur in women with an ectopic pregnancy. Only women who had been amenorrheic for less than 8 weeks were studied in order to assess corpus luteum rather than placental biosynthesis of these steroids; each woman with an ectopic pregnancy was matched to a woman with a normal intrauterine pregnancy on the basis of serum intact hCG levels within 10% of one another to obviate the influence of different levels of this luteotropic hormone. Every woman with an ectopic pregnancy had lower serum progesterone, estradiol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels than her matched normal pregnant pairmate (median values: progesterone, 27.9 vs. 83.5 mmol/L; estradiol, 0.36 vs. 1.79 nmol/L; 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 4.95 vs. 22.1 nmol/L, respectively; all P less than 0.002). The ratios of intact hCG, measured by immunoradiometric assay, to hCG, measured by a hCG beta-specific RIA, were similar in the two groups. Serum hCG bioactivity was assayed by measuring the ability of serum to stimulate testosterone secretion from mouse Leydig cells. The mean biological to intact immunological hCG ratios were 2.06 +/- 1.39 (+/- SD) for ectopic pregnancy and 1.91 +/- 0.81 for normal pregnancy (P greater than 0.05). The biological hCG to immunoreactive hCG beta ratios were 1.98 +/- 0.75 and 2.02 +/- 0.82, respectively. Serum hCG from both groups of women stimulated cAMP generation by testicular cells similarly. We conclude that the lower serum steroid levels in women with ectopic pregnancy cannot be explained by altered hCG bioactivity. The lower steroid levels may thus reflect a primary defect of the corpus luteum, absence of another stimulator of ovarian steroid biosynthesis, or more subtle alterations in hCG glycosylation which are important in vivo but not assessed by the in vitro bioassay.\r"

  ".W": "This work was undertaken to study the heterogeneity of GH in serum and placental and pituitary extracts and to study GH physiology in pregnant women. Two distinct monoclonal antihuman GH (anti-hGH) antibodies (MAb) coded 5B4 and K24 were selected for their high binding affinity and specificity. The 5B4 MAb recognized the epitope comprising the NH2-terminal end of hGH, and the K24 MAb recognized an internal epitope. Both MAbs were used in RIAs to measure serum GH concentrations in various circumstances, including pregnancy. The two RIAs yielded slightly different serum GH results in normal men and nonpregnant women, but the overall correlation between the data was excellent. Since the RIAs were not affected by human placental lactogen, the evolution of serum GH in pregnant women could be studied. In such women, serum GH levels progressively declined to undetectable levels during the second half of pregnancy, while a pregnancy-associated serum GH-like antigen [tentatively called human placental growth hormone (PGH)] appeared in the circulation at midpregnancy and increased thereafter up to term. PGH contained the NH2-terminal epitope of pituitary GH, but lacked the internal one. Consequently, it reacted selectively with the 5B4 MAb only. After delivery, PGH disappeared from maternal serum within 1 h. Amniotic fluid contained low GH concentrations; cord serum contained high GH levels, but no PGH. Thus, PGH appears to be secreted selectively into the maternal compartment. PGH was purified from term placenta extracts. According to its chromatographic behavior, it appears more basic than pituitary 22K and 20K GHs. Size dimorphism was demonstrated; PGH was composed of two entities of 22K and 25K, respectively. Pure PGH, obtained in small quantities by preparative electrophoresis, was found to bind to hepatic GH receptor with an apparent high potency compared to that of pituitary GH, PGH, thus, should act in vivo as a GH agonist sharing most of its biological properties. These results lead to the conclusion that PGH is likely to replace the pituitary hormone in governing maternal metabolism during the second half of pregnancy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether acute alcohol ingestion altered the effects of naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist, on pituitary, adrenal, and gonadal hormones in normal women. Fourteen women were studied during the early follicular phase (between days 2 and 4) of their menstrual cycle. Plasma LH, PRL, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol concentrations were measured before and after administration of 50 mg naltrexone, orally, and alcohol or placebo solution given 1 h after naltrexone, under double blind conditions. Naltrexone significantly increased mean plasma LH (P = 0.02), PRL (P = 0.003), E2 (P less than 0.03), and cortisol (P less than 0.001) levels. Alcohol significantly augmented the naltrexone-stimulated increases in plasma LH (P = 0.006), estradiol (P less than 0.004), and cortisol (P less than 0.001) levels and significantly decreased plasma progesterone levels (P = 0.001). Plasma PRL increased (P = 0.001) to the same extent after naltrexone and alcohol ingestion or naltrexone and placebo. We conclude that alcohol enhances naltrexone-induced increases in plasma gonadotropins and adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones in women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.\r"

Tissue was obtained from three patients undergoing surgery for thyroid disease, three patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal insufficiency, and four patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. Addition of lithium in concentrations equivalent to the therapeutic serum levels normally attained in man (1.3 mmol/L) resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in PTH release under normocalcemic (1.15 mmol/L) conditions from normal and hyperplastic tissues. The magnitude of the lithium-induced response of PTH release ranged from a 1.4- to 5.3-fold increase above basal levels (perifusion with 1.15 mmol/L calcium alone) and was comparable to the response during a low calcium (0.42 mmol/L) perifusion. Although the response to lithium was delayed compared to that of hypocalcemia, PTH returned to basal levels immediately after removal of either stimulator. In contrast, parathyroid adenomas did not respond to either lithium or hypocalcemia in a characteristic manner, but, rather, functioned in an autonomous fashion with repeated pulsatile bursts of PTH release that were not suppressible even under hypercalcemic (1.70 mmol/L) conditions. These in vitro studies suggest that lithium therapy may elevate serum PTH levels in some patients and could, thus, be responsible for hypercalcemia in them.\r"

Freshly voided urine was ultrafiltered and concentrated, and the molecular species of immunoreactive hCG were separated by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. All urine samples contained the beta-core fragment, which eluted after the alpha-subunit of hCG. This fragment lacked the carboxy-terminal epitope of hCG, was inactive as an in vitro bioassay, and adsorbed to Concanavalin-A. The beta-core fragment was a major form the immunoreactive hCG in urine throughout pregnancy and accounted for over 90% of the immunoreactive hCG in urine from midpregnancy. The excretion pattern of the beta-core fragment can account for the low biological to immunological ratio of urinary hCG that occurs at different stages of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing pituitary adenomectomy are usually given glucocorticoid therapy, although there are no data to document the need for such therapy. We prospectively studied hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function in 88 consecutive pituitary adenoma patients before and after selective adenomectomy, excluding those with corticotroph adenomas. Preoperatively, 5 patients had adrenal insufficiency (AI); they were treated with glucocorticoids and excluded from the analysis. The remaining 83 patients had normal HPA function preoperatively and were not given glucocorticoids before, during, or immediately after surgery, but were closely monitored, and their serum cortisol levels were measured in the immediate postoperative period. Two patients were clinically suspected to have AI postoperatively and were treated accordingly. The remaining 81 patients had no clinical manifestations of AI and received no glucocorticoid therapy. Their serum cortisol levels in the immediate postoperative period were appropriately elevated. The mean serum cortisol level was 40.5 +/- 11.1 (+/- SD) micrograms/dL (1117 +/- 306 nmol/L) 6 h after surgery; serum cortisol levels decreased gradually thereafter. Morning serum cortisol levels were within the normal range on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days after surgery: day 4, 15.1 +/- 7.0 micrograms/dL (417 +/- 193 nmol/L); day 5, 16.4 +/- 5.6 micrograms/dL (453 +/- 155 nmol/L); and day 6, 16.3 +/- 5.7 micrograms/dL (450 +/- 157 nmol/L). When tested 3 months after surgery, all 81 patients had normal HPA function. We conclude that HPA function is rarely compromised after selective pituitary adenomectomy. Close observation and serum cortisol measurements in the immediate postoperative period can reliably predict the integrity of the HPA after surgery. Routine glucocorticoid therapy is not needed in patients undergoing selective adenomectomy whose preoperative adrenal function is normal.\r"

The purified FRP was used to produce a monoclonal antibody which was used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay suitable for quantitation of FRP in urine. Twelve normal premenopausal women underwent daily collection of blood and first morning urine samples, beginning on the 1st day of menses, as well as daily ultrasonographic evaluation of follicular diameter, beginning on the 10th day of the menstrual cycle, until the onset of the next menses. Serum estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH levels were determined by RIA. Urinary FRP levels increased in the midfollicular phase, reached their zenith in the midluteal phase [mean, 0.38 +/- 0.03 (+/- SE) immunoreactive units; 1 immunoreactive unit = approximately 1 ng FRP/mL.mg creatinine], and then declined to reach their nadir (not detectable) during the early follicular phase. Immunohistochemical evaluation of ovarian tissue demonstrated that anti-FRP localized to mural granulosa cells in viable follicles, to all follicular epithelial cells in atretic follicles, and to the large cells of the corpus luteum. These findings indicate that immunoreactive FRP levels in urine change during the menstrual cycle and suggest a relationship among FRP, follicular maturation, and corpus luteum formation.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is one of a number of mitogenic factors in the serum of animals and humans. We demonstrated previously that IGF-I is a potent mitogen for FRTL5 cells, a line of rat thyroid follicular cells. In this study, we assessed the relevance of this finding with respect to the levels of IGF-I found in human serum by comparing the effects of normal serum and serum from patients with untreated acromegaly or hypopituitarism on DNA synthesis in quiescent FRTL5 cells. As expected, when added to cells maintained in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% BSA, but devoid of insulin, transferrin, TSH, or calf serum, normal serum produced a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. A similar, but more marked, effect was produced by the addition of serum from patients with untreated acromegaly. In multiple experiments, a standard concentration (0.5%) of acromegaly serum was more stimulatory to DNA synthesis than was normal serum. In a single experiment designed to eliminate interassay variation and define the relationship between the ability of serum to stimulate DNA synthesis and its IGF-I concentration, studies were performed with 0.5% concentrations of serum from 9 normal subjects, 15 patients with untreated acromegaly, and 3 patients with panhypopituitarism. On the average, [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of serum from patients with acromegaly was approximately 3 times, and that in the presence of serum from patients with hypopituitarism only one fourth, that in the presence of serum from normal subjects; there was no overlap of individual values in the three groups. For the entire study group, we found a highly significant correlation (r = 0.86) between the serum IGF-I concentration and the ability of that serum to stimulate thymidine incorporation into the DNA of FRTL5 cells. The stimulatory effects of serum from both normal and acromegalic subjects were decreased or abolished by the addition of a monoclonal antibody against IGF-I. In hypophysectomized rats, GH increases the thyroid to body weight ratio and enhances the effect of TSH to promote thyroid growth. Further, an inordinate frequency of nontoxic goiter in patients with acromegaly has been reported. Taken together with these observations, our findings suggest that the effect of IGF-I to promote thyroid cell growth in vitro has a counterpart in the living animal or patient.\r"

To determine whether bone mass is increased in them, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, trochanter, and femoral neck was measured by dual photon absorptiometry in 89 nonobese white and 51 nonobese black women, all of whom were within 30% of their ideal body weight and between the ages of 20 and 50 yr, and in 21 obese white women and 21 obese black women, all of whom weighed 30% on more than their ideal body weight and were in the same age range.

Saturation analysis of anterior pituitary tissues from monkeys receiving various treatments revealed an apparent mean dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.53 +/- 0.17 (+/- SE) X 10(-10) mol/L (n = 3) for [3H]R1881 (androgen) binding to cytosol, 2.6 +/- 0.50 X 10(-10) mol/L (n = 3) for [3H]R2858 (estrogen) binding to cytosol, 1.7 X 10(-10) mol/L (n = 2) for [3H]R5020 (progestin) binding to cytosol, and 6.2 X 10(-10) mol/L (n = 2) for [3H )R1881 binding to cell nuclear extract. The highest levels of nuclear androgen receptor (AR) were found in intact males [37.1 +/- 3.5 (+/- SE) fmol/mg DNA; n = 7] and castrated males treated with T for 6 weeks (89.7 +/- 30.2 fmol/mg DNA; n = 5). High levels of nuclear AR corresponded to serum T levels and low serum LH levels. Nuclear AR was undetectable in castrated males and castrated males treated with E. Significantly greater levels of cytosolic AR were detected in intact males (27.5 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein) compared to all other groups (P less than 0.05). T or E treatment had no effect on cytosolic AR. Increased levels of cytosolic progestin receptor were found in intact monkeys and after E or T treatment compared to levels in untreated castrates. No differences in 5 alpha-reductase activity were found between any treatment groups. These data indicate that anterior pituitary nuclear androgen receptor is correlated with serum LH levels and support the hypothesis of a direct action of T on anterior pituitary LH secretion. In addition, it appears that cytosolic progestin receptor, but not AR, is regulated by estrogen in intact male rhesus monkeys. In the posterior pituitary, AR dynamics followed a profile in which cytosolic AR increased after castration and decreased after T treatment. Nuclear AR decreased after castration and increased after T treatment. The presence of a dynamic AR system in the posterior pituitary suggests hormonal regulation of its function by androgens.\r"

  ".W": "Previously reported data with regard to the effects of estrogen on plasma somatomedin-C (Sm-C) concentrations are contradictory. This study was designed to evaluate, in the same subjects with Turner's syndrome, the effects of both acute high dose and chronic low dose estrogen treatment on plasma Sm-C concentrations. Eight girls with Turner's syndrome, aged 10 8/12 to 14 9/12 yr, were admitted to the Clinical Research Center for 3 days. Each received an iv infusion of conjugated estrogens (1.25 or 2.5 mg) in 12 h. Plasma Sm-C and serum GH and estrone levels were measured before, during, and after the infusion. The mean serum concentrations in the girls who received 1.25 mg conjugated estrogen increased from less than 222 pmol/L to 1905 +/- 240 (+/- SE), 825 +/- 166, and 296 +/- 74 pmol/L immediately after, 12 h after, and 24 h after completion of the infusion, respectively. Serum GH concentrations were undetectable (less than 1 microgram/L) before, during, and after the infusion. The mean plasma Sm-C concentrations decreased significantly (P = 0.02) after the infusion was terminated, falling from a mean basal value of 1.3 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) to a nadir of 0.6 +/- 0.1 U/mL 12 h after completion of the infusion. The same girls then were treated with low dose (5 micrograms ethinyl estradiol) estrogen therapy for 9-14 months. Seven of the eight girls had an increase in growth rate. The mean growth rate increased from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 5.4 +/- 0.8 and 3.8 +/- 0.4 cm/yr from 3 to 6 (P less than 0.05) and from 9 to 14 months of treatment, respectively. Individual variability was great, however, and two of the eight girls never grew at a rate faster than 4.0 cm/yr during therapy. No consistent alteration in bone age relative to chronological age was found, and the growth response was not predicted by the bone age at the beginning of treatment. Mean plasma Sm-C concentrations did not change. These studies demonstrated a growth spurt in girls with Turner's syndrome during chronic low dose estrogen therapy, which was not associated with any change in plasma Sm-C concentrations. Acute high dose iv estrogen infusion resulted in a significant decline in plasma Sm-C concentrations. These results support the concept that in girls with Turner's syndrome the plasma Sm-C response to estrogen is influenced by multiple, as yet undefined, factors.\r"

Fetal liver and muscle specifically bound [125I]hPL. This binding was inhibited by increasing concentrations of unlabeled hPL (half-maximal concentrations, 2.2 and 3.4 nmol/L, respectively). Scatchard analysis of the hepatic membrane binding revealed curvilinear plots with higher (Kd, 2.2 nmol/L) and lower (Kd, 24 nmol/L) affinity sites, while binding to muscle involved a single receptor class of Kd 5.6 nmol/L. The binding capacities for the two hepatic sites correlated positively with fetal body weight. [125I]hGH specifically bound to liver, but not muscle, with higher (Kd, 1.6 nmol/L) and lower (Kd, 8.6 nmol/L) affinity sites. [125I]PRL bound to hepatic membranes, but was preferentially displaced by hPL or hGH. Between 4 and 500 micrograms/L (mean, 82 micrograms/L, 3.8 nmol/L) hPL were present in fetal plasma. The findings identify distinct hPL receptors in human fetal liver and skeletal muscle and a hepatic hGH receptor in midgestation.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamics of LH secretion and clearance were studied in vivo in eight healthy young men using a novel multiple parameter deconvolution procedure to resolve underlying secretion and clearance rates simultaneously from serial serum immunoactive LH concentrations. This deconvolution analysis disclosed random LH secretory bursts occurring at a mean (+/- SEM) interpulse interval of 72 +/- 5 min. The frequency of these secretory bursts was 6.9 +/- 0.6 episodes/8 h. Each resolved LH secretory event had an average half-duration of only 7.8 +/- 0.5 min, which was remarkably shorter than the LH concentration peak duration of 60 +/- 6 min. The maximal LH secretory rate achieved within a secretory burst averaged 0.40 +/- 0.05 mIU/min.mL (0.14 IU/min.L), which corresponded to a mass of LH released of 3.2 +/- 0.3 mIU/mL distribution vol (IU/L). By linear regression analysis, both the maximal rate and mass of LH released per secretory burst were positively correlated with the duration of the subsequent interpulse interval (P less than 0.001). In physiological experiments, the mass of LH released per secretory burst was increased by iv GnRH injections or primary gonadal failure, and decreased by sc administration of a selective GnRH antagonist (Nal,Glu-GnRH). The mean endogenous LH production rate calculated by deconvolution [180 +/- 40 mIU/min (0.18 IU/min)] was not different from a nominal value of 228 +/- 80 mIU/min (0.228 IU/min) extrapolated from earlier steady state LH infusions. Deconvolution estimated single phase half-times of endogenous LH disappearance of 87 +/- 8 min, were in general harmony with values of 44-106 min obtained previously in four LH-deficient men injected with purified LH. Moreover, creation of synthetic LH series using our deconvolution estimates yielded 24-h LH pulse profiles similar quantitatively and qualitatively to those in normal men. In summary, we applied a new multiple parameter deconvolution procedure to immunoactive LH pulse profiles to discern the nature of physiological LH secretory events and estimate endogenous LH disappearance rates. These studies in normal men have revealed that 1) LH secretory bursts occur every 72 min; their mean half-duration is 7.8 min; and 3.2 mIU/mL (3.2 IU/L) are released per secretory peak; 2) amplitudes of in vivo LH secretory bursts are augmented in primary gonadal failure and/or by exogenous GnRH injections and attenuated by a GnRH antagonist; 3) the duration of a postsecretory pause is proportional to the amplitude of the preceding LH secretory burst; and (4) 95% of total daily LH release occurs in only 5 h/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Tritium-labeled cRNA probes for the HLA-DR alpha-chain DNA sequence revealed significant HLA-DR alpha-chain gene expression in thyroid glands from patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hybridization signals, which were RNA strand specific, were widely distributed over thyroid follicular epithelial cells as well as over areas of lymphoid infiltration, with the highest concentration of HLA-DR alpha-chain mRNA within epithelial cells in Graves' disease follicles adjacent to areas of lymphoid infiltration. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with immunoperoxidase staining of thyroid sections for DR antigen. Thyroid tissue obtained from patients who did not have autoimmune thyroid disease contained no detectable HLA-DR antigen, but in situ hybridization revealed variable levels of HLA-DR alpha-chain mRNA in thyroid epithelial cells in such glands. Some glands had no detectable HLA-DR alpha-chain mRNA levels above background, whereas other adult glands had significant DR-specific mRNA levels. Fetal thyroid tissue, however, was negative for strand-specific HLA-DR alpha-chain transcripts as well as for HLA-DR antigen. These results indicate that thyroid epithelial cells are capable of synthesizing HLA class II antigens. The DR genes were expressed to the highest degree within the thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, where expression was strongly associated with lymphoid infiltration.\r"

  ".U": "88228418\r", 
  ".W": "To determine if there is a familial component to susceptibility to radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms, we studied 572 individuals who were members of 286 sibpairs who received childhood radiation treatment and for whom follow-up information was obtained. Of these 572 individuals, 240 (42.0%) had thyroid neoplasms (benign and malignant), and 75 (13.1%) had surgically confirmed thyroid cancer. To test the null hypothesis, that neoplasm occurred without regard to family membership, it was necessary to take into account each individual's years at risk and known risk factors. These risk factors, analyzed by the proportional hazards model of Cox, were sex, age at time of radiation treatment, and treatment dose. For each individual, we calculated the cumulative hazard that a neoplasm would occur from that individual's specific risk factors and years at risk. Each individual was also assigned an indicator, D = 1 or 0, according to whether a neoplasm had occurred. Finally, for each individual we computed a residual, D minus the cumulative hazard. In the absence of familial effects, positive and negative residuals would be distributed without regard to family membership, whereas residuals would tend to have concordant signs and magnitudes within families if familial effects were present. Permutational methods, therefore, were used to determine whether the sum among families of the products of residuals within sibpairs was too large, compared to random pairing. For all thyroid neoplasms (both benign and malignant), within-family concordance was significant (P = 0.05, the observed sum among families of the products of residuals was larger than 9468 of 9999 permutations). For thyroid cancer considered alone, the same analysis did not demonstrate familial concordance conclusively, but the results were suggestive (P = 0.18). We conclude that in addition to the previously described risk factors of female sex, younger age at radiation exposure, and higher dose, it is likely that there are independent familial risk factors for developing thyroid neoplasms. Whether these are genetic or environmental factors remains to be determined.\r"

The third machine consisted of a series of vertically mounted high-pressure mercury halide lamps equipped with two different filters for selection of wavelengths between 295 and 400 nm or 320 and 400 nm. The horizontal UV output of the mercury halide and UVB fluorescent units was reduced between the UV-emitting areas, and it is advised that patients rotate when using these units.

Only 12 of these patients complained of fatigability and/or myalgia. Electromyography was performed and serum levels of muscle enzymes were measured in all patients. Comparison of thallium 201 exercise recording with the other tests revealed that scan sensitivity is greater than electromyographic and serum muscle enzymes levels. Thallium 201 scans showed abnormal findings in 32 patients and revealed subclinical lesions in 18 patients, while electromyography findings were abnormal in 25 of these 32 patients. Serum enzyme levels were raised in only 8 patients. Thallium 201 scanning proved to be a useful guide for modifying therapy when laboratory data were conflicting. It was useful to evaluate treatment efficacy. Because our data indicate a 100% positive predictive value, we believe that thallium 201 scanning should be advised for severe systemic connective tissue diseases with discordant test results.\r"

Peripheral joint complaints without radiographically detectable erosions, but with periarticular new bone formation, occurred in three patients.

  ".W": "The responses to aggressive gluten challenge of two dermatitis herpetiformis patients with normal gut mucosa and negative serum findings for IgA endomysial antibodies while on normal diets indicate that these patients have a latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This was shown further by the control of skin lesions in both cases and in one case by the clearance of the induced gut lesions with a gluten-free diet. Specifically, for 12 to 20 weeks, aggressive gluten challenge (1 to 2 gm/kg/day) of these two patients was followed by both the appearance of and a rise in titer of IgA endomysial antibodies with an exacerbation of skin lesions. After 27 weeks of gluten challenge, histologic studies of the gut showed grade III flattening of the jejunal mucosa in the patient who developed IgA endomysial antibodies 19 weeks before biopsy was performed but not in the patient in whom IgA endomysial antibodies appeared 7 weeks before biopsy was performed. When both patients were placed on a gluten-free diet, IgA endomysial antibodies titers showed negative findings and the skin lesions subsided. It was possible to discontinue dapsone treatment after 30 weeks on a gluten-free diet in one patient and after 33 weeks in the other. It is important to note in the patient who developed grade III (significant) gut pathology after gluten challenge that a third biopsy taken 59 weeks after starting a gluten-free diet revealed a return to a grade II (insignificant) level of villus atrophy. Thus if sulfones are contraindicated in such cases, patients can be treated successfully with a gluten-free diet.\r"

We studied mole counts in relation to the attitude toward ultraviolet exposure in 508 students 18 to 30 years of age. Moles were counted on the chest, back, and legs. Lesions measuring 2 mm or less in diameter and those measuring more than 2 mm were recorded separately. Dysplastic nevi were also recorded separately. The attitude toward sun worship was related to the average periods of sunbathing, the frequency of holidays in sunny climates, and the use of artificial ultraviolet sources. The frequency of pigmented nevi showed no correlation with sun behavior, irrespective of sex, mole size, or burning and tanning propensities. This lack of correlation between ultraviolet exposure and mole counts held true for all solar parameters: periods of sunbathing, sunny holidays, and sunlamp usage. Contrary to expectation, there was a clear, although not statistically significant, excess of dysplastic nevi in subjects with short periods of ultraviolet exposure during leisure. From these data insufficient evidence emerges to support the hypothesis of a correlation between the occurrence of common nevocytic nevi and dysplastic nevi and the degree of insolation by natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation.\r"

Fourteen of 38 affected members of the family were examined clinically; their ages ranged from 2 to 35. The main clinical features were bullae, generalized, solitary, and in groups, with predilection to the skin of the palms and soles. Mild to moderate patchy hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles was found in 5 affected members of the family; their ages ranged from 2 to 7; 9 other affected adults were free. Blisters in oral mucous membranes were noted and found in summer and in periods of fever; hair, teeth, and nails were normal. Age of onset of the disease was from birth to 2 weeks. Expressivity appeared equally variable within and between sibships. Improvement was noted by progression of age from 5 to 23 years, and by some in summer and by others in winter. In contrast to previous reports, aggravation of the disease was noted during fever periods. Ultrastructural studies from a fresh blister disclosed intraepidermal blister via cytolysis of basal cell cytoplasm. The pedigree shows the transmission of an autosomal dominant gene. Affection of both consanguineous parents and their six offspring with epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis Dowling-Meara is the most striking feature of the family--probably 25% of their offspring were homozygote.\r"

Patient demand for correction of soft tissue contour irregularities is high and continues to increase daily. The use of injectable collagen with appropriate technique can provide these patients with significant improvement without great cost or significant side effects. In the year following the introduction of glutaraldehyde cross-linked Zyplast Implant, 188 patients were evaluated for soft tissue augmentation with bovine collagen in my clinical practice. Diagnoses varied from facial elastosis to scars due to acne, pox, trauma, and cancer. Some patients desired changes in facial contour (thicker lips; postrhinoplasty defect). Patient satisfaction was high (83% good or excellent results) and side effects were minimal. In our study we found that 3% of patients demonstrated hypersensitivity to the test implant. Treatment with non-cross-linked Zyderm and Zyplast collagens in the patients with a negative skin test resulted in six hypersensitivity reactions (3%). In these patients reactions were not observed at sites treated only with cross-linked collagen and clinical responses appeared to be directed at the non-cross-linked collagen implant sites. With proper treatment technique and patient consultation, the results obtained with injectable collagen fulfill expectations of treated patients.\r"

The examinations using a monochromator revealed that the augmentation spectrum ranged from 450 to 500 nm. Postirradiation of the spectrum had no effect. The inhibition spectrum was also determined in longer wavelengths ranging from 550 to 600 nm. Both postirradiation and preirradiation of the inhibition spectrum exerted their effects. The augmentation spectrum revealed no effects on the wheal formation induced by histamine or compound 48/80 in the patient.

No dog received antigen, agonist, or therapeutic aerosols for 4 weeks before BAL. The fluid recovered was centrifuged, and the number of mast cells was quantitated. Aliquots containing equal numbers of mast cells were incubated with A 23187 or C5 for 30 minutes, and histamine release was measured by an automated fluorometric method. Spontaneous release, A 23187-induced release, C5-induced release, and total histamine content per mast cell were calculated. The total amount of histamine per mast cell was not significantly different in BGs and allergic and nonallergic control dogs. Mast cells obtained by BAL released histamine to A 23187 and C5 in a dose-related manner. Spontaneous histamine release and A 23187-induced histamine release was significantly greater in BGs and allergic control dogs compared to nonallergic control dogs. C5-induced histamine release was significantly greater in BGs than in allergic as well as nonallergic control dogs. These data suggest that BAL mast cell histamine releasability must be defined with respect to each stimulus and that mast cells obtained from BAL from control dogs differ with respect to histamine releasability from mast cells of allergic dogs with and without airway hyperresponsiveness. This study suggests that mast cells obtained from BAL can be used to study mast cell function in the control and the allergic state.\r"

The DTH response decreased with increasing age and with increasing dependency in a nursing home. Thus, 1.5%, 9.5%, 17.9%, 41.8%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, of the subjects in the groups listed above were anergic. For the healthy subjects, age and sex were significant factors in predicting a positive response to the skin test antigens. Use of a logistic model revealed that for male subjects, the probability of a positive response was Ln (p/1 - p) = 1.72 - 0.038 (age), whereas for female subjects, it was Ln (p/1 - p) 0.59 - 0.0213 (age). When this model was applied to the responses of senior citizens, those living at home had a significantly greater response than did those in nursing homes. Furthermore, those self-sufficient while they were living in a nursing home had a significantly greater response than those who were not self-sufficient.\r"

In this article, we demonstrate IgE-mediated sensitivity to Trichophyton in a patient with chronic dermatophytosis secondary to Cushing's syndrome. Cell-mediated immunity was absent, but Trichophyton extract produced an immediate skin response and also stimulated a concentration-dependent histamine release from basophils of the patient. After adrenalectomy, cell-mediated immunity to Trichophyton was restored, and infection was confined to the nails. Skin and leukocyte sensitivity to Trichophyton extract persisted and was even more pronounced than the sensitivity before adrenalectomy. RAST measurement confirmed the presence of Trichophyton-specific IgE after adrenalectomy. These results provide further evidence that IgE-mediated inflammatory events may be initiated by Trichophyton infection.\r"

Histamine increased mean SRL by 213%. Intravenous (20 micrograms/kg) and aerosolized (5 mg) gallopamil markedly inhibited the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Mean SRL increased by 19% and 23%, respectively, whereas 2.5 mg of aerosolized gallopamil partly inhibited the histamine-induced response with SRL increasing by 115% (p less than 0.05). Carbachol increased mean SRL by 380%. Pretreatment with 2.5 mg of aerosolized gallopamil had no effect on carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction, whereas intravenous and 5 mg of aerosolized gallopamil partly attenuated the carbachol response; mean SRL increased by 204% and 177%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Intravenous (150 micrograms/kg) and aerosolized (10 mg and 20 mg) verapamil did not prevent either histamine- or carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction. These results indicate that gallopamil (parenteral and aerosol) attenuates carbachol- and histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, is more potent than verapamil, and may be of therapeutic potential.\r"

The concentrations of IgE antibodies to P1 and Dp X in sera of mite-sensitive patients were determined in RAST with immunosorbent-bound monoclonal antibodies used for insolubilization of the allergens. The major allergen-specific IgE titers were compared with the total IgE response against D. pteronyssinus. The results of these serologic assays confirmed studies in the literature that P1 and Dp X are major allergens. The contribution of IgE anti-P1 to the total antimite response frequently exceeded 50% and, in general, appeared to be higher than the contribution of IgE anti-Dp X. Twenty percent of the mite-sensitive patients had no detectable IgE to either P1 or Dp X. The contribution of P1 to the biologic activity of D. pteronyssinus body extracts was derived from the effect of P1 depletion on the reactivity in the histamine-release test and skin test. This technique was preferred to the study of purified allergen because biologic activity of the nonabsorbed components is not affected. Immunization of rabbits with affinity-purified P1 yielded monospecific polyclonal antisera. Mite extracts depleted with either monoclonal or polyclonal anti-P1 were applied in the histamine-release test. The skin test was performed with extracts depleted with polyclonal anti-P1. In addition, the activity of affinity-purified P1 was investigated in these tests. The results indicated that P1 depletion of D. pteronyssinus body extracts had no detectable effect on the activity in most patients, namely, at least 70% of the activity was retained in the depleted extract. There was a considerable variation between patients in the sensitivity for purified P1, as compared to the sensitivity for whole D. pteronyssinus extracts. In the histamine-release test, the activity of purified P1 was up to 35% of the activity of the D. pteronyssinus body extract but did not exceed 10% in most patients. This was in agreement with the relative activity of purified P1, as found in the skin test. Therefore, the contribution of P1 to the biologic activity of D. pteronyssinus body extracts, as measured by end point titration, appeared to be less than expected on the basis of the serologic studies and articles in literature. The depletion experiments stress that there is still much uncertainty as to the biologic activity of house dust-mite extracts.\r"

Successful reversal of anaphylaxis requires prompt recognition of symptoms and early institution of therapy. Patients prone to exercise-induced anaphylaxis should avoid any foods, drinks, or pharmaceutical agents, particularly acetylsalicylic acid, for 4, and preferably 6, hours before exercise.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis, we developed a nasal challenge model in which we examined the early, late, and rechallenge responses to antigen provocation. In these three aspects of the allergic reaction the physiologic responses are associated with inflammatory mediator release. Whereas the early response appears to be related mainly to mast cell activation and mediator release, the late reaction involves a different pattern of mediator release and an inflammatory cell influx, consisting of basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Rechallenge with antigen 11 hours later results in an augmented immediate response. Pretreatment with aspirin reduces the levels of cyclooxygenase metabolites in nasal secretions without affecting the immediate physiologic response to antigen or the expected increase in the levels of histamine, N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase activity, and leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with systemic steroids does not affect the early allergic response, but significantly reduces mediator release during the late and rechallenge responses. The influx of eosinophils is inhibited by pretreatment with systemic steroids, but neutrophil influx is not. In contrast, pretreatment with topical steroids blocks the early response and the late and rechallenge responses. Influx of all cell types, including the neutrophil, was prevented. These studies show unequivocally that an inflammatory process follows the initial response to antigen and that this inflammation is affected by drugs important in the treatment of chronic allergic disease. We speculate that understanding allergic inflammation will lead to new therapeutic development.\r"

Immediate mediator release is reduced both in basophils challenged in vitro and in nasal secretions after local challenge in vivo. Effects on late-phase inflammatory reactions are still under investigation. Standardization of allergenic extracts by immunologic methods should make useful therapeutic responses more frequent.\r"

The six health professions were nutrition support dietitians, general clinical dietitians, directors of nursing, hospital administrators, chief dietitians, and physicians. Respondents were selected from relatively large hospitals (greater than 200 beds) that were distributed geographically across the United States. Results indicated that nutrition support dietitians had a more positive view of how their profession was viewed by others than did general clinical dietitians. A larger proportion of nutrition support dietitians than of general clinical dietitians believed that they were viewed as working with specialized patients (14% vs. 9%), as an important part of the hospital team (20% vs. 6%), and as acting as a resource person for the medical staff (30% vs. 13%). Physicians and chief dietitians held the strongest opinions concerning the image of the nutrition support and general clinical dietitians; both held a more positive view of the nutrition support dietitian. A greater number of physicians expressed the view that nutrition support dietitians were more competent and knowledgeable than were general clinical dietitians (24% vs. 9%) and were an important part of the hospital team (36% vs. 15%). A greater percentage of chief dietitians said that nutrition support dietitians, in comparison with general clinical dietitians, were competent and knowledgeable (40% vs. 19%) and professional, well respected, expert, and more specialized (65% vs. 44%). In comparison with 5 years ago, 76% and 69% of nutrition support and general clinical dietitians, respectively, thought that they are now viewed as more professional and as having abilities that are recognized.\r"

Anticipated staffing needs and desired job functions were also assessed. For the nutrition support and general clinical dietitians, as viewed by themselves and other health professionals, there was considerable overlap in many job activities. However, a significantly larger proportion of directors of nursing thought that nutrition support dietitians were more involved than general clinical dietitians in the evaluation of nutritional status (42% vs. 14%) and in contributing expertise to medical team discussions (48% vs. 12%). A significantly larger proportion of physicians viewed the nutrition support dietitian as more involved than the general clinical dietitian in in-service programs for medical and nursing staffs (32% vs. 6%). A large proportion of directors of nursing (62%), hospital administrators (34%), and physicians (56%) believed that dietetic involvement in the supervision of food preparation, especially by general clinical dietitians, was much greater than did the dietetic staff. The outlook for the future suggests a greater participation by both the nutrition support and the general clinical dietitian in direct patient care functions and less involvement in food preparation and clerical tasks.\r"

Milk lipid, total nitrogen, and energy content differed significantly from one woman to another.

In this study, 11 subjects were evaluated independently by three experienced applied kinesiologists for four nutrients (thiamin, zinc, vitamin A, and ascorbic acid). The results obtained by those applied kinesiologists were compared with (a) one another, (b) standard laboratory tests for nutrient status, and (c) computerized isometric muscle testing. Statistical analysis yielded no significant interjudge reliability, no significant correlation between the testers and standard biochemical tests for nutrient status, and no significant correlation between mechanical and manual determinations of relative muscle strength. In addition, the subjects were exposed in a double-blind fashion to supplements of thiamin, zinc, vitamin A, and ascorbic acid and two placebos (pectin and sucrose) and then re-tested. According to applied kinesiology theory, \"weak\" (indicating deficiency) muscles are strengthened when the subject is exposed to an appropriate nutritional supplement. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the response to placebo, nutrients previously determined (by muscle testing) to be deficient, and nutrients previously determined (by muscle testing) to be adequate. Even though the number of subjects (11) and nutrients (4) tested was limited, the results of this study indicated that the use of applied kinesiology to evaluate nutrient status is no more useful than random guessing.\r"

This article reviews some of the current literature on mentoring and presents concepts that may benefit persons in the profession of dietetics. The process of mentoring provides mentors with career and psychosocial rewards, while proteges benefit from a wide variety of career and/or social opportunities made available through the relationship. Rewards for each member of the dyad appear dependent on the age and needs of each person. An alternative to mentoring, known as the patron system, has been proposed; that system places mentoring at the end point of a continuum which includes peer pals, guides, and sponsors. Networking, a crucial aspect of career development, broadens opportunities for prospective mentors or sponsors and proteges to meet and interact. Entry-level dietitians can benefit from mentor-protege relationships which groom young professionals for leadership positions. The question to be answered is how such relationships can be supported in our various work settings. A model of the mentoring process in dietetics is proposed.\r"

A study of 98 adult patients with diabetes was conducted to investigate some of the variables affecting compliance in that patient population. Compliance and knowledge scores were computed for all 98 patients interviewed. Twelve patients at each extreme of the compliance distribution (no. = 24) were selected for further interviews. Nonparametric analyses were used to test for group differences. Significant differences were found in the mean values for the following variables (mean +/- standard error of the mean for low and high compliers): years diabetic, 5.7 +/- 1.5 and 12.1 +/- 2.4, respectively (p = .05); knowledge scores, 12.2 +/- 1.4 and 20.9 +/- 2.6, respectively (p = .001); and Health Belief Model score, 35.5 +/- 2.6 and 47.2 +/- 1.2, respectively (p = .002). In addition, significant differences were found in the use of home glucose monitoring, which was practiced by 33% of low compliers and 100% of high compliers (p = .002). No significant differences were found between the groups for sex, marital status, employment status, or ethnicity. The patients' perception of health care delivery and the knowledge acquired about the disease condition appeared to be important factors that had a bearing upon the control the patients chose to exert upon their care. There also appears to be some indication that the Health Belief Model can be used for predicting compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Various nutritional parameters including weight loss, percentage average body weight, serum albumin levels, anthropometrics, and skin testing were examined in 130 patients in an academic nursing home, two thirds of whom were over the age of 65 years. Functional status including type of feeding and associated diseases was also determined. The data show that nutritional risk factors are similar among different age-groups in nursing home patients. A significant proportion of our patients lost weight while maintaining their serum albumin levels. Despite this, there appears to be less evidence of malnutrition among patients in the academic nursing home compared with other nursing home settings studied.\r"

A total of 86 street-dwelling and 195 non-street-dwelling (177 flophouse-, 18 apartment-dwelling) men aged 50 and older on the Bowery in New York City were studied. Although 23% evidenced psychosis or had prior psychiatric hospitalization (PPH group), depression was more prevalent with one third of all men categorized as clinically depressed. Only 5% evidenced gross organic mental disease. Several groups were identified for intervention because of their increased susceptibility to depression: alcoholics, relatively younger men, those with organic mental symptoms, street men. With respect to the PPH men, they did not appear to be distinct from the other homeless men on various social and health indices, although they differed substantially from age-matched community men. Thus these men must be viewed as homeless first, and in addition, as having the handicap of mental illness. Contrary to the popular stereotype, there was no evidence of widespread isolation among the PPH men, and despite their disturbances, most showed an adequate capacity for survival.\r"

The relationship between the incidence and severity of SA and PLMs and sleep complaints has not, however, been determined in terms of symptomatology and physiologic abnormality. In a group of 46 community resident seniors (60 to 95 years old), the incidence of SA and PLMs was correlated with subjective sleep-wake complaints. Sixty-one percent of subjects had SA and/or PLMs. Apneas/hypopneas were associated with an average oxygen desaturation of less than 5% and an average change in heart rate of less than 10 beats per minute. While subjects with SA or PLMs had clear evidence of objective sleep disturbance, only one quarter of them admitted to any subjective sleep complaints or daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, severity of SA or PLMs failed to predict sleep-wake complaints, and vice versa. This study confirms that typically mild SA and PLMs are widespread in the elderly but tend not to be manifested in sleep-wake complaints and probably go untreated as a result. Further research is needed to determine any long-term medical significance.\r"

The prediction formula is presented, along with a prediction table. Folstein and McHugh report that, as the WAIS Performance IQ falls below 100 in demented patients, that there is a concomitant decline in the MMSE below 24 points. Data from our laboratory further support what some clinicians have long suggested, ie, that in those cases where only the mental status examination can be given, this short test can provide a reasonably valid and reliable prediction of the patient's IQ score.\r"

There was a slight increase in the degree of sexual dysfunction with age, with complete erectile failure occurring in a larger percent of the 60- and 70-year-olds than in the younger patients (41% vs 27% for the 40 year olds, P less than .05). No patient above the age of 70 years reported any full erections, even of short duration. In contrast, reported levels of libido did not vary significantly with age. Abnormal penile Doppler studies diagnostic of vasculogenic impotence were found in 17.8% of the patients tested, and an additional 17.8% were found to have evidence suggestive of a vascular etiology. These abnormal vascular findings were associated with an extremely high prevalence of clinically apparent atherosclerosis in this population. In 22.9% of the subjects, an abnormal vascular response was found only on exercise, ie, a \"pelvic steal\", which only occurred above the age of 50 years. There was a marked age-related alteration in the concentration of testosterone (T) and bioavailable testosterone (BT), but no statistically significant change in the levels of gonadotropins with age. An increase in the prevalence of eugonadotropic hypogonadism with age was found, which suggested an increasing prevalence of hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction in this patient group. For both vascular and hormonal changes (such as low T and BT), the greatest changes appear to occur after the age of 50.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared their survey responses with responses from a general medical clinic for unstable medical patients, aged under 65 (\"old-young\"). Of 347 subjects surveyed, 225 completed a health and sexual function questionnaire (response rate = 65%). Absent libido was reported by 30% of old-young, 31% of young-old, and 47% of old-old. Erectile dysfunction was reported in 26% of old-young, 27% of young-old, and 50% of old-old (P less than .01). We used ordinal logistic regression and found overall sexual dysfunction to be significantly related to subjective poor health, diabetes mellitus, and incontinence (P less than .05), while controlling for age. These data suggest that, although sexual dysfunction is more common in the aged, it is often related more to comorbid illness than aging alone.\r"

The consequences of ACS were prolonged ward-stay at the orthopedic department, a greater need for long-term care after discharge, and poor walking ability at discharge and six months after surgery. The confused patients also had more complications, such as urinary problems, feeding problems and decubital ulcers, as compared with the nonconfused patients.\r"

In two patients, transient vocal cord paresis was observed, and seven patients (18%) experienced immediate postoperative hypertension. Our results support the contention that in awake elderly patients the need for an intraoperative shunt can be accurately assessed by simple neurological monitoring.

In order to study the role of active suppression in regulating mouse RBC-(MRBC) specific cells in nonautoimmune cell populations, the effect of depleting T cell subsets on the generation of anti-MRBC autoantibodies by nonautoimmune spleen cells was determined. Spleen cells from young BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were found to generate significant numbers of IgM and IgG anti-MRBC autoantibody-forming cells in culture with MRBC after depletion of Ly-2+ cells by anti-Ly-2 and C treatment. The response which develops is Ag dependent, Ag specific, and dependent upon L3T4+ Th. The magnitude and isotype of this response is similar to the anti-MRBC response generated by spleen cells from 12-mo-old, autoimmune NZB mice and young NZB mice also treated to remove Ly-2+ cells. Addition of isolated Ly-2+ T cells, but not L3T4+ or Ly-2- T cells, to spleen cells depleted of Ly-2+ cells restores apparently normal regulation of the anti-MRBC response in vitro. These data demonstrate that control of a specific autoantibody response to MRBC by nonautoimmune spleen cell populations requires active regulation by an Ly-2+ T cell subset.\r"

With a solid phase enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, PBMC from immunized individuals were assayed for spontaneous Ag-specific antibody (Ab) production before, and on days 7, 14, and 28 after vaccination. On the day of immunization, no spontaneous Ag-specific Ab-secreting cells could be detected. On day 7 after vaccination, a high frequency of cells secreting Ab specific for pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS) was observed. The IgA class comprised 79% (geometric mean) of the Ag-specific Ab-secreting cells, whereas IgG- and IgM-secreting cells accounted for 12% and 9%, respectively. The majority of Ag-specific IgA-secreting cells produced Ab of the IgA2 isotype. Serum, saliva, and tears collected before and on days 7, 14, and 28 after vaccination were assayed for specific Ab to the vaccine (anti-PPS Ab) by an ELISA. Serum IgA anti-PPS Ab showed the highest increase after vaccination with a 19-fold increase (geometric mean) which peaked on day 14. However, the ratio of Ag-specific polymeric vs monomeric IgA did not change after immunization. Serum IgG and IgM anti-PPS Ab displayed mean increases of 5.5-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively, on day 14. The most pronounced increase of salivary anti-PPS Ab was observed in the IgG class (4.5-fold on day 28) followed by IgM (4-fold on day 28), IgA (2.0-fold on day 14), IgA1 (2.4-fold on day 14) and IgA2 (2.0-fold on day 14). The levels of total IgA, IgG, and IgM in saliva did not change significantly throughout the course of immunization. IgG and IgM anti-PPS Ab levels in tears increased less than in saliva, whereas IgA behaved similarly as in saliva. There were no significant differences in the Ag-specific increase rates between the IgA, IgG, and IgM isotypes in tears.\r"

Of these antibodies 30% expressed the B5 Id determinant. As was observed for the IdX-Id, B5 idiotope expression was also linked to the BALB/c H chain allotype. The antibody family expressing the B5 Id included IdX+ as well as IdX- defined monoclonal anti-alpha (1-3) DEX antibodies. Injection into BALB/c mice of mAb B5 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin led to enhancement of serum anti-alpha (1-3) DEX antibody synthesis, and to a strong increase in B5+ Ig lacking dextran-binding activity. IdX+ serum Ig were also increased in these mice. Injection of this mAb into allotype congenic nonresponder C.B20 mice induced a significant serum lambda 1-bearing anti-alpha (1-3) dextran antibody response (5 to 50 micrograms/ml). However, in A/J nonresponder mice, a similar treatment induced only the dextran-nonbinding component, which reached high levels (approximately 7 mg/ml) in the sera of these mice. In the majority of these A/J mice, we detected a specific anti-(4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl antibody response characterized by B5 Id-positive antibodies. This observation can be explained by an in vivo regulatory idiotope-mediated cross-regulation.\r"

Studies were done to investigate the potential inheritance of the idiotype in families; in three of four families the idiotype was inherited in an apparent autosomal dominant pattern. Our data show that a common cross-reactive idiotype can be detected in the sera of IgA-deficient individuals and their family members. This suggests that V region markers may be conserved in this humoral immunodeficiency disease.\r"

A portion of high affinity LTB4-R on PMN leukocyte membranes were converted to the low affinity state by GTP (mean +/- SE = 28.6 +/- 14.0%) and nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, such as 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP), in a concentration-dependent, nucleotide-specific, and reversible manner, without altering the intrinsic binding affinities of either class. [3H]GMP-PNP bound specifically to one class of receptors (mean Kd = 13 nM) on PMN leukocyte membranes. The interdependence of the LTB4-binding membrane protein and guanine nucleotide-binding protein was suggested by the capacity of LTB4 to enhance by a maximum of 150% the binding of [3H]GMP-PNP to PMN leukocyte membranes by increasing the number, but not altering the affinity, of receptors for GMP-PNP. Pertussis toxin, but not cholera toxin, reversed the enhancement of binding of [3H]GMP-PNP produced by LTB4. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and high affinity LTB4-R thus exhibit a mutual regulation that differs mechanistically from that of peptide chemotactic factor receptors on PMN leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation (ES) of sensory nerves causes increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation, a process known as neurogenic inflammation. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of mast cells in neurogenic inflammation induced by ES of sensory nerves. ES of the rat saphenous nerve for 1, 3, 5, 15, or 30 min induced a 166 to 436% increase in the amount of 125I-albumin deposited in the skin. Through the initial 15 min of ES, the histamine content of the skin remained unchanged. However, 30 min of ES caused a 22.1% decrease in skin histamine (p less than 0.05). ES for 5 min followed by measurement of vascular permeability from 0 to 30 min thereafter resulted in maximal increases in 125I-albumin in the skin immediately after cessation of the pulse of ES. When skin histamine was measured at various intervals after a 5-min pulse of ES, no change in the histamine content was observed through the subsequent 30 min. When mast cell degranulation was assessed histologically, 5 min of ES failed to stimulate mast cell degranulation. However, 30 min of ES caused a significant increase in the proportion of degranulating mast cells. When draining venous plasma histamine was monitored before, during and after ES, no change in plasma histamine was observed. In contrast, the intradermal injection of 5 micrograms of compound 48/80 produced a significant increase in plasma histamine. In order to examine the possibility that histamine might be released but remain in the skin after ES, skin \"blisters\" were developed by intradermal injections of saline. There was a significant increase in the amount of 125I-albumin extravasated into blister fluid measured after 3, 5, and 10 min of ES and a significant increase in histamine after 5 or 10 min. Therefore, prolonged ES of sensory nerves can cause mast cell degranulation. However, ES causes increased vascular permeability at times when no mast cell activation can be observed. These data suggest that the initial phases of neurogenic inflammation are independent of mast cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells depended on the rate and extent of the aggregation of receptors of IgE. This response was used as an experimental probe to study the role of IgE receptors in initiating stimulatory and inhibitory processes within the cell. The response was amplified markedly by increasing the concentration of external Ca2+ from 0 to 1 mM, but the concentration required to support half-maximal response varied from less than 0.1 mM for the most potent cross-linking reagent, DNP24BSA (24 molecules of DNP attached to 1 molecule of BSA) to 0.5 mM for the least potent reagent, aggregated OVA. The dependency of phosphoinositide hydrolysis on external Ca2+ was reduced to zero once hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was underway but secretion of histamine remained totally dependent on the presence of 0.5 to 1 mM external Ca2+. The stimulatory response persisted as long as receptors remained aggregated but it was modulated by a biochemical process, possibly the activation of protein kinase C, that targeted specifically aggregated receptors, or an associated protein. For example, when cells had become desensitized to high concentrations of one Ag, a normal response could be evoked with a second Ag. Also cells that had become desensitized could be reactivated by permeabilizing the cells. Interestingly, bell-shaped Ag dose-response curves, which were characteristic for both the phosphoinositide and secretory responses, were transformed to sigmoid-shaped curves once cells were permeabilized and dialyzed.\r"

  ".W": "The anti-neutrophil mAb PMN 7C3 and IIC4 inhibited the respiratory burst of neutrophils as measured by the generation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide in response to PMA, serum-treated zymosan, and FMLP. To examine the effect of these mAb on neutrophil transmembrane potential, a fluorescent probe was used in a continuous assay. Compared with control cells, antibody-treated neutrophils were partially depolarized at rest and had a blunted response when stimulated. The F(ab)2 fragment of PMN 7C3 had similar effects on both the respiratory burst and transmembrane potential, whereas the Fab fragment did not. The unrelated antineutrophil mAb 31D8 had no effect on either the respiratory burst or on transmembrane potential. Neutrophils suspended in high potassium buffers also exhibited partial depolarization of the resting cell membrane and a blunted depolarization response to stimuli and produced less superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in response to stimuli than did control cells in physiologic buffer. Exposure of neutrophils to 2-deoxy-D-glucose resulted in dose- and time-dependent depression of the respiratory burst. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose also caused depolarization of the resting membrane and impaired subsequent stimulus-induced depolarization. Similar effects were seen with addition of iodoacetamide or depletion of glucose. The parallel effects of anti-neutrophil mAb, depolarizing buffers, and glycolytic inhibitors on both neutrophil membrane depolarization and activation of the respiratory burst indicate a close association between these two events. The evidence suggests that the inhibitory effects of these antibodies are mediated through partial membrane depolarization which interferes with signal transduction on subsequent stimulation of the cells. The impairment in oxidative responses to phorbol esters as well as to receptor-dependent activating agents points to interruption at a distal step, e.g., subsequent to Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

  ".W": "An HLA class II-positive melanoma cell line, DU-Mel 17, was treated with three compounds known to induce differentiation in various cell lines. Neither retinoic acid nor dibutyryl cAMP altered levels of DR alpha mRNA, but 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) significantly decreased the level of DR alpha mRNA 48 h after treatment. Optimal effect of the hormone on DR alpha mRNA was reached by 72 h. DU-Mel 17 cells were responsive to 1,25(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent manner, and a reduction in DR alpha mRNA was seen at concentrations as low as 5 x 10(-13) M. The action of 1,25(OH)2D3 on DR alpha mRNA levels was dependent on protein synthesis as evidenced by inhibition of its effect upon addition of cycloheximide. Both DR and DQ protein levels on the surface of DU-Mel 17 were beginning to decline by 72 h after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, and by 96 h these proteins were decreased by 65%. 1,25(OH)2D3 was not capable of altering expression of class II molecules on three different class II-positive B lymphoblastoid cell lines, although one of these lines was shown to express the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3. These findings are important because 1) there is no known physiologic regulator that actively down-regulates class II molecules that are present in and/or on cells, 2) levels of mRNA derived from a very limited number of genes are known to be altered by 1,25(OH)2D3, and 3) they support the contention that 1,25(OH)2D3 may alter the differentiation state of these cells and the activity of the normal counterpart of these cells in an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Mixed lymphocyte typing provides an exquisitely sensitive means of detecting the polymorphism of HLA class II molecules. By using this technique, the differences between divergent human populations become apparent. This study describes a DR1 haplotype commonly present in the American black population. Unlike the Northern European population in which almost all DR1 individuals are DQw1 and type as Dw1 by using mixed lymphocyte typing, approximately 50% of DR1, DQw1 positive American blacks express an undefined Dw specificity. The DR beta polypeptide encoded by a DR1,Dw-cell differs from a previously described DR1,Dw1 beta sequence by two amino acid replacements at positions 85 and 86 in the first domain. One silent nucleotide substitution has also been identified. DQ alpha and beta first domain cDNA sequences from this haplotype are identical with previously described DQ sequences from a DR1,Dw1 cell. This relatively minor change in amino acid sequence of the DR molecule appears to produce the undefined HLA-D specificity in this haplotype. The variant DR1 sequence is shared with a DR beta-chain from the DR2,DwMN2 haplotype suggesting that a gene conversion-like mechanism has generated this difference.\r"

This has led to the hypothesis that p15E expression allows nascent tumor cells to escape host immunologic defenses. To evaluate the role of p15E expression in tumorigenesis, NIH3T3 cells transformed by various oncogenes and BALB/c lines transformed by carcinogens or SV40 were examined for p15E expression and tumorigenicity. All of the NIH3T3 transformants and most of the BALB/c transformants did not express p15E, indicating that transformation per se does not inevitably induce the expression of p15E. Although not expressing p15E, some of these transformants were capable of forming tumors in immune competent hosts, indicating that p15E is not universally required for tumor growth. Four of the transformed cell lines negative for p15E expression and deficient in tumor-forming capacity were transfected with a gene coding for Moloney retroviral p15E. Despite the expression of p15E, there was no augmentation of their tumorigenic capacity, showing that p15E is not sufficient to ensure tumor formation by a transformed cell. These results argue against a general role for retroviral p15E expression in tumorigenesis.\r"

Mice received syngeneic FSA-1 fibrosarcoma cells either s.c. or i.v. in order to evaluate growth of transplantable solid tumor or lung metastases, respectively. The range of dosages, from 10(2) to 2 x 10(5) U of rTNF, was administered i.v. at different intervals after the tumor cell injection. Early injection of 10(3) to 10(4) U of rTNF reduced the growth of s.c. injected tumor and the number of lung metastases in i.v. injected mice. In both cases, survival of mice was also prolonged. However, in vitro treatment of FSA-1 tumor cells with rTNF did not result in the reduction of their proliferating activity after injection into mice, although direct cytostatic and moderate cytotoxic activity of rTNF in vitro was demonstrated. To identify whether other cellular mechanisms are involved in the effects observed in vivo, the anti-tumor activity of rTNF-treated spleen cells was evaluated in vitro using a 75Se release assay. Whereas nontreated spleen cells demonstrated very low cytotoxic activity in this system, the cells from rTNF-treated mice showed marked increase in the cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor cells. These results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of rTNF represents a combination of its direct effect on tumor cells and indirect effects involving host immune mechanisms.\r"

Anti-idiotypic mAb (Ab2) was developed against one of the antibodies (Ab1) reactive with species-specific epitopes. Thus Ab2 was demonstrated to recognize an idiotope expressed on the Ag-binding site (paratope) of Ab1, since the binding of Ab1 to human type II collagen was blocked by Ab2, and the binding of Ab2 to Ab1 was inhibited by soluble human type II collagen, but not by murine and bovine type II collagens. DBA/1 mice immunized with Ab2 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin produced an antibody (Ab3) specifically reactive with human type II collagen. It was also demonstrated that Ab3 expressed an idiotype similar to that of Ab1. These findings indicate that anti-idiotypic antibody directed against mAb to human type II collagen mimics a species-specific epitope on human type II collagen. The anti-idiotypic antibody bearing internal image of type II collagen will open the way to isolation of the arthritogenic epitope on type II collagen.\r"

These animals developed glomerulonephritis, forefoot edema, alopecia, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy to various degrees, and all developed antinuclear antibodies. To determine whether these antibodies were directed against the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles that are characteristic targets for autoimmune responses in human rheumatic diseases, sera were studied in the 32P immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. Among 20 mice, antibodies to snRNP developed in 10. These antibodies usually reached maximal levels about 4 wk after induction of graft vs host disease and generally fell thereafter. However, two mice developed antibodies to snRNP between the 10th and 20th wk of follow-up. Sera from six mice strongly recognized the U1 snRNP and an additional serum strongly bound both the U1 and U3 particles. Several sera contained lower levels of antibodies specific for the U3 and possibly pre-U2 snRNP particles. In immunoblots, sera that immunoprecipitated the U1 snRNP bound epitopes located on its 70,000 Da, A, B'/B, and/or C polypeptides. Sera that immunoprecipitated the U3 snRNP recognized a 34,000-Da polypeptide. These polypeptides are known to bear the autoantigenic epitopes that are recognized by human sera containing anti-U1 RNP and anti-U3 RNP autoantibodies. We conclude that chronic graft vs host disease in mice provides a model for the study of the autoimmune responses that characterize human diseases such as mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, and SLE.\r"

During the course of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity in the presence of actinomycin D, an increase in ADP-ribosylation became apparent between 4 and 6 h after exposure to TNF. Intracellular NAD+ and ATP levels decreased parallel to but not preceding cell death. Two inhibitors of ADP-ribosylation, namely 3-aminobenzamide and nicotinamide, prevented TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Another target, the human cervical carcinoma cell line ME-180, showed an increase in ADP-ribosylation when treated with TNF, and the cytotoxic action of TNF on this target cell was inhibited by these two inhibitors. In the absence of actinomycin D, treatment of L929 cells with TNF also increased ADP-ribosylation, and the cytotoxic action of TNF was inhibited by nicotinamide. These results indicate that ADP-ribosylation may be involved in the TNF-mediated cytotoxic reaction.\r"

Five mAb were members of both group 2 and 3, demonstrating a considerable overlap of epitopes between the corresponding antibody-binding regions. The degree of mAb species specificity, as assessed by inhibition with cold Der p I and Ag Der m I and Der f I from the related species, Dermatophagoides microceras and Dermatophagoides farinae, was highly variable even for mAb binding to the same region on the Ag. Five cases of cross-reactivity between Der p I and Der m I and one case of cross-reactivity between Der p I and Der f I were found. The N-terminal 30 amino acids of the three species showed 7 substitutions between Der p I and Der m I/Der f I and 2 between Der f I and Der p I/Der m I. Single mAb inhibited up to 65% of labeled Der p I binding to immobilized human IgE from allergic patients' sera and up to 24% of labeled Der p I binding to immobilized rabbit antibodies. The spectrum of species specificities in human IgE sera, as assessed by inhibitions with cold Ag, was similar to that of the mAb. No evidence for the presence of strictly sequential epitopes, reactive with either mAb or human IgE was found, as judged from the weak inhibitory activity of acid-denatured Der p I.\r"

Purification of mRNA from PMN and analysis by Northern blots demonstrated the presence in PMN of CR1, actin, and MHC class I transcripts. However, despite the apparent lack of CR3 beta-chain biosynthesis, specific beta-chain message was detectable in PMN RNA. Inhibition of mRNA synthesis in PMN with actinomycin D resulted in decreased synthesis of nascent CR1, FcR, MHC class I, and actin compared with control cells. Thus, PMN continue to transcribe and translate the genes for certain membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. In contrast, the lack of detectable synthesis of either lactoferrin or CR3 beta-chain suggested that biosynthesis in circulating PMN is selective.\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (5-HETE), like leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor, stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils to mobilize intracellular calcium. The three compounds acted through mechanisms that were inhibited by pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and PMA. Each agonist, furthermore, desensitized (or down-regulated) the neutrophil's calcium mobilization response to a second challenge with the same agonist. However, 5-HETE and leukotriene B4 had little or no activity in cross-desensitizing neutrophil responses to each other or to platelet-activating factor. Furthermore, 5-HETE interfered minimally or not at all with the binding of radiolabeled leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor to their respective receptors on neutrophils. Thus, 5-HETE mobilizes neutrophil calcium by a mechanism different from those used by leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor. This mechanism appears to involve specific 5-HETE receptors that couple to pertussis toxin-inhibitable, GTP-binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Human vitiligo is a common depigmenting disorder that is often associated with polyendocrinopathies. The etiology of vitiligo is unknown although there is indirect evidence of a strong association between antimelanocyte antibodies in animal and human vitiligo. We report direct evidence that vitiligo patients' sera containing antimelanocyte antibodies can lyse cultured human melanocytes by both complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Melanocyte cytotoxicity was measured using an ethidium bromide/acridine orange viability assay, after 4 and 16 h incubation with sera from vitiligo patients and from normal controls. Significant melanocyte cytotoxicity was seen with vitiligo patients' sera as an antibody source with both complement-mediated cytotoxicity (p less than 0.01) and ADCC (p less than 0.05) as effector mechanisms. Nine of 11 vitiligo patients' sera produced cytotoxicity by complement-mediated lysis or ADCC. No cytotoxicity was seen using fibroblast targets and vitiligo patients' sera. The lysis of human melanocytes by vitiligo patients' sera by two different effector mechanisms provides direct support for the autoimmune hypothesis of human vitiligo.\r"

Recent studies have demonstrated that CSA also inhibits the proliferation of neoplastic cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. CSA has also been reported to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis, which is characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation. As so many of the therapeutically effective agents in psoriasis are antiproliferative, we sought to determine whether CSA affects the proliferation of keratinocytes. We studied the effect of CSA on the proliferation of normal and transformed keratinocytes and demonstrated that CSA inhibits DNA synthesis and proliferation of keratinocytes. CSA also inhibits DNA synthesis of other neoplastic cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. These findings indicate the CSA inhibits the proliferation of various cell types.\r"

After treatment with saline, fluxes of 5-fluorouracil through the two skin types were similar, but the mouse skin showed exaggerated responses to all the penetration-enhancer formulations. There was no consistent relationship between enchancer effects on the two skin types, and we conclude that the hairless mouse model should not be used to predict the effects of penetration enhancers in human skin. After treatment with saline, hairless mouse skin sharply increased in permeability after approximately 50 h hydration, suggesting that the stratum corneum had started to disrupt, whereas the flux through human skin remained unchanged.\r"

  ".W": "Suberythemogenic exposure of human skin treated with aqueous 8-MOP to radiation greater than 380 nm prolongs photosensitization to subsequent UVA from 6 to 24-72 h. One hypothesis for prolonged photosensitization is that greater than 380 nm irradiation forms 8-MOP-DNA monoadducts, which are removed more slowly than free 8-MOP and serve as a substrate for crosslinking by further UVA exposure. Sufficient DNA crosslinking results in erythema. We have examined this hypothesis by measuring the action spectrum for induction of prolonged photosensitization. Skin of normal volunteers was treated with aqueous 8-MOP (0.003%) and immediately received suberythemogenic monochromatic exposures between 334 and 430 nm. twenty-four hours later, the presence of prolonged sensitization was tested by small exposures of UVA. Erythema was evaluated 3 and 5 d later, and an action spectrum for prolonged sensitization was determined. The minimum phototoxic dose (MPD) was also determined at each wavelength. The action spectrum for prolonged photosensitization declined gradually between 334 and 425 nm. The action spectrum for delayed erythema induced by a single exposure of 8-MOP-treated skin declined rapidly from 334-390 nm. These findings are consistent with prolonged binding of 8-MOP in the skin by an initial exposure, possibly as 8-MOP-DNA monoadducts, allowing the second exposure to induce an erythemogenic event, possibly crosslinking of DNA.\r"

A Simplate-II bleeding-time device was used for producing the wounds, and immunohistochemical techniques were employed for evaluation of the wounds. Antibodies to filaggrin and Ulex europeus I demonstrated little or no staining on migrating epithelium, but staining was apparent whenever epidermal closure had occurred. Bullous pemphigoid antigen was present in the basement membrane zone at all time points examined, including beneath migrating epithelium, whereas antibodies to laminin and type IV collagen were found only at the most lateral aspects of 2-, 3-, and 5-day wounds. Staining progressed centrally by day 7 and was present as a complete linear band beneath most 14-day wounds. The Simplate-II device provides a standard, easy to use, commercially available, sterile, relatively safe method of producing wounds for systematic studies in humans.\r"
