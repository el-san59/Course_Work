  ".U": "91191201\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To find out whether there is any correlation between the use of general health check ups (provided for by the Health Services for the Elderly Act 1982) by insured Japanese residents aged 40 or older and demand by the elderly for inpatient care. DESIGN--A questionnaire was posted in 1988 to municipal offices of Japanese cities. All questionnaires were returned with data for 1983 and 1986. SETTING--All 509 Japanese cities with a population of 30,000-199,999. SUBJECTS--All people aged 40 or older who hold a resident card and are not offered health examinations at work are eligible for general health check ups. The questionnaire also inquired about use of inpatient care by elderly residents (aged 70 or older) who were covered by national health insurance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlation coefficients between the rates of use of general health check ups and mean annual bed days for the elderly. Comparison of relative changes by analysis of correlation between improvement indices in mean bed days and mean inpatient fee. RESULTS--In cities with relatively high rates of use of health check ups both the mean annual bed days and the mean inpatient fee for the elderly tended to be low. Correlation coefficients between the logarithmic rates of use of check ups and mean bed days by sizes of cities and number of beds were all negative values. There tended to be more correlation between improvement indices for rate of use of check ups and both mean bed days and mean inpatient fee with higher rates of use in 1983, and the correlation was significant for rates of 60% or more. CONCLUSIONS--Strong health service programmes that start in middle age decrease the demand for inpatient care of the elderly. It was estimated that in a single year from 1985 to 1986, when there was an increase in the rate of use of check ups from 25.5% to 27.6%, the reduction in the number of bed days for the total of 8.5 million elderly insured people was 2.21 million bed days.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis based on case notes of patients presenting with breast cancer during 1971-89. SETTING--A combined breast clinic. PATIENTS--Consecutive series of 81 women aged less than 36 with histologically proved breast cancer presenting with a discrete mass over 19 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of clinical examination, xeromammography or conventional mammography, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and examination of tissue removed by surgery. RESULTS--The clinical diagnosis was correct in 47 women and radiography in 35. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was correct in 47 of the 63 women in whom it was successfully performed. Fine needle aspiration was significantly more accurate than mammography (78% v 45%, p less than 0.01). Ten (16%) patients had negative results on clinical examination, mammography, and fine needle aspiration. CONCLUSION--Mammography alone seems inadequately sensitive to detect breast cancer in young patients. When all investigations give negative results excision biopsy is the only way of obtaining a definitive diagnosis.\r"

DESIGN--Hospital based follow up study. SETTING--One university hospital and three general hospitals in The Netherlands. PATIENTS--165 patients aged 15 years or more with a clinically presumed idiopathic seizure; diagnosis was based on a description of the episode according to prespecified diagnostic criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of additional investigations and follow up regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis; first recurrence; and response to treatment after the first recurrence. RESULTS--Computed tomography showed major abnormalities in 5.5% of the patients and follow up led to doubts about the initial clinical diagnosis in another 6%. Cumulative risk of recurrence was 40% at two years. The cumulative risk of recurrence at two years was 81% (95% confidence interval 66% to 97%) in patients with epileptic discharges on a standard or partial sleep deprivation electroencephalogram, 39% (27% to 51%) in patients with other electroencephalographic abnormalities, and 12% (3% to 21%) in patients with normal electroencephalograms. Treatment was initiated in most patients who had one or more recurrences; 40 (70%) patients were completely controlled, eight (14%) had sporadic seizures, and nine (16%) did not become free of seizures within one year despite treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The decision to initiate or delay treatment should be based on electroencephalographic findings.\r"

PATIENTS--2830 patients with AIDS reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre and the Communicable Disease (Scotland) Unit up to March 1990, of whom 566 had Kaposi's sarcoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Percentage of patients with AIDS who had Kaposi's sarcoma. RESULTS--537 of 2291 homosexual or bisexual men (23%) with AIDS had Kaposi's sarcoma; 10% (14/135) of the men and women who acquired HIV by heterosexual contact had Kaposi's sarcoma. None of the 316 subjects who acquired HIV through non-sexual routes had Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma was more common among homosexual men whose likely source of infection included the United States (171/551, 31%) or Africa (9/34, 26%) than among those infected in the United Kingdom (119/625, 19%) (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION--The data suggest that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a sexually transmissible agent which was introduced into the British homosexual population mainly from the United States [corrected].\r"

DESIGN--Postal survey of a random sample of general practitioners stratified by rural and urban practice areas, with differential sampling fractions. SETTING--General practices in England and Wales. SUBJECTS--2000 general practitioners, of whom 1459 (74%) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of calls received by general practitioner a day, time reserved for patients' calls, and communication of availability of telephone contact. RESULTS--1421 general practitioners said that they accepted non-emergency calls from patients during the day and 285 reported reserving specific times of the day for this purpose. 848 estimated that they received four or fewer patient calls a day. The number of calls was significantly related to reserving time for calls (p less than 0.001), informing patients that the doctor was accessible by telephone (p less than 0.00001), and the number of periods when calls were accepted (p less than 0.00001). On average there were 3659 patients per incoming line; the number of patients per incoming line rose significantly as practice size increased (p less than 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS--The apparent willingness of general practitioners to accept calls was not reflected in the number of calls received. Reserving time, increasing periods of availability, and publicising telephone access increased the number of doctor-patient telephone contacts. Line congestion may be a problem, and impartial advice and guidance on telephone organisation and line requirements would be helpful.\r"

Five of 19 scleroderma patients had atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (26.3%) while none of the controls and only four of the 88 (4.5%) patients with other connective tissue diseases (P less than 0.01) had this anomaly.

Previous work from this unit has shown a prevalence of tubular dysfunction of 24% in patients with severe rheumatic disease admitted to hospital, probably associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis. Although our study confirms a high prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction, we have shown that it is related to age and intercurrent illness, particularly urinary tract infection, rather than to rheumatic disease or drug therapy, although it is possible drug therapy could add to a compound insult on ageing or damaged kidney.\r"

  ".U": "91191287\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence from several well documented case reports that occasional patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may develop aggravation of their arthritis as a result of allergy to some ingredient in the diet. A variety of foodstuffs have been implicated including milk and milk products, corn and cereals. Total fasting results in improvement in rheumatoid arthritis, but appears to be mediated by diminution in production of chemical mediators of inflammation, rather than by elimination of a dietary allergen. There is conflicting evidence from studies using various intestinal probes that patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have a 'leaky' intestinal mucosa allowing food allergens to be more easily absorbed. Clinical therapeutic trials of exclusion diets have employed the standard strategy of the double-blind randomized method. However, this presupposes that patients entered into such a study are capable of improvement with dietary manipulation. Since this is often not the case, a more appropriate method would be to employ the 'intensive research design' also known as 'single case experiment' and 'N of 1' study. 'Masked food intolerance' is an attractive hypothesis, but extremely difficult to prove. It is doubtful whether fish oils and/or evening primrose oil will be of significant long term benefit for patients with RA. However, they do provide for the possibility that a fatty acid-like substance may be found which may be incorporated into cell membranes, thereby preventing production of mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4.\r"

In the present paper we studied fluctuations of superoxide production (O2), enzyme release (beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme) and neutrophil aggregation in the peripheral blood of eight healthy volunteers and eight patients with RA. Although enzyme release was greater in patients with RA, no significant difference was found throughout the day, neither in control nor in patients. Similar results were obtained when studying neutrophil aggregation. On the contrary, the superoxide production, determined at 8:00, 14:00, and 20:00 h, was 6.3 +/- 0.5, 4.40 +/- 0.4 and 6.26 +/- 0.3, respectively, in patients with RA and 6.65 +/- 0.7, 4.7 +/- 0.7 and 7.27 +/- 0.4 in the controls. The values obtained at 14:00 h were significantly lower (alpha = 0.01). There were no differences in the curve form between patients and controls.\r"

  ".U": "91191307\r", 
  ".W": "Bone mineral content (BMC) of the distal forearm was measured by single photon absorptiometry in 142 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of whom 27/54 men and 44/88 women received low-dose steroid therapy (less than 10 mg/day). To study the effect of steroid therapy a case-control analysis was undertaken in patients matched for age, sex and disease duration. Steroid therapy was associated with a reduced BMC in men (1.16 +/- 0.29 versus 1.32 +/- 0.23; P less than 0.05) and post-menopausal (0.76 +/- 0.24 versus 0.91 +/- 0.25; P less than 0.02) but not pre-menopausal women (1.1 +/- 0.28 versus 1.1 +/- 0.17). Symptomatic fractures were more common in steroid-treated patients than in those who had not received steroids (10/71 versus 2/71; P less than 0.05). Serum osteocalcin, an index of bone formation, was measured in 106 cases. It tended to be higher in patients with RA than in controls but the values observed in steroid and non-steroid RA groups did not differ significantly. We conclude that low-dose steroid therapy is associated with increased bone loss and numbers of fractures in patients with RA but this does not appear to be the result of a simple defect in bone formation.\r"

  ".U": "91191309\r", 
  ".W": "Osteoporosis in RA is mediated by numerous inflammatory substances. This study was undertaken to see if SAARD could modify the rate of metacarpal bone loss in RA. Combined cortical thickness (CCT) measured at the midshaft of the right second metacarpal was used to calculate bone mass (CA%) using a digitizer. Eighty-one subjects were studied, all of whom had at least three sets of hand X-rays, the last of which was approximately 18 months following initiation of SAARD therapy. There were 12 males and 69 females. The mean age at time of starting therapy was 51 (SD 12) years while the mean duration of disease at the time was 7.6 (SD 8) years. The mean time to referral for SAARD from the general clinic was 2.5 (SD 3) years. The percentage fall in bone mass prior to therapy was 2.51%/day compared to a gain of 0.6%/day after therapy (P less than 0.05). Forty-nine patients were aged over 50 years while 32 were 50 years or younger at the time of study. Comparison showed that in the pretreatment period, the rate of change in CCT and CA% was not significantly dependent age (P less than 0.1). During that therapy, the rate of change in CCT and CA% significantly different in the two age groups. Patients aged over 50 years continued to lose bone, but at a slower rate (P less than 0.05). Patients aged 50 years or less either stopped losing or gained metacarpal bone mass during the study period (P less than 0.005). The time to referral for SAARD and disease duration (comparable in the two age groups) did not have a significant effect on changes in CA% during therapy. Change in bone mass could be predicted by change in disease activity. We conclude that SAARD have a significant sparing effect on metacarpal osteoporosis in RA. This positive effect is masked by the overwhelming influence of age (and menopause) and could be missed. Metacarpal osteoporosis seems a pathophysiologically more useful measure of radiological change in RA than erosions or joint space narrowing.\r"

Patients with smaller initial deviations were also more likely to exhibit stereoacuity (p = 0.016), as were those with smaller manifest deviations on final testing (p less than 0.001). Patients with amblyopia on final testing were less likely to demonstrate stereoacuity (p = 0.0001). Generally, the more intervention required in the form of optical or surgical correction, the poorer the level of binocularity.\r"

The absence of the disorder in the parents of three affected siblings can be explained by autosomal recessive inheritance, autosomal dominant inheritance or germ-line mosaicism. Each affected member showed iris stroma hypoplasia, miotic pupils and defects of the iris pigment epithelium. Less frequently encountered features included increased axial length, high myopia and congenital cataract. Most of the abnormalities can be accounted for by a disturbance in the growth and development of neural crest cells of the anterior chamber angle.\r"

Specular microscopy and pachymetry were done before surgery and a mean of 8 or more weeks after surgery. The mean percent cell loss was 8.2% in the PMMA group and 10.7% in the poly-HEMA group. There was no significant difference in the pachymetry values before or after surgery between the two groups; however, in the poly-HEMA group the postoperative value was significantly higher than the preoperative value (p = 0.027). The results suggest that the amount of perioperative corneal endothelial cell loss with poly-HEMA lenses is similar to that with PMMA lenses. Further study is needed to fully evaluate the long-term corneal effects of poly-HEMA lenses.\r"

At autopsy the characteristic dysmorphic features (hypertelorism, high, prominent forehead, micrognathia and low-set, malformed ears) and numerous other congenital malformations were observed. Bilateral microcornea with opacities was noted. Histopathological examination of the eyes showed dysgenesis of Bowman's membrane, with glycosaminoglycan deposition and a series of structural anomalies that form part of the anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD) complex. To our knowledge this is the first case of partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 2 in which the ocular histopathological features have been studied. Our case provides a further example of the association of ASMD with a chromosomal abnormality.\r"

All patients 55 years and older admitted to the NKI for primary treatment of breast cancer between 1981 and 1986 were selected. For women 75 years and older, physicians were less likely to use treatment of adjuvant radiation therapy after a mastectomy and more often employed primary hormonal therapy only for local stage disease than for younger patients. Life-table analysis showed that disease-specific survival at 7 years for patients 65 through 74 years of age was significantly better (65%) than that of the youngest (55%) and the oldest age group (50%). In multivariate regression analysis (Cox), age older than 74 years was significantly and independently associated with a shorter disease-specific survival as compared with patients younger than 75 years. This difference in survival, however, does not seem to be the result of the difference in treatment between the age groups, but suggests an influence of age-related factors such as comorbid diseases and weak physical condition, which manifest themselves most strongly in the oldest age category and make the older woman more vulnerable to the course of malignant disease.\r"

The authors prospectively monitored the evolution of neuropathy and myopathy during an intensive 12-week chemotherapy program for patients with intermediate and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study, vincristine was administered by bolus injection followed by a 3-day continuous intravenous (IV) infusion (total dose of 2.0 mg/m2 every other week); the maximum dose of vincristine was not arbitrarily limited. Cronassial, a mixture of four naturally occurring gangliosides, was administered in a randomized double-blind test to evaluate whether this agent could prevent vincristine-induced neuropathy. High doses of dexamethasone (50 mg/d for 3 days weekly or every other week) were also prescribed. Patients were monitored every 4 weeks with comprehensive physical and neurologic examinations and electrophysiologic studies of peripheral nerve function. Twenty-seven patients were fully evaluable. Weakness was a prominent adverse reaction in this study, and all patients had moderate to severe signs and symptoms of neuropathy and myopathy. Cronassial (100 mg) administered by intramuscular (IM) injection daily provided no protection against the development of neuropathic symptoms. Vincristine typically impaired fine-motor coordination initially, whereas corticosteroids were associated with delayed development of proximal muscle weakness. Results of electrodiagnostic studies did not add to the clinical examination results. The authors conclude that symptomatic weakness due to neuropathy or myopathy appears in a predictable manner during intensive vincristine/corticosteroid-based treatment protocols. Simple clinical tests can be used to rapidly distinguish between toxic effects due either to vincristine or corticosteroids, and routine implementation of these tests can prevent inappropriate dose attenuation of these agents.\r"

Median age was 58.5 years of age (range, 32 to 78 years). Performance status was 0, 1, 2, and 3 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale for 13, 19, 9, and 1 patients, respectively. Thirty-six patients had undergone partial resection, and six had stereotactic biopsy only. All patients had histologically proven astrocytomas (6 Grade 3, and 36 Grade 4). Treatment consisted of radiation therapy doses of 4400 cGy in 22 daily fractions to the whole brain plus a boost of 1600 cGy in 8 fractions given concomitantly with the last 8 whole-brain treatments using a twice daily schedule with an interfraction interval of 8 hours. Median survival time was 57 weeks from the date of starting irradiation. Survival was 50% and 28% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Alopecia and scalp erythema were seen in all patients; nine patients had localized areas of moist desquamation in the retroauricular region. Decreased hearing and serous otitis media were seen in five patients within 1 to 2 months from the end of treatment. Increasing somnolence was marked in eight patients with progressive deterioration of performance status; computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan studies in all eight patients showed evidence of disease recurrence with associated brain edema and mass effect. Three patients had a second resection for a recurrent tumor with no evidence of brain necrosis at craniotomy. To date, the accelerated fractionation schedule appears to be well tolerated with valuable shortening of overall treatment time. The preliminary results are encouraging, and longer follow-up time is required to evaluate tumor control and toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer were treated with sequentially administered methotrexate (MTX) and piritrexim (PTX). The treatment schedule consisted of intravenous (IV) MTX (50 mg/m2) administered on day 1 and oral PTX (75 mg/m2) administered twice daily on days 8 to 12. Courses were repeated every 21 days with dose escalation in subsequent courses aimed at achieving Grade 1 toxicity. Two patients were not evaluable for response, 5 (17%; 95% confidence interval, 4% to 30%) had a partial response (PR), 10 had stable disease, and 13 had progressive disease. All five responses were seen in patients with regional lymph nodes as measurable disease. The median time to progression for all patients was 1.4 months, and the median survival was 6.7 months. Generally, this regimen was well tolerated with only mild toxicity seen during cycle 1 in the majority of patients. Dose escalation in subsequent cycles was possible in a high percentage of patients. Although the overall response rate and survival figures in this Phase II trial were disappointing, the doses and schedule used in this trial may have been suboptimal as reflected by the low incidence of moderate to severe toxicity. Additional evaluation of this combination of drugs in a more aggressive schedule may be warranted.\r"

Twenty-two of these children had CNP initially and 23, at relapse, with or without previous hematologic relapse. Only one of the 23 patients with CNP at relapse was a long-term survivor. In contrast, 11 of the 22 children who had CNP initially survived in remission for 3+ months to 13+ years. Two factors are associated with an improved outcome for patients with CNP at diagnosis: treatment after 1979 (P less than 0.004) and male gender (P less than 0.01). Patients who received radiation therapy fared better than those for whom radiation was not given (disease-free survival at 2 years 53% versus 29%). The authors conclude that CNP signifies an aggressive or advanced disease requiring intensive systemic chemotherapy and that the role of irradiation should be examined for this group of patients.\r"

This study was done to determine the effect of recombinant growth hormone on primary tumor growth, tumor metastasis, and carcass weight in tumor-bearing animals. Twenty-seven female Lobund/Wistar rats with subcutaneous prostate tumor implants (PA-III) were randomized to receive a standard protein diet (22.0% protein; 4.27 kcal/g) or an isocaloric, protein-depleted diet (0.03% protein; 4.27 kcal/g) ad libitum orally. One half of the animals in each group were randomized to receive daily injections of either recombinant growth hormone (1000 mU/kg/day intramuscularly) or placebo (saline) for 14 days. A significant increase in body weight was observed in growth hormone-treated animals without acceleration of primary tumor growth. Spontaneous pulmonary metastasis was inhibited significantly in animals in both dietary groups treated with growth hormone. Thus, growth hormone selectively supports host growth and inhibits pulmonary metastasis in this tumor-bearing animal model. The potential metabolic effects and clinical consequences of treating cancer patients with growth hormone is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for estrogen and for androgen in the nucleus and cytosol (ERn, ERc, ARn, and ARc, respectively) were studied on two newly established human esophageal carcinoma cell lines, ES-25C and ES-8C. ES-25C was ERn+ (the binding content 4.0 fmol/mg protein, Kd 0.09 nM), ERc-, ARn-, and ARc-. No receptors were found in ES-8C. Various doses of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were added in vitro to investigate its effect on the growth of these cell lines. No effect of E2 was observed on ER--ES-8C cell line. The growth of ES-25C cell was significantly inhibited at the doses of 10(-10) and 10(-12) mol/l E2 compared with the control. The doubling time of 10(-12) mol/l E2-treated cells was 32 hours whereas that of control was 20 hours. This slower growth was reflected in the deduction of cells in S-phase utilizing 5-bromo 2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling. The current results strongly suggest that the growth inhibition of ER+ esophageal cancer cell by E2 is mediated by signal transduction induced by the estrogen-estrogen receptor system.\r"

For evaluating the DNA histogram this was analyzed with the help of automatic single-cell cytophotometric study. The method, contrary to that of flow cytometric study, allows for the selective analysis of tumor cells due to the electronically, previously given selection criteria, whereas artifacts, stroma, and infection cells remain excluded from analysis. The multivariate analysis shows that the prognosis is only correlated with DNA content of the tumor cells. Patients with diploid tumors had a median survival time of 32 months as compared with the 22 months of patients with hypotriploid tumors, and 6.5 months with hypertriploid tumors. DNA cytometric analysis should be included when diagnosing patients with esophagus carcinoma.\r"

The mean B-2M of all breast cancer patients plus or minus one standard deviation (3.5 +/- 1.2; range, 1.1 to 5.9) was significantly higher than normal controls (1.29 +/- 0.49; range, 0.3 to 2.3; P less than 0.005). When the three patient groups were compared with each other, the mean B-2M level of Group A (3.0 +/- 1.5; range, 0.9 to 6.9) was similar to that of Group C (4.22 +/- 1.1; range, 2.0 to 6.4). The mean B-2M of both Groups A and C was significantly higher than that of Group B (2.38 +/- 1.02, range, 0.4 to 5.4; P less than 0.001). In Group A the mean B-2M decreased significantly after a 12-month period and reached the mean level of Group B but not that of normal controls. When patients in Group B were analyzed by their stage of disease at diagnosis, there was no significant difference between Stages I and II. There was a significant difference in the mean B-2M levels between Stages I and III. In relapsing patients, mean B-2M levels increased. These findings suggest that serum B-2M levels may reflect tumor burden, and even in patients at follow-up, occult tumor cells may activate the immune system.\r"

Three patients with thyroid lymphoma presented with an increasing goiter, two with positive serum antithyroid antibodies, and one patient had chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLTH). The histologic type of surgically resected specimens was a diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells with monocytoid appearance, i.e., abundant pale cytoplasm with distinct cell border and small reniform nucleus. These cells were CD20+, 22+, 24-, 9- showing their B-cell origin. The monoclonal nature of the proliferating cells was confirmed by restricted expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain and/or gene rearrangement study in three cases. Two cases of thyroid lymphoma in which the monoclonality could not be confirmed had histologic appearances characteristic of malignant lymphoma. All three patients with gastric or rectal lymphoma had reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) near the tumors. These findings showed presence of MBCL in the extranodal sites with invariable coexistence with lymphoid follicles formed by CLTH in thyroid or RLH in stomach and rectum.\r"

Fifty-one patients were male and 32 were female (male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1); CBCL primarily involved the elderly (median age, 58 years). A locoregional extension of the disease was quite frequent (86.7%). The neoplastic cells showed a range of appearances reminiscent of the whole spectrum of follicular/parafollicular cells. The antigenic phenotype of tumor cells (CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, CD28+, CD10-, CD5-, MB2+, CD74+/-, CDw75+/-, MT2+/-, surface immunoglobulin + monoclonal/-) plus the presence of admixed CD14- dendritic reticulum cells suggest a mantle-zone nature for CBCL. The nonaggressive clinical behavior with a substantial tendency to remain localized to a limited area of the skin, the quite good response to nonaggressive treatment, and the dichotomy existing between the enhancement of morphoimmunologic atypism--which parallels the increasing age and growth rate of lesions--and the constant benign overall prognosis on long-term follow-up make CBCL a unique type of lymphoma of low-grade malignancy. Proper recognition of CBCL is mandatory to avoid possible undertreatment or overtreatment of the patients affected.\r"

The population doubling time of TC-YIK was approximately 21.6 hours at the 119th subculture. Subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10(8) TC-YIK cells into nude mice yielded a solid tumor. The cytologic appearance of TC-YIK was similar to that of YIK-1. The TC-YIK cells contained argyrophil granules and neurosecretory granules in the cytoplasm and showed positive immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase, serotonin, and chromogranin. Thus, TC-YIK retained the histochemical characteristics of ASCC. The TC-YIK cells contained HPV16 DNA in a multiple-copy integrated form and actively transcribed the integrated HPV16 genome. Amplification of the c-myc oncogene was observed in the TC-YIK cells. These data suggest that TC-YIK is a useful in vitro experimental model of ASCC and that HPV16 and c-myc may play some role in the genesis of this malignant tumor and/or maintenance of the transformed TC-YIK phenotype.\r"

A higher aneuploid rate has also been reported in metastatic melanomas than in primary lesions. The ploidy profile was determined of 26 primary melanomas and their first subsequent secondaries on Feulgen-stained sections from routinely processed material using a computerized video image-analysis system. In 18 of 26 cases, both primary and secondary tumor showed similar corresponding DNA patterns. These were aneuploid in 13 of 18 of the cases. A hyperdiploid pattern was present in one case in both the primary and its metastasis, and a diploid pattern was seen in four cases. There were only eight cases in which a disparity between the nuclear ploidy profile in the primary and secondary tumor was evident. Although the results suggest that ploidy studies are not useful for predicting the metastatic potential of a primary melanoma, the maintenance of similar DNA profiles in the metastases in most of these cases was interesting in regard to tumor biology.\r"

No significant differences between GS and GBM were found with regard to age, sex, pretreatment Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, size, median survival (8.3 and 9.6 months, respectively), and actuarial survival. None of the treatment regimens, which included various combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, improved the survival of GS over GBM.

The squamous epithelial islands contained central lumens lined by eosinophilic cuticles and were surrounded by a densely cellular fibrous matrix, thus closely resembling the growth pattern of dermal eccrine syringomas. The lesions appeared to arise de novo from breast parenchyma without evidence of transitions with the surrounding normal or hyperplastic mammary epithelium and were not associated with the overlying skin or nipple epidermis. In all cases, the surrounding breast tissue showed fibrocystic and benign proliferative changes, and in one case, the lesion was found in the vicinity of a large cyst surrounded by microcalcifications. All patients were treated by local surgical excision and have shown no evidence of recurrence over a follow-up period of 1 to 6 years. The histologic differential diagnosis and the possible pathogenesis of these lesions are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary blastoma is a rare lung tumor composed of immature mesenchyme and/or epithelium that morphologically mimics embryonal pulmonary structure. The prognosis of these tumors is poor, and the clinical course is not readily predicted from histologic appearance. In this report, the clinical, gross, microscopic, and immunopathologic features of 52 cases are described, and prognostically important correlates are determined. Twenty-eight patients were women, and 24 were men. There was a unimodal age peak in the fourth decade; only two patients were younger than 10 years old, and both had biphasic blastomas. Forty-one percent of patients were asymptomatic. Chest radiography typically showed a peripheral or midlung mass without predilection for any lobe. Microscopically, tumors could be divided into two classes: those composed solely of malignant glands of embryonal appearance (well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas [WDFA], 28 cases) and those with a biphasic appearance (24 cases). The malignant epithelium contained cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, milk fat globulin, and often chromogranin; vimentin, actin, and less frequently desmin and myoglobin were present in malignant stromal cells. More often WDFA was a smaller tumor (less than 5 cm) than biphasic tumors (P less than or equal to 0.001). It was more likely to be asymptomatic (P less than or equal to 0.001), and it was less likely to show pleural effusion by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.01) or giant or bizarre tumor cells (P less than or equal to 0.001) or frequent (greater than or equal to 30 mitoses/10 high-power fields) mitoses in the microscopic sections (P less than or equal to 0.01). Only 14% of patients with WDFA died of their tumor; 52% of patients with biphasic tumors died (mean follow-up, 97 months and 49 months, respectively). For patients with WDFA, the presence of thoracic adenopathy by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.001) and metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.001), followed by tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.01), were the factors most highly correlated with poor prognosis. For patients with biphasic tumors, tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.001) was the most significant indicator of poor prognosis, followed by metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.05) and gross size of the tumor (greater than or equal to 5 cm) (P less than or equal to 0.05). These findings support the idea that histologic class and gross and clinical findings can be of prognostic value in pulmonary blastoma.\r"

  ".W": "For 52 patients with depressed adenomas of the stomach, histopathologic studies were done on 56 tumors and for 43 of them, histochemical and immunohistochemical features were examined. In addition, nondepressed adenomas (n = 57) and the depressed type of early gastric adenocarcinomas of the well-differentiated variety (n = 44) were studied as the controls. Depressed adenomas in the majority (73%) involved the entire thickness of the mucous membrane of the stomach with tubules of atypical epithelium, presenting a severe grade in many of the cases (41%). Paneth's cells were found in cases of a depressed adenoma, in significantly higher percentages (61%) than in those with a nondepressed adenoma (P less than 0.01). The frequency of cases with argyrophil cells was also higher in depressed adenoma (63%) than in nondepressed adenoma (36%) or in cases of early gastric carcinoma (32%). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 were noticed in tumor cells, immunohistochemically in 28% of the cases with depressed adenoma, the frequency being intermediate between cases of a benign nondepressed adenoma (6% for both CEA and CA 19-9) and cases of early gastric carcinoma (71% for CEA and 66% for CA 19-9). No difference was noticed in lectin reactivity and mucin content between depressed and nondepressed adenomas, whereas tumor cells in the early depressed carcinoma had a higher lectin reactivity and less mucin content than those seen in the adenomas. It would thus appear that depressed adenoma is a benign neoplastic lesion; however, the malignant potential of this lesion is somewhat higher than the nondepressed counterpart, as indicated by the immunoreactivity to tumor markers and follow-up results reported by colleagues previously.\r"

  ".W": "The degrees of glucosaminylation (glucosaminylation index) and fucosylation (fucosylation index) of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were determined in serum samples of 351 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 47 with carcinoma metastatic to the liver from digestive organs, five with mixed cholangiocellular and HCC, and 176 with benign liver diseases. The glucosaminylation index of AFP in patients with carcinoma metastatic to the liver (42 +/- 23%, mean +/- SD) was significantly higher than that in patients with HCC (5 +/- 7%, P less than 0.001) or that in patients with benign liver diseases (2 +/- 4%, P less than 0.001). The fucosylation indices of AFP in patients with carcinoma metastatic to the liver, with HCC, and with benign liver diseases were 76 +/- 25%, 42 +/- 30%, and 4 +/- 6%, respectively. Thus, the fucosylation indices of AFP were high in two neoplastic liver diseases (carcinoma metastatic to the liver and HCC) and low in benign liver diseases, whereas the glucosaminylation indices were high in carcinoma metastatic to the liver but low in HCC and benign liver diseases. When the values of 30% and 80% were used as the level of the glucosaminylation and fucosylation indices, respectively, to discriminate carcinoma metastatic to the liver from HCC, 40 of 47 patients with carcinoma metastatic to the liver (85%) were able to be discriminated from HCC (sensitivity). The specificity, the positive predictive value, and the overall accuracy were 86% (302/351), 45% (40/40 + 47 + 3 - 2) and 86% (40 + 302/47 + 351), respectively. These data suggest that the combined information in these two indices provides a potent criterion for the diagnosis of neoplastic diseases of the liver.\r"

  ".W": "When pancreatography shows a stenosis of the main pancreatic duct in patients with normal or inconclusive ultrasound and computed tomography, the exact nature of such stenosis is sometimes difficult to precise before surgical exploration. In such cases, the authors systematically performed a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of the stenosis under pancreatographic guidance. Fifteen patients were referred because of suspected pancreatic malignancy. The tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were normal in 11 patients and elevated in one patient, whereas only CA 19-9 was elevated in three others. In 14 cases, both the ultrasound and computed tomography did not show any obvious pancreatic mass. The pancreatography was done through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (12 patients) or percutaneously in case of failure at ERCP3 and showed a main pancreatic duct stenosis that underwent aspiration by percutaneous fine needle precisely positioned using biplane fluoroscopy. The aspirated material was then smeared on glass slides, air-dried, and stained by Giemsa. In nine of the 15 patients, cytologic study revealed adenocarcinoma. This was confirmed by surgery in five and by progressive deterioration followed by death in four. In six patients, cytologic study gave a nonmalignant result. Chronic pancreatitis was found in five of them, confirmed at surgery in three and based on uneventful follow-up of at least 12 months in two others. In one case, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma not detected by cytologic study was found at surgery. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic approach were 90% and 100%, respectively. No serious complication was noticed. The authors conclude that when ultrasound and computed tomography are inconclusive, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of main pancreatic duct stenosis under pancreatographic guidance is a safe, simple, and helpful procedure in the investigation of patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy.\r"

Both women were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and had no risk factors for such an infection. The patients' CD4 lymphocyte counts increased after chemotherapy for breast carcinoma was discontinued. Thus, it appears that the therapy they received may have caused severe T-lymphocyte mediated immunosuppression.\r"

In 78 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of various causes the HYA concentration was measured in pleural fluid samples and in serum. Nine patients had malignant pleural mesothelioma, and in three of them the HYA level in pleural fluid was 100 mg/l or more. In 42 patients with effusions due to metastatic malignancy, the mean HYA in the pleural fluid was 75 mg/l, and in five the HYA level was above 100 mg/l. Cardiac insufficiency caused the effusion in 11 patients, of whom two had a level above 100 mg/l in pleural fluid. Four patients had a serologically confirmed viral infection and had HYA levels in pleural fluid of 8, 157, 335, and 554 mg/l, respectively. One patient had postinfectious effusion with an HYA level in pleural exudate of 748 mg/l, the highest in this investigation. Two patients had benign asbestos pleural effusions, and both had high pleural HYA levels (256 and 490 mg/l, respectively). The serum HYA values were much lower than in the pleural fluid, namely from 15 to 480 micrograms/l; the levels were independent of the levels in the pleural fluid. Thus, a high level of HYA in pleural fluid is not specific for mesothelioma but can occur in other malignant or benign diseases, and a low level does not exclude mesothelioma.\r"

Previously, small cell carcinoma of the vulva has been treated with regional therapy including surgery and radiation. Survival has been poor, however, due to the propensity of these tumors to metastasize early in the course of the disease. Recently, the median survival of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung has been improved with the use of chemotherapy. The authors review the literature on the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the vulva and report on a patient who was treated successfully with vulvectomy and inguinal lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

The clinical indications were claudication (84%), nonhealing ulcer (7%), and renovascular hypertension (7%). Rotablation was successful in 78 of 82 lesions (95%): 68 of 71 (96%) stenoses (12 of 12 iliac, 11 of 11 femoral, 7 of 8 popliteal, 36 of 37 tibial, and 2 of 3 renal arteries; 60% of lesions were diffuse, i.e., greater than or equal to 4 cm in length), and 10 of 11 (91%) occlusions (5 of 6 femoral, 1 of 1 popliteal, 3 of 3 tibioperoneal, 1 of 1 brachial artery). The Rotablator significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced the arterial obstruction (stenoses: 85 +/- 11% to 12 +/- 12%); occlusions: 100% to 25 +/- 10%). The effective final burr size for arteries varied at 3.5-4.5 mm for renal, 3.0-3.5 mm for femoral, and 2.0-3.0 mm for brachial and tibial. Complications included gross hemoglobinuria without sequelae in 27 patients (63%), groin hematoma in 10 (23%), arterial spasm in 10 (23%), and arterial bypass in 2 (5%). The Rotablator was successfully used, without concomitant conventional balloon angioplasty, to open arterial lesions with excellent angiographic results in both diffuse and segmental peripheral vascular disease. There was gratifying patient clinical improvement.\r"

Among 1,275 PTCA procedures performed between 1984 and 1988 in 1,035 consecutive patients, 42 double wire procedures were applied (4%) to protect and/or dilate major coronary side branches. A total of 80 coronary stenoses were attempted of which 76 were located on a bifurcation and 4 on other segments. In the first 11 patients (group A), 2 guiding catheters were used and PTCA of each vessel was successfully performed by means of separate double lumen over-the-wire balloon catheters. In the next 31 patients (group B), 2 guidewires were advanced through a single guiding catheter and PTCA was attempted using \"Monorail\" balloon catheters sequentially advanced over the wires. In group B, a successful PTCA was obtained in 29 patients (93%) but twisting of the wires hampered balloon progression in 5 cases, such that dilatation could only be performed by stepping back to a single wire technique. The procedure time in group B was significantly shorter than in group A: 144 +/- 30 versus 230 +/- 52 minutes (p = .01). Repeat angiography was performed in 35 out of 40 patients (87%) after a mean of 180 +/- 46 days following successful PTCA. Angiographic restenosis was present in 37% (24/65) of bifurcation segments which, in our experience, is not significantly different from the angiographic restenosis rate in less complex lesions (248/740; 34%; NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The well-known limitations of balloon angioplasty include unpredictable abrupt closure, chronic total occlusion, diffuse disease, and restenosis, among other factors. These limitations have prompted the development of new technologic approaches to angioplasty including laser applications for plaque ablation, mechanical device applications for plaque removal/debridement, and stent devices for structural maintenance of vascular lumen patency. Devices which directly apply laser energy for ablation of plaque material include a balloon-centered laser angioplasty system, excimer laser ablation catheter systems, and a fluorescence-guided spectral feedback laser system. Experience with these devices indicates that plaque can be successfully ablated by using laser energy. Vessel perforation and dissection are complications reported with these devices and the effects of laser angioplasty on restenosis remain unclear. Indirect application of laser energy has been tested by using a \"hot tip\" catheter and a laser balloon angioplasty system. Although the hot tip device has received FDA approval for use in peripheral arteries, it appears to have very limited applications in the coronary arteries. Laser balloon angioplasty appears to be beneficial in the setting of threatened acute closure; the device continues to be evaluated for potential beneficial impact on restenosis. Mechanical atherectomy catheters are designed to remove atherosclerotic plaque from the arterial system and include the AtheroCath, the Transluminal Extraction Catheter (TEC), and the Pullback Atherectomy Catheter (PAC). The Rotablator is an atheroablation device which debrides the obstructing plaque material with distal embolization of the particulate debris. Successful removal/debridement of atherosclerotic plaque has been demonstrated with the AtheroCath, Rotablator, and the TEC device. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate successful removal of plaque material with the PAC device. Despite the theoretic advantage of removing plaque material when performing angioplasty with these devices, there has been little or no reduction in restenosis rates based on a significant experience with the AtheroCath and the Rotablator. Intravascular stent devices including one self-expanding device design and two balloon-expandable device designs have been employed successfully in the elective setting to treat recurrent restenosis lesions. Two of the devices have been successfully tested in the setting of threatened acute closure. Early follow-up studies suggest some improvement in restenosis rates in certain clinical settings following intravascular stenting. Acute and subacute thrombosis remain substantial problems for stent devices and very aggressive anticoagulation regimens are necessary to minimize the adverse events. In summary, a number of a new technologic approaches for treatment of atherosclerotic lesions have been developed and are undergoing significant clinical evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We performed a prospective, randomized trial comparing percutaneous balloon commissurotomy with surgical closed commissurotomy in 40 patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Data were analyzed by investigators who were masked to treatment assignment or phase of study. Patients randomized to balloon (n = 20) or surgical (n = 20) commissurotomy had severe mitral stenosis without significant baseline differences (left atrial pressure, 26.1 +/- 4.2 versus 27.6 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient, 18.0 +/- 4.2 versus 19.7 +/- 6.3 mm Hg; mitral valve area, 1.0 +/- 0.2 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4 cm2, respectively). At 1-week follow-up after balloon commissurotomy, pulmonary wedge pressure was 14.3 +/- 7.2 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient was 9.6 +/- 5.1 mm Hg; and mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 (all p less than 0.0001). At 1-week follow-up after surgical closed commissurotomy, wedge pressure was 13.7 +/- 5.4 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient was 9.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (both p less than 0.0001); and mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p less than 0.003). At 8-month follow-up, improvement occurred in both groups: Mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 in the balloon commissurotomy group (p less than 0.002) and was 1.8 +/- 0.6 cm2 in the surgical closed commissurotomy group (p less than 0.0001). There was no difference between the groups at 1-week or 8-month follow-up (all p greater than 0.4). One case of severe mitral regurgitation occurred in each group; complications were otherwise related to transseptal catheterization. There was no death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Cost analysis revealed that balloon commissurotomy may substantially exceed the cost of surgical commissurotomy in developing countries, whereas it may represent a significant savings in industrialized nations. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that percutaneous balloon commissurotomy and surgical closed commissurotomy result in comparable hemodynamic improvement that is sustained through 8 months of follow-up.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the most useful factors for identifying acute MI patients treated with aggressive interventional therapy who could be safely discharged on day 4. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 708 patients enrolled in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction trials I-III. Patients dying in the first 3 days and those with early (days 1-3) emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), late elective CABG (greater than or equal to day 4), or urgent/emergency CABG resulting from a late elective coronary angioplasty were excluded. The remaining 580 patients were randomly divided into a training sample (group 1) that was used to build a logistic regression model for predicting the absence of a late major complication and a test sample (group 2) that was used to validate this model. For this study, patients were considered appropriate for day 4 hospital discharge if they did not experience any of the following for 30 days after MI: death, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, sustained hypotension, sustained ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular block, acute ventricular septal defect, and recurrent ischemia necessitating urgent CABG. In group 1, four variables were independent predictors of freedom from late major complications: absence of early sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, absence of early sustained hypotension or cardiogenic shock, fewer coronary arteries with significant (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis, and a higher left ventricular ejection fraction. In group 2, 23% of patients had a logistic model prediction of a 3% or less chance of a late complication. These patients had no deaths or reinfarctions by day 30 and a 3% late major complication rate. CONCLUSIONS. The results of early cardiac catheterization and the absence of selected early (days 1-3) major complications do allow identification of a low risk subgroup of acute MI patients that may be suitable for very early discharge.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite much evidence that modifying risk factors for coronary heart disease can decrease morbidity and mortality, little is known about the impact of risk-factor modification on life expectancy. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a state-transition computer simulation of the US population, to forecast potential gains in life expectancy from risk-factor modification for the cohort of Americans turning age 35 in 1990. Among 35-year-old men, we projected that the population-wide increase in life expectancy would be about 1.1 years from strict blood pressure control, 0.8 years from smoking cessation, 0.7 years from reduction of serum cholesterol to 200 mg/dl, and about 0.6 years from weight loss to ideal body weight. For women, reducing cholesterol to 200 mg/dl would have the greatest estimated impact-a gain of 0.8 years-whereas smoking cessation, blood pressure control, or weight loss would yield population-wide gains of 0.7, 0.4, and 0.4 years, respectively. Gains for 35-year-old individuals having a given risk factor are greater. We estimate that, on average, male smokers would gain 2.3 years from quitting smoking; males with hypertension would gain 1.1-5.3 years from reducing their diastolic blood pressure to 88 mm Hg; men with serum cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mg/dl would gain 0.5-4.2 years from lowering their serum cholesterol level to 200 mg/dl; and overweight men would gain an average of 0.7-1.7 years from achieving ideal body weight. Corresponding projected gains for at-risk women are 2.8 years from quitting smoking, 0.9-5.7 years from lowering blood pressure, 0.4-6.3 years from decreasing serum cholesterol, and 0.5-1.1 years from losing weight. Eliminating coronary heart disease mortality is estimated to extend the average life expectancy of a 35-year-old man by 3.1 years and a 35-year-old woman by 3.3 years. CONCLUSIONS. Population-wide gains in life expectancy from single risk-factor modifications are modest, but gains to individuals at risk can be more substantial.\r"

New diagnostic methods based on computer analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram and multivariate analysis have improved the diagnostic value of exercise testing in male subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the diagnostic value of exercise testing can be enhanced in women by using multivariate analysis of exercise data. METHODS AND RESULTS. Between 1978 and 1984, 135 infarct-free women underwent exercise testing and coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease was present in 41% of the patients. In this first group, maximal exercise variables were submitted to a stepwise logistic analysis. Work load, heart rate, and ST60X were selected to build a diagnostic model. The model was tested in a second group of 115 catheterized women (significant coronary artery disease in 47%) and of 76 volunteers. We compared the present model with conventional analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram, with ST changes adjusted for heart rate, and with a previously described analysis. In both groups, sensitivity was better with the present model (66% and 70%) than by conventional (68% and 59%) and by the previously described analysis (57% and 44%) without a loss of specificity (85% and 93%). Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed also a better diagnostic accuracy with the present model. CONCLUSIONS. In women, logistic analysis of exercise variables improves the diagnostic value of exercise testing. It yields a significantly better sensitivity without a loss of specificity.\r"

To test directly for sympathetic reinnervation in humans, we measured the cardiac release of norepinephrine (NE) in response to tyramine (an agent that causes NE release from intact sympathetic nerve terminals) and sustained handgrip exercise (a reflex sympathetic stimulus) in 12 patients less than 5 months after CT, in 50 patients 1 year or more after CT, and in eight patients without CT. Plasma [NE] was measured in the aorta [( NE]Ao) and coronary sinus [( NE]CS) at rest, after tyramine administration (55 micrograms/kg, i.v.), and during sustained handgrip exercise. Cardiac NE release was determined by subtracting [NE]Ao from [NE]CS [( NE]CS-Ao). NE release was defined as [NE]CS-Ao during the intervention-[NE]CS-Ao at rest (delta [NE]CS-Ao). In patients studied within 5 months of CT, no significant NE release occurred after tyramine administration (delta [NE]CS-Ao, 33 +/- 18 pg/ml; range, -98 to 117 pg/ml) or handgrip exercise (delta [NE]CS-Ao, -34 +/- 10 pg/ml; range, -46 to 8 pg/ml; n = 10). Conversely, in 39 of 50 patients studied 1 year or more after CT, tyramine administration caused a significant cardiac NE release (delta [NE]CS-Ao, 500 +/- 59 pg/ml; range, -11 to 1,918 pg/ml), and handgrip exercise caused a significant NE release in 17 of 41 patients (delta [NE]CS-Ao, 189 +/- 34 pg/ml; range, -211 to 949 pg/ml). In normally innervated patients, tyramine caused an even larger NE release (delta [NE]Ao-CS, 1,943 +/- 210 pg/ml; range, 1,152 to 2,977 pg/ml), and handgrip exercise caused a significant NE release in two of seven patients (delta [NE]CS-Ao, 143 +/- 51 pg/ml; range, -15 to 338 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS. Early after CT, neither tyramine nor handgrip exercise caused a significant cardiac release of NE, suggesting sympathetic denervation. Late after CT, most patients had a significant, but subnormal, NE release in response to pharmacological or reflex stimuli, suggesting that limited sympathetic reinnervation occurs in most patients after orthotopic CT.\r"

We studied this hypothesis (linking) in 10 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in whom antegrade preexcitation could be persistently blocked by overdrive atrial pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS. An atrial pacing protocol, with a decremental ramp followed by an incremental ramp, defined a range of atrial paced cycle lengths (linking window) associated with both persistent conduction and block in the accessory pathway. Within the limits of the linking window, the ability of an atrial impulse to conduct over the accessory pathway was dependent on the preceding state (i.e., conduction or block). The observed linking window ranged from 70 to 290 msec (mean, 185 +/- 68 msec) and closely approximated the measured delay in retrograde activation of the accessory pathway during persistent antegrade block. The mean antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathways was long (486 +/- 156 msec), and in each case, it exceeded the antegrade refractory period of the normal atrioventricular pathway. Critically timed premature ventricular extrastimuli, delivered while linking was maintained in the accessory pathway, were able to interrupt the linking and restore antegrade accessory pathway conduction. CONCLUSIONS. These observations suggest that accessory pathway linking is associated with bidirectional block in the accessory pathway. The ability to initiate linking (and the stability of the phenomenon) depends on a critical relation between antegrade accessory pathway refractoriness and the magnitude of retrograde accessory pathway activation delay.\r"

The site of the reentrant circuit in atrioventricular (AV) junctional reentrant tachycardia has not been defined; in particular, the existence of a common pathway of AV nodal tissue above the reentrant circuit is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. Two types of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia were induced in each of three patients at electrophysiological study. In one type of tachycardia (anterior), the onset of atrial activity occurred from 0 to 12 msec before the onset of ventricular activation, and earliest atrial activity was recorded near the His bundle. In the second type of tachycardia (posterior), the ventriculoatrial intervals were longer (76-168 msec), and earliest atrial activity was recorded near the mouth of the coronary sinus. In individual patients, the two types of tachycardia had different cycle lengths. Posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia was not a fast-slow form of AV junctional reentry in at least two of the three patients. Surgical cure was attempted in two patients. In one patient, anterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia was abolished by dissection of the anterior perinodal atrium, but posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia could still be induced. At reoperation 4 months later, dissection of the posterior perinodal atrium abolished posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia while preserving AV conduction. CONCLUSION. Differences in ventriculoatrial intervals and cycle lengths and the results of selective surgery suggest that the two types of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia used different reentrant circuits. These observations imply that a common pathway of AV nodal tissue is not present above the reentrant circuit and suggest that perinodal atrium is part of these circuits.\r"

  ".U": "91191745\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection immediately after conventional stress-redistribution imaging improves the detection of viable myocardium, as many myocardial regions with apparently \"irreversible\" thallium defects on standard 3-4-hour redistribution images manifest enhanced thallium uptake after reinjection. Because the 10-minute period between reinjection and imaging may be too short, the present study was designed to determine whether 24-hour imaging after thallium reinjection provides additional information regarding myocardial viability beyond that obtained by imaging shortly after reinjection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 50 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing exercise thallium tomography, radionuclide angiography, and coronary arteriography. Immediately after the 3-4-hour redistribution images were obtained, 1 mCi thallium was injected at rest, and images were reacquired at 10 minutes and 24 hours after reinjection. The stress, redistribution, reinjection, and 24-hour images were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 127 abnormal myocardial regions on the stress images, 55 had persistent defects on redistribution images by qualitative analysis, of which 25 (45%) demonstrated improved thallium uptake after reinjection. At the 24-hour study, 23 of the 25 regions (92%) with previously improved thallium uptake by reinjection showed no further improvement. Similarly, of the 30 regions determined to have irreversible defects after reinjection, 29 (97%) remained irreversible on 24-hour images. These findings were confirmed by the quantitative analysis. The mean normalized thallium activity in regions with enhanced thallium activity after reinjection increased from 57 +/- 13% on redistribution studies to 70 +/- 14% after reinjection but did not change at 24 hours (71 +/- 14%). In regions with irreversible defects that were unaltered by reinjection, mean regional thallium activity did not differ from the reinjection to the 24-hour studies (57 +/- 17% and 58 +/- 17%, respectively). Twenty-four-hour imaging after reinjection showed improvement in only four of 35 irreversible regions (involving three of the 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that thallium reinjection at rest after 3-4 hours of redistribution provides most of the clinically relevant information pertaining to myocardial viability in regions with apparently irreversible thallium defects. Hence, thallium reinjection may be used instead of 24-hour imaging in most patients in whom a persistent thallium defect is observed on conventional redistribution images.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET: two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring with dipyridamole infusion up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) is a useful tool for the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Aims of the present study were to assess the effects of antianginal drugs on dipyridamole-induced ischemia and to evaluate whether drug-induced changes in DET response may predict variations in exercise tolerance. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty-seven patients with angiographically assessed significant coronary artery disease (greater than 70% lumen reduction in at least one major coronary vessel) performed a DET and an exercise electrocardiography test (EET) in random order both off treatment and on antianginal drugs (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates, alone or in various combinations). The criterion for DET positivity was a transient dyssynergy of contraction absent or of a lesser degree in the baseline examination. In DET, two parameters were evaluated: the dipyridamole time (i.e., the time from onset of dipyridamole infusion to obvious dyssynergy) and the wall motion score index. DET sensitivity was 91% off therapy and fell to 65% under therapy (p less than 0.01). In the 37 patients who had a positive DET both off and on therapy, the dipyridamole time increased from 6 +/- 3 (off therapy) to 8 +/- 3 minutes (on therapy) (p less than 0.01). The wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole went from 1.38 +/- 0.14 to 1.31 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.01). EET and DET yielded concordant (positive versus negative) results in 41 of 57 (71%) patients off and in 35 of 57 (61%) on therapy (p = NS). In the subgroup of 38 patients with both positive DET and EET without treatment, the therapy-induced variations in exercise time were significantly correlated with the variations in dipyridamole time (r = 0.5; p less than 0.01), not with variations in wall motion score index (r = 0.3; p = NS). CONCLUSIONS. 1) Antianginal therapy can protect from dipyridamole-induced ischemia and 2) the therapy-induced changes in DET response parallel variations in exercise tolerance and might be useful for the objective, exercise-independent assessment of the therapy efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has provided guidelines for identification of persons at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) because of lipid abnormalities. These recommendations are based on total cholesterol as the initial screening tool and have become the stimulus for clinic- and community-based screening programs nationwide. However, the use of the guidelines may be problematic because individuals may have total cholesterol levels in the desirable range but low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels considered at high risk. This study evaluates the ability of the NCEP screening recommendations to identify correctly persons at high risk of CHD because of lipid abnormalities. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using the NCEP guidelines, we simulated a population-based screening program with data from visits 1 and 2 of the Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study. Individuals were considered to be at high risk of CHD if they had LDL levels greater than 160 mg/dl or HDL levels less than 35 mg/dl. Following the NCEP process, 21% of those with high LDL concentrations and 66% of those with low HDL concentrations would not be routinely referred for immediate treatment. Overall, 41% of those at high risk of CHD would not be promptly evaluated. The sensitivity of the guidelines for promptly identifying individuals with lipoprotein abnormalities is 59%. CONCLUSIONS. This relatively low sensitivity of total cholesterol as a screening tool should be the impetus for rethinking the screening guidelines. Specifically, the cost-benefit ratio of routine screening for lipoproteins, particularly HDL cholesterol, needs to be carefully considered.\r"

Although specific guidelines for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia have been published, it is not known whether physicians treating patients likely to have lipid disorders have adopted the recommendations. METHODS AND RESULTS. The approach of cardiologists to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in a metropolitan teaching hospital was assessed by interviewing patients with chest pain who were admitted for coronary angiography in 1988-1989 and by measuring fasting blood lipid profiles. At 1 month and again 12-24 months later, patients were contacted by telephone to determine if there had been any changes in treatment. Of 95 patients evaluated, 81 had coronary artery disease. Only 17% of those with high levels of total cholesterol and/or low density lipoprotein cholesterol were being actively treated with diet and/or drugs. In the remaining patients, either lipid studies had not been done or abnormal results had not been addressed. There was little change in treatment approach during the month after the diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, the experience was similar in those patients subjected to coronary revascularization. One to 2 years after the initial intervention, 69 of the original study group could be contacted again. Although active dietary or pharmacological therapy was initiated in some individuals during this interval, it was stopped in others. Thirty-five percent of hypercholesterolemic patients were receiving targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, only a small proportion of patients with documented coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia were being actively treated for their lipid disorder, suggesting that the published treatment guidelines have not yet been fully accepted. However, an encouraging improvement in frequency of treatment of hypercholesterolemia was documented during the 1-2-year observation period.\r"

A better understanding of the relation between blood pressure and blood lipids may provide insight into the mechanism(s) whereby hypertension is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. We assessed the cross-sectional relations of serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol (total minus HDL cholesterol), and triglyceride levels with blood pressure in a population of 8,081 men 20-54 years old and 7,663 women 20-49 years old. Stratified analyses and multivariable methods were used to control for potential confounding anthropometric and lifestyle variables. Total and non-HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly with increasing systolic or diastolic blood pressure in both sexes. Men 20-29 years old had steeper regression slopes for blood pressure by total cholesterol level than did women of similar age. In men, the association between blood pressure and total cholesterol level decreased with age, whereas in women, it increased with age. Body mass index modified the relation, whereas smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption had little influence on the association. Triglyceride levels increased with blood pressure, but this relation was weak in lean subjects. HDL cholesterol level correlated positively with blood pressure in population subgroups having a high alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION. These results support the hypothesis that there are biological interrelations between blood pressure and blood lipids that may influence the mechanisms whereby blood pressure is associated with risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".U": "91191753\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The transmural distribution of fiber angles and the extent of shortening among obliquely oriented fibers are likely to be major determinants of the twisting motion that accompanies left ventricular (LV) ejection. As such, measurements of torsion may provide useful information about LV contractile function, but other factors, such as ventricular loading conditions, may also regulate this motion. METHODS AND RESULTS. Torsion angles (theta i) of midventricular and apical regions were measured relative to a reference minor axis near the base in seven human cardiac allografts from biplane radiographic images of metallic midwall markers. Pressure loading with methoxamine (5-10 muk/kg/min) increased LV end-systolic pressure by 41 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Volume loading with normal saline raised LV end-diastolic pressure from 9.9 +/- 5.2 to 19.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). These alterations in LV loading conditions were associated with no change in theta i (difference not significant) for any marker site. Inotropic stimulation with dobutamine (5 micrograms/kg/min) increased values of theta i by as much as twofold (p less than 0.05); this response varied considerably depending on marker location, with the middle and apical inferior wall and the apical lateral wall being the most sensitive. When the marker site associated with the largest torsion angle (theta max) was considered in each patient, dobutamine increased theta max in all cases (25.2 +/- 10.5 degrees versus 15.8 +/- 7.7 degrees, p less than 0.001), whereas pressure and volume loading had negligible effects. This 59% increase in theta max was greater than that of conventional load-dependent indexes of LV systolic performance such as stroke volume (16%), ejection fraction (22%), and maximum rate of LV pressure rise (52%). CONCLUSIONS. This component of LV motion is relatively insensitive to alterations in preload and afterload, while changes in contractile state influence LV torsion in a regionally heterogeneous manner. Quantification of LV torsion may, therefore, provide a sensitive and relatively load-independent measure of contractile performance that may prove to be useful in the serial assessment of LV function.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The purpose of the present study was to assess the inhibitory effect of DuP 753, an orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous angiotensin I and II in healthy male volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the first study (single-dose study), eight volunteers were included in a 2-day protocol repeated four times at 1-week intervals. In each phase, a different dose of drug (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or placebo was given. The peak systolic blood pressure response to a test-dose of angiotensin I was determined serially before and after oral administration of DuP 753 by continuously monitoring finger blood pressure using a photoplethysmographic method. DuP 753 reduced the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I in a dose-dependent fashion. Three, 6, and 13 hours after the 40-mg dose, blood pressure response decreased to 31 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 6%, and 45 +/- 3% of the control values (mean +/- SEM, n = 7), respectively. In the second study, 29 volunteers were treated for 8 days with either a placebo or DuP 753 (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg p.o. q.d.) and challenged on the first, fourth, and eighth days with bolus injections of angiotensin II. Again, the inhibitory effect on the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin II was clearly dose dependent. Six hours after 40 mg DuP 753, the systolic blood pressure response to the test-dose of angiotensin II was reduced to 37 +/- 7%, 40 +/- 4%, and 38 +/- 6% of baseline values (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) on days 1, 4, and 8, respectively. With this latter dose, there was still a blocking effect detectable 24 hours after the drug. Similar to angiotensin converting enzyme and renin inhibitors, DuP 753 induced a dose-dependent increase in plasma renin that was more pronounced on the eighth than on the first day of drug administration. In these normal volunteers, no consistent clinically significant side effects were observed. There was no evidence for an agonist effect. CONCLUSIONS. DuP 753 appears to be a well-tolerated, orally active, potent, and long-lasting antagonist of angiotensin II in men.\r"

  ".U": "91191757\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The mechanisms underlying repetitive activity during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium are thought to include triggered responses elicited at short pacing cycle lengths. The potential to generate repetitive responses at longer pacing cycle lengths under similar conditions, however, has not been explored. Thus, the present study examined the role of cycle length on the cellular electrical changes produced during recovery from ischemic-like conditions and identified the major component precipitating nondriven, repetitive activity. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmembrane potentials were recorded in vitro from isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers exposed to hypoxia (defined as PO2 less than 30 mm Hg, high [K+]o, and zero glucose) plus lactic acidosis (pH 6.7) for 45 minutes and during recovery in normal Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4). Compared with control, action potential duration (90% repolarization) during recovery increased transiently by 40.9 +/- 11.8 and 241.0 +/- 51.1 msec at respective basic cycle lengths of 1,000 and 3,000 msec (both p less than 0.005). In 81% of preparations, action potential prolongation was accompanied by early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity generated from low (positive to -40 mV) or high (negative to -40 mV) membrane potentials. In 62% of experiments, brief periods of abnormal automaticity also occurred. Triggered responses were 1) unaffected by 1 microM ryanodine, 2) abolished by pacing at short basic cycle lengths or by exposing tissues to 2.5 micrograms/ml lidocaine, and 3) more easily induced at long basic cycle lengths or by superfusing 2.5 micrograms/ml quinidine. When tissues were conditioned with hypoxia alone (pH 7.4), action potential prolongation on recovery was comparatively small, and nondriven responses did not develop. Conversely, addition of 10-20 microM amiloride to the hypoxic, acidic test solution augmented recovery-induced action potential prolongation. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that acidosis, as a component of ischemia, plus slow pacing frequencies may mediate the genesis of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers on recovery, long after extracellular pH has been restored to normal. These data may have clinical relevance to the mechanisms of reperfusion arrhythmias in the intact human heart.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In pigs and humans, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) supplies the left ventricular anterior wall (LVAW), anterior septum, and paraseptal band of the right ventricular anterior wall (RVAW). The purposes of our study were 1) to study the LAD flow distribution in these walls during preexercise, exercise, and exercise with LAD stenosis and 2) to analyze regional wall motion under these conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Nine pigs were instrumented with sonomicrometers for measuring percent wall thickening (%WTh) in LVAW, RVAW, and lateral (control) walls of both ventricles, a hydraulic occluder at the LAD origin, an LV pressure transducer, and catheters for radioactive microsphere injection (left atrium) and blood withdrawal (aorta). One month later, regional %WTh and flows were measured during preexercise, exercise, and continuing exercise with LAD stenosis resulting in more than 50% reduction in systolic LVAW %WTh with regard to exercise. LAD stenosis caused a dramatic decrease in total mean +/- SD LVAW subendocardial flow with regard to exercise (28.7 +/- 8 to 9.1 +/- 3.2 ml.min-1, p less than 0.0001) but not significant changes in either LVAW subepicardial flow or RVAW flow. The transmural distribution of flows within the LAD bed (as percentages of the total LAD flow in each experimental condition) showed that LAD stenosis redistributed flows with regard to exercise such that the LVAW subendocardial flow decreased from 26.4 +/- 4.2% of the total LAD flow to 11.8 +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.0001), whereas LVAW subepicardial flow increased from 32.9 +/- 2.3% of the total LAD flow to 45.5 +/- 7.9% (p less than 0.0001) and RVAW increased from 12 +/- 4.9% of the total LAD flow to 18.7 +/- 7.2% (p less than 0.0005). With exercise plus LAD stenosis, LVAW %WTh decreased from 43.2 +/- 8.4% to 17.2 +/- 9.7% (p less than 0.0001), but RVAW %WTh did not change. CONCLUSIONS. In the LAD bed of exercising pigs, LAD stenosis induces, in addition to transmural steal, an interventricular steal favoring the RVAW at the expense of the LVAW subendocardium. This steal results in preserved RVAW thickening despite severe LVAW hypokinesia.\r"

To answer such questions, we developed an animal model of this disorder. The brisk thrombolytic response of canines to acute embolism has, previously, prevented the establishment of such a model. METHODS AND RESULTS. The fibrinolytic inhibitor tranexamic acid was given orally to canines before, and for intervals after, pulmonary emboli were released from venous thrombi formed in vivo in femoral veins or the inferior vena cava. Preliminary studies disclosed that embolic residuals from femoral vein thrombi were not sufficient to cause significant, persistent pulmonary hypertension. With repetitive, larger thrombi embolized from the inferior vena cava, however, persistent pulmonary hypertension was achieved in most animals. CONCLUSIONS. Resolution of emboli in the canine can be inhibited by tranexamic acid. As in humans, a spectrum of embolic residuals is encountered, and the perfusion lung scan consistently underestimates the extent of embolic residuals. Studies of this animal model continue.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Little is known about the mechanism(s) in the development of restenosis after excimer laser angioplasty. Thus, the rationale of this study was to determine the time course of intimal and medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and histomorphological changes after experimental excimer laser treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser ablation was performed in the right carotid artery of 34 New Zealand White rabbits after development of a fibromuscular plaque by repeated weak electrical stimulations. The vessels were excised 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after excimer laser treatment. Staining of alpha-actin was used to identify SMCs. In five rabbits (15%), a stenosis of more than 50% of luminal area was due to intimal proliferation of SMCs, and in four other rabbits, a total occlusion was due to organized thrombi. After the initial ablation of the performed plaque (13 +/- 6 intimal SMC layers) a continuous increase of intimal wall thickness was found from 7 +/- 6 SMC layers at 7 days to 28 +/- 5 intimal SMC layers at 28 days after excimer laser ablation (p less than 0.01). After 42 days, no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. After bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the extent of cell proliferation (percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis) in the intima and media was determined using a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistological quantification of SMC proliferation in the intima revealed a significant increase of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 3 (p less than 0.05) and 14 (p less than 0.01) days after laser treatment. Medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and had a significant increase 7 days (p less than 0.05) after intervention. Twenty-one days after laser treatment, SMC proliferation in the intima as well as in the media was normalized. CONCLUSIONS. The proliferative response of SMCs after experimental excimer laser treatment will occur as a dynamic process with a maximum of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis during 14 days after laser ablation, resulting in an increase of intimal thickening within 4 weeks after laser treatment. The extent of intimal hyperplasia due to SMC proliferation after excimer laser treatment is comparable with the effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty in this experimental model.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The hypothesis that increases in coronary perfusion increase ventricular performance independently from providing enhanced oxygen supply (\"Gregg phenomenon\") remains controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. To study the physiological significance of changes in coronary perfusion on global and regional myocardial function in situ, the left anterior descending coronary artery of isoflurane-anesthetized swine was cannulated, and perfusion was varied. In one group of swine (n = 5), coronary arterial pressure was increased in four steps from 88 +/- 11 to 186 +/- 11 mm Hg by increasing the speed of the pump circuit providing coronary blood flow. No changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, peak pressure, or maximum left ventricular dP/dt were observed. Subendocardial blood flow (by radiolabeled microspheres) increased from 0.96 +/- 0.27 to 2.04 +/- 0.73 ml/min/g without any increase in systolic wall thickening (by sonomicrometry) or myocardial oxygen consumption of the anterior myocardium. In a second group of swine (n = 8), coronary arterial pressure was kept constant and coronary blood flow was increased stepwise by intracoronary adenosine infusion. End-diastolic pressure, peak pressure, and maximum left ventricular dP/dt remained unchanged when coronary blood flow increased from 21.7 +/- 9.8 to 93.8 +/- 34.1 ml/min. Subendocardial blood flow increased from 0.89 +/- 0.26 to 3.28 +/- 1.02 ml/min/g, again without any increase in systolic wall thickening (45.6 +/- 8.6 versus 42.6 +/- 9.8%) and myocardial oxygen consumption (5.75 +/- 1.18 versus 5.87 +/- 1.67 ml/min/100 g). In a third group of swine (n = 10), coronary arterial pressure was lowered by intracoronary adenosine infusion during constant coronary inflow. Left ventricular hemodynamics remained unchanged. With a decrease in coronary arterial pressure from 130 +/- 25 to 71 +/- 14 mm Hg, no decreases in subendocardial blood flow and systolic wall thickening were observed. Only when coronary arterial pressure was further reduced to 57 +/- 13 mm Hg did systolic wall thickening fall to 25.7 +/- 9.9% (control, 31.1 +/- 11.1%), associated with a decrease in subendocardial blood flow from 1.17 +/- 0.39 to 0.87 +/- 0.52 ml/min/g. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, the Gregg phenomenon plays no significant role within or above the autoregulatory pressure-flow range normally seen in anesthetized swine in situ.\r"

  ".U": "91191762\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor has been shown to be nitric oxide or a related nitroso compound, synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide synthetase, which oxidizes the guanidono nitrogens of arginine. This enzyme is activated by increases in cytosolic calcium. The effect of the clinically used calcium channel antagonists on this process is controversial. The present study was performed to determine whether calcium channel blockade with these pharmacologic agents would alter the activity of nitric acid synthetase in intact endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS. A specific and sensitive chemiluminescence assay was used to measure the release of nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and one-electron oxidation products of nitric oxide) from bovine aortic endothelial cells grown in culture. Under basal conditions, the release of nitrogen oxides was about 0.2 nmol/100 micrograms protein/hr. Bradykinin doubled this response. Removal of extracellular calcium abolished basal and bradykinin-stimulated release of nitrogen oxides. Neither diltiazem, verapamil, nor nifedipine in concentrations that are encountered clinically altered the release of nitrogen oxides. CONCLUSIONS. These experiments show that although the production of nitrogen oxides is dependent on extracellular calcium, the clinically used calcium channel antagonists do not inhibit the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The mechanisms by which ventricular function is altered during cardiac transplant rejection are not well understood. Therefore, an in vitro model system has been developed to facilitate investigation of lymphocyte-mediated myocyte injury. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splenic lymphoid cells were obtained from mice 8-10 days after placement of a vascularized abdominal cardiac allograft and were restimulated in vitro with irradiated donor-type splenocytes for 5 days. Cytotoxic effects of these allogenically stimulated lymphocytes on syngeneic and donor strain fetal cultured myocytes were determined by a 51Cr release assay at different lymphocyte to myocyte ratios. 51Cr release from donor strain myocytes was detectable within 1 hour of exposure, was maximal by 3-5 hours of coincubation with sensitized lymphocytes, and was allospecific. Cell injury manifest by 51Cr release was calcium dependent and was inhibited by pretreatment of lymphocytes with phorbol ester to deplete protein kinase C. Myocyte injury was also prevented by pretreatment of sensitized lymphocytes with anti-Thy 1.2 or anti-CD8 antibody plus complement but not by treatment with anti-CD4 antibody, indicating that CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are involved. Altered myocyte contractile motion preceded myocyte lysis (51Cr release), was characterized by an initial reversible decrease in amplitude of contraction, and was followed by rapid and irregular beating with eventual complete cessation of contraction. Contractile alterations induced by sensitized lymphocytes were inhibited by elimination of CD8+ cells. CONCLUSIONS. Myocyte injury can be produced by sensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and is calcium and protein kinase C dependent. The contractile abnormalities produced appear to be similar to those observed in cardiac transplant patients undergoing rejection, and thus this model system promises to allow investigation of the mechanisms involved.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can distinguish normal from infarcted myocardium. Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter. The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours. A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction. Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively. The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x). Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk). However, UTC underestimated both infarct size and area at risk. CONCLUSIONS. Ultrasonic tissue characterization may provide a reliable, noninvasive method to estimate myocardial infarct size.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, could ameliorate the toxic effects of cocaine on the myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS. In an initial protocol, anesthetized dogs were pretreated with nifedipine or saline and then administered cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.v. bolus). Coronary blood flow, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the first derivation of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) were measured at baseline, 2 minutes, and 15 minutes after cocaine administration. Nifedipine pretreatment prevented the early cocaine-induced decrease in coronary blood flow and improved left ventricular dP/dt compared with untreated control animals. After cocaine, ejection fraction fell in the saline group to 37 +/- 3% but increased in the nifedipine group to 59 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). In a second protocol, vehicle or intravenous nifedipine was administered after an infusion of cocaine (10 mg/kg). In contrast to pretreatment, there was no significant improvement in left ventricular function or coronary blood flow in nifedipine-treated versus control animals. Data from the study also suggested that cocaine acts directly on the myocardium. Within seconds of cocaine bolus administration, coronary blood flow in control animals increased to a peak level 59 +/- 14% higher than before cocaine and left ventricular dP/dt decreased by 23 +/- 5%, providing evidence that cocaine causes direct depression of myocardial function independent of a decrease in myocardial blood flow. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that nifedipine administered as a pretreatment protects against the depression of myocardial function and decrease in coronary blood flow caused by acute cocaine administration. However, when nifedipine is given after cocaine, no improvement is seen. Cocaine has a direct negative inotropic effect on the heart that is independent of a decrease in coronary blood flow.\r"

The recent reduction in stroke frequency rates in these areas is thought to be the result of better hypertension control. In the Ni-Hon-San Study, the level of hypertension and its frequency were similar in Hawaii and Japan, but ischemic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were less frequent in Hawaii. Reduced meat and fat intake may contribute to small vessel disease in Japan. Stroke is the third major cause of death among Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans, yet there is a paucity of information, especially about stroke, in subgroups of these populations. There is also considerable ignorance and controversy about risk factors for stroke in these populations. The need for additional research is urgent.\r"

This suggested differences in the permeability of capillaries underlying these epithelia. Therefore, the fine structure of mouse subepithelial villus and follicle capillaries and their permeability to selected macromolecules was compared. Fenestrae, abundant in villus capillaries, were extremely rare in dome capillaries as assessed by electron microscopy of tissue sections and freeze-fracture replicas. Two minutes after IV-injected horseradish peroxidase and 9 minutes after IV-injected hemoglobin, reaction product decorated the pericapillary space of 97% and 95%, respectively, of capillary profiles in the upper half of villi but only 28% and 2%, respectively, of capillary profiles in the upper half of patch domes. Reaction product was intense surrounding most villus capillaries but, when present, was faint in dome capillary adventitia. These results indicate that most subepithelial capillaries in mouse Peyer's patch domes, unlike those in villi, generally lack endothelial fenestrae, and the dome capillary network is less permeable to some macromolecules than that of the villus.\r"

In this study, in situ hybridization techniques were used to delineate the kinetics and cellular source of induced interleukin 1 beta in acute experimental colitis. The induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA was an early phenomenon and occurred predominantly in undifferentiated cells located in the basal part of the mucosal crypts but not in differentiated enterocytes. The undifferentiated enterocytes retained the messenger RNA during differentiation and migration to more apical parts of the crypts. These results suggest that induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA in enterocytes is causally related to the subsequent inflammatory changes seen in acute experimental colitis.\r"

In the present study, rats were treated for 14 days with the hydrogen-potassium-stimulated ATPase inhibitor omeprazole, and the effects on plasma and tissue gastrin concentrations and on the abundance of gastrin messenger RNA were examined. To calculate the fractional release rates of gastrin, the metabolic clearance rate of synthetic unsulfated rat heptadeca peptide gastrin in anesthetized rats was also measured. Treatment with omeprazole for 14 days led to a profound hypergastrinemia, a twofold increase in antral gastrin stores, and a tenfold increase in messenger RNA. Calculations based on the metabolic clearance rate for rat heptadecapeptide gastrin suggested that in control rats, about 0.08% of stored gastrin was released per minute compared with about 0.4% in omeprazole-treated rats. No evidence was observed to suggest that changes in the efficiency of conversion of Gly-extended gastrins to amidated peptides were of any significance in accounting for the increased production of amidated gastrin. The increased gastrin synthesis in achlorhydria is therefore attributable to increased messenger RNA levels; most of the increase in gastrin production is directly secreted as changes in the stores of gastrin appear to be of lesser importance.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on gastric acid secretion was examined in the isolated, luminally perfused mouse stomach. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide caused a weak, transient increase in basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion and a sustained increase in somatostatin secretion. The sustained increase in somatostatin despite return of acid to basal levels indicated that somatostatin secretion was a direct response to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and not mediated by intraluminal acidification. The increase in somatostatin secretion was partly responsible for the weak, transient nature of the acid response since incubation with pertussis toxin, which is known to block the inhibitory effect of exogenous and endogenous somatostatin, converted the acid response to a sustained increase throughout the period of stimulation. The inhibitory influence of somatostatin was confirmed with selective vasoactive intestinal polypeptide antagonists. The antagonists inhibited vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-induced somatostatin secretion but caused a sustained increase in acid secretion. The pattern of response implied that somatostatin secretion was more sensitive than acid secretion to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide antagonists and that suppression of somatostatin eliminated the main inhibitory influence on acid secretion. In addition, both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide antagonists inhibited basal somatostatin secretion, implying that input from tonically active vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons is responsible, at least in part, for basal somatostatin secretion.\r"

Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment.\r"

All three peptides were found to double the mean lesion area when compared with that induced by ethanol, whereas substance P antagonist (1 mumol/L per 100 g) prevented the expansion of damage extent. The increased damage was associated with increased gastric mucosal levels of platelet activating factor, leukotriene B4, and leukotriene C4. Substance P antagonists also reduced by half the extent of the gastric damage induced by ethanol when administered by itself. WEB 2086 (platelet-activating factor antagonist; Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Germany), hydroxyzine (H1 blocker), and cimetidine (H2 blocker) reduced lesion area by 50%, but only in rats treated with both substance P and ethanol. Ketotifen (mast-cell stabilizer) (100 micrograms/100 g), administered orally 30 minutes before damage induction, totally abolished the extent of the damage induced by either ethanol or the coadministration of ethanol and peptides in the surface epithelium of the entire mucosa. The protective effect of ketotifen was accompanied by significant reduction in mucosal generation of platelet-activating factor, leukotriene C4, and leukotriene B4. Similar mucosal protection was afforded by ketotifen against damage induced by 0.6N HCl, 25% NaCl, or indomethacin. Therefore, it is suggested that substance P is involved in the pathogenesis of acute ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage. The effective mucosal protection provided by ketotifen indicates the important role of mast cells and their mediators in the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal damage and may have therapeutic implications.\r"

Combinations of different grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were prepared as 2% or 3.3% solutions to yield input viscosities of low (approximately 5000 cp at 37 degrees C and 1 s-1), medium (15,000 cp), or high (30,000 cp) viscosity. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose modified intralumenal viscosity, with a linear relationship existing between input and lumenal viscosity. With regard to transit, the lag time before the onset of chyme recovery increased linearly as a function of luminal viscosity. There was also a pronounced decrease in the first-order emptying rate constant as lumenal viscosity increased from water to low-viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, but as viscosity was further increased there was little additional change. These results indicate that water-soluble fibers can exert a significant influence on both the lumenal viscosity and the transit profile in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\r"

In circular muscle, dopamine (10(-6)-10(-3) mol/L) induced contractions that were tetrodotoxin-insensitive with a concentration of half-maximal effect (EC50) of 6.3 x 10(-6) mol/L for dopamine vs. 1.4 x 10(7) mol/L for norepinephrine. The efficacies of dopamine- and norepinephrine-induced contraction were similar. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine competitively inhibited dopamine-induced circular contractions (Ki = 2.5 x 10(-8) mol/L slope 1.06), whereas the dopamine antagonist haloperidol had no effect. The alpha 1-antagonist prazosin competitively inhibited dopamine-induced contractions (Ki = 1.8 x 10(-8) mol/L, slope 1.03), whereas the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine was slightly less potent (Ki = 2.2 x 10(-7) mol/L, slope 1.15). In longitudinal muscle, dopamine produced relaxation with an EC50 of 2.9 x 10(-5) mol/L vs. 2.4 x 10(-6) mol/L for norepinephrine. Tetrodotoxin reduced relaxation to dopamine by one third at low doses of dopamine (10(-5)-10(-4) mol/L) and had no effect above 10(-3) mol/L. Phentolamine did not inhibit dopamine-induced relaxation, whereas haloperidol demonstrated potent competitive inhibition (Ki = 5.8 x 10(-7) mol/L, slope 0.90). The selective DA1 antagonist Sch 23390 (Research Biochemicals Inc., Natick, MA) showed competitive antagonism (Ki = 6.3 x 10(-6) mol/L, slope 0.98), whereas the selective DA2 antagonist domperidone had no effect. The effect of Sch 23390 was tetrodotoxin resistant. It is concluded that in the body of the guinea pig stomach, dopamine induces contraction in circular muscle through smooth muscle alpha adrenoceptors, whereas in longitudinal muscle, dopamine induces relaxation through smooth muscle DA1 receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91192515\r", 
  ".W": "Lipids, particularly surface-active phospholipids, have been proposed to provide an important protective barrier in the gastric mucosa. The predominant surface-active phospholipid in the pulmonary surfactant complex is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. To determine whether the gastric epithelium synthesizes and secretes this phospholipid, primary cultures of canine gastric mucous cells isolated by counterflow elutriation were studied. During the 24-hour period of culture, the gastric mucous cells incorporated 3H-choline into phosphatidylcholine, with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine representing 13.8% +/- 0.6% of the phosphatidylcholine synthesized. When mucous cell preparations with greater chief cell contamination were studied, they incorporated significantly less precursor into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Administration of prostaglandin E2, a cytoprotective agent, to the cultured mucous cells for 1 hour led to a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine release, reaching a maximum of 120.4% +/- 4.2% (P less than 0.001) at 10(-6) mol/L. No significant stimulation of phospholipid release by prostaglandin E2 was seen in the fractions containing a greater proportion of chief cells. To further establish the relationship between mucin and phospholipid secretion, two gastric cancer cell lines, Hs746T and KATO III, were studied. Using immunocytochemical and biochemical techniques, mucin synthesis and secretion were confirmed by these cell lines. The Hs746T cells were significantly more active in the secretion of both mucin and phospholipid than the KATO III cells. The Hs746T line secreted 5.7-fold more mucin and 7.3-fold more phospholipid than KATO III cells during a 24-hour period of culture. The association between mucin and phospholipids in an aqueous solution was also studied. Purified mucin in the concentration of 0.5-2 mg/mL of glycoprotein led to a significant dose-dependent increase in phospholipid solubility, suggesting the formation of a glycoprotein-phospholipid complex. The current studies indicate that the gastric mucous cell is the source of surfactant phospholipids as well as mucin. The synthesis and release of mucin and phospholipid are functions of the mucous cell that play a critical role in the primary defense of gastric epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "During a 13-year period, 213 patients with ulcerative colitis who had no clinical or endoscopic evidence of colonic carcinoma were enrolled in a biopsy surveillance program for dysplasia and carcinoma. The aims of the study were to determine whether such a program could decrease the cancer risk in this group of patients, to determine whether patients with a low risk of carcinoma could be identified, thus enabling them to retain their colon, and to accomplish these goals with a reasonable expenditure of resources. Eighteen patients had dysplasia detected in the initial biopsy specimens; 15 of these patients underwent colectomy, and 7 had unsuspected carcinoma (1 Dukes' stage A, 2 stage B, and 4 stage C). Eleven patients had dysplasia detected during follow-up; 7 of these patients had colectomy, and only 1 patient had carcinoma (Dukes' B). Dysplasia developed in 5 of 20 patients with indefinite changes on initial biopsy samples; 3 of these patients underwent colectomy, and 1 patient had carcinoma (Dukes' B). There was no difference in the prevalence of dysplasia between patients with left-sided disease and patients with extensive disease. With the exception of 2 patients with inadequate surveillance, there has been no clinical evidence of carcinoma in any of the 148 patients whose biopsy results remained negative throughout the study; carcinoma has not developed in any of 175 patients without dysplasia on initial biopsy sample. All 4 patients who died of carcinoma had high-grade dysplasia in their initial colonoscopic biopsy samples. It is concluded that a biopsy surveillance program can be an effective aid in helping control the risk of carcinoma in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis, that the short-term risk of carcinoma for patients with negative biopsy results is low and colectomy for risk of carcinoma can be deferred in this group, and that patients with extensive and left-sided disease share the same risk of the development of dysplasia.\r"

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, the effect of indomethacin on the gastric mucosal blood flow around ulcers was examined. Gastric ulcers were induced 5 days after submucosal injection of an acetic acid solution into the stomachs of rats. Blood flow was determined by the hydrogen gas clearance method. The blood flow around ulcers was significantly higher than that in rats without ulcers up to 2 weeks after ulceration but had returned to within the normal range 3 or 4 weeks later. Indomethacin, administered SC at 1 mg/kg once or repeatedly for 1-4 weeks, had little or no effect on the blood flow in normal rats. However, such treatment significantly reduced the blood flow by 20%-30% of the corresponding control levels in rats with ulcers. Prostaglandin E2, administered SC at 3 mg/kg once, markedly prevented the reduction in the blood flow due to indomethacin. The administration of prostaglandin E2, with indomethacin for 4 weeks resulted in a significantly higher blood-flow level than the control and prevented the delay in ulcer healing. Omeprazole, administered SC at 30 mg/kg once or repeatedly with indomethacin for 4 weeks, had an insignificant effect on the blood flow around ulcers but prevented the delay in ulcer healing. In conclusion, the delayed ulcer healing caused by indomethacin might be partly related to the reduced blood flow around the ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "Adenocarcinoma of the colon is one of the most prevalent and lethal of all human malignancies. The early diagnosis and management of this disease could be improved if biological markers, whose expression was restricted to malignant colon cells, were identified. Sucrase-isomaltase is a glycoprotein hydrolase expressed throughout the small intestine and fetal colon but not in the normal adult colon. This study shows that the expression of enzymatically active sucrase-isomaltase is a ubiquitous property of primary and metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Significant sucrase enzyme activity (i.e., greater than 5 mU/mg protein) was observed in 16 colon carcinomas but not in adjacent normal colon mucosa. Sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA was identified in all tumors using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, this study shows that the amount of sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA in tumors examined (3.4 x 10(-8) to 3.19 x 10(-7) micrograms/micrograms total RNA) was greater than in adjacent mucosa (0 to 3.4 x 10(-8) micrograms/micrograms total RNA). This induction of sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA and enzyme activity was corroborated by immunostaining. Of 30 colon adenocarcinomas examined, 80% were positive for sucrase-isomaltase. In addition, all colon carcinoma metastases examined were positive for sucrase-isomaltase. The staining pattern was distinct and demarcated tumor cells from the surrounding histologically normal tissue. No sucrase-isomaltase staining was seen in normal mucosa from the same patients. With the exception of lung, no sucrase-isomaltase immunostaining was observed in a variety of examined noncolonic adenocarcinomas. Thus, the specificity and ubiquity of sucrase-isomaltase expression in adenocarcinomas of the colon can be exploited to improve the clinical management of this disease. In addition, studies on the structure of the sucrase-isomaltase gene and its regulatory elements should contribute toward understanding the alteration of gene expression by oncogenic transformation of the colonic mucosa.\r"

Twenty-four consecutive resected specimens of small and large intestinal Crohn's disease were preserved by arterial perfusion-fixation with 10% formol saline, at mean arterial pressure (100 mm Hg). Fifteen specimens contained granulomas on routine examination of H&E-stained sections. These 15 specimens were examined in detail using a range of immunohistochemical staining techniques to identify vascular structures and granulomas. A total of 485 granulomas were found, 85% of which were identified as being directly involved in vascular injury. The majority (77%) of granulomas were deep to the mucosa; they were found most frequently in the submucosa (42%). The techniques used in this study enhanced the recognition of granulomatous vasculitis. The results suggest that the majority of granulomas in Crohn's disease form within walls of blood vessels. Vascular localization of granulomatous inflammation suggests that the intestinal microvasculature contains an early element in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.\r"

Twenty-eight children with vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus infection were evaluated for carbohydrate malabsorption using lactose hydrogen breath tests and d-xylose absorption studies. Lactose malabsorption was a common finding in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children and occurred in 8 of 20 patients who had no identifiable enteric pathogen. Lactose malabsorption occurred at an earlier age in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children than in an age-matched group of 45 symptomatic control children (P = 0.02). However, lactose malabsorption was not associated with higher rates of diarrhea or growth failure. Abnormalities in d-xylose absorption were not significantly associated with either diarrhea or growth failure. However, 39% of d-xylose studies (9 of 23) showed abnormal results and were significantly associated with enteric infections (P = 0.004). Abnormalities in small-bowel morphology were found in 4 of 9 children with growth failure, 3 of whom had an enteric infection and low d-xylose absorption. Lactose hydrogen breath testing and d-xylose testing showed carbohydrate malabsorption in 61% of children (17 of 28). This study demonstrates that human immunodeficiency virus-infected children are at risk for malabsorptive disorders, which are not always related to clinical symptoms. We speculate that human immunodeficiency virus may be directly involved in the development of lactose malabsorption. Carbohydrate malabsorption in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children may not be the only factor responsible for growth failure.\r"

In a prospective, nonrandomized two-center trial 43 patients treated with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser were compared with 30 patients treated by endoscopic intubation; the two groups were comparable for mean age and tumor position, length, and histology. Dysphagia was graded from 0 to 4 (0, normal swallowing; 4, dysphagia for liquids). Pretreatment mean dysphagia grades were similar: laser-treated group, 2.9 (SD, 0.6); intubated group, 3.2 (SD, 0.55). For thoracic esophageal tumors, the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in dysphagia grade by greater than or equal to 1 grade initially and over the long term was similar (laser, 95% and 77%; intubation, 100% and 86%). For tumors crossing the cardia, intubation was significantly better (laser, 59% and 50%; intubation, 100% and 92%, respectively; P less than 0.001). In patients palliated over a long period, however, the mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their lives (mean survival: laser, 6.1 months; intubation, 5.1 months) was better in the laser group (1.6 vs. 2.0; P less than 0.01); 33% of laser-treated and 11% of intubated patients could eat most or all solids (P less than 0.05). For long-term palliation, laser-treated patients required on average more procedures (4.6 vs. 1.4; P less than 0.05) and days in the hospital (14 vs. 9; P less than 0.05). The perforation rate was lower in the laser-treated group (2% vs. 13%; P less than 0.02); no treatment-related deaths occurred in either group. For individual patients, the best results are likely to be achieved when the two techniques are used in a complementary fashion in specialist centers.\r"

  ".W": "Neurohormonal factors were investigated in 10 patients with functional dyspepsia who had normal or slow upper gut transit and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Gastric and small bowel motility and transit, jejunal responses to luminal distention and IM neostigmine, gut hormones, and vagal and sympathetic functions were studied. Slow upper gut transit was defined by a gastric emptying slope less than 0.3%/min or 10% small bowel transit time greater than 300 minutes. Four patients with slow transit had reduced postprandial antral motility and gut hormone responses. Two of the four patients had vagal and sympathetic dysfunction. In 6 patients with normal transit, balloon distention in the jejunum was perceived at a lower volume (32.7 +/- 5.9 mL) than in controls (46.6 +/- 3.0 mL). Pressure responses to balloon distention were reduced in 5 and exaggerated in 1 patient; abnormal efferent vagal (2 patients) and sympathetic (1 patient) function were also documented. In view of the normal transit, motility, and jejunal pressure responses to neostigmine in all 6 patients, the abnormal response to distention suggests afferent dysfunction. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogenous disorder. Abnormal transit is sometimes associated with disorders of extrinsic neural control, but the latter are also found in patients with normal transit. Increased perception of intraluminal stimuli in those with normal transit suggests a disturbance in afferent function.\r"

It was possible to obtain liver function test results less than 2 years old in 94% of the patients and to obtain endoscopic retrograde cholangiographic results in 65 of the 72 patients with abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase values. Primary sclerosing cholangitis was diagnosed in 55 of the patients (3.7%). The prevalence of the disease was 5.5% in patients with substantial colitis and 0.5% in patients with distal colitis. There was a marked male predominance in cholangitis patients compared with colitis patients without cholangitis. Ninety-five percent of the patients with cholangitis had substantial colitis, which was more than the 62% of patients without cholangitis who had colitis. Female patients with cholangitis were older than male patients at the time of diagnosis of both cholangitis and colitis, which contrasted to the equal age at diagnosis of colitis in male and female patients without cholangitis.\r"

Doppler ultrasonography provides qualitative data on flow direction and pattern, thereby contributing significantly to diagnosis. Eight cases in which hepatic vein patency was unclear and presence of intrahepatic vessels resembling hepatic veins raised problems of interpretation in real-time ultrasonography are described. In some cases, patency or occlusion of the upper portion of the inferior vena cava were difficult to identify with real-time ultrasonography. Doppler ultrasonographic investigation showed flow in the hepatic veins to be completely absent in two cases and reversed in another two. In the remaining four cases, a flat waveform was evident. Flow in the inferior vena cava was reversed in four cases and showed a flat waveform in three other cases. Portal vein thrombosis was detected in only one case, whereas the remaining seven patients showed slow hepatopetal flow. These findings demonstrate that absent or reversed flow in the hepatic veins and/or flat flow in the hepatic veins associated with reversed flow in the inferior vena cava may be considered diagnostic for the Budd-Chiari syndrome. For this series the sensitivity of Doppler ultrasonography was 87.5%.\r"

The incidence of bleeding was 29%, and the mortality rate 46%. Endoscopic criteria (presence of varices in the gastric fundus, presence of the red color sign, and size of the largest varix) as well as alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis showed a significant positive correlation with the bleeding incidence but not with mortality.

  ".W": "Hematopoietic growth factors have recently been well characterized by complementary DNA cloning. For human epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor recombinant proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli. To reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy on the bone marrow, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 were applied to patients suffering of gastrointestinal cancers. To determine the influence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 on human pancreas and gastric cancer cell cells in vitro, a sensitive microculture test system was established that allows precise quantification of proliferation. A more than twofold enhancement of proliferation was observed by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in two of two cell cultures derived from gastric carcinoma cells, while two of nine cultures from pancreas carcinoma cells have shown enhanced cell growth in the presence of recombinant human interleukin 3 or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In comparison, recombinant human epidermal growth factor increased cell growth in two of two gastric and in five of nine pancreas carcinoma cultures. In general, 1-10 ng/mL of the growth factors yielded the highest growth rate, but even 1-pg amounts produced increased cell growth. Expression of messenger RNA for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and the oncogene HER2/neu remained undetectable in all of the tested cell lines, while the various abundance of messenger RNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor was different in each cell line. The reported results imply that the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor influence cellular growth of pancreas and gastric carcinoma cells by a paracrine mechanism and may possess a more general regulatory function than originally anticipated.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue damage during shock-wave lithotripsy is presumably secondary to cavitation phenomena involving the collapsus of gas bubbles in a fluid. To enhance shock-wave-related hepatic lesions, intravascular gas microbubbles were administered. Three groups of eight rabbits each received either 500 shock waves focused on the right hepatic lobe (group 1), gas microbubbles as a mixture of 50 cm3 of air with 50 cm3 of gelatin infused through an arterial catheter (group 2), or 500 shock waves and gas microbubbles simultaneously (group 3). In group 1, two animals had two to three subcapsular hepatic hematomas (diameter, less than 5 mm) and five had one to five intraparenchymal hematomas (less than 1 mm). In group 2, a moderate liver congestion was observed in three animals. In group 3, all animals had numerous subcapsular and intraperenchymal hematomas (2-30 mm). The hematomas were centered around the portal spaces, associated with lacunae (0.5-5 mm in diameter). Hematomas were also present on the anterior wall of intraabdominal organs. It was concluded that intravascular infusion of gas microbubbles into the path of a shock-wave generator dramatically enhances tissue damage. This technique, potentially useful in the treatment of hepatic tumors, needs refinement to confine lesions in a more uniform pattern to the targeted parenchyma.\r"

The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. Endosonography was accurate in the evaluation of the depth of tumor infiltration. Overall accuracy for common bile duct carcinoma and common hepatic duct carcinoma was 82.8% and 85%, respectively. Endosonography was helpful in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases but not accurate in diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes. With common bile duct carcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with progressive depth of tumor infiltration. No such correlation was found in common hepatic duct carcinomas. In the staging of distant metastasis, this technique was limited by the low-penetration depth of ultrasonography. Thus, additional transcutaneous ultrasonography or computed tomography was necessary for complete staging. The routine use of the biopsy channel for endosonographically guided aspiration puncture will further enhance the diagnostic value of endosonography in the future.\r"

Twelve of these patients had undergone a previous percutaneous or surgical pancreatic drainage procedure or both, and 8 had long-term drainage tubes in chronic fistulous tracts. Transpapillary catheters could be placed across the ductal disruption or directly into the fluid collection in each case, and 16 of 18 patients had resolution of the disrupted pancreatic duct. Twelve of 14 fluid collections resolved. Complications were limited to mild exacerbation of pancreatitis symptoms in 2 patients and 2 patients who developed subsequent stent occlusion leading to recurrent pancreatitis (1 patient) or recurrent duct blowout with pseudocyst (1 patient). Nine patients had variably significant ductal changes attributable to pancreatic duct stents. At a median follow-up of 16 months, 7 patients ultimately required surgery for ongoing pancreatic pain or residual/recurrent fluid collection. The transpapillary treatment of ongoing pancreatic ductal disruption with or without fluid collection has the potential to obviate surgery in some patients, change an urgent surgical procedure into an elective one, or even assist the surgeon in the performance of intraoperative pancreatography. Further study of this technique appears warranted and must be placed into the perspective of current therapies.\r"

Ketone body ratio in normal subjects increased after breakfast from 0.96 to 2.00, after lunch from 2.17 to 2.38, and after dinner from 1.23 to 2.55 with blood glucose level ranging from 103 to 141 mg/dL (5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L). By contrast, the ketone body ratio in the Child A or B group changed little and remained within a range of 0.70-1.35 despite a large change in blood glucose level from 102 to 176 mg/dL (5.7 to 9.8 mmol/L). Ketone body ratio in Child's class C remained near or below 0.4 with no response to glucose administration, despite a marked elevation in blood glucose level. These results indicate that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential undergoes diurnal changes in sharp response to meals in normal liver function but that these fluctuations are absent in patients with liver damage (Child's class A, B, and C). Furthermore, it remains at low levels in severe liver failure (Child's class C). It is also suggested that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels.\r"

Following portacaval shunting serum vitamin A concentration decreased to 25% of the level in sham-operated controls, whereas serum zinc concentration decreased to 80%. The mean urinary excretion rate of zinc increased in shunted rats [18.7 +/- 2.1 micrograms/day (0.28 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] compared with controls [13.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms/day (0.21 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] (P less than 0.01). The concentration of retinol and total retinoids in liver tissue increased 2-3-fold in rats with a portacaval shunt, and the ratio of retinol to retinoids was slightly increased. The differences were reduced when the total organ content was calculated, because of the reduced liver weight in the shunted rats. The concentration of zinc in liver tissue decreased in rats with portacaval shunts [30.8 +/- 4.9 micrograms/g wet wt (0.47 +/- 0.07 mumol/g) vs. 35.6 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g wet wt (0.54 +/- 0.06 mumol/g) in controls; P less than 0.01]. The concentration of zinc was inversely correlated with retinol (r = -0.52, P less than 0.05) and total retinoid levels (r = -0.70, P less than 0.05) in rats with portacaval shunts but not in controls. The data are consistent with the hypothesis of an impaired release of vitamin A from the liver in rats with portacaval shunts, an impairment that could be due to liver zinc deficiency.\r"

In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G neutrophil antibodies, neutrophil binding by primary sclerosing cholangitis sera was significantly greater than that for primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Similar differences were seen when sera from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis without evidence for ulcerative colitis were compared with sera from liver disease controls. Perinuclear immunofluorescence staining of neutrophils was exhibited by the majority of ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis without ulcerative colitis sera. The combination of elevated immunoglobulin G neutrophil antibodies and a perinuclear pattern was 65% sensitive and 100% specific for primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with the liver disease control sera. It is concluded that neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis may be markers of shared underlying immunopathogenic mechanisms. Identification of the target antigen(s) may facilitate understanding of the underlying immune response and development of an improved disease marker assay.\r"

Pancreatic function was significantly reduced in patients with hypothyroidism compared with healthy subjects. Treatment with thyroxine restored pancreatic function to normal.

Fourteen patients were either later found to have nonalcoholic liver disease or had already received treatment that excluded them from the protocol. The remaining 22 patients, who were treated with blood and fluid replacement, were monitored for up to 72 hours. Portal pressure was greater than 11 mm Hg in all patients (normal, less than 5 mm Hg) and did not change significantly over the 3 days of study. Portal pressure was significantly higher in the 9 patients who continued to bleed or rebled compared with the 13 patients who remained stable. The lowest pressure associated with continued bleeding or rebleeding was 16 mm Hg.

Eleven patients with alcoholic liver disease and bleeding varices were given vasopressin (0.2 U/min for the first hour, then 0.4 U/min for 24 hours). Portal pressure was monitored using an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter. Seventeen patients with variceal bleeding who remained stable over 26 hours of initial treatment with crystalloid and blood products served as a comparison group. Vasopressin infusion (0.2 U/min) produced a significant decrease in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient (wedged minus free hepatic venous pressure), and heart rate. Increases in the rate of infusion did not produce further decreases in the parameters measured, but the changes were sustained over the course of the infusion. Hemodynamics remained stable in the control group. Portal pressure did not increase when vasopressin was abruptly discontinued in the 3 patients in whom postinfusion measurements were made. Vasopressin retains its portal hypotensive effects in the setting of variceal hemorrhage. Tachyphylaxis does not develop over 26 hours, and a \"rebound\" increase in portal pressure probably does not occur when the infusion is discontinued.\r"

  ".W": "Previous morphological and electrophysiological studies have supported the hypothesis that interstitial cells of Cajal have important regulatory (pacemaker) functions in the gut. In the current study, interstitial cells of Cajal associated with Auerbach's plexus in human small intestine were studied. Freshly resected intestine was examined by light and electron microscopy. The interstitial cells of Cajal resembled modified smooth muscle cells. They had caveolae and dense bodies, an incomplete basal lamina, a very well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and abundant intermediate (10 nm) filaments. Myosin filaments were not seen. Fibroblast-like cells were distinguished by their lack of caveolae and dense bodies, the relative scarcity of smooth cisternae and intermediate filaments, and the abundant granular endoplasmic reticulum. Interstitial cells of Cajal were arranged in networks of bundles containing processes of two to seven cells with fibroblastlike cells interspersed in the bundles. The bundles were innervated by nerve elements of Auerbach's plexus and extended into both layers of smooth muscle, between muscle cells, and into septa. The bundles were closely associated with elastin fibers. The organization shown in this study strongly supports the concept of interstitial cells of Cajal as important regulatory cells also in the human small intestine. The characteristic cytology and organization of interstitial cells of Cajal may provide a basis for future morphological, electrophysiological, and pathological studies of these cells in human small intestine.\r"

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared, and antibodies to HBsAg appeared 10 months before transplantation. Liver tests showed no abnormality at transplantation. Six months later, chronic hepatitis reactivated, antibodies to HBsAg disappeared, and HBsAg reappeared. Hepatitis B virus DNA was demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction in the serum collected before transplantation. This observation suggests that low level HBV replication was present before transplantation despite the absence of detectable HBsAg and was reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation.\r"

This study presents a patient with clinical resolution of the Budd-Chiari syndrome after placement of expandable metallic stents in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A 26-year-old man with severe ascites and lower extremity edema but with relatively preserved hepatic function had a small gradient across a suprahepatic caval web, large gradients across an intrahepatic caval stenosis and the left hepatic vein, and an occluded right hepatic vein. Under angiographic control, web and caval stenosis were balloon-dilated, and modified Gianturco expandable metallic stents were placed in the intrahepatic vena cava. The left hepatic vein was dilated twice and a stent was placed. All gradients were completely eliminated. There were no complications and after 1 year, the stents have fully expanded without migration, edema and ascites have resolved, hepatic function has normalized, and the patient has returned to work. This new technique provides a simple, safe, effective, relatively inexpensive, and potentially long-lasting treatment for selected patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "91192543\r", 
  ".W": "The molecular and biophysical characterization of Ca2+ channels in smooth muscle has lagged behind that in cardiac and skeletal muscles. This is caused by the difficulties in isolating viable cells and applying electrophysiological techniques to smooth muscle cells. The heterogeneity of smooth muscle cells from different organs also adds to the complexity. In spite of these problems there has been an increasing number of reports on Ca2+ channels in smooth muscle. This review provides an overview of this area. As in skeletal muscles, L (long-acting) and T (transient) voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are found in smooth muscle; the former is better characterized. L channel is regulated by voltage, Ca2+, cyclic nucleotides, and protein kinase C. Ca2+ also influxes through receptor-operated channels that are voltage insensitive. The receptor-operated and T channels are insensitive to dihydropyridine. Clinically, Ca2+ blockers are extensively used for diseases of the cardiovascular system, with more limited use in the gastrointestinal tract. Further understanding of the properties of Ca2+ channels could lead to development of selective Ca2+ channel blockers for the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

There was no correlation between endoscopic and histological gastritis in contrast to a significant correlation for duodenitis. Helicobacter-like organisms occurred in the body or antrum in 81 (31%). Their presence was associated with gastritis--in particular acute and acute on chronic gastritis rather than chronic gastritis.

All patients (58 with chronic atrophic gastritis and 66 with gastric ulcer) had intestinal metaplasia at the start of the study. In the six year period to 1988 a total of 241 biopsies were performed on the patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and 243 on the patients with gastric ulcer. Initially, 81% of the patients with chronic atrophic gastritis presented with type I intestinal metaplasia and 14% with type III intestinal metaplasia. During follow up type I was predominant, often associated with grades 2 and 3 active disease (81%) and 45% of these patients reverted to a non-intestinal metaplasia status by the third year of follow up. In contrast, type III metaplasia was more common in the absence of appreciable inflammation (78% of biopsy specimens), being persistent in five of seven patients in the third year of follow up, and was found to be associated with dysplasia in three of these patients. Similarly, the initial biopsy specimen showed type I metaplasia in most patients with gastric ulcer (82%) and type III in only 4%. Type I metaplasia was also predominant in these patients (80%), particularly in active disease (68%), gradually regressing with healing. In contrast, type III was associated with delayed ulcer healing and reactivation (75%; six of eight patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The development of gastric dysplasia and neoplasia in patients with pernicious anaemia has been evaluated in a prospective clinical and endoscopic follow up study. After initial screening of 80 patients between 1978 and 1980, one patient underwent total gastrectomy for a gastric malignancy and 12 were kept under surveillance and underwent endoscopy at a mean interval of 14 months. In the remaining 67 patients further investigation was attempted six to seven years after the initial investigation. The continuous follow up study identified carcinoids in one patient and an adenoma with severe dysplasia in a further patient. The grade and site of mucosal dysplasia differed from one investigation to the next, but no overall progression was observed. Of the 79 patients, eight had died by the time of the reinvestigation, two of unknown cause and six of causes unrelated to pernicious anaemia. In 38 of the remaining 71 patients, clinical data only were available, with no evidence of new gastric malignancy. In 27 patients it was possible to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, when no change in the degree of dysplasia was detected. In six patients no follow up information was obtainable. In conclusion, patients with pernicious anaemia should be investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy soon after diagnosis. Polyps should be removed wherever possible. In the presence of severe mucosal dysplasia or polyps that are not removed, frequent reinvestigation should be performed, provided the patient is eligible for gastric surgery. In the remaining patients, follow up endoscopies at about five year intervals would seem sufficient.\r"

This study examines the influence of different dosages of shock waves on the gall bladder in both humans and an animal model. Sixty one guinea pigs were divided into groups and subjected to different numbers of shock waves (6,000, 24,000, and 48,000) at different frequencies (2.5, 5.0, 10, 20 shock waves per second) and sacrificed at different intervals. Soft tissue damage after lithotripsy seemed to be related to the number of shock waves administered. In addition, repeated administration of low dose lithotripsy (at weekly intervals for six weeks) did not seem to produce a cumulative injury. Finally, in the animals sacrificed one month after receiving high dose lithotripsy, no soft tissue damage was evident, indicating satisfactory healing. Thirty patients were subjected to either high dose (36,000 shock waves) or low dose (6,000 shock waves) lithotripsy 24 hours before elective cholecystectomy. Both macroscopic and microscopic evidence of soft tissue injury were detected in a significantly higher percentage of patients who received a high dose in a single treatment (p less than 0.05). The group who received repeated low dose lithotripsy showed no evidence of cumulative injury. We conclude that low dose lithotripsy produces minimal soft tissue injury and is safe when repeated up to six times at weekly intervals.\r"

  ".W": "This study analysed clinical features and laboratory investigations in 145 patients with tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed by peritoneoscopy at this hospital between 1984 and 1988. Tuberculous peritonitis was found in 2% of all patients with tuberculosis and in 59.8% of all those with abdominal tuberculosis admitted to the hospital during the study period. Tuberculous peritonitis was more common in women than men (1.4:1) and was most frequently encountered in the third and fourth decades of life. The commonest presenting symptoms were abdominal swelling (73.1%), fever and night sweats (53.8%), anorexia (46.9%), weight loss (44.1%), and abdominal pain (35.9%). The mean duration of symptoms was 1.5 months. Ascites was the commonest (95.2%) physical sign. Tuberculin skin testing was positive in 57.6% of patients (n = 118). The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm/1st hour (n = 58). Chest radiography on 98 patients showed pleuropulmonary pathology in 40 patients (40.8%). Sputum examination confirmed active pulmonary tuberculosis in 26 patients. The ascitic fluid was an exudate in 96.4% and a transudate in 3.6% of patients, with 91.3% showing a straw coloured ascites. Cirrhosis, detected by biopsy specimen, was a finding in 6.2% of patients.\r"

Successful diet induced remission was achieved in 96 of 113 patients (85%) regardless of age, sex, site or severity of disease, or associated complications of strictures, fistula, or perianal disease. Treatment was unsuccessful in 17 patients (15%), but there were no features at the outset of treatment that distinguished these patients from those who had successful remission. The longterm outcome of treatment was assessed over a five year period by analysis of life tables and survival curves. Twenty two per cent of the patients relapsed within six months of treatment and thereafter the annual relapse rate was 8-10%. Patients with disease complicated by fistula or perianal involvement had early relapse, approaching 100% for the latter. A further retrospective comparison of longterm outcome of diet v steroid induced remissions showed no significant difference in the relapse rates between the two groups at one, three, and five years.\r"

  ".W": "This study aimed to assess the role of oxygen free radicals in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by infusion of the CCK-analogue cerulein (5 micrograms/kg per hour) for 30 minutes, 3.5 hours, and 12 hours. After the infusion, serum enzymes and conjugated tissue dienes and malondialdehyde were measured and tissue samples were subjected to electron and light microscopy. Electron microscopy after 30 minutes showed moderate intracellular alterations. After 3.5 hours of cerulein infusion interstitial oedema and intravascular margination of granulocytes in the pancreatic gland were seen. After 12 hours histological evaluation showed pronounced zymogen degranulation, extensive tissue necrosis, and migration of granulocytes into the tissue. Amylase and lipase activities increased 15 and 35-fold respectively during this time. After 30 minutes of cerulein infusion conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde increased, they reached their peak after 3.5 hours and decreased to normal values after 12 hours. Treatment with superoxide dismutase (100,000 U/kg/hour) and catalase (400,000 U/kg/hour) either before or after the start of the cerulein infusion prevented lipid peroxidation and reduced zymogen degranulation and tissue necrosis. Tissue oedema and inflammatory response, however, were not affected in any of the treated rats. Oxygen free radicals are instrumental in the development of acute pancreatitis. Even after its onset, scavenger treatment reduced the tissue damage normally observed.\r"

A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia.\r"

A recent survey by the British Society of Gastroenterology has shown that almost half the district general hospitals questioned did not have a sphincterotomy service available locally. To assess the level of provision required, two investigations have been undertaken. Firstly, an epidemiological study of bile duct obstruction has been carried out in the South Western Region. Secondly, the actual surgical and endoscopic workload in treating obstructive jaundice has been analysed in two health districts. Using present incidence and treatment rates at least 50 ERCPs per 100,000 of the population per year are estimated to be required in the future. Surgical treatment rates can be expected to fall as the number of therapeutic ERCPs increases. The implications of this estimate in equipment and staffing terms are discussed.\r"

Using jejunal brush border membrane vesicles prepared from conventional jejunal biopsy specimens, initial sodium uptake under H+ gradient conditions was found to be only 6% of the mean control value. In contrast, sodium stimulated glucose uptake was normal. Our data confirm the importance of a congenital defect in this exchanger as a cause of severe sodium-losing diarrhoea and extend the spectrum of disorders characterised by a specific defect in brush border membrane Na+/H+ exchange to include some forms of lethal familial protracted diarrhoea.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that oesophageal peristalsis can be modified voluntarily was explored. Six healthy male volunteers and eight female patients with angina like chest pain underwent oesophageal manometry. Each was asked to take a series of swallows, and to vary their size, in random order, by taking either a big gulp or a little swallow. None of the subjects experienced difficulty in doing so. In both groups the amplitude of oesophageal contractions were significantly greater after big gulps than little swallows (p less than 0.01) and this was true for wet (82.0 v 68.9 mmHg) and dry swallows (52.3 v 43.3 mmHg). For the patients' wet swallows the mean values were 73.0 and 56.0 mmHg. Thus, the amplitude of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. This effect may account for some of the within subject variation in the amplitude of oesophageal contractions. During oesophageal manometry subjects should be encouraged to standardise the size of their swallows whenever possible. Patients with symptoms related to abnormal oesophageal peristalsis such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain may benefit from biofeedback training.\r"

Currently available glass electrodes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their size and price. We have thus constructed and tested a small, combined ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) pH electrode incorporating an integral reference electrode. In vitro studies showed that both ISFET and glass electrodes (440-M4, Ingold, Switzerland) have a linear response over the pH range 1.3-8.0 and that they are comparable with regard to response time and 24 hour drift. Twenty one hour intragastric pH recordings were performed simultaneously in eight healthy volunteers using a glass electrode and an ISFET electrode, placed no more than 2 mm apart in a combined assembly. This was located in the gastric corpus under fluoroscopic control. The 21 hour pH curves recorded by each electrode type showed identical patterns: an early morning rise in pH with three meal-associated pH peaks lasting for about two to three hours. The means of the 21 hour pH medians were 2.09 and 2.07 as measured by the glass and the ISFET electrodes respectively. Thus, ISFETs are suitable for the construction of inexpensive and hence disposable multichannel pH monitoring assemblies of small diameter. Provided that they can be produced in large numbers with appropriate technical support, ISFETs have the potential to replace glass electrodes for long term monitoring of gastrointestinal luminal acidity.\r"

Objective tests including solid meal gastric emptying studies, gastric acid secretion, E-HIDA scintiscan for enterogastric bile reflux, and hydrogen breath studies were carried out in all patients and validated against control data. Gastroscopy and biopsy were carried out in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients only. Non-ulcer dyspepsia patients were categorised on the basis of predominant symptoms as: dysmotility-like dyspepsia (n = 22); essential dyspepsia (n = 14), gastro-oesophageal reflux-like dyspepsia (n = 11); and ulcer-like dyspepsia (n = 3). In the total non-ulcer dyspepsia population, solid meal gastric emptying was delayed (T50 mean (SEM) = 102 (6) minutes (patients) v 64 (6) minutes (controls), (p less than 0.01) and high incidences of gastritis (n = 26) and Helicobacter pyloridis infection (n = 18) were found. An inverse correlation was observed between solid meal gastric emptying and fasting peak acid output (r = -0.4; p less than 0.01). Indeed gastric emptying was particularly prolonged in eight patients (T50 mean (SEM) = 139 (15) minutes) with hypochlorhydria. In the non-ulcer dyspepsia population oral to caecal transit time of a solid meal was delayed (mean SEM = 302 (14) minutes (patients) v 244 (12) minutes (controls) (p less than 0.01]. Seven patients had a dual peak of breath hydrogen suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. No association was observed between symptoms and any of the objective abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 190 patients with confirmed ulcers were randomised to continue or stop NSAID treatment. All patients in addition received ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Patients were endoscopically monitored at four, eight, and 12 weeks. Gastric ulcers at eight weeks had healed in 63% of those taking NSAIDs compared with 95% of those who had stopped NSAID treatment. For duodenal ulcer the healing rates at eight weeks were 84% in the group continuing NSAIDs compared with 100% in those who stopped NSAIDs. The differences in healing rates were statistically significant for both gastric ulcer (p = 0.001) and for duodenal ulcer (p = 0.006). At 12 weeks, 79% of gastric ulcers and 92% of duodenal ulcers were healed in the group continuing with NSAIDs. All patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers who stopped taking NSAIDs were healed at 12 weeks. The study shows that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily effectively heals NSAID associated peptic ulcers. Healing is more successful when NSAID treatment stops but even if these drugs are continued, substantial healing rates are achievable.\r"

The present studies have investigated the effect on the stomach to caecum transit time of a baked bean meal of the ileal infusion of 20 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM acetic, butyric, hexenoic, and caprylic acids in rats. After an 18 hour fast either a control or a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) solution (pH 6.5) was infused into the ileum for 30 minutes (0.3 ml/hour). A test meal was given by gavage and the infusion continued for a further 150 minutes. The arrival of the meal in the colon was signalled by a rise in the exhaled hydrogen concentration. Acetic acid (20 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM), butyric acid (100 mM), and caprylic acid (100 mM) produced a significant acceleration of transit which was inversely proportional to SCFA chain length. In a separate experiment, infusion of 100 mM acetic acid, the most potent SCFA, into an isolated ileal Thirty-Vella loop failed to accelerate transit of the test meal. Our results suggest that SCFAs accelerate transit via a local enteric reflex.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of sulphasalazine and olsalazine on jejunal and ileal water and electrolyte absorption was investigated in normal subjects by a steady state intestinal perfusion of a physiological glucose bicarbonate electrolyte solution in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of each drug. (Olsalazine 0.25 g/l, 1.0 g/l, jejunum; 0.5 g/l, 1.0 g/l, ileum; sulphasalazine 0.25 g/l, 0.5 g/l, 2.0 g/l jejunum; 1.0 g/l, 2.0 g/l, ileum.) In the jejunum olsalazine at 1.0 g/l significantly inhibited water, sodium, chloride, and potassium absorption (p less than 0.05). In the ileum olsalazine at 0.5 and 1 g/l significantly inhibited glucose uptake (p less than 0.04) and water absorption (p less than 0.03). In the jejunum sulphasalazine had a dose related and significant inhibitory effect on water, bicarbonate, and sodium absorption and at 2.0 g/l an inhibitory effect on chloride, potassium (p less than 0.005), and glucose (p less than 0.05) absorption. In the ileum sulphasalazine had no significant effect on water and electrolyte absorption. All inhibitory effects were rapidly reversible. These data show that unexplained diarrhoea in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with olsalazine may occur as a consequence of inhibition of water and electrolyte absorption in the small intestine and that the mechanisms of inhibition of sulphasalazine and olsalazine are different.\r"

We therefore investigated the expression of laminin binding proteins in isolated basolateral cell membranes of human colorectal carcinomas and the adjacent normal colonic mucosa. Cell membrane binding assays and immunoblotting experiments showed appreciable quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression of these proteins in neoplastic and normal tissue. Epithelial basolateral cell membranes of colorectal carcinomas bound five to eight times more radioactive labelled laminin than basolateral cell membranes of the adjacent normal colonic epithelium. The expression of laminin binding proteins with Mr 66,000-69,000 daltons corresponding to the so called 'Mr 67,000 dalton laminin receptor' was three to four times higher in colorectal carcinomas than in normal colonic epithelium. In addition, laminin binding proteins with higher molecular weights, which may be related to the family of integrins, were also increased in colorectal carcinomas. In particular, laminin binding proteins with Mr 180,000 daltons were exclusively expressed on neoplastic epithelial cells of human colorectal carcinomas. Our data suggest that certain classes of laminin binding proteins may be selectively expressed on colonic tumour cells, leading to an increased capacity for migration, invasion, and metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Blood group antigen expression in the distal human colon is related to the development of the organ and is modified by malignant transformation. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these changes, we have (a) analysed the activity of glycosyltransferases coded for by the H, Se, Le, X, and A genes, in tissue biopsy specimens from normal and malignant proximal and distal human colon; (b) characterised the glycosphingolipids expressed in the various regions of normal and malignant colon by immunostaining of high performance thin layer chromatography plates; and (c) located the antigens on tissue sections from the same subjects by immunohistochemistry. In both secretors and non-secretors we found a significantly higher activity of alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases in carcinomatous rectal tissue than in tissue from normal subjects, whereas the other transferase activities studied showed no significant differences. The acceptor substrate specificity suggested that both the Se and the H gene dependent alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases are increased in carcinomas. In non-malignant tissue the only enzyme which showed appreciably higher activity in caecum than in rectum was alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase. Immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry showed alpha-2-L-fucosylated structures in normal caecum from secretors and in tumour tissue from both secretors and non-secretors. We conclude that the alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases control the expression of ABH, and Lewis(b) structures in normal and malignant colon.\r"

During a mean histological follow up of 3.7 years, active cirrhosis developed in 21 (20%) patients one to 13 years after entry to the study with a calculated annual incidence of 5.9%. The probability of evolution to cirrhosis was significantly higher in patients with chronic active hepatitis and bridging hepatic necrosis than in those with moderate chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis (p less than 0.0001). Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the following three variables independently implied poor prognosis: older age, presence of bridging hepatic necrosis, and persistence of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum (p less than 0.0001). These findings indicate that patients with severe chronic active hepatitis and persistent hepatitis B virus replication are at very high risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis.\r"

The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without truncal vagotomy was followed by a higher increase (48%) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with truncal vagotomy (13%). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without truncal vagotomy, whereas truncal vagotomy inhibited this increase. These results suggest that truncal vagotomy will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans.\r"

Its concentration in chronic renal failure was also measured. Plasma beta endorphin was not significantly raised in cirrhotic patients with or without ascites (medians 5.2 pmol/l and 4.7 pmol/l respectively) compared with disease control subjects (4.9 pmol/l) and healthy control subjects (4.9 pmol/l). In contrast, the peptide was increased 2.5 fold (p less than 0.001) in chronic renal failure (12.4 pmol/l) and was found in many of these patients' urine. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that the liver may play an important role in the elimination of opioid peptides of octapeptide size or less but not the larger peptides such as beta endorphin.\r"

With each machine, corresponding stones of 45 pairs of weight and volume matched calculi (median volume 0.5 cm3, median diameter 10.5 mm) obtained at cholecystectomy were treated. All stones were successfully disintegrated (fragments smaller than 2 mm) with up to 5400 (median 628) shocks with the Piezolith and 3450 (median 428) shocks with the MPL 9000 lithotripters. With the Piezolith, operating at the highest power setting, a 1.65 fold median higher number of shocks was required for stone fragmentation than with the MPL 9000 at a medium power setting. Stone volume seemed to be the only determinant which affected ease of fragmentation; composition and density of the stones as assessed by computed tomography did not seem to be governing factors.\r"

The prevalence rose with age, except in women of 40-49 years, so that at 60-69 years, 22.4% of women and 11.5% of men had gall stones or had undergone cholecystectomy. The cholecystectomy rate of people with gall stone disease was higher in women than in men (43.5% v 24%, p less than 0.05). Very few subjects with gall stones had convincing biliary symptoms. In women, 10.4% had symptoms according to a questionnaire definition of biliary pain and 6.3% according to conventional history taking, while no men at all admitted to biliary pain. Nevertheless, cholecystectomy in men had nearly always been preceded by convincing biliary symptoms. The age at cholecystectomy was, on average, nine years less than the age at detection of silent gall stones in both sexes. It is concluded that either gall stones are especially prone to cause symptoms in younger people or that there are two kinds of cholelithiasis - symptomatic and silent. The lack of symptomatic gall stones in cross sectional surveys is probably due to their rapid diagnosis and treatment.\r"

In the patients, significantly lower values of faecal chymotrypsin were obtained (mean (SD) 2.4 1.79 U/g stool) whereas in urban control subjects, values were within the normal range (mean (SD) 13.2 (11.9)). In rural black control subjects, however, the faecal chymotrypsin value was significantly lower (mean (SD) 7.1 (5.1)) than in urban black control subjects. It is suggested that faecal pH may influence faecal chymotrypsin values. The mean faecal pH in rural black subjects (pH 6.14) was significantly lower than that in urban control subjects (pH 6.77) and in patients with chronic pancreatitis (pH 6.61). Moreover, mean faecal chymotrypsin is high (20.0 U/g stool) at a pH greater than 7. Between pH 6 and 7 the mean value drops to 8.6 U/g stool and below pH 6 mean faecal chymotrypsin is in the abnormal range (4.4 U/g stool). Hence, low values for faecal chymotrypsin may be due to lower faecal pH (less than 6) in healthy control subjects. For diagnostic purposes, the faecal pH value should be determined if a low faecal chymotrypsin value is obtained.\r"

The prognosis for patients with tetraploid stemlines was intermediate and was poorest for patients with no stemlines in the diploid-tetraploid region. From those parameters assessed postoperatively, only the tumour stage added appreciable information on prognosis to the preoperative quantitative DNA content obtainable. Therefore, in patients with pancreatic cancer the quantitative DNA content should be taken into account in planning treatment and assessing prognosis. Furthermore, the quantitative DNA content may have a major role in stratification for further treatment trials.\r"

The T tube was replaced by a balloon catheter and the papilla of Vater was dilatated allowing passage of stone fragments. We conclude that retained bile duct stones can be removed without sphincterotomy or percutaneous extraction by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation. This method should be considered especially in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Human prorenin is the enzymatically inactive biosynthetic precursor of renin. Recent interest has focused on the posttranslational sorting and processing of prorenin to renin since markedly increased levels of circulating prorenin have been associated with both physiological and pathological changes. These observations raise the question of whether prorenin processing may be a regulatory event in renin production in the kidney. In the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, prorenin can be sorted to either of two pathways: 1) the regulated pathway, which is mediated by secretory granules, where a thiol protease resembling cathepsin B processes prorenin to renin by cleavage of the amino terminal 43-amino acid prosegment, which allows exposure of the active site of renin, or 2) the constitutive pathway, which is not regulated and does not involve conversion of prorenin to renin. Studies in which segments of prorenin are modified by site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the prosegment and glycosylation are not required for sorting, although they may influence or participate in sorting, or both. Certain areas in the prosegment are important determinants of enzyme activity and ability to cleave the prosegment. Further structural analysis of prorenin will be useful to assess details of its sorting and processing. In addition, a number of extrarenal tissues such as uterine lining, ovarian theca, corpus luteum, pituitary, and adrenal, express the renin gene. These tissues have different capabilities to sort and process prorenin compared with kidney, and some tissues secrete only prorenin. Whether prorenin-to-renin conversion is necessary to activate these local renin-angiotensin systems is a key issue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Enhanced activity of the angiotensin system in the brain has been implicated as a possible source of the hypertension and the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, as compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rat. This study tested whether these inbred strains of hypertensive and normotensive rats differ in central or peripheral expression of the gene coding for angiotensinogen, the prohormone for the angiotensin peptides. Angiotensinogen messenger RNA was measured in the brain by in situ hybridization and in the liver by Northern blot analysis, using a synthetic oligonucleotide. There was a 28% greater expression of the angiotensinogen gene in the region of the anteroventral hypothalamus, preoptic area, and medial septum of the hypertensive strain. There were no differences between strains in liver angiotensinogen gene expression. These results are consistent with the possibility that enhanced elaboration of the angiotensin prohormone in the brain contributes, in part, to the hypertension or the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.\r"

Displacement curves for [3H]ramiprilat were established on each tissue with the converting enzyme inhibitors, and their potencies were expressed as the concentration that inhibited 50% of the specific [3H]ramiprilat binding. In the plasma, lung, and heart, the order of activities was: ramiprilat greater than enalaprilat greater than captopril greater than ramipril greater than enalapril. This order was different in the kidney (cortex and medulla): ramiprilat greater than enalaprilat greater than ramipril greater than captopril greater than enalapril. For ramiprilat, enalaprilat, and captopril, there were no differences in their respective potencies between tissues or between rat strains. However, the two prodrugs ramipril and enalapril were 10-30 times more active in the kidney than in the other tissues in both groups of rats. This was due to the deesterification of the prodrugs: in the presence of an esterase inhibitor (diethyl nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 microM), the potencies of ramipril in the kidney were not different from that obtained in the lung, which was not affected by the presence of the esterase inhibitor. These results suggest that the variations in the tissue activities of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor are probably not due to differences in tissue affinities of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but depend on the concentration of this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in each tissue.\r"

  ".W": "To establish if the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in retarding progressive diabetic renal injury is due to a specific intrarenal effect of the systemic hypotensive effect, we studied the effect of long-term ramipril treatment on blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein excretion in streptozotocin-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Three weeks after uninephrectomy and induction of diabetes, rats were allocated to three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were given 1% NaCl, whereas group 3 was given water as drinking solution. One week later, groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 mg/kg/day ramipril in their drinking solution, which was continued over a 2-month period. Ramipril produced a blood pressure fall only in water-drinking rats (group 3) despite a similar reduction in plasma and renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity in groups 2 and 3. Salt-loaded rats had a progressive increase in urinary protein excretion over the duration of study. Ramipril treatment prevented an increase in protein excretion only in animals given water and with a reduced systolic blood pressure. Glomerular filtration rate was similar in all three groups. Ramipril treatment improved animal survival independently of a reduction in blood pressure or an effect on proteinuria. Although it is possible that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have specific intrarenal effects reducing progression of diabetic proteinuria, concomitant control of systemic blood pressure appears to be necessary to demonstrate a benefit.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to examine the role of bradykinin in the persistence of the renal vasodilator effect of captopril during angiotensin II receptor blockade. Blood pressure and renal blood flow were monitored in eight groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits. In group 4, captopril alone was administered, and it decreased blood pressure by 14 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 21 +/- 4 ml/min. After a bolus injection and a constant intravenous infusion of the imidazole derivative angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 (group 5), captopril decreased blood pressure by 9 +/- 2 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 8 +/- 1 ml/min (12 +/- 1% change in renal blood flow, p less than 0.05 versus group 4). In the presence of a constant intravenous infusion of saralasin (group 6), captopril decreased blood pressure by 13 +/- 5 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 7 +/- 2 ml/min (17 +/- 5% change in renal blood flow, p less than 0.05 versus group 4). These results did not differ from those in group 5. During a constant intrarenal arterial infusion of a B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist, DArg0, [Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7]-bradykinin (BkA) (group 7), captopril decreased blood pressure by 14 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 10 +/- 4 ml/min. Combined administration of DuP 753 intravenously and BkA intra-arterially (group 8) eliminated the effect of captopril. In group 8, captopril caused insignificant changes in blood pressure and renal blood flow. The results indicate that DuP 753 and saralasin antagonize the renin-angiotensin system to a comparable extent in vivo. Although blockade of the latter system accounted for a significant part of the increase in renal blood flow caused by captopril, the remaining component was contributed by endogenous bradykinin.\r"

We used a selective renin inhibitor (enalkiren, A-64662) to explore the renal and endocrine effects of angiotensin II in healthy men. Each received 90-minute enalkiren infusions at 2-day intervals, on a low (10 mmol, 16 subjects) and high (200 mmol, 12 subjects) salt diet. Plasma renin activity, immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations, inulin, and p-aminohippurate clearance were measured by standard methods. Plasma renin activity fell at 0.1 micrograms/kg, but the threshold for biologic effect was 256 micrograms/kg, where plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration fell, and renal plasma flow rose (p less than 0.01). The maximal renal vascular response (+152 +/- 23 ml/min/1.73 m2) occurred at 512 micrograms/kg (p less than 0.01). Diastolic and mean blood pressure fell modestly but significantly (p less than 0.05). Responses were limited on a high salt diet. We confirm that conventional plasma renin activity measurement is misleading in humans receiving a renin inhibitor. The renal vascular response to renin inhibition in this study appeared to substantially exceed reported responses to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, perhaps reflecting a crucial and relatively inaccessible intrarenal locus.\r"

Intravenous administration of a blocker of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors, SQ29548 (2 mg/kg bolus injection plus 2 mg/kg/hr for 3 hours), reduced from 162 +/- 4 to 144 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 7-14 days after coarctation when plasma renin activity is greatly increased. In contrast, treatment with SQ29548 was without effect on the blood pressure of either normotensive or hypertensive rats (i.e., aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 90-113 days after coarctation, deoxycorticosterone-salt-induced hypertension) having normal or depressed values of plasma renin activity. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SQ29548 in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension was positively correlated with the prevailing plasma renin activity and could not be demonstrated in hypertensive rats pretreated with indomethacin. We attribute the hypotensive effect of SQ29548 to interference with pressor mechanisms that depend on activation of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors and suggest that such prostanoid-mediated mechanisms are operational and contribute to an increase in blood pressure in angiotensin-dependent forms of hypertension. Also prostanoid-mediated vasodepressor mechanisms are operational in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension since the blood pressure of rats pretreated with SQ29548 was increased by the subsequent administration of indomethacin. Accordingly, the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension is influenced by the interplay of prostanoid-mediated pressor and vasodepressor mechanisms.\r"

Treated SHR, WKY, and untreated WKY rats had comparable blood pressures that were less than those of untreated SHR. Treatment altered the dimensions of the superior mesenteric, intermediate-sized, and small arteries of the mesenteric vasculature. In the case of the superior mesenteric artery and intermediate vessels, hydralazine treatment increased the lumen and medial cross-sectional areas of the arteries in WKY rats and slightly decreased both parameters in SHR. Within the small arteries, treatment significantly increased the lumen size in SHR but not WKY rats and had no significant effect on the media of the vessels. Despite the above alterations, the media-to-lumen cross-sectional area ratios remained significantly elevated in SHR over WKY rats in both the treated and control groups of animals within all classes of arteries. The results indicate that there is an inherent increase in the quantity of media surrounding the arteries of SHR when compared with WKY rats that cannot be abolished by normalizing the blood pressure in utero and postnatally with hydralazine treatment. In SHR, such changes persist not only in arteries that exhibit an increase in the media-to-lumen ratio before hypertension but also in the superior mesenteric artery in which an increase in the ratio occurs after hypertension development.\r"

Ascending aortic pressure and flow were recorded in open-chest anesthetized rats, and the systemic arterial compliance was calculated. Intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of Urapidil, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, induced a significant decrease in arterial pressure (-26%, p less than 0.01 and -37%, p less than 0.001 in WKY rats and SHR, respectively) without significant changes in cardiac output. In control conditions, systemic arterial compliance was lower in SHR (3.29 +/- 1.52 microliters/mm Hg) than in WKY rats (4.35 +/- 1.35 microliters/mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Urapidil injection induced significant increases in systemic arterial compliance values in both strains (p less than 0.001). In another set of experiments (15 WKY rats and 15 SHR), the carotid compliance (microliters/mm Hg) was determined from the arterial volume-pressure relation under control conditions, after local incubation with Urapidil, and after total abolition of the vascular smooth muscle by KCN. In WKY rats, the carotid compliance increased markedly after incubation with Urapidil at doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg (+31%, p less than 0.01). A further increase in the carotid compliance was observed after KCN poisoning (+11%, p less than 0.05). In SHR, incubation with Urapidil at doses corresponding to 2 mg/kg were necessary to induce a significant increase in compliance (+38%). At this dosage, there was no further increase in compliance after KCN poisoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dahl salt-sensitive rats rapidly become hypertensive when exposed to a high salt diet, but Dahl salt-resistant rats maintain normal blood pressure on a high salt diet. A defect in baroreceptor afferents is thought to play a key role in the low sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes in Dahl salt-sensitive rats even in the prehypertensive stage during low salt treatment. In the present study, we tested whether differences in rapid resetting ability might contribute to differences in baroreceptor function in Dahl rats. Four groups of rats were tested: salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats on low salt and high salt diets (0.15% and 8.0% NaCl). We compared the rapidly resetting responses of baroreceptors from each group using an in vitro preparation. Rapid resetting was assessed for each aortic baroreceptor (n = 46) by linear fit of the relation of pressure threshold and conditioning mean arterial pressure. Each group had a wide range of resetting ratios (the slope of the resetting relation). Despite higher initial pressure thresholds in salt-sensitive rats on a high salt diet, resetting ratios among the four groups were similar. Thus, the ability of Dahl salt-sensitive baroreceptors to rapidly reset is preserved, despite high dietary salt and a genetic predisposition to dysfunction. The present findings in Dahl rats reinforce the results of recent studies of rapid resetting during spontaneous and renal hypertension, which suggests that the rapid resetting process is remarkably resistant to factors that compromise baroreceptor function.\r"

Forearm venous plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol and norepinephrine were determined at rest and during graded orthostasis in 47 normotensive control subjects and 58 outpatients with essential hypertension. There was no group difference in age. At supine rest as well as during sitting and standing, hypertensive subjects had plasma norepinephrine concentrations similar to those in normotensive control subjects, but plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol concentrations were higher than those in normotensive control subjects. Both groups showed a linear relation between plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol (ordinate) and plasma norepinephrine (abscissa). The resulting regression line was steeper (p less than 0.02) and its ordinate intercept higher (p less than 0.01) in hypertensive than in control subjects. Eleven normotensive and 14 hypertensive subjects were also tested 3 hours after desipramine (1.5 mg/kg orally) was administered to inhibit neuronal norepinephrine reuptake. The drug did not alter plasma norepinephrine, but did reduce plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol and did abolish plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol responses to upright posture in both groups of subjects. The mean plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol concentration observed in the presence of desipramine again was higher in the hypertensive than in the control group (p less than 0.01) and closely agreed, in both groups, with the dihydroxyphenylglycol concentration given by the ordinate intercept of the dihydroxyphenylglycol versus norepinephrine regression line in the absence of desipramine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the cardiovascular mortality rate among men in the lowest decile of body mass (body mass index 21.96 or less) was 50% higher than that of men in the median class (body mass index 26.4-28.8), death rate for noncardiovascular deaths was more than 2 1/2 times higher in men with lean versus median body mass. The pattern was similar among women. Among noncardiovascular causes, striking differences in mortality rates between lean hypertensives and those of average body mass were observed for cirrhotic death (relative risk of 12+ in men and 11+ in women), for nonmalignant respiratory disease in men (relative risk of 7+), for violent death (both sexes), and for malignant neoplasms in men. Prevalence of smoking was almost twice as high in the lowest compared with the median body mass group; among the lean, excess deaths, particularly noncardiovascular deaths, were concentrated among smokers. Thus, male smokers in the lowest decile of body mass constituted only 3% of the study population, but contributed 8% of all deaths, 11% of all noncardiovascular deaths, and 22% of all cirrhotic deaths. A larger proportion of deaths occurred early in follow-up in the lean versus other hypertensives, suggesting occult disease among the lean at baseline. There was no evidence that more severe or treatment-resistant hypertension was present in or could explain excess mortality among the hypertensives with low body mass. The inference from the findings is not that overweight is protective for hypertensives nor that excess risk is due to leanness per se. Rather, a reasonable hypothesis, particularly from findings on specific causes of death, is that excess mortality in lean hypertensives is due to deleterious lifestyles, particularly smoking and excess alcohol intake, contributing to both leanness and risk of death.\r"

A rate of dosage score (a summed ranking of dosages of all drugs taken) of two or more increased significantly with increasing levels of body mass index (BMI) from 37.5% in levels less than 23, 54.9% in levels 23.0-29.9, and 76.4% in levels of 30 or greater (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, gender, arm circumference, and ethnic group, confirmed the independent effect of BMI on dosage score (p less than 0.001). At each level of dosage score, mean blood pressure levels were equivalent at all levels of BMI after adjusting for potential confounders. This indicates that achieved blood pressure level and not BMI itself was the main determinant of the higher dosing regimens prescribed at higher levels of BMI. In representative subgroups, glucose tolerance (n = 372) and hyperinsulinemia (n = 190) were determined and were found to be positively associated with a dosage score of two or more (p less than 0.05) independently of BMI. These effects could not be accounted for by poor compliance or by altered drug absorption or disposition since overnight urinary drug excretion and plasma drug concentrations 2 hours after ingestion, measured in 80 randomly selected patients from the study group, were not different across BMI categories at similar dosages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the total follow-up time of 1,573 patient years, 27 patients suffered at least one fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event and 13 patients died. Using the Cox regression model, the age-adjusted relative hazard rates of systolic pressure at supine rest, at 50 W, at peak work load, and at 50% of peak exercise capacity were significant for total mortality (p less than or equal to 0.01) and for cardiovascular events (p less than or equal to 0.03). Pressure during exercise, however, did not significantly (p = 0.11-0.97) predict the outcome of the patients when age and pressure at rest were taken into account. The results were similar for diastolic pressure. In conclusion, intra-arterial pressures at rest and during submaximal and peak exercise significantly predict mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular events in hypertensive men, independent of age. However, there is no additional prognostic precision of the exercise pressures when age and the rest pressure are taken into account.\r"

  ".W": "The present study in hypertensive men (40-64 years old) with untreated diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg was aimed at investigating whether metoprolol (n = 1,609) given as initial treatment would lower the risk for coronary events (sudden death and myocardial infarction) more effectively than thiazide diuretics (n = 1,625). A substantial part of this study was the metoprolol arm of the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) study. The HAPPHY study was a pooling of the effect of different beta-blockers, mainly metoprolol and atenolol, in which no favorable effect in relative risk was observed for atenolol as compared with diuretics. In the present study, 255 patients suffered definite coronary events during follow-up; 25% of these events were fatal, 39% were acute myocardial infarctions, and 36% were silent myocardial infarctions. The risk for coronary events was significantly lower in patients on metoprolol than in patients on diuretics (111 versus 144 cases, p = 0.001, corresponding to 14.3 versus 18.8 cases/1,000 patient years and a relative risk of 0.76 at the end of the trial; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.98). This difference in risk has potentially important implications for clinical practice because of the large number of hypertensive patients who are at increased risk for coronary events. Because a placebo group, for ethical reasons, could not be included, relative risk can only be expressed in relation to diuretics. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in baseline characteristics, blood pressure during follow-up, or stroke rates. Thus, the difference in risk for coronary events is probably mediated via mechanisms other than blood pressure control. However, present data might suggest that different beta-blockers may have different efficacy in preventing coronary events. The reasons for this possibility are as yet unknown.\r"

In the entire population, the correlation between baseline blood pressure and blood pressure response to both stressors was not significant. Blood pressure reactivity to both stressors was not increased in participants with borderline hypertension (one clinic reading of more than 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic). When subjects were classified according to blood pressure response (below and above the 80th percentile), the hyperreactors to mental and physical stress had normal baseline blood pressure values. The hyperreactors also had clinic-to-home blood pressure differences similar to those of the rest of the population. Participants who had borderline hypertension at age 32 years had significantly elevated blood pressures at ages 5, 8, 12, 21, and 22 years. Those who were hyperreactors at age 32 years had normal blood pressures as children and young adults. Results of the present study lend no support to an association between higher blood pressures and blood pressure hyperreactivity. Study participants in Tecumseh will be recalled for future examinations. The independence of blood pressure levels from blood pressure reactivity offers a unique opportunity to prospectively evaluate their separate effects on cardiovascular morbidity.\r"

By examining the effects of two environmental factors--acute psychoemotional stress and dietary sodium intake--in rats with genetic hypertension, an important influence on central neural mechanisms governing the renal sympathetic neural control of renal function has been demonstrated. Additional studies of the central opioid systems have demonstrated an important role of opioid peptides in modulating the renal functional responses to acute psychoemotional stress. The observed renal functional alterations--antidiuresis, antinatriuresis, and renal vasoconstriction--are known to be capable of contributing to the initiation, development, and maintenance of the hypertensive process.\r"

At rest, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were significantly higher, and the cardiac index was similarly increased in both groups of hypertensive patients, but the cardiac mass index was significantly increased only in the mildly hypertensive group. During isometric exercise, the sympathoadrenal reactivity as well as the pressor and chronotropic responses were similar in normotensive subjects and both groups of hypertensive patients. However, the variations in blood pressure were achieved through totally different hemodynamic mechanisms in normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. In normotensive subjects, the increase in blood pressure could be linked mainly to an increase in cardiac contractility and performance, whereas in either group of hypertensive patients, the increase in blood pressure was mainly associated with an increase in peripheral resistance. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a blunted beta-adrenergic reactivity and a predominance of alpha-adrenergic vascular reactivity in borderline and mildly hypertensive patients. This phenomenon, which appears to be unrelated to age or severity of hypertension, could be an important mechanism underlying the development of hypertension in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Radiotracer measures of norepinephrine overflow to plasma are well suited for studying both human sympathetic nervous system responses to mental stress and sympathetic nervous pathophysiology in human hypertension. With an experimental laboratory stressor (cognitive challenge), we noted a preferential activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow; however, in fainting reactions (\"vasovagal syncope\"), which occur infrequently during the course of central venous catheter placement under local anesthesia, the converse was seen--an almost total withdrawal of cardiac sympathetic activity. In primary human hypertension (particularly in younger patients), a differentiated activation of the sympathetic outflow to the heart and kidneys is present, based on measurements of norepinephrine spillover to plasma. It is uncertain whether this is attributable to behavioral factors and represents a component of the defense reaction. We previously reported overflow of norepinephrine into the cerebrovascular circulation (with high internal jugular venous sampling) in humans. Because this is resistant to ganglion blockade, brain neurons--not the cerebrovascular sympathetics--are the presumed source. In a preliminary study, we found higher rates of norepinephrine spillover into the cerebrovascular circulation in patients with essential hypertension than in healthy subjects, suggesting that an underlying increase in central nervous system norepinephrine turnover may be the basis for the increased sympathetic outflow.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans is regulated in part by arterial baroreceptors. However, although mental stress increases blood pressure, it also increases MSNA. This suggests that baroreceptor control of MSNA is altered during mental stress. In nine healthy men (age range, 20-26 years), we recorded heart rate, blood pressure, and efferent MSNA (peroneal nerve, microneurography) during a 4-minute mental arithmetic task performed both before and during infusion of phenylephrine sufficient to markedly suppress resting MSNA. Before phenylephrine, mental stress significantly increased mean blood pressure (p less than 0.01), heart rate (p less than 0.01), and MSNA (from 18.5 +/- 3.2 to 24.8 +/- 3.5 bursts/min, p less than 0.001). Phenylephrine infusion increased resting mean blood pressure (from 84.0 +/- 2.6 to 90.0 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and decreased resting heart rate (from 65.6 +/- 1.7 to 55.6 +/- 2.0 beats/min, p less than 0.01). Resting MSNA decreased dramatically during phenylephrine (from 18.5 +/- 3.2 to 3.3 +/- 1.3 bursts/min, p less than 0.01). During phenylephrine, mental stress again significantly (p less than 0.01) increased mean blood pressure, heart rate, and MSNA (from 3.1 +/- 1.4 to 10.9 +/- 1.8 bursts/min). The magnitude of stress-induced increases in MSNA and heart rate were comparable before and during phenylephrine infusion despite the greater elevation in diastolic pressure during stress plus phenylephrine. The present study demonstrates that mental stress produces sympathoexcitatory and pressor responses even during sustained stimulation of arterial baroreceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular effects of stress in humans are often assessed by application of physical or emotional stimuli in a laboratory environment. Although this method provides important information, these procedures have several limitations. First, blood pressure and heart rate responses to laboratory stressors are characterized by a limited within-subject reproducibility. Second, there is poor correlation between blood pressure and heart rate responses to different stressors, which implies that individual reaction to stress may be estimated differently according to the test used. Finally, these responses bear only a limited relation to 24-hour or daytime blood pressure variability, that is, they reflect to only a limited extent the tendency of blood pressure to vary during daily activities. If assessed by techniques that allow blood pressure to be continuously recorded for 24 hours in ambulatory subjects, blood pressure variability represents a possible approach to observation of cardiovascular reactivity away from an artificial laboratory environment. However, whether blood pressure variability should be expressed as a percentage or in absolute values is controversial. Furthermore, although naturally occurring stress may markedly increase blood pressure, 24-hour blood pressure variations also depend on factors that are not related to emotional stimuli. Thus, the study of cardiovascular responses to stress in humans encounters several problems, regardless of the method used.\r"

The magnitude and time course of this response are described for a large number of hypertensive subjects in whom the assessments were performed during ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. In nearly all of the subjects, the physician's visit was accompanied by blood pressure and heart rate increases that peaked within 4 minutes and then declined. The response was characterized by a relatively high average value; a large between-subject variability; no relation with patient age, baseline hemodynamic values, and responses to laboratory stressors; and no attenuation with multiple repetition of the physician's visit. On the other hand, the increase in blood pressure was considerably less when blood pressure assessment was made by a nurse than when it was made by a physician; in both instances, a 10-minute wait was associated with marked reduction of the initial response. Thus, the stress inherent in usual blood pressure-measuring procedures is responsible for considerable overestimations of patients' blood pressures. There are means by which this can be minimized, although a residual error is likely to remain in most subjects. Whether the stress-devoid blood pressure is a better prognostic index than the stress-related one remains unknown.\r"
