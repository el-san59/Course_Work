This study examined the effects of discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment on plasma homovanillic acid levels in 23 patients with chronic schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that clinical decompensation would be associated with increased plasma homovanillic acid levels. Plasma homovanillic acid was measured during administration of neuroleptic medication and during a subsequent 6-week drug-free period. Nine patients decompensated during the drug-free period and 14 patients did not. Following drug discontinuation, plasma homovanillic acid concentrations were higher in schizophrenic patients who decompensated than in those who did not. Furthermore, peak plasma homovanillic acid elevation after discontinuation of neuroleptic medication was significantly correlated with peak Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale increase. The data suggest that, in some schizophrenic patients, symptomatic decompensation after discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment is associated with increases in dopamine turnover.\r"

Compared with controls, probands had significantly higher rates of attention-deficit, antisocial, and drug use disorders at follow-up (mean age, 18 years). The present study was an attempt to replicate these findings on an independent sample of 94 hyperactive boys who were seen at the same clinic, compared with 78 normal controls. Assessments were made by clinicians who were blind to group membership. Information was obtained for 90% of the original cohort. As in the previous study, significantly more probands than controls were given ongoing diagnoses of attention-deficit disorder (43% vs 4%), antisocial disorders (32% vs 8%), and drug use disorders (10% vs 1%). Furthermore, the absolute rates of these disorders were comparable for corresponding groups across studies, and the adjusted odds ratios did not differ significantly. As previously, there was no increased risk for affective disorders in the grown hyperactive children. The present study provides a powerful replication of the nature of the young adult outcome of childhood hyperactivity.\r"

Therefore, we investigated aspects of behavior related to OC use that could explain the preventive effect of OC on the onset of RA. In the present case-control study, past pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, and pregnancies with adverse outcome were studied as possible risk factors for RA. Interview information on reproductive variables was obtained from 135 young adult women with confirmed definite or classic RA of recent onset, and from 378 control patients with soft tissue rheumatic disorders or osteoarthritis. All patients had at least 2 years of followup to confirm the consistency of the diagnosis. We found a decreased risk of RA in women who had been pregnant. The risk of RA in women who had ever been pregnant compared with women who had never been pregnant was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.91). The earlier the first pregnancy, the lower the risk of RA. Pregnancy with adverse outcome (i.e., gestation less than 25 weeks) did not substantially change the risk of RA (relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.50-1.07). The protective effect of pregnancy was independent of OC use, the presence of HLA-DR4, or a family history of RA. Immune modulation by female hormonal influences could be an explanation for the results of the present study.\r"

We studied 2 groups of patients with JA having a different disease prognosis and course. The pauciarticular form is usually benign, while the polyarticular disease frequently leads to joint destruction and disability. Persistent pauciarticular disease developed preferentially in patients having HLA-DRw13-Dw18 and DQw6-Dw18, but these antigens did not confer susceptibility in patients whose disease converted to the polyarticular form. HLA-DPw2.1 was an additional susceptibility factor for patients with JA of pauciarticular onset. In the polyarticular form of JA, HLA-DPw3 was the major factor for susceptibility, giving a relative risk of 10.3 (P less than 0.0001). In addition, we found that DRw8.1 and DQw4 were increased, and HLA-DR4 was markedly decreased, in patients with pauciarticular and polyarticular disease. These results indicate that in addition to some shared factors, distinct HLA class II alleles are important in pauciarticular or polyarticular JA. We conclude that typing with oligonucleotide probes may be useful in predicting the outcome in some children with arthritis.\r"

Muramyl dipeptide, as well as lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1 alpha, also enhanced the release of 35S-sulfate-prelabeled glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan from the cell layer, which seems to reflect, at least partially, the increasing degradation of glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan. Five synthetic analogs of muramyl dipeptide known to be adjuvant active or adjuvant inactive were tested for their potential to inhibit synthesis of glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan and to enhance the release of glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan in chondrocytes. The structural dependence of these synthetic analogs on chondrocytes was found to parallel that of immunoadjuvant activity. These results suggest that muramyl dipeptide is a potent mediator of catabolism in chondrocytes.\r"

We therefore investigated whether an IL-1 inhibitor or IL-6 modulates IL-1 biologic activities in human synovial cells and cultured articular cartilage. We found that in the presence of a constant amount of IL-1 beta, stimulation of hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis by the IL-1 inhibitor was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the decrease in sulfated GAG synthesis induced by IL-1 was reversed by the addition of the IL-1 inhibitor. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the production of HA, prostaglandin E2, or collagenase in synovial cells, nor did it affect GAG in organ cultures when tested in the presence or absence of IL-1 beta. Hence, IL-6 was ineffective in modulating IL-1 bioactivities on HA or sulfated GAG synthesis. These results emphasize the importance of IL-1 and IL-1 inhibitor in connective tissue destruction and raise questions concerning the role of IL-6 in this pathogenesis.\r"

All tissue extracts contained substantial concentrations of Ro (SS-A) antigen and could be grouped into 3 categories based on quantitative reactivity in the sandwich ELISA. The 60-kd and 52-kd molecular forms of Ro (SS-A) present in tissue extracts were similar to those described in Wi-L2 extracts, and the 54-kd molecular form of Ro (SS-A) in guinea pig erythrocytes was similar to that found in human erythrocytes. The tissue distribution of the isoforms of Ro (SS-A) was shown by Western immunoblotting to vary in different tissues, and the reactivity to the 60-kd Ro (SS-A) was correlated with the activity seen in the ELISA. Both the 60-kd and 52-kd Ro (SS-A) bands in guinea pig liver extracts were very weak on Western immunoblots, in contrast to the high concentration of Ro (SS-A) antigen in the ELISA. Other data suggest the possible existence of a unique form of Ro (SS-A) in the liver. Guinea pig tissues have 4 Y RNA that are equivalent to the 4 human RNA--hY1, hY3, hY4, and hY5--present in HeLa cells, while guinea pig red blood cells have only one Y RNA, which is equivalent in size to human hY4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We excluded 219 sera showing dark nucleoli and screened for antibodies to Th in the remaining 152 sera by immunoprecipitation of a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract. Fifteen (4.0%) of 371 sera were anti-Th+. Anti-Th antibodies were present in 14 (8.4%) of 167 SSc patients with limited cutaneous involvement, in 1 of 167 with diffuse cutaneous involvement, and in 0 of 37 with SSc overlap syndrome. Among 244 controls with other connective tissue diseases, anti-Th was detected in only 3 patients, all having primary Raynaud's phenomenon of less than 2 years duration. In the subgroup with SSc with limited cutaneous involvement, the 14 anti-Th+ patients had a significantly greater frequency of puffy fingers, small bowel involvement, and hypothyroidism, and a significantly lower frequency of arthralgia and/or arthritis. Their cumulative survival rate from the time of onset of symptoms was lower than that for anti-Th- patients (78% versus 91% at 10 years), primarily due to 3 deaths from pulmonary arterial hypertension (2 from primary pulmonary hypertension and 1 from pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary interstitial fibrosis). Serum anti-Th antibodies are present almost exclusively in patients with SSc with limited cutaneous involvement or in those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon whose disease may evolve to SSc with limited cutaneous involvement, and these antibodies may identify those patients who are at greater risk for reduced survival.\r"

The results showed increased expression of alpha 2(VI) collagen messenger RNA transcripts in the skin of scleroderma patients compared with that in the skin of normal subjects. These findings indicate that alterations in the expression of type VI collagen genes, similar to those previously described for types I and III collagen, are present in the affected skin of SSc patients.

The patient's mother is an asymptomatic carrier of CGD, and her other son (the patient's half-brother) also has CGD. Neither the mother nor the brother has clinical or serologic evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Previous cases of discoid lupus-like skin lesions have been reported both in carriers and in patients with CGD. Our patient represents the first reported case of an individual with convincing clinical, serologic, and pathologic evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. The association between defective host defense mechanisms and autoimmune phenomena has been described previously in patients with Job's syndrome and in patients with B cell and T cell deficiency disorders, including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The relationship between the known leukocyte defects in CGD and the pathogenesis of a lupus-like illness is unclear.\r"

In the fourth patient, urinary histamine levels were elevated. These findings suggest an association between inflammatory arthritis and localized mast cell disease in some individuals. Further studies are needed to determine whether this association represents an independent syndrome or whether mast cell-related disease is secondary to long-term treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in children with mild arthritis.\r"

The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status. However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05). These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself. However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors.\r"

Chondrocyte viability was assessed using fluorescein diacetate staining, and chondron metabolism was investigated using autoradiography. The results suggest that initial changes in the collagen and proteoglycan distribution within the chondron are followed by chondrocyte proliferation to form clusters. These techniques offer the potential to study cell matrix interactions in degenerative osteoarthritis.\r"

Women were examined for radiographic evidence of OA and for bone mass twice, 20-23 years apart (1962-1965 and 1985; 683 subjects with an age range of 55-74 in 1985). Two measures of OA were evaluated: the highest score assigned to any of the 32 wrist/hand joints, and the sum of scores for all wrist/hand joints. After adjustment for age, women who were classified as having OA (by either measure of OA) in 1985 were more likely to have more cortical area at baseline, which indicates greater bone mass. Women who developed OA in the 23-year period were more likely to experience a significantly greater widening of the medullary cavity over time, an indicator of increased bone resorption. Women with increasing levels of OA involvement also had an increased likelihood of greater cortical area loss. We conclude that women who later developed OA were more likely to have higher baseline bone mass than women who did not develop OA, but these women also had a greater likelihood of bone loss over time.\r"

  ".W": "Diverse data link estrogen influences to both the frequency and severity of systemic lupus erythematosus in humans and to murine lupus. A fundamental mechanism of action of estrogen involves the interaction of the hormone with its receptor protein, which is then transformed into the DNA binding form. We measured the concentration of uterine estrogen receptor and its DNA binding in normal BALB/c mice, lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice, and MRL-lpr/lpr mice that had been treated with 1% difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Uterine estrogen receptor levels in 20-week-old mice from the 3 groups were not significantly different. In contrast, DNA binding activity was significantly higher in BALB/c mice (mean +/- SD 775 +/- 100 fmoles/mg of DNA) than in untreated MRL-lpr/lpr mice (80 +/- 16 fmoles/mg of DNA) (P less than 0.001). Treatment with 1% DFMO was associated with an increase in uterine estrogen receptor DNA binding (1,100 +/- 218 fmoles/mg of DNA) in MRL-lpr/lpr mice (P less than 0.001). Polyamine levels were 2-6-fold higher in the uterine tissues of untreated MRL-lpr/lpr mice compared with the BALB/c mice and were significantly reduced by DFMO treatment. Our results link uterine polyamine production to a dysfunction of the estrogen receptors in MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Reduction of the polyamine level by the irreversible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase with DFMO restores estrogen receptor function.\r"

A 17-kd human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) caused a concentration-dependent (0.2-200 ng/ml) suppression of the effects of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in cartilage organ cultures. IRAP inhibited the binding of radiolabeled IL-1 alpha to rabbit articular chondrocytes. Matrix metalloproteinase (collagenase, gelatinase, and stromelysin) and prostanoid production by IL-1-activated rabbit articular chondrocytes was also suppressed by IRAP. These results could have potential significance in the development of a new antiarthritis therapy based on an IRAP.\r"

A soft tissue mass was noted on the right side of his neck, but his head was tilted to the left. Computed tomography scans (with reformatted sagittal and coronal images) of the patient's cervical spine revealed destructive changes of the right lateral masses of C1 and C2 and the clivus, and a well-delineated peridontoid soft tissue mass (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging). After the second episode of right-sided hemiparesis, he underwent transoral surgical exploration, with anterior decompression and odontoidectomy. Histologic examination of the surgical material revealed granulation tissue, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation, consistent with abscess formation with invasion and compression of the spinal cord and bone. This case suggests that nonreducible rotational head tilt to the side opposite the side of lateral mass collapse should raise the suspicion of a possible infection.\r"

The confirmatory tests identified 8 seroconverters (7 women, 1 man); their serum samples were used to study the antibody reactivity by western blot assays to HTLV-I specific antigens (three recombinant proteins spanning the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal env glycoprotein gp46; a recombinant transmembrane protein gp21; a recombinant tax protein; and three gag proteins [p28, p24, and p19]).

  ".W": "A new theory of the development of expertise in medicine is outlined. Contrary to existing views, this theory assumes that expertise is not so much a matter of superior reasoning skills or in-depth knowledge of pathophysiological states as it is based on cognitive structures that describe the features of prototypical or even actual patients. These cognitive structures, referred to as \"illness scripts,\" contain relatively little knowledge about pathophysiological causes of symptoms and complaints but a wealth of clinically relevant information about disease, its consequences, and the context under which illness develops. By contrast, intermediate-level students without clinical experience typically use pathophysiological, causal models of disease when solving problems. The authors review evidence supporting the theory and discuss its implications for the understanding of five phenomena extensively documented in the clinical-reasoning literature: (1) content specificity in diagnostic performance; (2) typical differences in data-gathering techniques between medical students and physicians; (3) difficulties involved in setting standards; (4) a decline in performance on certain measures of clinical reasoning with increasing expertise; and (5) a paradoxical association between errors and longer response times in visual diagnosis.\r"

Descriptor grades were the most commonly used form of grading of medicine clerks, used in 68 of the 101 responding schools; letter grades were used by another 28 of the schools; and four schools used a numerical grading system. Although descriptor grades were most commonly used for grading medicine clerks, there was lack of consistency in their use between schools. The authors discuss the data related to letter grades and descriptor grades across this representative sample of U.S. medical schools.\r"

The group that attended the lecture (n = 27) did not subsequently obtain a greater mean number or frequency of permissions for autopsies than did the control group (n = 26), whose members did not attend, and did not indicate more frequently in the patients' charts that autopsies had been sought. In addition, in the total group of 53 housestaff, five (9.4%) did not write a pronunciation-of-death entry, and 26 (49%) did not obtain permission for a single autopsy during the study period. Future efforts to enhance the appreciation for the autopsy among physicians in training may need to use more sophisticated techniques than a lecture in order to increase housestaff motivation to obtain consent for autopsies.\r"

The annual prevalence of HIV antibodies remained stable over the 5-year period. However, a seroconversion study conducted on 302 subjects consistently attending the same facility showed a continued occurrence of HIV seroconversion, although the incidence declined from 8.9 per 100 person-years in 1985-1987 to 5.3 per 100 person-years in 1987-1989. The cumulative incidence of HIV seropositivity, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier survival technique, was higher in female than in male IVDUs. The findings show that the use of both incidence and prevalence data to monitor the trend of HIV infection allows a better understanding of the current viral spread among IVDUs.\r"

In total, 16,900 individuals were sampled, with an average response rate of 71%. Knowledge about the major routes of infection was generally good during the entire study period. The fear of unverified infection risks and of contact with HIV-infected people decreased during the period studied, but still remained high in 1989. Over the entire period, respondents expressed a strong fear concerning the spread of HIV in the population. Although an increasing percentage of respondents reported altered sexual habits as a result of fear of AIDS, overall sexual behaviour did not change sufficiently to reduce the risk of spread of any sexually transmissible disease. Progress toward knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour aimed at prevention of transmission of infection and unnecessary fear and counteraction of prejudice was most rapid during the middle of the study period when public debate concerning AIDS was at its peak. Knowledge and attitudes did not change during the last year of the study, but, in some respects, reverted to previous levels.\r"

Murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were characterized by their reactivity with the envelope precursor gp160 or the Escherichia coli recombinant DNA products pB1 and pE3 representing the carboxy- and amino-terminal halves of mature envelope gp120. Fine mapping of the MAb determinants was performed using defined 15-mer synthetic peptides spanning the entire envelope gp120 region of HIV-1. One group of MAbs recognizes epitopes (amino acids 304-323) occurring in a small region with variable and conserved amino acid sequences of gp120. These MAbs mediate neutralization of the HIV-1 strain HTLV-IIIB (HIV-1IIIB) which was used for immunization. Nine out of 11 primary HIV-1 isolates were neutralized well or moderately well. In addition, prominent serological reactivity was noted with peptide sequences of strains of various European or American origins, but not with two HIV-1 strains of African origin. The cross-reactivity contrasts with previously described type-specific reactions to other sequences of this region. The reactivity to the short conserved site GPGR with its flanking amino acids may explain the broad sequence cross-reactivity seen with our neutralizing MAbs. Two other MAbs recognize conserved epitopes (amino acids 79-103) situated in the amino-terminal region of gp120. These MAbs did not neutralize HIV-1IIIB.\r"

HIV-1 and HIV-1-infected cells were capable of activating the complement system via the classical and the alternative pathways, respectively. Low concentrations of HIV-1 were able to infect U937 cells more easily in the presence than in the absence of complement. At higher virus concentrations, infectivity was no longer facilitated by the presence of complement. Infection of U937 cells was reduced in the presence of any of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), OKT4a (anti-CD4), OKM1 (anti-CR3), or M522 (anti-CR3). A combination of all three of these MAbs reduced the infection by an even greater amount. These data indicate that complement receptors may be a port of entry for complement-coated HIV-1.\r"

Compared with DNM, seven of them showed remarkable inhibition of HIV-1-induced syncytium formation at significantly low concentrations which were not cytotoxic. Two derivatives were found to markedly reduce the infectious virus yields from cell lines chronically infected with HIV. Analysis of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins showed that the derivatives induced modification of the processing of not only gp120/160 but also the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. The modification of the processing of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 might play an important role in the inhibition of virus replication at a step after the binding of gp120 to CD4. The enhanced anti-HIV activity of DNM derivatives reported here could increase the possibility of non-toxic therapeutic intervention in HIV infections.\r"

Extrapulmonary disease was more common in seropositive than seronegative TB patients (nine out of 17 versus five out of 26; OR 4.7; 95% CL 1.01-23.6); this accounted for most of the excess cases of TB seen in seropositive patients. Mycobacteraemia was demonstrated in two of eight seropositive TB patients but in none of 11 seronegative TB patients. No atypical mycobacteria were isolated. The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for African AIDS did not discriminate well between seropositive and seronegative TB cases. Five out of seven seropositive women with active tuberculosis had delivered children in the preceding 6 months and were lactating, compared with only one out of eight seronegative tuberculous women. An association between recent childbirth, HIV immunosuppression and the development of TB is suggested.\r"

In a stepwise multivariate analysis of the actuarial progression rate we found the number of CD4+ lymphocytes to be the most powerful predictor of progression to AIDS. We found no independent predictive effects associated with any other variable with predictive power: loss of antibody to p24 antigen, anergy, HIV p24 antigenaemia, loss of antibody to p53 (reverse transcriptase), decreased number of CD8+ T cells, loss of antibody to p31, loss of antibody to p17, beta 2-microglobulin level, loss of antibodies to gp41 and p64, or immunoglobulin A level. We have found that our data differ from those obtained in studies in homosexual men in the different prognostic value of those predictive markers.

  ".W": "Homosexual men with symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection displayed a pronounced lymphopaenia with significantly depressed numbers of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells and B cells during the first week of illness. Subsequently, the CD8+ cell counts rose in parallel with numbers of CD3+ cells, atypical lymphocytes and activated (CD38+ and HLA-Dr+) cells to attain maximal levels about a month following onset of illness. In contrast CD4+ and B cell numbers remained low for an extended period of time. Early signs of a host response included a transient appearance of interferon-alpha in the blood and raised levels of neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M). Neither CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio nor beta 2-M resumed completely normal values during a follow-up period of 2 years. These findings shed some light on pathogenetic events during early HIV-1 infection and suggest that the infection, following the acute symptomatic stage, usually enters a stage of chronic active rather than latent infection.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the reasons why up to 80% of all HIV-1 infections in Zaire, but less than 5% in North America and Europe, are acquired through heterosexual transmission, and to assess the impact of HIV-1 infection on a large urban African workforce, we enrolled 7068 male employees, 416 female employees and 4548 female spouses of employees at two large Kinshasa businesses (a textile factory and a commercial bank) in a prospective study of HIV-1 infection. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rate was higher in male employees (5.8%) and their spouses (5.7%) at the bank than among male employees (2.8%) and their spouses (3.3%) at the textile factory. At both businesses HIV-1 seroprevalence was higher among employees in managerial positions (5.0%) than among workers in lower-level positions (3.0%; P less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of male employees, receipt of a transfusion, a history of genital ulcer disease, working at the bank, urethritis, or being divorced or separated were independently associated with HIV-1 infection. During 1987 and 1988, AIDS was the most common cause of death among recently employed workers, accounting for 20 and 24% of all deaths at the textile factory and the commercial bank, respectively. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rate was higher among female workers (7.7%) than among the spouses of male workers (3.9%; P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis of the wives of workers, having an HIV-1-seropositive spouse, receipt of a blood transfusion, or a history of genital ulcer disease were independently associated with HIV-1 infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The major goals of this study were to measure the current prevalence and estimate the annual incidence of HIV-1 infection in young pregnant women from urban Malawi, to identify factors that were associated with HIV-1 infection, and to examine adverse pregnancy outcomes. Four hundred and sixty-one consecutive pregnant women were studied when they presented for prenatal care. The overall seroprevalence for HIV-1 infection in these urban populations was 17.6% (81 out of 461) during early 1989. Based on previous seroprevalence in similar unselected pregnant women, the estimated annual incidence of HIV-1 seroconversion in urban pregnant women ranged from 3 to 4% per annum between 1985 and 1987 and from 7 to 13% between 1987 and 1989. HIV-1 infection was significantly associated with reactive syphilis serology. Reported history of sexually transmitted disease was also correlated with HIV-1 infection but was not statistically significant. Other variables, such as history of transfusion, history of tuberculosis, parity or occupation were not associated with HIV-1 infection. History of spontaneous abortion was significantly associated with reactive syphilis serology, HIV-1 infection and history of sexually transmitted disease. In logistic regression analysis, HIV-1 infection remained the only significant variable that was correlated with spontaneous abortion. This study suggests that HIV-1 infection may play a role in fetal wastage.\r"

Using follow-up data collected through 31 December 1988, the outcome of the first 18 months of zidovudine therapy in these patients has been analysed in terms of efficacy, expressed as survival and as time to development of a new AIDS-defining condition, and in terms of safety, expressed as toxicity. Median survival from time of diagnosis of AIDS was 124 weeks, significantly longer (P less than 0.001, logrank statistic) than the median survival of 44 weeks in historical controls representing AIDS patients prior to the availability of zidovudine therapy. Median survival time from starting zidovudine has not been reached in these patients, while 172 (56%) developed new AIDS-defining conditions, with median time to progression of 48 weeks. Anaemia requiring transfusion was experienced by 155 patients (50%). Significant differences (P less than 0.01, logrank statistic) in survival were found in favour of patients who commenced zidovudine therapy (Dx-zidovudine time) within 12 weeks of diagnosis and had baseline Karnofsky scores greater than or equal to 80, haemoglobin greater than or equal to 11 g/dl, CD4+ cell counts greater than or equal to 50 x 10(6)/l. Therapy-related significant differences (P less than 0.01, logrank statistic) in survival were found in favour of patients with no weight loss and who received the full zidovudine dose (1.2g) during the first 52 weeks of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among the 3916 men who completed both the baseline (1984) and first 6-month follow-up evaluations and were sexually active during the 6 months prior to enrollment, self-reported use of each of 10 classes of recreational drugs in conjunction with sexual activity was analyzed for both cross-sectional and prospective relationships with pattern of sexual behavior using a four-level sexual risk behavior index. At baseline, the proportion of men in the highest risk category (unprotected anal exposures with multiple partners) increased from 36 to 85% when men not using any drugs to men using three or more drugs plus volatile nitrites were examined. In multivariate logistical analyses, volatile nitrite use was significantly associated with failure to maintain or attain lower sexual risk levels after controlling for the effects of age, educational level and numbers of high-risk partners. These results suggest that volatile nitrite use may play an important role in the association between recreational drug use and high-risk sexual behavior among homosexual/bisexual men.\r"

We carried out concurrent neuropsychological testing of HIV-positive subjects screened for drug treatment protocols at a clinical research center and HIV-negative subjects seeking confidential testing. Fifty HIV-negative and 33 HIV-positive subjects who did not admit to use of central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs, more than one drink of alcohol per day, or drug use comprised the final group for analysis. A neuropsychological test battery designed to evaluate verbal memory, motor function, orientation and attention was administered to all subjects. In addition, affective state was assessed with the Beck depression inventory. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated no difference in the performance of the two groups. Only one subtest, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale digit span (forward) reached a level of significant difference (P less than 0.05) by univariate analysis. We conclude that neuropsychometric performance of asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects cannot be distinguished from that of high-risk HIV-negative subjects by a battery of traditional neuropsychological tests.\r"

All subjects were HIV-infected but had no history of AIDS-related infections, and considered clinically asymptomatic. Interviews and sleep questionnaires revealed sleep complaints in nine subjects. Five healthy HIV-seronegative male subjects, with no history of sleep complaints, were also evaluated. Sleep architecture analyses detected that, in comparison to published normative data and to negative controls, there was a significant increase in the total percentage of slow wave sleep (SWS) and an increase in the percentage of SWS in the later sleep cycles. When compared with normative data, an increase in stage 1 shifts, rapid eye movement (REM) periods, and arousals were also observed in the HIV-infected group. Significant decreases in sleep latency, total percentage stage 2 sleep, and average REM durations were also observed in the HIV-infected group compared with normative data. These sleep architecture abnormalities could not be attributed to known sole primary sleep disorders, first night effect, medications, anxiety or depression. This study indicates that sleep disturbances occur early in the course of HIV infection and suggests that the observed alterations of sleep physiology may be a consequence of central nervous system involvement and/or immune defense mobilization in the early phases of HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in cynomolgus macaques leads to severe immunodeficiency with a fatal outcome. In contrast, HIV-2 infects these primates without apparently causing any immunological abnormalities. In this study three cynomolgus monkeys were experimentally infected with HIV-2 strain SBL-K135 and 168 days later challenged with 10-100 animal infectious doses of the closely related SIV strain SM to study protective immunity. At the time of SIV challenge the HIV-2-infected monkeys had neutralizing antibodies against HIV-2, but virus could no longer be recovered from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and no clinical symptoms or decrease in CD4+ lymphocytes were observed. Follow-up for 9 months after challenge with SIV showed that the HIV-2-infected monkeys were protected against SIV-induced immunodeficiency (no decrease of CD4+ lymphocytes) and lymphadenopathy. However, they were not resistant to SIV infection since virus could be recovered from their PBMCs and they developed anamnestic antibody responses. Four naive control monkeys which were inoculated with the same dose of SIV became persistently infected and developed a decrease of the absolute numbers of CD4+ cells and showed a marked lymphadenopathy. Two out of four control animals died 58-265 days postinfection with an immunosuppressive disease. Immunohistochemical examination showed abundant viral antigen in lymph-node biopsies from the SIV-infected control monkeys but absence of SIV or HIV-2 antigens in the biopsies from the three HIV-2-preinfected and SIV-superinfected monkeys. The present study demonstrates possibilities for induction of immunity against immunodeficiency induced by a primate lentivirus, a concept with application also to HIV infection and AIDS in man.\r"

A linear increase in ADA activity was observed during the second and third months of zidovudine treatment, with a final increase of about threefold after 3 months of drug administration. The concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was significantly lower in the erythrocytes of the same group of patients with respect to healthy controls, and a further decrease was noted after 3 months of zidovudine treatment. The results obtained indicate that treatment of ARC/AIDS subjects with zidovudine induces metabolic changes which could be responsible for the development of anaemia, an adverse effect frequently associated with zidovudine therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The introduction of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of hypertensive disorders and provided an effective alternative for the management of congestive heart failure (CHF). By interfering with the formation of angiotensin II, the active agent of the renin system, ACE inhibitors block the system's vasoconstrictive and sodium-retaining effects, with a consequent reduction in systemic blood pressure. The net effect is improved blood flow and reduced cardiac work. Thus, ACE inhibitors are likely to improve cardiac work capacity and quality of life. Their mechanism of action differs markedly from that of traditional antihypertensive agents which lower blood pressure while reducing cardiac output and blood flow. Since the primary action of ACE inhibitors is to block the renin system, a dramatic response to monotherapy suggests a large renin factor while the lack of a response suggests a low-renin state more amenable to treatment with a diuretic or calcium antagonist. Because of their many attributes, ACE inhibitors are increasingly used as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension or CHF. The prototype orally active ACE inhibitor, captopril, is a sulfhydryl compound with a good safety profile at the recommended dosages but reported toxicity at higher dosages. Second-generation ACE inhibitors (eg, enalapril and quinapril) are more potent sulfhydryl-free esters with a greater affinity for the converting enzyme. These newer agents are pro-drugs requiring ester hydrolysis to form the active free acid compound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Accumulating data indicate that tissue and systemic renin-angiotensin systems may coexist. Evidence supporting the existence of local regulatory systems derives from several sources. Firstly, it has been clearly demonstrated that all components of the renin-angiotensin system are detectable in the tissues of organs such as the brain, heart, lung, kidney, testis, and blood vessels. Secondly, many diverse actions of angiotensin II have been defined in different tissues, all of which have a common mechanism: maintaining or increasing vascular tone, blood volume, or both. Evidence supporting the concept that the local and systemic renin-angiotensin systems are functionally independent includes the discrepancy in the time courses of hemodynamic changes and enzyme inhibition following administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; and the observation that ACE inhibitor treatment results in decreases in blood pressure in anephric subjects, who have extremely low circulating concentrations of angiotensin II. These and other data suggest that inhibition of tissue ACE may be as, or more, important than its effects on the more easily measured circulating ACE. This raises the question of whether there are differences among ACE inhibitors in their selectivity for one or more organ systems. Some experimental data indicate that the binding affinity and time course of ACE inhibition can vary from one tissue to another, and among individual agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Renal dysfunction and hypertension are closely associated. Hypertension causes approximately 25% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and develops in virtually every patient with advanced renal insufficiency from any cause. Although normalization of blood pressure can reduce mortality from uremia and ameliorate the progression of renal impairment in patients with established renal insufficiency from hypertension and diabetes, antihypertensive therapy alone is not totally effective in preventing progressive compromise of renal function--especially in blacks and diabetics, who are at high risk for developing ESRD. Of particular promise is the rapidly increasing understanding of the intrarenal autocrine and paracrine functions of angiotensin II produced locally by a tissue renin-angiotensin system. Consistent and convincing experimental data have demonstrated that angiotensin II plays many roles in the control of renal function and the kidney's response to injury. The intrarenal effects of angiotensin II include: 1) increase in the efferent arteriolar tone, resulting in increased glomerular capillary pressure, 2) promotion of mesangial cell contraction, 3) stimulation of proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption, and 4) possible growth hormone effects leading to hypertrophy or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle. Because of their favorable intrarenal hemodynamic effects (particularly reduction of glomerular capillary pressure), ACE inhibitors may provide a renal protective effect in addition to their systemic antihypertensive effects. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of renal insufficiency in hypertensives and diabetics are currently under way. Favorable results could lead to a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.\r"

Observations with earlier ACE inhibitors led to reports that this class of drugs was relatively ineffective in older hypertensive patients. To ascertain the role of quinapril (greater than or equal to 10 mg/day) in older patients, its blood pressure-lowering effects in 1,175 hypertensive patients less than or equal to 65 years of age were compared with those in 304 patients greater than 65 years of age. An excellent response was observed in patients greater than 65 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic BP, 95 to 105 mm Hg) and moderate to severe hypertension (diastolic BP, 106 to 115 mm Hg). The reductions in blood pressure achieved with quinapril were at least comparable to those obtained in the younger hypertensives, and were numerically (but not statistically) greater in the mild to moderate group (-14 mm Hg v-12 mm Hg). In addition, the percentage of patients who experienced adverse experiences was lower in the greater than 65 group than in the less than or equal to 65 group (15% v 19%). The main adverse experiences reported included dizziness, headache, cough, fatigue, and hypotension. These findings indicate that quinapril is at least as safe and effective in older hypertensives as in younger patients.\r"

Their beneficial acute and chronic hemodynamic effects are not associated with reflex tachycardia or drug tolerance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce symptomatic improvement and improve exercise capacity in all grades of heart failure. They also improve the prognosis of patients with severe heart failure. Quinapril is a recently introduced, nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, whose intermediate half-life makes it well-suited for the treatment of patients with CHF. The acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of quinapril are similar to those of other ACE inhibitors. In a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 225 patients with mild to moderate CHF, 10 to 40 mg/day quinapril significantly improved clinical status and exercise capacity in a dose-related manner. The incidence of side effects did not differ significantly from that of placebo. The initial studies with quinapril are promising and warrant further clinical investigation of this compound.\r"

Hypertensives had higher fasting serum insulin (27 +/- 6 v 12 +/- 2 microU/mL; P = .02) and plasma norepinephrine (356 +/- 38 v 235 +/- 35 pg/mL; P = .03) concentrations than normotensives. Glucose load increased serum insulin (P less than .001) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (P = .001) in both groups and hypertensives had still higher postglucose insulin (P = .003) and norepinephrine levels (P = .003) than normotensives. Fasting neuropeptide Y was higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (P = .03) and correlated with age in both groups (r = 0.7; r = 0.77). Postglucose serum insulin correlated positively with plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.75; P = .013) in normotensives, but these parameters correlated negatively in hypertensives (r = -0.7; P = .036). We hypothesize that elevated plasma norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y levels reflect an increased level of sympathetic nervous activity in hypertensives, which in turn may be responsible for the abnormal relationship between plasma NE and insulin levels.\r"

DOCA and salt rapidly induced severe hypertensive vascular lesions, including necrotizing arteriolitis and productive endarteritis. In these rats, considerable deposits of IgG and IgM were found in the small arteries and arterioles of the kidneys. These deposits were accompanied by complement (C3), and could be eluted by acid incubation. They were localized in periodic acid-Schiff-positive insudative lesions, which were thought to be an early phase of the hypertensive vascular lesions. These results suggest that the immunoglobulins might be bound to an unknown antigen in the vascular lesions and that some immunological mechanism mediated by the immunoglobulins is involved in the development of vascular lesions in severe hypertension.\r"

Evolution of body weight, systolic blood pressure (BP), plasma calcium and magnesium was monitored from 4 to 23 weeks of age. Total cardiovascular reactivity and contractile response of isolated aorta to norepinephrine were measured at 23 weeks of age. LH rats on HCa diet failed to develop hypertension (BP less than 150 mm Hg) whereas LH rats on LCa diet exhibited higher blood pressure levels than their controls fed the NCa diet. Moreover, in LN rats HCa diet slightly decreased BP whereas LCa had no effect. In the LL rats, on the contrary, only LCa diet slightly increased BP. In vivo responsiveness to NE was significantly higher in LH compared to LL and LN rats fed a NCa diet. HCa and LCa diets both induced a significant decrease in this response in LH rats. HCa diet increased the response in LN rats but decreased it in LL. In contrast, at the same age, the in vitro contractile response of isolated aorta to NE was significantly decreased in LH compared to LN and LL rats receiving NCa diet. Moreover in LH and LN rats on HCa diet the contractile response was markedly increased but no significant difference was observed with LCa diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The differences between sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension were theoretically considered using a water tank model of body fluid volume-blood pressure regulation. If an outlet valve is attached to a tank with a base area corresponding to the reciprocal of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and water is poured into this tank at a rate corresponding to the amount of Na+ intake, then equilibrium should be achieved at a certain water level, volume and output from the outlet, which represent mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and urinary Na+ excretion. The height of the outlet from the tank bottom and the size cross-sectional area, of the outlet correspond to the x-intercept and slope of the renal function (pressure-natriuresis) curve, respectively. In both nonsodium sensitive hypertension, due to the shift of the curve toward a higher blood pressure level (elevated height of the outlet) without change in the slope (size of the outlet), and sodium sensitive hypertension, due to the depressed slope of the curve (reduced outlet size), not only MAP (water level) but also CO (water volume) are increased, resulting in sodium retaining hypertension, if TPR (reciprocal of base area) remained unchanged, while CO is relatively unchanged, resulting in nonsodium retaining hypertension, if TPR is elevated. Thus, the MAP and its sensitivity to sodium intake is determined by the renal function curve. Since body fluid volume is determined by both the renal function curve and TPR, however, changes in TPR during the development of hypertension is a major factor in determining whether or not the body fluid volume has to change only a small amount or a large amount. Therefore, the sodium sensitivity of blood pressure and sodium retention must be considered separately.\r"

In perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 on endogenous norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness during nerve stimulation. Endogenous norepinephrine release and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 inhibited the stimulation-induced norepinephrine release and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of these suppressive responses were more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. Calcium removal from extracellular fluid also reduced the norepinephrine release more strongly in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that the regulation of norepinephrine release might be more dependent on protein kinase C and calcium in the blood vessels of SHR, which could contribute, at least partially, to the pathogenesis of this form of hypertension.\r"

PKC activity was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of P47 protein (the endogenous substrate of PKC in the platelet). Mean effective concentration (EC50) values for phorbol ester and synthetic diacylglycerol (direct activators of PKC) were similar in SHR and WKY, thus revealing similar intrinsic activity of PKC in both rat strains. EC50 values for thrombin were approximately 30% lower in SHR v WKY. Enhanced PKC activity in SHR is likely the result of an increased diacylglycerol formation and release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools, consequent to an increased thrombin-induced phospholipase C activity.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions.\r"

  ".W": "The concept that the kidney plays a major role in the long-term control of arterial pressure is based on the pressure-natriuretic response. According to this hypothesis, hypertension can only develop when the relationship between sodium excretion and arterial pressure is altered. Transplantation studies have indicated that some form of renal dysfunction underlies the development of genetic forms of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and in the Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat. Nonetheless, the factors responsible for \"resetting the kidney in hypertension\" remain unknown. We have reported that the pressure-natriuretic relationships of SHR and Dahl S rats of the Brookhaven and Rapp strains are shifted toward higher pressures prior to the development of the disease. Papillary blood flow is also reduced in very young \"prehypertensive\" SHR. Recent studies on the mechanism of pressure-diuresis indicate that it is mediated by inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and/or thin descending limb of Henle of deep nephrons. It is also associated with changes in renal interstitial pressure and the pressure and flow in the vasa recta circulation. These observations suggest that an elevation in renal medullary vascular resistance may be responsible for shifting the pressure-natriuresis relationship toward higher pressures in hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91084575\r", 
  ".W": "Anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) monoclonal antibody NMC-4 completely inhibited vWF binding to platelet glycoprotein (GP) lb induced by either ristocetin or botrocetin at an IgG concentration of approximately 10 micrograms/mL, and also blocked binding of asialo-vWF to GP lb. NMC-4 coupled beads isolated a 97-Kd fragment (Fr) from a whole tryptic digest of vWF. The N-terminal sequencing of the nonreduced 97-Kd Fr, in combination with amino acid analysis, showed it to be a homodimer of residues 449 through 728 of the constituent subunit. Present data, together with the results obtained from previous studies, confirm the existence of one or three possible inter-subunit disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 459, 462, and 464. NMC-4 bound to reduced vWF Fr(s) more weakly than to nonreduced Fr(s), but it did not react with Fr III-T2 of vWF, a disulfide-linked twin heterodimer of residues 273 through 511 and 674 through 728 (Marti et al, Biochemistry 26:8099, 1987). Fr III-T2 completely inhibited ristocetin-induced vWF binding at a concentration of 100 mumol/L but had no effect on botrocetin-induced binding. In addition, both the N- and C-terminal polypeptides, residues 449 through 549 and 674 through 728, generated by subdigestion of the 52/48-Kd Fr (Fujimura et al, J Biol Chem 261:381, 1986), inhibited preferentially ristocetin-induced vWF binding without affecting to botrocetin-induced vWF binding. These findings suggest that amino acid residues 512 through 673 of the vWF subunit are involved in botrocetin-induced vWF binding.\r"

  ".W": "A novel platelet glycoprotein has been purified and characterized. This glycoprotein, designated Pltgp40, is an acidic sialylated 40,000-dalton protein that bears both O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides. Treatment of Pltgp40 with neuraminidase resulted in a 5,000-dalton reduction in its Mr and a 1.5 Unit alkaline shift in the isoelectric point, indicating the presence of a large number of sialic acid residues. A similar size reduction and change in pl were observed after treatment of Pltgp40 with O-glycanase showing that sialic acids are present on O-linked oligosaccharides. Digestion of Pltgp40 with N-glycanase reduced the Mr to approximately 20,000 daltons but did not affect the isoelectric point, suggesting that Pltgp40 contains six to seven nonsialylated N-linked carbohydrate chains. High Mr proteins were observed in affinity purified Pltgp40 and were identified as detergent-stable protein oligomers consisting of multiple 40,000-dalton monomers. Immunodepletion and direct binding studies indicated that Pltgp40 was not equivalent to Ig Fc receptor type II, another 40,000-dalton glycoprotein expressed on platelets. However, Pltgp40 copurified with Fc receptor type II when platelet extracts were loaded onto human IgG affinity columns, raising the possibility that Pltgp40 may associate with Fc receptors or Fc receptor-lg complexes. Amino acid sequence analysis of the N-terminus of Pltgp40 was performed and confirmed that Pltgp40 is a novel platelet glycoprotein. Epitopes on Pltgp40 appear to be widely expressed because monoclonal antibodies against Pltgp40 also reacted with a variety of myeloid, lymphoid, and epithelial cells. Pltgp40 was detected on activated but not resting platelets, indicating that Pltgp40 is a platelet activation marker.\r"

  ".W": "The steady-state expression of three members of the myb family of genes, c-myb, B-myb, and A-myb, was studied in four purified normal human hematopoietic cell types, ie, T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. The c-myb proto-oncogene is low to undetectable in resting T and B lymphocytes and shows a biphasic induction in both cell types after mitogenic stimulation, with a first peak at 3 hours and a second and stronger induction at 44 to 72 hours. Study of the B-myb gene showed that this gene is low to undetectable in resting T or B cells and is strongly induced after mitogenic stimulation with a peak between 44 and 72 hours in both cell types. Finally, the A-myb gene shows a pattern of expression in lymphocytes different from that of c-myb and B-myb. It is expressed in resting T lymphocytes and its levels gradually decrease after mitogenic stimulation to become undetectable at 48 hours. It is also expressed in a subpopulation of large B lymphocytes but not in in vitro activated B cells. Neither of the three members of the myb family of genes was expressed in monocytes and granulocytes, even after functional activation of these cells. Taken together, these data bring further evidence for the role of c-myb in cellular proliferation and on the basis of the kinetics of its induction relative to thymidine uptake, we hypothesize that it may have a role during G1 progression in addition to that already documented for entry into S phase. Furthermore, our studies indicate that another member of the myb family of genes, B-myb, may also be involved in cellular proliferation, because its expression correlates with the induction of mitogenesis.\r"

We examined the changes in the deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive sites within the 5' end of the MPO gene and its 5' flanking region during dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to determine the changes in chromatin structure that accompany this process. The locations of hypersensitive sites surrounding the 5' end of the gene in proliferating, uninduced cells were determined: three were observed in the 5' flanking region and one within the gene. Progressive changes in all sites accompanied the downregulation of MPO transcription after treatment with DMSO. No evidence of hypersensitivity was observed in the chromatin region examined after 8 days of DMSO exposure. The results provide an example of the changes that occur in the chromatin structure of a gene as it is inactivated during differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "91084581\r", 
  ".W": "While varying degrees of spectrin deficiency have been found in the majority of patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), a combined severe deficiency of both spectrin and the spectrin-binding protein, ankyrin, has been reported only in two patients with severe HS. To elucidate the molecular basis of these protein deficiencies, we have studied the synthesis, assembly, and the mRNA levels of spectrin and ankyrin in peripheral blood reticulocytes in one of the previously reported probands. Pulse-labeling studies showed that in HS reticulocytes, the synthesis of alpha-spectrin was comparable with control reticulocytes while that of beta-spectrin was increased about fourfold, presumably reflecting increased erythropoietic drive. On the HS reticulocyte membrane, the amount of newly assembled spectrin was reduced to about half of the control values, presumably reflecting a decrease in the synthesis of the spectrin binding protein, ankyrin: the ankyrin synthesis was nearly absent in the cytosol and the amounts of membrane-associated ankyrin were reduced to about half of the normal values. The changes in the amounts of spectrin and ankyrin mRNAs quantitated by slot blot and Northern blot analyses were comparable with changes in the synthesis of these proteins: The alpha spectrin mRNA was within a control range and the beta-spectrin mRNA was slightly increased, while the amounts of ankyrin mRNA were reduced to about 50% of control values. We conclude that the primary defect underlying the combined spectrin and ankyrin deficiency is a deficiency of ankyrin mRNA leading to a reduced synthesis of ankyrin which, in turn, underlies the decreased assembly of spectrin on the membrane.\r"

From a random sampling of 250 sickle cell (SS) patients and 125 normal adults, 17 individuals representing the highest and lowest HbF producers were selected for study. All three common restriction fragment length polymorphism beta-globin region haplotypes (Benin, Central African Republic, and Senegal) were found in both the highest and lowest HbF producers with SS disease. Using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA product, we examined the promoter regions of both the A gamma and G gamma genes from -350 bp to +50 bp of the CAP site. No mutations were found in either gamma gene promoter region. We conclude that nucleotide substitutions in the promoter regions (-350 to +50 bp) of both gamma genes are not responsible for the marked variation in HbF production among SS or normal individuals.\r"

The introduction of an extra amino acid residue and of other changes in the crevice where the heme group is located is the likely cause of the instability of this hemoglobin variant. The above listed changes were detected through analyses of tryptic peptides of the beta-Montreal chain, sequencing of amplified DNA, and hybridization of amplified DNA with appropriate, 32P-labeled, oligonucleotide probes. It is suggested that a mispairing involving the AGTG sequences at codons 66 and 67 and at codons 72 and 73 of the normal beta gene caused a repetition of a 16-bp segment, while a deletion of 10 nucleotides due to recombination or slippage followed by a second short deletion during DNA repair resulted in the modified sequence of the beta-Montreal gene.\r"

  ".W": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was induced across the murine major histocompatibility complex by injecting C57BL/6 (H-2b) bone marrow and splenocytes into lethally irradiated B10.BR (H-2k) murine recipients. An immunotoxin (IT) composed of a pan T-cell monoclonal antibody called anti-Ly1 (the murine homologue to human anti-CD5) was conjugated to ricin toxin A chain (anti-Ly1-RTA) and used to treat recipient mice. In vitro, IT was as active as free RTA, bound selectively, and inhibited T-cell proliferation even in the absence of potentiators. Mice administered anti-Ly1-RTA in vivo during ongoing GVHD, at a dose of 10 micrograms/d for 5 days, showed lower numbers of splenic Thy1.2+ T cells and significantly improved survival as compared with mice given phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or irrelevant control RTA IT. Protection was transient because GVHD and weight loss occurred when injections ceased. Survival could not be enhanced by crosslinking RTA30, a low oligosaccharide-containing fraction of purified RTA. Treatment with anti-Ly1-RTA caused a significant elevation in neutrophils, and higher doses were associated with mild hepatotoxicity. In contrast, infusion of identical doses and schedules of another pan T-cell immunotoxin, anti-Thy1.2-RTA, caused a significant decrease in lymphocytes, but not neutrophils; a precipitous increase in weight; a decrease in total plasma protein (TPP); and an increase in pleural and peritoneal effusions reminiscent of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). Although the toxic effects of anti-Thy1.2-RTA were too severe to show a survival advantage in a GVHD model, histopathologic studies showed a definite anti-GVHD effect. The most significant decline in GVHD as compared with the PBS-treated controls was observed in skin, and to a lesser extent, in liver and lung. To investigate the cause of IT toxicity, anti-Thy1.2-RTA was administered intraperitoneally to lethally irradiated B10.BR (H-2k) recipients of syngeneic bone marrow. These recipients showed the same weight gain, hypoproteinuria, and VLS observed in the GVHD model. Death occurred at higher anti-Thy1.2-RTA doses (30 or 50 micrograms/daily injections administered days 8 through 12 posttransplant). Anti-Thy1.2-RTA had a negligible effect on renal function, but histologic studies showed patchy dropout of the renal tubules. Treatment resulted in pulmonary vascular congestion, but there was no pathologic evidence of liver, brain, or colon toxicity. Weight gain was enhanced by irradiation because nonirradiated normal mice did not undergo such a precipitous weight increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

After transplant, one patient had serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation whereas three patients had evidence of an immune response to HBV. Among four patients with serologic follow-up of 1 year or more, three remained positive for HBsAg and one became HBsAg negative. Six patients (30%) developed clinical evidence of venocclusive disease and seven patients (35%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease involving the liver, but the incidence of these complications was similar to that expected among patients who are not carriers of HBsAg. Three patients died with hepatorenal failure, but all three had venocclusive disease and the contribution of HBV infection to liver failure was unclear. Available liver specimens obtained at autopsy (six patients) or biopsy (two patients) all showed either HBsAg (one specimen) or hepatitis B core antigen (four specimens) or both (three specimens) by immunoperoxidase staining. Although HBV reactivation leading to hepatic failure has been reported among allogeneic marrow transplant recipients as well as other immunocompromised patients, we did not observe an increase in the incidence of severe liver disease after transplant among these 20 patients positive for HBsAg at the time of transplant, and do not consider positivity for HBsAg to be a contraindication to allogeneic marrow transplantation.\r"

All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration. Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose. At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Compared with conventional transfusion regimes a strong reduction in HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions is obtained when both red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) are depleted of leukocytes by filtration. Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration.\r"

Sixty-eight patients (58%) underwent medical treatment and/or splenectomy and 33 (48% of treated) achieved a complete stable remission. At equivalent platelet count the incidence of major hemorrhagic complications was significantly higher in aged (greater than 60 years) than in younger (less than 40 years) patients (10.4% v 0.4%/pt-y, relative risk = 28.9, P less than .01). A previous hemorrhagic event was identified as another major risk factor for hemorrhage (relative risk = 27.5, P less than .0005), while hypertension and underlying disorders had no influence. We conclude that age more than 60 years and a previous history of bleeding are major risk factors for severe hemorrhages in adults with ITP.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo effects of interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and a combination of IL-3 plus IL-6 on murine megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis were examined. Human recombinant IL-6 was administered subcutaneously as 14 equal injections of 5,000 units each during a 102-hour period. Murine recombinant IL-3 was given as 8 injections of 80,000 units each during the first 54 hours. Megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis were evaluated 120 hours after initial administration of the cytokines. Platelet levels increased by 20% following IL-3 alone, 35% following IL-6 alone and 61% after administration of both IL-3 and IL-6. Platelet production, as measured by 75Se-selenomethionine incorporation, increased by approximately 120% in animals that had received IL-6 or IL-3 plus IL-6. Megakaryocyte ploidy analysis by two-color flow cytometry showed a shift in the modal ploidy class from 16N to 32N and a significant increase in the frequency of 64N cells only in IL-6 treated animals. Both bone marrow and splenic megakaryocyte colony-forming cells were significantly increased following either IL-3 or IL-6. Bone marrow megakaryocyte size increased 18%, 43%, and 38%, respectively, after administration of IL-3, IL-6, or the combination of IL-3 plus IL-6. Leukocyte counts and hematocrits were unaffected by either cytokine. Additional groups of mice received the same injection schedule as above and the serial effects on peripheral blood cell levels were assessed for 30 days. Platelet levels, which had been elevated by IL-3 or IL-6, fell to control values within 4 days following the last injection. Animals given IL-6 or IL-3 plus IL-6 were subsequently thrombocytopenic relative to controls on days 7 through 9 following cessation of treatment. Temporary 'cycling' of platelet levels was observed for 3 weeks following treatment with IL-6 or the combination of IL-3 plus IL-6. We conclude that IL-6 and to a lesser extent IL-3 stimulate platelet production in vivo and that their combined effects on platelet levels are approximately additive. Following discontinuation of IL-3 or IL-6, the effects are rapidly reversed, presumably by negative feedback mechanisms, resulting in a period of 'rebound thrombocytopenia' in mice that had received IL-6.\r"

IL-6 was administered subcutaneously to Swiss Webster mice, followed by evaluation of bone marrow megakaryocyte ploidy, size and frequency, and median platelet volume 24, 48, and 72 hours after the initiation of IL-6 administration. In addition, bone marrow megakaryocyte morphology was examined using electron microscopy at 72 hours. IL-6 (10,000 U per subcutaneous injection) was administered three times during the first 24 hours, three times during the second 24 hours, and twice during the last 24-hour period. IL-6 bioactivity (10 U/ng) was determined using the IL-6-dependent murine hybridoma cell line B9. Megakaryocyte ploidy distribution, measured by two-color flow cytometry, demonstrated a shift in the modal ploidy class from 16N to 32N and a significant increase in the relative frequency of 64N megakaryocytes 48 and 72 hours (but not 24 hours) after initiation of IL-6 administration (cumulative doses of 60,000 and 80,000 U at 48 and 72 hours, respectively). In addition, ploidy levels were increased in animals that received a cumulative IL-6 dose of only 40,000 U (evaluated after 72 hours). The size of recognizable bone marrow megakaryocytes, determined by the cross-sectional areas of plastic embedded bone marrow megakaryocytes, was increased at the 48-hour (60,000 U IL-6) and 72-hour (80,000 U IL-6) time points. Megakaryocyte frequency, measured by flow cytometry, was unaffected at all time points and doses of IL-6. Median platelet volume, measured by electrical impedance, was not consistently altered by administration of IL-6. Electron microscopic examination of bone marrow megakaryocytes showed an increase in the proportion of megakaryocytes with a wide, peripheral, organelle-deficient zone from 20% +/- 9% (SD) in control animals to 50% +/- 7% (SD) (P less than .02) in animals that received IL-6. No changes were observed in the distribution of the demarcation membranes. IL-6 is a potent stimulator of murine megakaryocytopoiesis, in vivo, and appears to act early in megakaryocyte differentiation.\r"

Meanwhile, supernatants from human thymic stroma could promote the proliferation of myeloid stem cells. Thus, we investigated whether IL-3 accounts for this activity. Therefore, human thymic epithelial cells (TEC), fibroblasts, and adherent cells were isolated, and their culture supernatants assayed for myeloid colony promotion. Only supernatants from thymic epithelial cells supported colony-forming unit growth in semisolid media. This effect decreased following anti-IL-3 monoclonal antibody addition to these cultures. Furthermore, in situ hybridization showed the presence of IL-3 mRNA in epithelial cells. Effect of TEC culture conditions on IL-3 production by these cells was also studied. Together, these data show that IL-3 production is not the exclusive property of human activated T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91084598\r", 
  ".W": "Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare, inherited disorder of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) complex. We previously identified two distinct populations with this disorder in Israel, Iraqi-Jews and Arabs. The groups are indistinguishable in hemorrhagic symptoms and platelet GP IIB/IIIa receptor deficiency, but they differ in their platelet immunodetectable GP IIIa (beta 3), with the Iraqi-Jewish population expressing no detectable GP IIIa and the Arab population expressing small amounts. We have now examined the platelets of these two populations as well as normal platelets for the alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor. Normal platelets contained between approximately 50 to 100 alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptors as judged by the binding of antibodies to both alpha v (LM142) and the intact alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor complex (LM609). In addition, normal platelets bound to immobilized vitronectin in the presence of 1 mmol/LMnCl2; the adhesion was mediated predominantly through GP IIb/IIIa, but with a distinct contribution by the alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor, as determined by monoclonal antibody inhibition studies. Iraqi-Jewish patients' platelets had a profound decrease in immunodetectable alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptors, and their platelets did not adhere well to vitronectin. In contrast, Arab patients' platelets had normal or increased numbers of platelet alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptors, and these receptors functioned well in the vitronectin adhesion assay, taking over much of the adhesion mediated by GP IIb/IIIa in normal platelets. These studies define further the heterogeneity of the molecular basis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia; they also have more widespread implications for understanding the synthesis and function of the beta 3 family of integrin receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified and biochemically characterized an antigen, 8A3, which is expressed on activated T lymphoblasts and activated platelets. Monoclonal antibodies to 8A3 were raised against the primitive lymphoid/myeloid cell line KG1a and additionally bound to the erythroleukemia-derived cell line HEL, whilst exhibiting little or no reactivity with a panel of other hematopoietic cell lines. The 8A3 antigen was expressed on poorly differentiated T-cell leukemias and on phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cells maintained in interleukin-2 (7,000 sites/cell). This antigen, though not detected on resting platelets, was expressed on thrombin-activated platelets (2,000 sites/platelet). Antibodies to 8A3 identified polypeptides of Mr 170,000 and 150,000 in lysates of surface-iodinated KG1a cells, T lymphoblasts, and activated platelets under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. However, peptide mapping and susceptibily to glycosidases indicated that the 8A3 antigen was a monomeric glycoprotein of Mr 170,000 which contained two N-linked endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycans, and that the Mr 150,000 structure was derived from it by proteolytic degradation. The 8A3 antigen was not detectably phosphorylated in KG1a cells in vivo, nor did immune complexes containing it exhibit kinase activity in vitro. Structural and serologic characteristics of the 8A3 antigen indicate that it is different from other previously described leukocyte activation antigens including transferrin receptors, interleukin-2 receptors, members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules, or \"restricted\" members of the leukocyte-common antigen/CD45 cluster. Furthermore, the 8A3 antigen does not appear to be related to the other previously described activation-specific platelet molecule, GMP140/PADGEM. This antibody may be useful in monitoring T-cell activation status in some clinical situations and in characterizing clinically relevant activation-associated platelet membrane alterations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the age related incidence of advanced chronic renal failure in two areas of England. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients newly identified as having advanced chronic renal failure within a two year period; subsequent monitoring of patients' clinical course for a further 26 months. SETTING--Devon and Blackburn. SUBJECTS--Those patients in a population of 708,997 who developed advanced chronic renal failure (serum creatinine concentration greater than 500 mumol/l) for the first time during a two year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--210 Patients (148 per million population per year) developed advanced chronic renal failure, 117 (51%) of whom were over 70. The age related incidence rose from 58 per million per year in those aged 20-49 to 588 per million per year in those aged 80 or over. Only 54% (113) of patients were referred to a nephrologist; 120 patients (57%) needed dialysis or died within three months of presenting without receiving dialysis, and 187 (89%) died or needed dialysis within three years. After those unsuitable for further treatment had been excluded, 78 patients per million population per year aged under 80 needed to start long term renal replacement treatment. CONCLUSIONS--Many patients suitable for renal replacement treatment are still not referred for nephrological opinion and are denied treatment. If the treatment rate in the United Kingdom rose from the 1988 rate of 55.1 per million per year to 78 per million per year then the number of patients receiving treatment would rise to about 800 per million. This is double the present number and has considerable but predictable resource implications for the NHS.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective notification of patients reaching a defined level of advanced chronic renal failure (serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 500 mumol/l or blood urea concentration greater than or equal to 25 mmol/l) within one year and follow up for at least three, and, at most, four years after notification. SETTING--Northern Ireland. PATIENTS--122 Patients with a serum creatinine or blood urea concentration higher than the defined level newly detected from 1 March 1985 to 28 February 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Survival after notification. RESULTS--77 Patients of all ages/million population/year had advanced chronic renal failure compared with 67/million/year between the ages of 5 and 80 found in an earlier study of the same population. 62% Of the patients were older than 50 years. Seventeen (14%) of the patients either required dialysis or died within one month of notification, 51 (42%) survived for at least three months, and 23 (19%) for one year or longer. Three patients, all of whom were attending a renal clinic, survived for periods of 43, 45, and 46 months respectively without renal replacement treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The increased number of new patients disclosed in this survey compared with the earlier survey is mainly owing to an increased number of older patients. Such patients often have disabilities other than renal failure, are less likely to be capable of self treatment, may develop complications more often and require more frequent hospital admissions, and may not be suitable for transplantation and consequently have considerable resource implications for the NHS.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the methods used to investigate children at high risk of congenital hearing impairment, and to see whether the introduction of evoked response audiometry has reduced the mean age at which hearing loss is identified. DESIGN--Clinicians who notified children to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme were asked retrospectively to complete a questionnaire examining the methods used to identify hearing impairment and the age at testing in two consecutive five year cohorts. The presence or absence of hearing loss was confirmed by obtaining the results of audiometric evaluations and, whenever possible, a recent pure tone audiogram. SETTING--The United Kingdom. PATIENTS--Children notified to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme and born in 1978-87 in whom IgM specific for rubella was detected shortly after birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The age at which hearing loss was identified and the degree of loss in decibels at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz measured by pure tone audiometry. RESULTS--61 (52%) Of 117 children born in 1978-82 had a hearing impairment of 40 dB or greater in both ears. The mean loss was 93 dB. In the following five years 75 (47%) of 159 children had impaired hearing, their mean loss being 96 dB. The age at which the hearing loss was confirmed decreased from 11.6 to 9.8 months as a result of earlier auditory evoked response testing. Nevertheless, only eight (13%) of the children with hearing impairment born in 1978-82 and 16 (21%) of those born in 1983-7 had these tests performed in the first six months of life. CONCLUSIONS--Unacceptable delays in identifying hearing loss occurred in this high risk group because of failure to arrange auditory evoked response testing in early infancy. Evoked response audiometry is sensitive and specific and should be undertaken within the first few months of life for all infants known to be at risk of sensorineural hearing loss.\r"

  ".U": "91084629\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine laboratory workload and rates of referral for colposcopy in a three district cervical screening programme during 1983-9 to assess the feasibility of accommodating call up of all women at risk, recall at three year intervals (now five year intervals), and investigation of women with all degrees of abnormality. DESIGN--Analysis of computerised screening histories dating back to 1977 of women screened in the Avon cervical screening programme. SETTING--Three district health authorities covering the population of Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, comprising 800,000 people, of whom 250,000 were female residents aged 20 to 64. SUBJECTS--196,977 Women aged 20 to 64 screened in cervical screening programme since 1983. RESULTS--Laboratory workload devoted to follow up of women with abnormalities increased sharply between 1987-8 and 1988-9, with increases of 54% (from 2075 to 3196) in the number of smears for follow up of severe dyskaryosis and invasive cancer, 40% (from 1925 to 2695) for mild and moderate dyskaryosis, and 49% (from 1793 to 2677) for borderline change. The increases were partly explained by the introduction in April 1988 of protocols for follow up and investigation based on guidance in an intercollegiate working party report. The proportion of women with mild and moderate dyskaryosis who were recommended for referral for colposcopy increased steadily from 9.9% in 1983-4 to 79.9% in 1988-9, and for borderline change the proportions were 3.5% and 13.6% respectively. Of all women tested in 1988-9, referral for colposcopy was recommended in 3%. CONCLUSIONS--The increase in laboratory follow up work identified, if it continued, could result in half of existing laboratory capacity in Avon being devoted to follow up work by 1993, with little prospect of maintaining call, recall, and quality control. Investigation of all women with minor cytological abnormalities is neither justifiable nor sustainable and will undermine the benefits of screening by increasing the rate of false positive results and the financial costs.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective audit of antibiotic prophylaxis by keeping copies of typed notes of operations and annotating them at discharge and at first follow up visit and annual review of prophylactic regimen according to yearly rate of wound infection and modification if necessary. SETTING--The work of one consultant surgeon working in a district general hospital. PATIENTS--All patients having major colorectal resection during 1976-89 (400) and cholecystectomy during 1981-9 (500). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Wound infection, defined as any discharge from the wound as detected by observation during inpatient stay and by specific questioning at the first follow up visit six weeks later. RESULTS--Serial changes in prophylaxis for colorectal surgery resulted in a progressive reduction in the rate of wound infection from 43% in 1976, with no prophylaxis, to 1% during 1986-9 with single intravenous doses of metronidazole and cefuroxime intraoperatively and with lavage of the peritoneal cavity and wound with 0.1% tetracycline. During 1981-7, with no prophylaxis, the rate of infection in biliary surgery was 12% whereas in 1988-9, after the introduction of lavage with tetracycline alone, the rate was reduced to 2%. IMPLICATIONS AND ACTION--Simple prospective audit identified the need for changes in antibiotic prophylaxis; successive rounds of audit resulted in improved rates of wound infection, and lavage with 0.1% tetracycline seemed to be a major factor in achieving this.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To examine how district health authorities organised cervical screening with respect to Department of Health guidelines and to determine their assessment of the problems encountered. DESIGN--Postal questionnaire sent to all 190 district health authorities in England in 1989. PARTICIPANTS--190 District health authorities in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Population coverage of screening, quality of smear testing, and follow up of abdominal test results in comparison with national guidelines for district cervical screening services, and problems encountered by districts. RESULTS--Replies were received from 178 (94%) of districts, in 143 of which the person named as responsible for cervical screening contributed. All districts implemented a computer managed scheme, 150 by the target date of 31 March 1988, but not all of these conformed with the guidelines. At the time of the survey only just over half called women in the target age group of 20-64 and only 70% expected to meet the target date of 13 March 1993 for completing the call. Considerable variation was evident among the schemes with regard to how they dealt with issues related to population coverage, quality of testing, and follow up of abnormal results. The problems most commonly identified by the districts (n = 174) were laboratory workload (107, 61%), computer software (104, 60%), availability of resources (78, 45%), non-attendance (77, 44%), rate of opportunistic screening (62, 36%), and investigation and treatment (60, 34%). CONCLUSIONS--Current practice in running cervical screening schemes needs to be examined to determine the extent to which it contributes to the goal of reducing mortality from cervical cancer.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To characterise the natural history of sexually transmitted HIV-I infection in homosexual and bisexual men. DESIGN--Cohort study. SETTING--San Francisco municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic. PATIENTS--Cohort included 6705 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited from 1978 to 1980 for studies of sexually transmitted hepatitis B. This analysis is of 489 cohort members who were either HIV-I seropositive on entry into the cohort (n = 312) or seroconverted during the study period and had less than or equal to 24 months between the dates of their last seronegative and first seropositive specimens (n = 177). A subset of 442 of these men was examined in 1988 or 1989 or had been reported to have developed AIDS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of clinical signs and symptoms of HIV-I infection, including AIDS, AIDS related complex, asymptomatic generalised lymphadenopathy, and no signs or symptoms of infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Of the 422 men examined in 1988 or 1989 or reported as having AIDS, 341 had been infected from 1977 to 1980; 49% (167) of these men had died of AIDS, 10% (34) were alive with AIDS, 19% (65) had AIDS related complex, 3% (10) had asymptomatic generalised lymphadenopathy, and 19% (34) had no clinical signs or symptoms of HIV-I infection. Cumulative risk of AIDS by duration of HIV-I infection was analysed for all 489 men by the Kaplan-Meier method. Of these 489 men, 226 (46%) had been diagnosed as having AIDS. We estimated that 13% of cohort members will have developed AIDS within five years of seroconversion, 51% within 10 years, and 54% within 11.1 years. CONCLUSION--Our analysis confirming the importance of duration of infection to clinical state and the high risk of AIDS after infection underscores the importance of continuing efforts both to prevent transmission of HIV-I and to develop further treatments to slow or stall the progression of HIV-I infection to AIDS.\r"

SETTING--Combined gastroenterology service, Scarborough Hospital. PATIENTS--108 Consecutive patients identified as having a discrete mass on diagnostic ultrasound examination of the abdomen. INTERVENTION--A sample of tissue was obtained with an aseptic technique under local anaesthesia: an 18 steel wire gauge needle (Tru-Cut) was mounted in a spring loaded firing device (Biopty gun) that was advanced under simultaneous ultrasound scanning, permitting precise localisation of the target organ. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Results of histological examination of tissue specimens. RESULTS--Biopsy failed in four patients. Adequate histological specimens were obtained in 104 patients with masses in the liver (31), pancreas (37), kidney (10), and adrenal glands (six) and in 20 undiagnosed abdominal and retroperitoneal masses. Follow up was until death or confirmation of the diagnosis. Three complications but no deaths occurred. Malignancy was suspected in 84 patients before biopsy. This was confirmed in 70 patients, in 26 of whom confirmation of dissemination obviated the need for further investigation. In 10 patients biopsy indicated a previously unsuspected primary tumour, and in 12 it showed only a benign lesion. Among 24 patients considered to have benign disease biopsy showed an unsuspected neoplasm in seven. Use of biopsy thus had a major effect on clinical management in 55 patients. Four false negative but no false positive diagnoses resulted from the procedure. CONCLUSION--Percutaneous biopsy of abdominal and retroperitoneal masses under ultrasound guidance is a safe and accurate method of obtaining a histological diagnosis. The results obtained have a considerable effect on clinical management.\r"

RESULTS--Senior house officers and preregistration house officers spent nearly half of all their on call duty time working, but less than half of that time was spent in direct contact with patients. Registrars were on call more often than the house officers but spent less than one fifth of their on call duty time working, and almost two thirds of that time was spent in direct contact with patients. CONCLUSIONS--Workload while on duty is excessive for both senior and preregistration house officers. Changes in some administrative procedures and employment of more non-medical staff during on call periods might reduce the time spent on non-clinical activities, thereby reducing the overall workload and allowing more time for patient contact.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective review of the hospital case notes, necropsy reports, and records of the coroners' inquests. SETTING--Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--All 255 children aged less than 16 years who died with a head injury during 1979-86. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cause of injury and circumstances of accident according to reports of inquests; injury severity score; number of fatal accidents and mortality per 100,000 children in 10 groups of local authority wards ranked according to their score on the overall deprivation index; and distance of site of accident from child's home. RESULTS--Of the 255 children who died after a head injury, 136 (53%) children were playing at the time of the accident. 195 (76%) children sustained the head injury in road traffic accidents, 135 as pedestrians, 35 as cyclists, and 25 as passengers in a vehicle. In 120 accidents in child pedestrians the primary cause of accident was the unsafe behaviour of the child. 172 (67%) accidents occurred within one to two km of the child's home and 153 (63%) between 3 pm and 9 pm. The mortality was significantly related to social deprivation; excluding eight children injured while on holiday in the region, 15-fold decrease in mortality was recorded between the local authority wards that ranked highest on the overall deprivation index and those that ranked lowest (14.0/100,000 children, group 10 v 0.9/100,000, group 1 respectively, p less than 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS--The finding that most accidents occurred in children living in deprived areas who were playing unsupervised near their home suggests that childhood mortality might be appreciably reduced if children at play were protected from traffic, particularly in socially deprived areas.\r"

Age, occupation, and marital status exerted minor effects. Subjects attributed fatigue equally to physical and non-physical causes. Physical ill health, including viral infection, was associated with more severe fatigue. Women rather than men blamed family responsibilities for their fatigue. The profile of persistent fatigue did not differ from that of short duration. Only one person met criteria for the chronic fatigue syndrome.

Medical contraindications to donation were found in 23% (32) of 141 patients tested for brain death, in 38% (19) of 50 patients who died while being ventilated who were not tested, and in 12% (11) of 92 patients no longer being ventilated. Consent for donation was sought in 88% (96) of 109 medically suitable brain dead patients and granted in 70% (67) of these. Half those with permission for multiorgan donation had only the kidneys removed. CONCLUSIONS--More organs may be lost owing to transplant team logistics than by failure to seek consent from relatives of brain dead patients. The estimated size of the pool of potential donors depends on what types of patients might be considered. Ensuring that all who die while being ventilated are tested for brain death and considering the potential for donation before withdrawing ventilation could yield more donors. Ventilating more patients who are hopelessly brain damaged to secure more donors raises ethical and economic issues.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assist with educational planning we surveyed health sciences faculty members in 1989 to determine their use of microcomputers, desire for further instruction and perceptions on what microcomputer services should be provided for students. The 1989 results were compared with those of a similar survey performed in 1986. DESIGN: A self-completed, mailed questionnaire, with up to three reminders. SETTING: Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: All full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty members were sent the questionnaire; over 80% of the FT and 65% of the PT faculty members responded in 1986 and in 1989. RESULTS: The proportions of faculty members who used microcomputers increased significantly over the 3 years, from 71% to 87% among FT members (p = 2.2 x 10(-8)) and from 48% to 69% among PT members (p = 4.9 x 10(-8)). There were significant increases in the use of many of the applications, especially database and filing uses (from 10% to 41% among FT members [p less than 1 x 10(-9)] and from 6% to 34% among PT members [p less than 1 x 10(-9)]) and on-line access to bibliographic databases (from 7% to 37% among FT members [p less than 1 x 10(-9)] and from 3% to 18% among PT members [p less than 1 x 10(-9)]. These changes occurred mainly through individual initiative and voluntary continuing education. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary rate of adoption of microcomputers attests to their perceived usefulness. Curriculum planners need to consider how the success of microcomputer applications can be evaluated objectively and how successful applications can be integrated into educational programs.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, multiple crossover trial with three treatment periods, each consisting of 3 weeks of active drug therapy and 3 weeks of placebo administration. SETTING: Referral-based geriatric practice in a community hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-four patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were included if they had stage 3 to 6 disease (as determined by the Reisberg scale) and had not been taking psychotropic drugs for at least 1 month and if informed consent had been obtained from the patients and their next of kin. INTERVENTIONS: Fifty to 100 mg of THA daily and matched placebo. RESULTS: Of the initial 34 patients 14 experienced liver toxicity and 3 gastrointestinal side effects during the study; however, all 22 who completed the study were able to tolerate at least the minimum dose. For the 22 patients there was no clinically or statistically significant effect of THA on cognition, functional status or behaviour. The results for individual patients showed no subgroup of THA-responsive patients. CONCLUSION: THA has no clinically important benefits in Alzheimer's disease and is associated with appreciable toxic effects.\r"

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with chronic airflow limitation participated in a multiple crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The effect of theophylline and salbutamol, alone or combined, on pulmonary function and dyspnea during daily activities was examined. Correlations of changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and maximum expiratory pressures (MIPs) (independent variables) and changes in dyspnea score during daily activities (dependent variable) were also examined. RESULTS: The two drugs proved to be beneficial the effects in general were additive rather than synergistic. The drugs improved the FEV1; theophylline significantly improved the MIPs. The correlation between the changes in FEV1 and those in dyspnea score, after adjustment for the changes in MIPs, was 0.55 (p less than 0.001). The correlation between the changes in MIPs and those in dyspnea score, after adjustment for the changes in FEV1, was 0.39 (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in airway calibre and in respiratory muscle strength play an independent and important role in dyspnea during daily activities in patients with chronic airflow limitation. Changes in airway calibre may be of greater importance.\r"

To help the many elderly housebound people without primary medical care we initiated a medical services home care program. The goals were patient identification, clinical assessment, medical and social stabilization, matching of the housebound patient with a nearby family physician willing and able to provide home care and provision of a backup service to the physician for consultation and help in arranging admission to hospital if necessary. In the program's first 2 years 105 patients were enrolled; the average age was 78.9 years. More than 50% were widowed, single, separated or divorced, over 25% lived alone, and more than 40% had no children living in the city. In almost one-third of the cases there had never been a primary care physician, and in another third the physician refused to do home visits. Before becoming housebound 15% had been seeing only specialists. Each patient had an average of 3.2 active medical problems and was functionally quite dependent. Thirty-five of the patients were surveyed after 1 year: 24 (69%) were still at home, and only 1 (3%) was in a long-term care institution; 83% were satisfied with the care provided, and 79% felt secure that their health needs were being met. One-third of the patients or their families said that it was not easy to reach the physician when necessary. We recommend that programs similar to ours be set up in health jurisdictions with a high proportion of elderly people. To recruit and retain cooperative physicians hospital geriatric services must be willing to provide educational, consultative and administrative support.\r"

Etoposide can be synergistic with other agents. As part of combination chemotherapy, etoposide has become a so-called standard in therapies for testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. Its activity in tumors such as lymphoma and leukemia, as well as solid tumors, identifies etoposide as a highly important chemotherapeutic agent. Cellular and animal models have shown that the cell kill and tumor response depend on both dose and time of exposure. Recent clinical studies again show that dose and schedule of etoposide can have important effects on clinical response to the drug. Further research should now continue: (1) on the use of etoposide as part of initial therapy in several cancers, and (2) in higher doses and prolonged schedules to optimize this agent's potential.\r"

  ".W": "During the past two decades, dramatic strides have been made in the treatment of metastatic testicular cancer. In the early 1970s, cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) produced durable complete remissions (CR) in approximately 70% of treated patients. In the early 1980s, etoposide emerged as the only drug with single-agent activity in cisplatin-refractory patients. Based on preclinical data demonstrating synergy of cisplatin plus etoposide, the two-drug combination proved to be a useful salvage therapy, curing approximately 25% of such patients. Further evaluation of etoposide as part of initial therapy by the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG) compared PVB with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) in previously untreated patients with metastatic germ cell tumors. Not only did BEP have significantly less toxicity, it proved to be superior to PBV in patients with advanced disease. Varying the dose and schedule of etoposide also may provide patients with potentially useful avenues of treatment. High-dose etoposide plus carboplatin in drug-refractory patients has produced durable CR in a cohort of treated patients; it is currently being evaluated as part of initial salvage therapy. The schedule dependency of etoposide in small cell lung cancer led us to evaluate daily oral administration of etoposide in patients refractory to previous etoposide therapy; objective response rates of approximately 15% to 25% were observed. In summary, etoposide remains an integral part of the treatment regimen for testis cancer. However, the incorporation of innovative dose and schedule combinations for etoposide may further improve its therapeutic index for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The epipodophyllotoxin derivatives etoposide and teniposide have been evaluated intermittently for possible use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Conflicting studies suggest that variables such as dose and prior treatment have a major influence on outcome. Response rates ranged from 0% to 40% in five series with teniposide, and from less than a 10% overall response rate to greater than a 10% complete response rate in nine studies with etoposide. One study documented activity with oral etoposide. However, because all patients had received various prior chemotherapies, firm conclusions regarding the activity of etoposide could not be drawn. These results, and the expectation of synergy with etoposide and cisplatin, led to several studies that combined etoposide with platin compounds by the systemic and intraperitoneal (IP) routes. Various studies have used intravenous drug combinations of these agents in both previously treated and untreated patients. One study, which used carboplatin instead of cisplatin, reported only seven failures among 26 previously untreated patients. Conversely, the prominent toxicities reported by another study were discouraging, and responses did not exceed what might be expected from cisplatin alone. Studies of analogous combinations administered IP are ongoing. A favorable experience, which was initially reported by the University of California (San Diego group), is being confirmed by other investigators. This has prompted the incorporation of etoposide into first-line strategies. The pharmacologic advantage of etoposide by the IP route (related to its high protein binding) may provide appropriate dose intensity against IP disease while sparing systemic toxicities. Finally, systemic dose intensity with autologous bone marrow support indicates some promise for etoposide in combination with high-dose alkylating drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Etoposide is a schedule-dependent drug with excellent activity against small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Single-agent etoposide achieves overall response rates ranging from 15% to 84%, depending on the schedule of drug administration and the characteristics of the treated population. The route of etoposide administration (intravenous versus oral) has little impact on response rate, provided appropriate dose adjustments are made for oral therapy. In combination with other active agents, etoposide has proven particularly effective in the management of SCLC. Etoposide can be substituted for doxorubicin or vincristine in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) regimen without loss of efficacy. The etoposide and cisplatin (EP) combination is thought to be synergistic and has proven to be an effective salvage regimen for CAV failures. A regimen that alternates CAV and EP has been found by some investigators to be modestly more effective against SCLC than CAV alone; however, EP alone may be as useful as an alternating regimen. Most studies to date have demonstrated that EP induction is at least as effective as any other standard induction regimen. However, EP has the potential advantage of being more easily integrated with thoracic radiation therapy (RT). This is particularly important in limited-disease patients: two recent pilot studies employing EP induction with hyperfractionated thoracic RT yielded 2-year survival rates of greater than 50%. These promising results are being evaluated further in an ongoing Phase III trial in the United States. The available data indicate that etoposide is one of the most active agents against SCLC and therefore should be included as a component of induction therapy in all patients. New schedules of etoposide administration warrant further study.\r"

Early preclinical work demonstrated sharp activity in mouse leukemias and possible synergy with cisplatin. As a single agent (either orally or intravenously), it demonstrated limited benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with response rates around 10%. In combination with cisplatin, it has become a mainstay of chemotherapeutic efforts, either as primary therapy or in conjunction with radiation. Response rates in advanced disease average around 30%, climbing to more than 50% in patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB disease. More recent work suggests that the issue of the true synergy of etoposide with cisplatin in NSCLC needs reassessment. The relative roles of etoposide and cisplatin in the combination are unclear, as several studies conflict. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that multiple daily fractions of etoposide are superior to prolonged infusions, warranting several future trials. The current major role for etoposide plus cisplatin would appear to be in multimodality therapy where the combination can be readily combined with radiation and/or surgery. Several other agents have been studied with etoposide or etoposide plus cisplatin (mitomycin, vindesine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin), but it is unclear whether the addition of any of them offers any response or survival advantage.\r"

A patient's prognosis depends on the degree of gastric wall penetration, presence of lymph node metastases, and location of the primary site. Metastatic gastric carcinoma is currently incurable. However, chemotherapy continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Active agents include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate, mitomycin, and etoposide. Combination etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (EAP) has been reported to result in encouragingly high response rates, including a 10% complete response rate in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma. Trials are now under way to confirm these results. Similarly, another etoposide-based combination, etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-FU (ELF), has resulted in an equally good response rate but less toxicity than EAP. The 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) regimen, previously reported to have an excellent response rate, is also being investigated further. For patients with locoregional carcinoma, curative resection rate is often unsatisfactorily low; however, curative resection is consistently associated with improved survival (between 23 and 26 months). In patients with potentially resectable carcinoma, two significant problems must be recognized: (1) a low rate of curative resection and (2) the development of widespread carcinoma despite curative resection. Despite many attempts, the postoperative strategies of adjuvant chemotherapy have been ineffective. New strategies must be investigated aggressively. Combination etoposide, 5-FU, and cisplatin (EFP) has been administered preoperatively and postoperatively to patients with resectable gastric carcinoma, resulting in an encouraging curative resection rate (greater than 70%) and manageable toxicity. Based on promising results reported with EAP in patients with unresectable locoregional carcinoma of the stomach, a trial of preoperative and postoperative EAP in potentially resectable carcinoma of the stomach is now under way.\r"

Single-agent trials in which etoposide is administered to heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer have demonstrated a low overall response rate (6.6% of 383 patients), with no convincing evidence for either schedule dependence or a relationship between dose intensity and response. The sole single-agent trial in previously untreated patients suggested that the drug has an approximately 15% response rate in untreated patients. Combination therapy trials in which etoposide has been combined with either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or cisplatin have not yet convincingly demonstrated superiority over any of these drugs as single agents, although cisplatin plus etoposide appears to be superior to either agent alone. In vitro studies suggest that pretreating hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells with estradiol may increase their sensitivity to etoposide-induced DNA cleavage. This may represent a future direction in the use of etoposide in breast cancer. Currently, however, the use of etoposide in breast cancer should be considered investigational.\r"

A growing number of specific protocols include this useful agent in the management of malignant lymphoma, both at the time of primary treatment and at relapse. The broad activity of etoposide across several histologic subtypes of malignant lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease indicates a potential that is only now being fully exploited. Used according to optimal doses and schedules, etoposide has single-agent activity that rivals earlier drugs such as the alkylating agents and doxorubicin. Functioning as a protein synthesis and topoisomerase II inhibitor, it offers the potential for non-cross-resistant cytotoxicity. After a brief comment on the single-agent activity of etoposide, this report will focus on the integration of etoposide into multiagent protocols used in the primary treatment of malignant lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. The specific findings from protocols such as prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide-cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and methotrexate (Pro-MACE-CytaBOM) (US National Cancer Institute [NCI]) and etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (VACOP-B) (Vancouver) for the primary treatment of malignant lymphoma, and vinblastine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and prednisone (VECABOP) (Vancouver) for the treatment of previously untreated patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease will be discussed.\r"

The experience with etoposide in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is less extensive, but the drug seems to be active in combination with cytarabine or aclacinomycin. In addition, etoposide is combined with cytarabine and anthracyclines for the primary treatment of AML. The response rates thus achieved are comparable with those obtained with standard regimens. A Phase I/II trial was initiated to study the efficacy of the NOVE combination (mitoxantrone [10 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 5] plus etoposide [100 mg/m2/d for 3, 4, or 5 days] in patients with refractory AML. The results showed that extended duration of etoposide administration is associated with higher CR rates. Overall, a CR rate of 43% was achieved in 61 patients. A sequential regimen with IDAC (idarubicin/cytarabine) and NOVE was designed for primary treatment of adult patients with AML. Cycles of IDAC or NOVE are applied depending on response. The results of the pilot study with this strategy were encouraging with 18 of 20 patients achieving CR. Further studies are under way to verify the efficacy of this strategy.\r"

If a greater degree of myelosuppression is accepted, higher than standard doses could be given. This approach takes advantage of the steep dose-response relationship for most chemotherapeutic agents, including etoposide, as shown in early in vitro and clinical studies. Thus, etoposide was considered an ideal agent for further dose-escalation studies, given its wide range of clinical antitumor activity at standard doses, steep dose-response curve, mild bone marrow suppression, and few nonmyeloid side effects. The high-dose etoposide studies that followed used improved and more intensive hematologic supportive care, including, in some trials, autologous marrow transplantation. When etoposide was used as a single agent in these high-dose trials, mucositis, and, to a lesser degree, hepatic dysfunction were dose-limiting. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this setting was 2.4 to 3.0 g/m2. Multi-agent Phase I trials with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, carmustine, or carboplatin also resulted in dose-limiting mucosal toxicity, with liver and lung problems appearing more often than with high-dose etoposide alone. The toxicity and MTD can be influenced markedly by the schedule of administration. Etoposide as a continuous intravenous infusion can be given at doses of 4.2 g/m2 (with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) with similar toxicity, but without marrow support. The antitumor results in the lymphomas set the stage for treatment of solid tumors, where treatment of patients with \"sensitive\" relapses had the best outcome. Lymphoma patients had an 80% response rate; overall, long-term (greater than 2 years) disease-free survival was approximately 40%. Germ cell tumors were also responsive, and the same pattern of sensitive relapses and improvement in responding patients was seen (50% to 75% of patients greater than 1 year). In breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), high-dose etoposide-containing regimens were used to intensify standard therapy. The results in these settings were not quite as good (breast cancer, 30% disease-free survival at 2 years; SCLC, 10% at 2 years).\r"

  ".W": "The epipodophyllotoxin derivative etoposide (VP-16) has been in widespread use both alone and in combination chemotherapy for the past decade. It has phase-specific cytotoxicity that acts in the last S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Although its mode of action is not certain, it appears to act by causing breaks in DNA by interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or by the formation of free radicals. Most studies show biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide. Approximately 30% to 70% of administered etoposide is excreted, with approximately 45% present in the urine. Etoposide is available in oral and IV preparations. It is highly schedule-dependent, with once-daily doses (e.g., for 5 to 8 days every 21 days) giving results superior to intermittent administration. The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing dose (e.g., greater than 200 mg/d, bioavailability decreases). Factors influencing the bioavailability of oral etoposide include patient status, concurrent medications, hepatic and renal function, and nausea and vomiting. In numerous clinical trials, etoposide has demonstrated excellent activity against a range of tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), malignant lymphomas, gestational trophoblastic tumors, Ewing's and soft tissue sarcomas, and germ cell tumors, with more modest activity in other tumors (e.g., non-SCLC). Although few comparative studies have been carried out, available data suggest that oral etoposide administered daily during 5 to 8 days is similar to the IV preparation in range of activity. In a study of 53 elderly patients with SCLC treated with etoposide (200 mg/d for five times), there was a response rate of 79% and a median survival of 9.5 months. These results were similar to those achieved with more intensive IV regimens. Several studies of chronic oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/d for 21 times) have been reported recently. Responses were observed in SCLC and germ cell tumors among patients who had relapsed after standard etoposide-containing regimens. These data suggest that etoposide may be a \"new\" drug when given in this schedule. The high response rates with oral etoposide suggest that oral administration may be substituted for IV administration. This substitution may allow for greater flexibility in chemotherapeutic administration, less hospitalization, and more acceptable toxicity.\r"

Etoposide demonstrates remarkable schedule dependency. A randomized comparison has shown an impressive survival difference for patients with extensive SCLC receiving a 5-day course versus those receiving a 1-day course. Because of these and previous clinical and laboratory data, etoposide is now given intravenously or orally in a 3-day to 5-day schedule. It is generally accepted that approximately 50% of the orally administered drug is absorbed. The authors have initiated several etoposide studies using an extended administration schedule, believing that a prolonged schedule may be superior to the standard 3-day to 5-day schedule. This was initially tested in a Phase I study. Results showed that etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) given over 21 days was feasible and was associated with only moderate toxicity. Several Phase II studies have been completed or are nearing completion, including studies in patients with SCLC, NHL, germ cell tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, renal carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Responses have been seen in all of these groups, particularly in patients with SCLC, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. In these groups we saw responses in patients who were clearly resistant to etoposide plus cisplatin given in a standard schedule or in some patients who were resistant to high-dose etoposide with bone marrow transplantation. Investigators at Indiana University Medical Center who studied oral etoposide in a similar fashion in patients with advanced germ cell tumors and SCLC achieved results similar to those reported here. The authors have initiated a number of combination chemotherapy programs using the chronic oral form of etoposide. These include patients with SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer, and elderly patients with high-grade and intermediate forms of NHL. In addition, chronic intravenous oral etoposide is being used in salvage approaches for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and recurrent resistant intermediate-grade and high-grade NHL. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest that a 50-mg/m2 oral dose is highly bioavailable (91% to 96%). Therefore, during a prolonged oral course at 50 mg/m2, many patients maintain a minimum plasma concentration of 1 microgram/ml. Further studies of multiple dose or continuous infusion etoposide to maintain a potentially critical plasma level are in progress. Etoposide administered in this way could represent a \"new\" drug because many of its features are different, and its activity spectrum may be broader.\r"

Between 1978 and 1982, 68 patients were treated with combination chemotherapy (most received cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin [PVB] with or without doxorubicin). Thirty-eight patients (56%) responded to treatment, with 15 (22%) complete responder (CR) and 9 (13%) long-term, disease-free survivors. Since that time, we have incorporated etoposide into the treatment of these patients because of its synergism with cisplatin and its great activity against several other neoplasms, including germ cell tumors. Seventeen patients with PDC of unknown primary site received salvage therapy with etoposide and cisplatin after failing PVB. Ten of these patients had partial responses (PR), with a median response duration of 5 months (range, 2 to 12 months). Thirty-two previously untreated patients with PDC received etoposide and cisplatin combinations as initial treatment. Eighteen of 30 evaluable patients (60%) responded to therapy, and 11 patients (37%) had CR. Seven patients remain disease-free 39 to 63 months after the completion of therapy. Etoposide is an active drug in the treatment of PDC of unknown primary site. Preliminary results indicate that initial treatment with etoposide and cisplatin combinations produces results equivalent to or superior to those achieved with PVB.\r"

  ".W": "Etoposide is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of selected patients with germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Its optimal use is continuing to evolve. It is clear that schedule dependency is of critical importance. Recently, preliminary studies have suggested that a prolonged schedule of etoposide administration (21 days) may be more effective than the standard 3- to 5-day schedule. Results of several Phase II studies show chronic oral etoposide administration induces occasional responses in resistant tumors and higher-than-expected response rates in patients with germ cell tumors and SCLC. Preliminary data show nearly 90% etoposide absorption when given in a low-dose schedule (50 mg/m2/d) for 21 days. These observations indicate that etoposide may be a \"new drug\" when given in the chronic schedule. Further exploration of the schedule dependency of etoposide is indicated. Etoposide has recently been proven useful in selected patients with gastric, ovarian, and poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Several other drugs are either synergistic or additive and will be explored in combination chemotherapy. The possibility of adding topoisomerase I inhibitors and modulating etoposide's activity by inhibiting drug resistance is now within the realm of human testing.\r"

  ".W": "Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is increasingly used to treat cancer. Etoposide is a phase-specific, cytotoxic drug acting in the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle. It appears to cause breaks in DNA by either an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals. Most studies show a biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide. The peak plasma concentrations of drug and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) are linearly related to the IV dose. Considerable interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic variables exists after IV etoposide. Various metabolites of etoposide have been identified, but their detection and quantitation are disputed. Approximately 30% to 70% of an etoposide dose is excreted. The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing doses within the range in clinical use. Considerable interpatient and intrapatient variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of oral etoposide. There is no evidence of etoposide accumulation after multiple consecutive doses by either the IV or oral route. The exact roles of the liver and kidney in metabolism and excretion of etoposide are uncertain. Etoposide has been shown to be a highly schedule-dependent drug in clinical studies. This, together with the phase-specific action of etoposide and its increasingly widespread use in treating cancer, makes the clinical pharmacology of this drug of great clinical importance.\r"

  ".W": "The aggregation of red blood cells in blood flowing through small tubes at very low shear rates leads to the two-phase flow of an inner core of rouleaux surrounded by a cell-depleted peripheral layer. The formation of this layer is known to be accompanied by a decrease in hydrodynamic resistance to flow. To quantitate this effect, we measured the pressure gradient, flow rate, and the radius of the red blood cell core in suspensions flowing through tubes of 172-microns radius at mean linear flow rates (U) from 50 to 0.15 tube diameters.sec-1. Washed red blood cells were suspended in 1.5% buffered dextran 110 at hematocrits of 34-52%. Using syringe pumps, blood flowed from a stirred reservoir through a vertical 12-cm length of tube in either the upward or downward direction. The pressure drop was measured with transducers. Mean values in distributions in the core radius were obtained by analyzing cine films of flow taken through a microscope with flow in the upward direction, measuring the core radius at five equally spaced axial positions of the tube in each of 100 frames. At 34% and 46% hematocrit, the hydrodynamic resistance increased as U decreased from 50 sec-1, reaching a maximum at U-2 sec-1. It then decreased to a minimum at U less than 0.5 sec-1 as the red blood cell core formed in the tube, and the mean core radius/tube radius ratio decreased from 0.98 to 0.74 with marked axial fluctuations at the lower U. At higher hematocrits, both the increase and decrease in hydrodynamic resistance were greater. In a red blood cell albumin-saline suspension, where there is no aggregation of red blood cells and no two-phase flow, hydrodynamic resistance increases linearly with decreasing U. The experimental results were compared with the predictions of a two-phase steady-flow model, assuming axisymmetric flow of a core surrounded by cell-free suspending medium. Two models were considered, one in which the core is solid, the other in which the rheological properties of the suspension in the core are given by the Quemada equation. The effects of sedimentation of the core resulting in a zero net flow pressure gradient were taken into account. Provided that an experimentally extrapolated value for the zero pressure gradient was used, the Quemada-fluid model gave good agreement with the experimentally observed core radius as a function of U and hematocrit.\r"

  ".W": "Submucosal blood vessels of the mammalian stomach are densely innervated by neurons containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, neurokinin A, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Because all these peptides are vasodilators in certain vascular beds, we tested the hypothesis that rat alpha-CGRP, rat VIP, substance P, and neurokinin A are candidate mediators of noncholinergic vasodilator neurons in the gastric mucosa and submucosa. The experiments were performed on urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) was measured by the hydrogen gas clearance technique, and the peptides were infused close arterially to the stomach via a catheter inserted retrogradely in the splenic artery. Basal GMBF was in the range of 35-50 ml/min/100 g. Infusion of rat alpha-CGRP (15 and 75 pmol/min) significantly increased GMBF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lowered only by the higher dose of CGRP. Substance P (125 and 625 pmol/min) and neurokinin A (50 and 250 pmol/min) failed to alter GMBF, although the higher dose of each peptide led to a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Infusion of rat VIP (25 pmol/min) failed to affect GMBF and mean arterial blood pressure, whereas a fivefold higher dose of VIP (125 pmol/min) led to a significant rise of GMBF and to significant hypotension. These findings indicate that substance P and neurokinin A are unlikely to be of physiological significance for the regulation of GMBF. CGRP and VIP, however, can be considered as candidate mediators of submucosal nerve endings involved in the neural control of GMBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we investigated whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a role in the proliferative response of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to denuding injury. Rat carotid smooth muscle was found to express the mRNA for bFGF, and bFGF protein was found to be present in rat aorta by immunoblot analysis. Systemically administered bFGF was a potent mitogen for vascular SMCs in arteries denuded with a balloon catheter, increasing replication from 11.5% in controls to 54.8%. Denudation with a device (filament loop), which causes only minimal damage to medial SMCs, showed a similar increase in replication (1.3% versus 43.3%) after bFGF infusion. In unmanipulated vessels, however, SMCs were unresponsive to infused bFGF. Infusion of a \"mitotoxin\" (bFGF conjugated to saporin) caused a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable SMCs in the arterial wall after balloon injury. Prolonged administration of bFGF (12 micrograms/day for 2 weeks) after balloon injury caused an approximately twofold increase in intimal thickening. These results show that bFGF, which is synthesized by the arterial wall, could be a potent mitogen for SMCs in vivo and suggest that any release of endogenous bFGF may be capable of stimulating SMC proliferation, which may subsequently lead to intimal lesion formation.\r"

Regions were created on the culture substrate that either prevented (photoresist coat) or supported (glass surface) attachment of cells. In this way the geometry of interconnecting growth channels could be specified. Single-layered myocyte strands of variable length and with widths of as little as 65 micron (three to four cells wide) were obtained. The shape and orientation of the individual myocytes were a function of growth-channel width: the narrower the channel, the more elongated the cells and the more likely was the long axis to be oriented along the channel axis. In channels with width of 100 micron or less, cells were aligned longitudinally and cross-striated as in vivo. A high degree of morphological cell differentiation required the presence of contractile activity. Maximal diastolic potential (-71 mV), action potential amplitude (93 mV), and maximal upstroke velocity (140 V/sec) did not change with increasing culture age. Mean longitudinal conduction velocity was 0.39 m/sec. No electrophysiological or morphological evidence of photoresist toxicity was seen, and the data indicate a high degree of cell differentiation in the patterned cell cultures. The method thus is suitable for the study of the relation between impulse propagation and structure at a cellular level in artificial networks of predefined shape.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has inotropic and chronotropic effects in rat and guinea pig hearts. It also may mediate nonadrenergic noncholinergic regulation of canine cardiac electrophysiology. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to determine the anatomic distribution of CGRP in mature dog heart and autonomic ganglia controlling cardiac function. The stellate ganglia had scattered CGRP-immunoreactive cells and nerve processes; intracardiac ganglia contained stained nerve processes but no CGRP-immunoreactive cells. Although the extramural coronary arteries were modestly innervated by varicose individual nerve processes, the great majority of CGRP-immunoreactive neural tissue in the heart existed adjacent to the sinoatrial node where varicose nerve processes coursed in numerous large nerve bundles. Each bundle contained only a few stained processes, however, indicating that CGRP-immunoreactive nerve processes were accompanying another type of autonomic tissue. Double staining and immunoultrastructure confirmed that the nerve bundles were heterogeneous. Similar nerve bundles were fewer in the left atrium, the region of the atrioventricular node, atrioventricular bundle, and the ventricles. In contrast to the distribution of sympathetic neural tissue, CGRP-immunoreactive nerve processes virtually were nonexistent among muscle fibers. We conclude that 1) CGRP-immunoreactive neural tissue likely affects sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia that control cardiac function, 2) the preponderance of this nonadrenergic noncholinergic tissue near regions of specialized muscle (especially the sinoatrial node) suggests an efferent function in the canine heart, and 3) the presence of varicosities along CGRP-immunoreactive nerve processes within heterogeneous nerve bundles may indicate that direct axo-axonal contact is the mechanism by which these nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerve processes modulated other autonomic neural tissue.\r"

The binding association constant (KA) of the radioligand was measured in membrane-rich fractions of atrium, ventricle, and lung by a radioinhibitor binding assay. A single class of high-affinity binding sites was detected in each tissue, and a significant difference was found between KA values for atria and ventricles with a rank order of atria greater than lungs greater than ventricles. For autoradiography, coronal sections (10 micron) of the frozen heart were incubated with 125I-351A and exposed to x-ray film. The autoradiographs were quantitated by computerized image analysis. The highest density of ACE in the heart was found on valve leaflets (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid), which contrasted markedly with very low ACE labeling in the endocardium. The coronary arteries also showed dense labeling of ACE. The right atrium had a moderate density of ACE, which was higher than the left atrium and the ventricles. Both the endothelial and adventitial layers of the aorta and pulmonary artery displayed high densities of ACE, with very low density in the media. ACE was not detected in either the sinoatrial node or atrioventricular node. These results reveal a markedly nonuniform localization of ACE in the rat heart and suggest possible sites for local angiotensin II generation and bradykinin or other peptide metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Aspects of pH regulation in ferret ventricular cells have been investigated by using pH- and sodium-selective microelectrodes in bicarbonate-free Tyrode's solution. An acid load was produced by the transient application of NH4Cl (10 or 20 mmol/l). A complete recovery from an acid load was still observed after multiple applications of NH4Cl, but amiloride (0.75 or 1 mmol/l), a blocker of the Na-H exchanger, increased the acidification and inhibited the recovery. Measurements of intracellular sodium concentration showed a transient decrease during the application of NH4Cl and a transient increase above control values during recovery from acidification. This increase was inhibited by amiloride. Intracellular sodium loading (strophanthidin [low calcium-low potassium Tyrode's solution]) did not initially cause an intracellular pH (pHi) change, but the acidification induced by amiloride under those circumstances was larger. Reducing extracellular sodium concentration from 155 to 5 or to 1.5 mmol/l caused an acidification. Changing extracellular pH (pHo) from 6.4 to 8.4 caused an average linear change in pHi in the same direction of 0.085 pHi units/pHo units. The mean intracellular buffering capacity measured with the NH4Cl method and with the proton extrusion mechanism blocked by amiloride was 36 +/- 15 mmol pH-1.l-1 (mean +/- SD), approximately half that of previous estimations. Changing the metabolic substrate from glucose to pyruvate in the superfusing solution caused an acidification of 0.21 pH units. This could be partially blocked by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, a finding consistent with a pyruvate-H+ cotransport and/or a pyruvate-OH- countertransport system being present in ventricular cells. The results of the present study show that ventricular cells can effectively buffer hydrogen ions and that an Na-H exchange system plays a major role in the regulation of pHi.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical model of action potential propagation in a thick strand of cardiac muscle is presented. The calculation takes into account the anisotropic and syncytial properties of the tissue, the presence of the interstitial space, the effect of the surrounding tissue bath, and the variation of the potential both along the strand length and across the strand cross section. The bidomain model is used to represent the electrical properties of the tissue, and the Ebihara-Johnson model is used to represent the properties of the active sodium channels. The calculated wave front is curved, with the action potential at the surface of the strand leading that at the center. The rate of rise of the action potential and the time constant of the action potential foot vary with depth into the tissue. The velocity of the wave front is nearly independent of strand radius for radii greater than 0.5 mm. The conduction velocity decreases as the volume fraction of the interstitial space decreases. In the limit of tightly packed cells, an action potential propagates quickly over the surface of the strand; the bulk of the tissue is then excited by a slow inward wave front initiated on the surface. This model does not predict an increase in conduction velocity when cells are tightly packed, a hypothesis that has been proposed previously to explain the fast conduction velocity in Purkinje fibers of some species.\r"

Myocardial plasma flow rate and capillary extraction of chromium 51-labeled EDTA or technetium 99m-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were measured by the single-injection, residue-detection method before ischemia and 5 and 60 minutes after the start of reperfusion. In 13 dogs, no scavenger treatment was given (nonprotected control group), whereas eight dogs were treated systemically with 15,000 units/kg superoxide dismutase during 1 hour, starting 20 minutes before ischemia. In the control group, three dogs developed reperfusion ventricular fibrillation in contrast to none in the superoxide dismutase group. Before ischemia, plasma flow rate, myocardial capillary extraction fraction, and PS values were similar in the two groups. Five minutes after the start of reperfusion, plasma flow rate increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in both groups. In the control group, capillary extraction fraction increased by 12% (p = NS) in spite of the higher plasma flow; these increases in capillary extraction fraction and plasma flow induced a 69% increase in PS (p less than 0.01). In the superoxide dismutase-treated group, capillary extraction fraction decreased by 32% (p less than 0.05) in accordance with the increased plasma flow rate, resulting in an unchanged PS (p = NS). Sixty minutes after reperfusion, plasma flow rate, capillary extraction fraction, and PS returned to preocclusion values in both groups (p = NS). The increased capillary extraction fraction and PS values seen in the control group suggest an increased capillary permeability after ischemia and reperfusion. Superoxide anions seem to participate, directly or indirectly, in this response.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of in situ oxidative modification of sarcolemmal cholesterol on Ca2+ flux. Cholesterol oxidase was used to oxidatively modify membrane cholesterol. After incubation of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles with cholesterol oxidase, cholest-4-en-3-one (cholestenone) was the predominant species of oxidated cholesterol produced. Cholesterol oxidase inhibited sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange in a concentration-dependent manner. Both the Vmax and Km of the reaction were altered after cholesterol oxidase treatment. Extensive treatment of the sarcolemmal membranes with cholesterol oxidase increased the passive permeability characteristics of the membrane. Passive Ca2+ efflux from the sarcolemmal vesicles was stimulated by increasing the concentration of cholesterol oxidase. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was also inhibited after cholesterol oxidase treatment, but it was not as sensitive as the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Conversely, passive Ca2+ binding to sarcolemmal vesicles was strikingly stimulated by cholesterol oxidase treatment. The results demonstrate that oxidative modification of sarcolemmal membrane cholesterol can directly affect ionic interactions with the sarcolemmal vesicle and provide potentially important mechanistic information for the molecular basis of the effects of free radicals on ion flux and function in the heart.\r"

Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock, septic shock, or cardiopulmonary shock of varying severities and durations. The liver consistently had the greatest energy depletion, followed by the kidney, and then the small intestine. However, only the kidney developed clear morphological damage (S3 brush border sloughing). Kidney adenylate pools were better preserved during septic shock and cardiopulmonary shock than during hemorrhagic shock despite comparable blood pressures. Only profound hemorrhagic shock (35-40 mm Hg for 25 minutes) decreased total adenylate pools (ATP + ADP + AMP). However, the degree of renal catabolite (nucleosides plus purine base) accumulation did not correlate with the amount of renal total adenine nucleotide depletion, partially because circulating catabolites contributed to intrarenal catabolite pools. Purine base/uric acid ratios differed among shocked organs, consistent with different degrees of xanthine oxidase activity (small intestine greater than liver greater than kidney). Renal morphological damage decreased during the immediate (0-30 minutes) postshock period, and the extent of this improvement was not altered by xanthine oxidase inhibition (oxypurinol), suggesting that the immediate postshock period is not one of serious oxidative injury. Shock, in comparison with renal arterial occlusion, caused only modest ATP loss/catabolite accumulation, very low purine base/uric acid ratios, and no immediate-reperfusion (0-30 minutes) resynthesis of the total adenylate pool. Thus, ischemia-induced renal adenylate changes may differ considerably, depending on the nature of the ischemic event.\r"

The instantaneous diastolic pressure gradient was measured in 12 of the dogs. Pericardiectomy resulted in an increase in early mitral velocity, peak early diastolic pressure gradient, and E/A but not early mitral velocity normalized for end-diastolic volume. In contrast, for the tricuspid valve flow, pericardiectomy did not change E but caused a marked increase in A and a decrease in E/A. Right ventricular end-diastolic volumes at matched left ventricular end-diastolic volumes were similar before and after the pericardium was removed. However, removal of the pericardium caused a significant decrease of the slope for the right (86.0 +/- 27.0 x 10(-4) versus 50.0 +/- 19.5 x 10(-4) mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.01), but not left, ventricular ln end-diastolic pressure-volume relation (21.2 +/- 9.2 x 10(-3) versus 21.4 +/- 5.3 x 10(-3) mm Hg/ml, p = NS), and a decrease of the pressure intercept for the left (3.0 +/- 2.0 versus 1.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), but not right, ventricular ln end-diastolic pressure-volume relation (2.8 +/- 1.4 versus 1.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p = NS). In conclusion, filling of the two ventricles is affected by the pericardium over a wide range of physiological ventricular volumes and pressures. At matched left ventricular end-diastolic volume, pericardiectomy causes a fundamental alteration in right, but not left, ventricular filling.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of L-arginine (the substrate for the formation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide) in vascular tissues. Rat aortic rings, with or without endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of isometric tension; they were contracted with phenylephrine (10(-6) M). After a short incubation period (0.5 hour) in physiological salt solution, L-arginine induced minor changes in both types of rings. In contrast, when the incubation time was increased (2, 4, 6, and 8 hours), L-arginine evoked concentration- and time-dependent relaxations in aortic rings both with and without endothelium. The relaxations were larger in rings with endothelium. The presence of L-arginine (10(-3) M) in the incubation medium inhibited subsequent relaxations evoked by the amino acid. The concentration-relaxation curves associated with acetylcholine in rings with endothelium and the curves associated with Sin-1, a spontaneous donor of nitric oxide, in rings with or without endothelium were slightly but significantly shifted to the right after a 6-hour incubation. Nitro-L-arginine (3 x 10(-5) M) and methylene blue (3 x 10(-7) M) attenuated the relaxations evoked by L-arginine in rings both with and without endothelium. Other basic amino acids (D-arginine, L-homoarginine, L-citrulline, L-lysine, and L-ornithine; all tested at 10(-3) M) either had no effect or induced small relaxations and did not affect the response to L-arginine. These observations suggest that L-arginine specifically and stereoselectively relaxes aortic rings with and without endothelium, probably by restoring the endogenous pool of the amino acid, which is likely depleted by prolonged incubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements of total intramyocardial blood volume were made by using [125I]albumin as a plasma marker and technetium-99m as a red blood cell marker. In one group of rats (n = 8), diastolic arrest was induced by an intravenous injection of KCl; in a second group (n = 8), systolic arrest was induced by an intravenous injection of BaCl2. In both groups, the hearts were frozen in situ immediately after heart arrest while aortic pressure was decaying from its former physiological level. The left ventricular free wall was sectioned transmurally in a cryomicrotome, and the blood volume within each tissue sample was calculated from its radioactivity. The volume of blood in vessels larger than 100 microns was independently estimated from the exposed cross-sectional area of these vessels in photographs of the frozen tissue taken during tissue sectioning in the cryomicrotome. Total intramyocardial blood volume was found to decrease by about 42% from 8.6 +/- 1.3 ml/100 g (mean +/- SEM) in the KCl group to 5.0 +/- 0.7 ml/100 g in the BaCl2 group (p less than 0.01).

In the mature heart, the analysis of ventricular pressure and volume accurately defines function. Because in vivo measures of volume are not feasible in the embryonic heart, we tested the hypothesis that ventricular pressure-area loops accurately define ventricular function in the stage 16 to stage 24 white Leghorn chick embryo. We simultaneously measured ventricular pressure with a servo-null pressure system and recorded video images at 60 Hz. The pressure waveform was superimposed onto the video image in real time. Video fields were planimetered for epicardial ventricular cross-sectional area and ventricular pressure. Pressure and area data were smoothed using a fast Fourier transform filter and plotted. Data are reported as mean +/- SEM, n greater than or equal to 4, and were tested by regression analysis and analysis of variance (p less than 0.05). Heart rate increased from 90 +/- 7 beats/min at stage 16 to 130 +/- 13 beats/min at stage 24. All pressure-area loops displayed diastolic filling, isometric contraction, ejection, and isometric relaxation, similar to pressure-volume loops of the mature heart. Isometric contraction time increased from 42 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 4 msec (p less than 0.05), while isometric relaxation time was 124 +/- 12 and 120 +/- 10 msec (p greater than 0.05) between stages 16 and 24, respectively. The maximum ratio of instantaneous ventricular pressure to area identified end systole better than peak ventricular pressure or minimum ventricular area. Thus, pressure-area relations define ventricular function in the embryonic chick heart.\r"

  ".W": "The relative contribution of postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors to constriction of microvessels was examined during sympathetic nerve stimulation and sympathetic escape (difference between peak and steady-state constriction). Large arterioles (120 +/- 4 microns control diameter) and venules (174 +/- 6 microns) and small arterioles (13 +/- 4 microns) were examined in rat cremaster skeletal muscle during stimulation of the cremaster efferent innervation (decentralized lumbar sympathetic chain, 0.5-16 Hz, 2-minute train). The muscle was suspended in a tissue bath, and diameter was measured with intravital microscopy. Frequency-response curves were obtained after vehicle (prazosin or rauwolscine) was added to the bath. In large arterioles, prazosin (10(-7) M) significantly attenuated constriction by 60-80%; a fivefold higher concentration had no additional effect. In contrast, rauwolscine (1 to 5 x 10(-7) M) had no effect. Venules evidenced minimal response to nerve stimulation. In small arterioles, rauwolscine (5 x 10(-7) M) significantly attenuated constriction by 50-60%, while prazosin (10(-7) M) had no effect. These data suggest that for large arterioles, which are known to possess both receptors, alpha 1-adrenoceptors are preferentially stimulated by nerve-released norepinephrine. In contrast, sympathetic constriction of small arterioles is mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Compared with large arterioles, small arterioles exhibited greater peak and steady-state constriction at all frequencies, with maximal responses achieved over the 0.5-4 Hz range. Large arterioles exhibit graded constriction over the entire frequency range. Sympathetic escape exhibited a small, negatively correlated frequency dependence for large arterioles, tended to be greater for small arterioles, and was more evident in large arterioles during alpha 2-adrenoceptor constriction at low-frequency stimulation. This distinct neural control of large resistance vessels by alpha 1-adrenoceptors and small terminal arterioles by alpha 2-adrenoceptors may allow neurogenic regulation of these vessel segments to be differentially susceptible to modulation by other extrinsic and intrinsic vasoactive controls that preferentially interact with alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic contractile mechanisms.\r"

After platelet-rich plasma from patients with acute ischemic heart disease (n = 43), whose platelets showed impaired prostaglandin E1/I2 receptor activity (850 +/- 100 sites/10(8) platelets), was incubated with insulin (optimum amounts varied from 100 to 200 microunits/ml), the binding of the prostanoid was restored to normal levels (1,790 +/- 140 sites/10(8) platelets) in 75% of the cases. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not respond to the stimulatory effect of insulin. The increased binding of the prostanoid to the insulin-treated platelets also resulted in increased cyclic AMP levels both in normal subjects (44.14 +/- 3.1 pmol/10(8) [insulin-treated] platelets versus 16.35 +/- 2.91 pmol/10(8) [control] platelets) and in patients with acute ischemic heart disease (23.87 +/- 4.1 pmol/10(8) [insulin-treated] platelets versus 7.70 +/- 2.0 pmol/10(8) [control] platelets) by the prostanoid (1.0 microM). The treatment of platelet-rich plasma with the hormone decreased the minimum inhibitory concentration of the prostanoid from 34 +/- 14 to 15 +/- 9 nM (p less than 0.001) in the case of normal volunteers and from 49 +/- 15 to 32 +/- 11 nM (p = 0.002) in the case of \"responder\" patients. Insulin did not produce any effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation by the prostaglandin in \"nonresponder\" patients. In the follow-up study, although the stimulatory effects of insulin on platelets from responder patients were improved to normal levels, the platelets from the nonresponder patients remained persistently unresponsive to the effect of the hormone.\r"

Isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure fell by more than 50% within 30 seconds of the onset of total global ischemia and reached zero by 5 minutes. Monophasic action potential recordings revealed no decrease in excitability during this period. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained at 30-second resolution showed no significant changes in inorganic phosphate or phosphocreatine during the first 30 seconds of ischemia. Intracellular pH (pHi) and ATP changed even more slowly; therefore, none of these metabolites could account for the rapid fall in force. To gauge the contribution of intravascular pressure, we compared ordinary aortic flow occlusion with tissue-level ischemia induced by massive coronary microembolization at the level of the precapillary arterioles. Functional depression developed significantly more slowly in the microembolized hearts, despite accumulation of inorganic phosphate and protons comparable with that in ordinary ischemia. After microembolization, the time course of functional depression reflected much more closely the concomitant inorganic phosphate and pHi changes. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the importance of vascular collapse in the mechanism of early ischemic contractile failure.\r"

Neither plasma NE nor NE spillover was affected by either infusion, and NE clearance declined slightly with both. No changes occurred in any variable during vehicle infusions in the supine position. During upright tilt, NE spillover increases were attenuated by both AII and phenylephrine while NE clearance changes were slightly greater, leaving plasma NE increases similar on each day.

  ".W": "Endothelin, a 21-amino acid vasoactive peptide, is among the most potent positively inotropic agents yet described in mammalian heart. Having demonstrated that endothelin's inotropic effect is due, in part, to an apparent sensitization of cardiac myofilaments to intracellular calcium, we determined whether this could be due to a rise in intracellular pH (pHi). In isolated adult rat ventricular cells loaded with the H(+)-selective fluorescent probe BCECF, 100 pM endothelin increased contractile amplitude to 190 +/- 26% of baseline and pHi by 0.08 +/- 0.02 (n = 8), whereas 1 nM endothelin increased pHi by 0.13 +/- 0.03 with little further increase in contractility. Amiloride (10(-4)M) prevented the increase in pHi in response to endothelin and reduced the inotropic response by 45%, although the inotropic effect could be readily restored by subsequent NH4Cl-induced alkalinization. Similarly, inhibitors of protein kinase C (H-7 and sphingosine) diminished or abolished the rise in pHi after endothelin superfusion while causing a decline in its inotropic effect comparable with that observed with amiloride. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin, which we have demonstrated results in complete ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunits of Go and Gi GTP-binding proteins and abolition of endothelin's positive inotropic effect, only partially reduced the intracellular alkalinization induced by the peptide, suggesting a complex signal transduction mechanism. Thus, the positive inotropic action of endothelin is due in part to stimulation of the sarcolemmal Na(+)-H+ exchanger by a protein kinase C-mediated pathway, resulting in a rise in pHi and sensitization of cardiac myofilaments to intracellular Ca2+.\r"

After the switch from alpha-MHC to beta-MHC, the beta-MHC occurred initially in the form of the heterodimer. After 4 and 6 days, V2 was greater (p less than 0.05) than V3. At day 8, V2 was smaller than V3, and at day 10, V2 was not statistically different from V3. From day 12 onward, V2 was smaller than V3. After 21 days, the propylthiouracil treatment was stopped, and the remaining 34 hypothyroid rats were injected with a daily dose of thyroxine (average, 0.1 mg/kg body wt), resulting in a switch from beta-MHC to alpha-MHC. After 1 day, V2 still was greater than V1; however, already from day 3 onward, V2 was smaller than V1. This characteristic but unexplained heterodimeric and homodimeric organization of the thick filament was analyzed by mathematical models involving probability calculations. Two principally different models were established that assume either the exchange of MHC dimers or of single MHC in the thick filament. The parameters of the models were estimated by minimization routines using the squared discrepancies between the experimental and predicted isoenzyme populations. Based on goodness of fit and crucial model parameters, we concluded that the characteristic organization of the thick filament can be accounted for by an exchange involving predominantly MHC dimers and not single MHC. The fact that V2 was lower than expected if formation of heterodimers and homodimers were random was attributed to the preferred homodimerization of 35% of the newly synthesized MHC.\r"

Under voltage clamp, the maximum whole-cell KATP channel conductance was estimated (195 +/- 10 nS, n = 6) by exposing the cells to complete metabolic blockade (2 mM cyanide in the presence of 10 mM 2-deoxy-glucose). In isolated inside-out membrane patches, the ATP dependence of KATP channel activity under relevant conditions was measured (half-maximal inhibition at 114 microM). Under current clamp (with intracellular ATP concentration = 5 mM), the effect of graded KATP channel activation on the action potential and the twitch was estimated by injection of a current (proportional to voltage) that simulated the KATP conductance. As this \"conductance\" was increased, the action potential was shortened, and contractile amplitude declined, as expected. From the results of these experiments, the quantitative dependence of the action potential duration on intracellular ATP concentration was estimated, without relying on a mathematical model of the cell membrane. The results imply that KATP-dependent action potential shortening is likely to occur if ATP concentration falls below normal levels (approximately 5 mM), as may happen regionally, or globally, during myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "91084931\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are potent hypertrophic agents in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The present study identified major proteins that accumulate in Ang II-induced and AVP-induced hypertrophic cells and initiated studies of the mechanisms that contribute to their accumulation. Smooth muscle cell hypertrophy induced by Ang II and/or AVP (1 microM each) was associated with widespread increases in the content of many cellular proteins that were resolved by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. However, increases were also selective in nature, with increases in certain individual proteins, including actin (twofold to threefold), vimentin (2.5-fold to sevenfold), tropomyosin (threefold to sixfold), and myosin heavy chain, far exceeding overall increases in cellular protein content (20-40%). Increases in actin content were due largely to increased expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (3.6- to 7.5-fold), as opposed to nonmuscle beta-actin (1.7- to 2.5-fold). Increases in smooth muscle alpha-actin were accompanied by a fivefold to eightfold increases in smooth muscle alpha-actin mRNA, indicating that these changes were not due exclusively to translational controls. Results demonstrate that contractile agonist-induced hypertrophy in cultured smooth muscle cells is due, in part, to increased expression of smooth muscle contractile proteins. Furthermore, the fact that Ang II and AVP induced selective increases in smooth muscle alpha-actin suggests that these agonists may not only regulate growth of vascular smooth muscle but may also promote expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins during differentiation of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "91084932\r", 
  ".W": "We sought to determine the ejection variables that are principally responsible for increases in isovolumic ventricular relaxation rate observed with increases in stroke volume. In nine isolated canine hearts, left ventricular ejection was controlled by patterns specially designed to isolate the ejection parameters most critical to isovolumic relaxation rate. When stroke volume was augmented by increases in end-diastolic volume (EDV) with end-systolic volume (ESV) held constant, isovolumic ventricular relaxation rate was unchanged, as gauged by the time constants of single-exponential fits to decaying pressure. In contrast, when ESV was decreased with EDV held constant, isovolumic relaxation time constants decreased significantly, from approximately 100 to 70 msec (protocol I). The important difference in these two situations might have been that the time of end ejection was delayed in the case with faster isovolumic relaxation. To rule out other parameters that may have influenced isovolumic relaxation, ejection velocity was varied in another protocol (protocol II) by either delays in time of the onset of ejection or advances in end-ejection time, always with constant ESV and EDV. Here isovolumic relaxation was progressively slowed as end ejection occurred earlier, whereas isovolumic relaxation rate was insensitive to changes in the onset of ejection, consistent with the unique importance of end ejection to isovolumic relaxation. In fact, our analysis reveals the remarkable finding that changes in isovolumic relaxation time constant produced by either protocol I or protocol II could be related quantitatively to end ejection by a single curve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pretreatment with colchicine did not affect the ability of L-thyroxine to induce cardiac hypertrophy but prevented its effects on both beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors.

  ".W": "The nervous system and the autonomic system in particular have been associated with stress-induced changes in host resistance to infections and inflammatory reactions. Since a key step in initiation of inflammation is adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium, we hypothesized that neuron-derived factors might be involved in this process. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino acid neuropeptide that is colocalized and released with norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves, has already been implicated in inflammatory reactions via modulation of histamine release from mast cells. This study was undertaken to examine the potential role of NPY in proinflammatory processes via modulation of endothelium-leukocyte interaction. NPY (0.01-10 microM) increased the adhesion of 51Cr-labeled human neutrophils or the human monocytic U937 cell line to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesiveness occurred as early as 30 minutes and lasted over 48 hours. The increase of leukocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells by NPY was not inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, nor was it associated with expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells; in contrast, strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin. These data suggest that neuron-derived factors such as NPY may serve as modulators of not only the neuromuscular unit but also the interaction of endothelial cells with leukocytes. In this capacity, the sympathetic nervous system might play an important role in the regulation of proaggregatory and hemostatic activity of microvessels.\r"

In the intact heart, initiation of these arrhythmias is promoted by pacing, especially at fast rates. However, the relevance of the number of stimuli is unknown. In conscious dogs with formalin-induced atrioventricular block, we investigated the effect of variations in pacing mode on 1) the behavior of nonsustained triggered rhythms at progressive levels of ouabain intoxication, and 2) the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Twenty experiments were analyzed. Ouabain was administered as a bolus of 40 micrograms/kg followed by continuous infusion. Every 15 minutes the pacing protocol was repeated, with a maximum of 10, until completion or induction of VT. When VT could not be initiated, the experiment was repeated at least 1 week later, adding 5-10 micrograms/kg ouabain to the bolus and increasing the infusion rate correspondingly. This was repeated until VT could be induced. Four interstimulus intervals (200, 400, 600, and 800 msec) and seven numbers of stimuli (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, and 150) were given in two pacing protocols. The effect of these protocols on 1) the number of induced beats per stimulation train, 2) their first postpacing interval, and 3) induction of VT were studied. Initiation of VT occurred after 75 +/- 42 minutes. The bolus of ouabain needed to induce VT was inversely related to the body weight of the animals. Progression of ouabain intoxication resulted in 1) a significant increase in the number of induced beats per stimulation train and 2) a significant shortening of the first postpacing interval. Stimulation at a faster rate and/or more stimuli resulted in 1) a significantly pronounced increase in the number of induced beats at the higher levels and 2) a significantly shorter first postpacing interval at successive levels of ouabain intoxication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hearts of healthy hamsters developed similar pressures when perfused with either glucose or pyruvate, and [Ca2+]i transients were comparable in amplitude when perfused with either substrate. On the other hand, hearts of cardiomyopathic hamsters in late failure developed normal pressure when perfused with pyruvate but developed depressed pressure (50%) when perfused with glucose. The amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients fell severely and was associated with a high diastolic [Ca2+]i in cardiomyopathic hamster hearts when the perfusate was switched from pyruvate to glucose. The high phosphomonoester sugars as evidenced by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies and the depressed oxygen consumption in the cardiomyopathic hamster hearts perfused with glucose reflect an inhibition in glycolysis and a subsequent decrease in mitochondrial activity. Without an adequate delivery of substrate to the mitochondria in the cardiomyopathic hamster, the myocardium is no longer capable of maintaining its [Ca2+]i homeostasis.\r"

There is little data available on whether ischemic preconditioning (PC) of hearts can reduce the incidence of such arrhythmias. The effect of PC (three cycles of 2 minutes of coronary occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion) on development of arrhythmias after a subsequent 5-minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion was studied. Rats (n = 16 each group) underwent 5-minute occlusion and reperfusion alone or preceded by PC; arrhythmias were monitored during ischemia and for 10 minutes of reperfusion, and biopsies were taken for creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate in ischemic and nonischemic zones of the left ventricle. PC reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during occlusion (81% control versus 13% PC, p less than 0.001). On subsequent reperfusion, ventricular fibrillation (VF) developed in zero PC animals versus 13 (81%) of controls (p less than 0.001), and irreversible VF in zero of PC versus seven (44%) of controls (p = 0.007). VT occurred in four (25%) of PC versus all (100%) of controls (p less than 0.001). PC reduced mean duration of VT plus VF from 320 +/- 54 to 5 +/- 1 seconds (p less than 0.001) and delayed arrhythmia onset from 8 +/- 2 to 85 +/- 35 seconds after reperfusion.

This alternation in the size of the contraction is paralleled by alternation in the size of the intracellular Ca2+ transient (monitored using the photoprotein aequorin). In isolated myocytes, the large contraction is accompanied by a prolonged action potential. Mechanical alternans also can be induced by acidosis in isolated myocytes during a train of voltage-clamp pulses. Thus, it appears unlikely that the mechanical alternans is secondary to changes in action potential duration; it is more likely that the observed changes in action potential duration are secondary to changes in the size of the Ca2+ transient. The observation that a Ca2(+)-activated inward current also shows alternation during mechanical alternans provides a possible mechanism for the link between Ca2+ and action potential duration. The alternation in the size of the Ca2+ transient may be secondary to the slowed mechanical restitution observed in papillary muscles during acidosis. This also could explain the observation that decreasing stimulation rate can abolish the alternans.\r"

E-4031 (1 microM) increased RP by 50% with no effect on contractile force in papillary muscles isolated from guinea pig heart. ISO (1 microM) increased force of contraction more than fivefold and decreased RP by 25%. The prolongation of RP by E-4031 was prevented by pretreatment of muscles with ISO. The prolongation of APD in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes by 5 microM E-4031 also was antagonized by prior exposure of the cells to 1 microM ISO. Instantaneous currents and delayed rectifier K+ currents, IK, were measured in isolated myocytes using the suction microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Currents were measured in response to 225-msec depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -40 mV. Previous studies have demonstrated that IK in these cells results from activation of two distinct outward K+ currents, IKs and IKr (specifically blocked by E-4031). ISO doubled the magnitude of IKs without significant effect on IKr. The instantaneous current, putatively identified as a Cl- current, also was doubled by ISO but was unaffected by E-4031. The augmented conductance of IKs and instantaneous current by ISO results in a decrease in RP. The small effect of E-4031 on APD and RP in the presence of ISO results from the smaller contribution of IKr relative to the augmented repolarizing currents.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between reflected waves and features of ascending aortic pressure waveforms and impedance patterns was investigated with a modified T-tube model of the systemic arterial circulation. Ascending aortic pressure and flow and descending aortic flow were measured in 10 dogs under basal conditions and under the effect of an agent (methoxamine) that caused vasoconstriction and an increase of mean aortic pressure. A broad range of aortic pressure amplitudes and features was obtained. These waveshapes were classified into four groups. Under basal conditions, cases for which a prominent diastolic fluctuation was present (n = 8) were grouped in A. Cases for which this fluctuation was absent (n = 2) were grouped in B. Groups C (n = 4) and D (n = 3) included cases that, under vasoconstricted conditions, did or did not display, respectively, a diastolic fluctuation in pressure. Arterial T-tube model parameters were estimated by simultaneously fitting the model to both ascending and descending aortic flow with aortic pressure as input. A good fit was obtained in any case considered. After parameter estimation, forward and reflected waves and impedance patterns at the entrance of head circulation (head and upper limbs) and body circulation (trunk and lower limbs) as well as their merger in the ascending aorta were determined. T-tube input impedance compared well with impedance data points obtained from the ratio of corresponding harmonics of ascending aortic pressure and flow. In some cases (group A), modulus and phase spectra displayed two distinct minima, in the range from 0 to 10 Hz. In some other circumstances, these minima were less distinct (groups B and C) and could even appear as one (group D). Whether one or two minima appeared in the ascending aortic impedance spectra at low frequency and whether a prominent diastolic fluctuation did or did not appear in aortic pressure, pressure and flow waveshapes proximal to the heart were explained by the presence of two effective reflecting sites in the systemic circulation. In group B, a diastolic fluctuation in pressure was absent despite the fact that head-end and body-end reflected waves were distinct. This happened because body-end reflected waves peaked corresponding to a minimum of the head-end reflected wave. In group D, a diastolic fluctuation in aortic pressure was absent because the body-end reflected wave moved into systole and superimposed on the head-end reflected wave. This superimposition was due to increased pulse wave velocity in the body transmission path as a result of decreased arterial distensibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The evidence that ETS increases risk of death from heart disease is similar to that which existed in 1986 when the US Surgeon General concluded that ETS caused lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers. There are 10 epidemiological studies, conducted in a variety of locations, that reflect about a 30% increase in risk of death from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction among nonsmokers living with smokers. The larger studies also demonstrate a significant dose-response effect, with greater exposure to ETS associated with greater risk of death from heart disease. These epidemiological studies are complemented by a variety of physiological and biochemical data that show that ETS adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium in a way that increases the risk of heart disease. Moreover, ETS, in realistic exposures, also exerts significant adverse effects on exercise capability of both healthy people and those with heart disease by reducing the body's ability to deliver and utilize oxygen. In animal experiments, ETS also depresses cellular respiration at the level of mitochondria. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ETS also accelerate, and may initiate, the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Of note, the cardiovascular effects of ETS appear to be different in nonsmokers and smokers. Nonsmokers appear to be more sensitive to ETS than do smokers, perhaps because some of the affected physiological systems are sensitive to low doses of the compounds in ETS, then saturate, and also perhaps because of physiological adaptions smokers undergo as a result of long-term exposure to the toxins in cigarette smoke. In any event, these findings indicate that, for cardiovascular disease, it is incorrect to compute \"cigarette equivalents\" for passive exposure to ETS and then to extrapolate the effects of this exposure on nonsmokers from the effects of direct smoking on smokers. These results suggest that heart disease is an important consequence of exposure to ETS. The combination of epidemiological studies with demonstration of physiological changes with exposure to ETS, together with biochemical evidence that elements of ETS have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, leads to the conclusion that ETS causes heart disease. This increase in risk translates into about 10 times as many deaths from ETS-induced heart disease as lung cancer; these deaths contribute greatly to the estimated 53,000 deaths annually from passive smoking. This toll makes passive smoking the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States today, behind active smoking and alcohol.\r"

The ventricular activation patterns were characterized by delayed right ventricular activation and the absence of normal early epicardial ventricular breakthrough in some cases. The repolarization patterns were characterized by nonuniform distribution of T wave morphologies. The T waves were predominantly positive over the left ventricular epicardium and negative or biphasic over the right ventricular epicardium. The activation-recovery (A-R) intervals were measured from the local activation to the maximal dV/dt of the upstroke of the T waves (Wyatt method). The difference between the A-R intervals and the MAP from onset of activation to 90% repolarization (MAP90) varies according to T wave morphology and could be as high as 96 msec with positive T waves, despite significant correlations (r = 0.56-0.90) between MAP90 and A-R intervals for each morphology. Better overall correlations were found if the minimal dV/dt on the downslope of the positive T waves was chosen to estimate the time of local repolarization (alternative method). Using this method, the mean A-R intervals were the same over the right and left ventricles. Cardiopulmonary bypass significantly prolonged the action potential duration equally at all parts of the epicardium. We conclude that in patients with right ventricular hypertrophy, the time of local repolarization can be estimated by our alternative method; the right ventricle completes activation and repolarization later than the left ventricle, and the distribution of T wave morphologies is nonuniform, with predominantly positive T waves observed over the left ventricle and negative or biphasic T waves observed over the right ventricle. These findings are compatible with the SI model of the generation of T waves.\r"

Anistreplase is a second generation thrombolytic agent that is easily administered and has a long duration of action. To compare anistreplase (30 units/2-5 min) and therapy with the Food and Drug Administration-approved regimen of intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million units/60 min), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter patency trial was undertaken in 370 patients less than 76 years of age with electrocardiographic ST segment elevation who could be treated within 4 hours of symptom onset. Coronary patency was determined by reading, in a blinded fashion, angiograms obtained early (90-240 minutes; mean, 140 minutes) and later (18-48 hours; mean, 28 hours) after beginning therapy. Early total patency (defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 2 or 3 perfusion) was high after both anistreplase (132/183 = 72%) and streptokinase (129/176 = 73%) therapy, and overall patency patterns were similar, although patent arteries showed \"complete\" (grade 3) perfusion more often after anistreplase (83%) than streptokinase (72%) (p = 0.03). Similarly, residual coronary stenosis, determined quantitatively by a validated computer-assisted method, was slightly less in patent arteries early after anistreplase (mean stenosis diameter, 74.0%) than streptokinase (77.2%, p = 0.02). In patients with patent arteries without other early interventions, reocclusion risk within 1-2 days was defined angiographically and found to be very low (anistreplase = 1/96, streptokinase = 2/94). Average coronary perfusion grade was greater, and percent residual stenosis was less, at follow-up than on initial evaluation and did not differ between treatment groups. Enzymatic and electrocardiographic evolution was not significantly different in the two groups. Despite rapid injection, anistreplase was associated with only a small (4-5 mm Hg), transient (at 5-10 minutes) mean differential fall in blood pressure. In-hospital mortality rates were comparable for anistreplase and streptokinase (5.9%, 7.1%). Stroke occurred in one (0.5%) and three (1.6%) patients, respectively; one stroke was hemorrhagic. Other serious bleeding events and adverse experiences occurred uncommonly and with similar frequency in the two groups. Thus, for the end points of our study (patency, safety), anistreplase and streptokinase showed overall favorable and relatively comparable outcomes, with a few differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At 36 months of follow-up, the cumulative patency rate (CPR) was 63%. A complete reobstruction in 32 patients (24%) and a partial reobstruction in 15 patients (11%) were found angiographically. The CPR after 36 months was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients younger than 60 years of age (54%) than in patients older than 60 (68%); it was also significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with reduced peripheral runoff (55%) due to obstructed arteries of the lower leg than in patients with unaffected runoff (73%). The CPR was 65% in recanalized segments shorter than 7 cm and was 62% in recanalized segments longer than 7 cm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these, 39 received aspirin and dipyridamole only (group 1) and 174 received aspirin, dipyridamole, and warfarin for 1-3 months (group 2). There was no abrupt closure (less than or equal to 1 day) or perioperative death in either group. In-hospital or perioperative complications in group 1 compared with group 2 were as follows: subacute closure (1-14 days), seven (18%) patients versus one (0.6%) patient, respectively, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction, five (13%) patients versus one (0.6%) patient, respectively; condition requiring urgent bypass surgery, one (2.5%) patient versus no patients, respectively. Thus, the incidence of major complications such as death, myocardial infarction, or a condition requiring urgent bypass surgery was 15% in group 1 and 0.6% in group 2. Clinical follow-up revealed that 92% of the patients were asymptomatic at 3 months after stenting compared with 6% before stenting (p less than 0.0001). Of the 13 patients who were symptomatic, nine underwent cardiac catheterization and, ultimately, successful elective coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery. We conclude that a high delivery success rate can be expected with this device and that clinical thrombosis is less frequent in anticoagulated patients than in nonanticoagulated patients. Furthermore, in this selected patient population, coronary stenting results in a low incidence of in-hospital and perioperative complications. Clinical success, defined by absence of symptoms, appears to be sustained at 3 months.\r"

LP10 and LP20 were significantly lower in the Paf than in the control group (LP10, 1.92 +/- 0.58 versus 2.49 +/- 0.78 microV, p less than 0.001; LP20, 2.47 +/- 0.78 versus 3.46 +/- 1.20 microV, p less than 0.0001), although no significant difference in LP30 was found between groups.

These differences between the Paf and control groups remained significant even after dividing by the presence or absence of organic heart diseases. The criteria of \"LP20 = 3.5 microV or less\" and \"Ad greater than 120 msec\" as defining \"atrial late potential\" gave a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 76%.

All patients were clinically stable and without evidence of valve dysfunction. Valve size ranged from 19 to 31 mm, and ejection fraction ranged from 30% to 75%. With the parasternal long-axis view, the left ventricular outflow diameter measured just proximal to the prosthetic valve correlated well with valve size (r = 0.92). Doppler-derived maximal gradients ranged from 9 to 71 mm Hg. Effective prosthetic aortic valve area by the continuity equation ranged between 0.73 cm2 for a 19-mm valve and 4.23 cm2 for a 31-mm valve. With analysis of variance, effective orifice area differentiated various valve sizes (p less than 10(-14)) better than did gradients alone (p = 0.003) and correlated better with actual valve orifice area (r = 0.83 versus - 0.40). A Doppler velocity index, the ratio of peak velocity in the left ventricular outflow to that of the aortic jet, averaged 0.41 +/- 0.09 and was less dependent on valve size (r = 0.43). Thus, the continuity equation can be applied to the assessment of prosthetic St. Jude valves in the aortic position. By accounting for flow through the valve, it provides an improved assessment over the sole use of gradients in the evaluation of prosthetic valve function.\r"

Despite angiographic vessel patency, image-derived ratios of in vivo S12 binding in injured versus uninjured vascular segments were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) after one PTA (1.3 +/- 0.17, n = 7), PTA twice at 6-week intervals (1.4 +/- 0.22, n = 7), and PTA plus stent placement (1.6 +/- 0.28, n = 7) compared with control experiments (1.1 +/- 0.13, n = 7). Ex vivo imaging of blood-free excised aortas confirmed S12 localization at PTA (2 +/- 0.4, n = 3) and PTA plus stent placement (5 +/- 3.8, n = 7) sites (both p less than 0.05 versus controls). S12 antibody uptake decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) at 1 week after PTA plus stent placement in vivo (1.1 +/- 0.10, n = 4) and ex vivo (1.6 +/- 0.7, n = 3). Electron microscopic studies confirmed dense platelet, fibrin, and red blood cell deposition in regions of acute injury, with endothelial neointimal proliferation at 1 week after PTA. Immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed specific in vivo S12 binding (22:1 versus nonrelevant IgG) at sites of alpha-granule GMP-140 expression in activated platelets. Therefore, S12 studies may be useful to localize sites of platelet-derived mitogen release at arterial PTA injury sites.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that intracoronary administration of adenosine enhances myocardial salvage 24 hours after reperfusion. To determine if these beneficial effects could be obtained during a prolonged period of reperfusion using an intravenous route of administration, 22 closed-chest dogs were subjected to 90 minutes of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 72 hours of reperfusion. Animals randomly received either intravenous adenosine (0.15 mg/kg/min) or an equal volume of Ringer's lactate during the first 150 minutes of reperfusion. The area at risk was defined in vivo with Monastral blue, and infarct size was measured histologically with Mallory's trichrome stain. Serial global and regional ventricular function were determined with contrast ventriculography and analyzed using a computerized radial shortening method. Biopsies were obtained from the central ischemic zone to assess endothelial ultrastructure and capillary obstruction. No significant effects in heart rate or blood pressure were noted during adenosine infusion. Transmural collateral blood flow during ischemia was similar in the groups. Infarct size expressed as a percentage of the anatomical area at risk was significantly less in the adenosine-treated group (35.3 +/- 4.3% in controls versus 17.1 +/- 4.3% in treated animals, p less than 0.01). A progressive decrease in transmural blood flow was noted in control animals during reperfusion, resulting in a significant reduction at 3 hours compared with the preocclusion value (0.69 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g [at baseline versus 0.45 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p less than 0.05]). In contrast, flow in adenosine animals at 3 hours was similar to baseline values (0.91 +/- 0.15 ml/min/g at baseline versus 0.98 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p = NS) and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the control group. Radial shortening in the ischemic zone was significantly improved at 3 (-2.6 +/- 2.8% in controls versus 11.6 +/- 3.3% in treated animals, p less than 0.01) and 72 hours (5.5 +/- 2.0% in controls versus 17.3 +/- 3.5% in treated animals, p less than 0.01) after reperfusion in treated animals.

  ".U": "91084958\r", 
  ".W": "Although findings from several reports suggest that nonreentrant or focal mechanisms contribute to the genesis of arrhythmias during early ischemia, the contribution of triggered activity arising from early or delayed afterdepolarizations has not been resolved. We have previously demonstrated that beta- but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation induces afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in isolated normoxic myocytes. In the present study, the influence of the extent of cellular derangements as well as increases in [K+]o on alpha- and beta-adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity was evaluated. Adult canine myocytes were exposed to one of the following experimental conditions with simultaneous intracellular transmembrane action potential recordings: 1) low PO2 (less than 10 mm Hg, obtained using a specially designed hypoxic chamber) and low (6.8) pH; 2) low PO2, low pH, and high extracellular potassium ([K+]o) (10 mM); or 3) severe metabolic inhibition with cyanide (10(-6) M). Cells from each group were superfused with either the alpha-agonist phenylephrine (10(-5) or 10(-7) M, with 10(-5) M nadolol) or the beta-agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Moderate changes in the action potentials were observed under conditions 1 and 2 (moderate hypoxia), whereas marked but reversible changes were observed with cyanide (severe metabolic inhibition). During moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o, delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered activity were elicited by both alpha- (12 of 13 cells) and beta-adrenergic (five of five cells) stimulation. Increasing [K+]o during moderate hypoxia completely abolished the afterdepolarizations induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation and prevented the occurrence of triggered activity. In contrast, the influence of beta-adrenergic stimulation was only attenuated by an increase in [K+]o. Exposure to cyanide completely prevented the induction of afterdepolarizations and triggered activity by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings indicate that moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o is associated with the development of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In contrast, accumulation of [K+]o or severe impairment of cellular metabolism is accompanied by inhibition of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between ventricular dysfunction arising from myocardial fibrosis and ischemic, but viable, myocardium has important clinical implications. By positron emission tomography (PET), enhanced fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myocardial segments with impaired function and reduced blood flow is evidence of myocardial viability. Reinjection of thallium-201 at rest immediately after stress-redistribution imaging may also provide evidence of myocardial viability by demonstrating thallium uptake in regions with apparently \"irreversible\" defects. To compare these two methods, we studied 16 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 27 +/- 9%), all of whom had irreversible defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Thallium was reinjected immediately after the redistribution study, and SPECT images were reacquired. The patients also underwent PET imaging with FDG and oxygen-15-labeled water. A total of 432 myocardial segments were analyzed from comparable transaxial tomograms, of which 166 (38%) had irreversible thallium defects on redistribution images before reinjection. FDG uptake was demonstrated in 121 (73%) of these irreversible defects. Irreversible defects were then subgrouped according to the degree of thallium activity, relative to peak activity in normal regions. Irreversible defects with only mild (60-85% of peak activity) or moderate (50-59% of peak) reduction in thallium activity were considered viable on the basis of FDG uptake in 91% and 84% of these segments, respectively. In contrast, in irreversible defects with severe reduction in thallium activity (less than 50% of peak), FDG uptake was present in 51% of segments. In such severe defects, an identical number of segments (51%) demonstrated enhanced uptake of thallium after reinjection. In these severe \"irreversible\" defects, data on myocardial viability were concordant by the two techniques in 88% of segments, with 45% identified as viable and 43% identified as scar on both PET and thallium reinjection studies. These observations suggest that thallium imaging can be used to identify viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Most irreversible defects with only mild or moderate reduction in thallium activity represent viable myocardium as confirmed by FDG uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was determined by the slopes of linear regression of pulse interval versus the preceding systolic arterial pressure in response to bolus injections of either phenylephrine or nitroglycerin. BRS was significantly depressed in the heart failure state [nitroglycerin slope, 5.0 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- SD) versus 16.6 +/- 5.1 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.005; phenylephrine slope, 15.0 +/- 14.8 versus 32.0 +/- 26.7 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.005]. There was no depression in BRS in dogs that were used as time controls or were acutely paced for 30 minutes. After beta 1-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol, the resting heart rate in the heart failure state was depressed more than in the normal state (-17.0 +/- 5.0% versus -3.2 +/- 3.4%, p less than 0.001). Atropine significantly increased resting heart rate more in the normal state than in the heart failure state (115.8 +/- 36.7% versus 25.4 +/- 14.5%, p less than 0.005). Thus, dogs in the heart failure state appear to have high resting cardiac sympathetic tone and low resting vagal tone. For nitroglycerin administration, metoprolol depressed BRS by 47.6 +/- 26.3% in the normal state and by 63.6 +/- 58.5% in the heart failure state. Atropine decreased the BRS by 86.7 +/- 7.8% in the normal state and by 39.5 +/- 30.2% in the heart failure state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiological mechanism by which a short-long-short stimulated cardiac sequence facilitates the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia was investigated in dogs 4 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In these dogs, reentry develops in the surviving electrophysiologically abnormal epicardial layer that overlies the infarct zone when premature stimulation results in a critically long arc of functional conduction block. The activation wavefront circulates around both ends of the arc, coalesces, and conducts slowly distal to the arc before reactivating sites proximal to the arc to initiate a figure-eight reentrant circuit. Epicardial isochronal activation maps and effective refractory periods (ERPs) were determined during three different stimulation protocols: A, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec followed by a single premature stimulus (S2); B, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec with abrupt lengthening of the last cycle of the train before S2 to 600 msec; C, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 600 msec followed by S2. Protocol B was found to result in a differential lengthening of ERP at adjacent sites within the border of the epicardial ischemic zone, whereas protocols A and C induced, respectively, comparable shortening and lengthening of ERPs at the same sites. The differential lengthening of ERPs at adjacent sites resulted in an increased dispersion of refractoriness so that a premature stimulus induced functional conduction block between those sites. The development of a longer arc of conduction block and, hence, a longer reentrant pathway as well as slower conduction of the circulating wavefront during protocol B allowed more time for refractoriness to expire proximal to the arc and for the circulating wavefront to reexcite those sites to initiate reentry. The lengthening of ERP, associated with a single long cycle (protocol B), ranged from 44% to 79% of the total increase in ERP after a series of eight long cycles (protocol C). Epicardial sites with longer ERPs located close to the center of the ischemic zone showed more lengthening of refractoriness during protocol B compared with more normal sites near the border of the ischemic zone. This strongly suggests that the increased dispersion of refractoriness during protocol B is caused by the shorter memory of ischemic myocardium to the cumulative effects of preceding cycle lengths.\r"

  ".W": "DC shocks within the coronary sinus have been abandoned because of the risk of cardiac rupture and tamponade. Catheter ablation using DC energy to electrodes straddling the ostium of the coronary sinus, when used clinically, has been reported to result in cardiac tamponade in as many as 16% of patients. A new system of energy delivery maximizes voltage while decreasing the undesirable effects caused by barotrauma. This system includes 1) a low-energy ablation power supply with a brief time-constant capacitive discharge that delivers up to 40 J and 3,000 V and 2) a low-energy ablation catheter with a contoured distal electrode. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies of this new system and compared arcing shocks with nonarcing shocks. Ablations were performed using unipolar distal shocks (D) and unipolar shocks to both electrodes made electrically common (P-D). In vitro studies were done in a large tank filled with physiological saline while recording voltage, current, and pressure. High-speed cinematography (32,000 frames/sec) of shocks of 10-40 J permitted detailed analysis of the vapor globe. Anodal shocks of less than 20 J showed no arcing or only minimal vapor globe formation. For D and P-D anodal shocks of 40 J, the diameters of the vapor globe were 31 and 22 mm, respectively, corresponding to pressure recordings of 11 and 4.9 atm. The pressure rise lasted less than 50 mu sec. In vivo studies involved 18 dogs that received nonarcing shocks (one to six shocks of 15 J) and 18 dogs that received arcing shocks (one to three shocks of 40 J). Each group was divided between D and P-D shocks; catheter ablation was performed at a mean +/- SEM distance of 2.94 +/- 0.92 cm within the coronary sinus. All dogs tolerated the procedure without cardiac rupture or tamponade. When killed 2-4 days later, the dogs had edema and hyperemia or hemorrhage in the area of the coronary sinus. We compared the effects of multiple (three to six) nonarcing shocks with the effects of one to three arcing shocks. Disruption or rupture of the coronary sinus within the epicardial fat space occurred in two of 12 dogs (17%) with multiple nonarcing shocks but in 13 of 18 dogs (72%) with arcing shocks (p less than 0.003). Occlusion of the coronary sinus occurred in two of 12 dogs (17%) with multiple nonarcing shocks and in nine of 18 dogs (50%) with arcing shocks (p less than 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate coronary flow reserve during cardiac catheterization, intracoronary adenosine and papaverine have been used in the clinical setting. Although papaverine maximizes coronary blood flow, it induces several toxic side effects that reduce its desirability as a coronary dilator. This investigation was designed to compare the subselective intracoronary administration of papaverine with that of adenosine in an animal model. In dogs (n = 34), we studied the effects of each agent on hemodynamics, regional myocardial blood flow, contractility (sonomicrometric and echocardiographic), metabolism (coronary arterial and venous lactate and tissue high-energy phosphates), and electrocardiographic (ST and QT intervals) parameters. Barbiturate and morphine anesthesia/analgesia was induced, and a left thoracotomy was performed. An arterial shunt was created from the left carotid artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery. Two separate groups were studied: group 1 (n = 16) for regional myocardial blood flow and mechanical function and group 2 (n = 18) for biochemical measurements. Adenosine (67 +/- 2 micrograms/min) or papaverine (6 +/- 1 mg/min) was infused into the coronary shunt at a rate of 0.5 + 0.1 ml/min for a maximum duration of 3.5 minutes. Regional myocardial blood flows were determined at control (predrug) and maximal coronary flow using radiolabeled microspheres. All hemodynamic, wall motion, biochemical, and electrocardiographic parameters were also measured at these times. Both drugs produced comparable increases in total and regional coronary blood flows (adenosine, 1.21 +/- 0.15 to 4.83 +/- 0.36 ml/min/g; papaverine, 1.21 +/- 0.05 to 4.89 +/- 0.28 ml/min/g) upon infusion into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Papaverine produced significant (p less than 0.05) changes in subendocardial ST segment electrocardiogram (-2.5 mm), QT prolongation (8 +/- 2%), myocardial creatine phosphate (47% decrease), and coronary sinus serum lactate (277% increase) compared with control. In addition, intracoronary papaverine induced an abnormal contractile pattern. No significant changes in any of these parameters (i.e., ST segment, QT prolongation, myocardial creatine phosphate level, or lactate level) were observed with intracoronary adenosine infusions. We conclude that intracoronary adenosine is comparable to papaverine for maximizing coronary blood flow without the deleterious properties observed with intracoronary papaverine.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether pressure-volume areas (PVAs) calculated using the maximum time-varying elastance (Emax) have a relation with myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) that improves on other indexes of myocardial oxygen demand, we studied nine dogs of either sex weighing 19-39 kg, which were instrumented with a micromanometer left ventricular (LV) catheter and a Wilton-Webster coronary sinus flow catheter and had red blood cells tagged with technetium-99m for radionuclide angiography. Hemodynamics, coronary sinus flow determinations, and radionuclide angiograms were obtained under control conditions and during three to five steady-state loading conditions (mean +/- SD, 5.6 +/- 0.7). Isochronal pressure-volume data points from each pressure-volume loop were subjected to linear regression analysis to calculate Emax. The Emax relations, diastolic curves, and systolic portions of each pressure-volume loop were used to obtain calibrated PVAs. The Emax PVA (mm Hg.ml.beat-1.100 g-1) and MVO2 (ml O2.beat-1.100 g-1) values correlated in each animal (r = 0.77 to 0.99). Their slopes averaged (3.48 +/- 1.68) x 10(-5) ml O2.mm Hg-1.ml-1, and their y-axis intercepts averaged 0.07 +/- 0.04 ml O2.beat-1.100 g-1. When the MVO2 relations were compared with Emax PVA, LV systolic pressure-rate product, LV stroke work, and a modification of the LV pressure-work index, the Emax PVA, LV systolic pressure-rate product, and LV pressure-work index had similar relations with MVO2, whereas LV stroke work was a weaker index of MVO2 (p less than 0.05 versus Emax PVA). This occurred because the Emax PVA:MVO2 slopes and y-axis intercepts differed in each dog, which was due to differences in basal LV contractility. The Emax PVA:MVO2 slopes correlated with Emax (r = 0.73, p less than 0.05), and the y-axis intercepts were also weakly related to Emax (r = 0.48, p = 0.19). We conclude that the Emax PVAs calculated using data acquisition techniques that are clinically applicable have relations with MVO2 that in general do not improve on other indexes of myocardial oxygen demand in this animal preparation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of mechanical changes in loading conditions on the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) were studied in nine open-chest dogs, including three dogs studied before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Left ventricular pressure was measured with a micromanometer, and left ventricular volume was measured with a conductance catheter. ESPVRs were obtained by increasing left atrial inflow over wide volume ranges (as much as threefold) under three different conditions: control or high or low aortic impedance. High impedance was obtained by occlusion of the descending aorta, and low impedance was obtained by a shunt between the subclavian artery and the left atrium. In the unblocked animals in 21 of 28 runs, a second-order polynomial equation gave a better fit for the ESPVR than a linear relation. To quantify the effects of the changes in aortic impedance on the ESPVR, we calculated from the quadratic equation its volume intercept (V18) and its local slope (E18) at an end-systolic pressure (Pes) of 18 kPa. In the unblocked animals, a statistically significant difference was found in V18 between low impedance (21.50 +/- 6.27 ml) and high impedance (14.10 +/- 8.98 ml; p less than 0.005) and between control (19.14 +/- 9.58 ml) and high impedance (p less than 0.05). In most dogs, E18 was increased at high and decreased at low impedance, but not significantly. In the additional experiments with beta-blockade, the nonlinearity diminished somewhat, but the load dependency of the ESPVR remained present after beta-blockade because the same leftward shift of the ESPVR with high aortic impedance was found. Two other relations, namely, of dP/dtmax and of stroke work versus end-diastolic volume, were also investigated, which on the whole showed the same behavior as the ESPVR. These results indicate that the ESPVR and dP/dtmax-Ved and stroke work-end-diastolic volume relations, when studied over a wide volume range, are nonlinear and that changes in loading conditions influence indexes of contractility derived from these relations, especially the volume intercepts, in such a way that an increase in aortic impedance may be interpreted as an increase in contractility. Blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors did not influence the load dependency of the ESPVR but, in some cases, tended to decrease the nonlinearity in concordance with the relation between contractility and nonlinearity in isolated hearts.\r"
