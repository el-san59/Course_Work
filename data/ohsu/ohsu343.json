The patients received a standard anaesthetic and were allocated randomly to either group immediately before intubation. Fibreoptic intubation took significantly longer to perform. There were significant increases in heart rate and arterial pressure in both groups compared with pre-induction values. The tachycardia in the fibreoptic group was significantly greater than that in the control group during the second minute after intubation, and the increase in systolic pressure was sustained for a longer period in the fibreoptic group. The maximum increases in systolic and diastolic pressures above pre-intubation values were significantly greater in the fibreoptic group. The cardiovascular responses associated with fibreoptic intubation under general anaesthesia appear to be more severe than those which follow intubation effected with a Macintosh laryngoscope.\r"

Spread was more extensive in cadavers, probably as a result of autolysis. It would therefore still appear necessary, when low volumes of local anaesthetic are used, to block each intercostal nerve individually.\r"

Mean (SD) peak venous bupivacaine concentrations were 0.57 (0.17) microgram/ml and 0.79 (0.38) microgram/ml respectively. Time to peak plasma concentrations were 29.6 (7.9) and 22.3 (10.9) minutes respectively. These concentrations are well below the potentially toxic level of 4.0 micrograms/ml, but suggest that uptake of bupivacaine is more rapid after ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block than during caudal analgesia.\r"

Plastic tubes became stiffer when chilled, had greater resistance to reshaping and were more sensitive to shock and manipulation. They also need protection against cold and shock during transport. Rubber tubes were more tolerant of cold stress. Very cold rubber and plastic tubes may induce tissue damage. Rewarming to a nondangerous temperature was shown to be a quick procedure. It is suggested that the rescuer's own body heat be used.\r"

Fourteen of the 22 charts omitted important headings concerned with patient identification and eight charts did not provide a record of the whole perioperative period. Some comprehensive forms are in use, chiefly in smaller hospitals, but there have been few changes in design in the last 10 years despite increasing medicolegal awareness.\r"

  ".W": "The hypoxic mouse model, in which mice are subjected to an atmosphere of 5% O2 in nitrogen, has been used to screen anesthetics for possible cerebral protection by measuring their ability to prolong survival in mice exposed to hypoxia. Although prolonged survival time in this model is primarily due to a decreased cerebral metabolic rate produced by a specific anesthetic, results can also be influenced by body temperature, dose of anesthetic, and ventilatory or circulatory depression produced by the anesthetic. Using the hypoxic mouse model, the effects of thiopental in conjunction with changes in ambient temperature, changes in thiopental dose, and the presence or absence of nitrous oxide (N2O) were examined. Survival times were measured in eight groups of animals, either untreated animals or animals pretreated with 100 mg/kg thiopental intraperitoneally; exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of N2O; at ambient temperatures of either 25 degrees C or 35.5 degrees C. Survival times of seven additional groups of mice, either untreated or treated with doses of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 120 mg/kg thiopental intraperitoneally, exposed to hypoxia in an ambient temperature of 35.5 degrees C were measured to determine a dose-response curve. At an ambient temperature of 35.5 degrees C in which the rectal temperature of both untreated and thiopental-treated animals was maintained near 36 degrees C, thiopental-treated animals did not survive any longer than the untreated animals. Exposure to N2O shortened survival times of both groups by approximately 20%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of hepatic energy deficits in the pathogenesis of anesthetic hepatotoxicity is suggested by the involvement of hypoxia in various animal models and by the ability of anesthetics to inhibit mitochondrial oxidations. We have been studying anesthetic effects on hepatocellular energy metabolism using suspensions of intact hepatocytes freshly isolated from phenobarbital-treated or untreated rats (+PB or -PB cells, respectively), an experimental system that is metabolically complete yet also biochemically homogeneous and accessible. In the present work, diazepam, lidocaine, thiopental, and enflurane, as well as the combination of thiopental and enflurane, were studied at concentrations similar to those achieved in vivo. Thiopental increased cellular oxygen consumption rate (VO2) in both +PB and -PB cells significantly, as did aminopyrine, a test substrate for PB-inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Diazepam increased VO2 only in +PB cells, as did enflurane, whereas lidocaine did not increase VO2 in either +PB or -PB cells. The combination of thiopental and enflurane significantly decreased VO2 in -PB cells but increased it in +PB cells. The higher VO2 in +PB cells compared to -PB cells, seen with all drugs tested (except lidocaine), was eliminated by prior addition of the P450 inhibitor metyrapone. Starting from steady states of oxygen metabolism, with VO2 offset by O2 supply from an overlying gas phase and PO2 stabilized at 24 mm Hg, aminopyrine significantly lowered extracellular PO2, increased lactate production, and decreased high energy phosphate levels within 10 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, myocardial oxygen consumption, glucose utilization, lactate production, tissue content of glycogen, adenine nucleotides, and creatine phosphate content were measured. The relative potency of bupivacaine to lidocaine, calculated from slopes of regression equations, as indicated by the four mechanical variables and oxygen consumption, was 4.59. When the bupivacaine concentration was \"normalized\" using this value, bupivacaine and lidocaine showed indistinguishable effects on glucose utilization, lactate production, and tissue glycogen. Neither of the local anesthetics had any influence on energy charge or creatine phosphate content.\r"

  ".W": "Global and regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism were examined in 20 patients with coronary artery disease before surgical stimulation. Half were anesthetized with halothane (0.8%) and half with isoflurane (1.2%). Coronary perfusion pressure decreased similarly in both groups. During halothane anesthesia coronary sinus blood flow, an index of global perfusion, decreased from an awake value of 129 +/- 7 to 97 +/- 7 ml/min (P less than 0.05), and great cardiac vein blood flow, an index of regional perfusion, decreased from 60 +/- 8 to 44 +/- 5 ml/min (P less than 0.05). In contrast, during isoflurane anesthesia global coronary blood flow increased from 131 +/- 13 to 153 +/- 16 ml/min (P less than 0.05), while regional blood flow decreased from 68 +/- 7 to 56 +/- 6 ml/min (P less than 0.05). Thus, the ratio of great cardiac vein blood flow to coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during halothane anesthesia but decreased significantly during isoflurane. Neither global nor regional coronary vascular resistance was altered by halothane, whereas isoflurane decreased global coronary vascular resistance without affecting regional coronary vascular resistance. All patients receiving halothane had net myocardial lactate extraction. In the isoflurane group, four patients showed global lactate production and three regional lactate production. All patients demonstrating lactate production also developed electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia, which was not present before induction. The authors conclude that halothane is a preferable anesthetic to isoflurane in patients with coronary artery disease because the latter has the propensity to induce maldistribution of the coronary circulation and myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Some investigators have postulated a synergistic analgesic effect of local anesthetic agents and opiates when given intrathecally or epidurally, but little objective evidence has been presented to quantitate such an effect. A study was therefore undertaken to compare in mice the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal injections of mixtures of morphine with bupivacaine or lidocaine with the effects of these agents when administered alone. The antinociceptive effects (tail-flick and hotp-late tests) of morphine (0.1-1.6 micrograms) with either bupivacaine, 25 micrograms, or lidocaine, 200 micrograms, were significantly greater than the effects of morphine or the local anesthetics when administered alone. When morphine was administered with the local anesthetics, the intensity and the duration of antinociception were greater, although the time courses of the effects resembled that of morphine administered alone. An enhanced effect was also observed when combinations of local anesthetics and low doses of morphine were used that by themselves had no or little effect. The addition of morphine did not affect the motor block produced by the local anesthetics. The results indicate a potentiating effect of local anesthetics on spinal morphine antinociception, a finding that may have important clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "A conscious dog model was used to study pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine after a short infusion (SI) (15 min) and a prolonged infusion (PI) (24 hours). Bupivacaine was infused in six mongrel dogs at least 10 days after implantation of femoral arterial and venous catheters. Each dog received both the SI and the PI in a random crossover design at a one week interval. Bupivacaine concentration was measured in serum sampled during the SI, during the last hour of the PI, and at frequent intervals during eight hours after cessation of infusion. Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance also was measured during the last hour of the PI and 90 min after cessation of both the SI and the PI. The terminal half-life (T1/2Z) of bupivacaine increased after the PI compared with the SI, 167 +/- 86 vs 53 +/- 13 min, respectively (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05), and total body clearance (Cl) decreased, 3.4 +/- 1.2 vs 9.5 +/- 4.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, (P less than 0.05), although the volumes of distribution (VZ and VSS) did not change. A decrease in hepatic blood flow did not cause the decrease in Cl because ICG clearance did not change during the three sets of measurements. Thus, the observed increase in T1/2Z and decrease in Cl after the PI as compared with the SI are due to a decrease in hepatic intrinsic clearance of bupivacaine. Differences in the kinetic profile of the two enantiomers of bupivacaine cannot be excluded as a cause. We conclude that the extrapolation of kinetic data of bupivacaine obtained after a short infusion (or a bolus injection) to prolonged dosage must be done with care.\r"

Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) was monitored throughout the first postoperative hour in 164 patients. The patients breathed room air during recovery. Supplemental oxygen was given only to those who became hypoxemic (SpO2 less than or equal to 92%). It was discontinued at the end of 15 minutes and reinstituted for another 15 minutes if hypoxemia recurred. Twelve patients (7%) became hypoxemic and required supplemental oxygen for various periods of time up to 105 minutes. The need for supplemental oxygen increased with increasing age (P less than 0.05) but was not associated with a history of cigarette smoking, tracheal intubation, amount of opioids or sedatives given intraoperatively, anesthetic duration, or level of consciousness during recovery. Hypoxemia was neither predictable nor clinically apparent. We recommend that, unless arterial oxygenation is monitored, ambulatory patients should routinely receive supplemental oxygen during recovery from general anesthesia.\r"

In each subject, epidural fentanyl was given by a bolus dose of 1 microgram.kg-1, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 microgram.kg-1.h-1 over 18 hours. Ventilatory measurements were performed during quiet breathing and during CO2 stimulation tests before surgery. After surgery measurements were made before epidural administration of fentanyl; 1, 2, 5, 18 hours after the start of epidural fentanyl infusion; and 6 hours after its discontinuation. Adequate pain relief was achieved in all patients during fentanyl administration. No significant change in ventilation was noted during quiet breathing. The slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 (VE/PaCO2) decreased significantly from 1.46 +/- 0.2 to 0.75 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.mm Hg-1 (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0.05) one hour after the onset of fentanyl administration, and remained stable throughout the infusion. Eighteen hours after the onset of epidural fentanyl infusion, VE/PaCO2 was still 0.76 +/- 0.14 L.min-1.mm Hg-1. At the end of fentanyl administration, plasma fentanyl levels measured in six patients had progressively increased from 0.42 +/- 0.02 ng.ml one hour after the onset of the infusion to 1.54 +/- 0.19 ng.ml at the end of the infusion. These results suggest that a continuous epidural administration of fentanyl is a technique of analgesia that can provide adequate pain relief but which is associated with ventilatory depression. However, with the doses used in this study, the ventilatory depression remained moderate and of no demonstrable clinical consequence.\r"

Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the putative excitatory afferent transmitter substance P and the mu and delta receptor agonist (Met)enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 were measured during general anesthesia for abdominal surgery and during the postoperative period when patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used for control of pain. The CSF was sampled through an intrathecal catheter. Seven of the patients were randomly assigned to receive neurolept anesthesia; the rest were given isoflurane anesthesia without narcotics. No statistically significant changes occurred in substance P concentrations in CSF during surgery or postoperative PCA, nor were there significant differences between the two groups. There was, however, a significant correlation between CSF substance P concentrations before the start of PCA and pain assessment on a visual analogue scale. The individual changes in substance P concentrations during PCA was also inversely correlated to the consumption of meperidine. The CSF (Met)enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 concentrations were below the level of detection in seven of the patients before anesthesia. A large interindividual variability in both substance P and (Met)enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 concentrations was evident. The absence of major changes in CSF neuropeptide concentrations was unexpected. Apparently inter-individual variations in neuropeptide output are considerable.\r"

  ".W": "Although high pressure is often viewed as a nonspecific stimulus counteracting anesthesia, pressure can either excite or inhibit biological activity depending on the temperature at application. Temperature and pressure are two independent variables that determine equilibrium quantity, e.g., the state of organisms in terms of activity and anesthesia depth. We used the light intensity of luminous bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) as an activity parameter, and studied the effects of pressure and anesthetics on the bacteria's light intensity at various temperatures. The light intensity was greatest at about 30 degrees C at ambient pressure. When the system was pressurized up to 204 atm, the temperature for maximum light intensity was shifted to higher temperatures. Above the optimal temperature for the maximal light intensity, high pressure increased the light intensity. Below the optimal temperature, pressure decreased light intensity. Pressure only shifts the reaction equilibrium to the lower volume state (Le Chatelier's principle). When the volume of the excited state is larger than the resting state, high pressure inhibits excitation, and vice versa. Halothane 0.008 atm and isoflurane 0.021 atm inhibited the light intensity both above and below the optimal temperature. When pressurized, the light intensity increased in the high temperature range but decreased in the low temperature range, as in the control. Thus, high pressure seemingly potentiated the anesthetic action at low temperatures. When the ratio of the light intensity in bacteria exposed to anesthesia and those not exposed to anesthesia was plotted against the pressure, however, the value approached unity in proportion to the pressure increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinic/office (casual), home (self), and twenty-four-hour ambulatory (ABP) blood pressure determinations were compared in 32 subjects defined by conventional office criteria as mild or borderline hypertensives. Office diastolic blood pressures (mean 93.1 +/- 5.3 mmHg) were significantly higher than either home (mean 88.9 +/- 7.1 mm Hg) or awake ABP (mean 88.4 +/- 8.4 mm Hg) readings for the total group, as well as for the mild hypertension subgroup (office mean 96.0 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, home mean 91.0 +/- 8.0, awake ABP mean 90.4 +/- 8.8) but not for the borderline subgroup. In the total study group, office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) correlated better with home DBP (r = 0.58, p = 0.0005), than with the awake ABP (r = 0.40, p = 0.02). Home DBP correlated well with awake DBP (r = 0.48, p = 0.006). In subgroup analysis, office DBPs correlated well with home (self) readings for both the mild (r = 0.53, p = 0.03) and the borderline (r = 0.62, p = 0.01) subgroups. When office DBPs were compared with awake ABP DBPs, the correlation coefficient for the mild subgroup was significant (r = 0.49, p = 0.04); this was not the case for the borderline subgroup (r = 0.10, p = NS). Comparison of home (self) DBPs with awake ABP determinations revealed a good correlation for the borderline subgroup (r = 0.63, p = 0.01) but not for the mild subgroup (r = 0.35, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the pulmonary hemodynamics in primary pulmonary hypertension, the relation between the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulmonary hemodynamics as determined by right-heart catheterization was analyzed. Significant positive correlations were noted between amplitude of the R in V1, the R/S ratio in V1, and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.46 and 0.50, respectively, p less than 0.01). An amplitude of the R in V1 of more than 1.2 mV indicated a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of more than 90 mmHg with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 47%. The cardiac index showed a significant positive relationship with amplitude of the R in V5 and V6 and the R/S ratio in V5 and V6 (r = 0.46, 0.46, 0.39, and 0.48, respectively; each with a p less than 0.01). Moreover, an AQRS greater than or equal to 100 degrees, and either an SV6 greater than or equal to 0.7 mV, or R/SV6 less than or equal to 2 indicated a cardiac index of less than 2.8L/min/m2 with a sensitivity of 82% and 84% and a specificity of 86% and 100% respectively. This study suggests, therefore, that the 12-lead ECG is useful for the evaluation of the severity of pulmonary hypertension by its ability to predict pulmonary artery systolic pressure and cardiac index with clinically useful accuracy.\r"

Only 1 patient had to be excluded owing to a technically inadequate Doppler examination. Data for comparison were obtained from a right heart catheterization performed within a twenty-four-hour interval from the Doppler study. Sensitivity and specificity in the detection of the lesion were 88% and 100%, respectively. A previously undescribed pulsed Doppler method for the estimation of the degree of TR was tested, based on the consideration of two distinctive patterns of the regurgitant Doppler signal: type I: a protosystolic regurgitant signal with progressively fading intensity along systole; and type II: a homogeneously intense pansystolic signal. Correlation between these patterns and the angiographic degrees of TR showed that milder lesions correspond to the type I Doppler pattern, whereas significant regurgitations present a type II pattern, this allowing a clinically useful method of assessment of TR.\r"

Hemodynamic variables were determined over a one-hour control period, following which the randomized dose of atenolol was administered and measurements repeated at 15 (intravenous therapy only), 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes. The peak hemodynamic effect was similar and independent of either the dosage or route of administration. In all groups atenolol reduced heart rate and cardiac and stroke volume indices. The pulmonary artery occluded pressure and systemic vascular resistance index were transiently increased. Mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced only in the oral group with the highest pretreatment pressure. Maximum changes developed between fifteen and thirty minutes after intravenous dosing and between two and three hours after oral dosing. However, substantial reductions in cardiac index (-0.6 L/min/m2; p less than 0.05) were already achieved at sixty minutes following oral dosing. The duration of pharmacodynamic activity was for two to three hours following intravenous and for the study duration (four to six hours) after oral dosing. These data confirm the hemodynamic safety of atenolol after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

With strain gauge plethysmography, simultaneous changes in the digital total (DTF) flow were also measured. After exposure of fingers to cold, 25 of 26 subjects had a clear reduction in both DTF and the AVA patency rate (APR) in comparison with the corresponding heat values. The RP patients, in particular, showed a statistically significant reduction in DTF (P less than 0.001) and in APR (P less than 0.001). These results appear to be consistent with the onset of critically reduced patency of the AVA of the hand during the ischemic phase of RP.\r"

  ".W": "Under certain conditions laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) signals obtained from the finger pulp may appear very similar to those obtained by use of a direct current (dc) photoplethysmograph (PPG). A combined LDF/PPG system was used in conjunction with a circumference strain gauge as an index of volume change to identify the conditions in which the correlation between these signals was good. Simultaneous LDF and dc PPG measurements were made on 10 normal volunteers by using arterial occlusion and on 7 normal subjects by using the Valsalva maneuver at different elevations of the forearm and hand with respect to the midsternum. By altering the elevation of the upper limb the influence of venous filling on each of the signals during these maneuvers was observed. Since the dc PPG signal always appeared similar to the volume change indicated by the circumference strain gauge, it is concluded that the dc PPG signal is related to blood volume change if allowance is made for the effects of blood oxygenation. In circumstances of low venous filling, however, blood volume changes correlate well with blood flow changes, producing the correlation between the dc PPG and LDF traces. The dc PPG signal may be used as a means of monitoring changes in blood flow in the finger only when venous filling is low and the return remains unrestricted. Thus, in investigations using this method, the relative position of the limb with respect to the heart should always be indicated. The LDF method appears to be a reliable indicator of blood flow changes in the microcirculation irrespective of the degree of venous filling.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, prospective phase II trial. SETTING: Tertiary referral university hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-six of fifty-eight entered patients with measurable and progressive recurrent germ cell tumors of testicular (46 patients), ovarian (1 patient), and extragonadal (9 patients) origin were evaluable for response after not being cured with cisplatin, vinblastine, and etoposide regimens. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were administered cisplatin (20 mg/m2 body surface area daily for 5 days), ifosfamide (1.2 g daily for 5 days), plus either etoposide (75 mg daily for 5 days) or vinblastine (0.11 mg/kg body weight on days 1 and 2). In addition, vigorous intravenous hydration therapy with normal saline (100 to 125 mL/h) was administered during the treatment course. Uroepithelial protective agents, N-acetylcysteine (orally) or mesna (intravenously), were administered. Four courses were administered to responding patients every 3 weeks. When complete excision was feasible, surgical resection of residual tumor was done approximately 6 to 8 weeks after chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twelve of fifty-six evaluable patients had a complete remission with chemotherapy alone, whereas 8 additional patients were free of disease after resection of teratoma (3 patients) or carcinoma (5 patients) for a total disease-free rate of 36% (95% CI, 23.4 to 49.6). The 95% CI median duration of remission for these patients is 34 months (range, 3 to more than 42; 95% CI, 9 months to infinity), and the median survival for all eligible patients is 12.7 months (95% CI, 10 months to 26 months), with 15 of the 20 patients who achieved disease-free status alive 18 to 53 months or more. Nine of fifty-eight patients remain free of disease, including 7 patients for 2 years or longer. Hematologic and nephrotoxicity were the predominant drug-related toxicities, with one drug-related death secondary to pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Ifosfamide combination chemotherapy as third-line or greater therapy can produce durable complete remissions in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent germ cell tumors.\r"

PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with a pathologically-confirmed diagnosis of the adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing syndrome had 131I-6-beta-iodomethylnorcholesterol scintigraphy and, in most cases, computed tomography. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using 131I-6-beta-iodomethylnorcholesterol scintigraphy, adenomas were accurately seen as focal, unilateral tracer uptake in 14 of 14 patients. In carcinoma, the classic scintigraphic pattern of bilateral nonvisualization was observed in 3 of 4 patients, with ipsilateral uptake of tracer in 1 patient with a histologically well-differentiated malignancy. Computed tomography done during the same interval depicted abnormal adrenals in all cases of adenoma and carcinoma. In cortical nodular hyperplasia, however, computed tomography identified abnormal pairs of adrenals in only one of four cases studied, whereas scintigraphy showed typical patterns of bilateral increased uptake in all of the cases. CONCLUSION: 131I-6-beta-iodomethylnorcholesterol scintigraphy accurately shows the location and nature of adrenal dysfunction in the adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing syndrome and may be particularly useful in identifying the bilateral adrenal involvement in cortical nodular hyperplasia.\r"

We have developed a new method to investigate this issue and have reviewed 182 deaths from 12 hospitals (6 high outliers and 6 low outliers for death rate) for three conditions (cerebrovascular accident, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction). The investigators prepared a dictated summary of each patient's hospital course. Then, at least three physicians reviewed each summary and independently judged whether the death could have been prevented. Using a majority rules criterion (at least two of three physicians agreed), we found that 27% of the deaths might have been prevented. Using a unanimity criterion (all three physicians independently agreed), we found a 14% rate of probably preventable deaths. Patients whose deaths were probably preventable were younger (74.7 compared with 78.6 years, P less than 0.05), less often demented (12% compared with 26%, P less than 0.05), and less severely ill (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, 15.6 compared with 21.2; P less than 0.001) than patients whose deaths were nonpreventable. The physicians also listed causes for each probably preventable death; nine reasons encompassed almost all of them. For myocardial infarction, preventable deaths reflected errors in management. For cerebrovascular accident, however, deaths primarily reflected errors in diagnosis. The severity of illness can help a hospital retrospectively identify probably preventable deaths. In the group of patients who died, 42% of those with a low severity of illness had probably preventable deaths as compared to 11% admitted with a high severity of illness. We found that a significant number of hospital deaths might have been prevented. Our findings were based on a new method that needs further testing to substantiate its validity. These findings also need replication before they can be generalized to other hospitals.\r"

DESIGN: Case series of patients with incidentally discovered unilateral, euadrenal masses. SETTING: Referral-based nuclear medicine clinics at university and affiliated Veterans Administration medical centers. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 119 euadrenal patients with unilateral adrenal masses discovered on computed tomographic (CT) scans for reasons other than suspected adrenal disease. INTERVENTIONS: Adrenal scintiscans done using 1 mCi of NP-59 intravenously, and gamma camera imaging 5 to 7 days later. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean lesion diameter was 3.3 +/- 1.9 cm (SD) (95% CI: 2.9 to 3.6 cm). In 76 patients, NP-59 uptake lateralized to the abnormal adrenal seen on CT scans (concordant imaging), and in all of these patients, a diagnosis of adenoma was made by needle-aspiration biopsy, adrenalectomy, or extended follow-up with repeat CT scans that were unchanged at 6 months or later. Twenty-six patients had absent or markedly reduced NP-59 uptake in the glands identified as abnormal on CT scans (discordant imaging). These adrenal masses proved to be metastatic malignancies in 19 patients, primary adrenal neoplasms other than adenoma in 4, and adrenal cysts in 3. Bilateral, symmetric accumulation of NP-59 was seen in 17 patients, in whom the adrenal masses were shown to be metastatic malignancies in 2, and adenomas in 6 (the lesions in these cases being 2 cm or less in diameter), and lesions not truly involving the adrenal in the rest (periadrenal metastases in 4 and pseudoadrenal masses in 5). Sensitivity was 76% (26 of 34 patients; CI, 58% to 88%); specificity, 100% (85 of 85 patients; CI, 95% to 100%), and accuracy, 93% (111 of 119 patients: CI, 88% to 98%). CONCLUSIONS: Functional NP-59 scintigraphy can be used to accurately and noninvasively characterize many euadrenal masses; concordance of CT and NP-59 scans can be used to exclude the presence of a malignancy or other space-occupying adrenal lesion.\r"

DESIGN: Open study of nafcillin and tobramycin or vancomycin and tobramycin administered for 2 weeks with no further therapy. SETTING: County hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 53 intravenous drug abusers with relatively uncomplicated right-sided S. aureus endocarditis, defined by clinical and echocardiographic criteria, and without renal insufficiency, extrapulmonary metastatic infectious complications requiring prolonged therapy or surgery for cure, meningitis, methicillin-resistant organism, aortic or mitral valve involvement, or pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: Nafcillin, 1.5 g intravenously every 4 hours, plus tobramycin, 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 8 hours, administered for 2 weeks. Vancomycin, 30 mg/kg per day intravenously, in two or three divided doses, was used instead of nafcillin for patients allergic to penicillin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven of 50 patients (94%; 95% CI, 87 to 99+) treated with the nafcillin and tobramycin combination were cured. Only 1 of 3 patients treated with vancomycin plus tobramycin (33%, 95% CI, 2 to 86) was cured. CONCLUSIONS: Selected patients with S. aureus endocarditis can be treated safely and effectively with a 2-week course of nafcillin plus tobramycin. Only one of three patients treated with vancomycin plus tobramycin was cured, but three patients are too few to define with confidence the efficacy of this regimen.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether beta-adrenergic blocking agents affect exercise tolerance, exercise conditioning response, and blood pressure response to conditioning in hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with a 10-week exercise period. SETTING: Outpatient, monitored exercise program at a community-based, university-sponsored cardiac rehabilitation facility. PATIENTS: Thirty adults with mean resting blood pressure of 145 mm Hg or greater (systolic), 95 mm Hg or greater (diastolic), or a combined systolic and diastolic pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Mean systolic pressure of 170 mm Hg or more or mean diastolic pressure of 105 mm Hg or more was exclusionary. Mean blood pressure was 145/95 mm Hg; mean age was 46.5 years. INTERVENTION: The beta-1-nonselective blocker was propranolol, 80 mg twice daily. The beta-1-selective blocker was metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, compared with placebo. All patients did exercise conditioning consisting of 40 sessions of aerobic exercise with heart rate monitoring. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting systolic blood pressure measured without drug therapy was lowered markedly after exercise conditioning on placebo (146 to 135 mm Hg) and on metoprolol (144 to 133 mm Hg) (P less than 0.05), but not on propranolol (no change). Acutely, propranolol decreased both maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and exercise duration compared with metoprolol and placebo. Chronically, VO2max increased 24% (95% CI, 8 to 40) in response to training on placebo and 8% on metoprolol (95% CI, 3 to 14); it did not increase on propranolol (95% CI, -10 to 15). CONCLUSIONS: If an exercise program is to be recommended as an adjunct to pharmacologic beta-blockade for hypertension, blood-pressure-lowering effects are preserved and exercise capacity is less affected with a beta-1-selective agent than with a beta-1-nonselective agent. Antihypertensive medications may be avoided altogether for selected patients who sustain an aerobic exercise program.\r"

At 0.1 and at 0.2 mg/kg body weight, 74% and 92% of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors were blocked, respectively; adenosine-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by 84% and 100% at these same doses. Platelet glycoprotein Ib function remained intact, even at 0.6 mg/kg. Acute hemodynamic or hemorrhagic toxicity was not noted.

We demonstrate that the excitation of skin autofluorescence by laser ultraviolet radiation yields characteristic tissue fluorescence spectra that are unrelated to age, pigmentation, or skin thickness. The differences in skin autofluorescence appear to be related to photoexposure. Thus, laser-induced fluorimetry, a noninvasive technique, may be adaptable as a marker of photoaging.\r"

Overall incidence rates and numbers of cases declined from 1973 through 1983, but increased slightly in 1984. The major industrial divisions of agriculture and manufacturing have consistently had the highest rates and numbers of cases, respectively; skin diseases have accounted for almost two thirds of all occupational illnesses within agriculture. In the 1984 Annual Survey, 11 industries were ranked in the \"Top 15\" for both incidence rates and numbers of cases, at the two-digit Standard Industrial Classification level. At the four-digit level for manufacturing, four industries were also ranked in the \"Top 15\" for both indexes. This analysis has identified industries toward which research efforts should be directed to characterize those occupational activities or exposures most responsible for these higher risks.\r"

The granules stained positively with the Fontana-Masson stain for silver-reducing substances and negatively with Perl's stain for iron. Electron microscopy revealed dense inclusion bodies in dermal histiocytes, pericytes, endothelial cells, and Schwann cells, as well as lying free in the extracellular matrix. These \"chlorpromazine bodies\" were quite dense even in unosmicated, unstained ultrathin sections, indicating that the pigmentation is related, at least in part, to the inclusions. Microprobe analysis of the chlorpromazine bodies revealed a striking peak for sulfur, which strongly suggests the presence of the drug or its metabolite within these inclusions.\r"

Over the next two months the skin lesions progressed slowly so erythromycin, to which in vitro testing showed the organism to be sensitive, was added to his therapy. This resulted in a marked improvement of all skin lesions. This case is the first to be reported of disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection in a patient receiving interferon treatment for hairy-cell leukemia.\r"

Current concepts and operative techniques evolved during this period. Fortunately, about half the patients were treated during the latter 4 years, as modern therapy became standardized. The cumulative survival rate was 86% for all patients and 94% for those treated during recent years. Pathologic processes and requirements of operation became clearer by treating 174 patients who had had 198 previous operations by the time of referral. Reoperation was required for complications of operations now considered outdated, heart operations in patients with ascending aortic dilatation, and progressive dilatation of residual segments of the aorta. The 546 patients were followed, and a total of 838 operations were finally employed, resulting in total aortic replacement in 18, near total replacement in 41, entire thoracic aorta in 22, near total thoracic aorta in 33, and the entire thoracoabdominal aorta in 148 patients. Long-term survival in 439 patients after final operation was 66% and 44% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, despite the fact that the median age at first admission was 59. Operative treatment appears to be well-established for this disease.\r"

Twenty-five per cent of the patients who were admitted for gallbladder stones were treated by ESWL, whereas 75% underwent surgery. Mortality of elective treatment for gallbladder stones amounted to 0.25% (0.4% in surgery, 0% in ESWL). Postoperative complication rate was low (4.2% in surgery, 7.0% in ESWL). After ESWL treatment, 80% of the patients were free of stones after a follow-up period of 1 year. Recurrence rate in these patients amounted up to 10%; in seven of 70 patients, mean follow-up period was 6 months after complete disappearance of stones. Twenty-seven per cent of all patients who were admitted for bile duct stones underwent surgery, whereas in the other 73%, calculi were removed via endoscopy. ESWL treatment was used additionally, if necessary. Fragments were left behind in three of 75 patients (4.0%) after surgical treatment, and in 7 of 200 patients (3.5%) after endoscopic and ESWL treatment, respectively. In the latter group, three patients (1.5%) required an additional operation. There were no deaths in either of the groups. The use of ESWL for treatment of gallbladder stones needs to be evaluated in long-term follow-up studies. Thus far, surgery remains the dominating method. Endoscopic procedures, eventually combined with ESWL, represent the preferred treatment for patients with bile duct stones.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of such patients and whether nodal gastrinomas may occur as primary lesions. Eleven patients with nodal involvement but without hepatic metastases are reported (mean follow-up of 129 months). Primary gastrinomas were located in the duodenum in seven (Group 1) and not identified in four (Group 2). In Group 1, five patients remained eugastrinemic after excision of all gross tumors and gastrectomy (n = 4) or pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 1), one patient had residual disease and died of other causes (survival of 88 months), and one patient had MEA-I syndrome with multiple gastrinomas (follow-up of 126 months). In Group 2, three patients became eugastrinemic after nodal excision and total gastrectomy (mean follow-up of 212 months) and may represent primary nodal gastrinomas, and in one patient, liver metastases developed and the patient died. Four deaths occurred in a 27-year period, but only one was tumor-related. There was no significant difference in 20-year survival rates between the two groups (85% vs. 75%). It is concluded that 1) lymph node gastrinomas are usually metastatic from primary duodenal lesions, 2) although rare, nodal gastrinomas may occur as primary lesions, and 3) in the absence of hepatic metastases, lymph node gastrinomas, whether primary or metastatic, have a good prognosis and should not deter aggressive surgical treatment.\r"

The authors report herein their experience with 13 conjoined twins over the last 30 years, involving those of the following forms: thoracopagus (4 cases), omphalopagus (1 case), ischiopagus (4 cases), pygopagus (1 case), craniopagus (1 case), and incomplete or parasitic varieties (2 cases). The various diagnostic and imaging studies used are described in detail for each form of twinning. Separation is best delayed until such infants are relatively mature (i.e., 6-12 months of age). Operative survival was 50% in those operated on in the neonatal period, but 90% in those over 4 months of age. Ten separations were attempted in 13 sets of twins, with 16 operative survivors. Significantly, up to 10 years after surgery, there were six late deaths due to serious associated congenital anomalies, predominantly cardiac. Improved recent survival is probably the result of the availability of more accurate imaging studies and better anesthetic and operative techniques, with great emphasis on performing immediate reconstruction whenever possible. Use of skin expanders and prosthetic mesh has facilitated wound closure. In the future, ex vivo cardiac reconstruction and autotransplantation may permit separation of twins with complicated conjoined hearts.\r"

All patients were graded on a five-point system, with 1 point assessed for an abnormal result in each of the five tests performed. Zero score denoted mild disease; 1-2 points signaled moderate disease; and 3-5 points indicated severe disease. In 68 patients, both an initial and late (mean follow-up period of 14 months) evaluation were performed. Forty-one patients underwent modified Puestow side-to-side Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy. The Puestow procedure alone was performed in 18 patients. Eight patients also had drainage of pseudocysts, seven also had a biliary bypass, and eight had pseudocyst drainage plus bypass, in addition to the Puestow. There were no deaths. Of the 68 patients who were studied twice, 30 had operations and 38 did not. None of the patients with severe disease improved their grade during follow-up. Of 24 patients who did not undergo operation, 17 (71%) who were graded mild/moderate progressed to a severe grade at follow-up. By contrast, only three of the 19 patients operated on (16%) and who were initially graded as mild/moderate progressed to severe disease at follow-up testing. More than 75% of all of the patients had a history of weight loss. Twenty-six of 30 patients operated on (87%) (all of whom had lost weight before surgery) gained a mean 4.2 kg (range 1.4-2.7 kg) after surgery, compared with no significant weight change (range -3.6-2.7 kg) among patients not operated on. These findings support a policy of early operation for chronic pancreatitis, perhaps even in the absence of disabling abdominal pain.\r"

  ".U": "88339426\r", 
  ".W": "In 1985, two policies designed to reduce hospitalization charges for mastectomy patients were instituted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at Houston. The first was a policy of \"same-day\" admissions for elective surgery patients, and the second was early postoperative discharge for mastectomy patients with suction catheter drains in place. The economic savings resulting from these policies was analyzed by comparing demographics, operation, stage of disease, hospital stay, hospital charges, and complications for two groups of patients. Fifty-nine consecutive mastectomy patients treated between 1983 and 1984, before these policy changes, had \"standard management\" consisting of hospital admission 24 hours before surgery and discharge only after the surgical drains were removed. Sixty-one consecutive mastectomy patients treated between 1986 and 1987, after these policy changes went into effect, were admitted from the recovery room after surgery and were discharged with drainage catheters in place, usually within 72 hours. All operations were performed by the same faculty surgeon as a representative experience of the General Surgery faculty. The average hospital stay was reduced from 10.5 to 4.3 days. A mean 39% reduction in hospital charges (from $4867.00 to $2981.00) was achieved by instituting the policies of \"same-day\" admission and early postoperative discharge with drainage catheters in place. Complication rates were not changed. Implementation of this policy resulted in an estimated savings of $750,000.00 in the hospital care of approximately 400 patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at Houston each year. Adjustments in patient care delivery systems from a predominantly inpatient to an outpatient setting required changes in outpatient nursing responsibilities (although not in new personnel). Patient education and written instructions for home care of surgical wounds and drainage catheters were essential for implementing an early discharge policy. With these facts in mind, hospital admission on the day of operation and early postoperative discharge with drainage catheters in place should be the goal for most mastectomy patients.\r"

  ".W": "From August 1982 through March 1988, 531 patients have undergone continent urinary diversion using an ileal reservoir constructed according to the method of Kock. For the past year, the Division of Urology at the USC School of Medicine in Los Angeles has used the principle of Kock reservoir construction for primary lower urinary tract reconstruction after cystectomy in 39 highly selected male patients by means of a ureteroileal urethrostomy. Early complications occurred in 86 of 531 patients (16.2%), resulting in an operative mortality rate of 1.9% (ten of 531). The early complication rate was 16.5% in patients undergoing single stage cystectomy and Kock pouch construction and 15.2% among patients undergoing Kock pouch conversion. Late complications have been analyzed in a group of 489 patients who have undergone Kock cutaneous diversion. The complications unique to continent urinary diversion, their incidence, and the effect of technical modifications in reducing the number of late complications are discussed. Since the time of the last modification, in July 1985, the overall incidence of late complication has dropped to 22%. Based on this ongoing experience, the authors conclude that: 1) the continent ileal reservoir as conceived by Kock remains the best internal reservoir for bladder replacement in terms of volume, accommodation with the lowest internal pressures compared with other alternative reservoir construction, 2) the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve mechanism is a reproducible, highly effective mechanism that prevents reflux in 95% of patients and produces excellent continence, 3) our enthusiasm remains tempered by the need for reoperation in approximately 10-15% of patients, usually due to a pinhole fistula or false passage at the base of the efferent nipple valve mechanism, 4) electrolyte abnormalities rarely occur and gastrointestinal dysfunction is unusual in the absence of radiation, and 5) continent urinary diversion is a viable long-term concept that provides a real alternative in terms of quality of life and self-image for the patient undergoing urinary diversion.\r"

These symptoms can be disabling and are frequently unresponsive to drug therapy. Fifteen patients with documented PGS, including 13 women and two men, were recently treated by completion gastrectomy (CG) over a 5-year period. Gastric emptying study (GES) was markedly prolonged in 12 of the patients studied, and improved partially in only one patient (8%) with the administration of metoclopramide alone or combined with other gastrokinetic drugs. Patients were evaluated both before and after surgery, using a modified Visick rating system and a severity of symptoms (SS) score based on seven gastrointestinal (G.I.) and five systemic variables. All 15 patients underwent CG and reconstruction with a 50 cm Roux-en-Y limb. There were no operative deaths or complications related to the esophagojejunal anastomosis. Mean postoperative follow-up was 13.9 months, with a range of 2-65 months. After CG, the Visick rating and overall SS score improved significantly. The improvement in SS score was primarily due to a significant decrease in G.I. symptoms with little or no change in systemic symptoms. Overall, 86% of patients reported a satisfactory clinical result. CG, while seemingly radical, can be performed with low risk, and for properly selected patients with PGS, may be the treatment of choice.\r"

Resuscitative thoracotomy was required in 20 patients (6.6%), and only two survived. The most commonly injured organs were the small bowel (60%), colon (41.6%), liver (29.3%), vascular structures (24.6%), stomach (17.3%), and kidney (17.0%). The overall survival rate for the series was 88.3%; however, if only the 226 patients without vascular injuries are considered, the survival rate was 97.3%. In the 35 patients who died, the blood pressure on admission was 51 mmHg, 18 required a resuscitative thoracotomy, four visceral or vascular injuries were present, and the median blood replacement was 18 units. The cause of death was perioperative shock in 30 patients (85.7%), whereas five patients (14.3%) died of sepsis and multiple organ failure. The most common postoperative complication in survivors and patients who died later in the study was an intra-abdominal abscess (3.0%). Rapid conservative operative techniques for civilian gunshot wounds leads to few postoperative complications and an excellent survival rate, especially if vascular injuries are not present.\r"

  ".U": "88339432\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 250 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were operated on at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 1965 and 1981. The operation performed was curative resection in 154 patients, palliative resection in 16 patients, diverting colostomy in 21 patients, exploratory laparotomy in 11 patients, and transanal removal in 48 patients. Of the 154 curative resections, 115 were abdomino-perineal (APR), three were total proctocolectomies, and 36 were low anterior resections (LAR). No anastomotic complications were observed in this latter group. Operative mortality was 3%. Complete follow-up was obtained in 152 patients (98.7%). Five- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 68.8 and 59.4%, respectively, for patients with Dukes' B1 adenocarcinoma (n = 32), 55.8 and 44.2% for Dukes' B2 tumors (n = 52), and 42.9% and 25.4% for Dukes' C tumors (n = 63). Distant metastases developed in 59 patients (39.6%), and pelvic recurrence developed in another 18 patients (12%); 5-year survival rates were 23.6% and 22.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression showed that stage (p = 0.0001), race (p = 0.03), tumor morphology (p = 0.02), and vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion (p = 0.001) were statistically significant in their association with survival. Logistic regression analysis confirmed these results and allowed for the estimation of 5-year survival probabilities in 16 groups of patients defined by various associations of these four factors. These estimates ranged from a high of 92% in Caucasian patients with Stage B, exophytic tumors with no vascular or lymphatic microinvasion, to a low of 14% in black patients with Stage C, nonexophytic tumors and with the presence of vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion. Univariate analysis showed that histologic type (p = 0.0006), stage (p = 0.05) and vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion (p less than 0.001) were significantly associated with the incidence of pelvic recurrence. Analysis of the extent of the operation revealed that the incidence of pelvic recurrence was reduced by the performance of a wide pelvic lymphadenectomy (9.4% vs. 16.4%), but the result did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.16). In conclusion, this study confirms the well-established prognostic value of the Dukes' staging classification of rectal carcinoma. Further, the analysis reveals that race, tumor morphology, and the presence or absence of lymphatic and/or vascular microinvasion significantly influence outcome. By associating these four statistically significant and independent variables, the prognosis for any individual patient can be estimated more precisely than by using Dukes' staging alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The morbid risk of Alzheimer's-type dementia was studied in 421 first-degree relatives of 43 patients who met current consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease and 47 healthy controls. Relatives of patients showed an approximate 50% (90- to 95-year) lifetime risk of dementia, regardless of the platelet membrane phenotype of the respective proband, which was over four times the control value. However, relatives of patients with increased platelet membrane fluidity who developed dementia exhibited symptoms significantly earlier than relatives of patients with normal platelet membrane fluidity. Alternative genetic models that describe the relationship of platelet membrane fluidity and Alzheimer's disease are discussed.\r"

Depressed patients had a 29% higher mean total 24-hour activity level, with no change in circadian amplitude or frequency. Daily peak activity (acrophase) averaged 2.05 hours later in depressed patients, with no overlap between the groups. The degree of phase delay correlated significantly with the 4 PM postdexamethasone serum cortisol level. These tentative findings suggest that elderly unipolar depressed patients have prominent chronobiological disturbances in the modulation of activity levels and possibly other physiological processes. These differ strikingly from reported disturbances in younger or bipolar depressed patients.\r"

Antisomatostatin IgG was isolated by affinity chromatography. The recognition site for somatostatin was retained by F(ab)'2 fragments.

The oxygen sensor was calibrated at 37C in room air. This temperature was also used for measurements. Compression pressure in the IPC garment was standardized to 50mmHg inflation and zero mmHg deflation. Cycle time was set to 30 seconds inflation and 30 seconds deflation. It was found that using this combination of pressure and cycle times, tcPO2 fell during compression in all subjects and returned to the precompression level after the treatment. Although reactive hyperemia of various intensities occurred in some subjects after compression, tcPO2 did not rise significantly above the resting level. This suggests that the symptomatic improvement reported by patients treated with IPC was more likely to be due to enhanced removal of metabolites and supply of nutrients than to an improvement in leg oxygenation.\r"

Pressures of 540mmHg and 700mmHg were applied for six hours on both sides of the scapula and backs of five anesthetized animals. Two hours after release of indentation, serum CPK levels showed marked elevation and remained elevated even after one week. The elevated levels of CPK were shown to correspond to defined pathology of the tissue as determined histologically. On the other hand, inorganic phosphate began to decrease after release of indentation and recovered to the preindentation level after one day. Lactate dehydrogenase did not change significantly throughout the experiment. These results offer important evidence of the potential of CPK as a systemic indicator of muscle damage at an early stage of pressure sore formation.\r"

The median and ulnar nerves were stimulated at the wrist and at the axilla 25cm distal to the sternal notch. The compound muscle action potentials were recorded from thenar and hypothenar muscles. Averaged tracings from 32 consecutive stimuli at the wrist were obtained. The averaged F-wave latencies were measured to the peak (Fwp) of the averaged F-wave. The M-wave latencies from wrist and axilla stimulation were measured to the onset of the wave (Mw and Ma, respectively). The averaged AFLL (a-AFLL) was calculated as (Fwp + Mw)-2 Ma. The average values of a-AFLL were 14.12 +/- 0.88msec for median nerve, and 13.97 +/- 0.90msec for ulnar nerve. There was no significant difference between male and female subjects, nor between the right and left sides. Seven subjects with EMG evidence of C8 or C8 to T1 radiculopathy, although manifesting normal AFLL gauged by the regular method (ie, measured to the onset of the shortest F-wave latency among eight tracings), had significantly longer \"averaged AFLL\" in both median and ulnar nerves of the affected side than the a-AFLL obtained from the normal side. It is concluded that the a-AFLL is a more sensitive measure than the \"regular AFLL\" in the assessment of proximal nerve lesion (especially C8 or C8 to T1 radiculopathy).\r"

A 63-year-old man noted that since birth his right arm had been considerably larger than his left. Fifteen years before our initial examination, however, he first noted weakness of his right wrist and finger extensors without sensory loss. Physical examination revealed atrophy and weakness of the musculature innervated by the PIN distal to the supinator and the first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Sensation was intact throughout the entire right arm. Electromyographic examination demonstrated membrane instability and decreased activation of voluntary motor units in the radial nerve musculature distal to the supinator and in the FDI. Electrophysiologic evidence suggested an anomalous innervation of the FDI by the PIN. Surgical exploration revealed hypertrophy of the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, and supinator muscles, with atrophy of all muscles distal to the supinator. The supinator muscle appeared to be constricting the PIN and was sectioned. Clinical and electrodiagnostic follow-up at six months and again at four years revealed no further deterioration.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue deposits of basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are associated with various clinical manifestations of inflammation. We addressed the possibility that native proteins modify the ability of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals to stimulate human inflammatory cells. Neutrophil superoxide release and chemiluminescence in response to HA crystals (0.3-4.0 mg/ml) were blunted by serum and plasma. Inhibitory activity was progressively removed from serum by sequential adsorption with HA crystals, suggesting that the inhibitors were crystal-bound proteins. Thus, we characterized HA crystal-bound plasma proteins by O'Farrell gels: Fibronectin, transferrin, albumin, alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG), alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, Gc globulin, haptoglobin, and high density lipoprotein apolipoproteins were major bound species. Of these, AHSG was the most active inhibitor of HA-induced neutrophil superoxide release, and this glycoprotein partially (60%) restored inhibitory activity to HA-adsorbed serum. AHSG also bound in vitro to the related BCP crystal, octacalcium phosphate, but only minimally to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals and monosodium urate crystals. Suppressive effects on neutrophil stimulation exhibited by AHSG were also specific for BCP crystals. AHSG was present in noninflammatory synovial fluids bound to synthetic HA crystals in vitro, and AHSG could be detected on native synovial fluid HA crystals. We conclude that the binding of AHSG may modulate the inflammatory potential of BCP crystals.\r"

The possibility that low production or nonproduction of IgM-RF in vitro may be explained by treatment with second-line agents alone, irrespective of disease activity, was analyzed in 133 RA patients whose disease status was assessed by multiple laboratory and clinical measures. The results indicate that treatment with second-line agents and in vitro IgM-RF synthesis are independently associated with disease activity.\r"

Twelve of the 22 patients had recurrent tumors; ten had a localized fibrotic mass, and two were found to have coexistent local fibrotic masses and distant recurrence. In 11 of the 12 patients with recurrence, MR imaging demonstrated the recurrent tumor as an area of increased signal intensity on long repetition time, long echo time spin-echo pulse sequences. Signal intensity of localized fibrosis varied with the time since initial treatment. Separate signal intensity measurements for T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained in regions of interest in recurrent tumors, early fibrosis (1-6 months after first treatment), and late fibrosis (more than 12 months). Ratios of signal intensity of muscle to that of fat were calculated, and a statistical analysis (Student t test) was performed. On heavily T2-weighted pulse sequences, the differences in signal intensity between late fibrosis and recurrent tumors were statistically significant (P less than .001). MR imaging is useful in identifying recurrent pelvic neoplasm and distinguishing it from posttreatment fibrosis.\r"

Three types of surfaces, namely, 1) intact, 2) mechanically de-endothelized, and 3) postlaser, have been simultaneously exposed to platelet-enriched plasma in a sequentially organized artificial circulation system. Then the adherent platelets have been counted on the treated surfaces, and the relative thrombogenicity index has been calculated according to the equation T = (A1 - Aint)/(Ad - Aint), where Aint, Ad, A1 = the adherent platelet counts on intact, mechanically de-endothelized, and laser-treated surfaces, respectively. The following lasers have been evaluated: 1) Nd-YAG, 1,060 nm, continuous wave, 4W; 2) argon-ion, 480 and 514 nm and argon-ion, 350 nm, continuous-wave, 1 W and 400 mW [corrected], respectively; 3) excimer XeCl, 308 nm, pulsed, 30 mJ per pulse, repetition rate 10 Hz [corrected]; and also 4) the laser-heated metal probe (2 mm diameter, Trimedyne, Nd-YAG) 1,060 nm, 8 W. The thrombogenicity index values obtained were 83 +/- 7, 72 +/- 8, 57 +/- 9, 63 +/- 7, and 82 +/- 9%, respectively. The differences between these values were statistically insignificant. The data are suggestive of the essential requirement of, at least, anticoagulant therapy after laser angioplasty irrespective of the laser type.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective multicenter study, 368 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients aged 15 to 65 years were treated with an intensified induction and reinduction regimen; 272 (73.9%) achieved complete remission (CR). The median remission duration (MRD) is 24.3 months, and the probability of being in continuous CR (CCR) at greater than 5 years is .37. The median survival for all 368 patients is 27.5 months, and the probability of being alive at 5 years is .39. For the 272 patients in remission the median survival is 58.4 months, and the probability of being alive at 5 years is .49. A lower CR rate was seen for patients with bleeding at diagnosis or with splenomegaly/hepatosplenomegaly. The prognostic factors unfavorable for remission duration were time to CR greater than 4 weeks v less than 4 weeks (P = .0002), age greater than 35 years v less than 35 years (P = .0008), leukocyte count greater than 30,000/microL v less than 30,000/microL (P = .0112), and null ALL v common ALL (c-ALL)/T cell ALL (T-ALL) (P = .05). The remission duration correlated strongly (P = .0001) with the number of these independent prognostic factors. In patients with none of these adverse factors the MRD has not yet been reached, with one adverse factor the MRD is 21.9 months, and with two or three adverse factors the MRD is only 9.6 months. For the immunologic subtype T-ALL, the probability of being in CCR at greater than 5 years is .55; for c-ALL, .34; and for null ALL, .24. According to these results, patients were stratified into a low-risk group with a CCR rate of .62 and a high-risk group with a CCR rate of .28, with the latter now allocated to either further chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation in first remission.\r"

In vitro 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) doses were established on granulocyte macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU) in culture of bone marrow by using the GM-CFU assay for the following drugs: 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), Adriamycin, L-asparaginase, bleomycin, hydrocortisone, VP-16, spirogermanium, Taxol, and vincristine. The leukemic cell kill efficiency of these drugs at IC90 doses was compared with that of 4-HC on acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cell lines by using the limiting-dilution assay. Under these conditions, no single drug was superior to 4-HC. To increase the in vitro effect in leukemic cell kill, combinations of vincristine with hydrocortisone, Adriamycin, VP-16, and 4-HC were investigated. Vincristine at 1 to 5 micrograms/mL increased the marrow cytotoxicity of hydrocortisone, Adriamycin, and VP-16, but it was protective (subadditive) with 4-HC. Vincristine and 4-HC in combination was additive to supraadditive on ALL cell lines, increased the leukemic cell kill by one to two logs above 4-HC alone at IC90 doses (P less than .05), and was not affected by the addition of excess marrow cells. The recommended doses for chemopurging in clinical studies are vincristine, 1 to 5 micrograms/mL, plus 4-HC, 5 micrograms/mL.\r"

The growth inhibition accompanied monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells and a loss of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity in Molt-4 leukemic cells. The growth inhibition also paralleled a decrease in c-myc protein and RI cAMP receptor protein. Thus, cAMP analogs selective for either site 1 or site 2 of the protein kinase appear to restore a coupling of proliferation and maturation in leukemic cells.\r"

It is now recognized that not every case of leukemia with a high proportion of progranulocytes can be classified as FAB-M3. We reviewed the light and ultrastructural morphology of the original diagnostic material from this case, and we report that the leukemia from which HL-60 was derived does not conform to the currently recognized entity of FAB-M3 and is more appropriately classified as an acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation, FAB-M2.\r"

Highly elevated TGF-beta mRNA levels were observed in all five ATL cell samples tested; however, in three acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples, in one acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), and one chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), TGF-beta expression was relatively lower. In normal peripheral mononuclear cells TGF-beta mRNA was weakly detectable. Colony stimulating activity for NRK found in the conditioned medium from ATL cells as well as other leukemia cells correlated well with the levels of TGF-beta mRNA expression. In all three ATL samples tested, stimulation of 3H-thymidine uptake by purified TGF-beta from platelets was apparent. These results suggest that ATL cells are secreting active TGF-beta in a relatively high amount, as compared with other leukemia cells, and may proliferate in response to the factor via an autocrine manner. Furthermore, considering that TGF-beta stimulates bone resorption, we can speculate that the relatively high amount of TGF-beta in ATL cells contributes to the hypercalcemia frequently seen in ATL patients.\r"

The resected rectum contained five macroscopic carcinoid tumors, 36 microcarcinoids, and innumerous extraglandular endocrine cell proliferations. Endocrine cell microproliferations, in their early stage consisting of one to 15 micronests, were mainly located within the bundles of muscularis mucosae, having no contact with mucosal glandular structures. All of the immunohistochemically examined proliferations of extraglandular endocrine cells contained S-100 protein-positive dendritic cells, and some endocrine cells coexisted with submucosal ganglion cells. In contrast, there was no increase in intraglandular endocrine cells. The origin of rectal carcinoid tumor may be the extraglandular endocrine cells, a distinct compartment of mucosal endocrine cells of the rectum.\r"

  ".W": "From December 1976 to July 1986, 34 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were treated with daunorubicin (DNR) alone and simultaneous supportive therapy with low-dose heparin, platelet transfusions, and fresh frozen plasma. Two consecutive maintenance therapy regimens were employed in patients who achieved complete remission (CR): (1) a classical maintenance with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, with DNR plus methyl-GAG re-inductions; (2) from 1982 an intensive sequential combination therapy regimen was administered. CR was achieved in 23 patients (68%). Only one patient had leukemic resistance. Other failures were a consequence of post-chemotherapy complications. A multivariate logistic regression analysis has been performed to evaluate the prognostic importance on response to remission induction of 25 patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis. The significant variables in decreasing order of significance were: serum albumin level, fever at diagnosis, serum creatinine level, and age. The median duration of remission and survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis were projected to be 24 and 25 months, respectively. Relapses occurred in 11 of 23 CR patients. Nine patients remained in the first remission from 5+ to 37+ months. Short-term (CR) and long-term results (duration of remission and survival) in APL treated for induction with DNR alone were similar to those obtained in other subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukemia by intensive combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "88079875\r", 
  ".W": "Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) is common to most epithelial ovarian tumors. Therefore, it is potentially a good marker of this disease. This hypothesis was evaluated by measuring the serum levels of CA 125 in 81 patients with ovarian cancer (25 with nonactive and 56 with active disease), in 105 patients of both sexes with nonovarian tumors, and in 171 healthy controls of both sexes. The serum levels of three other markers, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and human chorionic gonadotropin, beta subunit (beta-hCG), were also measured in the same 357 subjects. The results of this study clearly indicate the clinical irrelevance of both CEA and beta-hCG as tumor markers in ovarian carcinomas. Conversely, the clinical usefulness of CA 125 and TPA was confirmed. In particular, CA 125 and TPA showed comparable sensitivity, while CA 125 showed a higher specificity for ovarian cancer than TPA. The association of CA 125 with TPA was very useful in continuous observation of patients with active disease in order to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the therapy. Moreover, for patients in clinical remission, the markers allowed early detection of a recurrence of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to rationalize the use of therapy in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in elderly patients, 69 cases of primary AML in patients older than 60 years of age were reviewed retrospectively. Therapy was empirical and 12 patients received supportive care (SC) only, 35 received aggressive chemotherapy (AC), and 22 received low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-araC). Patients receiving SC only often had a poor Karnofski index and their median survival was 17 days. Aggressive chemotherapy yielded complete remissions (CR) in 48% of the patients, whereas 23% of the patients had resistant disease (RD) and 29% had other failures (OF). Low-dose araC, which was administered to patients significantly older than those receiving AC, yielded 23% CR, 68% RD, and 9% OF, with important hematologic toxicity in most patients. Median survival was 211 days in patients receiving AC and 235 days in patients treated with LD-araC. Survival beyond 2 years from diagnosis was noted in the AC group only. A low Karnofski index was the strongest factor in poor prognosis, while age was not a prognostic factor. The initial characteristics of the patients did not allow us to define groups of patients who should be treated by either AC or LD-araC. We concluded that the decision to treat patients actively should rely more on the patient's general condition and socio-economical criteria than on age.\r"

Immunohistochemical examinations were made on pancreatic specimens from 45 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. In normal pancreatic duct, the antigens were restricted to the luminal surface. In some hyperplastic epithelium, however, they were localized not only to the basolateral plasma membranes but also to the cytoplasm. In neoplastic glands, the antigens were distributed over the entire surface of the cells and in the surrounding stroma adjacent to the basal membranes of the malignant cells. The findings were compatible with previous observations of CEA and secretory component (SC) localization in gastric and colonic mucosa. In addition, the staining intensity of CA 19-9 in the routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections was much superior to that of CEA. The relationship between CA 19-9 and other blood group antigens, such as Lewis a and Lewis b, also was discussed. Localizations of these antigens in pancreatic tissues are useful for the biologic analysis of abnormalities of the pancreatic duct epithelium, and may well facilitate pathologic diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

Every variable except CA 19-9, serotonin, and DNA showed significant prognostic information in univariate analysis. However, in the multivariate analysis stage was the predictive factor with the highest hazard ratio, but absence of central node involvement, tumors with diameters between 3.5 cm and 6 cm, exophytic tumor growth, well-differentiated tumors, tumors with CEA immunoreactivity, absence for staining with serotonin, and diploid tumors also were included in the relative risk model. Thus, the aforementioned variables appear to play a role in the establishment of a prognostic index.\r"

We studied 50 patients: 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, nine with lymphomas, four with pleural effusion and previously known neoplastic diseases, ten with nonlymphomatous mediastinal masses, and two with compression of the superior vena cava. In 33 of 50 patients, computed tomography (CT) showed mediastinal masses, and in one, an aneurysm of the thoracic descending aorta. All patients had previously had chest x-ray and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2-DE) examinations in order to recognize the presence of masses. Two-DE was found to have similar specificity (94.1 percent) but higher sensitivity (90.9 percent vs 60.6 percent) if related to radiographic examination. The positive predictive value was 96.7 vs 95.2 percent and the negative predictive value was 84.2 percent vs 55.1 percent. In particular, 2-DE was more useful than chest x-ray examination when a concomitant pleural or pericardial effusion was present. Moreover, abnormalities of cardiac function due to compression or infiltration and the follow-up of patients were better evaluated.\r"

  ".U": "88082434\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies using isolated rat hepatocytes have indicated that the bioactive form of thyroid hormone, T3, is metabolized in liver predominantly by conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulfate. In contrast to T3 itself and the stable glucuronide, T3 sulfate is rapidly degraded by successive deiodination of the tyrosyl and phenolic rings. In the present study we have investigated the biliary excretion of T3 metabolites in male Wistar rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. The animals were injected iv with 1) saline, 2) the deiodinase inhibitor propylthiouracil (PTU; 1 mg/100 g BW), 3) the phenol sulfotransferase inhibitor dichloronitrophenol (2.6 mumol/100 g BW), or 4) a combination of both drugs. After 15 min, 10 muCi [125I]T3 were administered iv, and bile was collected for 30-min periods until 4 h after tracer injection. Secretory products were analyzed by HPLC. In control animals, 22.4% of the dose was excreted in bile mainly in the form of T3 glucuronide. In PTU-treated rats biliary excretion was increased to 36.0% of the dose (P less than .001) due to a dramatic increase in the sulfates of T3 and 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Dichloronitrophenol by itself had no effect on the biliary clearance of T3, but greatly inhibited PTU-induced excretion of sulfates. These results strongly suggest that sulfation and subsequent deiodination is an important pathway of T3 metabolism in vivo.\r"

Using an animal model of intestinal anaphylaxis, we have correlated alterations in water and electrolyte transport, associated with intraluminal challenge, with specific intestinal mucosal mast cell degranulation by following systemic as well as local release of rat mast cell protease II. This protease is specific for intestinal mucosal mast cells and is known to selectively attack type IV collagen, which is found in basement membranes. Intraluminal antigen challenge in sensitized animals dramatically increased serum and intraluminal levels of rat mast cell protease II. Serum levels continued to rise throughout the duration of antigen challenge. Although light microscopy of challenged intestine demonstrated little distortion of mucosal architecture, ultrastructural examination revealed significant disruption to the basement membrane and underlying collagenous matrix of the intestinal mucosa. Our findings indicate that during mucosal immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions, rat mast cell protease II is released and is associated with ultrastructural changes in the intestinal mucosa. The systemic appearance of this specific protease provides a serum marker of intestinal anaphylaxis.\r"

The patient developed diarrhea within the first few days of life, with mean stool output of 250 ml/kg.day (expected 10 ml/kg.day). Small bowel biopsy showed mild focal enteritis. Serum levels of known gastrointestinal secretagogues were normal. No tumor was detected. Diarrhea was not adequately controlled by various drug treatments. Addition of subcutaneous SMS 201-995 produced a significant sustained decrease in stool output to 80-100 ml/kg.day. During SMS 201-995 treatment, no metabolic, hormonal, or growth abnormalities were noted. SMS 201-995 was discontinued after 9 mo because of patient irritability. Stool output rose immediately to 173 ml/kg.day, and remained stable for 6 mo. It is concluded that SMS 201-995 was a safe and effective treatment in this single childhood case of severe idiopathic secretory diarrhea.\r"

All six patients had significantly reduced bone density compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to degrade 45Ca-labeled bone in vitro was studied. The mean percent 45Ca release in four hyper-IgE patients (40.8 +/- 8.6) was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than in ten age-matched healthy control subjects (7.1 +/- 2.6), seven age-matched patients with recurrent infections (7.9 +/- 1.6), or nine patients with severe atopic dermatitis and elevated serum IgE levels (5.8 +/- 1.3). Monocytes from four of four patients studied spontaneously released abnormally high levels of prostaglandin E2. Bone degradation by these monocytes was significantly reduced in the presence of 10(-6) M indomethacin in vitro. Administration of aspirin in vivo to two hyper-IgE patients reduced boned degradation by their monocytes to normal levels. These results suggest that monocytes from patients with hyper-IgE syndrome are activated to resorb bone via products of the prostaglandin synthase (cyclooxygenase) pathway. The activation of cells in the monocyte/macrophage family to resorb bone may contribute to the osteopenia observed in hyper-IgE syndrome.\r"

The phenotypic analysis of surface antigens with a panel of lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that six of 20 cases expressed phenotypes of lymphoid blastic transformation with pre-B cell markers. One of these cases was shown to coexpress cluster designation 2 of T cell marker on the same cells by two-color immunofluorescence analysis. Eight cases, including two cases that also had a megakaryocytic component, showed phenotypes expressing differentiation antigens of myeloid series. Three expressed a phenotype of megakaryoblastic transformation. The remaining three cases had no surface marker characteristic of any cellular lineage. The genotypic analysis by Southern blot hybridization showed that immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were rearranged in all of six lymphoid blastic transformations and that rearrangement of a T cell receptor beta chain gene was present in only one lymphoid blastic transformation that had no T cell surface marker. DNA samples in all cases of nonlymphoid blastic transformation were retained in the germ line configuration for both immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adolescents with either T cell or non-T cell ALL entered remission significantly less often than did children (P = less than .02 and P = less than .001, respectively). Within each of the major immunophenotypes of ALL, adolescents had shorter duration of continuous complete remission: early pre-B (non-B, non pre-B, non-T) (P = .001), pre-B (P = .05), and T (P = .027). We compared the clinical characteristics of adolescents and children, and lymphoblast characteristics present at diagnosis to account for the inferior prognosis of adolescent patients. Adolescents had a higher incidence of T cell ALL (P = .0001) and thus a higher incidence of all T cell-associated characteristics. Adolescents with non-T, non-B ALL were more likely to be male (P = .044), and to have higher leukocyte counts (P = .002) and lower levels of IgG (P = .0003), IgA (P = .0001), and IgM (P = .002). Their leukemic cells had lower PAS scores (P = .0001), a higher incidence rate of L2 morphology by French-American-British (FAB) criteria (P = .001), common ALL antigen negativity (P = .0001), and hypodiploid or pseudodiploid karyotypes (P = .004). These findings clearly indicate an increased incidence of prognostically unfavorable clinical and biologic features in adolescents with ALL, providing a biologic explanation for their poor prognosis.\r"

A prognostically favorable cytogenetic feature, hyperdiploidy greater than 50 chromosomes, was found in 33% of cases classified as common ALL antigen positive (CALLA+) early pre-B (common) ALL, in contrast to 18% of pre-B cases (P = .012), 5% of T cell cases (P less than .001), and none of the B cell cases (P less than .001) or cases of CALLA negative (CALLA-) early pre-B ALL (P = .002). The frequency of translocations, an adverse cytogenetic feature, was significantly lower in CALLA+ early pre-B ALL cases (35%) than in B cell (100%; P less than .0001), pre-B (59%; P less than .001), or CALLA- early pre-B (62%; P = .016) cases. Thus, patterns of chromosomal change differ widely among the major immunophenotypic groups of ALL and may account for reported differences in responsiveness to treatment.\r"

Only the constitutional chromosome (trisomy 21) was found in TMD, whereas new cytogenetic abnormalities emerged in ANLL. A mixed growth pattern in stem cell cultures during TMD suggested the existence of an abnormal clone that might be responsible for the evolution into ANLL at a later date. Serial cytogenetic studies and culture studies of peripheral blood cells may help to understand the pathophysiology and risk of ANLL in patients with TMD.\r"

  ".W": "Mice exhibit a marked suppression of motility when they are placed in the same cage in which they had previously received an electric shock. This suppression of motility is believed to be stress-induced and is a conditioned response. A decrease in the Met-enkephalin levels and a decrease in the dopamine (DA) turnover in the striatum of these \"conditioned suppression\" groups have been exhibited. The present study investigates whether inhibition of enkephalin degradation induced by an enkephalinase A and/or an aminopeptidase inhibitor attenuates a conditioned suppression of motility. The effects of thiorphan and bestatin, both alone and in combination, were investigated. Thiorphan alone (25, 50 and 100 micrograms i.c.v.) significantly attenuated the conditioned suppression of motility in a dose-dependent manner, but not bestatin (25, 50 and 100 micrograms i.c.v.) alone. The combination of these drugs (25 and 50 micrograms, each, i.c.v.) also significantly reduced the conditioned suppression of motility in a dose-dependent manner. The attenuation of conditioned suppression of motility induced by thiorphan and bestatin was antagonized by naloxone (5 mg/kg s.c.) and pimozide (100 micrograms/kg i.p.). In addition, the combination of thiorphan and bestatin reversed the decreases of Met-enkephalin levels and the decreases of DA turnover in the striatum in conditioned suppression group. These results suggest that attenuation of the conditioned suppression of motility induced by thiorphan and bestatin may be directly proportional to the increases of endogenous opioid peptide contents, and that the effect of these drugs may be related to the striatal DAergic system.\r"

The gastric acid output was enhanced by electrical stimulation of the left cervical vagus nerve after cutting the bilateral cervical vagus nerves. Intracerebroventricular administered PGE2 (0.05-0.5 microgram/animal) dose-dependently inhibited the vagally stimulated acid output whereas the same doses of PGE2 administered i.v. were without effect. The inhibitory effect of PGE2 (0.1 microgram/animal, i.c.v.) was more potent than the effects of the same doses of PGD2 and PGF2 alpha (PGE2 greater than PGD2 greater than PGF2 alpha). PGE2 (0.1 microgram/animal)-induced inhibition of the gastric acid output was abolished by splanchnicectomy, cutting the preganglionic splanchnic nerves under diaphragm, or by combined pretreatment with adrenalectomy and 6-hydroxydopamine (50 mg/kg i.v., 3 days before). This PGE2-induced inhibition was also abolished by pretreatment with phentolamine (5 mg/kg i.m.), but not by propranolol (5 mg/kg i.m.). These observations suggest that the i.c.v.-administered PGs, in particular PGE2, induces a central excitation of the sympathoadrenomedullary outflow and that the resultant activation of gastric alpha adrenoceptors inhibits the vagally stimulated gastric acid output.\r"

  ".W": "The binding characteristics of [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) in mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells were studied. The specific binding of [3H]PDBu to intact cells was saturable and to a homogeneous class of binding sites, with a Kd of 21 nM. Phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate and PDBu competed for [3H]PDBu binding whereas 4 alpha-phorbol did not. The binding of [3H]PDBu to the cells was selective, as it was not affected by several agents that interact with various neurotransmitter receptors in N1E-115 cells. The density of the phorbol ester binding site decreased as the cell passage increased, although the Kd of [3H]PDBu binding remained relatively constant. Upon exposure of the cells to 100 nM PDBu for 1 hr at 37 degrees C, a translocation of the binding sites from the cytosol to the particulate fraction was observed. A similar pretreatment of the cells with 1 mM carbamylcholine, however, was ineffective. The specific binding of [3H]PDBu was down-regulated in both a time- and a concentration-dependent fashion by exposure of the cells to PDBu. When the cells were treated with 100 nM PDBu for 24 hr, the maximum binding site density of [3H]PDBu was decreased to 47% of control, with no change in the Kd. Recovery of [3H]PDBu binding after exposure to the phorbol ester for 24 hr was slow and incomplete, and was dependent on protein synthesis. The down-regulation of [3H]PDBu binding after pretreatment of the cells with PDBu for 24 hr was accompanied by an attenuation of the ability of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate to inhibit carbamylcholine-induced cyclic GMP formation as well as inositol phosphates accumulation in these cells, indicating desensitization of protein kinase C function.\r"

Thermotolerance was induced in M14 cells by sublethal heat treatment at 41 degrees C for 1 hr. However, induction of thermotolerance was blocked by indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. Exogenous PGE2 at concentrations up to 10 micrograms/ml also protected cells from heat damage. These data suggest that prostaglandin synthesis increases during heat stress and may play a role in protecting cells from thermal damage.\r"

Death from renal failure in three patients known to us prompted a study of renal function in this disorder. Of the 38 patients with Type I glycogen storage disease under our care, the 18 children under 10 years old had normal renal function. Fourteen of the 20 older patients (13 to 47 years) had disturbed renal function, manifested by persistent proteinuria; many also had hypertension, hematuria, or altered creatinine clearance. Progressive renal insufficiency developed in 6 of these 14 patients, leading to three deaths from renal failure. At the onset of proteinuria, creatinine clearance was increased in seven patients (3.05 +/- 0.68 ml per second per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; range, 2.47 to 4.13 [normal range, 1.33 to 2.33 ml per second per 1.73 m2]). Renal biopsies were performed in three patients after an average of 10 years of proteinuria. All three biopsies demonstrated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in various stages of progression. Our data suggest that chronic renal disease is a frequent and potentially serious complication of Type I glycogen storage disease. In addition to treating hypoglycemia vigorously, physicians should monitor renal function carefully in patients with this disorder.\r"

To determine whether plasma cholesterol levels in patients with NIDDM could be reduced by drug therapy, we assessed the effect of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled manner in 16 white patients with NIDDM and mild to moderate elevations of plasma cholesterol. Lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) or a placebo was given for four weeks, during which blood glucose concentrations remained controlled. As compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 26 percent, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 28 percent, and LDL apolipoprotein B by 26 percent. Lovastatin therapy also reduced plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 31 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Although there was no change in the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol fell by 29 percent. No side effects or abnormalities in serum values were noted during short-term lovastatin therapy. The beneficial effects of lovastatin on plasma lipid levels in patients with NIDDM could decrease the risk of the development of coronary heart disease.\r"

Subjects completed questionnaires on behavior; type, duration, and location of their dental practice; infection-control practices; and estimated numbers of potential occupational exposures to HIV. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to HIV and to hepatitis B surface antigen (unvaccinated subjects). Fifty-one percent of the subjects practiced in locations where many cases of AIDS have been reported. Seventy-two percent treated patients who had AIDS or were at increased risk for it. Ninety-four percent reported accidental puncturing of the skin with instruments used in treating patients. Adherence to recommended infection-control practices was infrequent. Twenty-one percent of unvaccinated subjects had antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Only one dentist without a history of behavioral risk factors for AIDS had serum antibodies to HIV. We conclude that despite infrequent compliance with recommended infection-control precautions, frequent occupational exposure to persons at increased risk for HIV infection, and frequent accidental puncturing of the skin with sharp instruments, dental professionals are at low occupational risk for HIV infection.\r"

To develop diagnostic tests for such a predisposition, we identified restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) within the retinoblastoma gene and tested their usefulness in predicting the risk of cancer in 20 families with members who had hereditary retinoblastoma. We were able to make predictions in 19 of the 20 kindreds. In 18 kindreds, we demonstrated a consistent association of marker RFLPs with the mutation predisposing to retinoblastoma. In the 19th kindred, there may be a lack of cosegregation of the DNA polymorphisms within the gene and the site of the mutation predisposing to retinoblastoma. However, there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis of the retinal lesion in a key member of this kindred; if the lesion is not a retinoblastoma, there is no discrepancy between the DNA polymorphisms and the retinoblastoma trait. We conclude that it is feasible and clinically useful to use these DNA polymorphisms to determine the risk of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested a critical role of specific gene loss in several embryonic tumours and certain adult cancers. In retinoblastoma, hemizygosity or homozygosity of a recessive mutant allele results in the loss of normal gene product, and this seems to cause the manifestation of the disorder. Familial polyposis coli (FPC) is a human autosomal dominant trait characterized by numerous adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum, and a high incidence of colon carcinoma. Karyotype analyses have failed to detect specific deletion or translocation. We report the use of polymorphic DNA markers to look for the somatic loss of heterozygosity at specific loci. Investigation of 38 tumours from 25 FPC patients, and 20 sporadic colon carcinomas from 19 patients, revealed frequent occurrence of allele loss on chromosome 22, with some additional losses on chromosomes 5, 6, 12q and 15. The FPC gene-linked DNA probe C11p11 also detected frequent allele loss in both familial and sporadic colon carcinomas but not in benign adenomas. These results suggest the possible involvement of more than one chromosomal locus in the development of familial and sporadic colon carcinomas.\r"

This is reminiscent of the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes or putative oncogenes in numerous human tumours and leukaemias as a result of chromosomal translocations or DNA rearrangements. Here we report the characterization of a new putative oncogene isolated from a murine erythroleukaemia induced by the acute leukaemogenic retrovirus spleen focus forming virus (SFFV). An important and unusual feature of this genomic locus Spi-1 (for SFFV proviral integration) is that rearrangements due to SFFV integration were found in 95% of the erythroid tumours studied. A 4.0-kilobase messenger RNA was detected in rearranged tumours. No Spi-1 rearrangement was detected in other virally induced myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid tumours tested.\r"

The validity of this simulation is supported by (1) the biochemical effects of simultaneous muscle contraction and DNP are not additive, suggesting that exercise and DNP stress the same pathways; (2) the effects of increasing concentrations of DNP and increasing levels of stimulation are similar with an early drop in phosphocreatine, increasing lactate and inosine monophosphate (IMP), and a late fall in ATP levels; and (3) DNP provocation in a patient with McArdle's disease demonstrated an absence of lactate and high levels of IMP correlating with clinical findings. DNP provocation may be a simple way of studying metabolic pathways in neuromuscular diseases.\r"

To better define the role of HIV in the pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction, HIV isolation and antibody studies were investigated from the CSF in 52 seropositive patients, 29 with and 23 without neurologic signs and symptoms, in various stages of disease development ranging from asymptomatic to ARC to AIDS. HIV was recovered from the CSF of 5 of 29 (17%) patients with neurologic signs and symptoms and 5 of 23 (22%) neurologically asymptomatic patients. All patients with positive CSF HIV cultures had antibodies directed against HIV p24 and gp41 in serum and CSF by Western blot analysis and elevated intra-blood-brain-barrier total IgG and HIV-specific IgG synthesis rates. The frequency of CSF HIV isolation from the group of seropositive patients without AIDS, 9 of 32 (28%), exceeded that of patients with AIDS, 1 of 20 (5%) (p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that HIV infects the CNS early in the course of viral infection and prior to the development of HIV-associated neurologic abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Serum samples obtained from 133 patients with gynecologic malignancies were assayed for two tumor-associated antigen markers: CA125, an ovarian marker, and lipid-associated sialic acid, a nonspecific marker. In the patient population, there were 77 papillary serous and 19 unspecified ovarian adenocarcinomas, and 24 miscellaneous ovarian carcinomas. Thirteen patients had nonovarian malignancies. Sixty-nine percent (74 of 108) of the patients with known disease had abnormal CA125 levels, whereas only 32% (20 of 63) had abnormal lipid-associated sialic acid levels. Changes in CA125 serum levels reflected the disease status of the patients for whom there were serial serum samples. Normal levels of CA125 corresponded to no evidence of disease in 100% (six of six) surgically evaluated patients and 75% (30 of 40) of clinically evaluated patients. Changes in CA125 levels from normal to abnormal corresponded to disease progression in 80% (12 of 15) of the patients. Decreases in CA125 levels from abnormal to normal corresponded to complete clinical response in 55% (11 of 20), and partial clinical response in 45% (nine of 20). No such correlations were available for lipid-associated sialic acid antigen levels. For tumors that express CA125 antigen, serum levels appear to be a good marker for the extent of malignant gynecologic disease. Levels of CA125 that rose from normal to abnormal were usually associated with recurrent disease.\r"

The test uses 12 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) markers that bracket the cystic fibrosis gene on chromosome 7, and chorionic villus tissue as a source of DNA from the fetus at risk for cystic fibrosis. The fetus was predicted by DNA analysis to be unaffected (although a carrier of one cystic fibrosis gene); this diagnosis was confirmed postnatally by the standard sweat electrolyte test. The genetic linkage test is informative in more than 99% of families with cystic fibrosis-affected members and is also useful for determination of carrier status. The test is both more informative and more accurate than one based upon the markers Met and D7S8 (J3.11) alone. The analysis can be done directly from chorionic villus tissue, and therefore can provide a diagnosis as early as nine to 12 weeks after conception.\r"

The children had been evaluated with standardized tests of intelligence at the time of diagnosis and periodically thereafter. Declines in IQ and cognitive dysfunctions have been previously described. School placements, educational histories, attendance records, learning strengths and weaknesses, social/emotional adjustments, and grade level achievements in reading and mathematics as measured by standardized achievement tests are reported here. Children achieved less than the expected levels in both reading and mathematics given both pretreatment and most recent IQ scores. Neither sex nor initial IQ were related to achievement scores. Children experienced difficulty with attention/concentration, memory, sequencing, and comprehension when performing school tasks. Individual children showed different degrees of dysfunction, but results of this study suggest that there are patterns of specific learning disabilities rather than global retardation. A small number of children achieved greater than expected levels, indicating that individualized instruction, tutoring, and parental support may reduce some learning deficits. Early educational intervention is recommended for similarly treated patients.\r"

Indicator cell lines were constructed that contain the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Infection of these cells by HIV activates the expression of CAT protein. Isolates of HIV-1 with divergent nucleotide sequences activated the indicator cell lines to a similar extent, approximately 500- to 1000-fold. Human T cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2, equine infectious anemia virus, and herpes simplex virus 1 did not activate the indicator cell lines. Isolates of simian immunodeficiency virus and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 4 activated these cells to a much lesser extent, which suggests that these viruses contain similar, but distinct, trans-activators. This assay can be used for the detection, quantitation, and typing of HIV and for studying the effect of drugs on the replication of HIV in different cellular backgrounds.\r"

Staining was performed by the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunocytochemical technic on bone marrow smears from 29 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, on 17 normal peripheral blood and/or bone marrow smears, on bone marrows from 10 cases of lymphoid leukemia, and on lymph nodes of 13 patients with lymphoma. Neoplastic cells from 11 of 11 patients with either M4 or M5 leukemia had positive results, whereas only 2 out of 18 cases of M1, M2, M3, M6, and M7 leukemia had positive results. In normal samples, only peripheral blood monocytes, bone marrow macrophages, and megakaryocytes stained. Lymphoid neoplasms were unreactive. These results suggest that monoclonal antibody Y1/82A may be a useful reagent in detecting cases of M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukemia and that it offers a valuable alternative to nonspecific esterase cytochemistry.\r"

D4S62 maps, by Southern blot analysis using somatic-cell hybrids, to 4p16.1 closer to the centromere than does D4S10. The use of the polymorphisms detected by D4S62 increases the informativeness of markers close to the gene for Huntington disease and will be useful for preclinical diagnosis. D4S62 detects transcripts of approximately 6,000 nucleotides in rat, mouse, and monkey liver and brain. This represents the first demonstration of conserved expressed sequences close to the gene for Huntington disease.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the practical utility of these methods as applied to the problem of paternity testing. Bayesian methods are used to compute the posterior probability distribution of the genetic relationship parameters. Use of an interval-estimation approach rather than a hypothesis-testing one avoids the problem of the specification of an appropriate null hypothesis in calculating the probability of paternity. Monte Carlo methods are used to evaluate the utility of two sets of genetic markers in obtaining suitably precise estimates of genetic relationship as well as the effect of the prior distribution chosen. Results indicate that with currently available markers a \"true\" father may be reliably distinguished from any other genetic relationship to the child and that with a reasonable number of markers one can often discriminate between an unrelated individual and one with a second-degree relationship to the child.\r"

In the families of white individuals, the results of both the sib-pair and lod-score linkage analyses strongly indicate that a gene regulating DBH activity is linked to the ABO blood group locus on chromosome 9q (i.e., lod score 5.88 at a recombination fraction of .0). However, the transformation used has a large effect on the maximum lod score and estimated recombination fraction. This putative gene does not appear to be polymorphic in the family of blacks.\r"

In a group of black Americans living in Philadelphia, the frequency of GALKA was found to be very close to values expected from independent estimation of white admixture. The authors have suggested that the ancestors of these blacks might have been virtually all GALKP homozygous. We have looked for carriers of GALKP genotypes among 73 black Africans; only 33 probands were shown to have a low RBC GALK. To detect white admixture, immunoglobulin allotypes Km and Gm were investigated in 50 individuals of the sample; 15 GALKP carriers with low RBC GALK and 30 of 35 individuals with normal RBC GALK shared Gm phenotypes exclusive to blacks. Our work demonstrates for the first time the polymorphism of GALK in black Africans in the absence of white admixture.\r"

The clinical manifestations in these four pedigrees were similar to those found in the kindred with a late onset. In 15 persons, the process was asymptomatic. In the 26 symptomatic patients, the arthropathy was mild, with clinical and radiologic features similar to those observed in sporadic chondrocalcinosis. There was no linkage of chondrocalcinosis to the HLA-A and HLA-B antigens in the 11 pedigrees in which tissue typing was performed. The pattern of involvement in these 13 pedigrees supports an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. These data suggest that hereditary chondrocalcinosis is not infrequent and very often is clinically indistinguishable from the sporadic form of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic relapsing disease of apocrine gland-bearing areas, most frequently occurs in the axillae, groin, perineal, and perianal regions. Hidradenitis of vulva is frequently misdiagnosed and inadequately treated. The case of a 15-year-old nulliparous black female adolescent referred for evaluation of multiple draining fistulas of the anogenital region is presented. Diagnostic studies for granulomatous disease were negative. Results of a barium enema were normal and biopsies were compatible with the diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. She was treated for 22 weeks with isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg daily, with an excellent response. Side effects were minor and included cheilitis, mild xerosis, and a transient elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Few patients with severe hidradenitis have been responsive to this synthetic vitamin A derivative. A review of the literature indicates that the results of treatment with isotretinoin for hidradenitis have been at best equivocal. Isotretinoin should never be used during pregnancy because of known teratogenic effects. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment.\r"

During normal pregnancy, the beta hCG to hCG ratio appears constant at approximately 0.5% after 5 weeks of gestation. In contrast, gestational choriocarcinoma was characterized by absolute serum beta hCG levels varying from three to 280 times greater than the maximum values observed during pregnancy and by exceedingly high beta hCG to hCG ratios. In complete hydatidiform mole, this ratio was intermediate between normal pregnancy and choriocarcinoma. The ratios of free beta hCG to hCG will distinguish normal from complete molar pregnancy (p less than 10(-8)), hydatidiform mole from choriocarcinoma (p less than 10(-4)), and choriocarcinoma from normal pregnancy (p less than 10(-8)) with high probability. Finally, it was found by means of the high sensitivity hCG immunoradiometric assays (less than 0.02 ng/ml) that this assay predicted very early tumor recurrence in patients with gestational choriocarcinoma.\r"

We therefore studied the effect of human MBP on ion transport in dog tracheal epithelium. We mounted the posterior tracheal membranes of mongrel dogs in Ussing chambers and measured potential differences across the membranes and short-circuit current. Using 22Na+ and 36Cl- as tracers, we determined net ion movements. The addition of MBP (5 X 10(-6) M) to the mucosal, but not to the serosal, side of the membranes produced an increase in short-circuit current from 2.25 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SE) to 2.78 +/- 0.23 muEq.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.0001) and in net chloride secretion from 1.57 +/- 0.22 to 2.31 +/- 0.24 muEq.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.01). There was no change in net sodium movement. Pretreatment with indomethacin (10(-5) M) attenuated, but did not abolish, the increase in short-circuit current. After exposure to MBP, prostaglandin E2 release into the serosal bathing solution increased from 10.0 +/- 4.2 to 17.0 +/- 6.9 ng.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.05). The results of this study indicate that MBP simulates prostaglandin E2 production and chloride secretion by dog tracheal epithelium. Thus, eosinophils in the airways, through release of MBP, may affect mucociliary clearance by changing the volume and composition of respiratory tract fluid.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of aminophylline on air-flow-induced constriction in the canine lung periphery. A wedged bronchoscope technique was used to measure airway wall temperature (Taw) and collateral resistance (Rcs) before and after air flow was increased from a baseline flow of 200 to 500, 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 ml/min for 2-min periods. When a sublobar segment was challenged with dry air, Taw fell during the challenge (p less than 0.05) and Rcs increased 5 min postchallenge (p less than 0.01). Pretreatment with aminophylline (20 mg/kg) reduced the fall in Taw by 31% and reduced the increase in Rcs by 53%. Aminophylline did not significantly affect either the concentrations of PGD2, TxB2, and histamine or the cell numbers and profiles obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage performed 5 min postchallenge. However, trends were consistent with the decreased physiologic responses observed. Finally, aminophylline proved ineffective in reducing the constrictor response of peripheral lung challenged directly with aerosolized histamine or PGD2. Because preaminophylline and postaminophylline peripheral lung sensitivity (as assessed by the ratio delta Rcs/delta Taw) were not significantly different, we conclude that aminophylline attenuates physiologic responses by reducing the strength of the stimulus. Aminophylline could do this by facilitating the replacement of heat and water removed during dry air challenge by increasing bronchial or pulmonary blood flow, or by reducing heat and water loss via changes in mucosal permeability.\r"

One patient had both cholecystitis and a pneumonia of uncertain origin and three patients had drug reactions. Although overall the source of fever was usually readily apparent, focal hepatic and/or splenic mycosis produced protracted fevers that were difficult to diagnose.

In all types of lesion, osteoclastlike multinucleate giant cells were negative for both types of antigen, but a proportion of mononuclear cells gave positive reactions. While the possibility that these cells are reactive cannot be excluded, in giant cell tumor and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, their frequency and their morphologic similarity to the rest of the tissue suggest that they may be an intrinsic part of the neoplasm.

The best outcomes followed surgery during the first two months of life, prompt lens fitting, aggressive occlusion therapy, and regular follow-up. Nonetheless, aphakic eyes did not achieve a visual acuity of 20/20 in the sample. Prospective \"preferential-looking\" data demonstrated a failure of aphakic eyes to keep pace with the normal developmental course after 18 months of age. Poor visual outcomes following late surgery appear to be due primarily to the development of amblyopia during the first months of life, which may aggravate compliance problems and further deteriorate prospects of visual rehabilitation.\r"

  ".U": "88108141\r", 
  ".W": "Blood coagulation is initiated when plasma factor VII(a) binds to its essential cofactor tissue factor (TF) and proteolytically activates factors X and IX. Progressive inhibition of TF activity occurs upon its addition to plasma. This process is reversible and requires the presence of VII(a), catalytically active Xa, Ca2+, and another component that appears to be associated with the lipoproteins in plasma, a lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI). A protein, LACI(HG2), possessing the same inhibitory properties as LACI, has recently been isolated from the conditioned media of cultured human liver cells (HepG2). Rabbit antisera raised against a synthetic peptide based on the N-terminal sequence of LACI(HG2) and purified IgG from a rabbit immunized with intact LACI(HG2) inhibit the LACI activity in human serum. In a reaction mixture containing VIIa, Xa, Ca2+, and purified LACI(HG2), the apparent half-life (t1/2) for TF activity was 20 seconds. The presence of heparin accelerated the initial rate of inhibition threefold. Antithrombin III alpha alone had no effect, but antithrombin III alpha with heparin abrogated the TF inhibition. LACI(HG2) also inhibited Xa with an apparent t1/2 of 50 seconds. Heparin enhanced the rate of Xa inhibition 2.5-fold, whereas phospholipids and Ca2+ slowed the reaction 2.5-fold. Xa inhibition was demonstrable with both chromogenic substrate (S-2222) and bioassays, but no complex between Xa and LACI(HG2) could be visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Nondenaturing PAGE, however, showed that LACI(HG2) bound to Xa but not to X or Xa inactivated by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Thus, LACI(HG2) appears to bind to Xa at or near its active site. Bovine factor Xa lacking its gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain, BXa(-GD), through treatment with alpha-chymotrypsin, was used to further investigate the Xa requirement for VIIa/TF inhibition by LACI(HG2). LACI(HG2) bound to BXa(-GD) and inhibited its catalytic activity against a small molecular substrate (Spectrozyme Xa), though at a rate approximately sevenfold slower than native BXa. Preincubation of LACI(HG2) with saturating concentrations of BXa(-GD) markedly retarded the subsequent inhibition of BXa. The VII(a)/TF complex was not inhibited by LACI(HG2) in the presence of BXa(-GD), and further, preincubation of LACI(HG2) with BXa(-GD) slowed the inhibition of VIIa/TF after the addition of native Xa. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of VII(a)/TF involves the formation of a VIIa-TF-XA-LACI complex that requires the GD of XA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A retrospective survey was performed to assess the incidence of all types of malignancy in 39 patients treated with chlorambucil (mean daily dose 4.25 mg, mean duration of treatment 25 months). These patients were compared with 30 patients with RA who received contemporaneously, the purine analogues azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (mean dose 100 mg, mean duration of treatment 24 months). Eight patients treated with chlorambucil and one patient receiving purine analogues developed cutaneous malignancy (p = 0.03). In the chlorambucil-treated patients these were mostly multiple and recurrent. Three patients treated with chlorambucil developed myeloid leukaemia or a preleukaemic state, whilst no patient treated with purine analogues developed this complication. The use of chlorambucil in RA is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous as well as haematological oncogenesis.\r"

Frequencies of DPw alleles in CML and ANLL patients were not significantly different from 254 controls, except that in ANNL DPw1 was absent. This was most likely due to the concurrent absence of DR3 with which DPw1 is in linkage. In contrast, in ALL, frequencies of DPw2 and DPw5 were significantly increased (corrected P less than 0.05, relative risk (RR) = 2.19 and corrected P less than 0.01, RR = 6.92, respectively). This was not due to linkage with DR. The frequency of DPw1 also tended to be reduced, but this was not caused by a similar decrease of DR3 in ALL. These results, therefore, demonstrate both positive and negative associations between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products which are in only very weak linkage with the rest of HLA, and acute lymphocytic, but neither acute nor chronic myelogenous, leukemias. The HLA-DP region could thus contain long sought-after genes influencing susceptibility and resistance to leukemogenesis.\r"

This activity was demonstrated as ectopic new bone formation on implantation of freeze-dried fractions of 12 of 30 tumors into athymic nude mice. Pulmonary metastases developed in ten (83%) of the 12 patients with osteosarcomas that produced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and bone metastases developed in six (50%) of the patients. The mean period from diagnosis to metastasis was 4.2 months in these patients. In contrast, pulmonary metastases developed in only eight (44%) of the patients with osteosarcomas that did not produce BMP, and bone metastases developed in only two (11%) of these patients. The mean period to metastasis was 12.3 months in these patients. The incidence of metastases in the patients with osteosarcomas producing BMP was significantly higher, and the mean period to metastasis was also significantly shorter than in the other group. The five year survival rates of patients with osteosarcomas that did and did not produce BMP were 33.3% and 54.6%, respectively (P = 0.015, log-rank test). Thus the bone morphogenetic activity of primary osteosarcoma tissue seems to be closely correlated with the prognosis of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one children with leukemia or lymphoma treated with multi-drug chemotherapy for more than 2 years were reviewed to identify and characterize the occurrence of febrile episodes related to vincristine (VCR) injection. In nine of the 31 children, more than two febrile episodes apparently attributable to VCR during maintenance therapy were identified. No such episodes were found to have occurred during induction therapy. The median age at diagnosis of these nine children was 3.2 +/- 1.6 years, significantly lower than the 6.8 +/- 4 years of the other 22 children (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was observed between these two groups in laboratory data obtained before the VCR injections, and the drugs used in combination with VCR were apparently unrelated to the incidence of febrile episodes. All of these febrile episodes began within 24 hours after VCR injection. Peak levels of 38 degrees C to 39 degrees C occurred 6 to 24 hours after onset. The episodes also were accompanied by mild, general fatigue and a loss of appetite. They ranged in duration from half of a day to 4 days, but those persisting more than 3 days occurred in three of the five children whose regimens did not include corticosteroid. The results thus suggest that fever is an immediate reaction to the toxicity of VCR in young children, and that the duration of fever can be shortened by combining VCR with corticosteroid.\r"

In the clinical setting, when HCC is suspected (a situation in which tumors are usually larger than 2 cm and the pretest probability of disease is between 20% and 60%) the DTS and SS is an excellent test for the diagnosis or exclusion of HCC.

The SGPT activity at diagnosis was significantly associated with the duration of event-free survival (P less than 0.0001). For the 13 patients with SGPT activity greater than 40 IU/l the 5-year event-free survival was only 9%.

The relative risk of relapse or death for children with SGPT activities of less than 8 IU/l, 8-40 IU/l, and greater than 40 IU/l were 0.2 (95% confidence limits 0.09-0.45), 1, and 4.8 (2.2-10.7), respectively (P less than 0.001). The SGPT activity at diagnosis was not associated with clinically assessed liver enlargement.

In most pancreas cancer tissue the 2-3 sialylated Lea antigen was found to be specifically distributed in cancer cells as determined by immunohistologic techniques, while a significantly smaller amount of the antigen was detected in surrounding nonmalignant pancreas tissue, which was infiltrated by cancer cells. Conversely, the 2-6 sialylated Lea antigen was abundantly present in nonmalignant pancreas tissue, while it was less frequently present in pancreas cancer cells. When the sera of 66 patients with pancreas diseases were examined for these sialylated Lea antigens, correlation studies showed that the levels of 2-3 sialylated Lea tended to be 44.1 times more than the levels of 2-6 sialylated Lea in the sera of cancer patients. The average ratio of 2-3 sialylated Lea to 2-6 sialylated Lea was 0.23 in the sera of patients with pancreatitis. These data collectively indicate that the 2-3 sialylation of Lea is remarkably enhanced, and the 2-6 sialylation of Lea antigen is suppressed in pancreas cancer. The determination of the 2-3 sialylated Lea to 2-6 sialylated Lea ratio in patients with pancreas diseases may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of pancreas cancer and nonmalignant pancreatic disorders.\r"

Ten survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) and either 1800 or 2400 cGy of cranial radiation were studied with MRI and neuropsychologic testing. Magnetic resonance (MR) scans were normal in nine of ten patients. One patient had prominent and asymmetrical lateral ventricles and mildly enlarged cortical sulci.

Each dog was fed 1 can of ALPO and electromechanical activities of the stomach were recorded for the next 120 min. The results show that intraarterial boluses of met-enkephalin (75 micrograms/kg), PGE2 (36 micrograms/kg), and epinephrine (36 micrograms/kg) induced episodes of antral dysrhythmias whereas saline (1 cc) did not. The postcibal antral motility index for the test period was not altered following saline injection, but it was reduced by 61%, 70%, and 81% following the administration of met-enkephalin, epinephrine, and PGE2, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs. baseline period). During periods of normal electrical rhythm, PGE2 and epinephrine significantly reduced the antral motility index (2.07 +/- 0.93 and 3.24 +/- 0.79, respectively) vs. saline (7.92 +/- 0.44) (p less than 0.05 for both drugs) whereas met-enkephalin (4.98 +/- 0.56) did not. In contrast, during episodes of dysrhythmia, met-enkephalin significantly depressed antral motility (1.70 +/- 0.74) (p less than 0.05 vs. periods with normal electrical rhythm) whereas neither epinephrine nor PGE2 caused a further reduction in antral motility from what was seen during periods of normal electrical rhythm (1.84 +/- 0.72 and 1.34 +/- 0.37, respectively). We thus conclude that intraarterial administration of met-enkephalin, PGE2, or epinephrine induce gastric dysrhythmias postcibally and depress antral contractile activity. The relaxatory effect of met-enkephalin on antral contractions is primarily due to its dysrhythmic effect whereas PGE2 and epinephrine inhibit antral motility even when the electrical rhythm is undisturbed.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously proposed that stimulated release of Ca from bone requires Na-Ca exchange. 3',4'-Dichlorobenzamil (DCB), an amiloride analog, has been shown to directly block Na-Ca exchange in cardiac tissue. To further test our hypothesis we have characterized the effect of DCB on basal and stimulated bone resorption from neonatal mouse calvaria in vitro. DCB inhibition of resorption from bones stimulated with 1 nM PTH was dose dependent. The IC50 was about 7 microM, and complete inhibition occurred at 10 microM. DCB alone inhibited basal Ca release at 10 microM. Amiloride, which is less potent as an inhibitor of Na-Ca exchange, had no effect on PTH-stimulated resorption at concentrations lower than 0.1 mM, but inhibited basal resorption at 10 microM. Stimulated Ca release was inhibited either by continuous treatment with DCB plus PTH for 72 h or by a short pretreatment with DCB alone, followed by removal of DCB before addition of PTH. At least 9-h pretreatment with DCB was necessary to block the subsequent response to PTH. The inhibitory effect of DCB pretreatment could be prevented if PTH was present together with DCB during pretreatment periods of 24 h or less. This reversibility suggests that the inhibition by DCB is not simply a toxic effect of the drug. DCB also inhibited resorption stimulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or prostaglandin E2, which indicates that the effect of DCB is beyond the level of specific hormone-receptor interaction. Thus, the data are consistent with a role for Na-Ca exchange in the process of hormonally stimulated bone resorption.\r"

To elucidate the effects of this drug on both systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, it was administered in two conscious rat models of portal hypertension. The dose-response curves showed that the somatostatin analogue significantly decreased portal pressure at a lower dose in rats with cirrhosis than in portal vein-stenosed rats. Calculated ED50 values were significantly different among all groups. Intravenous infusion of 8 micrograms/kg body wt.h of somatostatin analogue significantly decreased cardiac output by approximately 20% in both groups of portal hypertensive rats and increased mean arterial pressure by 7%. Accordingly, systemic vascular resistance markedly increased, indicating vasoconstrictor effects of this drug. The somatostatin analogue also significantly decreased portal tributary blood flow by 18% in portal vein-stenosed rats and 27% in cirrhotic rats. In sham-operated rats, somatostatin analogue had no effect on the systemic or splanchnic circulation. This study shows that somatostatin analogue decreases portal pressure principally by reducing portal tributary blood flow. This reduction may be due to either a direct vasoconstrictive effect or diminution in vasoactive hormone release.\r"

The enzyme cleaved G-17 at four peptide bonds: Trp4Leu5, Ala11Tyr12, Gly13Trp14, and Asp16Phe17. The cleavage at Gly-Trp was rapid and 1-13 G-17 was an important intermediate. All the products of cleavage of synthetic 1-13 G-17 were also found after degradation of intact G-17. When normal human volunteers received infusions of G-17, there appeared in their blood peptides with the properties of 1-11, 1-13, 1-16, and 5-17 G-17 on the basis of immunochemical and high-performance liquid chromatographic properties. These observations provide evidence that endopeptidase 24.11 is involved in gastrin metabolism in humans, and may be responsible for the generation of G-17 fragments in the peripheral circulation.\r"

Quantitatively, PGEM was the most important product, followed by PGF2 alpha, and then PGFM. The rates of production of the three metabolites in the presence of saturating concentrations of PGE2 and NADPH were, respectively, 1, 0.5, and 0.15 pmol/mg protein.min. The pattern of metabolism was similar in myometrium from pregnant and nonpregnant women and was not affected by the presence or absence of labor. These data demonstrate that PG-9-oxo-reductase is present in human myometrium. They also suggest that the activity of this enzyme may influence the levels of PGEM and PGFM in the peripheral circulation, particularly during parturition when there is increased intrauterine PG release.\r"

  ".W": "In women with recurring vaginitis, treatment of a vaginal Candida infection is not always accompanied by an alleviation of symptoms, and infection frequently reappears after termination of the chemotherapeutic agent. To determine whether an allergic reaction might be involved in symptom prolongation and susceptibility to reinfection, sera and vaginal washes from patients were examined for specific IgE antibodies. With RAST modified to ELISA, anti-Candida albicans IgE was identified in 18.8% of saline vaginal washes, but in only 6.1% of sera, obtained from 64 patients. Similarly, 25% of 16 patients were positive for vaginal fluid IgE, but only 6.3% had serum IgE to their partners' seminal fluid. The detection of specific IgE antibodies vaginally but not in the peripheral circulation suggested the occurrence of a localized vaginal hypersensitivity response. Vaginal fluid-derived IgE antibodies reactive with contraceptive spermicides or present in the particulate fraction of saline vaginal washes were also identified. Vaginal fluids with IgE antibodies also contained detectable levels of prostaglandin E2. A vaginal allergic response can predispose to recurrent Candida infection by inducing prostaglandin E2 synthesis that suppresses cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

The murine macrophage cell line PU5 (H-2d haplotype) does not express class II antigen constitutively and only trace levels are detected after induction with IFN-gamma. In an attempt to understand the nature of the defect in PU5, stable macrophage hybrids were derived by fusing a thymidine kinase-negative variant of PU5 with thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages from CBA/J mice (H-2k haplotype). Hybrid clones isolated after HAT selection had approximately 35% more DNA than the PU5 parent suggesting that chromosomal loss had occurred post-fusion. While none of the hybrids expressed class II antigens of the k haplotype, constitutive expression of class II antigens of the d haplotype was detected by both micro-ELISA and by flow cytometry. Incubation of these hybrids with IFN-gamma resulted in a further increase in class II expression. Co-ordinate reactivation of both I-A and I-E antigens was observed in the PU5-macrophage hybrids. In contrast, although the IFN-gamma receptor on PU5 and the macrophage hybrids was indistinguishable by Scatchard analysis, neither intracellular class II antigen nor transcription of class II mRNA was detected in IFN-gamma-treated PU5. Reactivation was dependent on the PU5 fusion partner and was not related to a general post-fusion event as hybrids formed between PU5 and the murine fibroblast line A9 did not express class II antigen constitutively or after IFN-gamma induction.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed molecular analysis of three wild-derived MHC haplotypes provided evidence for an important role of the E beta recombinational hot spot in the recent evolution of the mouse I region. Examination of RFLP and restriction maps of cloned DNA permitted the mapping of the natural cross-over events in the haplotypes carried by strains B10.GAA37 (w21) and B10.KPB128 (w19) to a fragment of DNA not exceeding 4.1 kb, which lies almost entirely within the intron separating the beta 1 and beta 2 exons of the E beta gene. In the w14 haplotype (strain B10.STC77), which appears to be a natural recombinant between a p-like parental haplotype and another wild-derived haplotype, the site of crossing over can be mapped to a segment between the beta 2 exon of the E beta gene (left border) and the E beta 2 gene (right border). This segment containing the cross-over site in the w14 haplotype includes the E beta hot spot. In addition, the w14 haplotype as well as the standard p haplotype contain a deletion of approximately 1.0 kb in the second intron of the E beta gene, which may represent the product of an unequal cross-over event in a E beta recombinational hot spot.\r"

  ".W": "Urocanic acid (UCA, deaminated histidine) is a major ultraviolet-absorbing component of the stratum corneum. On UV irradiation, the naturally occurring trans form converts to the cis isomer. We have previously postulated that UV-induced systemic suppression is initiated by cis-UCA by way of an antigen-presenting cell defect. To test this hypothesis further, we have investigated the antigen-presenting cell (APC) function of splenic dendritic cells (DC). Splenic DC were prepared from mice 7 days after 1 h UV irradiation (27 kJ/m2) or i.v. administration of 50-200 micrograms/mouse of cis- or trans-UCA. Dendritic cells from UV-irradiated or cis-UCA-treated mice had a significantly impaired (APC) ability, assessed by the proliferative response of purified T cells from mice immune to DNP6 OVA to DC pulsed with this antigen. Dendritic cells from mice given trans-UCA had normal APC ability. The number of FcR+ cells was the same in DCs from all four treatment groups, and the number of IAd+ cells and the intensity of IAd expression were not decreased in DCs from UV-irradiated or cis-UCA-treated mice. Mixture of DCs from UV- or cis-UCA-treated mice with DCs from normal mice did not suppress APC activity. Dendritic cells taken 3 days after UV or cis-UCA treatment, in contrast to DC taken 7 days after treatment, had normal APC ability, indicating a time delay in the generation of the APC defect. In contrast, addition of cis-UCA or trans-UCA (66 micrograms/ml) directly to an in vitro proliferation assay had no effect, suggesting that cis-UCA may be activated in vivo. These results support our original hypothesis that cis-UCA has a natural role as a modulator of immune function.\r"

  ".W": "Both mitoxantrone and etoposide have been shown to be active in monotherapy trials of relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This phase II study was undertaken to assess the antitumor activity and toxicity of the combination in refractory and poor-risk AML. The regimen consisted of mitoxantrone, 10 mg/m2/d intravenously (IV), and etoposide, 100 mg/m2/d as short infusion, both on days 1 to 5. Sixty-one patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. Twenty-one were primarily refractory to conventional courses of cytarabine, daunorubicin, and thioguanine; 20 patients had poor-risk first relapse (relapse within 6 months of first complete remission [CR] or relapse under continuous maintenance therapy); 11 had second or subsequent relapses; and nine developed secondary AML after myelodysplastic phase or myelofibrosis. Twenty-six patients (42.6%) attained a CR and seven (11.5%) a partial remission (PR). The median duration of continuous CR was 4.7 months, with a range of 21 days to 14 months, excluding four patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation. Severe myelosuppression was observed in all patients, with a median time to CR of 49 days. Nonhematologic toxicity included stomatitis (mainly grade 1 and 2) in 41 patients, nausea (mainly grade 1 and 2) in 44, infections (mainly grade 3) in 33, and fever of unidentified origin in 11. Other than transient, mild cardiac failure in nine patients, in some of them combined with grade 1 to 2 tachyarrhythmia, no other drug-related cardiac events were observed. Two cases of early death within the first 6 weeks of treatment were registered. Thus, the combination of mitoxantrone and etoposide is a highly active and well-tolerated regimen for refractory and poor-risk AML.\r"

An intended six cycles of Adriamycin (ADR) (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cytarabine (ara-C), and thioguanine (TG) were administered with as short an intercycle time as possible. No further therapy was administered. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 118 of 187 patients (63%). On univariate and multivariate analyses achievement of CR correlated adversely with a low serum albumin at presentation and an antecedent marrow disorder. Forty-five patients continue in first remission between 15 months and 8 1/2 years, no relapses being seen after 3 1/2 years (median follow-up, 3 1/2 years). The median duration of remission was 1 year. M3 morphology, a blast count less than 100 x 10(9)/L, and absence of hepatosplenomegaly correlated favorably with remission duration. There was no difference in duration of remission between patients receiving 3, 4, 5, or 6 cycles. The best results overall were achieved in patients under the age of 40, with 43% projected to remain free of disease at 5 years. Fifty patients remain alive between 17 months and 9 years, the predicted actuarial survival being 25% at 5 years.\r"

In the present study, 40 children in continuous complete remission from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were given a battery of tests to assess memory functioning 5 years after CNS prophylaxis. All children were free of CNS disease at diagnosis and had been randomly assigned to receive CNS prophylaxis with either 1,800 cGy cranial irradiation (CRT) plus intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) or IT MTX plus intravenous (IV) high-dose MTX (HDMTX). No treatment- or age-related differences were seen on 16 standardized memory measures. However, scores of the combined sample were significantly lower than age-corrected norms on a test of visual-spatial memory and on four scales of verbal memory. Differences in methods or intensity of CNS prophylaxis and study group selection criteria are proposed to explain our findings and to resolve discrepancies with previous reports. The long-term neuropsychological sequelae in these survivors of ALL may be attributable to some common factor, such as the disease itself or systemic and IT chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Following observation of the predictive value of the histologic extent of tumor cell destruction after preoperative chemotherapy for metastasis-free survival (MFS) in osteosarcoma, a randomized study was undertaken with the aim of (1) sparing some patients the unpleasant side effects of highly toxic drugs like doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (CPDD) by administering these drugs postoperatively only after poor response with a milder preoperative regimen, and (2) improving the prognosis of patients responding poorly to the initial treatment by use of a salvage chemotherapy postoperatively. The available patients were divided into two groups. Those in the study arm received a preoperative chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) and the triple drug combination of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin (BCD) and were switched to DOX/CPDD postoperatively in case of poor response. DOX/CPDD was used besides HDMTX for initial treatment in the control arm, and BCD alternatively with CPDD/ifosfamide (IFO) for postoperative salvage treatment. The response rate of the study arm was significantly inferior to the control arm (26% v 60%; P less than .001). The actuarial 4-year MFS rate of poor responders after salvage chemotherapy also was poorest in the study arm (41%); it was unchanged in the control arm (53%) as compared with that of poor responders from the COSS-80 study without salvage chemotherapy (52%). The actuarial 4-year MFS rate of good responders was 73% in the study arm, 79% in the control arm, and not significantly different from that of the COSS-80 study (84%), although postoperative chemotherapy of good responders had been markedly shortened as compared with the COSS-80 study. The actuarial 4-year MFS rate of the study arm as a whole was inferior to that of the control arm (49% v 68%; P less than .1) and also inferior to the COSS-80 study (68%; P less than .01), indicating a failure of the employed salvage strategy in general and especially of the effort to restrict the use of the very effective but highly toxic drugs DOX and CPDD to patients resistant to a less toxic initial treatment.\r"

Instead, adherent light bacterial colonization without a biofilm layer was noted.

Clinical evaluation revealed that the HA granules become stable within three to four weeks, but there is loss of some augmented height due to settling of the material within the subpericranial pocket. The HA blocks maintained the augmented cranial contours, but 25% of them exhibited mobility. Histologic evaluation revealed no evidence of inflammation or bone resorption with either the HA granular or block form. The HA granules were separated from each other and from the bone interface by a layer of collagen fibers, and the blocks were also surrounded by a fibrous capsule. There was no evidence of bonding between the HA granules, and the bone-HA interface was separated by an intervening fibrous layer in all the HA granular specimens except for one in the one year group which showed evidence of bone formation in part of the HA bone interface. It was concluded that when used as an extracranial augmentation material, the nonporous HA granules were more stable than blocks; however, the blocks maintain a better contour.\r"

A questionnaire was administered to determine if patients with a NSD perceived that their quality of life was adversely affected. The incidence of NSD was 3.4% (one of 30) to LT and 0% (none of 30) to T.

Seventeen adult female Macaca mulatta underwent sagittal advancement osteotomy of approximately 4 to 6 mm. Six had 6 weeks of maxillomandibular fixation and eleven had rigid osseous fixation with no maxillomandibular fixation. Mandibular range of motion was measured by the change in the angle of the posterior aspect of the mandibular ramus from a closed-mouth and an open-mouth cephalogram. Parametric tests were used to statistically analyze the results. The results of this investigation showed that the animals who did not undergo maxillomandibular fixation maintained a greater range of motion in the early postsurgical period and obtained preoperative mobility by 12 weeks postsurgery. The animals who underwent six weeks of maxillomandibular fixation showed statistically significant decreases in range of motion when compared to the rigid fixation group at each period of time postsurgery, with significant reductions from preoperative values at 12 weeks postsurgery.\r"

The organism was more prevalent in homosexual (11 [30%] of 37) than in heterosexual men (19 [11%] of 166; p = 0.009). These data do not support an important aetiological role for M genitalium in acute urethritis, but suggest that it may account for some cases of NGU that become persistent or recurrent. The higher prevalence of urethral infection in homosexual men suggests that M genitalium may reside in the gastrointestinal tract.\r"
