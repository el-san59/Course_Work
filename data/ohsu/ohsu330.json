Most cases (82.2%) were reported from the homosexual/bisexual risk group. Other risk groups were less frequently represented, in contrast to the experience in the United States, where a higher proportion of cases in drug abusers has been observed, and in Africa, where heterosexual spread is far more common. The presenting clinical picture and length of survival after diagnosis were similar to those reported for other countries. Differences between projected estimates of the number of AIDS cases obtained with polynomial and logistic growth models emphasize the need for solid epidemiologic data on the number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus, the rates of transmission and the rates of progression to disease.\r"

In September of that year we surveyed all physicians in Ottawa-Carleton who were assisting at births to determine their opinions on midwifery. A total of 78 (74%) of the eligible physicians completed the questionnaire. Almost half thought that midwives should be licensed. Most felt that midwives should be trained as nurses first and should work under the supervision of a physician in hospital-based clinics or in a group practice with physicians. A small proportion thought that midwives should be able to practise as independent practitioners. Some obstetricians thought that legalization of midwifery would allow them to concentrate on high-risk obstetrics, and some family physicians thought this would make it easier for them to continue to be involved in maternity care. Those opposed to the introduction of midwives did not think the public would benefit, and some were concerned that midwives would reduce the size of their own obstetric practices.\r"

The rate of successful PTCA was 89%. Reocclusion occurred in one patient. The mean percentage of stenosis decreased from 86% to 11%. The mean trans-stenotic gradient was reduced from 41 to 11 mm Hg. The results suggest that in patients whose condition is stable, PTCA performed a few days after thrombolysis is a valuable alternative to more aggressive treatment with immediate PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "In determining optimal treatment for a patient conventional trials of therapy are susceptible to bias. Large-scale randomized trials can provide only a partial guide and have not been or cannot be carried out for most clinical disorders. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in individual patients (N of 1 RCTs) may in some circumstances provide a solution to this dilemma. In an N of 1 RCT a patient undergoes pairs of treatment periods (one period of each pair with the active drug and one with matched placebo, assigned at random); both the patient and the clinician are blind to allocation, and treatment targets are monitored. N of 1 RCTs are useful for chronic, stable conditions for which the proposed treatment, which has a rapid onset of action and ceases to act soon after it is discontinued, has shown promise in an open trial of therapy. The monitoring of treatment targets usually includes quantitative measurement of the patient's symptoms with the use of simple patient diaries or questionnaires. Pairs of treatment periods are continued until effectiveness is proved or refuted. The cooperation of a pharmacy is required for the preparation of matching placebos and conduct of the trial. Formal statistical analysis may be helpful for interpreting the results. The practical approach presented in this paper allows clinicians to conduct their own N of 1 RCTs.\r"

Of the Saint John group 9.0% were taking antihypertensive drugs, as compared with only 3.3% of the Quebec group (p less than 0.0001). Among the treated subjects 33% in Saint John and 53% in Quebec still had a diastolic pressure greater than 95 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Among the participants not taking antihypertensive drugs the systolic blood pressure increased with age, but the diastolic blood pressure increased only slightly up to 55 years of age and then decreased. On average the subjects in Saint John who were not being treated had a systolic pressure 6.2 mm Hg lower and a diastolic blood pressure 3.6 mm Hg lower than their Quebec counterparts (p less than 0.0001). This difference was observed in all the age groups and was not the result of the treatment of a greater proportion of the Saint John cohort. Despite the higher blood pressures and the smaller number receiving adequate treatment in the Quebec group, the rate of death due to coronary artery disease was 10% lower than that in the Saint John group. A bias in the data from Quebec may have influenced the magnitude of the differences between the two samples, but if present it should have underestimated the blood pressures in the Quebec group and therefore not have changed the outcome.\r"

Kingston, Ont., is one of those small cities, and of the facilities trying to come to grips with a disease about which much remains to be learned. In this article, Drs. Peter Ford and David Robertson outline their hospital's estimate of the cost, in manpower and money, of dealing with the AIDS crisis. The final estimate: roughly $700,000. Although most of the cost will involve one-time capital spending, they point out that there will likely be ongoing labour-related costs because of the special programs and increased manpower needed to deal with AIDS patients. Clearly, AIDS is no longer a big-city disease.\r"

Lynch syndrome I is characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for site-specific, early onset, adenocarcinoma of the colon, with proximal predominance and an excess of synchronous and metachronous colonic cancers. Lynch syndrome II (cancer family syndrome) shows these same colon cancer characteristics, but differs in that there is an excess proclivity of other forms of cancer, particularly of the endometrium and ovary. This article documents a family that shows features of Lynch syndrome II. Unique aspects pertain to a patient who is in the direct genetic lineage (whose five brothers manifested colonic cancer), but who developed carcinoma of the uterine cervix at age 34 and laryngeal cancer at 60. The pedigree also shows uterine cervical carcinoma among other patients at genetic risk. Her son, who is a nonsmoker and nondrinker, manifested laryngeal cancer at age 31. These observations appear to add new information about tumor heterogeneity in HNPCC.\r"

In our patient, although the rectus myocutaneous flap was a next logical choice, prior surgical scars precluded it use. The external oblique flap was successfully rotated and solved a difficult problem.

This screening was carried out in two of the high-risk areas, Yangzhong and Wun counties, located in central eastern and north China. The occult blood bead detector, swallowed and retained in the stomach for 3 minutes, was able to sort out the suspected persons by its coloration from sky blue (+) to dark blue ( ) on removal. The subsequent fibergastroscopy could make a definite diagnosis by biopsy specimen. A preliminary trial performed on patients with established cancers was 100% (18 of 18) positive for stomach cancer and 81% (13 of 16) positive for esophageal cancer. A public survey of the high-risk areas, screening 38,073 normal persons ranging in age from 35 to 70 years, showed positive results in 9204 (24.2%) persons. Subsequent fibergastroscopy carried out in 4023 occult blood bead detector positive persons showed 126 cancers (41 of the esophagus, 46 of the gastric cardia, and 39 of the stomach). Factors influencing the cancer detection rate were sex, age, and degree of positivity of the occult blood bead detector test. Seventy per cent (89 of 126) of the cancers discovered were in an early stage. The occult blood bead detector costs the primary screened person only 30 cents and may be practical for the large-scale screening of cancer of the upper digestive tract in developing areas.\r"

Increases in incidence in men, women, and the total from Group A to C were all statistically significant (P less than 0.05). A predominance of adenocarcinoma over squamous cell carcinoma in all cases was apparent in all the groups, but the data showed a trend toward a reduction in the proportion of adenocarcinoma and increases in the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. In contrast, an increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma was reported in the USA.\r"

However, the actual value of such pathology review has never been statistically evaluated or the need defined in a comprehensive manner. Pathology exclusions in 35 completed and ongoing Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trials were analyzed. Ineligibility rates ranged from 0% to 16.9%. The lowest ineligibility rates occurred in breast cancer, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, and gastrointestinal carcinoma protocols. The highest rates occurred in rare cancers such as malignant thymoma, endocrine carcinomas, and in the sarcoma-mesothelioma area. Simulated prototypical trials involving an aggressive and an indolent cancer were examined to evaluate the precision with which treatment differences would be measured when pathologically ineligible cases were included. Analysis of these models indicated that in trials in which the pathology exclusion rate is greater than 10%, slide review is prudent. When the exclusion rate is 5% to 10%, the necessity for pathology confirmation depends on the scientific objective of the trial. If less than 5% pathology exclusions characterize a clinical trial, routine pathology review is not justified. Routine histopathologic review for quality assurance in cooperative groups is not always necessary and may be eliminated in studies of the more common cancers. The practical value of reallocating limited pathology resources for investigative studies in cooperative groups is significant.\r"

  ".W": "NaUCC-2, a choriocarcinoma cell line, was derived from a patient who had a very poor clinical response to combination chemotherapy. Methotrexate (MTX) might have inhibited the antitumor effect of dactinomycin. To investigate this point, in vitro studies were performed to determine the sensitivity and uptake of MTX and dactinomycin (administered individually and in combination) to NaUCC-2 and three other choriocarcinoma cell lines. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) concentrations were studied as well. Although NaUCC-2 showed sensitivity to MTX and dactinomycin, which were comparable to the other cell lines when they were given separately, NaUCC-2 was unique in that the combination of MTX and dactinomycin was less lethal than dactinomycin given by itself. The uptake of MTX in NaUCC-2 was significantly higher than that in the other cell lines, and MTX also induced an increase in dactinomycin uptake in NaUCC-2. There was no significant difference in DHFR activity. Although additional studies are necessary to determine the mechanism responsible for this effect, these findings suggest that a mechanism other than drug uptake or DHFR activity must play a role in the drug resistance for choriocarcinoma. These findings also suggest that the most commonly used combination chemotherapy for choriocarcinoma, dactinomycin and MTX, may not always be the best method.\r"

Intrarenal arterial administration of 99mTC-labeled microspheres demonstrated a high renal entrapment ratio (97% of recovered radioactivity). The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of doxorubicin are different when it is administered in microspherical form. Peak plasma levels are lower (16 ng/ml versus 135 ng/ml) compared with treatment by a doxorubicin solution. Histologic studies showed that the microspheres were trapped within capillaries and small arterioles in the renal vascular arcade. It is apparent that chemoembolization with doxorubicin-loaded microspheres significantly reduces systemic exposure to the antineoplastic agent, and maintains intrarenal drug levels.\r"

Resection of esophageal carcinoma was absolutely noncurative in 64 patients (20%) due to invasion to the surrounding structures. These 64 patients were subdivided as follows into three groups based on the type of preoperative treatment: Group I included 16 patients without preoperative treatment; Group II included 38 patients with preoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (average doses: radiation 37.3 Gy, 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil [tegafur] 8.4 g); Group III included 10 patients who underwent preoperative hyperthermia (42 degrees C to 45 degrees C) combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (average doses: radiation 33 Gy, bleomycin 33.9 mg, or cis-diamine dichloroplatinum 75 mg, hyperthermia 6.2 times). There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative therapy among the three groups. The median survival times for patients in Groups I, II, and III were 6, 7.5 and 11 months, respectively. The 2-year survival rates for patients in Groups I, II, and III were 0, 15.6%, and 34.3%, respectively. The prognosis in Group III was superior to that for Group I (P less than 0.05) and Group II.

Fourteen patients received misonidazole during preoperative radiotherapy. Prospective cumulative survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 60%, 35%, and 17%, respectively. Original biopsy specimens and operation specimens were evaluated according to a histopathologic grading system based on an evaluation of the tumor cell population in terms of cell differentiation, structure, nuclear polymorphism, and the frequency of mitotic figures. The tumor-host relationship was also estimated by the mode of invasion, stage of invasion, vascular invasion, and degree of lymphocytic infiltration. A multivariate regression analysis according to Cox and actuarial survival were used to determine the relative contributions of the clinical and histopathologic parameters to patient outcome. The major results were as follows: (1) patients who were old (70 to 80 years) fared as well as younger patients (P = 0.9198); (2) tumor site did not influence therapeutic outcome (P = 0.1100); (3) there was an insignificant difference in survival between patients with M0 and M1 disease (P = 0.7130); (4) radical surgery gave better survival; (5) misonidazole administered preoperatively was associated with worse survival (P = 0.0147); and (6) the histopathologic malignancy grading score system was very useful for prognostication--the tumor-host score in the operative specimen was the strongest of all analyzed predictive parameters. Since palliation was excellent in all patients treated in the combined fashion, selection criteria should be wide for such a program, not the least since long-term survival is possible also for patients with very advanced tumors.\r"

Twenty-seven primary and 34 recurrent tumors were included. HBV antigens were detected in the tumor of the primary HCC in ten cases (37%): six (22.2%) had both antigens (Group I) and four (14.8%) had HBsAg alone (Group II). The remaining 17 cases were negative for both antigens (Group III). Intrahepatic tumor recurrence occurred in 17 cases; both HBcAg and HBsAg were found in the recurrent HCC in four of five HBcAg-positive cases (Group I). In contrast, HBcAg was detected in none of the other 12 cases (Group II, 0 of one; Group III, 0 of 11), and HBsAg in only one (Group II, 0 of one; Group III, one of 11), P less than 0.03 and P less than 0.02, respectively. Groups I, II, and III had extrahepatic recurrence in two, four, and seven cases, respectively. HBcAg was detected in none, while HBsAg was found in only one case (7.7%). The frequent detection of both antigens in the primary HCC and even in the intrahepatic recurrences suggests that HBV replication in HCC may occur more commonly than previously perceived, especially in the small HCC. Failure to detect HBV antigens in the extrahepatic recurrences suggests that the switch-off of the viral gene expression, particularly the core gene, may be an event related to the extrahepatic growth of HCC. HBV antigen expression in HCC is associated with more evident lymphocyte infiltration; this local host immune response may in turn result in a negative selection and expansion of the antigen-negative HCC cell clones. This suggestion is in accord with the fact that HBV antigens, particularly HBcAg, are rarely detected in advanced HCC.\r"

Four hundred thirty-two blood samples were obtained from apparently disease-free controls, from patients with benign and malignant ovarian tumors, and from patients with benign nontumorous and malignant diseases of the breast, lung, and gastrointestinal systems. The means, medians, and percent of samples that had elevated levels of NB/70K were calculated for each group of patients or controls for each assay. For all control versus malignant disease comparisons, there were statistically significant differences in all assays. For all benign versus malignant disease comparisons in the ovary, breast, lung, and gastrointestinal systems, there were statistically significant differences in all assays with the exception of the benign versus malignant gastrointestinal disease comparison in the NB12123 assay. Elevated NB/70K levels were detected in blood from ovarian cancer patients, almost all of whom had adenocarcinomas. Elevated NB/70K levels were also detected in blood samples from patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous, and clear cell carcinomas of the lung as well as in adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma of the breast. These results indicate that NB/70K is a marker for different pathologic types of malignancies.\r"

Treated animals received N-methylformamide (NMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) added to drinking water 1 week before carcinogen injections commenced and for the duration of the experiment. Primary tumors were detected by serial laparotomy under ether anesthesia performed at 2-month intervals and commencing after carcinogen injections had been completed. The average time to tumor onset was significantly delayed in rats receiving NMF and MSM (P = 0.0141 and 0.0398 respectively, Mantel-Haenszel test). In addition, fewer poorly differentiated tumors were noted in treatment groups. No weight loss or toxicity was observed. These findings demonstrate that the polar solvents significantly reduce the latent period to tumor onset in DMH-induced colon cancer and indicate the need to further investigate such compounds as chemopreventive agents.\r"

  ".W": "Over a period of 8 years 11 of 64 patients seen at Loyola University Medical Center with the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) also exhibited bone marrow hypoplasia (marrow cellularity of 25% or less) at presentation. The other 53 had normocellular or hypercellular marrow. Clinical features, hemograms, chromosome analysis, incidence of progression to acute leukemia or aplastic anemia, and survival in each group were compared. Using the French-American-British (FAB) classification, there were seven patients with refractory anemia (RA), one refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and three refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in the hypoplastic MDS group. Those with normocellular or hypercellular marrow included 22 with RA, nine with RARS, 12 with RAEB, three with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and four with RAEB in transformation; one had chronic diGuglielmo syndrome and two patients were not classified. Patients with hypoplastic MDS had lower hemoglobin levels (median, 8 g/dl versus 9 g/dl), more severe leucopenia (median 3100/microliter versus 4200/microliter) and thrombocytopenia (median, 28,000/microliter versus 75,000/microliter), and marked macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 107 mu 3 versus 97 mu 3). Nine patients with hypoplastic MDS had a chromosome analysis of the bone marrow, and all were normal. In those with normocellular or hyperplastic bone marrow, 22 such analyses were done, and seven (23%) were abnormal. One patient (11%) from the hypoplastic group and 11 (23%) from the normocellular or hyperplastic MDS transformed into acute leukemia. None progressed to aplastic anemia. With a mean follow-up time of 33 months in the hypoplastic MDS, eight patients (72%) are alive. In the group with normal or hyperplastic MDS, the mean follow up was 47 months, and 27 patients (50%) have survived. The two groups differ significantly in leukocyte count (P less than 0.0015), platelet count (P less than 0.0001), and MCV (P less than 0.0023). There may be a possible difference between these groups related to abnormal karyotype, but it is not statistically significant (P = 0.06). Therapy with pyridoxine, folic acid, prednisone, anabolic steroids, retinoids, or low-dose cytosine arabinoside was not beneficial in hypoplastic MDS. Hypoplastic MDS appears to be a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by marrow hypoplasia, macrocytosis, severe leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, low incidence of progression to acute leukemia, and unresponsiveness to conventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical and hematopathologic review of 66 patients with systemic mast cell disease (SMCD) was undertaken to investigate the frequency and the clinical significance of associated hematologic disorders. Twenty-two patients were found to have a second hematologic disorder, 19 of which involved the myeloid cells (ten dysmyelopoietic syndromes, five myeloproliferative disorders, three acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, and one chronic neutropenia), and three of which involved the lymphoid cells (three malignant lymphomas). A chromosome analysis of the bone marrow revealed abnormalities characteristic of neoplastic myeloid disorders in four patients. Five-year survival for patients with hematologic disorders was 28% compared with 61% for other SMCD patients (P = 0.004). Patients with hematologic disorders differed significantly from other SMCD patients in that they were about 7 years older (P = 0.039), and they presented more commonly with anemia (P less than 0.001) and constitutional symptoms (P = 0.007). These patients also had less frequent skin symptoms (P = 0.003) and urticaria pigmentosa (P = 0.018). By definition, patients with hematologic disorders had a greater percent of hematopoiesis (P less than 0.001) and decreased fat cells (P = 0.011) on bone marrow biopsies. A multivariate model demonstrated that the following independent variables were associated with the presence of hematologic disorders: low hemoglobin (P = 0.001), the absence of hepatomegaly (P = 0.016), high leukocyte count (P = 0.021), and the presence of pathologic fractures (P = 0.051). The frequent coexistence of SMCD with dysplastic and neoplastic disorders of myeloid cells is consistent with the concept that SMCD itself is a disorder of myeloid cells and that the mast cell may be myeloid in origin.\r"

In the literature contradictory opinions have been published concerning the clinical implications of subtyping, largely because of the different criteria used by different pathologists. This article is a consensus report by the Pathology Committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. The following classification of SCLC is recommended: (1) Small cell carcinoma. This subtype includes most of the tumors previously included in the oat cell and intermediate subtypes. More than 90% of untreated SCLC fall into this category. (2) Mixed small cell/large cell carcinoma. This subtype, which may be associated with a poor prognosis and response to therapy, contains a spectrum of cell types ranging from typical SCLC to larger cells having prominent nucleoli and resembling large cell carcinoma. (3) Combined small cell carcinomas. Typical SCLC elements are intimately admixed with areas of differentiated squamous cell or adenocarcinoma. This simplified classification of SCLC will facilitate uniformity in the diagnosis and further our understanding of the clinical significance of the rarer SCLC with variant morphologies.\r"

The isoenzyme was detected in 2% (seven of 335) of the patients: it could not be found in the serum of 300 matched, healthy individuals or in 56 patients with various benign hepatic diseases. Variant alkaline phosphatase is thus of little use as a diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma in southern African blacks. The reported prevalence of this isoenzyme in hepatocellular carcinoma ranges between 3% and 31%. Higher frequencies usually are recorded in populations with a low incidence of the tumor, and the lowest frequencies have been found in Chinese patients. Our finding of variant alkaline phosphatase in only 2% of another high incidence population fits this trend. Patients with tumors that secreted the variant isoenzyme had a significantly higher serum total alkaline phosphatase activity than those with tumors lacking this property.\r"

Two patients were found to have testicular scars and were dropped from the study. Nongerm cell malignant transformation of a teratoma occurred in five of the remaining 17 patients (29%), resulting in three adenocarcinomas and two sarcomas. Another patient developed leukemia. Metastatic disease most commonly involved the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, bone, retroperitoneum, and heart. Respiratory failure was the cause of death in 12 patients. Of the possible mechanisms of germ cell transformation into malignant nongerm cell tumors discussed, this study suggests that chemotherapy alone is unlikely to induce stem cell differentiation. The presence of mature, differentiated teratoma within the primary lesion may be indicative of a poorer prognosis.\r"

Of 81 testicular cancer patients treated for advanced disease at Vanderbilt University between 1970 and 1985, five developed a recurrent or metachronous germinal tumor 58 to 195 months after the initial treatment. Only two of these patients had received prior cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Four patients had unfavorable prognostic features when tumor recurrence was diagnosed. All five patients responded to salvage chemotherapy, although there were only two complete responses. The extent of disease was a significant factor in predicting response to salvage therapy. The possible mechanisms of development of a late recurrence of germinal neoplasms include the following: (1) malignant degeneration of mature teratoma to germinal malignancy; (2) growth of an occult testicular tumor not eliminated by chemotherapy due to the presence of a blood-testicular barrier; (3) development of a second primary germ cell neoplasm; or (4) late relapse due to persistent microscopic viable tumor with an atypical less aggressive biologic behavior. \"Cured\" germ cell tumor patients need careful follow-up beyond 2 years. At a minimum, these patients should be seen annually. Patients found to have teratomas following cisplatin-based chemotherapy should probably undergo more frequent evaluations.\r"

Monofactorial analysis revealed that sex, depth, location, histologic grade, cellularity, frequency of mitosis, and necrosis were significant prognostic factors. By multivariate analysis, only frequency of mitosis and depth of tumors were proved to be of prognostic significance. The prognostic importance of the frequency of mitosis as shown in previous and the present studies indicates that further investigation of the cell proliferation in patients with STS is required.\r"

Mean duration of PR was 43 weeks. Two patients were withdrawn from treatment after 4 weeks because of disease progression. Two patients, one of them in PR, had to be retired from further treatment due to toxic side effects. Main side effects were mucocutaneous dryness, skin atrophy, and skin vulnerability. Skin biopsies were performed on four patients 4 weeks after the start of treatment. The epidermis and the subepidermal grenz zone were found to be clear of mononuclear clear cell infiltration in three patients.

The next eight patients were treated with an initial 5-FU dose of 11.5 mg/kg IV on days 1 through 5, which was escalated to 13 mg/kg IV on days 1 through 5. No major responses (complete or partial) were documented. Median survival for all evaluable patients was 33 weeks. Toxicity was predominantly gastrointestinal and hematologic and was considered moderate. Our data suggest that 5-FU and ISO, at the doses used, were ineffectual in the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.\r"

The treatment consisted of intravenous administrations of dacarbazine 450 mg/m2, vindesine 3 mg/m2, and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 of each course. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks. Treatment was discontinued in case of progression after two courses, otherwise continued until progression or for a minimum of six courses. One hundred five patients entered the trial with 92 patients being evaluable. The response rate calculated after clearance by the Extramural Review Committee shows four complete and 18 partial responses, i.e., 24%, with a median remission duration of 23 weeks. Toxicity and subjective tolerance to this regimen were moderate, requiring 140 modifications of 642 administrations (22%). Main toxicities were nausea and vomiting (95%), leucopenia (70%), alopecia (56%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), and nephrotoxicity (17%). The discussion emphasizes some particular points of interest in the management of advanced malignant melanoma.\r"

Red dye solutions were infused at rates ranging from 1 ml/hour to 20 ml/minute. Effluent samples from each of 16 branch arteries were collected and dye concentrations were analyzed by means of a spectrophotometer. Low infusion rates, e.g., up to 5 ml/minute, showed streaming of the dye solutions and a nonhomogeneous dye distribution in the distal branches. At 20 ml/minute, dye distribution was much more uniform. These experiments are designed to simulate intrahepatic infusion of chemotherapeutic drug solutions. Theoretical considerations suggesting a pharmacokinetic advantage of intraarterial delivery implicitly assume uniform distribution of drug solutions to all perfused tissue. The in vitro data in this study suggests that this assumption may not be operative under certain infusion conditions. Slow infusion can lead to streaming and nonuniform distribution of infused drug solutions, which may in part explain the variability in tumor response in different tissue regions and also some observed toxicities, such as bile duct stricturing and fibrosis after intrahepatic infusions.\r"

In patients with extensive disease the total response rates were 70% and 86% and the median survival 7.6 and 9.2 months, respectively. There were no long-term survivors, and no advantage was gained from radiation combination treatment. The results confirm previously reported findings. In limited disease the complete remission rates were 68% and 64%, the partial remission rates 26% and 28%, and the median survival was 14.8 and 15.4 months, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences favoring either treatment regimen. The disease-free survival exceeding 2 years in the two respective groups was 6.5% and 25%; this difference was not statistically significant. A slight advantage of combined radiation and chemotherapy in the direction of better long-term survival was confirmed by the 4-year disease-free survival rate of 12% as compared with 0% in the nonirradiation group. This difference was statistically significant. There was considerable toxicity with both treatment regimens. The addition of radiation treatment to the chemotherapy most likely benefits patients with limited disease. The overall median survival of all the unselected 133 patients (nonrandomized included) was 10.3 months, and the cure rate was 3%.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four beagles received intraoperative irradiation (IORT) with 6 meV electrons to the pancreas and the duodenum. Intraoperative irradiation doses of 17.5 to 40 Gy were given. Billroth II gastrojejunostomy was done to bypass the irradiated duodenum. Six control dogs received only the Billroth II surgery. Two weeks postoperatively, irradiated dogs were given 50 Gy of 6 MV X radiation (external-beam radiation [EBRT]) to the pancreas and duodenum in 2 Gy fractions over a 5-week period. Dogs were monitored clinically and exocrine pancreatic function was evaluated using an N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-para-aminobenzoic acid (BT-PABA) test between 3 and 135 days postoperatively. Necropsies were performed on the dogs at 135 days postoperatively. The degree of gross pancreatic atrophy in the irradiated group was dose related. The mean percentage of normal acinar cells correlated with IORT doses and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) values (P less than 0.1). Weight loss was significantly greater in the irradiated dogs compared to the control (P less than 0.05) and the mean percentage of body weight loss correlated with the mean PABA values (P less than 0.01). In this study, the use of the BT-PABA test to evaluate progressive exocrine pancreatic function following IORT and EBRT showed an expected trend. A progressive decrease in exocrine pancreatic function in the irradiated dogs as indicated by plasma PABA levels may have been partly due to late radiation damage to acinar cells, secondary to vascular and ductular damage. At 135 days postoperatively none of the dogs showed clinical signs of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the plasma PABA levels were within the normal presurgical range. The progressive decrease in plasma PABA levels indicated a potential for the late development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The BT-PABA test could be useful for evaluating the progressive decrease in exocrine pancreatic function and residual radiation injury to the pancreas. Because the exocrine deficiency can be managed with replacement therapy, pancreatic injury may not be a serious complication after doses of less than 30 Gy IORT with 50 Gy EBRT. Data from this study are in agreement with previous clinical and experimental reports that the duodenum is dose-limiting for IORT. Doses of 20 Gy IORT or less plus 50 Gy EBRT for treatment of carcinoma of the pancreas may not result in serious long-term complications due to radiation injury of the duodenum.\r"

The suppression induced by AMLR-activated T-cells from patients with MM was compared to that induced by AMLR-activated T-cells from apparently normal controls. The addition of 10% unstimulated autologous T-cells from patients with MM resulted in minimal suppression of IgG synthesis (87 +/- 19% of baseline values for patients and 115 +/- 21% for controls, no significant difference). The suppression sharply increased when T-cells were preactivated by AMLR and then added in the same concentration to the IgG-secreting cultures (38 + 12% of baseline values for patients compared to 106 + 14% for controls, P less than 0.05). AMLR cultures were performed in the presence of adherent monocytes and after their depletion. The T-cell suppressor effect on normal IgG synthesis was unchanged after monocyte depletion. T-cells preactivated in the AMLR from patients with MM sharply suppress in vitro polyclonal IgG synthesis, and the activation of these suppressor T-cells is not dependent on the presence of monocytes.\r"

In this series 30 patients were examined cytogenetically on two or more occasions during the course of their illness. Ten patients showed a further karyotypic alteration from the initial findings, and, concomitantly, their disease progressed in severity including overt leukemia. These patients had a shorter survival (median, 2 months) after the chromosome reanalysis than the other 20 patients who did not have further karyotypic changes (21 months). Thus, the prognosis of patients with MDS can be predicted more accurately by reanalyzing the chromosomes after the initial analysis.\r"

  ".W": "The giant cell granuloma of jaw is a well-vascularised lesion comprising a mononuclear cell infiltrate with a large number of giant cells. It has been suggested that the lesion is reparative in nature, rather than neoplastic, and that the giant cells are phagocytes accumulating in chronic reparative granulation tissue. However, the nature of the multinucleate giant cells never has been established. One possibility is that the constituent giant cells are osteoclasts. The authors assessed expression by the giant cells of several osteoclast-specific characteristics: excavation of bone; motility inhibition by calcitonin (CT); and binding of osteoclast specific monoclonal antibodies. Two tumors were disaggregated and incubated on slices of cortical bone in the presence and absence of CT. Both tumors were found to excavate bone, a function unique to osteoclasts. The giant cells also were responsive to CT, resulting in cytoplasmic quiescence and inhibition of bone resorption. Two osteoclast-specific monoclonal antibodies bound all the giant cells in one central and six peripheral tumors examined immunohistochemically. These results provide strong evidence for the osteoclastic nature of the giant cells. The presence of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells forming woven bone in giant cell granulomas suggests that osteoblasts are present in the lesion. As cells of osteoblastic lineage are known to regulate osteoclastic function, it may be that osteoblasts account for the characteristic infiltration of osteoclasts into giant cell granulomas of jaws, either as part of a reparative response by reactive osteoblasts or as an infiltrate induced by osteoblasts of aberrant function, as suggested for giant cell tumors of bone.\r"

One of the stemlines in the right ovary (DI = 1.64) was also present in the ascites cells, whereas omentum metastases showed the same stemline (DI = 1.73) as the left ovarian tumor. The uterine malignancy contained three aneuploid stemlines. The highest stemline was associated with epithelial differentiation, but a metastatic origin from the left ovarian tumor seems unlikely. DNA fingerprinting analysis revealed a common change in restriction fragment length pattern in the DNA from all tumor localizations as compared with the patient's constitutional DNA. These results indicate that DNA flow cytometry can be helpful in discriminating intragenital metastatic disease from multiple primary tumors.\r"

Isoferritins extracted from neuroblastoma tumors and cells in culture show a wide range from basic (rich in L subunit) to acidic (rich in H subunit) isoferritins. Total ferritin is a combination of basic and acidic isoferritins. Forty-four serum samples from 25 patients with neuroblastoma were measured for basic and acidic isoferritin levels by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to liver (basic) ferritin and HeLa (acidic) ferritin. Normal ranges for basic and acidic serum ferritins were 7 to 142 ng/ml (median, 30 ng/ml) and 0 to 12 ng/ml (median, 3.4), respectively. Basic ferritins in the 44 neuroblastoma sera ranged from 0 to 1460 ng/ml, and acidic ferritins, 0 to 40 ng/ml. Sera with high levels of acidic ferritins always had increased basic ferritins. Thus, acidic/basic ferritin ratios were nearly constant, less than 0.3 in all sera. There was a significant linear correlation between basic and acidic isoferritins (r = 0.833). These results suggest that neuroblastoma tumors produce both basic and acidic isoferritins and release them into circulation. However, there is no acidic ferritinemia not accompanied by basic ferritinemia. Therefore, the commercial assay for basic isoferritin currently seems sufficient for clinical prognostic purposes.\r"

Although 80% of the patients were rated by physicians as having \"excellent\" or \"good\" functional status, no relationship was found between these global ratings and psychometric measures. Although the affected site was the posterior fossa, deficits also involved higher cortical function. These findings indicate the need for further evaluation of treatment effects and the provision of intervention for survivors.\r"

This was followed by a palliative and incomplete resection of an involved ileal segment. The patient did not receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy. He is now alive 8 years after diagnosis without evidence of malignancy. This case represents spontaneous regression of malignant melanoma of the small intestine that is considered either a primary intestinal tumor or a metastatic tumor from an occult regressed primary. The latter assumption makes this case unique in that spontaneous regression occurred twice, once in the occult primary lesion and once in the intestinal metastases.\r"

Complete data were collected on 32 out of 44. Four patients were withdrawn because of angiographically normal coronary arteries; seven, because of unsuccessful IMA cannulation; and one, because of an anaphylaxis-like reaction to ioxaglate. No other serious adverse effects were seen with either agent. The major endpoints were patient and physician assessments of discomfort, rated independently on a 4-point scale. Ioxaglate caused significantly less discomfort (n = 17, median rating of \"mild discomfort\") than did diatrizoate (n = 15, median rating of \"severe discomfort\"; P less than 0.01); this effect was independent of patient sex, the number of injections, and the volume of dye injected. Radiographic quality was good with both agents. We conclude that ioxaglate is much better tolerated than diatrizoate during angiography of the IMA.\r"

  ".W": "Volume measurements obtained with an impedance catheter (impedance volume measurements) have been used previously in determining pressure-volume relationships in the right and left ventricles and in the right atrium. The purpose of the present study was to determine the utility of impedance volume techniques in the assessment of aortic pressure-volume relationships in animals and humans. Experiments to develop this methodology were first performed in ten anesthetized dogs, with simultaneous measurements of aortic pressure (micromanometer), diameter (ultrasonic crystals), and impedance volume. Transient (20 sec) inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion and nitroprusside infusion resulted in a reproducible series of aortic pressure-volume and pressure-diameter points. In each case changes in impedance volume closely paralleled changes in diameter. From the wide range of pressure-volume points, it was possible to construct pressure-volume plots for a single cardiac cycle, as well as longer loops over a 20-40 mm Hg pressure range. End-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume points could subsequently be identified, which outlined a more precise pressure-volume relationship that was linear in six cases and curvilinear in four cases, depending on the level of aortic pressure. We extended these techniques to human subjects undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Studies using the impedance catheter in the aorta were performed in 11 patients. Aortic pressure-volume curves were elicited during Valsalva maneuver to obtain data over a range wider than that of a single cardiac cycle. Measurements of relative volume were calibrated with simultaneous M-mode echocardiography in three patients. We conclude that pressure-volume relationships in the aorta can be assessed with impedance volume techniques, making possible in vivo measurements of arterial compliance. Potential nonlinearities in aortic P-V relationships require that the assessment of aortic compliance encompass as much as possible of the physiologic range of pressure and volume.\r"

Satisfactory ventricular pacing was achieved in 19 patients at thresholds between 0.5 and 4.0 mA (median 2.0 mA). The threshold increased by 1 mA during long-term pacing (8-24 hr). Attempts to use the pacemaker were abandoned when short runs of ventricular tachycardia developed upon introduction, while an exceptionally high threshold was observed in another patient.

When pulmonary vascular tone was raised to a high steady level, direct electrical stimulation of the forebrain elicited a biphasic change in lobar arterial pressure. The response was characterized by an initial transient increase in lobar arterial pressure that was followed by a prolonged secondary decrease in pressure. When a delay coil was added to the extracorporeal perfusion circuit, the secondary vasodilator response was separated into initial brief and delayed prolonged components, suggesting that it was mediated in part by the release of a humoral factor. The entire response to forebrain stimulation was abolished by cervical cord section or freezing. The initial constrictor response and early brief dilator response were not blocked by classic pharmacological blocking agents. The delayed humorally mediated vasodilator response was blocked by propranolol or ICI 118551, indicating that it was mediated by a circulating factor with beta 2-stimulating properties. The delayed vasodilator response was associated with a large increase in arterial epinephrine levels, and this rise in plasma epinephrine was not altered by propranolol. The present data suggest that electrical stimulation of the forebrain causes a prolonged pulmonary vasodilator response that is mediated by way of a descending pathway, which results in a large rise in arterial epinephrine levels.\r"

We have previously shown that in the ischemic dog myocardium the level of a messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for a protein with migration characteristics similar to heat shock/stress protein 71 increases. Using a human heat-shock protein (hHSP) 70 genomic clone and anti-HSP70 antibodies as probes, we demonstrate in this report that heart stress protein (SP) 71 mRNA and its translational products (71 kDa polypeptides) are members of the stress protein family. In rabbit hearts, the ischemia-induced mRNAs translate into three isoforms with different isoelectric points (6.0, 6.1, and 6.15), in contrast to dog heart mRNA that translates into a protein with a pI of 5.8. The levels of SP71 mRNA in the dog and rabbit ischemic myocardium increased by sixfold and 18-fold, respectively. In the same samples, the levels of creatine kinase M mRNA decreased by about 40%, whereas those of myosin heavy chain mRNA remain unaltered. Our comparative analysis of three different mRNAs indicates that ischemia manifests its effects by differentially changing the levels of specific mRNAs coding for proteins with separate and distinct roles in the cell.\r"

Under dilated conditions, the vascular resistances (RVR) of the isolated kidneys of young and adult SHR were similar to WKY. Morphometric measurements of renal vasculature indicated that the cross-sectional area of the intima and adventitia and its subcomponents were similar in adult SHR and WKY. With the exception of the preglomerular arterioles, all the renal arteries of adult SHR exhibited elevated cross-sectional quantities of total media, medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and extracellular space. Analysis of the SMCs indicated the presence of increased numbers of SMC layers and/or an increase in the SMC volume-to-surface area ratio in arteries sampled from adult SHR. Vascular contraction produced by infusing norepinephrine, BaCl2, angiotensin II, or by stimulating the renal nerves elevated the RVR to a greater degree in adult SHR than in WKY. The sensitivity of the renal vasculature to the various contractile agents was similar in adult SHR and WKY. When compared with WKY, prehypertensive SHR also exhibited increased cross-sectional quantities of arterial media and elevated amplitudes of RVR change in response to norepinephrine and renal nerve stimulation. However, the vascular contractile sensitivity to norepinephrine was reduced. Our results indicate that renovascular wall thickening and the hypercontractile reactivity associated with such a change precedes hypertension in SHR. In prehypertensive SHR, elevations in RVR might be counterbalanced by a decreased norepinephrine sensitivity. An increase in the norepinephrine contractile sensitivity and further vascular thickening with age could elevate the RVR and establish hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the renal blood vessels of 21-week-old Wistar-Kyoto spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibited thicker vascular walls than age matched Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. Morphometric analysis of the relaxed renovasculature revealed an increase in the cross-sectional area of the media, which in most cases was associated with an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers. To test if these structural changes occur in the absence of raised blood pressure, hydralazine was administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive controls prior to and during pregnancy (100 ml/l drinking water), and to the newborn males up to 21 weeks of age (16.9 mg/kg/day by gavage until weaning followed by 100 mg/l in the drinking water). Treated animals were compared with untreated rats. Treatment prevented hypertension development in spontaneously hypertensive rats but did not alter the structural changes found in untreated animals with hypertension. At 21 weeks of age, hydralazine-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats had similar wall-to-lumen area ratios, medial cross-sectional areas and numbers of medial smooth muscle layers as untreated hypertensive rats while these parameters were greater in treated and untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats than in either treated or untreated normotensive controls. Withdrawal of hydralazine from 26-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats that had been treated in utero and postnatally and had normal blood pressures throughout life resulted in the rapid onset of hypertension. Our results show that renal vascular wall thickening in spontaneously hypertensive rats occurs in the absence of high blood pressure and therefore is not a secondary effect of raised blood pressure.\r"

In this study, heat-shocked hearts were examined for evidence of protection during ischemia and reperfusion. Rats were exposed to 15 minutes of 42 degrees C hyperthermia. Twenty-four hours later their hearts were isolated and perfused and the contractility examined during and after ischemic perfusion. No protection was observed during ischemic perfusion. However, upon reperfusion heat-shocked hearts had recovery of contractility within 5 minutes of reperfusion, while control hearts showed no contractility at this time. Throughout 30 minutes of reperfusion heat-shocked hearts had significantly improved recovery of contractile force, rate of contraction and rate of relaxation. Creatine kinase release, associated with reperfusion injury, was significantly reduced from a high of 386.8 +/- 78.9 mU/min/g heart wt for controls to 123.7 +/- 82.9 mU/min/g heart wt for heat-shocked hearts at 5 minutes of reperfusion. Following 30 minutes of reperfusion, ultrastructural examination revealed less damage of mitochondrial membranes in the heat-shocked hearts. Further biochemical investigations revealed that the antioxidative enzyme, catalase, was significantly increased to 137 +/- 12.7 U/mg protein in the heat-shocked hearts while the control value was 64.8 +/- 8.3 U/mg protein. Hyperthermic treatment, which induces the heat-shock response, may be therapeutic for salvaging ischemic myocardium during reperfusion, through a mechanism involving increased levels of myocardial catalase.\r"

  ".U": "88311411\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the relation between local myofiber anatomy and local deformation in the wall of the left ventricle, both three-dimensional transmural deformation and myofiber orientation were examined in the anterior free wall of seven canine left ventricles. Deformation was measured by imaging columns of implanted radiopaque markers with high-speed, biplane cineradiography (16 mm, 120 frames/sec). Hearts were fixed at end diastole and sectioned parallel to the local epicardial tangent plane to determine the transmural distribution of fiber directions at the site of strain measurement. The principal direction of deformation associated with the greatest shortening was compared with the local fiber direction in the outer (21 +/- 8% of the wall thickness from the epicardium) and inner (65 +/- 9%) halves of the wall. Although the fiber direction varied substantially with depth from the epicardium, the principal direction did not. In the outer half of the wall, fiber direction averaged -8 +/- 24 degrees, while the principal direction averaged -33 +/- 24 degrees from circumferential (counterclockwise angles are positive). In the inner half, fiber direction averaged 69 +/- 10 degrees, while the principal direction averaged -22 +/- 21 degrees. Therefore, while fiber and principal directions were not substantially different in the outer half, the greatest shortening occurred orthogonally to the fiber direction in the inner half. Normal and shear strains measured in a cardiac coordinate system (circumferential, longitudinal, and radial coordinates) were rotated (transformed) to \"fiber\" coordinates in both halves of the wall. In the outer half, normal strains observed in the fiber (-0.09 +/- 0.04) and cross-fiber (-0.04 +/- 0.04) directions were not significantly different (paired t test, p less than 0.05). In the inner half, more than twice as much strain occurred in the cross-fiber (-0.17 +/- 0.03) than in the fiber direction (-0.06 +/- 0.06). Moreover, the only shear strain that remained substantial after transformation was transverse shear in the plane of the fiber and radial coordinates. These results suggest that both reorientation and cross-sectional shape changes of myofibers or the interstitium may contribute to the large wall thickenings observed during contraction, particularly in the inner half of the ventricular wall.\r"

  ".W": "A simple theoretical approach is presented for estimating vascular distensibility of small blood vessels from noninvasively obtained pressure-flow data in the hand and forearm of human subjects. To the extent that Poiseuille's law applies to blood flow in these vascular beds, conductance (the reciprocal of vascular resistance) can be calculated from these data as the ratio of blood flow to mean arterial pressure. The fourth root of the conductance is proportional to the radius of the vascular bed. The slope of the relation between the logarithm of the radius of the vascular bed and the transmural pressure is proportional to the vascular extensibility (E), which, in turn, for small deformations and constant vascular length, is proportional to the distensibility of small blood vessel. Data obtained from the hands of six hypertensive subjects were compared with that obtained from six normotensive subjects, all with their vascular beds in a maximally dilated state. Also compared were data obtained from four normal subjects with their vascular beds in the resting state and when the beds were maximally dilated. The results indicate that 1) in the hypertensive subjects, the small blood vessels of the maximally dilated vascular bed of the hand are significantly (p less than 0.02) less distensible (E = 0.126 +/- 0.034/mm Hg) than those in the normotensive subjects (E = 0.272 +/- 0.047/mm Hg) and 2) the small blood vessels of the normal forearm at resting levels of vasomotor tone are more distensible (E = 1.00 +/- 0.38/mm Hg) than in the maximally dilated state (E = 0.51 +/- 0.08/mm Hg).\r"

  ".W": "The morphology, distribution, and configuration of coiled perimysial fibers of rat heart papillary muscle were studied. Methods included bright-field light microscopy of silver-stained sections, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and differential interference contrast light microscopy of unfixed and unstained specimens. Coiled fibers, elliptical in cross section, are arranged in a branched network that diverges from the muscle-tendon junction and is continuous throughout the length of the muscle and into the ventricle wall. Most fibers range in diameter from less than 1 micron to 10 micron and are parallel with the long axis of the muscle, although branching is common and oblique orientations are seen. Several myocytes are associated with each coiled perimysial fiber. Constituent fibrils (diameter, 40-50 nm) occur in bundles twisted within the fiber. Small satellite elastic fibers are parallel to the collagen fiber axes. Stereo analysis of the coiled perimysial fibers reveals helical configurations, as opposed to planar waviness, that become less convoluted or even straighten as the resting muscle is stretched. Calculations based on cross-sectional areas of fibers, changes in fiber configurations, and tensile moduli reported for collagen fibers of other tissues show that the potential tensile strength of the network of coiled perimysial fibers is sufficient to contribute significantly to the mechanical properties of papillary muscle. Detailed evaluations of possible roles of the coiled perimysial collagen fiber system as a function of passive stretch and contraction in ventricular wall, as well as in papillary muscle, warrant further study.\r"

We tested these hypotheses by evaluating the relation between aequorin-estimated myoplasmic [Ca2+], myosin light chain phosphorylation, shortening velocity at zero load (V0), and stress at various times after stimulation with histamine, phenylephrine, and depolarization with KCl. Agonist-induced changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] were associated with predictable changes in myosin phosphorylation. Depolarization required proportionally higher changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] for a given change in myosin phosphorylation. The relation between phosphorylation and V0 or steady-state stress was invariant with all tested stimuli. This suggests that Ca2+-dependent crossbridge phosphorylation is the primary determinant of the mechanical response.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the endothelium was examined in the response to aggregating platelets in cerebral arteries from normal and hypercholesterolemic animals. Male Yorkshire pigs were fed either a normal diet or a 2% high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In rings of basilar arteries from control animals aggregating platelets caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were significantly inhibited by apyrase, an adenosine diphosphatase and triphosphatase, but were augmented by methiothepin, a combined S1- and S2-serotonergic blocker. In quiescent rings platelets induced contractions that were inhibited by the presence of the endothelium; these contractions were significantly inhibited by methiothepin, but not by ketanserin (an S2-serotonergic blocker) or dazoxiben (a thromboxane-synthetase blocker) in the presence or absence of SQ29548 (a thromboxane-receptor blocker). Adenosine diphosphate but not serotonin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. In cholesterol-fed animals the endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets and adenosine diphosphate were impaired. These experiments indicate that 1) the endothelium inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of aggregating platelets in porcine cerebral arteries; 2) platelet-induced relaxations are achieved mainly by a purinergic mechanism, while platelet-induced contractions are mediated by activation of S1-serotonergic receptors with little contribution of thromboxanes; and 3) hypercholesterolemia impairs the endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets due to the impaired responses to adenosine diphosphate.\r"

The adenosine receptor antagonist [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine was used as radioligand. Binding of the radioligand to intact myocytes was rapid, reversible, and saturable with a binding capacity of 40,000 binding sites per cell. The dissociation constant of the radioligand was 0.48 nM. The adenosine receptor antagonists 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, \"xanthine amine congener,\" and theophylline were competitive inhibitors with affinities in agreement with results obtained for A1 receptors in other tissues. Competition experiments using the adenosine receptor agonists R-N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, and S-N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine gave monophasic displacement curves with Ki values of 50 nM, 440 nM, and 4,300 nM, which agreed well with the GTP-inducible low affinity state in cardiac membranes. The low affinity for agonists was not due to agonist-induced desensitization, and correlated well with the corresponding IC50 values for the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation by isoprenaline. It is suggested that only a low affinity state of A1 receptors can be detected in intact rat myocytes due to the presence of high concentrations of guanine nucleotides in intact cells.\r"

  ".U": "88311420\r", 
  ".W": "Acute volume alterations were produced in eight anesthetized dogs to determine if the contractility of the left ventricle is partially volume-dependent. Pressures were measured in the left ventricle with a micromanometer and regional ventricular function was measured with sonomicrometers implanted in the midwall of the anterior, lateral, and posterior left ventricle. Regional end-systolic pressure-length relations (ESPLR) were determined with transient venae cavae occlusions. The ESPLR data were fitted to a quadratic equation, then end-systolic lengths were compared at matched end-systolic pressures at multiple time periods after the acute load alterations. Bilateral vagotomy, carotid sinus denervation, and stellate ganglion denervation were performed to prevent reflex alterations in contractility. The heart was paced at a constant rate. In seven animals, dextran was infused intravenously over 77 +/- 23 seconds (+/- SD) to increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 5 +/- 2 to 13 +/- 3 mm Hg and peak pressures from 113 +/- 11 to 147 +/- 18 mm Hg. The end-diastolic lengths increased 14 +/- 6% in the anterior, 9 +/- 2% in the lateral, and 12 +/- 4% in the posterior segments. The ESPLR was measured immediately (77 +/- 23 seconds), early (3 +/- 1 minutes), and late (10 +/- 2 minutes) after initiation of the volume load. In all three regions, there was a significant time-dependent leftward shift in the ESPLR. From 1 to 10 minutes after the volume load, the regional end-systolic lengths decreased by a mean of 4-6% when compared at a matched end-systolic pressure of 96 +/- 10 mm Hg, and decreased by 7-9% when compared at a matched pressure of 139 +/- 20 mm Hg. The end-systolic lengths immediately after the volume load were not significantly different from the control value (compared at a matched end-systolic pressure) but were significantly shorter 10 minutes after the volume load. The leftward shift of the ESPLR represented a true increase in contractility and not merely a recovery from a transient myocardial depression. A similar leftward shift in the ESPLR occurred in four animals after release of a partial venae cavae occlusion, producing an acute volume load without acute hemodilution. Acute volume loads in four animals treated with propranolol also produced a leftward shift in the ESPLR, ruling out the possibility that a time-dependent increase in circulating catecholamines was responsible for the alterations in contractility. In five animals, the ESPLR shifted to the right after a transient (1-2 minutes) decrease in venous return.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of long-term pressure overload on the structural mechanisms implicated in wall remodeling of the right ventricle, a mild pulmonary artery banding was applied to rats approximately 2 months old, and the animals were killed 150 days later. The surgical procedure resulted in a 60% reduction in the cross-sectional area of the constricted vessel and a 52% increase in the weight of the right ventricle. The hypertrophic myocardial response was associated with an elevation in right ventricular systolic pressure (from 33 +/- 11 mm Hg to 71 +/- 12 mm Hg), right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 3 +/- 1 mm Hg to 10 +/- 3 mm Hg), and central venous pressure (from 2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg to 10 +/- 3 mm Hg). The 76% increase in wall thickness after pulmonary artery stenosis was the result of a 24% lateral expansion of cardiac muscle cells and a 44% increase in the number of myocytes across the ventricular wall. The intermyocyte distance was also increased by 22%. These cellular adaptations occurred with no alterations in total myocyte length, average sarcomere length, and volume composition of the myocardium. Ventricular wall area was decreased by 14%, which suggests a small reduction in chamber volume. Myocyte growth was accompanied by proportional expansions of mitochondrial and myofibrillar components, so that the ratio of mitochondria to myofibrils in the cytoplasm remained essentially constant. In conclusion, ventricular remodeling in this model of chronic pressure hypertrophy is characterized by increases in cellular diameter and number that would both tend to decrease the magnitude of systolic and diastolic stresses on a per cell basis and thus improve the myocardial response to a prolonged and sustained mechanical load.\r"

Simultaneous measurements of upstream to downstream pressure drop, red cell velocity, microvessel hematocrit, and vessel diameter and length permitted application of the principles of momentum conservation to calculate the forces acting upon a leukocyte during adhesion to the endothelium. For venules ranging in diameter from 23 to 49 micron, the ratio of force (acting in the vessel axial direction) to wall shear stress on the endothelium fell from 14.6 X 10(-6) in small venules to 2.3 X 10(-6) dynes per dyne/cm2 in large venules; reflecting the larger pressure drops and forces attendant to greater lumen obstruction in the smaller venules. The equilibrium force representative of a balance between fluid shear stresses on the leukocyte and those at its site of contact with the endothelium ranged from 1.1 to 76.1 X 10(-5) dynes for wall shear stress ranging from 2 to 25 dynes/cm2; with venules with greater wall shear stresses having the greater leukocyte-endothelium shear force. Within individual venules, however, the force acting on a single leukocyte varied inversely with wall shear stress, most likely due to white blood cell deformation, which leads to a lessening of shear stress on the surface of the white blood cell.\r"

This influx may not occur through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, since neither the extent of myogenic tone nor 45Ca2+ influx is affected by a concentration of 1,4-dihydropyridine (PN 200-110, 10 nM) that reduces tone and 45Ca2+ influx due to the depolarization by K+.

  ".W": "We studied the effects of exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure attributed to left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 24 +/- 10%). Twelve ambulatory patients with stable symptoms underwent 4-6 months of conditioning by exercising 4.1 +/- 0.6 hr/wk at a heart rate corresponding to 75% of peak oxygen consumption. Before and after training, patients underwent maximal bicycle exercise testing with direct measurement of central hemodynamic, leg blood flow, and metabolic responses. Exercise training resulted in a decrease in heart rate at rest and submaximal exercise and a 23% increase in peak oxygen consumption from 16.8 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 4.7 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.01). Heart rate, arterial lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio were unchanged at peak exercise after training. Maximal cardiac output tended to increase from 8.9 +/- 2.7 to 9.9 +/- 3.2 1/min and contributed to improved peak oxygen consumption in some patients, although this change did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13). Rest and exercise measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular end-systolic volume were unchanged. Right atrial, pulmonary arterial, pulmonary capillary wedge, and systemic arterial pressures were not different after training. Training induced several important peripheral adaptations that contributed to improved exercise performance. At peak exercise, systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference increased from 13.1 +/- 1.4 to 14.6 +/- 2.3 ml/dl (p less than 0.05). This increase was associated with an increase in peak-exercise leg blood flow from 2.5 +/- 0.7 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 l/min (p less than 0.01) and an increase in leg arteriovenous oxygen difference from 14.5 +/- 1.3 to 16.1 +/- 1.9 ml/dl (p = 0.07). Arterial and femoral venous lactate levels were markedly reduced during submaximal exercise after training, even though cardiac output and leg blood flow were unchanged at these workloads. Thus, ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure can achieve a significant training effect from long-term exercise. Peripheral adaptations, including an increase in peak blood flow to the exercising leg, played an important role in improving exercise tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

During supine steady-state bicycle exercise at 50% of maximum voluntary exercise capacity, the plasma norepinephrine concentration of six patients with congestive heart failure rose from 385 +/- 88 to 2,200 +/- 497 pg/ml, whereas that of nine normal subjects rose from 208 +/- 21 to 882 +/- 257 pg/ml. The change in plasma concentration in both groups was due to an increase in norepinephrine spillover to plasma without a change in plasma norepinephrine clearance.

In the normal subjects, cardiac spillover rose from 5 +/- 2 to 73 +/- 23 ng/min, and renal spillover increased from 76 +/- 27 to 275 +/- 106 ng/min. There is no evidence of a reduced reserve for overall or regional sympathetic stimulation in patients with heart failure. Reduced reflex responses in these patients are more likely due to end-organ refractoriness than to inadequate stimulation.\r"

Doppler color-flow imaging displays the transatrial jet, providing a new dimension with the potential capability of quantifying left-to-right shunt size. Twenty-three patients with atrial septal defect were studied by color-flow imaging and cardiac catheterization. The defect size measured by two-dimensional echocardiography, the maximal color-flow jet width in the atrial septum, and the maximal color-flow jet area in the right atrium were correlated with cardiac catheterization-derived left-to-right shunt size. Correlation coefficients were 0.57 (p less than 0.01), 0.67 (p less than 0.001), and 0.65 (p less than 0.01), respectively. Atrial septal color-flow jet width distinguished patients with less than a 2:1 left-to-right shunt size ratio (eight patients, jet width less than 15 mm in in all) from patients with greater than a 2:1 left-to-right shunt size ratio (15 patients, jet width greater than 15 mm in all). These results indicate that Doppler color-flow imaging can distinguish left-to-right shunt size in atrial septal defect accurately enough to influence decisions with regard to subsequent patient management.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of two-dimensional color-Doppler flow-imaging (2D Doppler) in the detection, localization, and quantitation of bioprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation is uncertain. Mitral bioprostheses, before and after the creation of transvalvular (n = 33), paravalvular (n = 17), or combined (n = 23) defects, were mounted in a pulsed duplication system (flow rates, 2.5-6.5 l/min; pulse rate, 70 beats/min). An Aloka 880 2D Doppler system (Japan) was used to image the regurgitant jets in the simulated left atrial chamber, analogous to images obtained with transesophageal echocardiography. Jet area was corrected to an estimate of stroke volume: 2D Doppler measurements were divided by [(valve effective orifice area) X (continuous-wave Doppler-determined mean diastolic filling velocity)]/pulse rate. Regurgitant fraction and regurgitant volume were measured by an electromagnetic flow probe. 2D Doppler correctly identified the presence and location of paravalvular regurgitation. In transvalvular and combined transvalvular-paravalvular defects, there were six incorrect interpretations, all having transvalvular regurgitant volumes less than 4 ml/beat. In the presence of transvalvular regurgitation, jet area, length, and width correlated linearly with regurgitant volume (r = 0.82, 0.80, and 0.68, respectively; p less than 0.0001) and regurgitant fraction (r = 0.62, 0.61, and 0.45, respectively; p less than 0.001). Correlations with regurgitant fraction were improved when 2D Doppler measurements were corrected for stroke volume (r = 0.78, 0.79, and 0.67, respectively; p less than 0.0001). Mitral bioprostheses with transvalvular defects were also studied at varying flow rates (3.2-7.5 l/min) and pulse rates (70, 90, and 110 beats/min). The correlation between jet area and regurgitant volume was improved with a second-order polynomial regression (r = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). Our conclusions are that 1) in this in vitro model analogous to transesophageal imaging, 2D Doppler accurately detects and localizes bioprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation; 2) in transvalvular bioprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, 2D Doppler measurement of jet area has a curvilinear relation with regurgitant volume, and correlation with regurgitant fraction is improved with correction for stroke volume; and 3) in paravalvular bioprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, correlations between 2D Doppler measurements and regurgitant volumes are weaker, possibly because of jet eccentricity.\r"

Analyses of hormone:sex hormone-binding globulin ratios or of estrogen:androgen ratios showed a similar lack of association with cardiovascular disease. Testosterone levels were significantly inversely associated with levels of blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride and body mass index. In contrast, the only significant estrogen risk factor associations were positive correlations of estrone with total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose.

  ".W": "To assess the potential of coronary collateral circulation to protect myocardium after occlusion of a coronary vessel, the mean coronary wedge pressure, the angiographic grade of collateral channels, and the left ventricular function were studied in 47 consecutive patients with mechanical recanalization of totally occluded coronary arteries. Coronary wedge pressure measurements were obtained 39 +/- 51 days (range, 2 hours to 361 days) after the presumed time of occlusion. The patients were divided into two groups: 31 with a coronary wedge pressure more than 30 mm Hg (group 1) and 16 with a coronary wedge pressure of or less than 30 mm Hg (group 2). Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher mean global left ventricular ejection fraction than those in group 2 (63 +/- 9% vs. 49 +/- 7%, p less than 0.001). Regional left ventricular function (artery-related area change) was also superior in group 1 compared with group 2 (47 +/- 11% vs. 36 +/- 10%, p less than 0.01). Global left ventricular function was significantly correlated to coronary wedge pressure (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001) but not to the angiographic presence of collaterals. The data suggest that a high coronary wedge pressure is associated with improved left ventricular function after coronary artery occlusion and that coronary wedge pressure more accurately reflects the physiological role of collaterals than their angiographic presence.\r"

  ".U": "88311435\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with aortic stenosis are susceptible to myocardial ischemia during hemodynamic stress, which may be caused by two mechanisms. First, vascular abnormalities inherent in myocardial hypertrophy may impair coronary vasodilation, limiting the ability to increase coronary blood flow to meet increased metabolic demands. Second, aortic stenosis itself may cause an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand during hemodynamic stress by decreasing aortic pressure (decreasing coronary perfusion or oxygen supply) and increasing left ventricular pressure (increasing oxygen demand). By decreasing aortic valve gradient without immediately altering ventricular hypertrophy, aortic balloon valvuloplasty offers the opportunity to distinguish these mechanisms. We hypothesized that aortic valvuloplasty would improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, especially during isoproterenol infusion. Nine patients undergoing aortic balloon valvuloplasty were assessed at baseline and during isoproterenol infusion (5 +/- 2 micrograms/min, mean +/- SD) before and after valvuloplasty. Valvuloplasty increased myocardial oxygen supply. After valvuloplasty, isoproterenol decreased diastolic pressure time index (DPTI) less and increased coronary sinus blood flow more than before valvuloplasty (-630 +/- 367 vs. -292 +/- 224 mm Hg.sec/min, p = 0.02 and 53 +/- 137 vs. 179 +/- 145 ml/min, p = 0.001, respectively). Valvuloplasty also decreased oxygen demand, decreasing systolic pressure time index (SPTI) from 4,135 +/- 511 to 3,021 +/- 492 mm Hg.sec/min (p = 0.0002). Valvuloplasty improved the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, increasing baseline DPTI:SPTI, decreasing aortocoronary sinus oxygen content difference (0.51 +/- 0.15 to 0.68 +/- 0.14, p = 0.005 and 96 +/- 14 to 78 +/- 15 ml O2/l, p = 0.002, respectively), and decreasing myocardial lactate production during isoproterenol infusion (mean lactate extraction fraction, -0.26 +/- 0.40 to 0.14 +/- 0.17; p = 0.01). We conclude that aortic valvuloplasty improves the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during hemodynamic stress induced by isoproterenol infusion. We speculate that the clinical improvement, which often occurs in these patients after valvuloplasty despite persistence of hemodynamically \"critical\" aortic stenosis, is in part attributable to immediate improvement in the myocardial oxygen supply:demand ratio.\r"

Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was inducible in all 35 patients during treatment with procainamide alone and with amiodarone alone. Procainamide and amiodarone similarly increased the VT cycle length (+68 vs. +61 msec), the corrected QT interval (+63 vs. +49 msec), and the ventricular effective refractory period measured at paced cycle lengths of 600-550 msec (+23 vs. +21 msec) and 400 msec (+25 vs. +23 msec). Procainamide had a more pronounced effect on QRS duration than amiodarone during sinus rhythm (+18 vs. +8 msec, p less than 0.01) and during paced cycle lengths of 600-550 msec (+32 vs. +23 msec, p less than 0.01) and 400 msec (+37 vs. +28 msec, p less than 0.1) but a similar effect on the QRS duration during VT (+32 vs. +29 msec). During combination therapy, VT initiation was prevented in only two (6%) patients. The combination therapy produced a greater increase (p less than 0.001) than individual therapy in all the electrophysiological intervals assessed, with the exception of the sinus cycle length. On each drug regimen, a cycle length-dependent increase (p less than 0.05) in paced QRS duration was noted (400 more than 600-550 msec).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability to record accessory atrioventricular (AV) pathway activation consistently may be uniquely beneficial in improving pathway localization, identifying anatomic relations, and providing insight into unusual conduction properties. For the purpose of recording left AV accessory pathway activation, an electrode catheter was specially designed for use in the coronary sinus. The orthogonal catheter has three sets of four electrodes spaced evenly around the circumference. Electrograms were recorded at low gain (less than 1 cm/mV) between adjacent electrodes on the same set (interelectrode distance, 1.5 mm, center to center). This provides a recording dipole perpendicular to the atrioventricular groove to enhance recording of accessory pathway activation while minimizing overlapping atrial or ventricular potentials. The orthogonal electrode catheter was used in the electrophysiological study of 48 consecutive patients with 59 left AV accessory pathways. The catheter could be advanced along the coronary sinus beyond the site of earliest retrograde atrial activation in 49 of the 59 accessory pathways. Activation potentials were recorded from 45 of the 49 (92%) accessory pathways accessible to the catheter (5 of 5 anterior, 8 of 8 anterolateral, 15 of 16 lateral, 5 of 5 posterolateral, 5 of 5 posterior, and 7 of 10 posteroseptal). Accessory pathway potentials were validated by dissociating them from both atrial and ventricular activation by programmed-stimulation techniques. During surgery, accessory pathway potentials were identified from orthogonal catheter electrodes in the coronary sinus in 14 of 16 accessory pathways (12 patients). Epicardial mapping confirmed the location of the accessory pathway, and direct pressure over the orthogonal catheter electrode that recorded the accessory pathway potential resulted in transient conduction block in nine of the 14 accessory pathways. Orthogonal electrode maps of the coronary sinus identified an oblique course in 39 of 45 recorded accessory pathways. Thirty-two of 38 left free-wall accessory pathways were oriented with atrial insertion 4-30 mm (median, 14 mm) proximal (posterior) to the ventricular insertion. In the remaining six free-wall accessory pathways, the lateral excursion could not be determined because either only the atrial end of the accessory pathway was recorded or activation of multiple pathway fibers prevented tracking of individual strands. The seven recorded posteroseptal pathways exhibited accessory pathway potentials throughout an 8-18-mm (median, 10 mm) length of the proximal coronary sinus, but fiber orientation was difficult to determine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The normal motion of the mitral anulus is associated with two phases of inflow from the pulmonary veins. The first phase (J) of pulmonary venous inflow occurs during ventricular systole, concomitant with the descent of the mitral anulus toward the ventricular apex, the extent of which is 12.8 +/- 1.4 mm. The end of the descent of the anulus occurs at the cessation of aortic ejection. About 100 msec later, a rapid recoil of the mitral anulus toward the atrium coincides with the onset of transmitral filling. This rapid recoil contributes to the displacement of blood from the atria into the ventricles in early diastole. The second phase (K) of pulmonary venous flow begins in early diastole, with its peak occurring about 50 msec after the peak of transmitral flow. During atrial contraction, the mitral anulus moves slightly (2.4 +/- 0.7 mm) toward the atrium and then returns toward its initial position within 120 msec. This motion coincides with the A wave of transmitral flow. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary venous flow and mitral anulus motion are markedly altered in comparison with normal subjects. In all patients, motion of the mitral anulus is either reduced or absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Findings during conventional manual CPR were compared with those during high-impulse CPR (rate, 120 cycles/min with a shorter compression:relaxation ratio) as well as during pneumatic vest CPR with and without simultaneous ventilation and abdominal binding. Aortic peak pressure during conventional CPR averaged 61 +/- 29 mm Hg but varied widely (range, 39-126 mm Hg) among patients. Although the magnitude of improvement was modest, the high-impulse method was the only technique tested that significantly elevated both aortic peak pressure and the coronary perfusion gradient during cardiac arrest. During conventional CPR, aortic pressure rose from 61 +/- 29 to 80 +/- 39 mm Hg during high-impulse CPR, and the gradient rose from 9 +/- 11 to 14 +/- 15 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.01. The pneumatic vest method significantly improved peak aortic pressure but not the coronary perfusion gradient. Simultaneous ventilation and chest compression created high end-expiratory pressure and lowered the coronary perfusion gradient. Abdominal binding had no significant hemodynamic effects. This evaluation of experimental resuscitation methods in humans shows that the high-impulse chest compression method augments aortic pressure over levels achieved during conventional CPR methods; however, the improvement in pressure is modest and may not be clinically important. Simultaneous ventilation as well as abdominal binding during CPR were associated with no benefit; in fact, simultaneous ventilation appears to adversely affect cardiac perfusion and, therefore, should not be used during clinical resuscitation.\r"

Balloon catheter-mounted intracoronary stent devices may reduce restenosis by improving luminal morphology and flow characteristics. This study assessed the effects of a stainless steel wire, interdigitating coil stent on restenosis in the atherosclerotic rabbit model. Fifteen cholesterol-fed rabbits with preexisting iliac arterial lesions induced by balloon deendothelialization were instrumented in one iliac artery with a 2.0-mm diameter stent after balloon dilatation; the contralateral iliac lesion was treated by dilatation only to serve as a control. The animals were given heparin with aspirin (60 mg) and aspirin every 3rd day until death. Arteriography was repeated 4 weeks after stenting, just before death. Tissue sections from stented and control arterial segments were analyzed morphometrically. Stented arteries had a significantly larger luminal diameter at restudy, whether measured by arteriography (1.38 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.35 mm, p less than 0.01) or from tissue sections (1.26 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.30 mm, p = 0.0001). Wall thickness of the stented segment was slightly, but significantly, less than the control segment (436 +/- 143 vs. 532 +/- 221 microns, p less than 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy of five stented atherosclerotic rabbit aortas revealed regeneration of a nonthrombogenic, confluent, flow-directed endothelium by 4 weeks after placement. Intra-arterial stenting may be of benefit in the prevention of restenosis by the preservation of a larger functional lumen and by a decrease in the neointimal hyperplastic response to arterial injury.\r"

In measurements from apex to base, minimum LVP increased (1.6 +/- 0.7 to 3.1 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, mean +/- SD); the time interval between the first crossover of transmitral pressures and minimum LVP increased (31 +/- 3 to 50 +/- 17 msec); the slope of the rapid-filling LVP wave decreased (74 +/- 13 to 26 +/- 5 mm Hg/sec); the maximum forward (i.e., LAP greater than LVP) transmitral pressure gradient decreased (3.6 +/- 1.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg); the time interval between the first and second points of transmitral pressure crossover increased (71 +/- 9 to 96 +/- 13 msec); and the area of reversed (i.e., LVP greater than LAP) gradient between the second and third points of transmitral pressure crossover decreased (101 +/- 41 to 40 +/- 33 mm Hg.msec). During atrial contraction, significant regional ventricular apex-to-base gradients were also noted. The slope of the LV A wave decreased (26 +/- 10 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg/sec); LV end-diastolic pressure decreased (8.1 +/- 2.0 to 7.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg), and the upstroke of the LV A wave near the base was recorded earlier than near the apex. All differences were significant at the 0.05 level. Simultaneous transmitral Doppler velocity profiles and transmitral pressures were measured at the 4-cm intraventricular site. The average interval between the first and second points of pressure crossover and between the onset of early rapid filling and maximum E-wave velocity were statistically similar (81 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 12 msec; NS); and the average area of the forward transmitral pressure gradient associated with acceleration of early flow was significantly greater than the area of reversed gradient associated with deceleration of early flow (133 +/- 36 vs. 80 +/- 46 msec.mm Hg; p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relation of the Doppler transmitral flow velocity profile to left ventricular loading conditions and diastolic properties remains poorly described. We studied seven adult mongrel dogs with an open-chest right heart bypass model in which left atrial pressure, representing preload, was varied by controlling blood flow into the pulmonary artery and left ventricular systolic pressure, representing afterload, was controlled independently by pumping blood into or from the femoral arteries. Heart rate was kept constant by crushing the sinus node and pacing the right atrium. Mitral inflow velocity profiles were measured by pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography at multiple left atrial and left ventricular systolic pressures. In individual dogs, the peak E-wave velocity increased linearly with increasing left atrial V-wave pressure at constant left ventricular systolic pressure and decreased with increasing left ventricular systolic pressure at constant left atrial pressure. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis of data pooled from all experimental stages in all dogs identified left atrial V-wave pressure, the time constant of relaxation (TL), and left ventricular systolic pressure, in order of decreasing significance, as predictors of the peak E-wave velocity (n = 82, multiple r = 0.87, p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analysis with the same three factors in individual dogs yielded higher r values (mean r = 0.89; range, 0.85-0.97), suggesting the presence of important interdog differences that were not accounted for by these three factors alone. When the values of codeterminant hemodynamic factors were kept within narrower limits, correlations between peak E-wave velocity and left atrial V-wave pressure (n = 35, multiple r = 0.83, p less than 0.0001), TL (n = 76, multiple r = -0.54, p less than 0.0001) and left ventricular systolic pressure (n = 20, multiple r = -0.59, p less than 0.005) improved substantially. In the pooled data, the relation of the peak E-wave velocity to left atrial V-wave pressure was shifted downward by an increase in TL (reduced relaxation rate), and the relation of the peak E-wave velocity to TL was shifted upward by an increase in left atrial V-wave pressure. Multivariate analysis also selected left atrial V-wave pressure and TL as the two most significant correlates of the velocity-time integral and deceleration rate of the E wave.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether the decrease in dV/dT solely accounts for the impaired myocardial conduction or whether passive membrane properties may also be involved, we studied 21 ventricular epicardial tissues from 14 beagles; six dogs received long-term treatment (3-6 weeks) of amiodarone orally, and the remaining dogs served as controls. Amiodarone therapy was associated with a decrease in conduction velocity (0.41 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.05 m/sec; p less than 0.01). There was a trend toward a decrease in dV/dT and a significant decrease in the space constant (0.69 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.25 mm; p = 0.01), of which the latter correlated closely with the decrease in conduction velocity measured in the amiodarone-treated tissues (r = 0.85, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the decrease in myocardial conduction velocity caused by amiodarone is primarily due to effects on overall resistance to passive current flow rather than effects on the inward sodium current.\r"

Therefore, two agents that block sodium channels by binding to this receptor are expected to compete for occupancy. Glycylxylidide (GX) is a deethylated metabolite of lidocaine that accumulates in patients on lidocaine therapy. In single, voltage-clamped cardiocytes, GX, like lidocaine, blocked cardiac sodium channels in a use-dependent manner. However, its kinetics of recovery from block were markedly different from lidocaine: at potentials between -80 and -100 mV, GX-blocked channels recovered faster and more completely than lidocaine-blocked channels but recovered more slowly at more negative potentials (-120 to -140 mV). If lidocaine and GX compete for a common receptor, then there are conditions in which addition of a \"faster\" drug to a \"slower\" drug will produce less block than the slower drug alone. At potentials between -120 and -140 mV, addition of GX (slower drug) to lidocaine always increased the level of block, but addition of lidocaine to GX decreased the block in four of nine experiments and did not increase it in three of nine experiments. Conversely, at potentials between -80 and -100 mV, addition of lidocaine (slower drug) to GX always increased block, whereas addition of GX to lidocaine reduced the level of block in five of 16 experiments and did not increase it in seven of 16 experiments. Thus, upon addition of more blocker, the sodium current increased in 36% of cases or did not decline in 76% of cases. These results can be explained by the modulated receptor hypothesis with two drugs competing for the same receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously that thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) are important mediators of cyclic flow variations (CFVs) in a canine model of coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury. The present study tested the hypothesis that a TXA2 receptor antagonist is more effective in reducing intracoronary platelet deposition at sites of endothelial injury and severe stenosis than a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. CFVs developed after placing a plastic constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in 51 of 56 dogs. Autologous platelets labeled with 111In were injected in 48 animals. Ten control dogs (group 1A) were killed after CFVs were observed for 1 hour at the nadir of coronary blood flow. Five dogs (group 1B) did not develop CFVs after placement of the constrictor. CFVs were abolished with SQ 28668 (2.75 +/- 0.36 mg/kg, group 2) and SQ 29548 (0.45 +/- 0.1 mg/kg, group 3), two different TXA2 and PGH2 receptor antagonists, in eight of 10 and six of seven dogs, respectively. In eight of 10 dogs (group 4), CFVs were abolished with ketanserin (0.66 +/- 0.12 mg/kg), a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. In group 2, 3, and 4 dogs, the respective drugs were given so that the minimal dose required to abolished CFVs was administered. In six of six dogs (group 5), a higher dose of ketanserin (i.e., 1.5 mg/kg) was used to abolish CFVs. At death, intracoronary platelet deposition was evaluated by calculating the LAD platelet accumulation ratio (111In activity in the LAD/111In activity in the circumflex coronary artery) in 43 dogs and, in 22 dogs, by microscopic examination of the LAD. A marked LAD platelet accumulation ratio was found in group 1A dogs at the stenotic site and in segments immediately distal to it. The LAD platelet accumulation ratio was significantly reduced by both the low and the high doses of ketanserin compared with group 1A dogs (p less than 0.001). However, the two TXA2 receptor antagonists further reduced the LAD platelet accumulation ratio compared with ketanserin-treated animals (p less than 0.01). Microscopic examination confirmed these findings. We conclude that SQ 28668 and SQ 29548, two different TXA2 receptor antagonists, reduce residual intracoronary platelet deposition associated with CFVs in this canine model more effectively than ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the response of briefly ischemic and reperfused myocardium to subsequent moderate reductions of coronary arterial flow. In mongrel dogs, a carotid to left anterior descending coronary shunt was constricted to produce moderate coronary flow reductions (50-60% of control) and to thereby reduce regional systolic thickening (measured by echocardiography or sonomicrometry). First, we demonstrated an abnormal response of reperfused myocardium to subsequent flow reductions. We performed two episodes of coronary shunt stenosis, with an intervening 5-minute complete coronary shunt occlusion followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. In a control group, the same two shunt stenoses were done, but no intervening shunt occlusion was performed. In the control dogs, repeated coronary shunt stenosis that produced equivalent perfusion reductions also produced equivalent declines in regional wall thickening. In contrast, in the intervention group (animals undergoing the intervening occlusion-reperfusion sequence between two shunt stenoses), the second coronary shunt stenosis produced an exaggerated decline in regional systolic thickening, even though the decline in myocardial perfusion was similar to the first stenosis. Second, we sought to demonstrate the mechanism of the exaggerated decline of the reperfused myocardium to subsequent moderate flow reductions. Again, two groups of animals were studied. Each group underwent two episodes of coronary shunt stenosis with an intervening sequence of 5 minutes of complete shunt occlusion and 30 minutes of reperfusion. In addition, one of the groups received an infusion of the oxygen free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase during the occlusion-reperfusion sequence. In the superoxide dismutase and catalase-treated animals, the decline in regional systolic function during the postreperfusion shunt stenosis was similar to the preocclusion stenosis. Thus, oxygen free radical scavengers blocked the exaggerated contraction decline in response to the postreperfusion flow reduction. We conclude that briefly ischemic and reperfused myocardium displays an exaggerated response to subsequent coronary arterial flow reductions and that this response is a subtle manifestation of postischemic ventricular dyskinesis, or \"stunning.\" The mechanism is probably oxygen free radical toxicity.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that a sustained flow reduction distal to a severe coronary artery stenosis may be well tolerated (after the initial insult is passed) because of gradual improvement in the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Studies were performed in eight sedated, closed-chest domestic swine that were instrumented with an artificial coronary arterial stenosis (80% diameter reduction). Hemodynamics, regional myocardial blood flow and oxygen, lactate, acid, and base metabolism were measured before stenosis and at 5, 20, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after stenosis insertion. Regional myocardial function (ultrasonic length sensors) was measured serially during 2 hours in three additional swine. After stenosis placement, endocardial and transmural flows declined (p less than 0.05) compared with flows before stenosis (from 1.54 +/- 0.37 to 0.73 +/- 0.24 ml/min/g [mean +/- SD] and from 1.44 +/- 0.31 to 1.19 +/- 0.25 ml/min/g, respectively). Thereafter, flows remained unchanged for the duration of the study. Similarly, prestenosis heart rate (135 +/- 7 beats/min), aortic mean pressure (113 +/- 17 mm Hg), and tension time index (27.1 +/- 3.6 mm Hg.sec) remained constant for the duration of the study. In contrast, regional coronary venous pH declined (p less than 0.05) compared with prestenosis levels (7.35 +/- 0.02) 5 minutes after stenosis (7.28 +/- 0.04), but it returned to prestenosis levels during the next hour. Regional coronary venous PCO2 exhibited a similar pattern (i.e., acute increase during poststenosis with gradual return to prestenosis levels).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The animals were instrumented to determine left ventricular volume from ultrasonic left ventricular internal dimensions and measure left ventricular pressure with a micromanometer. Studies were performed 1-2 weeks after instrumentation while the animals were conscious. Contractile state was increased by incremental infusion of dobutamine (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) and decreased by verapamil (10 mg i.v.) given after autonomic blockade. The 44 +/- 11 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) portion of the PES-VES relation generated by bicaval occlusion demonstrated a slight but consistent nonlinearity, apparent as a concavity toward the volume axis. This nonlinearity, present at all inotropic states, did not prevent the PES-VES relation from being well approximated by a straight line (r = 0.984 +/- 0.020, SEE = 2.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg); furthermore, the slope of the PES-VES line provided a sensitive index of contractile state, progressively increasing with incremental doses of dobutamine and decreasing in response to verapamil. The volume-axis intercept of the linear approximation of the PES-VES relation was 2.9 +/- 3.3 ml less (p less than 0.05) than the volume-axis intercept of the nonlinear quadratic fit. Thus, the linear PES-VES relation, whose slope is sensitive to a wide variety of inotropic states, is a reasonable and useful description of the left ventricle in the range of PES-VES points that can be produced by bicaval occlusion in the conscious dog. However, linear extrapolation of the relation beyond the range of data points may not be accurate.\r"

During coronary vasodilatation, PFC did not modify coronary conductance or zero-flow pressure. During autoregulation after PFC, the lower pressure limit of the autoregulatory pressure-flow relation was shifted leftward. This leftward shift occurred because endocardial blood flow was maintained at a lower coronary perfusion pressure with PFC while epicardial blood flow was unchanged. Endocardial blood flow was also preserved at 50% of control blood flow levels as evidenced by the higher endocardial-epicardial blood flow ratio with PFC. After PFC with 100% oxygen supplemented with room air ventilation, oxygen transport increased significantly when coronary perfusion pressure was below the lower pressure limit; the effect was most prominent in the endocardial tissue layer. Thus, PFC shifts the lower pressure limit to the left because of the increased ability of the endocardial vessel to autoregulate. Consequently, PFC can be considered a useful intervention for improving endocardial oxygen transport at low coronary perfusion pressures.\r"

An alternative hypothesis is that with a rise in intrathoracic pressure, mitral valve closure can occur but may be influenced by whether the lungs are inflated or deflated. To test this hypothesis, we placed a large-bore cannula into the thoraces of 11 dogs. Intrathoracic pressure was changed by inflating and deflating the thorax through the cannula while the airway was open, as well as by inflating and deflating the lungs with the thoracic cannula clamped. Mitral valve motion was observed with two-dimensional echocardiography from the right chest wall or esophagus in eight of the dogs. With a rise in intrathoracic pressure from thoracic inflation, all eight dogs showed closure of the mitral valve, while with thoracic deflation, all showed mitral valve opening. With lung inflation and deflation alone, however, the mitral valve remained open throughout the cycle. In seven dogs, with thoracic inflation, the peak gradient from the left ventricle to the left atrium was (mean +/- SEM) 18 +/- 4 mm Hg and the average gradient was 7 +/- 3 mm Hg, while with lung inflation alone, the average gradient was -1 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 vs. thoracic inflation). Thus, mitral valve closure, with concomitant retrograde pressure gradients, can be produced by intrathoracic pressure changes with accompanying lung deflation. With lung inflation alone, however, the mitral valve remains open, and there are no significant transmitral pressure gradients. We conclude that intrathoracic pressure changes can cause the mitral valve to close or to remain open, depending on how intrathoracic pressure is generated.\r"

  ".W": "Although stroke volume may decrease markedly after acute pulmonary embolism, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) usually changes very little, which suggests that compliance or contractility or both are reduced. To test the hypothesis that the altered LV function during pulmonary embolism is primarily due to reduced preload mediated by increased pericardial constraint, hemodynamics and chamber dimensions (measured by sonomicrometry) were assessed in seven anesthetized dogs during control volume loading, after pulmonary embolism (with autologous blood clot), and after repeated pulmonary embolism in the volume-loaded state. The correlation between LVEDP and an index of LVED volume (LVED area index) throughout a wide range of LVEDP before and after embolism was poor (mean r = 0.42; range, 0-0.82). However, the correlation between transmural LVEDP (LVEDP-directly measured pericardial pressure) and LVED area index (mean r = 0.78; range, 0.61-0.94) was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Similarly, an index of stroke work (LV area stroke work) correlated less well (p less than 0.01) with LVEDP (mean r = 0.43; range, 0.07-0.77) than with transmural LVEDP (mean r = 0.82; range, 0.68-0.92). LV area stroke work also correlated well with the LV area index (mean r = 0.84; range, 0.70-0.95). These data indicate that neither compliance nor contractility is substantially altered during acute pulmonary embolism. The altered LV performance is due to reduced LV preload as reflected by a decrease in transmural LVEDP. This study also demonstrates that LVEDP is a poor index of LV preload during pulmonary embolism, whereas transmural LVEDP accurately reflects LVED dimensions.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the technique of intraoperative angioscopy for delineation of peripheral vascular anatomy. Angioscopes with outer diameters of 0.85-2.9 mm have been used during 86 peripheral vascular procedures. Angioscopic inspections were performed during 68 femoral popliteal bypasses, four aortofemoral bypass grafts, one abdominal aortic aneurysm, two extra anatomic axillary femoral bypass grafts, and 11 other vascular procedures. We obtained useful images in 73 of 86 procedures (85%), thereby yielding 118 angioscopic inspections (53 arteries, 37 anastomoses, and 28 vein grafts). Changes in intraoperative management based on angioscopic findings included revision of five of 37 (14%) anastomoses, deletion of four of 31 (13%) completion angiograms, revision of eight of 17 (47%) in situ venous valves, and repetition of thrombectomy in six of seven (86%) cases. In 22 of 73 (30%) peripheral angioscopies, potential causes of graft occlusion were recognized. Complications from intraoperative angioscopy have included one anastomotic flap from intimal disruption that required anastomotic revision. Three small flaps, possibly resulting from angioscopic trauma, were recognized but appeared to have no clinical significance. In conclusion, intraoperative angioscopy provides visual assessment of luminal patency and anastomotic anatomy. This assessment alters intraoperative procedures in some cases and cannot be obtained by angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Between November 1978 and June 1986, 828 St. Jude Medical valves were implanted in 743 patients whose mean age was 57 years (range, 1-83 years) and who had been admitted to the University Hospitals in Basel, Berne, and Lausanne, Switzerland. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 456 patients, mitral valve replacement in 200, tricuspid valve replacement in six, double valve replacement in 77, and triple valve replacement in four. In 187 patients, additional surgical interventions were performed. Operative mortality was 1.6%, and the 4-week postoperative mortality was 4.0%. During a mean follow-up period of 2.6 years, the annual mortality rate was 3.1%, and the annual cardiac mortality rate was 2.1%. The thromboembolic rate per 100 patient-years was 1.3 after aortic valve replacement, 3.0 after mitral valve replacement, and 1.0 after multiple valve replacement. The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3 per 100 patient-years. Valve dysfunction attributable to thrombotic obstruction occurred in three patients, and that attributable to leaflet dislocation in one (annual dysfunction rate, 0.2%). Twelve patients developed infectious endocarditis, six of whom died. However, in four patients, reoperation and, in two patients, antibiotic treatment alone were successful in treating the infection. A paravalvular leak necessitating reoperation developed in 10 patients. In three patients, the leak was caused by infectious endocarditis. Reoperation had no operative mortality. In three patients (0.4%), a mild hemolytic anemia was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To identify the independent predictors of operative mortality, we examined 31 preoperative clinical and hemodynamic variables in 2,488 patients undergoing valvular surgery between 1982 and 1986. The operative mortality was 5.3% in 1,098 patients after aortic valve surgery, 6.6% in 1,107 after mitral valve surgery, and 10.1% in 283 after double valve surgery. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that urgent surgery, endocarditis requiring urgent surgery, previous aortic valve surgery, coronary artery disease, and age were independent risk factors for aortic valve surgery. Urgent surgery, endocarditis, age, coronary artery disease, and preoperative ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of mortality after mitral valve surgery. The predictors of mortality after double valve surgery were urgent surgery, age, preoperative ventricular ejection fraction, and tricuspid valve disease. Gender and the type of valvular lesion, procedure, and prosthesis did not independently influence operative mortality. Strategies to diminish operative mortality should include careful assessment of the risks and benefits in elderly patients, early operative intervention before deterioration that necessitates urgent surgery, and use of improved techniques of myocardial protection in high-risk subgroups.\r"

The 1-month mortality was 7.4% for Group 1 and 7.6% for Group 2. After 10 years of follow-up, the annual mortality was 1.5% for Group 1 and 1.6% for Group 2 (this difference was not significant). Sixty-nine percent of the patients in both groups continued to experience marked symptomatic improvement. In Group 1, 96% of the patients had been assigned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV before surgery; only 17% remained in these two classes postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In Group 2, 98% had been assigned to NYHA functional class III or IV before surgery, whereas only 20% remained in these two classes postoperatively (p less than 0.01). A comparison of preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic findings revealed that the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly reduced from 20 to 14 mm Hg in Group 1 and from 20 to 15 mm Hg in Group II (p less than 0.05). There was also a significant postoperative reduction in left ventricular outflow gradient at rest (from 79 to 6 mm Hg in Group 1 and from 75 to 7 mm Hg in Group 2) (p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who require surgical treatment, MVR alone or in conjunction with septal myomectomy offers significant improvement of symptoms and hemodynamic values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When these prostheses are implanted in arteries of animal models, the absorption-replacement reactions are inhibited by Dacron. To determine whether these reactions resulted primarily from transanastomotic pannus ingrowth, prostheses (30 mm x 4 mm) were constructed of three 10-mm long segments with Dacron segments on both ends and a middle polyglactin 910 (PG910) segment. The prostheses were implanted in the aortas of 15 adult New Zealand White rabbits. Resultant prosthesis/tissue complexes were harvested in triplicate at 2 weeks and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after implantation. Explants were photographed and sectioned for light microscopy and for scanning and transmission electron microscopy, which showed 100% patency with no aneurysms or stenoses. Inner-capsule thickness in the PG910 segments increased only during the interval from 2 weeks to 2 months; this thickness was statistically greater than either Dacron segment at 1 and 2 months (p less than or equal to 0.004 and p less than or equal to 0.0001, respectively). Proximal and distal Dacron segments did not differ from each other in thickness. Inner capsules of PG910 segments at 1 month were composed predominantly of myofibroblasts, whereas inner capsules of Dacron segments were composed of fibrin coagulum beyond the initial 2 mm of endothelial pannus ingrowth. These data suggest that transanastomotic pannus ingrowth is not the primary source of cells replacing absorbable vascular prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a complication of Carpentier ring mitral valvuloplasty that may occur only when this procedure is used to correct mitral regurgitation attributable to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. LVOT obstruction has not been observed among approximately 300 patients undergoing this procedure to correct mitral regurgitation attributable to other causes. Among 200 patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation who underwent Carpentier valvuloplasty, LVOT obstruction was found in 12 patients (6%). Five of these patients demonstrated severe LVOT obstruction during intraoperative echocardiography immediately after repair, which was corrected by mitral valve replacement in four and removal of the Carpentier ring in one. The remaining seven patients were followed-up for a mean period of 27 months with history, physical examination, and Doppler echocardiography. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was the echocardiographic hallmark of LVOT obstruction. Doppler echocardiographic and catheter-measured LVOT gradient paralleled the severity of the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The severity of the motion decreased, but still could be provoked, with amyl nitrite at late follow-up. Mitral regurgitation tended to recur at late follow-up. Despite the presence of LVOT obstruction and hemodynamic features resembling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at late follow-up, none of the patients had left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy, and early postoperative functional class improvement was sustained.\r"

Total experience at the end of June 1987 was 2,640 patient-years of follow-up. Prothrombin time ratios were reviewed for all patients (16,866 observations), and these ratios were found to be therapeutically low (median international normalized ratio, 2.6) and highly variable (lower 10th percentile, 1.6; upper 10th percentile, 3.9). During the follow-up period, there were no valvular thromboses; the 95% confidence limit for the risk of thrombosis (0.14 per 100 patient-years) is below that reported for other mechanical prostheses. Sixty percent of all thromboembolic events left no residual deficit, and 75% of all bleeding events did not require treatment. Only 11% of thromboembolic events and 7% of bleeding events were fatal. The linearized rate of fatal bleeding was 0.2% per year, and the linearized rate of moderate to severe bleeding was 0.5% per year. Five-year actuarial embolic-free rates were 92%, 84%, and 83% for aortic, mitral, and double valves, respectively. The low risk of valvular thrombosis and of serious thromboembolic events in the Medtronic Hall valve, regardless of the range and variability of anticoagulation, offers greater patient safety than other mechanical prostheses, provides a credible alternative to bioprostheses, and may be particularly relevant to third-world populations.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) after mitral valve repair by Carpentier's technique has been recently reported in the literature. To assess the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated 307 mitral valve repairs performed between July 1985 and December 1986. Incidence of LVOTO related to the mechanism of the mitral insufficiency and to the etiology demonstrates a direct relation to preoperative mitral valve prolapse (posterior leaflet +/- anterior leaflet) of degenerative origin. No LVOTO occurred after rheumatic mitral insufficiency repair regardless of size of the left heart cavities or of the prosthetic ring. Intraoperative and surficial two-dimensional echocardiography, color Doppler methods, and cardiac catheterization were used to investigate the mechanisms leading to LVOTO. Nonspecific modifications induced by reduction in size of the mitral annulus by the prosthetic ring (anterior displacement of the posterior ventricular wall and of the posterior mitral leaflet and narrowing of the mitroaortic angle) are not sufficient to explain the LVOTO. The association of mitral leaflets (composed of excess tissue and opposed to flow by a perpendicular position attributable to a narrow mitroaortic angle) and geometric left ventricular modifications (responsible for the superposition of mitral inflow to ventricular outflow) also qualifies as a mechanism for the induction of LVOTO after mitral surgical repair.\r"

Aortic, tricuspid, or both surgeries were simultaneously performed in 44.8%. The hospital mortality was 2.3% (two of 85). Ten patients were lost to follow-up within 2 years after surgery, and there were three late deaths. Thromboembolic events were detected in 18 patients (seven peripheral and 11 central with one death); nine patients had partial recovery, and eight had full recovery. At the time of the thromboembolic event, eight patients were receiving anticoagulants; four, antiaggregants; one, both anticoagulants and antiaggregants; and five, none. Thirteen patients (13 of 73, 17.8%) required reoperation between 1 month and 11 years postoperatively. The valve was replaced in 11 patients, and two underwent a new flexible ring annuloplasty. The cause for reoperation was regurgitation in eight patients (10.9%), for whom the mean interval between operations was 20.6 months (range, 1 month-11 years). Stenosis was the cause for reoperation in five patients (6.8%), for whom the mean interval between operations was 87.8 months (range, 4-11 years). We conclude that reconstructive surgery after 10-12 years of follow-up for this group of predominantly rheumatic patients has an incidence of failure of approximately 18% attributable to incorrect surgery (11%) and restenosis (7%).\r"

  ".W": "There have been few relatively complete follow-up studies of long-term mitral valve function after Carpentier-type surgical reconstruction. Between January 1980 and May 1986, 148 patients underwent Carpentier reconstruction for mitral valve disease (43% degenerative and 30% rheumatic). Operative mortality was 5.4% overall (1.2% for isolated mitral reconstruction), and follow-up (mean, 26 months) was completed for all survivors. Five-year survival from late cardiac death was 90.0%, as was 5-year freedom from postreconstruction mitral valve replacement. Postreconstruction mitral replacement was needed in eight patients, in only five for failure of repair. Follow-up echocardiographic studies on 83.2% (104 of 125) of eligible patients showed 92.3% were free of significant (3+ or 4+) mitral regurgitation. Freedom from mitral valve replacement or recurrent severe (4+) insufficiency was 84.4% at 5 years overall, but was lower for the rheumatic type of mitral disease than for the degenerative type (71.6% vs. 88.3%). At 5 years, 95.2% of patients were free from thromboembolism without the necessity for long-term warfarin (Coumadin) therapy. At follow-up, 95.3% of survivors had improved to New York Heart Association Class I or II. The functional durability of mitral reconstruction and consistently high level of freedom from late endocarditis and thromboembolic and anticoagulant complications support the value of the Carpentier method of mitral reconstruction for mitral insufficiency, especially insufficiency due to degenerative disease.\r"

The role of alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and occupational status was assessed in relation to the development of ON. The relative risk (RR), the measure of association between ON and the risk factors, was statistically adjusted for the potential confounding effects of other factors by the conditional logistic regression model. An elevated risk for regular drinkers (RR = 7.8, p less than 0.001) and a clear dose-response relationship was noted (test for trend; p less than 0.001): the RRs were 3.3, 9.8, and 17.9 for current consumers of less than 400, 400-1000, and greater than or equal to 1000 ml/week of alcohol, respectively. A significantly increased risk was found for current smokers (RR = 3.9; p less than 0.05). However, the cumulative effect of smoking was not evident. No increased risk was found for obesity or for heavy physical work. Regarding causation of ON, this study confirmed the consistent association with excessive alcohol intake and suggested the immediate untoward effects of smoking. The role of heavy physical work as a form of mechanical stress was not correlated with ON.\r"

An extraarticular resection of the right proximal femur and surrounding pelvis was performed. Reconstruction was carried out with a fresh-frozen cadaveric allograft of articulated proximal femur and acetabulum with the capsule intact. Excellent union at the junction of host bone with the allograft was demonstrated roentgenographically 12 months later. Nineteen months after the operation, as weight bearing proceeded, sudden onset of instability of the joint occurred without pain. Collapse of the allograft with partial dissolution of the femoral head and acetabulum were observed roentgenographically. Reconstruction was achieved with a prosthetic implant. The roentgenographic and pathologic features of the allograft are suggestive of neuropathic arthropathy; however, the possibility of allograft rejection cannot be excluded but seems unlikely.\r"

The average follow-up was 31.7 years. Static biomechanical frontal plane analyses were evaluated. The calculated increased force on either the medial or lateral tibial plateau, due to the malunion, was strongly associated with presence of a varus or valgus deformity at the knee (p less than 0.0005). A normal tibial plateau force for the malaligned condition multiplied by the time since fracture correlated directly with the amount of subsequent varus or valgus deformity at the knee (p less than 0.01).

Roentgenographic examinations were noncontributory. The lesions occurred in four distinct patterns. All were full thickness. Many of the lesions occurred on the posterior aspect of a femoral condyle, a location where they could be easily overlooked if the condyle were not examined with the knee in extreme flexion. Abutment of the tibial spine against the medial femoral condyle may be one cause of these injuries. The incidence of isolated chondral fractures was found to be higher than previously reported. A negative arthroscopic meniscal examination in a patient with symptoms and physical findings suggestive of meniscal abnormality should alert the physician to the possibility of an isolated chondral fracture.\r"

Of these, 54 were subtrochanteric and 210 were diaphyseal, while 123 involved the distal femur and 15 were at unspecified femoral sites. Fifty-eight percent of these fractures were caused by severe trauma. The incidence of femoral fractures due to severe trauma was greatest in young patients, especially for diaphyseal fractures, and showed a male excess. One-third of the fractures were associated with moderate trauma and were responsible for the rising incidence rates with age at all three fracture sites. These increases were greater in women. Eighty percent of patients 35 years of age or older with fractures due to moderate trauma had prior evidence of generalized osteopenia or a condition likely to cause localized osteopenia in the fractured femur. These data confirmed similar findings from Sweden, providing evidence for a relationship between osteoporosis and femoral fractures distal to the hip.\r"

Custom titanium plates were individually designed from roentgenograms and/or computed axial tomographic (CAT) scans.

At an average follow-up period of 33 months, all fractures united; there were no complications, including fatigue or loosening of the custom implants.

When the ESR was more than 40 mm per hour, recurrence was more likely. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from 11 abscesses. Curettage and antibiotics for six weeks were adequate for treatment in most cases. However, lesions larger than 3 cm in diameter should be grafted, and patients with an elevated ESR require more aggressive decompression and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Lesions within the neck of the femur pose particular anatomic problems and should not be approached laterally. All cases were followed to full bone maturity.

Eight adult patients with a strong familial history were evaluated, and their foot findings were remarkably similar. All demonstrated a marked cavus deformity that was secondary to a forefoot equinus associated with contracture of the plantar fascia and a varus deformity of the calcaneus. The muscle function demonstrated marked weakness of the tibialis anterior and peroneus brevis muscles, whereas the peroneus longus and posterior calf muscles were rated as good to normal. Based on the relative strengths of these muscles and the progression of weakness, the authors hypothesize that the deformity observed in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is secondary to the weakness of the tibialis anterior, peroneus brevis, and the intrinsic muscles, with their natural antagonists, the peroneus longus and the tibialis posterior muscles causing most of the deformity noted in these adult patients.\r"

  ".W": "The perichondrium of adult rats was dissected from the posterior side of the ear where a plane of separation can be easily found between the superficial chondrocytes and the rest of the cartilage. When pulled off, the perichondrium brings with it a cartilaginous strip adhered to its inner layer, with the detachment surface showing projections of broken capsular matrix (PBCM). The perichondrium and subperichondrial cartilage were then transferred as autogeneic grafts to preformed muscle pockets of the abdominal wall and to everted vein chambers placed free in the iliac blood flow. During a period of one to 12 days, chondrogenesis was studied in the grafts and in the graft bed areas next to subperichondrial cartilage. When the perichondrium was placed into a muscular pouch, wherein perichondrocytes survived and a prominent vascular ingrowth in the graft bed was observed, the presence of two types of newly formed cartilage was demonstrated (Types I and II). These types showed differences in their location, time of appearance, and microscopic characteristics. Type I neocartilage appeared in the inner layer of the perichondrium on the third or fourth day after grafting; at this time the cells, surrounded by a well-defined capsular matrix, were large, darkly stained, and highly electron dense. Type II neocartilage, separated from Type I by the PBCM, appeared in the graft bed area located within perichondrial folds on the sixth or seventh day after implantation. Their cells showed a poorly defined capsular matrix and were smaller, lighter stained, and less electron dense than those of Type I. When the perichondrium was transplanted to everted vein chambers placed in the iliac blood flow, wherein perichondrocytes survived and vascular ingrowth from the graft bed was not present, Type I neocartilage was formed but Type II was not. The morphologic and histoautoradiographic findings in these studies suggest that Type I cells come from perichondrocytes of the inner perichondrial layer, whereas Type II cells originate from the undifferentiated perivascular mesenchymal cells of the graft bed.\r"

  ".W": "The present study suggests that bonding does not vary in hydroxyapatite (HA) with different sintering temperatures implanted in bone tissue. The apparent unimportance of strict temperature regulation greatly simplifies HA processing. Three samples of HA (15 mm x 10 mm x 2 mm, abraded with 2000 alumina powder), of which sintering temperatures and microporosity were 800 degrees (45%), 1000 degrees (4.8%), and 1200 degrees (0.4%), respectively, were prepared. They were implanted into the metaphysis of tibia of mature male rabbits. Segments of the tibia containing the HA were excised and prepared for the detaching test. The failure load, when an implant detached from the bone or the bone broke, was then measured. Failure loads in HA (800 degrees), HA (1000 degrees), and HA (1200 degrees) ten weeks after implantation did not differ. Those in HA (800 degrees), HA (1000 degrees), and HA (1200 degrees) 25 weeks after implantation were 2.58 +/- 1.88 kg, 6.46 +/- 1.43 kg, and 6.50 +/- 2.71 kg, respectively. The failure load in HA (800 degrees) versus HA (1200 degrees) and that in HA (800 degrees) versus HA (1000 degrees) differed significantly (p less than 0.05). The lower failure load of HA (800 degrees) 25 weeks after implantation can be explained by its weakened mechanical strength due to high porosity. Bonding between bone tissue and three types of HA did not vary as observed by contact microradiography, Giemsa surface staining, and scanning electron microanalyzer-energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer.\r"

The soft-tissue response to carbon fiber braid substituting for lateral collateral ligament in three human knees and for the anterior cruciate ligament in one was examined 12-42 months after surgery. An advanced stage of maturity of the composite structure was particularly evident by dense bundles of collagen in one of the collateral ligaments and in the substitute for the anterior cruciate ligament. Associated with the newly formed collagen the carbon fibril initially formed unique carbon collagen of composite structural units. Eventually, subsidence of the fibroblast response was accompanied by an increase in density and width of the collagen fibers and by a loss of the configuration of the carbon-collagen units. Even the mature collagenous structure was not comparable to the natural ligament.\r"

Cybex testing of the elbow flexion by applying an eccentric load demonstrated that strength and endurance in the repaired dominant arm were roughly equal to the noninjured, nondominant arm, but that strength and endurance of the repaired nondominant arm were only 64% and 50%, respectively, of the noninjured dominant arm.

In a similar fashion, the total lymphocyte count became significantly depressed in 92%. The postoperative complications were clearly more extensive in patients who were malnourished and immune-deficient using these criteria--15 patients with urinary tract infections, four patients with bacterial sepsis, four patients with wound infections, and four patients with pneumonia (vs. one with a wound infection in the adequately nourished group). The length of hospitalization following the second operative procedure was significantly longer in the malnourished group: 16.2 days versus 12.4 days (p less than 0.05). The main purpose of this study is to create awareness of the ongoing nutritional demands placed on patients treated by two-stage spinal reconstruction surgical procedures. More aggressive nutritional intervention can reduce postoperative complications and length of hospital stay and improve the speed of functional recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Seven adults with displaced radial head fractures had concurrent dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. Because support of the radius was lost at both the elbow and wrist, proximal migration of the radius from 5 to 10 mm occurred. Different types of fractures were classified to designate the best method of restoring radial length to prevent chronic wrist pain and stiffness. Type I fractures had large displaced radial head fragments with minimal or no comminution and amenable to interfragmentary fixation. Type II fractures had severe comminution requiring radial head excision and prosthetic replacement. Type III were old injuries with irreducible proximal migration of the radius managed by ulnar shortening and radial head prosthetic replacement. There were three Type I, two Type II, and two Type III fractures. Results of treatment were graded as 3, excellent; 2, good; 1, fair; and 1, poor. The three excellent results were in patients in which restoration of radial length was achieved within one week of injury. Suboptimal results occurred in the remaining four patients when definitive surgery was delayed four to ten weeks. The poor result was in a patient treated only by radial head excision and who refused further surgery. Recommendations include meticulous clinical and roentgenographic examination of the distal radioulnar joint in all patients with displaced radial head fractures. Preservation of the radial head with anatomic reduction and rigid internal fixation is preferred, but radial head replacement may be necessary in cases with extensive comminution. Radial head excision alone, though contraindicated, may be restructured by ulnar shortening and radial head prosthetic replacement.\r"

The routine use of fluoroscopy and placement of the fixation pins no closer than 8 mm (or one-third the radius of the femoral head) from the subchondral bone will leave a safe, workable margin. Confirmation of subchondral location after the procedure can be done with fluoroscopy. With the leg in maximal internal rotation, the fluoroscopic unit is rotated from anteroposterior (AP) to lateral under continuous monitoring to detect anterolateral and posteromedial quadrant penetrations. With the fluoroscopic unit in the lateral position, the foot is externally rotated 90 degrees, again under continuous monitoring, to visualize the anteromedial and posterolateral quadrants. If the femoral head cannot be well-visualized in the lateral view, use of a lateral x-ray machine and AP fluoroscopy can be helpful. Another useful technique when the head cannot be well-visualized is the injection of contrast medium through a cannulated screw.\r"

  ".W": "A histologic and microradiographic analysis was performed on 90 retrieved human noncemented porous-coated total joint implants recovered from 58 patients. The specimens included 62 total knee components from 34 patients and 28 total hip components from 24 patients. All components were inserted without the use of bone cement, and in no case was the retrieved component removed due to clinically or roentgenographically apparent loosening. Approximately 92% of the total knee components and 93% of the total hip components had been in situ at least six weeks; 70% of the knee components and more than 50% of the hip components had been functional for at least nine months. The histologic sections and microradiographs revealed varying amounts of bone growth into or in apposition to the porous coatings. In approximately one third of the components, no bone ingrowth or apposition was observed. No component had greater than 10% of the available porous material ingrown with bone. No relationship between the degree of bone ingrowth and the length of time in situ was noted. In all components, the majority of the porous coating contained fibrous tissue that in some cases displayed orientation indicating evidence of load transmission capability. The adherence of bony tissue at the time of removal, a positive roentgenographic evaluation, or a positive clinical presentation was not found to be a definite prognosticator of bone ingrowth. It appears that the combination of limited bone ingrowth and extensive fibrous tissue ingrowth is adequate for implant fixation.\r"

In patients with cirrhosis of the liver and in healthy control subjects, the rates of nitrogen flux, protein synthesis and protein breakdown were studied, using a single oral dose of 200 mg of [15N]glycine as a tracer. The nitrogen flux through the amino acid pool was measured separately with both urinary ammonia and urinary urea as end products; the average value was used for further calculations. 2. Subjects were studied in the fed state, both on an adequate and a protein-restricted diet, and also in the fasting state. 3. The rates of protein synthesis were markedly increased in the patients, not only in the fed but also in the fasting state. Protein breakdown rates were increased in the patients in the fed state. 4. The nitrogen balance in steady-state conditions in the fed state was more positive in the patients, while their nitrogen loss in the fasting state was no higher than that of control subjects. 5. A hypothesis is put forward that the high protein requirements of cirrhotic patients could be caused by small and inadequate liver glycogen stores; due to these small stores, gluconeogenesis from amino acids will take place and lead to an extra amino acid loss even during short-term fasting. This increased amino acid loss could explain the elevated protein requirements in cirrhotic patients.\r"

Similar increases in plasma bile acid and bilirubin concentrations were evident in bile duct ligated rats, indicating that the severity of cholestasis is almost identical in both models. 2. Plasma alkaline phosphodiesterase I was increased by only 50-80% while alkaline phosphatase was increased more than threefold after ANIT administration. This is in contrast to an earlier study [S. R. Simpson, K. Rahman & D. Billington (1984) Clinical Science 67, 647-652] where, after bile duct ligation, serum alkaline phosphodiesterase I was elevated sixfold before any increase in alkaline phosphatase activity became apparent. Thus, plasma alkaline phosphodiesterase I does not offer as sensitive a marker of intrahepatic cholestasis (induced by ANIT) as it does of extrahepatic cholestasis (induced by bile duct ligation). 3. Hepatic alkaline phosphodiesterase I was unaffected by ANIT pretreatment while hepatic alkaline phosphatase was increased up to seven times. It is suggested that raised plasma alkaline phosphodiesterase I is due to regurgitation of the biliary enzyme rather than overspill of the enzyme from liver into blood. 4. Gel filtration showed that 24 h and 96 h after ANIT administration, rat serum contained a high molecular weight form of alkaline phosphodiesterase I, suggesting a different isoenzyme profile.\r"

Acid loading with 1.5% (w/v) NH4Cl as the sole drinking fluid produced identical falls in blood pH, the difference remaining significant. 2. The ability of SHR to excrete acid and alkaline loads was compared with that of WKY under metabolic cage conditions. The effects of such manipulations on urinary sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate excretion were also determined. 3. No difference was found in the ability to excrete an acid load or to reduce urine pH. Neither total urinary ammonium ion nor titratable acid differed significantly between the strains under either baseline or acid-loading conditions. 4. Baseline urinary bicarbonate excretion was not significantly different between strains but intraperitoneal administration of NaHCO3 at 2.0 mmol/kg body weight resulted in enhanced excretion in the SHR (SHR vs WKY: 625.2 +/- 71.5 vs 381.8 +/- 40.6 mumol 24 h-1 kg-1 body weight, P less than 0.01, mean +/- SEM). 5. No difference in urinary sodium or potassium excretion was observed between SHR and WKY, but basal calcium and phosphate excretion were reduced in SHR (P less than 0.05). 6. Increased urinary bicarbonate excretion in the presence of significantly reduced plasma bicarbonate suggests reduced tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate, which may contribute to the mild metabolic acidosis in young SHR.\r"

The blood flow in the forearm and the calf of six healthy volunteers was measured at rest and after exercise by impedance plethysmography using pulsatile (QZp) and venous occlusion (QZocc) methods, and by venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography (Qsg). 2. At rest, the impedance QZp method gave values slightly higher than those of Qsg. In the forearm, the ratio QZp to Qsg was 1.26 in the supine position and 1.97 in the upright sitting position. For the calf muscle, the ratios were 1.08 in the supine position and 1.23 in the upright position. 3. Immediately after exercise, Qsg increased from resting values of approximately 2-4 ml min-1 100 ml-1 to mean values of 16-25 ml min-1 100 ml-1 in upright and supine arm or leg exercise. In contrast, the QZp values after exercise increased to only 3.1-4.6 ml min-1 100 ml-1. QZocc likewise failed to show increases in flow except in the supine leg exercise, where flow increased to 8.7 ml min-1 100 ml-1. 4. In an additional subject, it was shown that electrode position had no significant effect on the QZp blood flow measurement after exercise. 5. The failure of QZp to accurately follow the change in Qsg with exercise was probably due in part to pulsatile venous outflow. In addition, changes in microvessel packed cell volume and shear rate may influence the observed QZp. It is concluded that impedance plethysmography is not valid for estimation of limb blood flow during reactive hyperaemia after exercise.\r"

In 22 patients meeting criteria for the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the mean transferrin accumulation rate was threefold greater (P less than 0.005) than in 22 patients not meeting these criteria, although most possessed an appropriate risk factor for ARDS, in addition to extensive radiographic changes. 3. The double-isotope method did not completely separate patients with ARDS from those not meeting the criteria or from control subjects and cannot be considered a diagnostic test for the condition. Statistically significant rates of transferrin accumulation, however, occurred more frequently in patients with ARDS (82%) than in controls (64%) or in those without ARDS (59%).\r"

Non-specific N-methyltransferase activity was estimated in 17 of the surgical specimens using beta-phenylethylamine as substrate. This activity was 38.9% (SEM 5.3) of that with phenylethanolamine. Comparative studies with rabbit lung, which has a well-characterized non-specific N-methyltransferase, showed significant differences in substrate specificity between the two species. 3.

Incubation of ALP with stimulated human PMN's resulted in a rapid loss of anti-elastase activity which paralleled that of the antitrypsin activity, suggesting that both inhibitor activities are represented by the same active site. 3. The myeloperoxidase-oxidizing system was found to be responsible for the inactivation of ALP. 4. The oxidized inhibitor was unable to form stable complexes with PMN elastase but was resistant to breakdown by proteolytic enzymes from stimulated PMN's. 5. It was observed that stimulated cells are capable of releasing elastase which shows full activity in the presence of a large molar excess of ALP. 6. We conclude from this study that stimulated PMN's are able to inactivate ALP by which released elastase is able to express enzymatic activity in spite of the presence of this low-molecular-weight inhibitor. Thus, inactivation of ALP by triggered PMN's may contribute to destructive processes in which elastase is thought to be a mediator.\r"

The diet during the study consisted of a mainly carbohydrate breakfast, consumed immediately before each day's exercise, and unrestricted access to a normal mixed diet after completion of each day's exercise. Water was allowed ad libitum during the walk. Food and fluid intake were recorded. 3. Body weight remained constant over the 4-day walk. The difference between total daily fluid intake and the corresponding 24 h urine output was 1684 (250) ml, 1621 (522) ml, 1107 (252) ml and 1406 (208) ml, respectively, on each of the 4 exercise days. 4. There was a calculated increase of 21.3(6.6)% in plasma volume over the 4-day walk; the largest daily change [11.3(2.9)%] occurred during the walk on day 1. The increase in plasma volume was maintained for at least 4 days after completion of the walk. 5. From day 2, serum sodium concentration tended to increase during the exercise period and fell to the pre-exercise concentration during the overnight rest periods. The concentration of the other measured serum constituents remained relatively constant, and serum osmolality did not alter over the study period.\r"

These changes were accompanied by large increases in plasma adrenaline and smaller increases in plasma noradrenaline. 2. These effects of morphine were prevented by intravenous naloxone, demonstrating their dependence on stimulation of opiate receptors. 3. Pretreatment with the antihistamines cimetidine and chlorpheniramine enhanced the morphine-induced rise in blood pressure, excluding a role for histamine release in the hypertensive action of morphine. 4. The centrally acting alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine prevented the morphine-induced hypertension and rise in plasma catecholamines, suggesting that these effects are exerted via central pathways. Clonidine alone reduced blood pressure and heart rate and produced hyperglycaemia. 5. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine reduced the increase in blood pressure after morphine, although the increase in plasma catecholamines was augmented. 6. Pentobarbitone anaesthesia prevented the morphine-induced cardiovascular changes, the increase in plasma catecholamines and the hyperglycaemia. 7. These findings indicate, that in conscious rabbits, morphine induces hypertension by stimulation of opiate receptors leading to increased sympatho-adrenal activity. The hyperglycaemia appears to be in response to secretion of adrenaline. These effects probably result from a central action of morphine.\r"

No significant difference was observed in rates of muscle protein synthesis between the two sides of the spine, at the levels of the first vertebrae in neutral alignment at the top and bottom of the curve. However, in every patient, at the apex of the spinal curve, synthesis was higher on the convexity than on the concavity (0.077 +/- 0.04 %/h convex, 0.052 +/- 0.02 %/h concave, mean +/- SD, P less than 0.01). 3. Muscle RNA activity (microgram of protein synthesized h-1 microgram-1 of RNA) was lower at the curve apices on the concave than the convex side (0.019 +/- 0.09 microgram h-1 microgram-1 convex apex, 0.016 +/- 0.06 microgram h-1 microgram-1 concave apex, P less than 0.05).

The results are consistent with effects on muscle protein turnover secondary to an increased muscle contractile activity on the curve convexity and functional immobilization of the muscle on the curve concavity.\r"

It is concluded that glucocorticoid administration decreases the rate of glucose utilization but increases that of glutamine (both in vivo and in vitro) by the epithelial cells of the small intestine.

Faecal sodium output was significantly higher in SHR compared with WKY in both young (+67%) and adult (+43%) rats. 3. Small-intestinal sodium absorption was equal in young SHR and WKY, but significantly greater net sodium absorption was found in the ileum of adult SHR. In contrast, net sodium absorption was reduced from the colon of both young and adult SHR. 4. In adult SHR, the colonic transepithelial short-circuit current (Isc) and the transepithelial potential difference (PD) were significantly higher, whereas the transepithelial membrane resistance (Rm) was significantly lower than in WKY. There was an identical drop in Isc in both strains when luminal sodium was replaced by choline. These data cannot be explained by increased electrogenic cation (sodium) absorption in the SHR, but would favour chloride secretion. 5. It is suggested that in SHR membrane electrolyte transport abnormalities may also be present in the epithelial cells of the small and large intestine, as have been demonstrated already in blood cells by several investigators. The SHR may become an interesting experimental animal model for the study of generalized ion transport disorders.\r"

Serum apolipoprotein (apo) B levels rose by 8%, HDL-cholesterol decreased by 10% and HDL-TG increased by 57% at 6-8 h. 3. When ethanol was omitted, serum cholesterol and TG rose by 6% and 70%, respectively; both apo AI and apo B levels went up by 8%, whereas HDL-cholesterol rose progressively (15%) at 12 h. 4. The flotation rates of both HDL2 and HDL3 increased, reaching a maximum 6-8 h after ethanol plus fat intake. These changes were due to an increase in TG and phospholipid contents, whereas cholesteryl esters and proteins decreased. 5. The alterations in HDL are attributable to the increase in TG-rich lipoproteins, to the stimulated cholesterol esterification (+15%) and to an enhanced transfer of newly formed cholesteryl esters to apo-B-containing lipoproteins in exchange for TG. 6. Changes in HDL properties were evident only when ethanol was given concomitantly with fat. 7. These findings suggest that in the postprandial phase lipoprotein changes may occur, which facilitate an improved removal of cholesterol from tissues.\r"

Acute metabolic effects of sodium fluoride therapy were analysed among 41 osteoporotic patients already receiving large calcium supplements, 33 of whom underwent simultaneous metabolic balance studies. 2. Mean serum calcium fell transiently within 24-48 h by 0.03 +/- 0.07 (SD) mmol/l (P less than 0.01) and phosphorus by 0.06 +/- 0.08 (SD) mmol/l (P less than 0.001). In a subgroup, ionized calcium fell and biologically active parathyroid hormone (bio-PTH) rose more than fivefold (P less than 0.01). Urine calcium rose after an insignificant fall. 3. Pretreatment calcium and phosphorus balances were significantly positive and did not change overall during the first 8 days of treatment. However, on analysing balances in two groups relative to serum changes, in patients whose serum levels changed least sodium fluoride increased faecal calcium (P less than 0.025) and phosphorus (P less than 0.01) and reduced calcium balance (P less than 0.01), giving a mean balance difference between the two groups of 2.1 mmol daily (P less than 0.001). 4. Very small changes in serum levels therefore indicate well-marked metabolic responses: sodium fluoride acutely stimulates bio-PTH activity and must also enhance mineral uptake from circulation into tissue(s). By separate and opposing action(s) it inhibits intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption, predominantly in those whose serum levels remain stable. All these effects may be relevant to long-term therapeutic results.\r"

Sodium ion (Na+) transport, a principal function of the gallbladder epithelium, was studied by measuring the flux of 22Na across isolated, inflamed human gallbladder mucosa maintained in a modified 'Ussing' flux chamber. Tissue was obtained from cholecystectomy specimens in symptomatic patients with cholelithiasis. 2. In 30 gallbladders studied, 57% had a net Na+ flux from mucosa to serosa (Na+ absorption), while 23% had a net Na+ flux from serosa to mucosa (Na+ secretion). The remaining 20% showed no overall net Na+ flux. 3. Indomethacin added to the serosal fluid reversed the direction of net Na+ flux in secreting gallbladders and caused an absorption of Na+. In Na+-absorbing gallbladders, indomethacin caused a slight reduction in Na+ absorption. No change in Na+ flux was induced in gallbladders with no initial net Na+ flux. 4. These results demonstrate that instead of absorbing Na+, some inflamed human gallbladders may secrete Na+. As this secretion can be reversed to the more usual absorption by indomethacin, it is likely that this secretion is mediated by prostaglandins.\r"

The maximal prolongation of the pulse interval, determined during held expiration, occurred within 2-3 s from the onset of the neck suction. All the measured variables were in steady states between 2 and 3 min from the start of neck suction. 3. Neck suction at -10 mmHg resulted only in an immediate change in pulse interval. All variables changed approximately linearly with the magnitude of the neck suction between -10 and -40 mmHg. 4. The reproducibilities of the responses to neck suction at -30 mmHg, expressed as two standard deviations of the differences between responses on two occasions, were (mean responses in parentheses): immediate pulse interval, +/- 32 (+236) ms; steady-state heart rate, +/- 2.5 (-6.5) beats/min; cardiac output +/- 0.14 (-0.59) l/min; systolic and diastolic blood pressures, +/- 10.0 (-16.9) and +/- 5.4 (-10.1) mmHg, respectively. 5. Control values and responses to neck suction at -30 mmHg were compared in subjects grouped in four age bands between 19 and 80 years. With increasing age, the control value of cardiac index (cardiac output divided by calculated body surface area) decreased, systolic and diastolic pressures increased, and the responses of all the measured variables to neck suction decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant activity was detected in muscle biopsy samples or washed erythrocytes. 2. Serum carnosinase activity was significantly lower in chronic alcoholic patients compared with a group of age-matched controls. Alcoholics with abnormal muscle biopsies had significantly lower enzyme activities than either those patients with normal muscle biopsies or the controls. Serum enzyme activities in patients with normal muscle biopsies were not significantly different from controls. 3. Serum carnosinase activity was inversely correlated with the degree of muscle atrophy as measured by the type II fibre atrophy factor. There was a positive correlation between the enzyme activity and skeletal muscle mass as reflected by the creatinine-height index. Furthermore, the enzyme activity significantly increased, with resolution or improvement in the myopathy, in patients who abstained from alcohol. 4. Kinetic studies showed that the reduced carnosinase activity was due mainly to a decrease in the apparent Vmax. The apparent Km was significantly higher in the myopathic compared with non-myopathic alcoholics. Mixing serum from controls and patients with myopathy gave the expected values, indicating the absence of a serum enzyme inhibitory factor. Acute alcohol loading had no effect on the serum carnosinase activity. 5. The decrease in serum carnosinase activity in alcoholics was not related to the severity of their liver disease. Assays of serum carnosinase in chronic alcoholics, can thus be used as a marker of their associated myopathy.\r"

Using a previously established method of isolating an active-sodium-transport inhibitor (ASTI) from hypothalamic cell culture medium, the inhibitor was isolated and partially purified from sequential passages through Sephadex G-25 and h.p.l.c., and its effects on de-endothelialized rabbit aortic strips were investigated. 2. ASTI caused a cumulative concentration-dependent increase in tension which reversed slowly after wash, and the wash showed an identical effect on fresh strips. 3. Ouabain, used as a control, also caused a concentration-dependent increase in tension which reached a plateau at a concentration of 10 mmol/l. Both ouabain and ASTI caused a significant potentiation of the vasoconstrictor effect of noradrenaline at concentrations of 1 nmol/l-0.1 mmol/l. 4. Both ASTI and ouabain caused a significantly greater (P less than 0.01) calcium retention than control medium in aortic strips. 5. Incubation of ASTI with prolidase, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase A destroyed the vasoconstrictor effects as well as its inhibitory effects on sodium, potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and sodium efflux from erythrocytes, but leucine aminopeptidase was ineffective. 6. These studies suggest that hypothalamic cells in culture release a peptidic inhibitor of active sodium transport which increases vascular reactivity, potentiates vasoconstrictor effects of noradrenaline and causes calcium retention.\r"

In comparison with normal subjects, the patients showed hypomagnesaemia (mean 0.54 mmol/l), which was associated with a normal urinary magnesium excretion (mean 4.83 mmol/24 h). Urinary calcium excretion was significantly lower in the patients than in the normal subjects (mean 2.05 vs 5.15 mmol/24 h, respectively; P less than 0.01), despite slightly higher total serum calcium levels (2.53 vs 2.38 mmol/l, respectively; P less than 0.05). During magnesium chloride infusion, when serum magnesium levels were comparable in patients and controls, urinary calcium excretion remained lower in the patients, indicating that hypomagnesaemia was not the cause of the hypocalciuria. 3. Dietary magnesium supplementation resulted in a significant increase in the serum magnesium levels in the patients, while dietary magnesium deprivation resulted in a comparable decrease in urinary magnesium excretion in patients and controls (to 1.46 and 2.00 mmol/day, respectively), although the serum magnesium level fell further (to 0.46 mmol/l) in the patients. 4. The dissociation of renal calcium and magnesium excretion appears to be part of the intrinsic tubular defect caused by cis-platinum. This dissociation of urinary calcium and magnesium excretion, which resembles that seen in Bartter's syndrome, may result from a lesion in the distal convoluted tubule.\r"

The relative contribution of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system to the regulation of the chronotropic response to dynamic exercise was evaluated indirectly in nine patients with thyrotoxicosis and in seven normal volunteers. All subjects were women, with equivalent ages in both groups. Six of the nine patients with hyperthyroidism were reevaluated after clinical compensation of the disease with propylthiouracil. 2. Heart rate responses were evaluated during discontinuous dynamic effort maintained for 4 min on a bicycle ergometer at levels of 5, 15, 25 and 50 W, and also of 75 W in normal individuals. The study was also performed under conditions of sympathetic pharmacological blockade with propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight). 3. Even though the magnitude of the total increase in heart rate evoked by each level of dynamic exercise was equivalent in normal and hyperthyroid patients, the tachycardiac response occurring at the beginning of the exercise, which depends on a predominantly vagal mechanism, was substantially different from that observed after 30 s of effort, when sympathetic contribution becomes more important. The hyperthyroid patients showed considerably lower increases in heart rate than the normal individuals during the initial 30 s of effort, with the opposite occurring from this moment onward. 4. In the hyperthyroid patients, beta-adrenergic blockage depressed tachycardia after 30 s of effort at the 15 and 50 W levels, whereas in normal individuals this effect was only manifested at 50 and 75 W. 5. The patients who obtained clinical compensation showed a pattern of chronotropic response which tended to be close to that shown by normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve patients with chronic bronchitis and airflow obstruction but little emphysema and 13 with predominantly emphysema and airflow obstruction but little bronchitis were selected based on history, chest roentgenogram, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dsb). Emphysema patients had less cough, less sputum, less chronic bronchitis, lower Dsb, and more radiographic evidence of vascular deficiency. There was no difference in anthropometric features, smoking history, atopic skin sensitivity, hemoglobin, blood eosinophilia, PaO2, PaCO2, ECG, lung volumes, or expiratory flow rates. The two groups had similar airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine; the geometric mean provocation concentrations producing a 20 percent FEV1 fall (PC20) was 0.56 mg/ml for the bronchitis patients and 0.28 mg/ml for the emphysema patients (p greater than 0.20). Regression of log histamine PC20 vs percent predicted FEV1 showed a high correlation in both groups (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01 in bronchitis and r = 0.79, p less than 0.001 in emphysema). The regression lines were almost identical. These data suggest that in COAD bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine is mainly due to the altered airway geometry, and that there is no difference in histamine responsiveness between patients with emphysematous COAD and nonemphysematous COAD with chronic bronchitis.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a persistent increase in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness following acute exposure to strong respiratory irritants in four subjects with no past history of asthma or atopy and in a subject with mild asthma. They were exposed either to a bleaching agent, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, perchloroethylene, or toluene diisocyanate fumes. In all cases the inhalation of high concentrations of irritant fumes was brief (less than one hour) and induced acute symptoms of cough and dyspnea. The asthmatic subject developed a severe bronchospasm which required mechanical ventilation. In all subjects the exposure led to prolonged (more than one year) symptoms of variable airflow obstruction induced on contact with common respiratory irritants. In the previously normal subjects, a mild hyperresponsiveness to methacholine could be observed. The asthmatic subject became dependent on steroids. No change in the forced expiratory volume in one second was observed when the subject exposed to sulfuric acid was rechallenged in the laboratory, but her nonspecific bronchial responsiveness was then back to normal at this time. When those exposed to perchloroethylene or toluene diisocyanate fumes were reexposed to these agents, a late asthmatic response occurred, suggesting that the subjects developed occupational asthma after an intense short-term exposure to perchloroethylene or toluene diisocyanate. We conclude that airway hyperresponsiveness can develop or increase after the inhalation of high concentrations of irritants and that these changes may be prolonged. Occupational asthma following intense short-term exposure to sensitizing agents should be differentiated from airway hyperresponsiveness which results from a nonsensitizing mechanism, as in the reactive airway dysfunction syndrome.\r"

Worker and control subjects who smoked had smoking histories of less than 27 pack-years, a level of smoking lower than that previously determined to adversely affect NK function. Asbestos workers who did not smoke had percentages and total numbers of NK cells and NK function not different from that of nonsmoker control subjects. Workers who smoked and had evidence of asbestosis (ILO profusion category greater than or equal to 1/0) had significantly lower total numbers of NK cells and mononuclear cell NK activity than did smoker control subjects or smokers with pleural plaques only (p less than or equal to 0.05). Numbers of NK cells and NK cell function were not decreased in either of the asbestos-exposed smoking groups without asbestosis when compared to nonsmoker controls. We conclude that smoking and asbestos exposure interact to decrease mononuclear cell NK function in workers with levels of asbestos exposure sufficient to induce asbestosis. This finding may explain in part the previously reported synergistic effect of smoking and asbestos exposure on the risk of lung cancer. Furthermore, the data presented here clarify previous conflicting reports on NK function where asbestos exposed groups have not been stratified for analysis of data.\r"

  ".W": "This study supports the theory that asbestos exposure may be implicated in a recent upsurge of terminal lung cancer cases in Kure, Japan. The number of asbestos bodies found in the lung during autopsy of 158 subjects from 1984 to 1986 suggests that 70.4 percent of the 51 diagnosed lung cancer cases could be attributed to asbestos exposure. Of the 107 subjects in whom death was not caused by cancer, 38.4 percent had significant asbestos exposure. Types of asbestos bodies found in diagnosed lung cancer cases were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray analyzer. Chrysotile was the most widely found component, but amphiboles such as crocidolite and amosite also were detected. Residents of Kure had high exposure to the inhalation of asbestos bodies, possibly related to the upsurge in lung cancer deaths. In our earlier report, asbestos exposure was implicated in the increased incidence of malignant mesothelioma in Kure, an active Japanese ship-building port since the 1920s. Our current findings indicate that asbestos exposure may be a pathogenic factor in lung cancer in world seaports where asbestos exposure has been prevalent.\r"

We also compared the variability of the pressures obtained after distal (mechanical) and proximal (balloon inflation) wedging of a catheter in three to six different sites in each patient. When the wedge pressure measurements were repeated in the same site (n = 7), the mean of the absolute differences was below 1 mm Hg. In individual patients, the maximal pressure difference between sites ranged from 0 to 6 mm Hg for Ppw and from 1 to 12 mm Hg for Pdw. The range in Pdw increased from normal to abnormal angiograms. These results suggest that when Pdw is high in one region, it may correspond to local perfusion abnormalities. When the wedge pressure is measured repeatedly or under different conditions, it should be determined after wedging the catheter in the same location for all of the periods of observation.\r"

The 24-hour Holter recordings were performed during continuous intravenous infusions of aminophylline (0.56 +/- 0.20 mg/kg/h) and terbutaline (0.034 +/- 0.014 microgram/kg/min). Serum theophylline concentration was 12.1 +/- 3.8 micrograms/ml and never reached the toxic level (greater than 20 micrograms/ml). Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were absent in 35 percent of patients and 48 percent had rare unifocal PVCs (less than 10/h). Only 17 percent of patients (five of 29) exhibited severe ventricular arrhythmias: PVCs greater than 10/h (n = 3), multifocal PVCs (n = 1); and a short run of ventricular tachycardia (n = 1). Serious supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in only 7 percent of patients (two of 29) who developed sustained runs of atrial tachycardia. These arrhythmias were always clinically well tolerated and spontaneously resolved without any antiarrhythmic treatment. We conclude that severe arrhythmias are rarely observed during combined therapy with aminophylline and terbutaline in status asthmaticus.\r"

Group 1 (n = 69) consisted of patients with nonhypotensive sepsis without coronary artery disease. Group 2 (n = 25) comprised septic patients who had clinical evidence of coronary artery disease. All patients were hemodynamically stable and normotensive at the time of the study. None required inotropic support. While the two groups had similar mean heart rates, mean blood pressures, and biventricular filling pressures, the mean cardiac index was significantly lower in group 2 (3.5 +/- 0.9 L/min/m2 vs 4.4 +/- 1.2; p less than 0.05). This lower cardiac index was related to significantly lower end-diastolic volume indices in group #2, not to differences in contractility between groups. Since the ventricular filling pressures of the groups were similar, the differences in end-diastolic volumes indicate differences in the biventricular compliance. In the presence of hyperdynamic, nonhypotensive sepsis, coronary artery disease was associated with a clinically significant impairment of biventricular compliance, which resulted in a reduction in cardiac output and systemic oxygen transport.\r"

All patients were interviewed and examined and performed inspiratory and expiratory maximal flow-volume curves more than six months after the onset of ARDS. Three women had developed symptomatic upper airway obstruction due to laryngotracheal stenosis 4 to 12 months after discharge from the hospital. Potential etiologic factors included difficult orotracheal intubation (one) and high tracheal cuff pressures (one). The three survivors who developed laryngotracheal stenoses did not differ from the 27 survivors of ARDS without symptomatic upper airway obstruction with respect to age, duration of tracheal intubation, or maximum level of positive end-expiratory pressure. Each patient with upper airway obstruction required more than one operation for laryngotracheal reconstruction. Although corrective surgery improved airflow, two survivors of ARDS had upper airway obstruction and exertional dyspnea more than five years after the ARDS. We conclude that upper airway obstruction is an important cause of dyspnea and impairment following ARDS. Exertional dyspnea weeks to months following treatment for ARDS suggests the possibility of laryngotracheal stenosis.\r"

A control group was comprised of 35 patients who were referred with symptoms suggestive of SAS but had negative sleep studies. Follow-up was obtained by survey questionnaire. Nine of 91 SAS and four of 35 control patients had died by completion of the study. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between the two groups. None of the SAS patients died in their sleep, but they reported a higher incidence of disability and vehicular mishaps than did control subjects. The findings in this study do not support the hypothesis that SAS patients are at increased risk of dying in their sleep.\r"

The subjects were divided into four subsets based on chest roentgenogram and CT scan of the thorax: group 1 consisted of 21 subjects with category 0 chest roentgenogram and category 0 CT scan; group 2, 28 subjects with category E 1 on both chest roentgenogram and CT scan; group 3, 18 subjects with category E 1 on chest roentgenogram but with coalescence or conglomeration or both seen only on CT scan; and group 4, 27 subjects with category E 1 and coalescence or conglomeration or both on roentgenogram and CT scan. The groups did not differ in terms of age, height, cigarette smoking, or years of exposure. Lung volumes were significantly reduced only in group 4 (p less than 0.05). Lung compliance, diffusion capacity, and the rest-exercise P(A-a)O2 gradient were reduced in groups 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05). Expiratory flow rates were significantly reduced in groups 2, 3, and 4, with the lowest values in group 4. The expiratory flow rates in group 3 were significantly lower in group 3 than in group 2. These results support the concept that airflow in silica-exposed workers is significantly reduced when the disease is detectable on simple chest roentgenogram; coalescence or conglomeration or both on chest roentgenogram or CT scan is associated with significant loss of lung volumes, gas exchange function, and increased airflow obstruction.\r"

The following 12 individually significant risk factors were identified by univariate analysis: preoperative factors: history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), history of prior sternotomy, pyuria, low ejection fraction, and high left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; intraoperative factors: valvular or aortic aneurysm surgery, prolonged bypass pump time, repeat placement on bypass, duration of surgery; and postoperative factors: surgical reexploration due to postoperative hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the immediate postoperative period, prolonged time (greater than 48 hours) on mechanical ventilation. By logistic regression analysis, three of these factors were found to be associated independently with increased odds of developing mediastinitis: duration of surgery, history of COPD, and prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation.\r"

Complication rates with regard to pneumothorax, fever, and hemorrhage were compared, as were yield data for neoplasm, sarcoidosis, and other miscellaneous pulmonary diagnoses. Complication rates were low in both groups and not statistically different; yield data were likewise comparable, particularly in diffuse neoplasm and sarcoidosis. This report suggests that TBB without fluoroscopy (in the basilar segments) is safe and that diagnostic yield, particularly in sarcoidosis and diffuse neoplasm, is good.\r"

The new type 2B needle was compared with either the original fixed type 1A or the retractable type 2A needle in 20 patients at 34 transbronchial sites and found a similar diagnostic yield.

We identified ten patients with pulmonary functional evidence of restriction among 158 patients with cystic fibrosis followed at the University of California San Diego Medical Center in 1984 and 1985. We characterized the radiographic, pulmonary functional, and clinical characteristics of these restricted patients compared to matched nonrestricted patients. Pulmonary volumes were measured by three different techniques: plethysmography; nitrogen washout; and radiography. Except for plethysmographic pulmonary volumes, there were no significant differences between the matched restricted and nonrestricted patients. Radiographic pulmonary volume tended to overestimate gas volume measured by the other techniques. Differences among these techniques (thought to represent air-space filling) correlated best with radiographic evidence of air trapping and bronchial markings and not with parenchymal lesions. Serial pulmonary function tests demonstrated changes in pulmonary volume in several patients and a trend toward improvement in pulmonary volume in the restricted patients over time. We conclude that restricted pulmonary function does not necessarily indicate more severe disease in patients with cystic fibrosis and may be reversible in some. The mechanism of restriction may be related more to radiographic evidence of airway disease than to parenchymal abnormalities.\r"

Treatment-related complications, however, are considerable, and a common problem encountered is respiratory distress or respiratory insufficiency. Usually these difficulties have been attributed to infectious etiologies or to chemotherapy-induced interstitial fibrosis, most often involving bleomycin. We describe five patients presenting with respiratory problems several weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy. These patients, who represent 3 percent of all patients treated with a single bleomycin-containing regimen for intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, were all initially thought to have chemotherapy-induced interstitial fibrosis but were found on subsequent evaluation to have pulmonary emboli. Of the three patients in whom pulmonary emboli were diagnosed antemortem, two had symptoms suggestive of pulmonary emboli and all were successfully treated and remained well and free of lymphoma for over 24 months. Two additional patients were diagnosed at autopsy. We suggest that pulmonary emboli may contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and recommend that patients presenting with respiratory difficulties be evaluated for pulmonary emboli.\r"

Our experience demonstrates the value and safety of using cautery wire snares to diagnose and treat endobronchial lesions.\r"

Large posterior mediastinal goiters, contralateral retrotracheal or retroesophageal posterior mediastinal goiters, and isolated mediastinal goiters with no significant cervical connection are best removed through a combined cervical and thoracic approach. The Lahey Clinic experience with three patients with posterior mediastinal goiter is described.\r"

A total of 119 patients were categorized based upon their ultimate diagnosis as having malignant (n = 41), granulomatous (n = 25), or nonspecific pleuritis (n = 53). Weight loss, fever greater than 38 degrees, a positive PPD, a pleural fluid lymphocytosis of greater than 95 percent, and an effusion which occupied more than half a hemithorax were significantly more common in the patients with malignant or granulomatous disease. Based on these results, a conservative approach is recommended for the patient with an initial biopsy which reveals only nonspecific pleuritis who has none of the criteria, but an aggressive diagnostic work-up in the individual with two or more criteria is advocated.\r"

  ".W": "HLA-DR4 and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sjogren's syndrome) are associated with abnormal pulmonary function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Since recent investigations have found that much of the genomic polymorphism of the HLA-DR4 haplotype comes from the closely linked DQw allele, we reanalyzed this set of data to evaluate the relationship between the DQw allotypes and pulmonary function in rheumatoid arthritis. Using a step-wise regression analysis, we found that the presence of DQw1 was a stronger predictor of an abnormal forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (D) than the presence of DR4, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, smoking status, or any other clinical parameter. DQw1-positive patients had a mean (+/- SD) percent of predicted FEV1, FVC, and D of 84.2 (+/- 19.8), 88.0 (+/- 17.9) and 85.6 (+/- 20.9) percent, respectively, all significantly lower than DQw-1 negative patients (p = 0.02, 0.02, and 0.03). Smokers with the heterozygous phenotype, DQw1/DQw3, tended to have obstructive disease of the airways, with a mean (+/- SD) FEV1 of 80.1 +/- 24.4 percent of predicted, compared to 95.7 +/- 12.1 percent of predicted in DQw1/DQw3-negative individuals (p = 0.03). Patients who had a DQw2 allele were more likely to have normal pulmonary function. We conclude that the HLA-DQw1 allotype is a strong predictor of abnormal pulmonary function and that it may identify smoking subjects with rheumatoid arthritis subjects who are prone to develop obstruction of airflow.\r"

In 159 of these 169 patients (94.1%), the endoscopic findings suggested cancer, while in the remaining 10 patients (5.9%) the endoscopic appearance suggested benign ulcer. In six of these 10 patients, the initial endoscopic biopsies did not reveal cancer and correct diagnosis was delayed for as long as 14 months. Three of the 10 patients had \"early gastric cancer\" by pathologic criteria at gastrectomy, although one had lymph node metastasis. The other seven patients had pathologic criteria for advanced gastric cancer, and three had lymph node metastasis. In spite of advanced cancer and/or lymph node metastasis in eight of our 10 patients, five-year survival in these patients with benign-appearing ulcers was 70%, as compared to 17% in patients whose gastric lesions appeared malignant at endoscopy.\r"

Male golden hamsters received either hydrocortisone sodium succinate or saline intraperitoneally for three days. In the first experiment, hamsters were sacrificed 1 hr after injection of tritiated thymidine [( 3H]TdR) to label proliferating cells. In the second experiment, hamsters were sacrificed hourly after a single [3H]TdR injection up to 48 hr in order to determine cell cycle time by the method of fraction of labeled mitoses. In the third experiment, hamsters were sacrificed 1, 24, and 72 hr after [3H]TdR injection for the study of epithelial migration and cell turnover time. Sections of fundic and antral mucosae were prepared for light autoradiography. Steroid treatment caused no gross or microscopic injury to gastric mucosa, but the number of [3H]TdR-labeled cells as well as the thickness of the proliferative zone were reduced significantly in fundic mucosa, but not in antral mucosa. The study of the fraction labeled mitoses indicated that steroid treatment lengthened the cell cycle time in fundic mucosa, which was due primarily to prolonged G1 and DNA synthesis phases. Furthermore, epithelial migration was significantly slower in fundic mucosa after steroid treatment, which was associated with a prolonged cell turnover time. Thus, parenteral steroids depress the entire process of epithelial renewal in hamster fundic mucosa.\r"

Gastric juice viscosity in active and healing gastric ulcer patients was significantly lower than that in the scarring stage or hospital control patients (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). In duodenal ulcer patients, a significant difference was found between the active and healing stages and hospital controls (P less than 0.01). However, the difference between the active and healing stages and the scarring stage was not significant. Gastric juice viscosity is a simple, reliable, clinically useful measure.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian pattern of intragastric acidity was assessed in 19 healthy subjects and 37 patients with active, endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer using 24-hr continuous intraluminal pH-metry. The median pH 24-hr profiles showed that ulcer patients had lower postprandial pH elevations and a smaller decline in acidity during the early morning hours when compared with controls. The after-lunch and -dinner area under the curve and maximum pH values were significantly higher in controls compared to ulcer patients. In the nighttime, the median pH values in controls were significantly higher during 9 PM to 12 PM (P = 0.02), 12 PM to 4 AM (P = 0.01), and 4 AM to 8 AM (P = 0.0008) compared to the ulcer patients. We conclude that the 24-hr acidity is higher in ulcer patients compared to healthy subjects and that the differences are particularly evident in the postprandial and nocturnal periods.\r"

  ".W": "The healing process of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer was studied by [3H]thymidine autoradiography. After the development of ulcer in the duodenum, cell proliferation was markedly activated not only in the crypts but also in the Brunner's glands near the ulcer. In the initial stages of ulcer healing, they both contributed to form the surface covering regenerating epithelium. Granulation tissue also proliferated at the base of the ulcer. In later stages of ulcer healing, new crypts were formed in the floor of the ulcer. New villi regenerated from these crypts and Brunner's glands regenerated by proliferation in situ. The ulcer base then was completely covered with new villi and granulation tissue was replaced by dense fibrous connective tissue. The present study suggested that the Brunner's glands, together with the crypts of Lieberkuhn, play an important role in the healing process of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer.\r"

With 22.5 mg elementary zinc, the increase in plasma zinc was significantly lower in the cirrhotic patients than in the control group with P less than 0.01 in the first and second hours and P less than 0.05 in the fourth hour. The zinc malabsorption may result from an abnormal small intestinal mucosa. Indeed small intestinal biopsies in all patients showed partial shortening and prominent distension of villi and intense stromal edema with inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria. However, it is not clear whether these intestinal changes are due to zinc deficiency or to portal hypertension. Thus zinc malabsorption appears to contribute to zinc deficiency in nonalcoholic cirrhotics and seems to result, in part, from pathological changes in the mucosa.\r"

However, its splanchnic hemodynamic effects have not been investigated thoroughly. In 11 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics were evaluated before and 20-40 min after intravenous administration of 2 mg triglycyl-lysin-vasopressin. Following the drug administration, heart rate decreased by 10% and cardiac index by 22% on the average, respectively; mean arterial pressure increased by 14% and systemic vascular resistence index by 48%. Hepatic venous pressure gradient showed a marked and persistent fall, averaging 31%. Hepatic and splenic blood flow decreased by 31% and 56%, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient and in splenic blood flow. By contrast, the decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient was not significantly correlated to the decrease in hepatic blood flow or in cardiac index. We conclude that in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, triglycyl-lysin-vasopressin decreases portal pressure as well as hepatic and splenic blood flows. The decrease in portal pressure was due to the decrease in splanchnic blood inflow and not to the decrease in cardiac index.\r"

In the present study, the intestinal phase of the enterohepatic circulation of two bile acid glucuronides was examined. [3 beta-3H]cholic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucuronide or [3 beta-3H]lithocholic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucuronide was perfused through isolated segments of ileum or jejunum with intact blood supply in rats prepared with a biliary fistula. [14C]Taurocholic acid was perfused simultaneously with each glucuronide to compare glucuronide absorption with that of an actively transported bile acid. Intestinal absorption was determined by measuring the rate of secretion of labeled bile acid in bile. The absorption of [3H]cholic acid glucuronide by the ileum and jejunum was one fortieth and one eighth, respectively, that of [14C]taurocholic acid. Comparison of the two glucuronides show that [3H]lithocholic acid glucuronide absorption was 18 and 10 times greater than [3H]cholic acid glucuronide absorption from the jejunum and ileum, respectively. Collectively, the above observations suggest that glucuronidation of bile acids markedly reduces absorption from the small intestine.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of the present study were to evaluate the accuracy of 24-hr intraesophageal pH monitoring in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in the hospital setting and to establish whether there were any differences in terms of reflux events between patients with and without endoscopic esophagitis. Fifteen control subjects and 47 patients with proven gastroesophageal reflux disease were studied. A composite score of reflux events (number of reflux episodes; total, upright, and supine reflux time; number of refluxes lasting more than 5 min; and duration of the longest reflux) provided the best discrimination between controls and patients (94% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Patients with esophagitis showed concurrently a longer total reflux time and supine reflux time, and more prolonged reflux episodes than those without esophagitis. On the other hand the severity of esophagitis was directly related to the duration of both total and supine reflux. The results indicate that inpatient 24-hr pH-metry is very accurate in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. They also suggest that prolonged esophageal exposure to acid, particularly at night, and slow esophageal acid clearing are factors that determine the appearance and/or perpetuation of esophagitis in patients with reflux.\r"

Prominent among these are infections of the gastrointestinal tract. However, studies of large numbers of patients documenting the frequency of such involvement are lacking. We reviewed the records of 100 patients with AIDS and assessed the frequency and organisms causing infectious diarrhea. We found diarrhea to be more common in homosexuals (80%) than heterosexuals with a risk factor of parenteral drug use (58%). In one third of all cases, no infectious etiology was found. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) was the most commonly identified cause of infectious diarrhea in our series, followed by cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidium, Salmonella spp., and herpes virus. In addition, bacteremia was documented in 43% of patients with infectious diarrhea and was most commonly due to MAI. Finally, we demonstrated that multiple concurrent infections are not uncommon (22%) in AIDS patients and that the diarrheal syndrome may not respond unless all pathogens are eradicated.\r"

Although the immunosuppressive treatment with cortisone itself resulted in a deleterious effect on brush border membrane enzymes, the decline in disaccharidases (sucrase, maltase, and lactase) and alkaline phosphatase was highly significant (P less than 0.001) following G. lamblia infection. The alterations in enzymatic activity in immune intact but infected animals demonstrated the potential of the parasite itself to cause damage to the brush border membrane. We believe that individuals with underlying immunodeficiency, upon infection with G. lamblia, may have increased damage of the brush border membrane, leading to severe malabsorption.\r"
