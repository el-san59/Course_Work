  ".W": "Thirteen dogs in whom at least one morphologically distinct sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) could be reproducibly initiated by programmed cardiac stimulation 18 +/- 3 days following experimental myocardial infarction were placed on total cardiopulmonary bypass for detailed study of the endocardial and epicardial activation during VT under hemodynamically stable conditions. Thirteen morphologically distinct monomorphic VTs were investigated by simultaneous epicardial, endocardial, and intramural bipolar recordings. Local electrograms were used to generate computer-assisted isochronous-activation sequence maps. A complete reentry circuit could be mapped on the epicardial surface in 4 animals and on the endocardial surface in one other animal. In the remaining 8 animals, there was a gap period lasting 43-62 msec in the cardiac cycle during which no endocardial or epicardial activity was observed. In 6 of the 8 animals, bipolar intramural recordings from sites closely associated with regions of endocardial and epicardial conduction block showed intramural activity progressing slowly during the gap period. In these 6 animals, a reentry circuit could be completed by incorporating the local electrograms recorded from the intramural sites. VT could be reproducibly terminated by selectively rendering only these intramural sites refractory by critically timed extrastimuli that failed to result in global ventricular capture. VT could be terminated by epicardial cooling in 2 of the 4 animals with epicardial reentry. By contrast, epicardial cryoablation did not effect intramural reentry and failed to interrupt VT. In this study, intramural pathways constituted an integral part of the reentry circuit in a large proportion of the VTs.\r"

  ".U": "87244758\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the kinetics of closure of sodium channels using single-channel recordings in cell-attached and excised membrane patches of rabbit ventricular myocytes. Sodium-channel closure was dependent on membrane potential. The closing rate initially decreased with depolarization. The rate then passed through a minimum and increased at strongly depolarized potentials. We attempted to determine the separate voltage dependence of the deactivation and inactivation rate constants using the method of Aldrich, Corey, and Stevens. In a majority of experiments, the method did not give internally consistent results. As an alternative approach, batrachotoxin was used to remove inactivation and determine the voltage dependence of deactivation rate. The deactivation rate decreased with depolarization. To account for the increase in the closing rate at strongly depolarized test potentials, one must postulate voltage dependence of inactivation. The ensemble average current relaxed with a time course that was usually best described by the sum of two exponentials. The larger of the two rate constants that described the relaxation was strongly voltage-dependent, increasing with depolarization. The larger rate constant may reflect voltage-dependent inactivation. We found evidence of two possible mechanisms for the slow component of relaxation: 1) cardiac sodium channels may open repetitively during a given depolarizing epoch, and 2) channels may return from the inactivated state with low probability and burst for as much as 200 msec with open times that are longer than those during usual gating. The slow component appears to be more prominent in cardiac muscle than in nerve and may play an important role in the control of the action potential duration and the inotropic state of the heart.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relative importance of protein degradation in the development of starvation-induced cardiac atrophy, in vivo fractional synthetic rates of total cardiac protein, myosin heavy chain, actin, light chain 1, and light chain 2 were measured in fed and fasted rabbits by continuous infusion of [3H] leucine. In addition, the rate of left ventricular protein accumulation and loss were assessed in weight-matched control and fasted rabbits. Rates of total cardiac protein degradation were then estimated as the difference between rates of synthesis and growth. Fasting produced left ventricular atrophy by decreasing the rate of left ventricular protein synthesis (34.8 +/- 1.4, 27.3 +/- 3.0, and 19.3 +/- 1.2 mg/day of left ventricular protein synthesized for 0-, 3-, and 7-day fasted rabbits, respectively). Inhibition of contractile protein synthesis was evident by significant reductions in the fractional synthetic rates of all myofibrillar protein subunits. Although fractional rates of protein degradation increased significantly within 7 days of fasting, actual amounts of left ventricular protein degraded per day were unaffected. Thus, prolonged fasting profoundly inhibits the synthesis of new cardiac protein, including the major protein constituents of the myofibril. Both this inhibition in new protein synthesis as well as a smaller but significant reduction in the average half-lives of cardiac proteins are responsible for atrophy of the heart in response to fasting.\r"

We tested whether varying levels of vagal-sympathetic input could yield the same spontaneous sinus cycle length but also alter effective refractory periods of the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle and AV nodal conduction times. Dogs anesthetized by alpha-chloralose were studied in the open-chest, neurally decentralized state. In 10 dogs, sinus cycle length was maintained constant during 3 levels of bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation (4 msec, 3 mA at 1, 2, and 4 Hz) by titrating simultaneous bilateral vagal stimulation (varying pulse width and frequency). Each combination of ansae subclaviae-vagal stimulation yielded the same sinus cycle length as the control value, but refractory periods of right atrium and right and left ventricles shortened progressively as the frequency of ansae subclaviae stimulation increased. Atrioventricular nodal conduction time (AH interval) shortened in 2 dogs and lengthened in 3 dogs. His-Purkinje conduction time (HV interval) was unchanged. In 9 dogs, the effect of simultaneous unilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation at 2 Hz and ipsilateral vagal stimulation that yielded the same sinus cycle length were determined. Right-sided ansae subclaviae-vagal stimulation shortened refractoriness of right atrium and anterior left ventricle significantly. The AH interval lengthened in 1 dog. Left ansae subclaviae-vagal stimulation shortened the refractory periods of anterior and posterior left ventricle significantly and reduced the AH interval in 3 dogs. In 8 dogs, the effects of bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation alone at 2 Hz, vagal stimulation alone at an intensity required to keep the sinus cycle length constant during ansae subclaviae stimulation, and simultaneous bilateral ansae subclaviae and vagal stimulation were tested. The right atrial refractory period was shortened significantly by ansae subclaviae stimulation alone and by vagal stimulation alone and was shortened further by simultaneous stimulation of both autonomic limbs. The right and left ventricular refractory periods were shortened by ansae subclaviae stimulation alone and by simultaneous stimulation of both limbs but tended to be prolonged by vagal stimulation alone and when added to ansae subclaviae stimulation. In 7 dogs, the effects of simultaneous stimulation of bilateral ansae subclaviae at 2 Hz and vagi at intensities that maintained the AH interval constant at an atrial pacing cycle length of 300 msec were determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thromboxane A2 (TXA2)/prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) are potent vasoconstrictors whose contractile effects are mediated by increases in cellular calcium. Stable analogues of these compounds have shown calcium ionophore activity at high concentrations. To determine if effects of TXA2/PGH2 analogues on 45Ca2+ fluxes are receptor mediated, the effects of the stable TXA2/PGH2 mimetic U46619 and the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist I-PTA-OH on 45Ca/+ fluxes in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells were studied. The smooth muscle cells were cultured from human saphenous vein explants, and they retained the morphologic and immunologic characteristics of vascular smooth muscle cells. U46619 stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 398 +/- 26 nM (n = 4). The maximal 45Ca2+ efflux in response to U46619 (5 microM) was significantly greater (p = 0.006) than the 45Ca2+ efflux induced by KCl (40 mM). I-PTA-OH inhibited the U46619-induced 45Ca2+ efflux but had no effect on KCl-induced 45Ca2+ efflux. These results suggest that the effects of U46619 in increasing vascular smooth muscle cell calcium efflux are receptor mediated. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells with functional TXA2/PGH2 receptors were cultured from human saphenous veins and provide a potentially useful in vitro system for the further study of TXA2/PGH2 receptor-mediated phenomena in human vascular tissue.\r"

Average valve gradient was reduced from 47.5 to 27 mm Hg. Obstruction at the conduit-branch pulmonary artery connection became apparent after dilatation of the valve. These distal stenoses were also dilated. BD technique was tested in vitro with the use of nonstenotic valves in fresh conduits. No damage to the valve or to the conduit was found when oversized balloons were used in a standard fashion or intentionally inflated until rupture. It is concluded that conduit replacement may be deferred by balloon dilatation of obstructed biological valves and/or a stenotic conduit-pulmonary artery anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that pretreatment with adequate antiplatelet therapy reduces the likelihood of acute coronary thrombosis during routine percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we reviewed, blinded to treatment group, the films and records of 300 consecutive initially successful PTCAs. Films before PTCA, immediately after, and at least 30 min after the last balloon inflation were assessed for the presence of any thrombus at the PTCA site. We excluded 37 patients who received streptokinase before PTCA or who had 100% occlusion or thrombus on pre-PTCA films. New thrombi were classified as clinically significant (defined as causing 100% occlusion or requiring emergency surgery or streptokinase therapy) or as not significant (not causing an acute problem or requiring intervention). Patients were classified into three groups, based on the type and extent of antiplatelet therapy received. Group 1 (no aspirin, n = 121) consisted of patients who did not receive aspirin either before admission or in hospital before PTCA (with or without dipyridamole). Group 2 (standard treatment, n = 110) received aspirin with or without dipyridamole but did not receive both drugs before admission and in hospital before PTCA. Group 3 (maximal treatment, n = 32) received both aspirin and dipyridamole before admission and in hospital before PTCA. New thrombi were detected at 39 (14.8%) PTCA sites, of which 15 (5.7% of all PTCA sites) were considered clinically significant. Group 1 had the highest incidence of both thrombus (21.5%) and clinically significant thrombus (10.7%). A reduction was seen in group 2 in thrombus (11.8%; p = .07) and in clinically significant thrombus (1.8%; p = .005). Group 3 had no thrombus (p = .001) and no clinically significant thrombus (p = .04). In addition to inadequate pretreatment with antiplatelet therapy, univariate analyses demonstrated several other risk factors for thrombus: higher percent diameter stenosis before PTCA (p less than .008), higher platelet count (p = .013), and current smoking (p = .03). Only higher platelet count (p less than .001) and inadequate pretreatment (p = .001) were associated with clinically significant thrombus. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that for thrombus, the lack of effective antiplatelet therapy was the most discriminatory variable, followed by current smoking, higher percent diameter stenosis, and dissection. For clinically significant thrombus, once the lack of pretreatment with effective antiplatelet therapy was considered, no other factors added significant discriminatory information.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients were given an initial test dose of 60 mg diltiazem or 20 mg nifedipine followed by consecutive hourly doses until a 50% fall in pulmonary vascular resistance and 33% fall in pulmonary arterial pressure was achieved or untoward side effects developed. The initial drug challenges failed to produce significant reductions in mean pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance. In eight of 13 patients, continued hourly doses produced a reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 48% (61 to 35 mm Hg, p less than .01) and a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance of 60% (15 to 6 units, p less than .01). These patients were discharged on high-dose (up to 720 mg/day diltiazem or 240 mg/day nifedipine) calcium channel-blocking drugs as long-term therapy. Five patients have returned for restudy after 1 year. In four of five the reductions in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were sustained and were associated with regression of right ventricular hypertrophy as assessed by electrocardiography and echocardiography. One patient who reduced her dose to a conventional level had a return of her pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance toward previous levels. We conclude that substantial reductions in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance that are associated with regression of right ventricular hypertrophy are possible in some patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by use of calcium channel-blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rheologic measurements included hematocrit, whole blood and plasma viscosity (750 and 1500 sec-1), degree of red cell aggregation via the zeta sedimentation ratio, and the extent and rate of red cell aggregation after stasis (Myrenne aggregometer). Compared with normal control donors, salient observations in the patients as a group included: a small (6%) but significant increase in hematocrit, a significant elevation in plasma viscosity (9%), significant increases in whole blood viscosity at both shear rates (14% and 16%), significant increases in the degree (12%), the extent (41%), and the rate (28% faster time constant) of red cell aggregation, an elevated alpha 2 level (15% increase) and a significantly increased fibrinogen concentration (25% increase), both of which correlated with the enhanced red cell aggregation. Rheologic abnormalities were evident when patients with disease in either one vessel or two to three vessels were compared with controls, but differences between these subgroups of patients were not significant. We conclude that patients with angina have rheologic abnormalities that are compatible with disturbed blood flow and an enhanced tendency for coronary arterial thrombosis.\r"

The lengths of time that SMVs could produce hemodynamic work as left ventricular assist devices were recorded. After 4 hr of continuous pumping at approximately 55 beats/min, six of eight SMVs were able to generate systolic pressures of 128 +/- 23 mm Hg and flows of 340 +/- 31 ml/min, representing 20 +/- 4% of the animals' cardiac output. After 8 hr of continuous pumping, five of the eight SMVs generated pressures of 110 +/- 15 mm Hg and flows of 308 +/- 88 ml/min, or 15 +/- 7% of the animals' cardiac output. The stroke work produced by the SMVs was intermediate between that of the animals' left and right ventricles. Although the SMVs were stimulated to contract at only about one-third the heart rate, the power output of the SMVs approximated that of the right ventricles because of the greater stroke work of the SMVs. Two SMVs functioned as LVADs for 14 hr. Deterioration in SMV function eventually occurred. In each case, however, complications such as anemia, hypoxia, and hypotension, which are inherent to prolonged short-term experiments of this type, contributed to the deterioration of SMV function. The results presented here suggest that skeletal muscle has the potential to directly support the circulation; however, the length of time such muscle pumps are capable of functioning has yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "During acute myocardial ischemia, there exists a zone of myocardial dysfunction that surrounds the central ischemic area that has been termed the functional border zone. We hypothesized that this nonischemic but dysfunctional myocardium may respond to an inotropic challenge. To address this issue, we studied 11 open-chest dogs during acute left circumflex (LCx) occlusion. Simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiograms and radioactive microsphere injections were used to create circumferential left ventricular flow-function maps at the papillary muscle level. Serial studies were performed at baseline, 15 min after LCx occlusion, and after the infusion of dobutamine during LCx occlusion. After occlusion, wall thickening decreased from 52 +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM) to -5 +/- 5% (p less than .01) in the central ischemic zone. The extent of left ventricular dysfunction measured 170 +/- 11 degrees while the subendocardial hypoperfusion zone was 130 +/- 9 degrees (p less than .05), resulting in a functional border zone of 40 +/- 11 degrees. During the infusion of dobutamine, wall thickening did not change in the central ischemic zone but increased adjacent to the functional border zone (p less than .01) and in the normal zone (p less than .05), reducing the extent of the functional border zone to 19 +/- 16 degrees (p less than .05). After dobutamine, the slope of transition of wall thickening from nonischemic to ischemic zones, measured directly from the left ventricular function map, increased on the free wall border (0.71 +/- 0.11 to 0.95 +/- 0.10, p less than .02) to a greater extent than on the septal border (0.60 +/- 0.08 to 0.73 +/- 0.06, p = .07). We conclude that nonischemic myocardium adjacent to ischemic tissue responds to inotropic challenge, dobutamine produces a significant decrease in the size of the functional border zone, and dynamic changes in wall thickening after inotropic intervention are greater in the functional border zone of the lateral free wall than at the septal border of the ischemic area.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been demonstrated that acute hypercholesterolemia per se, independently of its atherogenic effect, increases the extent of myocardial injury in rabbits undergoing coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion. Estimation of myocardial blood flow after reperfusion indicated that this deleterious effect was due to a vascular obstruction that limited the efficacy of reperfusion. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role played by platelets in contributing to the occurrence of this deleterious effect. Accordingly, New Zealand White rabbits were fed a standard laboratory chow diet (plasma cholesterol 67 +/- 12 mg/dl) or a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 3 days (plasma cholesterol 329 +/- 70 mg/dl). In a first series of experiments autologous platelets were labeled with 111In-oxine. After labeling, platelets were reinjected in the same animal and 30 min later coronary artery occlusion (CAO) was induced. CAO was maintained for 30 min followed by 5.5 hr of reperfusion. The animals were then killed, their hearts were excised, and each left ventricle was divided into ischemic and normally perfused samples. Myocardial samples were then counted in a gamma counter. Platelet accumulation ratio, i.e., 111In activity in the ischemic myocardium per gram of tissue divided by 111In activity in the normal myocardium per gram of tissue, was calculated. The ratio was 2.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SEM) in controls (n = 7) and 10.3 +/- 1.0 in the cholesterol-fed group (n = 6, p less than .001), indicating that a marked accumulation of platelets occurs in the ischemic myocardium of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. To evaluate the importance of this phenomenon, another series of experiments was performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These compounds were administered before and after a 30 min intracoronary infusion of the phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine (300 micrograms/min). Acetylcholine, ATP, and arachidonic acid produced significant (p less than .05) increases in transmural blood flow and in the ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial blood flow (endo/epi) when compared with control. Infusion of quinacrine did not affect this ratio and did not block the increase in transmural blood flow produced by each agent; however, it did block the redistribution of flow to the subendocardium. In contrast, there was no change in endo/epi during intracoronary infusion of nifedipine before and after quinacrine. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent vasodilators produce a preferential increase in subendocardial perfusion via a product of unsaturated fatty acid metabolism.\r"

Aortic regurgitation was produced in 18 open-chest dogs by extensively cutting one of the three aortic cusps with a nerve knife introduced via the cardiac apex. The dogs were separated into three groups of six dogs each. In each group the noncoronary cusp (NCC), the right coronary cusp (RCC), or the left coronary cusp (LCC) was cut. Aortic and left ventricular pressures; the phasic aortic, left anterior descending (LAD), and right coronary artery (RCA) blood flows; and electrocardiograms were simultaneously recorded before and after production of acute AR. All dogs in the NCC and RCC groups survived for at least 30 to 60 min, but all dogs in the LCC group died after 5 to 9 min of production of acute AR due to left ventricular failure. After 2 min of aortic regurgitation, the total, systolic, and diastolic LAD flows were 39 +/- 14, 19 +/- 9, and 20 +/- 8 ml/min (mean +/- SD) in the NCC group, 41 +/- 15, 31 +/- 9, and 10 +/- 6 ml/min in the RCC group, and 9 +/- 5, 19 +/- 5, and -10 +/- 2 ml/min in the LCC group, respectively.

We used an experimental preparation of the disease that consisted of a study of the microcirculation of 45 cardiomyopathic Syrian and 18 control hamsters with timed plasma staining. To investigate dynamic vascular disorders a double injection technique was used that permitted demonstration of all permanently and temporarily perfused capillaries in the same animal. The results showed a total capillary density of 3423 +/- 470 capillaries/mm2 in the cardiomyopathic hamster during the premyocytolic phase (30 days of age) and that of 3289 +/- 506 capillaries/mm2 during the myocytolytic phase (44 days). These values were not significantly different from those in the control group (3349 +/- 473 capillaries/mm2 at 30 days and 3383 +/- 556 capillaries/mm2 at 44 days). However, tissue areas with extended coronary transit times were detected only in the cardiomyopathic hamsters. These areas were of the same individual and cumulative size at 30 days (diameter approximately 200 micron, 4% of the tissue) as the myocytolytic zones at 44 days. In cardiomyopathic hamsters verapamil and hydralazine prevented both hypoperfusion and myocytolysis. The results favor the view that microcirculatory disorders generate tissue damage in the cardiomyopathic hamster and that these disorders can be prevented through treatment with the calcium antagonist verapamil or with the vasodilator hydralazine.\r"

  ".W": "Long RP' supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) often demonstrate both slow and decremental conduction properties in the retrograde pathway of the reentrant circuit. The electrophysiologic properties of these pathways are poorly understood. We studied 10 patients with long RP' SVT (RP'/RR, 0.52 to 0.71); five had the unusual form of atrioventricular nodal reentry (fast-slow) and five patients had accessory AV pathways with slow, decremental retrograde conduction properties. During SVT, the effects of intravenous adenosine (37.5 to 150 micrograms/kg), which increases potassium current (iK) in supraventricular tissue and hyperpolarizes membrane potential toward Ek (-90 mV), and the response to slow-inward channel blockade with verapamil (0.10 to 0.20 mg/kg iv) were evaluated. Adenosine and verapamil has similar effects in the presence of fast-slow AV nodal reentry since both agents terminated SVT by producing block in the retrograde slow AV nodal pathway. In contrast, adenosine and verapamil had differential effects on retrograde conduction in decremental accessory pathways. Adenosine terminated all episodes of SVT in the retrograde decremental pathway, whereas verapamil had a direct effect on this tissue in only two of five patients. Decremental retrograde accessory pathways can therefore demonstrate at least two types of electrophysiologic responses. Pathways that respond only to adenosine-induced hyperpolarizing K+ current likely comprise depressed fast-Na+ channel tissue, i.e., partially depolarized (greater than -60 to -70 mV) atrial tissue. In contrast, decremental accessory pathways that respond to both modulation of the slow-inward calcium current and K+ conductance have pharmacologic properties similar to those of the AV node and may represent more completely depolarized atrial fibers with resting membrane potentials of -60 mV or less.\r"

A decrease in resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, and maximum rate of upstroke velocity was noted in each tissue sample, was greatest nearest the site of energy delivery, and was of graded severity at increasing distances from the crater edge. The extent of injury, as indexed by changes in action potential variables and necrosis, histologically determined, was greater for tissues exposed to high-energy shocks. The relatively focal injury after argon laser photoablation may explain the lower incidence of arrhythmias and hemodynamic dysfunction noted with the use of this method of ablation in vivo.\r"

Action potentials were recorded from the epicardial surface in the center of a preparation having nearly uniform fiber orientation (25 X 25 mm). Stimuli applied just adjacent to the recording site produced nearly centrifugal propagation. An activation sequence either parallel (longitudinal) or perpendicular (transverse) to the long axis of the muscle fibers was produced by peripheral stimulation. Action potential duration at -60 mV (APD-60 mV) during centrifugal propagation was significantly longer than that during longitudinal propagation. Further shortening of APD-60 mV was observed during transverse propagation. When a collision of longitudinal or transverse wavefronts (longitudinal or transverse collision) was produced at the action potential recording site, the shortest APD was recorded. During centrifugal propagation, action potential mapping around the stimulating electrodes revealed that APD-60 mV shortened gradually as the recording site was moved further from the stimulation site. The spatial gradient of APD was steeper in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction, causing a distortion in the repolarization sequence and the recovery of excitability near the center of the tissue. Premature stimuli applied to an area near the central stimulation site induced one-way block and circus movement of the wavefront, indicating reentry of excitation. We concluded that the activation sequence and anisotropic cellular geometry substantially affect APD, and that such a change contributes to the spatial inhomogeneity of refractoriness leading to reentrant arrhythmias.\r"

Computer techniques of digital averaging and digital band-pass filtering were applied. Signals were obtained from epicardial electrodes placed in the ischemic left ventricular region and on the noninjured right ventricular surface, and from the body surface electrocardiogram. All recordings were made simultaneously before, during, and after coronary occlusion and subjected to the same analysis. The waveforms obtained from the ischemic left ventricular region showed a considerable decrease in high-frequency content, while those obtained from the noninjured right ventricular surface remained unchanged. The results correlated with the appearance of a zone of reduced amplitude in the body surface high-frequency QRS complex. Therefore, this macroscopic phenomenon measured noninvasively from the body surface is explained by local reduction of high-frequency activity in the ischemic region of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was designed to calculate left ventricular maximum time-varying elastance (Emax), to define the relationship between Emax and pressure-volume (P-V) relations at other, more easily defined measured of end-systole, and to determine whether these measures of left ventricular contractile function can be normalized in man. Accordingly, we studied 10 subjects with simultaneous high-fidelity micromanometer left ventricular and ascending aortic pressure recordings and biplane contrast cineangiograms at control conditions and during infusion of methoxamine and nitroprusside. Emax was defined as the maximum slope of the linear relation of isochronal, instantaneous P-V data points obtained from each of the three loading conditions. Left ventricular end-systole was also defined for each loading condition as: the time of the maximum P-V ratio (maxPV), minimum ventricular volume (minPV), (-)dP/dtmin [(-)dP/dtPV], and zero systolic flow approximated by the central aortic dicrotic notch (AodiPV). The mean heart rates and LV (+)dP/dtmax were insignificantly altered during the three loading conditions. Isochronal Emax ranged from 3.38 to 6.73 mm Hg/ml (mean 5.48 +/- 1.23 [SD] mm Hg/ml) and the volume-axis intercepts at zero pressure ranged from -2 to 51 ml (mean 18 +/- 16 ml). The isochronal slope calculations were reproducible (r = .97 to .99). The end-systolic P-V slope values for the maxPV, minPV, (-)dP/dtPV, and AodiPV relations correlated with isochronal Emax (r = .90, .88, .69, and .74, respectively). The average slope values for these end-systolic P-V relations, however, underestimated the mean Emax (p less than .01 to p less than .001). The mean extrapolated volume-axis intercepts for these end-systolic P-V relations also underestimated that for Emax. Finally, the isochronal Emax and other end-systolic P-V relation slope values demonstrated inverse linear relationships with left ventricular mass (r = -.68 to -.91, p less than .05 to p less than .001). Only the Emax volume-axis intercepts showed a linear relationship with left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = .75). Thus we conclude that the time-varying elastic properties of the left ventricle can be calculated in man, that commonly used end-systolic P-V relations significantly underestimate isochronal Emax, and that normalization of isochronal Emax and other end-systolic P-V relation slope values might be performed in man with left ventricular mass; no obvious relationship between volume-axis intercepts and measures of left ventricular or body size was apparent.\r"

There were 101 cardiac deaths, 71 (70%) of which were sudden (instantaneous or found dead). Multivariate analysis with log rank testing and the Cox proportional hazards model showed that end-systolic volume (chi 2 = 82.9) had greater predictive value for survival than end-diastolic volume (chi 2 = 59.0) or ejection fraction (chi 2 = 46.6), whereas stepwise analysis showed that once the relationship between survival and end-systolic volume had been fitted, there was no additional significant predictive information in either end-diastolic volume or ejection fraction. Severity of coronary occlusions and stenoses showed additional prediction of only borderline significance (p = .04 in one analysis), but continued cigarette smoking did remain an independent risk factor after stepwise analysis.

We used Doppler echocardiography to investigate the effects of increasing heart rate on stroke volume and ventricular output in the normal human fetal heart. Heart rate was increased in 25 human fetuses (mean age 36 weeks) by auditory stimulation with a sound emitter placed on the mother's abdomen. Aortic or pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional areas were calculated. Blood flow velocity spectra from the pulmonary artery or aorta were digitized to obtain flow velocity integrals before and after auditory stimulation. Stroke volume was calculated as the product of the flow velocity integral and the area of the great vessel. Prestimulation mean heart rate was 132 +/- 8 beats/min and increased after auditory stimulation to 158 +/- 9 beats/min (p less than .001). Stroke volume decreased with the increase in heart rate from 3.7 +/- 1.4 ml before stimulation to 3.0 +/- 1.1 ml after stimulation (p less than .001), but ventricular output calculated as the product of stroke volume and heart rate remained unchanged (0.48 +/- 0.18 liter/min before vs 0.48 +/- 0.17 liter/min after stimulation). The decrease in stroke volume was accompanied by a decrease in ventricular end-diastolic area, although there was no change either in end-systolic area or fractional change in area. This study demonstrates that increases in heart rate within the physiologic range in the normal human fetus result in a decrease in ventricular size and stroke volume but no change in ventricular output or ventricular shortening.\r"

Forty-two surgical cases of prolapsed valves with mitral and/or aortic regurgitation were reviewed (AVP in nine, MVP in 27, and combined AVP and MVP [CVP] in six). On microscopic examination, myxomatous degeneration was observed in 20 patients, including six with AVP, 13 with MVP, and one with CVP. In the other 22 patients, including three with AVP, 14 with MVP, and five with CVP, microscopic examination revealed fibrosis with vascularization and scattered infiltration of inflammatory round cells caused by postinflammatory changes with or without chronic inflammation. We coined the term \"postinflammatory valve prolapse\" (PIVP) to describe these valves. Both postinflammatory and myxomatous degeneration were observed in seven patients with floppy mitral valves attributable to PIVP. Rupture of chordae tendineae was present in six patients with myxomatous mitral valve and three with PIVP. Seven patients with PIVP had a history of rheumatic fever. The results suggest that valvular prolapse is produced not only by myxomatous degeneration but also by postinflammatory changes, including those caused by rheumatic fever.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied 16 patients with isolated aortic stenosis and eight with isolated aortic regurgitation undergoing aortic valve replacement, using two-dimensional echocardiography preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 41 +/- 7 days postoperatively to calculate the intraoperative change in afterload, quantify the postoperative changes in left ventricular chamber size, architecture, load and function, determine whether the postoperative left ventricular remodeling correlated with the intraoperative change in afterload in aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, and assess whether preoperative afterload excess precluded postoperative improvement in left ventricular function. Preoperative left ventricular mass, end-systolic meridional and circumferential wall stresses, ejection fraction, and stress-shortening relations in patients with aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation were similar. However, our patients with aortic regurgitation had severe systolic dysfunction, with ejection fraction less than 55% in all but one patient, compared with only 10 of 16 patients with aortic stenosis. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume, mass/volume ratio, and chamber shape were significantly different in patients with aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation (174 +/- 64 vs 294 +/- 140 ml, p less than .01; 1.81 +/- 0.63 vs 1.14 +/- 0.18, p less than .01; and 0.59 +/- 0.09 vs 0.69 +/- 0.09, p less than .05, respectively). Intraoperative end-systolic meridional and circumferential stresses fell significantly in patients with aortic stenosis but remained unchanged in those with aortic regurgitation. The changes in left ventricular volume and ejection fraction during early postoperative remodeling (6 weeks) correlated with the intraoperative change in afterload in patients with aortic stenosis. In contrast, there was no intraoperative change in afterload in patients with aortic regurgitation and no significant changes in left ventricular volume, architecture, or function at 6 weeks or at 6 months. The differences in left ventricular remodeling and changes in function between patients with aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation in the early postoperative period most probably relates to the major difference in intraoperative reduction in afterload, although a contributory role may have been played by the preoperative left ventricular dysfunction in those with aortic regurgitation that was underestimated by measurement of ejection fraction.\r"

The clinical and pathological findings of the two conditions were similar. After a mean follow-up period of 5 years, 72 patients (56%) with HS nephritis and 67 (32%) with IgA nephropathy showed no demonstrable abnormality, 29 (23%) with HS nephritis and 103 (50%) with IgA nephropathy had minor urinary abnormalities, 7 (5%) with HS nephritis and 26 (13%) with IgA nephropathy had heavy proteinuria and/or hypertension, and 20 (16%) with HS nephritis and 10 (5%) with IgA nephropathy had developed chronic renal failure. A worse outcome was significantly associated with the more severe clinical presentations and more severe glomerular changes by light microscopy in HS nephritis, whereas there was no relationship between the severity of clinical presentation and glomerular changes and prognosis in IgA nephropathy. These findings suggest that HS nephritis is an acute disease and prognosis is associated with the severity of glomerular changes at onset, while IgA nephropathy is a chronic, slowly progressive glomerular disease.\r"

No patients with painful arthritis received this operation if they were beyond 50 years of age. Sixty-seven patients were followed for three to 25 years after surgery and none have yet developed painful pantrapezial arthritis. Many are still at an age when arthritis is not a problem. A colleague contributed a case of a 60-year-old patient who received a carpometacarpal arthrodesis and who later developed painful arthritis of the adjacent joints. This case demonstrates the need for restraint in using this procedure for the alleviation of arthritis pain in patients over 50 years of age.\r"

To determine the role of osteonecrosis in these failures, the viability of bone within the femoral head was determined by histologic examination of bone inside 25 failed femoral resurfacing components. The bone was substantially alive throughout the femoral head in 23 of 25 cases (92%). In two cases, the bone of the femoral head was dead. Both of these hips had clinically failed because of femoral neck fracture. This histologic evaluation indicates that bone death is not an inevitable consequence of femoral head resurfacing and the use of polymethylmethacrylate fixation.\r"

Two 9-mm holes are drilled anteriorly through the proximal femoral cortex before cement is removed. These holes permit direct visualization of the medullary canal and help to prevent eccentric reaming or inadvertent perforation with the power drill. They also provide portals for enhanced irrigation, illumination, and cement removal. For assessment of the effect of cortical perforations on bone strength, 12 cadaveric femurs containing cemented prosthetic stems were analyzed. The femurs were stressed at various loads on the Instron Materials Testing Machine (Instro Engineering Corporation, Kenton, MA) under conditions simulating single-limb stance. The stress concentrations were significantly higher about laterally drilled holes than about those located anteriorly. When loaded to failure, all fractures occurred at or below the prosthetic stem tip. No fractures occurred in the proximally placed drill holes. A finite element model showed that two holes kept at least two hole diameters apart did not cause cumulative stress concentration.\r"

The radius of curvature of three of the four rods analyzed fell beyond the spectrum of radii found in the human femurs. A concomitant investigation of the most appropriate proximal entry site for an intramedullary rod was done based on the patterns of exit sites for both flexible guide wires and two intramedullary rods introduced in a retrograde fashion from the intercondylar notch in 14 matched pairs of human femora. The most appropriate area for proximal access into the medullary canal for these devices would appear to be at the junction of the femoral neck and the greater trochanter slightly anterior to or in the pyriformis recess.\r"

The follow-up period ranged from two and one-half to five years (average, 3.6 years). Before surgery, all patients complained of varying degrees of pain.

Lachman's test was positive in 14 patients; anterior drawer test was 3+ in ten patients and 2+ in four patients; and pivot shift test was positive in 13 patients. Anteromedial instability of 1+ was present in five patients; combined straight, anteromedial, and posterolateral instability in four patients; and anterolateral in one patient. Ten patients sustained a tear of the medial meniscus, two of the medial and lateral menisci, and one of the lateral meniscus. Chondromalacia and degenerative changes of the knee were noted in nine patients. After operation, four patients complained of aching sensation during weather changes and two of aching in the patellar region after strenuous sports activities.

Four fresh cadaver knees were fitted with Lenox Hill knee braces according to the manufacturer's guidelines. A computer-assisted testing apparatus was constructed that allowed each knee to be tested as a function of knee flexion angle, joint load, and soft tissue integrity. Each knee served as its own control. While 45 kg of anterior force was applied to the tibia of the anterior cruciate ligament deficient knees, the Lenox Hill knee brace was able to decrease anterior translation from an average of 10 mm, to 5.7 mm, at 30 degrees of flexion when no vertical load was present. This limiting effect was lost when the medial collateral ligament was sectioned in addition to the anterior cruciate ligament or when both the medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were sectioned along with the anterior cruciate ligament. When 20 Newton-meters (Nm) of torque was applied to the femurs at 30 degrees of flexion without vertical load, the Lenox Hill knee brace limited external rotation of the tibia in all tested categories. For intact knees at 30 degrees of flexion and no vertical load, the Lenox Hill knee brace decreased external rotation from 18 degrees to 10 degrees. In the anterior cruciate ligament-sectioned knees, external rotation was decreased from an average of 20.2 degrees to 16.1 degrees. In the knees with sectioned anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments, the average reduction was from 21.2 degrees to 15.4 degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The scintigraphic evolution of areas of abnormal tibial activity, graded according to a 1 to 4 rating system and their corresponding clinical courses, were analyzed in 27 military recruits, as part of a prospective study. Disappearance of pain correlated with scintigraphic healing and increased pain with progression to stress fracture. Decreased or persistent pain had equivocal scintigraphic correlation. Eight of 14 nondiscrete scintigraphic lesions disappeared in spite of continuous training by the recruits; four such lesions, however, progressed to stress fractures. This uncertainty of progression suggests that military recruits and people training for sports who have such scintigraphic activity should have a brief rest period and proper monitoring before resuming training.\r"

Forty-one patients (48 +/- 10 years of age) had a portion of their fibula removed for a bone graft. At evaluation 27 +/- 8 months later, 24 had no pain, 11 mild pain, and six moderate or severe pain. Sixteen had no complaints of any kind, but four without pain had minor difficulties with vigorous activities, and three complained of ankle swelling. There were no differences in range of motion between the operated and nonoperated side. Average muscle torque was lower on the operated than on the nonoperated side, but this difference was statistically significant only for ankle evertors in men. This study demonstrates that most patients will have subjective complaints and mild muscular weakness after removal of a portion of the fibula.\r"

Evaluation included clinical assessment followed by quantitative determination of intracompartmental pressures as monitored by wick or slit catheters before and after exercise. Intramuscular pressures measuring greater than or equal to 10 mmHg at rest and/or greater than or equal to 25 mmHg five minutes after exercise were defined as abnormally elevated. The patients with chronic compartment syndrome described reproducible exertional anterolateral leg pain, and 39% of these patients had a fascial hernia. Such a defect was present in less than five percent of the normal volunteers. Nonsurgical treatment was selected by five patients and all five reported persistent inability to participate in athletics because of their exertional pain. Of the remaining 13 patients, 12 were treated by decompressive fasciotomy and 11 of the 12 (92%) had pain relief and increased exercise tolerance. A single patient had had fascial closure instead of fasciotomy, and this procedure produced an acute compartment syndrome. Effective treatment of the chronic compartment syndrome consists of reduction of exertional activities or surgical decompression by fasciotomy.\r"

Following immobilization and fracture union at three weeks, one ankle on each rabbit underwent passive exercise daily until sacrifice at six weeks. The contralateral ankle remained immobile, except for weekly stiffness determinations. Passive exercise produced limb swelling and resulted in temporarily decreased ankle stiffness to, but not significantly below, control values. Between exercise sessions, the exercised ankles became significantly stiffer than the contralateral immobilized ankles. The cause of stiffness was not determined, but extrapolation from other work would suggest that the regimens of intermittent passive exercise tested in this study additionally traumatized the healing tissues surrounding the fracture.\r"

During simultaneous isometric contraction at 5 degrees knee flexion, an anterior drawer force equivalent to 15% of the tension of the quadriceps was exerted to the tibia, and decreased with increased angle of flexion. The mean angle at which this force became zero was 7.4 degrees, with a standard deviation of 5.0 degrees. When the angle increased further, a posterior drawer force to the tibia occurred and gradually increased. Each tension of the quadriceps or hamstrings during maximum simultaneous isometric contraction of the quadriceps and hamstrings was estimated as 30%-60% of that during separate isometric contractions of each muscle. In the early stage of the rehabilitation after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the simultaneous isometric contraction of the quadriceps and the hamstrings is useful as one of the muscle exercise methods because it can be performed safely with the knee position near the full extension and can generate sufficient muscle force to be an effective exercise.\r"

A two-dimensional model was analyzed using roentgenographic films. In separate isometric contractions of the quadriceps, the mean value of the anterior drawer force was equivalent to 14% of the tension of the quadriceps at 5 degrees knee flexion. The value decreased with the increase in the angle of knee flexion. The mean angle at which the anterior drawer force became zero was 45.3 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees. When the angle was increased further, the posterior drawer force gradually increased. In separate isometric contractions of the hamstrings, the posterior drawer force was exerted at all angles of flexion. Thus, during the early stage of rehabilitation after the anterior cruciate ligament injury, the quadriceps exercise by isometric muscle contraction should be performed with the knee flexion at more than 70 degrees (mean +/- 1.96). Exercise of the hamstrings by isometric muscle contractions can be carried out regardless of flexion angle.\r"

This graft was successfully transplanted in mechanically induced defects in the surface of condylar articular cartilage of the tibiotarsal joint of four-month-old roosters. Healing of the defects was observed macroscopically, histologically, and histochemically and with the use of biochemical analyses for six months. Chondrocyte proliferation was seen 48 hours after implantation, and a hyaline cartilage matrix surrounding the cells was present two weeks later. Within eight weeks, the defects were completely filled with hyaline cartilage, which integrated smoothly with the neighboring cartilage without the formation of fibrous tissue at the interface. The cell content and rate of proteoglycan synthesis remained high for four months, then declined slowly to the level of the surrounding cartilage. Six months after transplantation, the cartilaginous tissue in the wound at levels below the ossification front showed penetration by vascular elements and young bone trabeculae at the margins of the reparative tissue. No signs of immunogenic rejection of the implants were observed. These results may be related to the employment of a capable source of cells, i.e., cultured chondrocytes characterized by a high mitotic rate and an early stage of development. The transplanted cells grew well and maintained their initial rate of proliferation, with definite maturation and transformation. The resulting cartilage was structurally reorganized according to the host pattern and under the influence of multitudinous environmental conditions. The articular zone preserved its cartilaginous phenotype, whereas the subchondral regions were transformed into bone.\r"

Total arthroplasty attempts to improve the results of resection or space-occupying arthroplasties which, while providing good pain relief, have offered little thumb stability, strength, or normal motion. Conditions of surrounding joints indicate that this disease process is not always a straightforward clinical presentation and that a variety of surgical options are needed. When joint disease is limited to the TMC joint, bone stock is good and there is no excessive heterotopic bone. A total arthroplasty can be considered in selected patients. Careful analysis of comparative series between silicone spacers and tendon spacers for trapezium resection arthroplasty demonstrates that both pinch strength and motion are somewhat less than with total trapezial arthroplasty. Key-type pinch rarely was over 50% of the normal and averaged less than 5 kg for both interposition and silicone arthroplasty. Continued problems with implant subluxation, silicone reactive synovitis, and other complications suggest that these resections (replacement) of the trapezium are not error-free and sacrifice thumb stability. With all types of thumb reconstruction, high precision technique is required. With improved biomaterials, thumb biomechanics, and better fixation techniques, more physiologic implant arthroplasties can be anticipated to improve the current designs of total joint arthroplasties.\r"

At an average follow-up examination of 5.2 years, 100% of the Stage I patients had achieved good or excellent results, having little or no pain with return of strength and stability. Eighty-two percent of Stage II patients had similar results. Intractable pain was the primary surgical indication. Pain was dramatically relieved in all Stage I cases and in 70% of the Stage II cases. The presence and degree of crepitus correlated closely to the result and was a good prognostic indicator. Direct inspection of both the basal and scaphotrapezial joints is essential to determine whether ligament reconstruction or another surgical procedure is the procedure of choice. The procedure was particularly useful in patients with untreated Bennett's fractures. Follow-up roentgenograms showed no further degeneration, suggesting that the procedure was reliable, reproducible, and durable, and that it might even retard future joint degeneration.\r"

The morphologic features of these facets, together with a lax but strong joint capsule, give the thumb great mobility and play a major role in the opposition of the thumb. Based on the kinematic behavior of the joint, it was given the functional status of a ball-and-socket joint. To analyze the motion patterns of the first metacarpal with regard to the trapezium, models were proposed based on the principles of regularly curved joint surfaces. However, it has been acknowledged that irregularly curved surfaces attuned to a specifically shaped ligamentous system offer the morphologic basis for understanding mobility at the base of the thumb. The stability of the first carpometacarpal joint is not guaranteed by joint surfaces and ligaments alone because differences in mobility between the anatomic bone-ligament specimen and the joint in vivo are conspicuous. The function of muscles crossing the joint is essential. The close structural relation between the tendon of the abductor pollicis longus and the first carpometacarpal joint was observed. Five distinguishable tendons of this muscle end at different parts of the joint. The interweaving of some of the tendons with the ligamentous system undoubtedly influences the restraining and directing function of the ligamentous system.\r"

Silicone synovitis is such a major concern that surgeons are now using allograft or autograft tendon as a spacer when resection arthroplasty of the trapezium is required.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic and therapeutic strategies described above have been presented sequentially for the sake of clarity, but in practice should be performed as quickly as possible in any infant who remains cyanotic despite receiving 100% oxygen. The practitioner must proceed with emergent stabilization of the infant with specific therapies for identified problems and nonspecific therapies for suspected problems, recognizing that the coexistence of two or more pathophysiologic entities is not uncommon. By the time of transport, the practitioner may have laid the groundwork for further diagnostic procedures and therapies by having already classified the infant into one of four primary pathophysiologic categories, as outlined in Table 4. Although congenital heart disease may be highly suspected, confirmation may not be possible without echocardiography. The practitioner, however, should not be discouraged by failure to achieve a specific etiologic diagnosis, despite careful analysis of all the information obtained from diagnostic evaluations prior to transport. Hypoxemia refractory to oxygen administration and assisted ventilation is found in many clinical conditions and results from a variety of pathophysiological disorders. The pediatrician caring for such an infant has primary responsibility for stabilization and preparation for transport of the infant to a Level III facility, and for communicating information about diagnostic procedures and therapeutic maneuvers that might facilitate extended resuscitative efforts by the neonatologist accepting responsibility for the transport and subsequent care of the infant.\r"

Intrinsic acute renal failure was diagnosed in two patients, one of whom died. In 10 cases, prerenal oliguria responded promptly to volume expansion with improvement of biochemical indices in Period II. In nine cases, urine volume was not altered, and all functional parameters were comparable with those of control.\r"

After exclusion of other causes for the symptoms, thyroid replacement therapy was started, resulting in rapid resolution of symptoms and return to euthyroid status.

Thirty-nine infants developed PIE before 1 day of age (early PIE). In the absence of infection, early PIE was associated with younger gestational age, lower birth weight, lower 1 and 5 minute Apgar scores, and higher mortality, as compared with patients in whom air leak occurred later. Survival in infants with PIE seemed to be influenced mainly by coexisting risk factors such as extreme prematurity, birth asphyxia, and perinatal infection. Most cases of early PIE in newborns less than 30 weeks gestational age occurred at peak ventilation pressures less than 25 cm H2O, and probably reflect increased sensitivity of the underdeveloped lung to barotrauma. In infants older than 30 weeks gestational age, early PIE was strongly associated with bacterial sepsis. These data indicate that the occurrence of PIE in the first 24 hours of life is a particularly ominous sign, and is frequently associated with clinical conditions which carry a poor prognosis.\r"

The ages ranged from 5 to 22 (mean 13.2) years, and 68 patients were females. All patients had a normal cardiovascular examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and 2D-echocardiogram. Maximal exercise tests were performed on a treadmill or bicycle ergometer, and flow volume loops were performed before and after exercise (n = 65). Exercise tests did not reveal any cardiovascular abnormalities, but 14 patients with chest pain (9.5%) and seven patients with DOE (21.2%) developed exercise-induced asthma. Postexercise decrease in peak expiratory flow rate was 26.2 +/- 3.7 percent in patients with chest pain and 39.4 +/- 8.9 percent in those with DOE. Only five patients had a personal history and four others had a family history of asthma. Seven patients had a personal or family history of allergies. Implications: exercise-induced asthma should be considered in pediatric patients with symptoms of chest pain or dyspnea on exertion; when exercise tests are performed, flow volume loops should be included before and after exercise; maximal exercise tests are unlikely to unmask any cardiovascular abnormalities in such patients.\r"

Of these, the temperament of 35 who had suffered a contusion, poisoning, burns, or other accidents were more closely analyzed. The results show that a disproportionate number of all hospitalized children had earlier been characterized as \"difficult\" in their temperament. This was typical, however, for both the accident group and other hospitalized children. The hospitalized children had a significantly more negative mood and higher intensity of responses to normal everyday life situations. The accident group differed from other hospitalized children in being mainly more persistent but also showed a tendency to higher activity level and negative reactions to new situations. The results do not support a straightforward hypothesis of an early accident prone temperament but point out the significance of temperament in the processes of hospitalization and accidents.\r"

Thus, there is a moral and ethical dilemma whether, for the sake of the potential intact survivors, the entire group should receive drastic life support. Today's neonatologist is caught in a crossfire of conflicting demands from families, referring physicians, federal and state regulations, hospital administrators, cost considerations, and personal ethical beliefs.\r"

This approach has evolved out of a concern that there have been some wrong decisions made by physicians and parents in which infants have died after treatments were inappropriately withheld or withdrawn. Infant bioethics committees consisting of multidisciplinary professional and lay members will attempt to assure the best interests of infants while maintaining parental discretion concerning decision making in most cases. It is our belief that these committees not only protect the interests of infants who might have treatment inappropriately withheld but also protect the interests of infants who can no longer be benefited by medical intervention. Furthermore, by increasing discussion and deliberation of these complex moral issues, the professional staff will be better able to deal with exigent situations and to provide thoughtful decision making in difficult cases. Finally, the role of the ethics committee will be to provide ethical comfort for staff and family alike in carrying out these difficult decisions for some of the most critically ill patients in our hospitals.\r"

We learned that writers of these reports relied on other case reports and generally ignored experimental literature.

  ".W": "Plasma concentrations of nortriptyline (NT) and its major metabolite 10-hydroxy-NT (10-OH-NT) were measured in 30 patients with depression, treated with NT for 3 weeks. Nine patients who recovered completely had plasma concentrations of NT and 10-OH-NT ranging from 358 to 728 nmol/L and from 428 to 688 nmol/L, respectively. Of the 21 patients who did not recover completely, only four had plasma concentrations within the window limited by these two plasma concentration ranges. A correlation was found between the degree of amelioration and the plasma concentration of NT (rs = 0.469; P less than 0.01). Lumbar punctures were performed in 26 patients before and after 3 weeks of NT treatment. During treatment there was a 30.9% mean decrease in the noradrenaline metabolite 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (HMPG) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We could not evaluate the extent to which this decrease was caused by NT or 10-OH-NT, respectively, because both are strong inhibitors of noradrenaline uptake. The ratio between the concentration of NT and 10-OH-NT in CSF correlated to the reduction of HMPG in CSF (r = 0.397; P less than 0.05) and to the amelioration of depression (rs = 0.623; P less than 0.001). This might indicate that NT and 10-OH-NT interact on the noradrenaline system in a nonadditive way. During treatment there was a 15.2% decrease in CSF concentration of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The reduction was significantly correlated to the CSF concentration of NT but not to that of 10-OH-NT. This is in accordance with the fact that NT is a more potent inhibitor of serotonin uptake than is 10-OH-NT. The dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in CSF decreased significantly by 10.0%. The biochemical data indicate that noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic systems are affected by NT treatment and that 10-OH-NT might be more selective on noradrenergic neurons than the parent drug.\r"

We have previously shown that brief incubations with agonists redistribute (? internalize) most of the beta-adrenergic receptors on mononuclear leukocytes away from the cell surface without changing total receptor number. However, negligible redistribution occurred after exercise or an infusion of isoproterenol. The current study was designed to ask whether receptor redistribution occurs over a longer time course after administration of terbutaline, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist that is known to cause a decrease in receptor number. Normal volunteers were given terbutaline, 5 mg t.i.d. for 6 days. As expected, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors decreased. However, the remaining receptors were not redistributed. Redistribution also did not occur after 1 or 2 days of terbutaline, at which time down regulation was minimal. We also found that terbutaline did not alter the ability of the receptors to be redistributed or desensitized by a preincubation with isoproterenol.\r"

A 15 mg/kg dose of NAPA was administered and a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was used to relate plasma NAPA concentrations to changes in corrected QT interval (QTc). NAPA volume of distribution, elimination clearance, and elimination half-life averaged 1.37 +/- 0.19 L/kg, 174 +/- 63 ml/min, and 8.2 +/- 1.4 hours, respectively (mean +/- SD), and NAPA renal clearance averaged 1.9 +/- 0.6 times creatinine clearance. QTc prolongation was characterized by a linear-effect model in the first four patients and averaged 2.4 msec for every microgram per milliliter NAPA in a hypothetic biophase. QTc prolongation in patient 5 was exaggerated and was analyzed with an Emax model. Nonetheless, NAPA did not control this patient's arrhythmia. Conversely, patient 1 subsequently developed torsade de pointes even though QTc prolongation in this patient was comparable to that in patients 2 through 4, who responded satisfactorily to NAPA. We conclude that QT interval changes during initial NAPA administration do not reliably predict subsequent clinical response.\r"

No significant differences (median [range]; fasting vs. fed) in procainamide lag time (0.5 [0.5 to 1.0] vs. 0.5 [0.5 to 1.5] hours) or time at which peak procainamide plasma concentrations occurred (2.9 [1.0 to 4.3] vs. 2.8 [2.0 to 6.0] hours) were evident with feeding.

Each of 15 male volunteers received a single oral 10 mg dose with 120 ml water under three conditions: fasting, after a low-fat (high-carbohydrate) meal, and after a high-fat meal. An open, three-way Latin-square design was employed with a 4-day washout period between administrations. Serial blood samples were collected just before the dose (0 hour) and from 0 to 8 hours after administration. Nifedipine assays were performed by GLC/electron capture detection. Diet did not appreciably alter the AUC from 0 to 8 hours, the AUC from 0 to infinity, or the elimination half-life. The time to peak (tmax) and peak concentrations (Cmax) were significantly altered by food. The mean Cmax values for fasting, low-fat, and high-fat meals were 78.9, 42.2, and 58.7 ng/ml, respectively. The mean tmax values for these three conditions were 0.97, 1.89, and 1.07 hours, respectively. The results indicate that food, in particular a low-fat (high-carbohydrate) meal, slows the rate but does not alter the extent of nifedipine absorption. Insofar as certain side effects (e.g., flushing and headache) may be related to the high peak plasma levels associated with rapid absorption, administration with meals might serve to reduce the incidence of such effects. Clinical trials would be necessary to confirm this possibility. For the majority of patients on routine maintenance therapeutic regimens, nifedipine capsules may be administered without regard to food intake.\r"

Intravenous administration of medroxalol, 2 mg/kg, to 10 hypertensive subjects resulted in significant elevation of mean prolactin levels above basal levels at all time intervals measured from 30 to 240 minutes after injection. Oral medroxalol administration to 11 hypertensive subjects for up to 15 months did not alter mean prolactin levels. Medroxalol neither stimulated prolactin release nor decreased dopamine suppression of prolactin release from pituitary cell cultures. In conclusion, intravenous medroxalol stimulates prolactin secretion in both normal and hypertensive subjects. This effect is not likely mediated by a direct action of the drug on the pituitary but rather by an effect either within the central nervous system or of a drug metabolite.\r"

To assess any effect of end-stage renal failure on sulindac biotransformation, six patients were given 200 mg sulindac orally. Plasma was sampled over 24 hours. Protein binding of sulindac and metabolites was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Results were compared with historic controls. AUC(0-12) for sulindac and the sulfone were similar to controls. AUC(0-12) for the sulfide was significantly reduced to 4.85 micrograms X hr/ml from 13.1 micrograms X hr/ml (P less than 0.02). Protein binding of all three compounds was significantly reduced by renal failure. When corrected for protein binding, the AUC(0-12) for sulindac and the sulfone was twice that of controls whereas that of the sulfide was 42 ng X hr/ml compared with 83 ng X hr/ml in normal individuals (P less than 0.001). This suggests that end-stage renal failure impairs the reduction of sulindac to the active sulfide whereas oxidation to the sulfone is intact.\r"

In a stratified, randomized, parallel, double-blind trial, 120 hospitalized women with moderate or severe postpartum uterine pain were treated with single oral doses of anirolac, 50 or 100 mg, naproxen sodium, 550 mg, or placebo. Using verbal scales, patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and side effects at regular intervals for 6 hours. Highest summed analgesic ratings over placebo were induced by anirolac, 100 mg (P less than or equal to 0.001), and naproxen (P less than or equal to 0.001), followed by anirolac, 50 mg (P less than or equal to 0.005). At each assessment after the first hour, anirolac, 50 and 100 mg, and naproxen induced significantly stronger analgesia than did placebo. Statistically significantly more drowsiness was reported with all three active agents than with placebo. Our results suggest that, for postpartum uterine pain, analgesia with anirolac, 50 or 100 mg, is equivalent to that with naproxen, 550 mg.\r"

To determine whether genetic constitution is a primary determinant in the expression of such metabolism, four extended Japanese families containing 13 sets of parent/offspring relationships were phenotyped for their mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation activity using the 8-hour urinary ratio of unchanged R- and S-mephenytoin as the trait measurement. The incidence of the poor metabolizer phenotype in these families was 2.2 times greater than that in an unrelated Japanese population. In three families in which both parents were poor metabolizers of mephenytoin, all six children also exhibited the poor metabolizer trait. The phenotype distribution for each family studied was consistent with the hypothesis that mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation activity is under diallelic, monogenic control, with the poor metabolizer phenotype being the autosomal recessive homozygous genotype and the extensive metabolizer phenotype including both the autosomal dominant and heterozygous genotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in two-kidney, one-clip renal vascular hypertensive rats (GHR) to assess the responses of each kidney to acute treatment with the antihypertensive calcium channel blocking agent verapamil in the presence and in the absence of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI). One group of GHR (0.2 mm inner diam. clip 3 weeks before study) were examined during a control period, and during a second period of infusion of verapamil (600 micrograms h-1 kg-1). A second group of GHR were examined during a control period, during CEI (teprotide, 3 mg h-1 kg-1) infusion and during a third period of verapamil (600 micrograms h-1 kg-1) infusion superimposed on CEI infusion. Although systemic blood pressure (BP) decreased from 175 +/- 4 to 149 +/- 5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) in response to verapamil alone, renal blood flow for non-clipped kidneys increased from 5.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.5 +/- 0.3 ml/min, indicating a 30% reduction of renal vascular resistance (P values less than or equal to 0.01; n = 9). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for non-clipped kidneys (n = 24) increased from 0.91 +/- 0.09 to 1.47 +/- 0.14 ml/min and filtration fraction increased from 0.32 +/- 0.04 to 0.47 +/- 0.03 (P values less than or equal to 0.05). Urine flow rate and absolute and fractional sodium excretion for non-clipped kidneys increased. GFR for clipped kidneys decreased during verapamil. Treatment with CEI alone resulted in nearly identical responses of BP and function of the non-clipped kidney, except filtration fraction was unchanged. The addition of verapamil to ongoing converting enzyme blockade tended to augment the increased GFR of the non-clipped kidney. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 30 +/- 3 to 59 +/- 7 ng of angiotensin (ANG) I h-1 ml-1 with verapamil alone, a significantly larger increment than the increase of PRA from 27 +/- 5 to 39 +/- 9 ng of ANG I h-1 ml-1 in GHR subjected to comparable blood pressure reduction by mechanical aortic constriction. Verapamil resulted in many similar effects on renal function to those observed during blockade of converting enzyme. The increased filtration fraction observed in response to verapamil may be the result of vasodilatation of the afferent arteriole or of an increase in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient.\r"

During the exercises, ventilation was recorded and patients recorded their sensation of breathlessness on a visual analogue scale (VAS) every 30 s. Breathing supplemental oxygen produced a small fall in mean exercise ventilation and a large and consistent reduction in mean exercise breathlessness. In seven patients the VAS scores were higher on air than with supplemental oxygen, at similar levels of ventilation. An analysis of covariance, to control for reduction in ventilation, showed a decrease in mean breathlessness when breathing supplemental oxygen, significant at the 8% level. The reduction in breathlessness produced by preventing exercise desaturation cannot be explained by the decrease in ventilation. This suggests that hypoxia may be a stimulus for breathlessness. The mechanism is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The transport of 5-fluorouracil, uracil and thymine has been studied with isolated jejunal loops of rat small intestine. High performance liquid chromatography was used to identify the pyrimidines and measure their concentrations. When the lumen of the intestine was perfused with 5-fluorouracil or uracil at 0.1 mmol/l or 0.2 mmol/l, the concentration in the serosal secretions was significantly higher than that in the lumen. For thymine the serosal concentration exceeded that in the lumen only at 0.1 mmol/l. Analysis of the mucosal tissue water at the end of the perfusion demonstrated that when the intestinal lumen was perfused with any one of the three pyrimidines at 0.1 mmol/l or 0.2 mmol/l the concentration within the tissue was significantly above that in the lumen. After an initial lag period linear rates of transport from the lumen to the serosal secretions were obtained for all three pyrimidines over a 10-fold concentration range from 0.1 mmol/l to 1 mmol/l. Uracil and thymine inhibited the transmural transport of 5-fluorouracil. The transport of 5-fluorouracil was also studied with a vascularly perfused preparation of rat small intestine. At 0.1 mmol/l the rate of transmural transport of the drug in this preparation was substantially higher than in the jejunal loops. This difference was eliminated by adding 5-fluorouracil to the vascular perfusate, suggesting that the higher transport rate in the vascularly perfused preparation was due to the lower serosal drug concentrations in the mesenteric circulation of the perfused intestine. At a concentration of 5 mmol/l 5-fluorouracil inhibited water transport in the isolated loops and transmural D-galactose transport in the vascular perfusions.\r"

Plasma CBG concentrations were monitored also in 10 women with essential or renovascular hypertension. Plasma albumin, cortisol and oestriol were measured concurrently. Plasma CBG increased two and a half to three times during pregnancy. In those women who developed hypertension in pregnancy (mean arterial pressure greater than 107 mmHg), the plasma CBG concentrations were significantly lower than in those who remained normotensive. In women who developed hypertension, the CBG either failed to increase at the same rate as in normal pregnancies or the level fell before the appearance of hypertension. The earlier the onset of hypertension, the greater the decline in CBG. In all subjects, the CBG concentration at 34-36 weeks gestation was directly related to the birthweight of the infant. Plasma cortisol levels were depressed in hypertension relative to that in the normotensive women. Whilst plasma albumin levels decreased at least 30% in most women during pregnancy, the fall tended to be less in hypertensive women, but there was marked overlap between patient groups. Plasma oestriol concentrations were depressed only in the very severely affected cases. It is suggested the CBG concentration is a further reflection of the metabolic abnormalities associated with hypertension in pregnancy, and that it can be used as a marker to identify and monitor those patients at risk.\r"

The serum TSH profile was characterized by a maximal peak occurring at 23.00 hours and higher nocturnal than diurnal values. Superimposed on this are short term oscillations in serum TSH levels, typical of an ultradian rhythm. The maximal peak in TSH, occurring at 23.00 hours, was abolished by dopamine infused at a rate of 1 microgram min-1 kg-1, and was unaffected by the lower rate of dopamine infusion (0.1 microgram min-1 kg-1). The serum prolactin profile was characterized by a peak occurring soon after the onset of sleep (23.30-00.30 hours), which fell during the morning, and began to rise in late evening. Low dose dopamine (0.1 microgram min-1 kg-1) had a slight but insignificant effect with decreased prolactin levels at the end of the infusion whereas the higher dopamine dose was associated with significantly lower prolactin levels during and throughout the infusion. There was a rebound to levels significantly higher than control on cessation of the infusion. Cortisol levels were unaffected by dopamine.\r"

EE was measured for 24 h in ten mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients (average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 23) to determine EE, resting EE, and the energy expended during various ICU activities. Although activities, such as weighing the patient on a sling-type bed scale, repositioning, and chest physiotherapy resulted in dramatic EE increases above resting levels (36%, 31%, and 20%, respectively), the actual contribution of these activities to total EE was small (1.1%, 2.1%, and 3.6%, respectively). The mean measured resting EE was 47.3 +/- 22.3% above mean predicted EE based on the Harris and Benedict equation, and the mean total 24-h EE was 6.9 +/- 2.6(SD)% above the mean measured resting EE. In this group of mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, an activity factor of no greater than 10% above resting EE is appropriate.\r"

Early acute pericarditis (EAP) was clinically recognized in 19 (41%) patients. Pericardial effusion (PE) was detected in 29 (63%) patients. In 23 (50%) patients both anterior and posterior PE was observed, while in six (13%) patients PE was only posterior. An echocardiographic pattern consistent with localized fibrinous pericarditis was detected in 11 (24%) patients. Eighteen (95%) of 19 patients with EAP had PE, and only 11 (40%) of the patients without EAP had PE (p less than .001). We conclude that PE is observed frequently after AMI and that the echocardiographic study can help in the diagnosis of EAP after AMI.\r"

A modification of Simpson's rule was used to measure angiographic volumes, and a new pulmonary artery catheter equipped with a rapid response thermistor was used to measure the ejection fraction by the Holt plateau method. The correlation between the two methods was acceptable (r = 0.83 for RVEF, r = 0.71 for RVEDV) despite the limitations of both angiography and thermodilution. Thermodilution underestimated RVEF and overestimated RVEDV when compared to angiography. The variation coefficient with thermodilution for five measurements of the RVEF per patient was 12 +/- 5%. In addition to pressure and cardiac output measurements, monitoring of RVEF and RVEDV in the ICU should be possible with such a catheter. Further work is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these added data and their use for optimizing the therapy of right ventricular failure in acutely ill patients.\r"

By the third hour and thereafter, the DMSO group had a significantly (p less than .05) higher cardiac output (1.65 +/- 0.08 L/min) than the control group (1.15 +/- 0.10 L/min). The cardiac output increase at 3 h was accompanied by significantly (p less than .05) lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the DMSO group (5315 +/- 248 dyne X sec/cm5) as compared to the control group (7892 +/- 442 dyne X sec/cm5). There were no significant differences in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, or cerebral or pulmonary resistances in the control as compared to the DMSO group. Higher CBF values were noted at one hour and thereafter in the DMSO as compared to the control group (p less than .05). Low-dose DMSO given as an iv bolus improved cardiac output and CBF and lowered SVR in this canine model of experimental myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The improvement in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during CPR after epinephrine administration has been attributed to epinephrine's alpha-adrenergic properties. Methoxamine, a pure alpha-1 agonist, has only been shown to be comparable to epinephrine in restoring circulation after cardiac arrest in a canine model. This study compares the effectiveness of equipotent doses of epinephrine and methoxamine in improving CBF during CPR after a prolonged cardiac arrest in a swine model. Twenty-five swine, weighing 15.9 to 28.2 kg, underwent instrumentation for regional CBF using tracer microspheres. CBF was determined during normal sinus rhythm. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was begun with a pneumatic compressor. CBF measurements were again made during CPR. After 3 min of CPR, the swine were randomized to receive 0.02 or 0.2 mg/kg epinephrine, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mg/kg methoxamine. Five swine were allocated to each group. CBF measurements were determined after drug administration and compared using a Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure. A p-value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. This study demonstrated that, after a 10-min cardiac arrest, CBF was extremely low, averaging less than 7 ml/min X 100 g during external CPR. There were no clinically significant improvements in regional CBF after 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, or the two lowest doses of methoxamine. The addition of 10 mg/kg of methoxamine clinically improved blood flow only to the most caudal CNS structures, including the pons, medulla, and cervical spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary alveolar type-2 cells and subcellular organelles from rabbit lung were morphometrically examined by electron microscopy. The volume and surface densities of lamellar bodies in alveolar type-2 cells from the animals ventilated with HFO-IMV were decreased significantly compared with those from the animals either ventilated with CMV or breathing spontaneously (control group). The cell surface to volume ratio in the HFO-IMV group showed a significant increase compared with the CMV groups, whereas other variables showed no differences between the three groups. These results suggest that the secretion of surfactant from alveolar type-2 cells was enhanced in HFO-IMV-treated animals compared with CMV-treated and control groups.\r"

The chart permits plotting shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt) and efficiency (E or 1--Qsp/Qt) vs. load (L). L is the volume of oxygen (combined and dissolved) that would be exchanged in the lung per minute, if venous blood became fully equilibrated with alveolar gas. L relates cardiac output (Qt), hemoglobin concentration, alveolar oxygen tension, venous oxygen saturation and tension, and the oxygen-hemoglobin combining and oxygen solubility constants. Oxygen consumption (VO2) isopleths are added to the sheet (VO2 = L X E). Qt, VO2, and hence L are indexed per m2 (body surface area), and the approximate normal VO2 range is indicated. Using this sheet hopefully simplifies the correlation of complex pulmonary oxygen exchange data and enhances information recognition and analysis. It provides special help in determining the optimal PEEP in difficult ARI cases. To illustrate its use, a case is detailed.\r"

Mean duration of the inhalation was 34.9 months; mean frequency was 3.2 times per week. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) consisted of flow studies, lung volumes, single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Dsb), airway resistance and airway conductance. An exercise provocation was followed by repetition of the PFT, except for Dsb. Our results revealed an obstructive ventilatory pattern in 90 percent of the subjects. In seven patients, there was a significant increase of airway resistance prior to exercise. In five of the ten patients, exercise provocation produced an increase in residual volume. Five of six subjects receiving a trial of a bronchodilator had significant improvement of obstruction. These findings suggest that intentional inhalation of spray paint may produce abnormalities in pulmonary function. These abnormalities may improve after use of a bronchodilator.\r"

The procedure uses a double-balloon airway-sampling catheter that is placed into the airways with fiberoptic bronchoscopic guidance. A protocol using this technique was attempted in 32 subjects (18 normal subjects and 14 subjects with mild asthma), and 27 of the subjects were able to complete all phases of the protocol, including bronchoalveolar lavage and lavage of an isolated airway segment. There was no significant complication in any subject. Cellular composition of the lavages demonstrated differences in cell differential and total cell counts for the two different sampled regions (central airway vs alveolar spaces). We believe that this technique of lavage of an isolated airway segment is safe and has potential usefulness in many areas of pulmonary research.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of transesophageal rapid atrial pacing with a \"pill-electrode\" for the termination of atrial flutter, we studied 14 consecutive unselected patients presenting with atrial flutter of various etiologies. The bipolar pill-electrode (interelectrode distance 13 mm) was introduced orally without sedation. Of 14 pacing attempts, atrial capture was obtained in 13 (93 percent), and sustained alteration in rhythm (atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm or type 2 flutter) in 12 (86 percent). Normal sinus rhythm occurred in six (43 percent), in all of whom it was preceded by transient atrial fibrillation. There was no difference in baseline flutter rates, pacing rates for atrial capture, or duration of flutter between patients reverting to sinus rhythm and those remaining in flutter or converting to atrial fibrillation. Pacing was well tolerated in all but one subject. Thus, esophageal pacing with the pill-electrode was simple to perform, well-tolerated and highly successful for atrial capture in patients with atrial flutter. Although it had a lower success rate than DC cardioversion in producing sinus rhythm, the simplicity of application makes it a useful initial alternative, particularly in patients in whom cardioversion may be hazardous.\r"

The six patients had a pericardial rub, fever, anemia, leukocytosis, and increasing sedimentation rate; four had a pericardial effusion; two had a pleural effusion. One patient, with coexisting heart disease, died after another episode of pulmonary embolism; in the other five, oral corticosteroids induced complete remission of the pericardial syndrome.

  ".W": "Survival in severe left ventricular failure is poor but has not been widely assessed since the introduction of several new nonglycosidic, nonsympathomimetic oral inotropic agents for long-term therapy. We examined retrospectively the survival of 82 patients with severe left heart failure during long-term treatment with oral milrinone (17 patients), posicor (12 patients), enoximone (47 patients), and piroximone (6 patients). Sixty-five patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 4, 15 patients were in class 3, and two patients were in class 2. There were 57 patients with ischemic and 25 patients were in class 2. There were 57 patients with ischemic and 25 patients with nonischemic etiology of left heart failure. Most patients were referred for inotropic therapy after failing to respond to conventional agents, including vasodilators. However, in almost all patients, marked hemodynamic and clinical improvement occurred initially. Overall survival was 36 percent at six months, the majority of deaths occurring during the first three months. Survival in relation to etiology of heart failure showed a trend toward increased mortality in patients associated with ischemic heart disease vs non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Sudden death mortality was also higher in the ischemic group (28 percent at six months vs 5 percent at six months; p less than 0.05). There was a trend toward reduced sudden death mortality in patients on antiarrhythmic agents during inotropic therapy (p = 0.06). We conclude that overall survival in symptomatic patients with severe left ventricular failure remains very low during long-term therapy with several new oral inotropic agents. Sudden death appears higher in patients with an ischemic etiology during therapy with these agents.\r"

Patients receiving streptokinase in the prehospital phase of acute myocardial infarction had smaller infarcts and better residual myocardial function than the group given streptokinase inhospital in terms of peak creatinine phosphokinase, ejection fraction, computer-derived dysfunction index, and electrocardiographic QRS score. The only difference between these groups at baseline was the duration of pain prior to initiation of streptokinase therapy. There were no major complications related to prehospital administration of streptokinase.\r"

The five isolated papillomas had verrucous appearances. The common opinion, that the solitary papilloma is likely to be a pedunculary tumor, seems untrue. Squamous or cylindric epithelium covering the same tumor may vary from region to region. We believe that multiple polyps caused by inhalation of hot, burning, and corrosive gases are of inflammatory origin. Once the causative factor (eg, a late diagnosed foreign body) is removed, the inflammatory papillomatosis may resolve spontaneously. After the removal of a benign papilloma, recurrence is usually caused by lack of operative radicality rather than by malignancy. Laser technique and other coagulation methods make it possible to remove most tumors by performing bronchoscopy with only little risk. Papillomas showing the signs of atypia and peribronchial spreading require later surgery.\r"

Five patients had a good outcome, with disappearance of the thrombi following IV heparin therapy, and one patient died.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the role of Doppler ultrasound during exercise for assessment of patients with mitral stenosis. Doppler echocardiography was performed at rest and during symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise in ten patients with isolated mitral stenosis. The mean mitral valvular gradient was calculated using modified Bernoulli's equation, and the mitral valvular area was estimated from the equation, 220/pressure half-time. During exercise the heart rate increased from 74 +/- 14 beats per minute (mean +/- SD) at rest to 110 +/- 8 beats per minute (p less than 0.001) during exercise. The mean mitral gradient increased from 9 +/- 5 mm Hg at rest to 18 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during exercise. The mitral pressure half-time decreased from 225 +/- 62 msec at rest to 190 +/- 42 msec during peak exercise (p less than 0.005). This corresponded to a reduction of 15 percent. The estimated mitral valvular area increased from 1.0 +/- 0.4 sq cm at rest to 1.2 +/- 0.3 sq cm at peak exercise (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, Doppler echocardiography can be used to evaluate patients with mitral stenosis, with the response of the mitral valvular gradient being the index of obstruction; however, caution should be used in applying the mitral pressure half-time for estimation of the mitral valvular area at high heart rates and flows.\r"

Clinicians have utilized various ancillary diagnostic techniques to help with difficult treatment decisions. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the theoretic and experimental potential of differentiating various stages of ILD, we prospectively studied 34 adult patients in a 0.15 Tesla resistive magnet body imager. The most severely affected patients, who were thought to warrant a steroid trial, had the greatest MRI image intensity, and dramatic improvement was seen following successful treatment. Qualitative MRI data were as useful as any other ancillary diagnostic technique (radiographic, physiologic, scintigraphic) in predicting clinical course. Computer-generated relaxation times were not sufficiently precise to differentiate active from inactive disease. Although limited by availability and cost, MRI appears to be a useful ancillary diagnostic technique in ILD patients facing immunomodulating therapy.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-one patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who had hemodynamic studies were evaluated by a scoring system of the seven following noninvasive variables which our laboratory had developed to estimate the severity of AS: left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by ECG; visible aortic valve calcification by chest x-ray examination; loudness of A2; Q to peak of systolic murmur; T-time of the carotid pulse; LV ejection time; and LVH by M-mode echocardiography. The range of the severity score is 0 to 16, and a score greater than or equal to 5 has been shown correctly to identify 93 percent of patients with severe AS (valve area less than or equal to 1.0 cm2). The present study has applied this method to the detection of progression of AS. Eleven patients (mean age, 60.4 years) were studied who had hemodynamic studies performed two to nine years apart (mean, three years). Progression of stenosis occurred in all, with an increase in mean aortic valve gradient from 23 +/- 4.7 mm Hg to 46 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). Aortic valve area decreased from 1.5 +/- 0.18 cm2 to 0.88 +/- 0.10 cm2 (p less than 0.005). Noninvasive scores increased in these patients from 0.7 +/- 0.5 to 7.1 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.005). Thirty-five patients (mean age, 62.4 years) had repeat noninvasive studies one to six years apart (mean 3 years). Twenty-two (63 percent) had an increase in the noninvasive score of greater than or equal to 3 points, and 20 (57 percent) attained a score of greater than or equal to 5, indicating probable severe AS. The mean initial severity score was 2.2 +/- 0.3, and at the end of a mean follow-up of three years, the score was 8.3 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.005). It is concluded that in the elderly male, progression of AS over a three-year period occurs in about 60 percent of patients, and progression can be detected by simple, noninvasive methods.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that the cell populations recovered with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be important in predicting disease progression and response to therapy. We evaluated this hypothesis in 27 patients by determining if the cell populations recovered with BAL differed between patients who improved, remained stable, or worsened in their pulmonary functions (as defined by at least a 15 percent change in forced vital capacity) over a six-month observation period. The findings suggested that BAL eosinophilia may be a marker of progressive lung disease in patients with IPF and PF-CVD.\r"

The impact of the ICU treatment was manifested in a decrease in mortality, from 43.58 percent to 15 percent. In addition, while patients treated conservatively died as a consequence of early acute respiratory failure, the main cause of death in the ICU-treated patients was unexpected cardiac arrest, probably related to overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. We conclude that to ensure a high survival rate in patients with tetanus, the treatment must be performed according to established protocol in an ICU.\r"

  ".W": "Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed as a diagnostic procedure in 91 consecutive patients ultimately proven to have bronchogenic carcinoma. Results of TBNA were compared, in the same patients, to the diagnostic yield of cytologic examination of sputum, endobronchial brushings and washings, and endobronchial/transbronchial biopsy. The diagnostic yield for sputum was 13 percent (10 of 75); brushings, 40 percent (34 of 84); washings, 29 percent (26 of 89); biopsy, 56 percent (42 of 75); and TBNA, 45 percent (41 of 91). Aspirates were positive in 35 percent of patients with adenocarcinoma, 41 percent with squamous cell carcinoma, 52 percent with large cell undifferentiated carcinoma, and 55 percent of patients with small cell carcinoma. Carinal aspirates were positive in 54 percent (6 of 11); paratracheal aspirates, 57 percent (13 of 23); parabronchial aspirates, 39 percent (11 of 28); endobronchial, 78 percent (7 of 9), and peripheral mass or solitary pulmonary nodule, 40 percent (17 of 42). The overall diagnostic yield for brushings, washings, and biopsy was 64 percent. The addition of TBNA increased the yield to 71 percent. Bronchogenic carcinoma was diagnosed solely by TBNA in six patients, all with extrabronchial or extratracheal lesions. We conclude that TBNA increases the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy, particularly in patients with extratracheal and extrabronchial lesions. An equally important observation is that TBNA fails to contribute significantly to the diagnosis of cancer in patients with lesions readily accessible by conventional bronchoscopic techniques. Exceptions to this observation include occasional patients with necrotic endobronchial tumors, submucosal lesions, and rarely patients with peripheral lung nodules or masses.\r"

Although in vivo therapy with BRM or adoptive immunotherapy with BRM-treated cells seems logical in the treatment of bronchogenic carcinoma, recent studies have shown that lymphocytes from the lung and tumor tissues of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma have defective cytotoxic function. We sought to determine if defects in lung cytotoxic cell function are primary or secondary to local tumor effects, and if peripheral blood lymphocyte populations from patients can serve as a source for BRM-stimulated cytotoxic cells. We evaluated the natural killer (NK) cell and lymphokine (Il-2) activated killer cell activity (LAK) activity of mononuclear cell populations from 11 patients with newly diagnosed bronchogenic carcinoma and three control groups. Cultured human squamous cell and adenocarcinoma cell lines proved useful in evaluating LAK activity in these studies. Levels of NK and LAK activity in patients compared favorably with both those of non-smokers in two different age ranges and with smokers. Peripheral blood cytotoxic cell function remains intact and responsive to augmentation by BRM in patients with recently diagnosed bronchogenic carcinoma. Reported defects in patient lung cell cytotoxic function appear to be local tumor-related defects not present in peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

CT played an important role in establishing the early diagnosis of IPA and affected management. Since our original communication describing the CT findings of IPA, we have added ten new cases, each subsequently substantiated by lung biopsy (two), autopsy (two), and/or positive cultures of sputum or extrapulmonary sites (seven). The CT halo sign, or zone of lower attenuation surrounding a pulmonary mass, was present in eight of nine patients with early CT scans obtained during bone marrow aplasia. Characteristic CT progression from multiple fluffy masses to cavitation or air crescent formation suggested IPA in five of seven patients with serial CT scans. CT directly affected patient management in seven of ten cases. Scan findings were one criterion for increasing to high-dose amphotericin B or for adding 5-fluorocytosine. CT characteristics of healing IPA lesions were similar to resolving pulmonary infarcts and were used to monitor disease activity in patients on long-term amphotericin B and prior to retreatment chemotherapy.\r"

The spleen has been measured in 116 patients undergoing laparotomy for inflammatory bowel disease--80 Crohn's disease and 36 ulcerative colitis--from 1975 to 1985. Small spleen size, of lesser degree than that of classic splenic atrophy, is associated with presurgery disease complications as well as infective problems after surgery. Spleen size was not related to site or extent of disease, or to recurrence, but the wide range of spleen size seen in inflammatory bowel disease, comparable to that seen in malignancy suggests that more sophisticated tests of splenic function might show a closer correlation with disease patterns.\r"

The ascending colon was filled with saline by retrograde flow, and pressures at which coloileal reflux occurred were recorded. Twelve of 14 ICJ's were competent to pressures of up to 80 mm Hg; two incompetent ICJ's refluxed fluid into the ileum at intracecal pressures of approximately 40 mm Hg. Competent specimens were then restudied. Removal of mucosa at the ileocecal junction (N = 6), or a strip of circular muscle (N = 6), did not impair competence to pressures above 40 mm Hg. However, division of fibrous tissues which helped maintain an angulation between the ileum and cecum (superior and inferior ileocecal ligaments) rendered the junction incompetent in all specimens. In four samples tested, surgical reconstruction of the ileocecal angle restored competence. Comparable observations were made in three anesthetized dogs in vivo. These findings suggest that mechanical factors, maintained by the external anatomy, contribute to competence at the ICJ.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 1578 patients were treated with potentially curative surgical resection for colon and rectal cancer by one surgeon from 1950 to 1982. Follow-up revealed that 117 (11.5 percent) of 1013 patients with rectal carcinoma eventually presented with clinical evidence of pulmonary recurrence, with or without evidence of spread elsewhere; the corresponding figures for the colon were 20 (3.5 percent) of 565 (P less than 0.001). An analysis of the times to recurrence revealed that half of the lung recurrences were clinically obvious within 32 months for rectal tumors and 34 months for colonic, compared to 22 and 21 months, respectively, for liver recurrences, excluding those with other distant metastases. The slower recurrence rate and the longer survival in patients with recurrences in the lung compared to the liver were statistically significant only for rectal primaries (P less than 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively). Sixteen patients underwent surgery with curative intention for lung recurrences; four of these remain alive at two, six, 11, and 15 years, and one patient was free of recurrence when he died from other causes 15 months after surgery. The conditional probability survival rate for the 16 patients was 38 +/- 13 percent at five years after recurrence operation.\r"

A series of 25 patients with polyposis treated at the Mount Sinai Hospital over a period of ten years is reported. The mean age of the patients was 23 years. Early postoperative complications were present in seven patients and consisted of thrombophlebitis (three), pelvic sepsis (three), and retraction of the anastomosis (one). Intestinal obstruction requiring laparotomy occurred in another five patients. Twenty-three patients were followed for a mean of 47 months after closure of the ileostomy. Ninety-one percent are satisfied with the operative results. The mean number of bowel movements per 24 hours is 6.0. All patients are continent, but eight have occasional episodes of rectal seepage at night. Nearly 50 percent require some antidiarrheal medication. New adenomatous polyps have developed just above the dentate line in four patients. Patients with polyposis coli seem to have fewer serious complications requiring excision of the ileoanal anastomosis than patients with ulcerative colitis. They also should have lifelong surveillance of the entire gastrointestinal tract even after total colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "Is the observed recurrence rate after curative surgery for rectal cancer always a good measure of therapeutic improvements? In an attempt to answer this question, the rates of local and distant recurrences were studied in two complete series of patients operated on for cure for rectal carcinoma. One hundred one consecutive patients were followed for five years in one series and 231 were followed for at least 18 years in the other series. The recurrence rate in the first series was 39 percent and in the second, with the longer observation time, 54 percent. The local recurrence rates were 24 and 38 percent, respectively. Both local and total recurrence rates increased with the length of the follow-up period. This was especially true for patients with combined local and distant disease. Autopsy sometimes demonstrated recurrences, clinically undiscovered. It is concluded that completeness, long follow-up, and intensive search for recurrence, including a high autopsy rate, are factors that raise both total and local recurrence rates. All these factors are important to consider when comparing results of different treatment modalities.\r"

  ".W": "Routine preoperative colonoscopy has been recommended for those patients with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer to identify synchronous polyps and/or cancers which might otherwise be undetected on barium enema or at the time of operation. It has been suggested that this approach may alter surgical therapy or follow-up. The charts of 98 patients who underwent preoperative colonoscopy solely for the purpose of detecting additional polyps or cancers prior to open surgical resection for colorectal cancer were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had biopsy or barium-enema evidence of colorectal cancer. Patients with familial polyposis or chronic ulcerative colitis were excluded. Synchronous cancers were detected in 7.1 percent of patients, and synchronous neoplastic polyps in 29 percent. Forty-three percent of synchronous cancers and 73 percent of synchronous neoplastic polyps would not have been included in the standard surgical resection for the index cancer if the additional information provided by colonoscopy had not been available. Surgical treatment and/or follow-up were altered in 33 percent of patients as a consequence of the colonoscopic evaluation. Colonoscopy prior to surgery for colorectal carcinoma is highly desirable and may potentially improve long-term survival.\r"

Follow-up ranged from four to seven years (median, 5.5 years). The increased mortality in advanced stage and high-grade lesions was significant. Analysis of DNA content showed that most tumors were aneuploid. No statistically significant effect of DNA content on survival could be demonstrated. Thus, histologic grade and clinical stage seem to be the best predictors of patient outcome in squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus.\r"

Sixty patients entered the trial; 28 were drained and 32 undrained. Three patients in the undrained group died soon after surgery of causes unrelated to their colon anastomoses. There were no other differences in the incidence of postoperative complications in the two groups. When an anastomosis leaked, neither feces nor pus emerged via the drain. It is concluded that while the drains did not increase the incidence of postoperative complications, neither did they accomplish the purpose for which they were inserted. If, in addition, the economic cost of drainage is considered, it would seem that there is no advantage in inserting prophylactic drains after colonic anastomoses and their routine use needs to be reconsidered.\r"

Microscopic examination of the test specimens showed that the epithelial continuity, the characteristic brush border, and the positive mucous reaction to PAS and Alcian blue-Alcian yellow methods were not significantly changed with respect to controls. In some test specimens a remarkable number of mitoses were evident in the crypts. Since this could result from water irrigation stimuli and/or might represent an early manifestation of a restored carcinogenetic process, specific investigations were performed on the 0-acylated sialic acids of the colonic mucins, which have been reported to represent markers of early malignant changes in colorectal epithelial cells. The results did not reveal alterations of the sialomucins in the treated specimens with respect to controls.\r"

The recurrence rate was 69 percent in patients with multiple polyps compared with 54 percent in patients with a single polyp. The location of new polyps was in the same colonic segment in 81 percent of the patients, but not at the same site in the colon where a previous polyp had been removed. The histopathology and size of new polyps compared with the initial polyps showed a significant improvement in histopathology toward more benign polyps (P less than 0.02) and smaller polyps (P less than 0.001). In patients who initially had single adenomatous polyps, new polyp(s) were diagnosed after a mean time of 23 months compared with 13.5 months in patients with two or more adenomatous polyps initially. Patients with atypia in initial polyp(s) developed new polyp(s) after a mean time of 11 months compared with 23 months in patients without atypia. The mean time from a colon with no polyps to the diagnosis of a new adenomatous polyp less than 5 mm in size was 11.5 months, which was a statistically significant shorter time than the 19.4 months observed for the development of polyps 5 mm or larger.\r"

The extent of damage was more severe than seen in the upper digestive tract from acid ingestion. Juxtaposed small bowel and the appendix sustained serosal burns.

In addition, this is the first demonstration of this syndrome using abdominal CT scan. A 22-year-old veteran underwent total proctocolectomy for left-sided ulcerative colitis because of failure of medical therapy. At operation an ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis was constructed. Following operation, the patient developed an intestinal obstruction. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated scant retroperitoneal fatty tissue, massive dilatation of the duodenum proximal to the midline, and tapered narrowing of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta. These findings indicated superior mesenteric artery syndrome: arteriomesenteric obstruction of the duodenum. Based on the experience of this case, the authors believe that compression of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery may be a common but unsuspected cause of prolonged postoperative ileus or early postoperative obstruction following ileal pouch anal anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "Samples of maximally diseased and adjacent macroscopically normal intestine from 52 patients undergoing surgery for Crohn's disease were analyzed for ascorbate content; 26 of the patients had intestinal fistulas and 26 did not. Ascorbate analyses were also performed on samples of normal intestine from ten control patients. Diseased intestine from both groups of patients with Crohn's disease contained significantly more ascorbate than the adjacent macroscopically normal intestine. Their diseased intestine also contained significantly more ascorbate than normal intestine from controls. Whereas diseased intestine from patients without fistulas contained 47 percent more ascorbate than their normal intestine (P less than .001), the diseased intestine from patients with fistulas contained only 23 percent more ascorbate than their normal intestine (P less than .02). Patients with fistulas appear unable to concentrate as much ascorbate in their diseased intestine as patients without fistulas. This difference may be a factor in the pathogenesis of fistula formation in Crohn's disease because of the importance of ascorbate in collagen production.\r"

Of these, 78 were regarded as histologically normal; 13 cases of melanosis coli, 7 cases of intestinal spirochetosis, and 2 cases of collagenous colitis were identified. In no cases was there histologic evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. Histologic abnormality could not be predicted by retrospective analysis of various clinical, hematologic and biochemical data. In individual subjects the microscopic abnormality was present to a varying degree in all biopsies, except in intestinal spirochetosis where patchy distribution occurred in some subjects. It is therefore concluded that significant pathology may be missed without biopsy of the apparently normal colon, but in order to reduce the workload of pathology departments and shorten the duration of the examination two biopsies from the hepatic flexure and sigmoid colon may be adequate.\r"

Major complications included abdominal wall hematoma, perforated abdominal viscus, hemoperitoneum, bleeding from liver biopsy, and respiratory depression. We observed a trend to decreased use of laparoscopy. Ascites of unknown origin and certain specific situations in patients with chronic liver disease remain as major indications for this diagnostic technique.\r"

  ".W": "The unequivocal diagnosis of esophageal chest pain requires the demonstration of simultaneous manometric changes and chest pain. Numerous provocative agents have been used to enhance the diagnostic value of esophageal manometry. Our aims were to: evaluate consecutively a large group of patients with proven noncardiac chest pain and normal baseline manometric studies, using edrophonium chloride, 10 mg, and determine the value of provocative testing in clinical practice. One hundred twenty patients with normal standard baseline esophageal manometries were studied using blinded testing with edrophonium chloride and followed clinically by questionnaire. A positive response of both chest pain and manometric changes was observed in 34%, a negative response in 49%, and an indeterminate response in 17% of patients. Baseline manometric features, including high-amplitude contractions, did not predict the response to edrophonium chloride. Following edrophonium chloride administration, the change in amplitude, duration, and number of repetitive contractions from baseline was significantly greater in positive responders. Edrophonium decreased the velocity of propagated contractions in positive responders (P less than 0.05), but not in nonresponders. Response to edrophonium chloride could not be predicted by patient age, sex, or clinical symptomatology. Seventy percent of patients in both groups had symptoms indistinguishable from ischemic heart disease. After making a specific diagnosis of esophageal chest pain, patients showed a marked clinical improvement, with a significant decrease in physical limitation, emergency room visits, hospital and CCU admissions, and in further cardiac testing. We conclude that provocative testing with edrophonium chloride will make it possible to definitively implicate the esophagus in over 30% of patients with normal baseline manometric findings and noncardiac chest pain.\r"

In 45 patients sPIIIP was also correlated to liver histology; biopsies were scored by two of the authors, without knowledge of diagnosis. Compared to normal controls, sPIIIP concentration was found to be significantly elevated in chronic active hepatitis (CAH) and in cirrhosis, but not in fatty liver. Patients affected by chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) had values of sPIIIP higher than normal in four of 11 cases considered. A close correlation was found between sPIIIP values and histological parameters of inflammation, necrosis, and degeneration, while the relationship between sPIIIP levels and fibrosis was weaker. These data suggest that sPIIIP determination may reflect the extent of inflammatory changes in the liver; but it cannot be considered a reliable index of hepatic fibrosis.\r"

These patients provide an opportunity to examine the relationship between the evolution of the liver disease and the ability to metabolize drugs. We have examined hepatic drug disposition in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis due to HBV infection. Four model drugs were used: two low-extraction capacity-limited drugs (antipyrine and aminopyrine) and two high-extraction flow-limited drugs (ICG and lidocaine). The disposition of the four drugs tested was comparable to that of healthy controls in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, and mild cirrhosis. In patients with severe cirrhosis (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, or large esophageal varices), there was a significant impairment in the aminopyrine breath test (-31%) and in the clearance of antipyrine (-53%), lidocaine (-49%), and ICG (-54%). These results indicate that impairment of drug clearance occurs only late in the evolution of HBV-related chronic liver disease. This is in keeping with the known slow and insidious progression of the disease.\r"

The aim of the present study was to investigate if physiologic changes of noradrenaline would evoke any alterations in gastric acid secretion or in the plasma concentration of some gastrointestinal hormones (gastrin, secretin, PP, PYY, and GIP) known to affect gastric physiology. The results show that basal plasma noradrenaline concentration was 1.8 nM and after infusion with noradrenaline at 0.04 or 0.2 nmol/kg/min plasma levels of 2.5 and 4.4 nM were obtained. No appreciable changes could be found in basal or pentagastrin stimulated acid secretion or in any of the gastrointestinal peptides studied. If the elevated plasma noradrenaline concentration observed in duodenal ulcer patients is a pathogenetic factor; it is probable that it interferes with other variables such as blood flow, bicarbonate secretion, or prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "87246001\r", 
  ".W": "The contribution of the resting anal canal pressure (RAP) and the maximal squeeze pressure (MSP) to the problem of fecal incontinence was assessed by comparing 143 incontinent patients to a control population of 157 healthy subjects. These parameters were determined using a multilumen continuously perfused catheter and a mechanized rapid pull-through technique. In 10 male volunteers both RAP and MSP were determined using catheters that varied from 3 mm to 18 mm in diameter. In the control population, the RAP was significantly lower in females 40 years of age and over as compared to males. MSP values were significantly lower in females at virtually all ages. In women, parity did not correlate with RAP (coefficient = -0.099, P greater than 0.05) and MSP (coefficient = -0.123, P greater than 0.05) and any decrease in pressures was related to aging. Aging in women was associated with a consistent reduction in RAP (coefficient = -0.614, P less than 0.00005) and MSP (coefficient = -0.372, P = 0.0006). In males, there was a similar but less impressive age-related reduction for the RAP (coefficient = -0.333, P = 0.006) but not for the MSP (coefficient = -0.196, P greater than 0.05). Nine percent of the volunteer population were essentially unable to increase the RAP with maximal squeeze efforts. A linear increase in anal pressures was recorded as catheter diameter increased from 3 to 12 mm. Normative data for the RAP and MSP (mean +/- 2 SD) were constructed for each sex on a decade basis and showed a wide range of pressures for each age grouping. In the group with fecal incontinence (FI) 39% of females and 44% of males fell within the \"normal\" range for both the RAP and MSP. For all patients with FI, 41% and 17% had impairment of one or both parameters, respectively. It is concluded that: aging affects the RAP in both sexes but to a greater degree in women. The MSP is related to aging in women only; child bearing has no effect upon these parameters; clinical problems of bowel control can occur when sphincter pressure measurements are within the low \"normal\" range; and recording instrument diameter consistently affects RAP and MSP.\r"

Gastric injury was obtained by electrocoagulation of the fundic or antral mucosa. Duodenal ulceration was induced by cysteamine injection which was accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Both antral electrocoagulation and cysteamine injection were also accompanied by antral dysrhythmia and a transient decrease of the gastric transmural potential difference. Effects of antral electrocoagulation were prevented by selective vagotomy. Since antral dysrhythmia disappeared as soon as the antral or duodenal ulcers became active, ie, within three days and 24 hr respectively, it is suggested that antral dysrhythmia is the result of antroduodenal stimulation and could thus not be assessed as a criterion of active ulceration.\r"

A motility index took into account the amplitude, duration, and frequency of contractions. Neodecortication increased the motility index of the distal colon in the fasting state. However, removal of the cerebral cortex did not affect significantly the colon motor response to a meal. Meal stimulation increased the motility index before and after neodecortication. These findings suggest that resting colonic motor activity is increased after neodecortication, probably through the loss of an inhibitory influence of the central nervous system; and the cerebral cortex is not required for the colon response to a meal in the rat.\r"

The high hepatic extraction of D-sorbitol and the dose-independence of its clearance pointed to a flow-dependent clearance regimen. The renal excretion was taken into account when computing the hepatic clearance. Day-to-day reproducibility of the test was good. No significant difference was found when the hepatic clearance was measured by bolus injection or constant infusion methods. As measured by the bolus injection method, the mean (+/- SD) hepatic clearance in the normal subjects (911 +/- 137 ml/min) was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) than that of the cirrhotics (456 +/- 181 ml/min).\r"

It was fairly severe in a small area of the body drained by the obstructed collateral duct and extended around it, reaching the main pancreatic duct which was partly occluded at this level by periductal fibrosis. Pancreatitis was mild in the left part of the pancreas distally from the incomplete stricture of the main duct. The head and body of the pancreas between the stricture and the duodenum were normal.

After 3 wk of CSII treatment, mean daily blood glucose and HbA1 decreased to mean (+/- SE) values of 129 +/- 6 mg/dl and 8.0 +/- 0.1%, respectively. Plasma free-insulin levels in IDDM patients 30 min before a meal during CSII were significantly higher than those during CIT or in normal controls. Fasting mean plasma IRS levels of the IDDM patients during CSII (7.3 +/- 1.4 pg/ml) were not different from those during CIT (8.4 +/- 1.3 pg/ml) and in normal controls (5.9 +/- 0.8 pg/ml). Arginine elicited a rise in plasma IRS during CIT in all seven IDDM patients during CIT and in the normal controls, with peak values of 18.2 +/- 4.1 and 12.5 +/- 1.8 pg/ml, respectively. However, no significant increase in plasma IRS was observed in all seven IDDM patients during CSII. The integrated values of plasma IRS during the arginine-infusion study of the IDDM patients treated with CIT were significantly higher than those of the normal controls. The increased integrated values of plasma immunoreactive glucagon response to arginine observed during CIT became normalized after CSII. These results suggest that glycemic control with CSII in IDDM patients suppresses the increased plasma IRS response to arginine that occurs during CIT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because metabolic control is assumed to be associated with the probability of developing future complications, race and sex differences in metabolic control were assessed in a group of adolescents. Subjects were 27 Black and 27 White adolescents who were similar in age, age at diagnosis, and social class. Girls did not differ on number of days since their last menses. A 2-by-2 (race-by-sex) analysis of variance revealed that the Black female group had worse HbA1c than each of the other groups (P less than .012). Multivariate analyses of variance were conducted to determine whether the poor metabolic control of the Black girls was associated with pertinent psychosocial variables. The analyses revealed that their poor control was not associated with a deficiency in the girls' knowledge about IDDM, adherence to treatment, self-concept, coping patterns, family functioning, stress, social support, or involvement in the health-care system. If the poor control of the Black girls is not associated with psychosocial deficiencies, biological variables or psychosocial variables not assessed in this study are probably operative.\r"

Other adolescent patients, however, feel overwhelmed and helpless. We developed the self-efficacy for diabetes scale (SED) with a sample of adolescent boys (n = 34) and girls (n = 34) with IDDM. High reliability (internal consistency) and evidence for criterion validity were obtained for this measure, because SED scores predicted metabolic control. In addition, construct validity was established, because SED scores were related to theoretically relevant measures of locus of control and self-esteem. Although they showed similar expectancies for diabetes self-efficacy, girls had significantly positive correlations between their SED scores and metabolic control, whereas boys did not. We offer a new instrument for studying adolescent patient perceptions and physical health.\r"

Indeed, such a technique has been introduced by Isolab (Akron, OH). We tested the validity of the method to determine whether applying the blood to paper and immediately assaying it correlates with the same sample assayed by the usual whole-blood technique, the size of sample applied to paper affects apparent GHb results, time and temperature of storage of the sample paper affect apparent GHb results, and plasma glucose concentration of the sample affects GHb results. The GHb of samples assayed immediately after application to sample paper versus those assayed as whole blood showed very good correlation (r = .93, P less than .001). Volume of the drop of blood applied to paper (25-100 microliters) did not affect results. However, there was a dramatic, temperature-dependent increase in apparent GHb when samples were stored on sample paper, averaging 12.5, 16.3, and 19.5% when stored at room temperature for 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. Overall, apparent GHb rose from 1.3-fold in 3 days at 4 degrees C to 3.8-fold in 9 days at 37 degrees C. The rate of GHb formation was proportional to plasma glucose concentration, but removal of free glucose by ethanol or glucose oxidase did not yield consistent results for this method. We conclude that these sample papers are not useful as an approach to collecting blood samples for GHb measurement.\r"

Within the plasma glucose range of 20-360 mg/dl, there was a close correlation between the results of all three test-strip readings and the values obtained by the reference method (Beckman glucose analyzer): HGT 1/1, r = .950; HGT 1/2 SP, r = .966; and HGT 1/2 SC, r = .966. Absolute deviations from the reference values were 17 +/- 2, 17 +/- 1, and 17 +/- 1 mg/dl (mean +/- SE). Analysis of variance did not reveal any significant differences between the values of each of the three procedures compared with the reference method (P = .98). These results indicate that visual reading of split test strips is as reliable as the reading of original test strips. A special splitting device is not necessary.

Currently there are several HMBGs marketed in the United States, each claiming reliability, accuracy, and \"user friendliness,\" with most of these claims largely unsubstantiated. The objective of our study was to analyze and statistically compare the accuracy and precision of the HMBGs produced by the major competitors in this ever-expanding medical field. Accuracy of each monitor was studied by comparing the glucose value reported by each HMBG with that determined by a reference method (YSI 23A). Precision or reproducibility of results was performed by testing a single, known whole-blood glucose sample 20 times on each monitor. The precision of each device was tested on known low, normal, and elevated samples. Actual and absolute deviations from the reference standard demonstrate that the Accuchek bG and Glucoscan 2000 monitors provide relatively unbiased estimates of blood glucose, whereas the Glucokey, Glucochek II, Glucometer II, and Trendsmeter generally underestimate the true values. The Diascan and Accuchek II monitors, in a separate evaluation, demonstrated acceptable accuracy and precision. We conclude that the Accuchek bG and Glucoscan 2000 statistically are the most accurate and precise HMBGs.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to examine whether the kidney CaBPs (9 kd and 28 kd) are also affected in young Hyp mice and to investigate the ability of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] to increase CaBP in the intestine and kidney. The 28 kd CaBP and the 9 kd CaBP were measured in the kidneys and the 9 kd CaBP in the intestines of normal and Hyp mice from 1 week to 40 weeks of age. At all times between 3 and 6 weeks, intestinal CaBP in Hyp mice was decreased by more than 50% (P less than 0.005-0.001) and no significant decrease was present in the adult Hyp mice (12 and 40 weeks of age). By contrast, both kidney CaBPs were decreased only slightly in young Hyp mice. Between 1 and 6 weeks of age, the 9 kd CaBP in Hyp mice was 82% +/- 4% of control (P less than 0.001) and the 28 kd protein was 89% +/- 3% of control (P less than 0.001). Minipumps containing 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle were implanted in 4-week and 13-week-old Hyp mice for 3 days to provide a dose of 0.12 micrograms/kg mouse X day. The 9 kd CaBP was increased approximately 3-fold (P less than 0.001) by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the intestines of Hyp mice at both ages. The 9 kd kidney CaBP in Hyp mice also was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment at both ages, but only by 33-52%. The 28 kd CaBP in the kidney was not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of Hyp mice at either age. We conclude that (9 kd and 28 kd) CaBPs levels in both intestine and kidney are decreased in juvenile Hyp mice although to much different degrees. The administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to Hyp mice increases the 9 kd CaBP in both intestine and kidneys, whereas the renal 28 kd CaBP is unaffected.\r"

  ".W": "Selective regulation of estrogen receptor (ER) content, distribution, and function has been studied in mouse mammary gland, as influenced by PRL and estradiol administration in vivo. In virgin female C3H+ mice, short-term treatment with PRL causes an apparent increase in the affinity with which activated ER binds to DNA. However, a contrasting effect of PRL to diminish nuclear accumulation of ER and progesterone receptors is consistently observed in PRL-treated mice. The ER-enhancing activity of PRL and the PRL mediation of estrogen stimulation of ER are more pronounced in C3H than in BALB/c mammary tissue, evidenced by the ability of bromocryptine (CB-154) to eradicate estrogen-stimulated appearance of ER in C3H, while having no effect on this parameter in the BALB/c animal. Uterine ER in either strain is independent of PRL and is stimulated with equivalent efficiency by estradiol. Stimulation of mammary gland ER activity by estradiol is dose responsive, being linear within the range of 0.25-5.0 micrograms/kg body weight. The simultaneous rise in cytosolic progesterone receptor binding activity is also linear over the same range. With respect to PRL responsiveness, ovariectomized adult (but not immature) mouse tissue shows a doubling of ER content with 10(3) or 10(4) micrograms/kg body weight, but no elevation with 10(2) or lower levels. The upper level is approximately equivalent to that seen in the intact or estrogen-replaced castrate mouse. High levels of PRL administered to these latter animal groups cause a secondary increase in ER activity. A PRL-independent component of estradiol-stimulated ER activity is demonstrable from experiments using various doses of CB-154 in animals treated with different levels of estradiol. High dosages of CB-154 superimposed on a highly inducing level of estradiol have a side effect of redistributing nuclear ER to the cytosol; sucrose gradient analyses of nuclear receptor levels demonstrate that this pharmacological action of CB-154 is not mediated through its PRL-suppressive effect. The suppression of nuclear ER by CB-154 is reflected in a loss of estrogen-induced progesterone receptor activity. The ability of tamoxifen to inhibit estrogen-stimulated progesterone receptor activity is appreciably curtailed by concomitant treatment with PRL. These results demonstrate that, of PRL and estradiol, PRL is the dominant factor in eliciting ER activity in mouse mammary gland. Basal conditions are established for quantifying the relative contributions of these and other modifiers of mammary tissue function at the molecular level, and for uncovering otherwise-masked differential dose-related effects of such agents.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were undertaken to delineate the role of sialic acid residues in the two subunits of hCG in relation to its hormonal activity. Sialic acid was removed by treatment of the individual subunits or intact hCG with insolubilized neuraminidase. Desialylated variants of hCG were obtained by combining an asialo subunit (as alpha or as beta) with its complementary intact or desialylated subunit. When tested in the hCG receptor assay using a rat testis fraction, none of the hCG variants exhibited any loss of activity compared with that of intact purified hCG. In in vitro bioassays that employed cAMP and testosterone generation in rat Leydig cells as indices of response, intact hCG and as alpha in combination with intact beta (as alpha-beta) were equipotent. In contrast, intact alpha-subunit combined with as beta (alpha-as beta) and desialylated intact hCG (asialo-hCG) showed activity that at the highest concentration of each tested (20 ng/ml) was no more than half of that evoked by intact hCG. In a TSH receptor assay in human thyroid membranes, loss of sialic acid from either one or both hCG subunits resulted in enhancement of binding affinity; the rank order of decreasing potency was asialo-hCG, alpha-as beta, as alpha-beta. However, despite their enhanced binding affinity, and like intact hCG itself, none of the variants elicited a cAMP response in either human thyroid membranes or cultured human thyroid cells. Rather, asialo-hCG and alpha-as beta, but not intact hCG and as alpha-beta, were effective antagonists of the stimulatory response induced by bovine TSH in thyroid cells. These findings indicate that desialylation of hCG enhances its binding affinity for hCG receptors in testis and, much more so, for TSH receptors in human thyroid. Desialylation also changes hCG from a full agonist to a partial agonist in testis and from a nonagonist to an antagonist in human thyroid. In all cases, sialic acid in the beta-subunit of hCG appears to have a predominant role in these effects.\r"

  ".U": "87246355\r", 
  ".W": "Cultured dog thyroid cells contain 21 and 19 kilodalton (K) phosphoproteins which by several criteria have been identified as light chains of myosin (MLC). TSH causes a reduction in the phosphorylation state of the 21 K-19 K proteins, at least in part through activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cAMP levels. We now report that 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also decreases the 21 K-19 K protein phosphorylation state, but in contrast to that due to TSH, the TPA-induced decrease is not associated with elevated cAMP levels. The effect of TPA was not additive to that of TSH. Because Ca++ is a major factor regulating MLC kinase and TPA-stimulated protein kinase C in other systems, the role of Ca++ in the phosphorylation of the 21 and 19 K polypeptides in dog thyroid was examined. In intact cells, both (8-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8) (1 X 10(-4) M) and trifluoperazine (TFP) (4 X 10(-5) M) increase basal 21 K-19 K protein phosphorylation and inhibit the decrease in phosphorylation caused by TSH and TPA without affecting cAMP levels. Ionophore A23187 (5 X 10(-6) M) counteracts TMB-8- and TFP-stimulated phosphorylation as well as TMB-8 and TFP inhibition of TSH- and TPA-reduced 21 K-19 K phosphorylation. Incubation of 32PO4-labeled dog thyroid cells in the absence of extracellular Ca++ or with verapamil does not significantly affect basally phosphorylated 21 K-19 K proteins or the decreased 21 K-19 K phosphorylation state caused by TSH. These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation state of the 21 and 19 K proteins is affected more significantly by intracellular Ca++ pools than by extracellular Ca++, and implicate a kinase(s) other than Ca++-calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase in the phosphorylation of MLC in the dog thyroid.\r"

  ".W": "The locus of gonadotropin-induced acute stimulation of pregnenolone production by cholesterol side-chain cleavage (CSCC) enzyme containing cytochrome P450 (cytP450scc) was examined in rat corpus luteum. Mitochondria were isolated from pseudopregnant rat ovaries after treatment with different doses of human CG (hCG) (25-200 IU) for 30 min; Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra of high spin cholesterol complex of cyt P450scc (type I high spin EPR signal) and the cyt P450scc activity were determined. hCG treatment increased the formation of type I EPR spectra compared to that obtained with saline-treated controls, and pretreatment with cycloheximide (30 mg/kg BW) before hCG abolished this increase. The magnitude of type I EPR signal diminished with increasing pH over the range of 6.2-7.3. The type I EPR signal increased with doses of hCG and correlated well with the pregnenolone production. Aminoglutethimide treatment (competitive inhibitor of CSCC) before hCG injection led to an increased accumulation of cholesterol in inner mitochondrial membranes with a corresponding decrease in the outer membrane cholesterol, and cycloheximide treatment inhibited this accumulation. This suggests that the transport of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membranes from outer membranes is regulated by hCG. In addition, gonadotropin also regulates the redistribution of cholesterol within the inner mitochondrial membranes.\r"

  ".U": "87246368\r", 
  ".W": "It has recently been shown that wavelengths in the near-UV range (UV-A, 320-400 nm) are capable of influencing pineal melatonin content in the hamster. The purpose of this study was to compare the capacities of monochromatic visible and UV radiation for suppressing nocturnal pineal melatonin. Groups of male Syrian hamsters adapted to a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle (lights on, 1700-0700 h) were exposed to irradiances of 500 or 360 nm light for 5 min during their dark phase. Both wavelengths suppressed pineal melatonin in a dose-related manner. The resultant fluence-response curves were similar in shape, although their corresponding threshold irradiances were markedly different. The calculated ED50 values for 500 and 360 nm light were 0.022 microW/cm2 (1.66 X 10(13) photons/cm2) and 0.306 microW/cm2 (1.66 X 10(14) photons/cm2), respectively. These data show that the induction of a 50% depression of pineal melatonin requires 10 times the number of 360-nm photons compared to 500-nm photons at the level of the cornea. Despite this difference in sensitivity to wavelength, environmental irradiances of UV-A are well above the threshold for melatonin suppression in the hamster. These results thus demonstrate the importance of considering UV-A, in addition to the visible wavelengths, in the regulation of hamster pineal physiology.\r"

  ".U": "87246370\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP) and active calcium (Ca) transport in the small intestine of vitamin D-replete lactating rats are regulated by dietary Ca intake, pregnant rats were given a high Ca (1.6% Ca and 1.4% phosphorus) or low Ca (0.1% Ca and 0.4% phosphorus) diet starting 3 days before delivery. Toward the end of lactation (days 16-23) the rats were killed, and active Ca transport (using everted gut sacs) and CaBP were determined in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The right tibiae were used for bone weight and ash determinations. The Ca transport ratios and CaBP concentrations in jejunum and ileum were significantly increased only in the low Ca group. In contrast, in the duodenum both parameters were equally high regardless of the diet. Nonlactating rats given the two diets for the same length of time had the expected increase in both parameters in the duodenum when fed the low Ca diet. Nonlactating rats, in contrast to lactating rats, had undetectable CaBP in jejunum and ileum regardless of diet. Lactating rats fed the high Ca diet had no net loss of bone at the end of lactation compared with rats on day 1 of lactation. In contrast, lactating rats fed the low Ca diet had a net loss of 44% of bone weight. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] concentrations on the 21st day of lactation were (mean +/- SE) 538 +/- 96 and 46 +/- 18 pg/ml in rats consuming the low and high Ca diets, respectively. The comparable values for the nonlactating rats were 140 +/- 4 and 26 +/- 8 pg/ml. In conclusion, dietary Ca restriction during lactation can stimulate CaBP and active Ca transport in both jejunum and ileum, and both parameters appear to be modulated by dietary Ca via the circulating concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, in the duodenum neither parameter appears to be related to dietary Ca, plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration, or lactation-associated bone loss.\r"

  ".U": "87246373\r", 
  ".W": "The action of the cyclic peptide polymyxin B (a well known inhibitor of protein kinase C) on adrenal steroid synthesis was examined with Y-1 adrenal tumor cells. Polymyxin B produces a biphasic effect on the stimulation of steroid synthesis by 2 nM ACTH in these cells, with inhibition at low concentrations (less than 10 microM) and a return to control levels at high concentrations (greater than 100 microM). Polymyxin B does not inhibit the stimulatory effect of Bu2cAMP on steroidogenesis. Inhibition of the steroidogenic response to ACTH by a fixed concentration (20 microM) of polymyxin B is overcome by high concentrations of ACTH. Polymyxin B causes a concentration-dependent stimulation of steroid synthesis by Y-1 cells and, over the same concentration range, increases the production of cAMP by these cells. Polymyxin B also partially inhibits the increased production of the cyclic nucleotide produced by ACTH. In addition, polymyxin B inhibits binding of [125I](Phe2,Nle4)ACTH-(1-38) to Y-1 cells. Polymyxin B, like ACTH, promotes rounding of Y-1 cells and partially inhibits rounding produced by ACTH. These effects of polymyxin B are specific to the extent that polymyxins E1 and E2 do not exert similar effects. The actions of polymyxin B are not confined to transformed cells, since responses similar to those seen with Y-1 cells were also observed with cultured rat fasciculata cells. On the other hand, the effect of polymyxin B is specific for adrenal cells, since the cyclic peptide does not influence the steroidogenic response of rat Leydig cells to LH. It is concluded that polymyxin B is a partial agonist of ACTH which is likely to prove useful in studying the molecular basis of the interaction between ACTH and its adrenal receptor.\r"

Injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (100 mg/kg BW) either 2 or 10 h after progesterone treatment resulted in decreased levels of both receptive and proceptive sexual behavior. Similarly, injection of RU 486, an antiprogestin, 2, 6, or 10 h after progesterone injection resulted in inhibition of sexual behavior within 4-8 h after administration. Using a modified cell nuclear isolation technique for the exchange assay of nuclear-bound progestin receptors, elevated levels of progestin binding in hypothalamic cell nuclear fractions were detected as late as 14 h after progesterone injection. By 18 h after progesterone injection, nuclear progestin receptor levels had returned to baseline, a time when the period of sexual behavior had terminated in similarly treated animals. These data suggest that continued progesterone action in hypothalamic cell nuclei is required for the maintenance of progesterone-facilitated sexual behavior in the female rat. Furthermore, they suggest that progesterone action maintains sexual responsiveness by altering the synthesis of a short-lived protein or set of proteins.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation to that of pancreatic norepinephrine (NE) infusion on pancreatic somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secretion in the halothane-anesthetized dog. During electrical stimulation (8 Hz, 1 msc, 10 mA, n = 6) of the sympathetic nerves surrounding the pancreatic artery, the pancreatic SLI output decreased from 827 +/- 340 fmol/min to 231 +/- 47 fmol/min (delta = -596 +/- 217 fmol/min, P less than 0.05) after 5 min, and PP output decreased from 11,972 +/- 374 pg/min to 5,518 +/- 774 pg/min (delta = -6,454 +/- 1,932 pg/min, P less than 0.02) after 3 min of stimulation. Arterial SLI or PP levels did not change. Sympathetic nerve stimulation also decreased pancreatic blood flow and increased pancreatic venous NE levels. To determine whether the NE, released locally during sympathetic nerve stimulation, is responsible for this inhibition of pancreatic SLI and PP outputs, exogenous NE was infused into the pancreatic artery at three different dose levels. The low dose of 12 ng/min (n = 6) increased pancreatic venous NE levels like sympathetic nerve stimulation. The medium dose of 120 ng/min (n = 6) reproduced the nerve stimulation-induced decrease of pancreatic blood flow. The high dose of 1,200 ng/min (n = 6) markedly exceeded both. It was found that neither the low nor the medium infusion rates of NE significantly affected pancreatic SLI or PP output. In contrast, infusion of NE at the very high dose level of 1,200 ng/min decreased pancreatic SLI output from 850 +/- 165 fmol/min to 318 +/- 59 fmol/min after 5 min of infusion (delta = -532 +/- 143 fmol/min, P less than 0.01) and decreased PP secretion from 22,777 +/- 7,082 pg/min to 12,764 +/- 6,100 pg/min after 3 min of infusion (delta = -10,013 +/- 2,399 pg/min, P less than 0.01). During this high dose rate NE infusion, both the increment of pancreatic venous SPV levels of NE and the decrement of pancreatic blood flow markedly exceeded the effects produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation. We conclude from this study in dogs: that selective electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves entering the pancreas decreases blood flow and inhibits pancreatic SLI and PP secretion, that NE infused into the pancreatic artery at moderate rates reproduces the decrease in blood flow yet does not reproduce the inhibition of pancreatic SLI and PP secretion, and that extremely high concentrations of NE, which markedly restrict pancreatic blood flow, decrease both pancreatic SLI and PP outputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms subserving this facilitative interaction included the following. IGF-I's synergism with LDL was associated with a decrease in the mean half-maximally stimulatory concentration of LDL from 20-3.5 micrograms/ml. IGF-I increased by 3- to 6-fold the number of specific high affinity LDL receptors on ovarian cells, with no change in apparent binding affinity. IGF-I augmented by 3- and 18-fold the maximal rates of [125I]iodo-LDL internalization and degradation, respectively, without altering half-maximally effective concentrations of LDL supporting these processes. IGF-I increased by 2- to 2.5-fold the total mass of free and esterified cholesterol contained in granulosa cells. IGF-I stimulated the intracellular accumulation of free [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl ester from exogenous [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL, and amplified [3H]progesterone secretion by granulosa cells exposed to this source of lipoprotein-borne sterol. These actions of IGF-I were demonstrated at 30- to 100-fold lower concentrations of IGF-I than insulin. We conclude that IGF-I and LDL synergistically enhance progesterone biosynthesis by ovarian cells. This synergism occurs in part via mechanisms that regulate the effectual delivery of lipoprotein-borne cholesterol substrate into cellular sterol pools that participate in steroid hormone biosynthesis.\r"

  ".U": "87246389\r", 
  ".W": "Although it is well known that aluminum (Al) plays a role in the development of osteomalacia in patients with chronic renal failure, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Since the osteoblasts are the cells responsible for the formation of osteoid tissue, which is greatly affected in patients with Al-induced osteomalacia, it is possible that Al could affect the number of osteoblasts or interfere with their function. To further characterize this potential mechanism, we performed studies in isolated perfused tibiae from normal and Al-treated dogs. In this system, when PTH is added to the perfusate, cAMP, a major marker of osteoblasts, is released. The dogs were divided into two groups: control, and Al-treated (0.75 mg/kg, iv, 5 days a week for 3 months). Thereafter, the dogs were killed, and the tibiae were perfused in vitro. PTH-(1-34) (3-4 ng/ml) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase) were added to the perfusate. Basal cAMP secretion was the same in both groups of dogs. After PTH was added to the perfusate, cAMP increased to a peak of 188.2 +/- 30.6 pmol/min in the normal dogs vs. 113 +/- 8.15 in Al-treated dogs (P less than 0.05). Cumulative cAMP secretion over a 30-min period was 766 +/- 127.9 pmol in the normal dogs vs. 455.6 +/- 38.2 pmol in the experimental animals (P less than 0.05). The histological appearance of bone biopsies taken before and after Al administration are consistent with a suppressive effect of the cation on osteoblast function. In particular, the number of osteoblasts had decreased 8-fold (P less than 0.01) under the influence of Al, and tetracycline-based measurements of mineralization kinetics show that osteoblast-mediated calcification was dysfunctional (P less than 0.01-0.025). On the other hand, the histological features of the post Al treatment biopsies suggest that at some time during its administration, the cation stimulates osteoblastic activity. For example, new (woven) bone formation was present in two dogs, and in another, lamellar bone, deposited under the influence of Al, covered the entire trabecular surface. Moreover, Al-associated osteoid was deposited independent of prior resorptive activity, indicating that the cation promotes bone formation in the absence of prior resorption. In keeping with its trophic effect on matrix deposition, Al also led to extensive marrow fibrosis in five dogs, indicating that Al also stimulates the activity of fibroblasts, cells closely related to osteoblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Exposure of intact Nb2 or IM-9 cells to Met14hGH did not reduce the number of surface or intracellular receptors, as compared to the control without hormone. A parallel exposure to 500-fold lower concentrations of hGH resulted in 77-93% reduction in both surface and intracellular receptors. In contrast to [125I]hGH, [125I]Met14hGH was not taken up by the intact Nb2 lymphoma cells. Infusion of anesthetized female virgin rats for 3 h with hGH down-regulated both lactogenic and somatotropic receptors in the liver. A similar infusion with up to 200-fold higher amounts of Met14hGH did not lower the number of total receptors, indicating lack of down-regulation. Some decrease in the binding to free receptors was observed, suggesting that Met14hGH is capable of binding to liver receptors in vivo.\r"

Static cultures of trophoblast cells exposed to (Bu)2cAMP (5 mM) for 2 h released 2.6 times as much hPL as control cells (P less than 0.01) during the first 0.5 h of exposure. The increase in hPL release was followed by a decrease rate of release during the subsequent 1.5 h. Perifused trophoblast cells (1.5 X 10(6) exposed to 5 mM cAMP for 20 min released 3.2 times as much hPL as control cells. The rate of hPL increased markedly during the first 10 min of exposure, rapidly decreased toward control values during the remainder of the exposure period, and then declined to a subnormal rate for the next 30 min before returning to normal to control values. (Bu)2cAMP, however, had no acute effects on the release of human CG or the release of the cytosolic enzymes alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase. The phosphodiesterase inhibitors theophylline (5 mM) and isobutyl methylxanthine (0.5 mM) and the adenylate cyclase activators forskolin (5 micrograms/ml) and cholera toxin (25 micrograms/ml) stimulated hPL release by 75-95%. These results strongly suggest that cAMP is a second messenger in the acute release of hPL.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory have documented a progressive decline in basal and ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production in isolated adrenocortical cells as rats age. In the current study we examined the possibility that the aging process exerts this effect by interfering with the mechanism(s) by which cholesterol is processed and/or synthesized by the adrenal gland. Freshly excised adrenals from 2-, 5-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats were used for the measurement of cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, cholesteryl esterases, and acyl co-enzyme A (CoA)-cholesterol acyltransferase activities as well as key enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The results showed that cholesteryl ester content increased in a linear manner with advancing age, while neutral cholesteryl esterase activity decreased steadily until at 18 months of age it reached 40% that of 2-month-old control rats. In contrast, lysosomal acid cholesteryl esterase did not change with age, and acyl CoA: Cholesterol acyltransferase showed only a 33% decrease at 12 months of age. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreased steadily with advancing age, and at 18 months of age, activity was only half of that in 2-month-old control rats. In contrast, the activities of other enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of cholesterol, namely acetoacetyl CoA thiolase and HMG CoA synthase, were similar in 2- and 12-month-old rats, while mevalonate kinase activity was significantly lower in the 12-month-old rats. After depletion of plasma lipoprotein cholesterol by 4-aminopyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine, the intraadrenal cholesteryl ester content in young and aged animals fell significantly. Furthermore, such treatment enhanced the activities of all of the cholesterol de novo synthetic enzymes examined. In addition, HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA reductase activities rose to much greater levels in both young and old rats compared to acetoacetyl CoA thiolase and mevalonate kinase. Finally, markedly higher activities of HMG CoA reductase were observed in 12- and 18-month-old rats after 4-aminopyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine treatment. Similar results were seen using 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol to deplete cholesterol and adrenal sterol ester stores. The metabolism of endogenous cholesterol and exogenous hydroxysterols (which bypass the cAMP-dependent transport of endogenous cholesterol to mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme complex) to corticosterone by collagenase-dispersed adrenocortical cells isolated from rats of various ages were also studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At each time interval, pooled plasma samples from groups of 4 rats were extracted, lyophilized, reconstituted, and subjected to HPLC. Column fractions were radioimmunoassayed with both N- and C-terminal directed antisera. Animals housed in a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum had a significant (P less than 0.05) 24-h variation in the level of chromatographically and immunochemically identified NT in the portal circulation while the level of NT in the systemic circulation remained unchanged. The level of NT in portal blood ranged from 12-38 fmol/ml and was highest in the afternoon, 12-16 h after peak feeding. The level of NT in aortic blood never exceeded 7 fmol/ml. Similar results were obtained from animals exposed to constant illumination for 13-32 h with free access to food and water. The release of NT during the fasting phase of the feeding cycle was dependent upon the prior intake of food, since the level of NT in the hepatic-portal circulation of rats housed in 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and fasted for 20-24 h was about 2-fold less than that observed in animals allowed free access to food. In summary, these data show that the release and circulation of NT are tightly linked to the circadian pattern of food intake and that the greatest release of NT into the hepatic-portal circulation occurs 5-10 h after the cessation of eating during the fasting phase of the feeding cycle.\r"

This enzyme is one of the most important factors in regulating local action of thyroid hormone. Its activity in the rat pineal was 20-30 times higher at midnight than at noon; this nocturnal rise was abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. The beta-agonist isoproterenol, caused a 3-fold increase in diurnal enzyme activity. There is thus a marked nyctohemeral variation in T4 activation in the pineal, probably mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Since the temporal peak of pineal T4 activation corresponds to that of pineal function, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role of thyroid hormone in pineal regulation.\r"

One third of the wells with irradiated fibroblast feeder cells developed FRTL-5 colonies. One hundred and twenty clones were obtained, of which 29 (8%) developed sufficiently for functional analysis. Clones were tested for growth responses to bTSH stimulation as evidenced by 72-h [3H]thymidine uptake and TSH receptor activation by cAMP generation. Clonal growth responses to bTSH were of three types: dose-related growth increase, absence of growth stimulation, and stimulation by bTSH in concentrations up to 100 microU/ml and inhibition of growth above 100 microU/ml. All clones tested showed evidence of extracellular cAMP accumulation in response to bTSH. However, sensitivity to bTSH varied from 1 to 100 microU/ml and maximum cAMP secretion with 1 mU/ml bTSH varied from 2 to 13 pmol/ml. Whereas certain clones showed high sensitivity to bTSH with respect to both growth and cAMP responses (e.g. 1B-6), there were clones which showed disparity in this relationship, as evidenced by poor growth dependency but high cAMP responses or by growth stimulation yet insensitivity with respect to cAMP secretion. These data demonstrate that the FRTL-5 line contains cells with variable responsiveness to bTSH. Whereas the FRTL-5 line is heterogeneous and subject to developmental variation, cloning by limiting dilution allows the derivation of highly bTSH-sensitive cells, such as 1B-6, from the stock cultures.\r"

Hypophysectomy reduces hypothalamic SS content in rats, an effect that may be attributable to a change in SS synthesis, storage, or release. We tested the hypothesis that hypophysectomy would reduce hypothalamic SS synthetic capacity, as reflected by a reduction in SS mRNA levels. Using in situ hybridization and a computerized image analysis system, we measured SS mRNA signal levels over individual cells in the periventricular nucleus of hypophysectomized and intact male rats. SS mRNA signal levels were 45.1% lower in hypophysectomized rats compared to those in intact controls (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that SS synthetic capacity in the periventricular nucleus is influenced by the presence of the pituitary, and this system may represent one example of the regulation of central nervous system neuropeptide gene expression by a circulating pituitary hormone.\r"

This protein has an amino-terminal sequence through the first 28 residues that is identical to 7.5K IGF-II. The amino acid composition of 15K IGF-II, however, indicates that its carboxyl-terminal region may be different from that predicted from the analysis of IGF-II cDNA clones. The affinities of 15K IGF-II for receptors on rat placental membranes and for an IGF-binding protein that was isolated from the medium of cultured buffalo rat liver cells were similar to those of the 7.5K form of the growth factor. A best-fit analysis of data from the binding of the two mol wt forms of IGF-II to receptors on rat placental membranes by the LIGAND program was consistent with a model in which 7.5K and 15K IGF-II bound to one site with Kd values of 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 0.38 +/- 0.04, respectively. There was an indication that 15K IGF-II also bound to a second low affinity site on the membrane. In mitogenesis assays performed on human fibroblasts isolated from the skin of two fetuses of an early gestational age, 15K IGF-II stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA at a half-maximal concentration, i.e. ED50, of 5.7 and 5.0 nM. In these experiments, the ED50 values for 7.5K IGF-II were 8.7 and 15 nM.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that cholesterol synthesis is increased in the small intestine of diabetic animals and that there is an increased transport of this newly synthesized cholesterol from the small intestine into the circulation. Chylomicrons play an important role in the transport of cholesterol from the small intestine into the circulation, and the present study compared the rates of disappearance from the circulation and the fate of chylomicron cholesterol obtained from control and diabetic animals when administered to either intact control or diabetic rats. Thoracic duct lymph was collected from normal and diabetic rats after the administration of [14C]cholesterol and [3H]vitamin A1. The labeled chylomicrons were isolated by centrifugation and then administered to either control or diabetic rats. The major observation of this study is that chylomicron-associated sterols obtained from diabetic animals were cleared from the circulation in a normal manner. If one compares the rate of disappearance of either [3H]vitamin A1 or [14C] cholesterol-labeled normal chylomicrons administered to control animals with that of labeled diabetic chylomicrons administered to diabetic animals, the half-times in the circulation are almost identical (control: [3H]vitamin A1 t 1/2, 3.6 min; [14C]cholesterol t 1/2, 5.7 min; diabetic: [3H]vitamin A1 t 1/2, 3.5 min; [14C]cholesterol t 1/2, 4.4 min). In both experimental situations the rapid disappearance of [14C]cholesterol was associated with the appearance of [14C]cholesterol in the liver. Very little [14C]cholesterol was present in tissues other than liver, indicating that the rapid removal of labeled chylomicron remnants from the circulation was accounted for by hepatic uptake. These results demonstrate that in diabetic animals chylomicron-associated sterols are cleared from the circulation normally and that the bulk of intestinally derived cholesterol carried in the chylomicron lipoprotein fraction is rapidly delivered to the liver, where it could potentially influence lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently reported that iodine administration (0.05% iodine in drinking water) to weanling, diabetes mellitus- and lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT)-prone Biobreeding Worcester (BB/W) rats strikingly increases the incidence of LT without occurrence of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, which frequently results when excess iodine is administered to euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Since hypothyroidism did not occur in the iodine-treated BB/W rats, hemithyroidectomy was carried out in 30-day-old BB/W rats to increase thyroid mass and functional reserve. Iodine administration for 60 days markedly increased antithyroglobulin antibodies (0.40 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 OD; P less than 0.02), the incidence of LT (68% vs. 13%; P less than 0.001), and thyroid weight of the residual lobe (10.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.3 mg/100 g BW; P less than 0.001) and induced hypothyroidism (T4, 2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.0 micrograms/dL; P less than 0.05; T3, 25.1 +/- 1.9 vs. 37.5 ng/dL; P less than 0.001; TSH, 252 +/- 49 vs. 61 +/- 14 microU/mL; P less than 0.02). Hypothyroidism in the iodine-treated rats occurred primarily in those with LT. Similar studies were carried out in the non-diabetes mellitus-, non-LT-prone, genetically equivalent BB/W rats (W-line), the parent strain Wistar-Furth rats, and Sprague-Dawley rats. Iodine administration did not induce LT or antithyroglobulin antibodies in these three strains and did not affect thyroid function in Wistar-Furth and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, in the W-line rats, iodine excess did induce thyroid enlargement in the residual lobe (8.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.2 mg/100 g BW; P less than 0.001), a decrease in serum T3 (71.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 86.0 +/- 2.5 ng/dL; P less than 0.001), and an increase in serum TSH (344 +/- 65 vs. 69 +/- 6.0 microU/mL; P less than 0.001). It is evident, therefore, that hemithyroidectomy in BB/W rats sufficiently reduces functioning thyroid tissue, resulting in iodine-induced LT and hypothyroidism, similar to iodine-induced hypothyroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is unclear, however, why iodine administration also induced hypothyroidism in hemithyroidectomized, genetically similar, W-line rats in the absence of LT. This observation suggests that iodine-induced hypothyroidism in rats may be genetically determined.\r"

Lipolytic activity was assessed by the ability of the hormones to stimulate glycerol release from fat explants in the presence of dexamethasone and by the ability of the hormones to sensitize adipose tissue to the lipolytic stimulus theophylline. In the first experiment, adipose tissue explants were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 micrograms/ml hormone for 4 h. mGH was lipolytic at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml or greater in adipose tissue from both virgin and pregnant mice. mPRL was lipolytic at a concentration of 5.0 micrograms/ml or greater in adipose tissue from virgin mice. In adipose tissue from pregnant mice mPRL was not lipolytic in day 12 tissue, but it was lipolytic at a concentration of 5.0 micrograms/ml in day 16 tissue. mPL-II and hPL did not stimulate glycerol release in mouse adipose tissue from virgin or pregnant mice. In the second experiment preincubating adipose tissue from virgin mice in the presence of 0.5 or 5.0 micrograms/ml mGH significantly increased the ability of the tissue to respond to theophylline; however, mGH did not induce this response in adipose tissue from pregnant mice, mPRL, mPL-II, and hPL did not increase theophylline-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue from either virgin or pregnant mice. These results indicate that two lipolytic mechanisms are activated in adipose tissue from mice; mGH can activate both mechanisms, whereas mPRL can activate only one.\r"

We have used the Reuber H35 (H4IIE) rat hepatoma cell line to study the regulation of angiotensinogen mRNA levels by dexamethasone, aldosterone, L-T3, and 17 beta-estradiol. Using the Acc I (1097 basepairs) fragment of our angiotensinogen cDNA clone, we have studied, by Northern and slot blot analysis, the accumulation of angiotensinogen mRNA in this cell culture system. Angiotensinogen mRNA of approximately 1800 bases was identified in these cells. It was identical in size to angiotensinogen mRNA from rat liver. Cells grown in medium containing serum depleted of thyroid and steroid hormones for up to 72 h showed a progressive decrease in angiotensinogen mRNA. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in angiotensinogen mRNA. The half-maximal response occurred at 10(-9) M dexamethasone, with a maximal response of approximately 4-fold (serum-free conditions). Aldosterone induced a dose-dependent increase in mRNA. Half-maximal levels were obtained at 5 X 10(-8) M. Competition studies using the glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486 (Roussel-UCLAF) confirmed that dexamethasone was acting through the glucocorticoid receptor and suggested that aldosterone was acting through the same receptor. L-T3 treatment caused a dose and time-dependent increase in angiotensinogen mRNA levels. The half-maximal response occurred at 5 X 10(-8) M, and the maximal response was a 2-fold increase. Combined treatment with dexamethasone and L-T3 triiodothyronine resulted in a synergistic increase in angiotensinogen mRNA levels. 17 beta-Estradiol failed to elicit a change in angiotensinogen mRNA levels consistent with the observation that these cells lack estrogen receptors. Our results indicate that hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA levels are regulated in a complex fashion by several hormones. These cells provide a useful system for studying the hormonal regulation of the angiotensinogen gene.\r"

  ".W": "One physiological role for endogenous opioid peptides is to attenuate the release of oxytocin (OT) from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system during dehydration and hemorrhage when vasopressin maintains fluid balance and blood pressure. During lactation, OT, which stimulates milk ejection, is released without vasopressin. The influence of endogenous opioid peptides on OT release during suckling has been studied primarily in animals anesthetized with urethane. In addition to anesthesia, urethane dehydrates the animal by elevating plasma osmolality and reducing cardiovascular volume. Thus, we examined in lactating rats the response of the magnocellular neuroendocrine system to dehydration and the role of endogenous opioid peptides in regulating OT release during suckling under conditions of altered fluid balance in conscious and urethane-anesthetized rats. Release of OT in response to an increase in plasma osmolality or a decrease in blood volume was attenuated during lactation in both conscious and anesthetized rats. Blockade of opiate receptors with naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not alter suckling-induced release of immunoreactive OT in conscious, normally hydrated rats, but did augment hormone release after urethane (1.1 g/kg, ip) or after osmotic stimulation with hypertonic sodium chloride (2.5%; 20 ml/kg, ip). During dehydration, the combination of decreased responsiveness of oxytocinergic neurons to osmotic stimulation and inhibition of OT release by opioid peptides may be important in the lactating rat for conserving pituitary stores of OT needed for milk ejection.\r"

To investigate the physiological relevancy of this effect, the activity of methylating enzyme(s) was evaluated during the rat estrous cycle, a period in which both endogenous ovarian steroid levels and the sensitivity of pituitary membrane receptors fluctuate. Anterior pituitary membranes (P2) were prepared from adult female rats at different stages of the estrous cycle and assayed for phospholipid methylation in the presence of S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine as a donor of 3H-methyl groups. Methylated phospholipids were separated by TLC. Formation of phosphatidyl-mono- and dimethylethanolamine and that of phosphatidylcholine increased significantly in the morning, reaching maximal values on the afternoon of proestrus; they decreased thereafter during estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Plasma estradiol concentrations increased in late diestrus and then varied similarly with the fluctuations of phospholipid methyltransferase activity throughout the cycle. In parallel, plasma levels of LH and PRL were significantly elevated during the afternoon of proestrus, but remained low throughout the rest of the cycle. Under the same experimental conditions, phospholipid methylation in membranes prepared from mediobasal-hypothalamic structures was not affected. These data demonstrate that under physiological conditions the increased pituitary methyltransferase activity is associated with the progressive increment of plasma estradiol levels occurring shortly before proestrus and precedes the release of LH and PRL. Ovariectomy significantly decreased methyltransferase activity; however, 17 beta-estradiol treatment of ovariectomized rats for 5 days restored the enzyme activity, which was further augmented after progesterone administration. Attempting to investigate variations of pituitary methyltransferase activity in male rats, we demonstrated that the intact males showed weaker activity than that of females; orchidectomy diminished the phospholipid methylation, but adrenalectomy had no effect.\r"

Twenty-four hours after the last dose of CsA, the animals were killed and the following parameters were measured: testis, seminal vesicle, and ventral prostate weights; serum levels of CsA, creatinine, testosterone (T), and LH; and intratesticular levels of pregnenolone, progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and T.

There was no significant change in the androstenedione levels in any of the CsA-treated groups. To determine whether the decrease in T production by the testis exposed to CsA is via inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, serum LH was measured in all four groups. Serum LH decreased significantly only in the 15 and 30 mg/kg CsA-treated groups. These data suggest that oral CsA administration in doses greater than 15 mg/kg X day results in diminished intratesticular T production that appears to be mediated via inhibition of pituitary LH function.\r"

  ".W": "The POMC gene is expressed in testicular Leydig cells, but its mRNA is about 150-200 nucleotides shorter in these cells than in the pituitary. For this reason this testicular mRNA has been termed POMC-like mRNA. The purpose of the present study was to define the ontogeny and regulation of POMC gene expression in rat testis. The level of POMC-like mRNA was very low in the testes of 15- and 20-day-old animals. A dramatic increase in mRNA concentration was observed between 20 and 25 days of age, and maximal levels were detected at 40 days. The ontogeny of testicular POMC gene expression correlates with the reported increases in Leydig cell numbers, immunostainable beta-endorphin in Leydig cells, and testicular LH receptors during development. Since these observations suggested that the expression of testicular POMC gene might be influenced by LH, we studied the effect of hypophysectomy and hCG treatment on testicular POMC-like mRNA. Total contents of testicular RNA and POMC-like mRNA decreased in parallel with the decline of testicular weight after hypophysectomy. Administration of hCG to rats 6 days after hypophysectomy prevented the regression of testes and the decrease in testicular POMC-like mRNA content. An increase in the total amount of testicular POMC-like mRNA was observed relative to that in hypophysectomized controls after 8 days of hCG injection. Similar results were obtained when hCG was administered to rats 13 days after hypophysectomy. The effect of glucocorticoid deprivation on testicular POMC-like mRNA was also studied. The POMC-like mRNA concentration did not increase in testis as it did in the anterior pituitary after adrenalectomy, suggesting that glucocorticoids are not a primary regulator of POMC-like mRNA in the testis. In summary, the ontogeny of expression of testicular POMC gene correlates closely with the maturation pattern of Leydig cells; and the expression of testicular POMC gene is regulated by gonadotropins and not by glucocorticoids. We conclude that the regulation of POMC-like mRNA in the testis is different from that in the pituitary.\r"

The bFGF gene is transcribed into 7.0- and 3.7-kilobase mRNA transcripts which are apparently translated into 16,000 mol wt bFGF-like growth factor. The granulosa cell-derived bFGF is bioactive, i.e. it can stimulate the proliferation of capillary endothelial or granulosa cells. This mitogenic effect is prevented by specific neutralizing anti-bFGF antibodies. Our results indicate that bFGF derived from granulosa cells can act as both autocrine and paracrine growth factor, and they further suggest that the factor may be involved in the development of the rich vasculature of the theca interna of the follicle.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of PRL and GH within adenohypophysial cells has been investigated with immunocytochemical methodology using colloidal gold of different sizes. Classically, using morphological criteria at the light and electron microscope levels, two types of individual cells have been described which, it is believed, exclusively produce either PRL or GH, i.e. mammotrophs and somatotrophs. Since it has been reported that some gonadotrophs may colocalize and secrete both FSH and LH, and that some unidentified cells release both PRL and GH, we designed a study to investigate whether PRL and GH are present only in their respective specific cells or may be colocalized in mammotrophs and somatotrophs or possibly other types of cells within the pars distalis. Using immunocytochemistry at the electron microscope level we were able to label the two hormones with different sizes of colloidal gold bound to a second antibody and visualize them within pituitary cells. Two different primary antibodies to PRL and GH as well as a more purified antibody to GH were used. Pituitaries from cycling and lactating female rats and adult males were processed appropriately for electron microscopic studies. After sectioning, individual grids were treated with either primary antibodies for PRL or GH, or the same grid was treated sequentially with these two antibodies. All primary antibodies were absorbed with the heterologous hormone before usage. The second antibodies were bound to colloidal gold particles of either 10 nm (for GH) or 20 nm (for PRL) diameter, so that selective visualization of the two hormones could be achieved within the same cells. It was observed that mammotrophs immunolabeled only for PRL, and somatotrophs labeled only for GH regardless of the source of the antibody. However, an atypical small granule cell, a possible mammosomatotroph, colabeled consistently for both PRL and GH in all types of animals used and with antibodies from all of above sources. This report gives for the first time morphological evidence for the existence of pituitary cells that colocalize both PRL and GH in the normal rat pituitary gland. The possibility that these bihormonal cells represent stem cells which may give rise to both mammotrophs and somatotrophs under appropriate stimulation or that they may release both hormones under the influence of unspecific stimuli is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the influence of assay conditions on the 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) sensitivity of the iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) from hypothyroid rats. These results were compared with similar studies of 5'-deiodinase activity in kidney microsomes from euthyroid animals. Even though BAT microsomes contain largely type II (PTU-insensitive) deiodinase activity, the 5'-deiodination of T4 can be inhibited by PTU if the dithiothreitol (DTT) concentration in the assay is reduced to 5 mM or less. The apparent Ki for PTU of BAT microsomes was 4.3 mM at 5.0 mM DTT and 0.41 mM at 0.5 mM DTT. The kinetics of inhibition were noncompetitive. With kidney microsomes, PTU inhibition of rT3 5'-deiodination was both time and enzyme/substrate ratio dependent. For example, using 1 microgram microsomal protein, 2 nM rT3, and 5 mM DTT, the inhibitory effect of PTU was not maximal until 12 min after PTU addition. At stable reaction velocities PTU inhibition was uncompetitive, and the Ki was about 1 microM. Deiodination by kidney microsomes was completely inhibited by 50 microM PTU. Even though it is possible to inhibit the type II 5'-deiodinase activity with high concentrations of PTU (in the presence of low DTT concentrations), the deiodinase in kidney is about 1000-fold more sensitive to PTU. By these criteria the kidney microsome 5'-deiodinase is type I.\r"
