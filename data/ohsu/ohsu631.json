These consist of using disposable items, steam sterilization, disinfection by both chemical methods and pasteurization and the use of ethylene oxide sterilization. The use of disposable bacterial and viral filtres to protect ventilators and soda lime cannisters is discussed. These can then be sterilized by ethylene oxide at less frequent intervals, i.e., weekly. Protection of the anaesthetists' skin from contact with body fluids by the use of barrier methods are stressed. Methods to avoid penetration of the skin by needlestick and sharp objects are discussed. The increasing number of persons being treated for opportunistic infections makes it likely that anaesthetists will encounter increasing numbers of patients infected with HIV. The more common infections encountered in the operating room in North America have been included, with methods of avoiding possible infection from them. Constant vigilance and the use of universal precautions when caring for all patients is therefore required by the anaesthetist in the operating room in order to avoid contacting infection from patients.\r"

Randomly selected communities, physicians, and patients in Michigan were the subjects of this study. Data on the care practices of physicians and patients and care outcomes were collected from 1980 to 1981 and again in 1985 from eight communities, 61 physicians, and 261 patients. We found that the use of multiple injections of insulin and self-monitoring of blood glucose increased significantly, whereas hospitalizations for diabetes control decreased. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin values for this cohort of patients remained unchanged. The study results suggest that, for patients under the active care of community physicians, modern methods of diabetes care are being implemented, but the results of improved care do not show an impact on blood glucose control as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin values. The study was not designed to establish causation for the decrease in hospitalizations for these patients, but the data suggest that decreases may be more a function of changes in health-care policies rather than changes in patient health.\r"

  ".W": "Raised levels of plasma fibronectin (PF), an alpha 2-glycoprotein produced by vascular endothelia, have been previously described in diabetic patients with retinopathy and overt nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of microalbuminuria is associated with increased PF concentrations. Twenty Albustix-negative diabetic outpatients with microalbuminuria [median albumin excretion rate (AER): 30.2 micrograms/min; range 12.1-194 micrograms/min] were compared with 58 sex- and age-matched patients without microalbuminuria (median AER 3.1 micrograms/min; range 0.8-12 micrograms/min) and 34 control subjects (median AER 2.8 micrograms/min; range 0.8-12.1 micrograms/min). Mean PF was significantly higher in the group with microalbuminuria (406.7 +/- 85.5 micrograms/ml) than in the group without it (325.3 +/- 76.5 micrograms/ml or in control subjects (334.5 +/- 76 micrograms/ml; P less than .05). PF increase associated with microalbuminuria was independent of the presence of retinopathy. Furthermore, in the whole group of diabetic patients, PF was significantly correlated with AER (r = .33; P = .003). Such correlation also remained significant (P = .0002) after covariance analysis by a stepwise discriminant procedure taking into account age, duration of disease, sex, blood pressure, body weight, therapy, and HbA1. In conclusion, PF increase is associated with microalbuminuria independent of the other considered variables; its role as a possible marker for early diabetic nephropathy remains to be fully clarified.\r"

The patients were followed up for greater than or equal to 12 mo and classified as NIR if adequate glycemic control could be achieved without insulin (i.e., fasting plasma glucose less than 8 mM and no glycosuria). Patients who needed insulin to obtain this status were classified as IR. We found that all subjects with plasma C-peptide values greater than 0.60 nM 6 min after intravenous glucagon were NIR, whereas all IR subjects together with 3 NIR subjects had C-peptide values below this limit. All NIR subjects but 1 had fasting C-peptide values greater than 0.30 nM, and all IR subjects but 1 had C-peptide values below this limit. Seventy-five percent of the subjects could be correctly classified by use of age and percent desirable body weight. Thus, all subjects greater than 40 yr old and greater than 100% ideal body weight were NIR, and all subjects below both these limits were IR. Ketonuria was found in 10 of 12 IR subjects and in 10 of 29 NIR subjects. We conclude that 1) 75% of the subjects could be correctly classified by use of age and percent desirable body weight only and 2) C-peptide measurements are useful in the classification of newly diagnosed diabetes, whereas presence of ketonuria is of limited value.\r"

The sample included 343 patients with NIDDM initially entered into the study in 1981-1982 and reexamined in 1985-1986. Mortality data were collected on reexamination in 1985 and updated from death-certificate data through 1 January 1986. The data collected from the patients included demographic and clinical variables, psychosocial variables related to diabetes, measures of physiologic control, hospitalization, and mortality. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to compute a hazard rate for each individual and to determine risk covariates. The results indicated that the variables most associated with the risk of mortality were patient age, social impact of diabetes, renal function, complexity of diet regimen, and history of smoking. Two of these variables (social impact and complexity of diet regimen) were obtained from the Diabetes Educational Profile completed by all patients on entry to the study. The five predictor variables were more closely related to mortality than diabetes control as measured by HbA1, previous hospital admissions, previous heart attacks, and other physiologic measures frequently used as outcome measures. The only physiologic predictor was renal function.\r"

Eight well-controlled patients received, in a randomly assigned crossover design over two 2-mo study periods, 30 g of fructose in exchange for an isocaloric amount of starch. Fructose could be taken at any time during the day as part of the 1400-1600 kcal allowed diet (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 20% protein). No significant difference was observed concerning body weight, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, uric acid, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, nor was there any change in insulin binding to erythrocytes between the fructose and the control starch period. However, the mean plasma triglyceride levels after the fructose period, although still in the normal range, were significantly higher than baseline values (P less than .05). We conclude that moderate amounts of fructose incorporated into the diet of well-controlled type II diabetic subjects have no significant deleterious effect on glycemic control, insulin receptors of erythrocytes, or lipid metabolism.\r"

Twenty-nine individuals with diabetes mellitus, 16 with stable visual impairment and 13 with fluctuating and transitional visual impairment, underwent psychological assessment before and after entering into a specially designed rehabilitation program. Low levels of performance were rehabilitation program. Low levels of performance were demonstrated by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Diabetes Self-Reliance Test in both groups. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Rand Mental Health Index suggested that subjects with stable vision impairment were moderately compensated relative to the transitional group, although the former group may have been totally blind. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in psychological profiles after the program. It is suggested that a rehabilitation program may be of clinical benefit early in the course of vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy.\r"

Ten patients had encountered 21 vials of flocculated insulin in the previous 12 mo, reflecting an incidence of 1 per 72 vials. Insulin drawn from affected vials was markedly reduced in potency: 20.9 +/- 3.4 U/ml vs. the labeled potency of 100 U/ml. Several patients reporting flocculated insulin, including one hospitalized with ketoacidosis, experienced unusual and unexplained elevation in blood glucose concentration for several days before flocculation was observed. Patients who use NPH human insulin should be aware of this phenomenon and carefully inspect their vials for evidence of insulin precipitation before each injection.\r"

The EMR (prebreakfast CBG-midsleep CGB) was inversely related to the midsleep CBG level (r = -.45, P less than .001). Of the 49 children with midsleep CBG less than 200 mg/dl, the mean EMR was 34 +/- 60 mg/dl, and 18 of these children had rises of greater than 40 mg/dl. In conclusion, when midsleep glycemia is less than 200 mg/dl, a rise in blood glucose from midsleep to prebreakfast, often greater than 40 mg/dl, is a common element of glycemic control among children with IDDM. The relative importance of the Somogyi phenomenon, the dawn phenomenon, and mere insulin insufficiency in the early-morning hours cannot be determined from these data.\r"

Thirty adults with insulin-dependent diabetes used memory meters and recorded test results in diaries for 2 wk while performing their normal SMBG regimen. Analysis of glucose diaries showed that only 23% of the subjects had no diary errors and 47% had clinically accurate diaries (less than 10% error rate). The most common types of errors were omissions of values contained in meter memory and additions of values not contained in meter memory, with significantly more omissions than additions. Alterations of test values (e.g., changing a 300-mg/dl reading to 200 mg/dl) were extremely rare. There was no difference in the rate of errors that resulted in a more positive clinical profile (omitting unacceptable values and adding acceptable values) or a more negative clinical profile (omitting acceptable values and adding unacceptable values). Examination of the actual frequency of SMBG showed that most subjects (56.6%) measured their BG an average of two to three times each day. Self-report of SMBG frequency correlated with both actual frequency and HbA1. Although actual frequency of SMBG was not related to physicians' recommendations, the majority (64%) of subjects were self-testing as often or more often than they had been instructed.\r"

The proximal anastomosis group had a conception rate of 71% (50% live births, 30% spontaneous abortions, 6% ectopic pregnancies). The terminal salpingoneostomy group, which accounted for the largest number of procedures, had a conception rate of 47% (32% live births, 12% spontaneous abortions, 11% ectopic pregnancies). Even after microsurgical tubal reconstruction, most women do not achieve a live birth. Pregnancy outcome is probably related to several factors reflecting the severity of pre-existing intrinsic damage. Prognostic factors that may better predict pregnancy outcome are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To study the prevalence of osteoporosis and hyperandrogenism in neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia, the authors evaluated 10 patients. Three were amenorrheic, while seven had oligomenorrhea. Nine patients had galactorrhea. The Ferriman-Gallway hirsutism score was 12 +/- 2. Vaginal smear maturation value was 53 +/- 8. Bone density, measured by dual photon absorptionometry in the spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and trochanteric region, was 98 +/- 1.5, 92.7 +/- 3, 88.5 +/- 4.2, and 92.6 +/- 3.3 percentile of controls matched for age, sex, weight, and ethnicity, respectively. Serum prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total testosterone, and free testosterone were 82 +/- 10 ng/ml, 8.5 +/- 1.1 mIU/ml, 11.1 +/- 2.6 mIU/ml, 4695 +/- 594 ng/ml, 90 +/- 17 ng%, and 2.36% +/- 0.3%, respectively. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine index were normal. Bone density strongly correlated with vaginal maturation value (r = 0.904, P less than 0.01). It is concluded that (1) neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia is associated with hirsutism and androgen excess primarily of adrenal origin and (2) a subset of these patients is at an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. It may be possible to identify patients at risk of osteoporosis by examining vaginal smears for maturation value. Early detection and management are imperative in this group of patients.\r"

The magnitude of the variation was not affected by whether the biopsy specimen was obtained in the mid or late luteal phase, the degree of lag between the dating and subsequent menses, or the presence of an LPD. Redating of a specimen by another pathologist would have resulted in a change in the determination of \"in\" or \"out\" of phase in 22% of cases. The subsequent probability of changing patient management altered ranged from 22% to 39% depending on the clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "So far, the use of epostane, a relatively new inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase enzyme system (3 beta-HSD), has been confined to short-term interference with luteal and placental function. This study explored whether epostane treatment from the beginning of the cycle for approximately 1 month would also inhibit ovarian follicular function. Twenty females with regular cycles received epostane 150 mg/day (ten healthy volunteers) or 600 mg/day (ten patients with endometriosis). Blood samples were drawn three times per week during control and treatment cycles. At 150 mg/day the mean total area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) of estradiol (E2) was somewhat higher than during the control cycles, despite apparently lower preovulatory E2 surges. During medication the highest value of E2 was found during the luteal phase. The mean AUC of progesterone (P) and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) during the luteal surge was decreased by approximately 45% each. At 600 mg/day all evaluable patients had lower AUC of E2 than during the control cycle. The mean decrease in AUC of P and 17-OHP was much more pronounced than in the lower dose group. Six of the ten patients showed no hormonal signs of follicular development and, consequently, anovulation. The capacity of epostane to modulate or inhibit, depending on the dose, ovarian follicular steroidogenesis and ovulation may prove valuable in a variety of clinical conditions.\r"

Forty-six ET were performed in group A and 34 in group B. Clinical pregnancies were achieved in 20 patients of group A (11.5% per treatment cycle) and 13 of group B (26.0%), for a combined rate of 16.8% per cycle. Patients with tubal infertility treated in the program had a pregnancy rate of 18.8% per treatment cycle. The performance of the secondary unexplained infertility group is significantly better than that of the primary unexplained infertility group. However, the overall results with patients with unexplained infertility are similar to those patients treated for tubal infertility.\r"

The number of gestational sacs at 8 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, at 20 weeks, and the number of term pregnancies were studied longitudinally. Twelve patients (14.8%) had 2 pre-embryos transferred, 19 (23.5%) had 3, 21 (25.9%) had 4, 17 (21.0%) had 5, 9 (11.1%) had 6, and 3 (3.7%) had 7.

Total embryo loss at 8 to 12 weeks was 53.0%; when the \"index\" embryo was excluded, it reached 61%. Regardless of the number of pre-embryos transferred, only 2.2 embryos on average were able to establish a normal pregnancy. (A)synchronism of the pre-embryos did not affect outcome.

Because many patients enrolled in these protocols will be exposed to both ovulation induction and diagnostic laparoscopy, the authors reasoned that it would be more effective to begin ovulation induction at the time of the proposed diagnostic laparoscopy in order to allow gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT) at the same time. Twenty-five nulliparous patients underwent diagnostic GIFT. There were eight continuing pregnancies in this group (32%).

Patients were begun on sequential E2 and progesterone replacement with transdermal E2 patches. Endometrial biopsies were done on day 21 of the first replacement cycle and day 26 of the second cycle. Controls were 28 cycles on a regular 28-day micronized OE2 protocol. No significant difference was found between E2 levels throughout the cycle of the two respective stimulation protocols, except for days 12 to 14, when the OE2 protocol produced significantly lower E2 than did the TE2 protocol (P less than 0.01). A positive, highly significant correlation was found between estrone (E1) and E2 values in the OE2 group (r = 0.92) (P less than 0.003). During OE2 administration, E1 was significantly higher than E2 (P less than 0.01). E1 was not found to be higher than E2 in the TE2 group, resulting in a significant difference in the E2/E1 ratio of 1.59 +/- 1.6 for TE2 compared with 0.13 +/- .04 for OE2 (P less than 0.05). Early biopsies in patients on TE2 revealed glandular components that were dated as day 18.2 +/- 1.7, while the stroma was dated as day 21.8 +/- 0.8, a statistically significant disparity (P less than 0.01). In patients on OE2, the same significant 3-day glandular/stromal disparity was observed (P less than 0.05).

Two groups of 34 patients were induced for ovulation with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropins. One group was given 25 mg P (Gesterol, Steris Laboratory Inc., Phoenix, AZ) at the time of, or 4 to 6 hours before human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration and another group served as control (no Gesterol). Of the 34 patients in the Gesterol group, 10 had Gesterol 4 to 6 hours before the administration of hCG, 13 at the time of hCG, and 11 after the spontaneous LH surge. Administration of Gesterol 4 to 6 hours before hCG significantly increased the LH values (19.0 +/- 10.3) compared with those who had Gesterol at the time of hCG (6.8 +/- 2.8, P = 0.0006). A single dose of Gesterol (25 mg P) significantly reduced the E2/P ratio during the luteal phase (P = 0.0005). However, the outcome of IVF-ET was the same in the Gesterol and no-Gesterol groups. It is concluded that a significant increase in P triggers an LH surge and a single dose of Gesterol decreases E2/P ratio in the luteal phase of women after ovarian stimulation. The biochemical mechanisms are unclear.\r"

The optimal number clusters determined by calculation of the variance criterion was five. The resulting five groups partly correspond to the prevailing descriptive classification system as far as the extreme groups of \"high-grade oligoteratoasthenozoospermia\" and \"polyzoospermia\" are concerned. Surprisingly, cluster analysis distinguished between two groups of normozoospermia that differed in their mean sperm density.

After 16 hours of incubation 18.5% of the spermatozoa in insemination medium alone were acrosome-reacted compared to 31.5% for spermatozoa incubated in medium containing oocytes. The acrosome reaction of spermatozoa incubated with fertilized or unfertilized oocytes was also investigated. The percentage of acrosome reaction did not differ (P greater than 0.05) between the two groups (29.7% in the fertilized cases versus 30.7% in the unfertilized cases). Completion of oocyte nuclear maturation did not affect the proportion of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa observed with unfertilized eggs. A similar (P greater than 0.05) percentage of acrosome reacted spermatozoa were observed regardless of whether the unfertilized oocytes had (29%) or had not (35%) reached metaphase II. These findings indicate the acrosome reaction of human spermatozoa is enhanced in the presence of vested human oocytes. Furthermore, there is no apparent correlation between the percentage of the population of spermatozoa that acrosome react in the medium and the potential of an oocyte for fertilization.\r"

For motility, the CellSoft values were usually higher than those obtained by visual counting (mean difference = -17.5%, 95% range = -56.0% to +21.0%). Multiple regression analyses revealed a strong concentration dependency such that reliable values will probably be obtained only if all samples are diluted (with homologous seminal plasma) before CellSoft analysis.

Human chorionic gonadotropin given repeatedly fails to induce PRL secretion in anovulatory monkeys but prolongs the luteal phase and thereby PRL secretion in ovulatory monkeys.

The overall attrition rate was 12.4% (699/5,656), and varied by the type of residency program. The most frequent reason for attrition as identified by the survey respondent was switching specialties (41.0%), followed by private practice 16.4% and involuntarily released 11.9%. The remainder left for a variety of other reasons. There was a slightly higher attrition rate for women (14.2%) than men (11.9%). The odds ratio for this was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.41). Women were more likely to leave for childbearing or rearing, or spouse relocation, although overall these numbers were small, and men also left for these same reasons.\r"

Usefulness and acceptability of the technique was assessed in symptomatic patients in a family practice population. Collaborating family physicians performed 66 examinations, which required 4.6 +/- 0.60 minutes (mean +/- SD) to complete. The median patient discomfort score was 2 on a 0-10 scale ranging from \"no discomfort\" to \"severe discomfort.\" Change in diagnosis by the primary physician was made in 13 of 18 patients, and change in management plan in 10 of 12 patients, after the examination. Important findings included primary diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma, unsuspected nasal polyps, and normal examinations of high quality. These preliminary findings suggest that flexible fiberoptic rhinolaryngoscopy by family physicians is a useful examination, requires little time, and is acceptable to patients. Further study is suggested before general use is advocated.\r"

Patients were given a self-administered questionnaire for measuring stress, family functioning, and psychological symptoms. All patients were followed for at least six weeks. Resolution of the pain was documented by chart audit, telephone, or mail follow-up. Two-thirds of the patients experienced resolution of their pain within six to eight weeks. The scores on the Hopkins Psychological Symptom Checklist, Family APGAR, and the Daily Hassles Stress Scale did not predict resolution of pain. Age, sex, education, occupation, and final diagnosis also did not predict resolution of pain. Marital status was not associated with pain resolution, though widowed and separated individuals more often had pain at follow-up.\r"

Previous studies have found an association between scores on the MSSI and home stimulation of preschool children, child maltreatment, and low birthweight. This report examines the test-retest reliability, internal consistency and concurrent and predictive validity of the MSSI in three samples of mothers (N = 488) from a prenatal clinic, pediatric clinic, and psychology clinic. The MSSI was found to have a test-retest correlation of .72 (P less than 0.001) over six to eight weeks. Coefficient alphas ranged from .60 to .63 across the three samples, denoting moderate internal consistency. In the psychology clinic sample, the MSSI was found to be positively correlated with the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (r = .393, P less than 0.001) and inversely correlated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (r = .296, P less than 0.001). The MSSI is a brief, reliable instrument with acceptable internal consistency and concurrent and predictive validity. It may be employed in the primary care arenas of clinical research and patient care to provide an organized assessment of maternal social support.\r"

Defectors anticipated a diminishing clinical role for future family practitioners, expressed doubt about the financial viability of smaller community based family practices, and explicitly linked concerns about their anticipated debt load to their changes in career preferences. This study also identified a subgroup of \"potential defector\" students (within the stayer cohort) who maintained an interest in family practice but evidenced concerns similar to the defector students. Implications of these findings for the future supply of primary care physicians for rural and traditionally underserved communities are discussed.\r"

Since the late 1970s these programs have trained 259 fellows and 3,284 other participants. In total, $7,515,350 in federal dollars were spent. A variety of program formats and strategies were used to recruit faculty, and to prepare them in teaching, research, and other skill areas. Interviews (as well as phone conversations and letters) with key personnel at each site resulted in a summary of 30 critical elements identified for effective faculty development. Additionally, respondents made 11 specific recommendations to the Federal Faculty Development Grant Program that concern funding and future programs.\r"

The purpose of this study was to reinvestigate whether chronic hypertension has a consistent effect on acute hypertensive disruption of the blood-brain barrier and to determine whether one of the previously studied models has an unusual response to chronic hypertension. We studied four rat models of chronic hypertension: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), two-kidney, 1 clip Goldblatt rats (2K1C), rats treated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and NaCl, Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high salt diet, and two groups of normotensive controls: Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a low salt diet. We caused acute hypertension in some rats with the use of bicuculline (1.2 mg/kg) and aortic occlusion. Rats without acute hypertension served as controls. Blood-brain barrier disruption was quantitated using the brain/blood ratio of 125I-labeled albumin. Acute hypertensive disruption was less in SHR, rats treated with DOCA-NaCl, and Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high salt diet, but not in 2K1C rats, as compared with normotensive controls. Acute hypertensive disruption was greater in Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a low salt diet than in WKY. A series of control WKY, SHR, rats treated with DOCA-NaCl, 2K1C rats, and Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed low or high salt diets, but not subjected to acute hypertension, were also studied. Brain/blood 125I-albumin ratios were significantly less in these control rats not subjected to acute hypertension than in rats subjected to acute hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine whether responses of cerebral arterioles to products released by platelets are impaired in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The diameter of pial arterioles was measured during suffusion with adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, and the thromboxane analogue U-46619, using intravital microscopy in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHRSP (7-10 months old). Responses of cerebral arterioles to ADP and serotonin were profoundly impaired in SHRSP. ADP (10(-5) M) increased pial arteriolar diameter 17 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE) in WKY and only 4 +/- 1% in SHRSP. Serotonin (10(-5) M) increased pial arteriolar diameter 15 +/- 2% in WKY and, in contrast, reduced the diameter 13 +/- 1% in SHRSP. Nitroglycerin produced a similar dilatation of cerebral arterioles in WKY and SHRSP, suggesting that impairment of dilatation in SHRSP in response to ADP and serotonin was not related to nonspecific impairment of vasodilatation in SHRSP. The thromboxane analogue U-46619 produced a similar constriction of arterioles in WKY and SHRSP. We also examined the possibility that impaired dilator responses of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP in response to ADP and serotonin may be related to production of a cyclooxygenase vasoconstrictor substance. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg i.v.) partially restored dilator responses to ADP and serotonin in SHRSP, without altering responses in WKY. Thus, we speculate that vasoactive substances released by platelets may release a prostanoid constrictor substance from cerebral vessels of SHRSP and thereby predispose SHRSP to cerebral ischemia and, perhaps, stroke.\r"

Animals were maintained for 5 to 7 days on either a \"normal\" or high NaCl diet. Tissue norepinephrine turnover was evaluated by measuring the rate at which norepinephrine content decreased following tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. Blood pressure was higher (p less than 0.05) in DS (135 +/- 2 [SE] mm Hg) than in DR (129 +/- 2 mm Hg) and was not affected by the diets. Extracellular fluid volume and net Na+ and Cl- balances did not differ between DS and DR. However, plasma volume was greater in DS than in DR (p less than 0.05). In both fat and heart, norepinephrine turnover was decreased by dietary NaCl loading in DR (p less than 0.01), but not in DS. Thus, the tendency of the DS to become hypertensive with high NaCl intake may be related to the combined effects of an increased plasma volume and the failure of high dietary NaCl to inhibit peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity.\r"

The analysis was performed separately in the total group and in the group not receiving treatment for hypertension. A highly significant negative correlation existed between serum sodium and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Serum potassium correlated negatively with blood pressure only in men. Serum phosphorus correlated negatively in men and women with systolic blood pressure. Serum calcium correlated positively with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in men, but only with diastolic blood pressure in women. All these correlations were independent of serum total protein.

Multiple regression analysis adjusting for age, body mass index, heart rate, alcohol intake, and total caloric intake revealed a significant positive correlation between sodium intake and blood pressure in the group not treated for hypertension except for diastolic blood pressure in women. A significant negative correlation was found between dietary calcium intake and diastolic blood pressure in men and between dietary magnesium intake and systolic blood pressure in women. No independent effect of dietary potassium intake on blood pressure could be established. Significant but weak correlations were found between the dietary intake of sodium, potassium and calcium and their serum values. The study confirms the hypothesis that at the population level dietary cations are related to the regulation of blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The adaptive effects of physical training on cardiovascular control mechanisms were studied in 11 subjects with mild hypertension. In these subjects we assessed the gain of the heart period-systolic arterial pressure relationship in the unfit and the fit state by using 1) an open loop approach, whereby the gain is expressed by the slope of the regression of heart period as a function of systolic arterial pressure, during a phenylephrine-induced pressure rise and 2) a closed loop approach with proper simplification, whereby the gain is expressed by the index alpha, obtained through simultaneous spectral analysis of the spontaneous variabilities of heart period and systolic arterial pressure. Both methods indicated that training significantly increased the gain of the relationship between heart period and systolic arterial pressure at rest and reduced arterial pressure and increased heart period significantly. This gain was drastically reduced during bicycle exercise both in the unfit and fit state. In a second group of normotensive (n = 7; systolic pressure, 133 +/- 3 mm Hg) and hypertensive (n = 7; systolic pressure, 180 +/- 10 mm Hg) subjects undergoing 24-hour diagnostic continuous electrocardiographic and high fidelity arterial pressure monitoring, the index alpha was significantly reduced in the hypertensive group at rest. Furthermore, when analyzed continuously over the entire 24-hour period, this index underwent minute-to-minute changes with lower values during the day and higher values during the night. We propose the index alpha as a quantitative indicator of the changes in the gain of baroreceptor mechanisms occurring with physical training in mild hypertension and during a 24-hour period in ambulatory subjects.\r"

The values for a volumetric factor (Vf) related to the increment in plasma PAE concentrations were found to increase during the first hour of treatment (72 litres at steady-state), and then to progressively decrease. The changes in the kinetic parameters during the dialysis session were grouped into three phases according to the fate of the plasticiser in the patient.

  ".W": "In two groups of patients on chronic haemodialysis treatment, the common PVC-DEHP blood tubing was replaced with tubing containing tri-(2-ethylhexyl)-trimellate (TOTM) as plasticizer. The aim of the present study was to measure the amount of TOTM and/or its metabolites (TAE s) in plasma, resulting from TOTM that might leach from the dialysis tubes. The arterial levels of TAE s at the start of the dialysis sessions were monitored by Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) analysis once a week for a period of 42 days. A gradual decrease in TAE was observed during the first 21 days of the haemodialysis treatment with the PVC-TOTM tubes. After three weeks, the TAE levels remained constant until the end of the study. On day 120 of the haemodialysis treatment, the plasma TAE concentrations from the inflow and outflow tubes of the dialyzer were monitored during a single haemodialysis session at different times after starting dialysis. At the beginning of the dialysis session, the mean concentration of TAE was 55.81 +/- 14.98 ng/ml (mean +/- standard error), while at the end the levels were 73.34 +/- 17.05 ng/ml. There were no significant differences between venous and arterial sampling points in the trimellitic ester concentrations. Less TOTM is apparently leached from haemodialysis than DEHP. TOTM can be recommended as an alternative plasticizer to DEHP, but its possible toxicity in humans should be investigated before it can be used routinely.\r"

  ".W": "The type of metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic renal failure was studied prospectively over a three-month period in 32 stable patients on chronic hemodialysis using acetate. All patients had pre-dialysis metabolic acidosis (mean TCO2 = 16.6 +/- 0.4 mEq/l, range 10 to 23 mEq/l). The patterns of metabolic acidosis were defined using the ratio: delta AG/delta TCO2 where delta AG is the increment in plasma anion gap above normal and delta TCO2 the decrement in plasma bicarbonate below normal. The group as a whole showed a mixed hyperchloremic and high anion gap pattern with a mean delta AG/delta TCO2 ratio of 53.3 +/- 7.1%. The individual distribution of patterns ranged from a pure hyperchloremic acidosis (24%) to a pure high anion gap acidosis (30%) with the mixed pattern being the most frequent (46%). An inverse correlation between the TCO2 change (y) during the dialysis procedure and the TCO2 (x) prevailing at the start of dialysis was found by linear regression analysis: y = -0.51x + 11, r = -0.54, p less than 0.01. Thus, before acetate conversion to bicarbonate was fully completed, patients gained bicarbonate during dialysis if TCO2 was less than 21 mEq/l and lost it when the pre-dialysis TCO2 was above this level. On average, the delta AG was reduced to a greater extent than the delta TCO2 so that the delta AG/delta TCO2 ratio fell significantly (from 53 +/- 7.1 to 11 +/- 8.8%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The enzyme levels of the two patient groups were similar and were significantly higher than those of the volunteer group. The ratio of pancreatic to salivary amylase was similar in all three groups. Anuric patients in both dialysis groups had higher enzyme levels than those with residual urine output. Linear regression analysis was done to attempt to identify factors which were good predictors of enzyme levels. Although no such factors were found in the hemodialysis group, in the CAPD group there were significant correlations between the degree of azotemia and the magnitude of enzyme elevations. Further studies are needed to determine the relative importance of oversecretion and underexcretion in the genesis of the amylase and lipase elevations found in dialysis patients.\r"

It was essential to achieve adequate output with the lowest possible speed in order to minimize traumatic hemolysis. The result was a spindle pump with three windings in a U-shaped housing driven by an electric motor. Many tests were necessary to establish a prototype. The spindle was completely redesigned several times to reach an acceptable volume output and corresponding pressure output. In animal experiments this final prototype working as a LVAD, with a speed of 5400 RPM circulates 4 liters/min against BP of 110 mmHg. The hemolysis rate has been low in acute and survival experiments (27 hours up to now), and is between 25 and 30 mg/100 ml of free hemoglobin, thus within the normal range.\r"

  ".U": "89079346\r", 
  ".W": "Dynamic cardiomyoplasty involves the use of an electrically stimulated skeletal muscle wrapped around part of the heart to restore or augment myocardial contractility. In our approach, a Latissimus Dorsi muscle flap (LDMF) is transferred to the heart via a partial resection of the second rib, and sutured around the ventricles. The muscle flap is stimulated in synchrony with the heart contractions with bursts of impulses delivered by a \"Cardio-Myostimulator\" implantable pulse generator via intramuscular electrodes. The object of this study was to identify features of muscle stimulation and to measure the efficacy of L.D. cardiomyoplasty in increasing cardiac output, using an ultrasonic Doppler technique. This report shows the results obtained for goats in which such procedures were performed. Ultrasonic measurements were recorded at the time of cardiomyoplasty and 3-6 months later, during which period the muscle was put progressively into use by slowly increasing the burst frequency content, number of pulses as well as the heart-muscle contraction ratio (3:1, 2:1, 1:1). This postoperative muscle stimulation protocol takes into account the delay of gradual conversion of fast-twitch glycolytic muscular fibers into slow-twitch oxidative, fatigue-resistant fibers, as well as the healing time after cardiomyoplasty required for the muscle flap to recover collateral blood circulation and to adhere to the heart. Results show that synchronous burst stimulation of the muscle flap increases the blood peak velocity in the descending aorta (+36 +/- 8%) and increases the left ventricular stroke volume (+70 +/- 14%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In these experiments, three types of TAH (TNS-BRNO II, VII, and Rostock) were used. The levels of aldosterone were already high before the surgery and during the entire pumping period, which indicates the development of secondary aldosteronism. The study deals with the mechanisms that participate in the development of aldosteronism in each phase of the experiment with the TAH.\r"

Several hardware alarm systems have been incorporated for battery-down, and short-run of the pumps. Software alarm systems for overflow or underflow of the AD converter, empty bags, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, abnormal values of parameters, and excessive insulin infusion have also been built into the system. The software noise filter was effective in eliminating superimposed artificial noises and the noises induced by muscle exercise. Sudden changes in sensor output during glycemic control of diabetics due to short circuit, or disconnection of the sensor lead, were detected as overflow or underflow of the AD converter. A gradual change in the sensor output was heralded by the hyper- or hypoglycemia alarm sound. These data indicated that the fail-safe system built into the wearable artificial endocrine pancreas is useful for the long-term glycemic control of diabetics.\r"

Using a specially designed 7F catheter 22 nitinol (TiNi) wire prostheses (I.D. 5 mm; 0.25 mm thickness) were torsion reduced in diameter and inserted under fluoroscopy into both carotid (n = 2) and iliac-femoral arteries (n = 20) of dogs. Aspirin (650 mg BID) and Persantin (200 mg BID) were given for only 30 days postoperatively. Angiography of all rings at 1, 6, 12 months exhibited excellent biocompatibility and long term patency 91% (20/22) as reported in Trans ASAIO 32:30, 1986. Four rings inserted in the right and left common iliac arteries and femoral artery were followed for up to 2 years and exhibited 100% patency. Angiography demonstrated that the anchorage of the prostheses was stable and the lumen was uniformly covered by a thin neointimal layer of endothelial like cells. The prostheses were patent with no evidence of thrombosis or inflammation. In view of the problem of recurrent stenosis occurring during the healing period after balloon angioplasty (PTA or PTCA), this approach may lead to a new means of clinical intervention in atherosclerosis.\r"

Four of nine patients with thyroid abnormality also had evidence of gastric autoimmunity. Of the patients 94% smoked at the onset of pustulosis palmoplantaris compared with 33% in age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The prevalence of thyroid disease in women with pustulosis palmoplantaris was significantly higher than in a comparable population sample of women from the same geographic region. We conclude that patients with pustulosis palmoplantaris should be screened for thyroid disease.\r"

The mean age of the patients was 22.7 years, and 42 patients (56%) were between 15 and 24 years of age. This finding shows that the affected patients are not predominantly infants, as has been reported up to now. Of these patients 5 had one recurrence, two had two recurrences, and one had three recurrences.

Allowing for age and sex, the strongest risk factors for skin cancer and solar keratoses were fair skin, as assessed by a dermatologist, and clinical signs of solar damage such as solar lentigines, facial telangiectasia, and actinic elastosis of the neck. Associations with self-reported tendencies toward sunburn, frequent painful sunburns, occupational sun exposure, and a previous history of skin cancer were confirmed.\r"

  ".W": "Many standardized methods are available with which to evaluate the reading ease and comprehensibility of written material. Techniques depend on mechanical analysis of sentence length, multiple prepositional phrases, direct phraseology, and arrangement of printed materials on the page. Those techniques were used to analyze a pamphlet designed for patient education by the American Academy of Dermatology. The pamphlet scored a reading ease grade of 45, corresponding to what is considered difficult reading and at a level commonly found in academic journals. We rewrote the pamphlet and increased its reading ease score to 62.4, corresponding to material that appears in standard digest-type magazines. We gave both versions of the pamphlet to a group of first-year medical students and to a group of middle-class patients from a dermatology practice. In both groups the modified version led to greater understanding of the written material. We conclude that the usefulness of patient education materials now being distributed by dermatologists could be significantly improved by being rewritten according to well-recognized formulas.\r"

The groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, pulmonary function at baseline, or any other variable. They were monitored at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes by use of a clinical score, oxygen saturation, and pulmonary function tests. At the end of the study, albuterol was administered to assess residual bronchoconstriction. Clinical scores improved significantly after treatment in all groups at all times compared with baseline. The greatest improvement in FEV1 was seen in the patients treated with ipratropium/fenoterol, whether considered as absolute change, change in percent predicted, or percent change from baseline. Ipratropium/fenoterol was significantly better than fenoterol alone only when considered as percent change from baseline. Improvement in flow at mid and low lung volumes was significantly greater for the ipratropium/fenoterol combination than for ipratropium alone; no significant differences were noted between ipratropium/fenoterol and fenoterol for flow at mid and low lung volumes. Treatment with albuterol did not significantly improve pulmonary function in the groups receiving ipratropium/fenoterol or fenoterol alone, but it did increase flow at all lung volumes in the group receiving ipratropium alone. No patient complained spontaneously of any adverse reactions, and no clinically significant changes in heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressures occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 15 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and without concomitant viral or bacterial infections, chemotaxis, superoxide-anion (O2-) generation, and beta-glucuronidase release of purified monocytes (MO) and neutrophils (PMN) were determined. Defined receptor-dependent stimulators (i.e., N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, C5a, and leukotriene B4, as well as native and opsonized zymosan particles) were used for phagocyte stimulation. PMN functional activities in response to the stimuli tested were found to be normal in patients with AD and without infections. MO from these patients revealed a slight enhancement of O2- production after stimulation with opsonized zymosan and a small increase of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced chemotaxis. Other MO functions tested were within the normal range. However, investigations of MO and PMN functions during the course of concomitant bacterial infections of three patients with AD demonstrated striking alterations of cellular responsiveness. These changes ranged from enhanced to decreased phagocyte functions, depending on the activity of the infectious disorder. Chemotaxis of PMN and MO was depressed around the third day after onset of the infectious disease. In the beginning of infection, there was a decreased O2- generation and beta-glucuronidase release in PMNs. In MOs, both parameters were enhanced. The results of these investigations provide evidence that functional abnormalities of phagocytes observed in patients with AD are sequelae of concomitant skin infections and not signs of an intrinsic defect present in MOs and PMNs.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioids are released during exercise and have been demonstrated to induce mast cell degranulation when they are administered intradermally. Thus, these peptides may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB). However, in two previous studies, intravenous naloxone did not provide significant protection from EIB. To determine if these failures were due to inadequate dosage (pharmacokinetic failure) or lack of an inherent pharmacologic effect (pharmacodynamic failure), the present study was conducted with nalmefene (Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Miami, Fla.), a slowly metabolized, orally bioavailable opiate antagonist, with 30 times the potency of naloxone. Ten subjects with mild intermittent asthma and a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in FEV1 after a standardized exercise test were studied. nalmefene, 20 mg, and identically appearing placebo tablets were administered orally in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design 2 hours before bronchoprovocation. Treadmill exercise was performed for 6 minutes at a minute ventilation of 55% to 66% of the calculated maximum voluntary ventilation and not exceeding 75% to 85% maximal heart rate for age. Spirometry was performed before and 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 minutes after exercise. The mean decrease in FEV1 after exercise was 28.6 +/- 4.5% with placebo and 30.3 +/- 4.5% with Nalmefene (p = 0.6; beta = 0.04 for a 15% difference). Thus, we conclude that narcotic antagonists do not alter airway reactivity to exercise. In addition, these data suggest that endogenous opioids probably do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of EIB.\r"

Seven healthy subjects were tested with placebo and drug conditions on separate days in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Mean theophylline levels of 15 +/- 2 mg/L SD were maintained by constant intravenous infusion. Strength of the diaphragm was measured as maximum inspiratory pressure. Strength of the biceps and quadriceps were measured isometrically during arm flexion (90 degrees) and leg extension (115 degrees) against an electronic load cell. Fatigue was measured as the decrease in tension during a 30-second contraction and during a 6-minute period of alternating 5-second maximal contraction and 5-second rest. Therapeutic levels of theophylline had no effect on strength or fatigability during a maximal contraction in any muscle group studied.\r"

Our main knowledge of the cellular response to allergen in sensitized individuals has been derived from allergen-challenge models. To explore the dynamics of the cellular response during the actual disease, patients with a strictly seasonal allergic rhinitis were studied during natural allergen exposure. Ten patients suffering from an isolated birch-pollen allergy were followed from a symptom-free state before, during, and to the height of the birch-pollen season. Repeated parallel cell samplings from the nasal mucosa were performed with cytologic imprints on plastic strips, nasal lavages with the recovery of the cells in the lavage fluid with cytocentrifugation on object slides for cytologic study, and scrapings from the nasal surface with a curette for histologic and ultrastructural evaluation. The histamine content was determined in lavage fluid and cell pellets. The tosyl-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl esterase activity of the nasal lavage fluid was also determined as a biochemical marker of the allergic inflammatory reaction. The birch-pollen season was moderate in terms of pollen counts, and this resulted in mild to moderate nasal symptoms that ran parallel to the birch-pollen counts. The total number of cells recovered in the lavage fluid was 1.2 +/- 0.4 (SEM) x 10(6) before and 3.2 +/- 2.0 per 10(6) cells (not significant) during pollen exposure. Most cells were neutrophils and mononuclear cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Basidiomycetes, a complex and common group of fungi, which include mushrooms, rusts, smuts, brackets, and puffballs, have not been well studied. Although basidiospores can be present in high atmospheric concentrations, little is known of their aeroallergen potential. To examine this question, we performed skin prick and RASTs in 33 adult residents of Washington State using a panel of 15 common inhalant allergents that included four Fungi Imperfecti and 15 basidiospore extracts. Thirty-one of 33 (94%) subjects had positive immediate reactions to two or more common inhalants. Nine of 33 (27%) subjects responded to at least one Fungi Imperfecti; reactions were most common to Aspergillus sp. (21%), and least common to Penicillium sp., which were positive in 6%. Positive responses to basidiospore extracts were observed in 10 of 33 (30%) subjects. The prevalence of basidiospore reactivity was similar to that of Fungi Imperfecti, ranging from 18% for Scleroderma sp. to 6% for four different spore extracts. These results demonstrate that a significant number of subjects with respiratory allergies have skin test reactivity to basidiospore extracts, suggesting that these spores could be important aeroallergens in the Pacific Northwest.\r"

We evaluated three individuals with work-related symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, and angioedema on exposure to the insect. Prick skin tests with extracts prepared from the larval, pupal, and adult life stages were positive in all three patients. Specific IgE antibodies to these extracts were demonstrated by RAST or radioimmunoassay. RAST and radioimmunoassay inhibition confirmed the specificity of IgE binding and further demonstrated immunologic cross-reactivity between the three life stages. Peripheral blood leukocytes from two of the individuals demonstrated significant histamine release when they were compared with cells from nonexposed atopic and normal control subjects. The proteins in the extracts of each life stage were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More than 30 protein bands were detected in each of the extracts; however, the patterns of separation were different for each life stage. After immunoblotting and autoradiography, IgE-binding proteins were recognized by sera from all three individuals in the larval extract at 90 kilodaltons (kd), in the pupal extract at 90, 64, and 38 kd, and in the adult extract at 84 kd. Additionally, several other proteins were identified as being allergenic in some of the patients. We conclude that these three patients developed IgE-mediated sensitivity to A. diaperinus antigens as the result of occupational exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first description of sensitivity to this grain beetle.\r"

Preculture of HNK-1+ lymphocytes with PRD (10(-6) to 10(-8) mol/L) for 72 hours resulted in a significant reduction of cytotoxic functions. When peripheral blood lymphocytes were first precultured with PRD and then separated into HNK-1+ and HNK-1- subpopulations, both could suppress the target binding and lytic activities of fresh large granular lymphocytes with the HNK-1+ cells demonstrating greater inhibition than the HNK-1- cells. Moreover, PRD-treated cells demonstrated greater suppression of target binding and cytotoxicity than identical subpopulations cultured without PRD. Culture supernatants of lymphocytes treated with 10(-6) to 10(-9) mol/L concentrations of PRD contain PRD-induced soluble suppressor factor that significantly inhibited the natural killer activity of allogeneic lymphocytes against different targets. PRD-induced soluble suppressor factor was not cytotoxic itself, and suppression was evident at various effector-to-target cell ratios. These studies indicate that in addition to being directly immunosuppressive, corticosteroids may also induce immunoregulatory lymphocytes to secrete a suppressive lymphokine.\r"

The cells in NS of 117 positive immediate nasal responses (INRs) and in 68 negative INRs, correlating with history and skin tests, and in 102 control challenges with phosphate-buffered saline were stained by modified May-Grunwald-Giemsa, toluidine blue, and Hansel's method. The positive INR was accompanied by significant changes in the count of eosinophils (increase followed by decrease) in 67% of neutrophils (decrease followed by increase) in 40%, goblet cells (increase followed by decrease) in 41%, and basophils (decrease) in 13% of the NSs. No significant changes in the count of other types of cells in the NSs were recorded during most of the cases of INR. No significant changes in the count of individual cell types in NSs were found during most cases of negative INR. During the phosphate-buffered saline control challenges, the individual cell types appeared irregularly, and no significant changes in their count were recorded in any patient. The cytologic examination of NS, evoked by allergen, appears therefore to be a valuable supplementary diagnostic parameter for nasal allergy. The repeated counting of eosinophils in NS, before and after allergen challenge, appears to be the best way to discriminate between positive and negative nasal responses, since the eosinophils demonstrated significant changes in their count during 67% of the positive and only 11% of the negative INRs.\r"

  ".W": "House dust mites of the species Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt) represent one of the major allergens inducing asthma. However, a strict allergy to Dpt is not always observed in Dpt-allergic patients, since nonallergic and other allergic triggering factors often coexist. It was suggested that specific immunotherapy with house dust-mite extracts is more effective in children than in adults. A controlled study was undertaken in 215 Dpt-allergic patients with asthma ranging in age from 3 to 72 years (mean +/- SD, 28.2 +/- 10.9 years) to investigate parameters that might predict the efficacy of specific immunotherapy before it is started; 171 patients received a rush immunotherapy protocol with a standardized Dpt extract and, subsequently, maintenance injections with 3000 BU of this extract, and 44 patients served as a control group. Before immunotherapy, all patients had a complete evaluation of the severity of asthma by symptom-medication scores and a pulmonary function test, as well as a study of other triggering factors by checking on seasonal and perennial allergens, sinusitis, and other possible causes, such as aspirin intolerance; 196 patients were investigated between 9 and 12 months after the onset of the survey by means of pulmonary function tests and symptom-medication scores. Medications were adapted according to peak flow rates. It was observed that patients with chronic sinusitis, and/or aspirin intolerance, and/or other perennial allergies did not benefit from specific immunotherapy; therefore, the treatment of a major etiologic factor did not demonstrate improvement in the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Crude extracts of Pleurotus ostreatus spores obtained from a single local source were fractionated by gel filtration to resolve the allergenic components. The fraction pool corresponding to 10.5 to 25 kd molecular weight contained allergenic activity as demonstrated by both RAST and skin testing. Similar results were obtained with extracts from spores that originated in four other areas and with extracts prepared from P. sajor-caju spores obtained from commercially produced caps. The RAST-active fraction was further separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). HIC fraction pools were assayed for allergen(s) by RAST inhibition and immunoblotting of isoelectric focused polyacrylamide gels. RAST-inhibition data indicated that the allergen(s) was reversibly bound to the HIC column, eluting with 2, 1, and 0.15 mol/L of buffered salt solutions. After electrofocusing, these fractions yielded 15, 12, and 11 Coomassie brilliant blue-staining bands, respectively. IgE binding occurred with 7, 8, and 6 of these bands, as revealed by radiostaining of the immunoblots. These procedures help identify P. ostreatus spore allergens and allow a greater degree of standardization in the preparation of allergen extracts from basidiospores for use in diagnosis and therapy of fungal allergy.\r"

Degranulation, defined as dissolution of granule contents and swelling in at least 20% of secretory granules of mast cells was observed in one third of mast cells at 5 minutes and in nearly two thirds of mast cells at 10 to 15 minutes, but was absent in biopsy specimens of control subjects. Anaphylactic degranulation was characterized by extensive fusion of granules to form degranulation channels, fusion of channels with the cell membrane to form large pores, and exocytosis of amorphous or fibrillar granule matrix into the connective tissue. Extruded secretory granules of skin mast cells persist for at least 15 minutes in the connective tissues, in apparent contrast to the process of in vivo degranulation in nasal and lung mast cells.\r"

Stresses associated with the care of AIDS patients are generated by the medical complexities of the disease, by the stigma attached to the disease and the patients affected, and by the often overwhelming psychosocial support requirements. These stresses and concerns about the cost of AIDS care have contributed to apprehension about AIDS involvement on the part of many in the health care system. This paper addresses these concerns from the perspective of San Francisco General Hospital, which has developed what many consider to be a model of care in which comprehensive medical management is combined with cost effectiveness in a setting where much of the care is conducted in an outpatient and community-based setting.\r"

Bloodstains from 13 animal species were tested and found to be negative for human blood. A minimum volume of 0.8 microL of fresh blood is required to produce sufficient stain for successful testing. Bloodstains prepared from newborn and sickle-cell bloods were determined to be human. Bloodstains ranging in age from 1 month to 6 years which had been maintained desiccated at 20 to 25 degrees C were also successfully tested. Positive results were obtained on human bloodstains stored at 24 degrees C with relative humidity ranging from 0 to 98% for a period of 3 weeks. Absolute counts per minute (CPM) decreased with increased humidity. Human bloodstains exposed to bacterial contamination (gram positive or negative species) under humid conditions for 2 weeks also tested positive. Bacterial contamination caused a decrease in CPM, but insufficient to result in an erroneous conclusion as to species of origin. Positive results were also obtained on human bloodstains stored for 6 weeks at various temperatures ranging from -16 to 37 degrees C. No significant decreases in CPM were noted for any of the temperature conditions described.\r"

  ".W": "Suicide is an important public health problem for which we have an inadequate public health database. In the United States, decisions about whether deaths are listed as suicides on death certificates are usually made by a coroner or medical examiner. These certification decisions are frequently marked by a lack of consistency and clarity, and laws and procedures for guiding these decisions vary from state to state and even from county to county. Without explicit criteria to aid in this decision making, coroners or medical examiners may be more susceptible to pressures from families or communities not to certify specific deaths as suicide. In addition, coroners or medical examiners may certify similar deaths differently at different times. The degree to which suicides may be underreported or misclassified is unknown. This makes it impossible to estimate accurately the number of deaths by suicide, to identify risk factors, or to plan and evaluate preventive interventions. To remedy these problems, a working group representing coroners, medical examiners, statisticians, and public health agencies developed operational criteria to assist in the determination of suicide. These criteria are based on a definition of suicide as \"death arising from an act inflicted upon oneself with the intent to kill oneself.\" The purpose of these criteria is to improve the validity and reliability of suicide statistics by: (1) promoting consistent and uniform classifications; (2) making the criteria for decision making in death certification explicit; (3) increasing the amount of information used in decision making; (4) aiding certifiers in exercising their professional judgment; and (5) establishing common standards of practice for the determination of suicide.\r"

GDH activity was reproducible to within 10% in leukocyte pellets stored at -70 degrees C for up to 9 months, and did not vary with sex or age in control subjects. There was marked variation in the relative proportions of heat stable and heat labile forms of GDH between control subjects and on repeated assay in the same subject. Total leukocyte GDH activity was similar in normal subjects and neurological controls. Mean total GDH activity was reduced in all patient groups by between 15 to 29% compared with controls. Fourteen patients had total GDH activity below 50% of the control mean, but low values were not specific for any one disease (five had ataxic disorders, four Parkinson's disease, three multiple system atrophy, one juvenile Parkinsonism, and one dystonia-Parkinsonism). The heat labile fraction of GDH represented about 20% of total activity in control subjects, and 27% in the patients with reduced total GDH activity. Thus low GDH activity was not disease-specific in this study, and the heat-labile GDH fraction was not selectively affected. \"Reduced\" leucocyte GDH activity in some patients may represent no more than the lower end of a normal distribution.\r"

  ".W": "A decreased concentration of vasopressin (AVP) in the plasma of patients with Alzheimer's disease has been shown recently and suggests damage to hypothalamic neurosecretory cells. To verify this, osmolar and hypotension (sodium nitroprusside) stimulations on AVP release were applied. The effect of metoclopramide, a powerful stimulator of AVP, was also assessed. Patients with Alzheimer's disease released AVP normally after hypotension. However, AVP response to osmotic stimulation was altered in eight out of 10 patients, owing to low osmoreceptor sensitivity and/or high threshold. Metoclopramide increased AVP in controls but not in patients. Normal AVP response to hypotension in patients with Alzheimer's disease makes it unlikely that there is a significant anatomical loss or damage of hypothalamic neurosecretory cells. Alterations in osmoreceptor function and AVP unresponsiveness to metoclopramide point to damage in the control of AVP release in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Nine patients reported improvement in head position and control, which was confirmed in seven cases by clinical assessment and \"blind\" videotape ratings before and 6 weeks after injection. Five patients who had pain reported relief. Seven patients had mild transient dysphagia after injection; two who were given a more concentrated solution of the toxin developed more severe dysphagia, but this also recovered. Other minor transient side effects included weakness of the voice and local pain. The beneficial effects of botulinum toxin injections lasted some 2 to 3 months. A slight reduction in the total dose of toxin injected avoided the main side effects, and this method of treatment appears to offer successful control of head position and pain in the majority of patients with torticollis.\r"

The patients performed wrist flexion-extension movements or movements about the shoulder with or without visual guidance. Different types of mechanical loads were applied to oppose the wrist movements. The tremor was greatest when the patients used visual cues to guide movements. Kinetic tremor was substantially suppressed during performance of similar movements that were not guided directly by vision. Viscous loads suppressed the tremor nearly linearly, whereas constant loads opposing extension enhanced the tremor. The postural tremor was not observed during isometric contractions. These results support the view that processing of visual information contributes to the impairment of movement in disorders with cerebellar-type tremor and that certain somaesthetic inputs can selectively influence the generation of postural tremor.\r"

  ".U": "89080745\r", 
  ".W": "The nature and organisation of anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) associated with the early phase of a voluntary upper limb movement were studied. Upper limb elevations, performed at maximal velocity, were studied according to three conditions: bilateral flexions (BF) and unilateral flexions without and with an additional inertia (respectively OUF and IUF). Activities of the anterior part of the deltoid (DA) and of main muscles of the lower limbs, pelvis, trunk and scapular girdle were recorded by surface electromyography. Miniature-accelerometers enabled the recording of the tangential acceleration of the arm at wrist level (Aw) and the antero-posterior accelerations of various body links. Systematic investigations allow a precise description of the segmental phenomena which precede the onset of the voluntary movement. Before the activation of the anterior deltoid, a sequence of EMG modifications occurred in muscles of lower limbs, pelvis and trunk. The onset of Aw was preceded by anticipatory local accelerations of all the body links. Anticipatory EMG activities and local accelerations were organised according to patterns which were specific to the forthcoming voluntary movement. By comparing anticipatory EMG activities with anticipatory local accelerations, the nature of anticipatory postural movements can be determined. They appear to counteract the disturbing effects of the forthcoming voluntary movement. Because of their reproducibility and specificity, the anticipatory postural movements can be considered as preprogrammed. Postural adjustments and voluntary movement appear to be parts of the same motor program. Anticipatory postural movements should result from muscular functional synergies selected from a pre-evaluation of the perturbative aspects of the forthcoming movement.\r"

Lowering total serum cholesterol by 4%, smoking by 15%, and diastolic blood pressure by 3% for the whole cohort would be expected to reduce the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction by at least 13% and coronary heart disease deaths by at least 18%. Lowering serum cholesterol by 34%, diastolic blood pressure to 90 mmHg, and reducing smoking by 20% in the subset of the population with all three risk factors in the highest quartile would result in a 6-8% reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction and a 2-9% reduction in deaths from coronary heart disease in these cohorts. These data demonstrate that in populations with a relatively high incidence of heart disease, treating the entire population will produce larger effects than focusing only on high-risk populations.\r"

After a year of planning and protocol development, 5,116 black and white women and men, age 18-30 years, were recruited and examined in four urban areas: Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Oakland, California. The initial examination included carefully standardized measurements of major risk factors as well as assessments of psychosocial, dietary, and exercise-related characteristics that might influence them, or that might be independent risk factors. This report presents the recruitment and examination methods as well as the mean levels of blood pressure, total plasma cholesterol, height, weight and body mass index, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking by age, sex, race and educational level. Compared to recent national samples, smoking is less prevalent in CARDIA participants, and weight tends to be greater. Cholesterol levels are representative and somewhat lower blood pressures in CARDIA are probably, at least in part, due to differences in measurement methods. Especially noteworthy among several differences in risk factor levels by demographic subgroup, were a higher body mass index among black than white women and much higher prevalence of cigarette smoking among persons with no more than a high school education than among those with more education.\r"

  ".W": "A high intake of olive oil has produced high levels of high-density and low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in short-term dietary trials. To investigate long-term effects of olive oil we have studied the diet and serum lipids of boys in Crete, where a high olive oil consumption is the norm. Seventy-six healthy rural Cretan boys aged 7-9 years were studied. The diet was assessed by a 2-day dietary recall. Blood was collected according to a standardized protocol and sera were analyzed in a rigidly standardized laboratory. The mean daily intake of energy was 11.0 MJ (2629 kcal). The intake of fat (45.0% of energy) and oleic acid (27.2% of energy) was high, and that of saturated fat low (10.0% of energy), reflecting a high consumption of olive oil. The high consumption of olive oil was confirmed by a high proportion of oleic-acid (27.1%) in serum cholesteryl fatty acids. Mean concentration of serum total cholesterol was 4.42 mmol l-1 (171 mg dl-1), of HDL-cholesterol 1.40 mmol l-1 (54 mg dl-1), of serum triglycerides 0.59 mmol l-1 (52 mg dl-1), of apo-AI 1210 mg l-1 and of LDL apo-B 798 mg l-1. The body mass index of the Cretan boys (18.2 kg m-2) was on average 2 kg m-2 higher than that of boys from other countries. Contrary to our expectation, the Cretan boys did not show a more favourable serum lipoprotein pattern than boys from more westernized countries studied previously using the same protocol. Our hypothesis that a typical, olive-oil-rich Cretan diet causes a relatively high HDL- to total cholesterol ratio is not supported by the present findings.\r"

Sch 37224 was, therefore, tested in allergic sheep (n = 6) with documented immediate and late airway responses and AHR to inhaled Ascaris suum antigen. For these studies, base-line airway dose-response curves to histamine and carbachol were determined on the same day. The sheep were challenged 1 to 2 days later with Ascaris suum antigen, once after placebo treatment and once after 10 mg/kg of Sch 37224, administered orally 18 and 2 hr before challenge (total dose, 20 mg/kg). Airway dose-response curves were subsequently performed 24 hr after antigen challenge. In the placebo trial, antigen challenge caused significant peak immediate and peak late increases over base line in specific lung resistance (SRL) of 286 +/- 51 and 196 +/- 29%, respectively. SRL returned to baseline values 24 hr later, but the sheep had AHR to both histamine and carbachol as indicated by 2.6- and 3.1-fold increases in the slopes of the dose-response curves (P less than .05). Sch 37224 treatment reduced the peak immediate and peak late increases in SRL to 128 +/- 32 and 43 +/- 17%, respectively (both P less than .05 vs. placebo).

We used isolated mouse brain membranes to test whether Ro 15-4513 would reduce the effects of ethanol on membrane fluidity, voltage-dependent calcium channels, microsomal calcium release or binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate. None of these actions of ethanol were altered by Ro 15-4513. The enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated chloride flux produced by ethanol or pentobarbital was antagonized partially by Ro 15-4513. Another inverse agonist, FG 7142, was more effective than Ro 15-4513 as an antagonist of ethanol actions on chloride flux. These results demonstrate that the ethanol antagonist action of Ro 15-4513 is specific for GABA-activated chloride flux and does not extend to other neurochemical actions of ethanol. The inverse agonist action (i.e., inhibition of GABA-activated chloride flux tested in the absence of ethanol) of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 was revealed by pretreatment of mice in vivo with ethanol. This raises the possibility that ethanol exposure increases the inverse agonist actions of Ro 15-4513 and related drugs and that these inverse agonist actions contribute to the ethanol antagonism observed in vivo and in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, has been reported to antagonize the ataxic effects of ethanol. The present study investigates the Ro 15-4513 sensitivity of rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons to the depressant effects of locally applied ethanol. Local applications of ethanol by pressure ejection from multibarrel micropipettes caused reversible and dose-dependent depressions of the neuronal firing rates of single cerebellar Purkinje neurons. The ethanol-induced depressions could be antagonized by local applications of Ro 15-4513 applied from another barrel of the same micropipette. This antagonism was not competitive, suggesting that Ro 15-4513 does not interfere directly with the initial step of the ethanol mechanism of action. A beta-carboline inverse agonist, FG 7142, was more efficacious than Ro 15-4513 for antagonizing the ethanol-induced depressions, but appeared to be less potent. Recovery of ethanol-induced depressions of Purkinje neurons firing rates after Ro 15-4513 antagonism was not usually observed for 1 hr or more after the antagonist application. In contrast to ethanol effects, qualitatively similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced depressions of these same neurons were not antagonized by the doses of Ro 15-4513 used. We conclude that the electrophysiological depressant effects of ethanol on cerebellar neuronal activity can be antagonized by the benzodiazepine inverse agonists, Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142.\r"

The alpha-1 receptor population comprised a relatively small portion of the total adrenergic receptors, 14.6 +/- 1.9%. However, in failing human ventricular myocardium the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor population constituted a much greater portion, 27.3 +/- 2.1% (P less than .01). The reason for the increased proportion of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors was not that the total concentration of alpha-1 receptors was increased, but instead was due to selective down-regulation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor population. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors behaved similarly to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the failing human heart, and were increased in proportion and unchanged in total number. Additionally, the ability of alpha-1 stimulation to increase the incorporation of label from [3H]inositol into inositol phosphates was examined in tissue homogenates. Maximal doses of norepinephrine produced only marginal stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, in contrast to a more substantial response produced by muscarinic stimulation. We conclude that human ventricular myocardium contains alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that 1) are of relatively low density, 2) are unchanged in density by heart failure and 3) mediate relatively low-level stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.\r"

The order of potency for cannabinoid-induced effects was spontaneous activity greater than antinociception greater than hypothermia greater than or equal to catalepsy. Levonantradol was active between 0.123 to 1.5 mg/kg, whereas dextronantradol, its (+)-enantiomer was inactive.

We assessed the plasma elimination and pulmonary content of BLM in C57Bl/6N and BALB/c mice treated with a single dose of [3H]BLM (80 mg/kg i.v.) to determine whether these murine strains show corresponding differences in BLM pharmacokinetics and pulmonary disposition after systemic administration of the drug. Serial blood samples were obtained from each animal and lungs were collected after pulmonary lavage or vascular perfusion with saline. Administration of BLM (80 mg/kg i.v.) produced significant elevations in lung hydroxyproline (35%) in C57Bl/6N but not in BALB/c mice. In contrast, BALB/c mice were more sensitive to pulmonary fibrosis induced with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg i.p.) compared to C57Bl/6N mice, indicating that strain sensitivity to pulmonary fibrosis is drug specific in these mice. BLM showed first order plasma elimination kinetics over 30 min in both strains with a shorter half-life in the sensitive strain (9.6 +/- 0.3 min in C57Bl/6N vs. 12.7 +/- 1.9 min in BALB/c). Plasma elimination deviated from first order kinetics after 30 min in both strains and plasma levels of BLM were up to 2-fold higher in the resistant strain over a 3-hr time course. Radioactivity in saline-perfused lungs was also significantly higher (1.5-2-fold) in BALB/c mice for least 1 hr after BLM injection. A similar fraction of the total lung radioactivity (approximately 80%) was recovered from both strains by pulmonary lavage, suggesting that BLM enters the alveolar spaces relatively freely in each strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both P1-purinoceptor agonists, such as 2-chloroadenosine, and P2-purinoceptor agonists, such as beta,gamma-methylene ATP, produced concentration-dependent contractions. Responses to 2-chloroadenosine were antagonized by the P1-receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline and those to beta,gamma-methylene ATP by the P2-receptor antagonist 3'-O-3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl ATP. Significant antagonism of responses to ATP occurred only with combined treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline and 3'-O-3-[4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl ATP. Responses to both adenosine and ATP were potentiated significantly in the presence of the adenosine uptake blocker S-p-nitrobenzyl-6-thioguanosine. These results indicate the presence of both P1- and P2-receptors in the myometrium and that activation of either receptor leads to contraction. Additional studies with other adenosine analogs, such as 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamine adenosine, R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, S-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine and N6-cyclohexyladenosine, indicate that the P1-receptor is of the A1 subtype.\r"

In vitro, SCH39166 (Ki = 3.6 nM) inhibited the binding of [3H]SCH23390 (a D1 specific compound) and blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (Ki = 9.1 nM); in contrast the Ki for SCH39166 to displace [3H]spiperone (D2) was greater than 1 microM and its Ki vs. [3H]-ketanserin (5-hydroxytryptamine2) binding was greater than 300 nM. In vivo, SCH39166 inhibited both rat and squirrel monkey conditioned avoidance responding (minimal effective dose = 10 and 1.78 mg/kg p.o., respectively) and had a duration of at least 6 hr in both species. In addition, SCH39166 antagonized apomorphine-induced stereotypy in rats (minimal effective dose = 10 mg/kg p.o.). These in vivo actions of SCH39166 are similar to the activity of typical dopamine antagonists. However, in contrast to D2-selective antagonists, SCH39166 failed to increase plasma prolactin levels, did not block apomorphine-induced emesis in the dog and had minimal effects on the striatal levels of homovanillic acid or dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Furthermore, although immobility was seen after p.o. administration of SCH39166 using the inclined screen test, the drug did not cause catalepsy at doses up to 10 times its minimal effective dose in the rat conditioned avoidance response test. Additionally, SCH39166 inhibited apomorphine-induced climbing at lower doses than it inhibited apomorphine-induced sniffing in mice. The results from these latter two tests suggest that SCH39166 may have a reduced liability to produce extrapyramidal side effects. Therefore, based on this profile of activity, SCH39166 is a selective D1 dopamine receptor antagonist both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, because this compound is longer acting in the primate than previously available D1 antagonists, it has potential utility as a clinically useful drug.\r"

  ".W": "The development of selective tolerance, that is, a loss in the ability of an agonist to exert an effect without concomitant loss in the ability of an agonist which acts through another receptor type to similarly lose its effectiveness, has provided supporting evidence for the existence of multiple opioid receptor types in brain and peripheral tissues. In brain, this phenomenon has generally been demonstrated for agonists which produce different physiological effects. In this study, we describe selective tolerance at two opioid receptor types which converge upon a single function. The effects of chronic treatment for 6 days with the mu agonist morphine (1.7 mg/kg/hr) and the kappa agonist U50, 488H (300 micrograms/kg/hr) on the ability of mu and kappa opioid agonists to inhibit the stimulated release of [3H]norepinephrine from slices of guinea pig cortex were investigated. Mu, delta and kappa selective agonists have been shown previously to be capable of regulating the stimulated release of norepinephrine. Chronic administration of morphine resulted in a diminution in the ability of the mu agonists Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N(Me)Phe-Gly-ol, morphine and etorphine, but not of U50, 488H, to inhibit the stimulated release of [3H]norepinephrine. Conversely, chronic U50, 488H infusion decreased the ability of U50, 488H to inhibit release, with no change in the effectiveness of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N(Me)Phe-Gly-ol. The degree of tolerance observed for mu agonists in tissue from morphinized animals is discussed with regard to their efficacy and selectivity.\r"

Fluid-restricted rats were injected with drug or saline and then given access to a 0.25% saccharin solution for 30 min. When rats received a drug trial, saccharin consumption was followed by an injection of LiCl (1.8 mEq/kg i.p.), whereas on saline trials saccharin consumption was followed by a second injection of saline instead of LiCl. Rats were trained using injections of either 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), an agonist selective for the 5-HT1A receptor, or 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (0.8 mg/kg i.p.), an agonist selective for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, as the drug stimuli. Acquisition of the discriminated taste aversion, as measured by the differential effects on saccharin drinking between drug and saline trials, required only two to three pairings of either drug stimulus with LiCl injections. The 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin discriminative stimulus cue generalized to other drugs that are selective for the 5-HT1A receptor, such as ipsapirone (8-16 mg/kg i.p.) or buspirone (4 mg/kg i.p.), but not to agonists that are selective for the 5-HT1B/1C receptor, such as 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine or 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine.

  ".W": "A number of vasoconstrictor agonists activate the Na+/H+ antiport system in vascular smooth muscle, leading to alkalinization of the cytosol and influx of Na+. It is believed that agonist-induced Na+/H+ exchange may play an important role in contraction. We have evaluated this hypothesis by determining the effect of inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange on phenylephrine (PE)-induced contraction of rat aorta. Preincubation of rat aorta with the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor amiloride (0.5 mM) inhibited subsequent PE-induced contraction. However, the more potent and specific Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor hexamethylene amiloride (10 microM) did not inhibit PE-induced contraction. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by removal of extracellular Na+ and substitution with N-methyl-D-glucamine only moderately reduced PE-induced contraction. Hexamethylene amiloride (10 microM) and methyl-isobutyl amiloride (30 microM), another potent and specific inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, caused a slow, sustained and reversible contraction of rat aorta which was 114.7 and 86.6%, respectively, of maximal PE-induced contraction. Hexamethylene amiloride-induced contraction was dose-dependent, dependent on extracellular calcium and inhibited by nifedipine. We conclude that the vasorelaxant effects of amiloride are unrelated to inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange, and may be mediated by inhibition of kinases involved in contraction. These results demonstrate that inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange has no major effect on agonist-induced contraction of rat aorta, and suggest that vasoconstrictor activation of Na+/H+ exchange does not play a major role in agonist-induced contraction of rat aorta.\r"

(-)-Norepinephrine (0.1-100 mumol/l) elicited a positive inotropic effect that was not antagonized by carbachol, failed to produce a positive inotropic staircase after resumption of stimulation and shortened relaxation time in a concentration-dependent fashion.(+/-)-Isoproterenol had a dual action: at low and moderately effective concentrations (1-30 nmol/l), the positive inotropic effect was antagonized by carbachol, a positive inotropic staircase was elicited and time to peak force was shortened. At (+/-)-isoproterenol concentrations exceeding an EC80 for the positive inotropic effect (greater than 30 nmol/l), relaxation time became shorter, staircase and carbachol-induced antagonism became less pronounced until at 300 nmol/l inotropic effects of (+/-)-isoproterenol resembled closely those of (-)-norepinephrine. Cyclic AMP derivatives and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine mimicked (+/-)-isoproterenol in their inotropic actions. Impairment of neuronal uptake caused (-)-norepinephrine 1) to produce (+/-)-isoproterenol-like effects on the isometric contraction, 2) to induce a positive inotropic staircase and 3) to become sensitive to carbachol-induced antagonism. The results are compatible with the concept that neuronal uptake produces a distribution of (-)-norepinephrine within the papillary muscle which allows predominantly high concentrations of (-)-norepinephrine to become effective in the receptor compartment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whether the effect of alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation in relation to sodium and water excretion in vivo is mediated through independent mechanisms is unclear. The dose-response relationship between renal alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation (clonidine) and water and electrolyte excretion was evaluated in anesthetized rats. Rats were nephrectomized unilaterally 7 to 10 days before the experimental day to allow isolation of renal function. A base-line level of sodium and water excretion was established by the infusion of saline (0.097 ml/min i.v.). In separate groups of rats, clonidine was infused directly into the renal artery at 0 (vehicle), 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 micrograms/kg/min at 0.0034 ml/min. The lower doses (0.1, 0.3 and 1 microgram/kg/min) produced a dose-related increase in urine volume and free water clearance and a decrease in urine osmolality. Electrolyte or solute excretion was not altered at these infusion rates even though urine volume increased 4-fold. The highest dose investigated (3 micrograms/kg/min) increased urine volume (9-fold) and sodium excretion (4-fold). Free water clearance and osmolar clearance were also increased. The effects of clonidine were attenuated by yohimbine but not prazosin indicating these effects were mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation. These results demonstrate a dose-related selectivity of alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation for water and sodium excretion. The increase in water excretion at the lower infusion rates would be consistent with the antagonism of the renal effects of vasopressin. The potent natriuresis observed only at higher doses indicates another mechanism may be involved.\r"

The concentration-response curve of the alpha-1-agonist in lesioned rats was shifted markedly to the left with the peak increase occurring at a concentration 200 times lower (500 nM) than that required to raise cAMP to the same extent in slices of the sham-operated controls. Adenylate cyclase activity measured on crude homogenate preparations was increased by the lesion, too. The alpha-1 antagonist WB-4101 (dimethyloxyphenoxy-ethylamino-methyl benzo-1,4-dioxan) was the most potent inhibitor of PHE in lesioned rats with an IC50 of 125 nM, 110 times lower than that of prazosin (14 microM); yohimbine and propranolol, respectively, alpha-2 and beta-antagonists caused inhibition only at very high concentrations. Serotonin (10 microM) induced a marked rightward shift in the concentration response of PHE in lesioned rats, without any effect of its own on the cAMP level. PHE stimulated inositol phosphates accumulation in hippocampal slices in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 20 microM. Chemical lesion of the serotonergic median raphe nuclei caused a significant reduction of PHEs maximal effect on inositol phosphate accumulation by 50% with no change detectable in the EC50. The results imply that both second messenger responses to PHE stimulation are modulated by serotonin. Whether cAMP and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate generated second messengers act in a cooperative manner, or independently, is discussed.\r"

The renal interaction between these drugs was investigated by a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods. The uptake of digoxin by brush border membrane vesicles was not affected by quinidine. Similarly, digoxin did not inhibit the uptake of the cation N-methylnicotinamide by these vesicles and did not alter the binding kinetics of digoxin to the Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase by the antiluminal membrane vesicles. By using the in vivo multiple indicator dilution technique transtubular transport of digoxin was documented; renal-artery infusion of quinidine did not affect the recovery of digoxin in the renal vein or urine. Clearance studies documented that the decrease in the renal clearance of digoxin is paralleled by a significant fall in renal blood flow evidenced by a decrease in p-aminohippuric acid clearance. It is concluded that quinidine inhibits the renal excretion of digoxin not by competition at the tubular cell membrane level, but rather by decreasing renal blood flow. A parallel decrease in biliary clearance of digoxin is documented and may suggest a similar mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The classical approach of displacing the dose-response curve by an alpha adrenoceptor blocker has most often failed to demonstrate a contribution of an alpha adrenoceptor-mediated component in the final inotropic response to norepinephrine unless the beta adrenoceptors are extensively blocked. To unmask and quantify the inotropic components in the response to norepinephrine, we took a different approach by studying reversal responses to appropriate adrenoceptor blockers in isolated paced rat papillary muscles maximally stimulated by norepinephrine. The inotropic response to norepinephrine was rapidly reversed by simultaneous addition of the beta adrenoceptor blocker timolol and the alpha adrenoceptor blocker prazosin. When the adrenoceptor blockers were added sequentially, both alpha and beta adrenoceptor-mediated components in the inotropic response to norepinephrine could be demonstrated: one beta adrenoceptor-mediated component (timolol sensitive only) that represented about 75% of the inotropic response and one alpha adrenoceptor-mediated component (prazosin sensitive only) that represented about 25% of the inotropic response. When one adrenoceptor population was eliminated by giving one of the adrenoceptor blockers before norepinephrine, the inotropic response in this situation could be completely reversed by the other adrenoceptor blocker. The expression of both alpha and beta adrenoceptor-mediated components was significantly less during concomitant receptor stimulation than when the respective receptor populations were stimulated separately. Thus, there was apparently a mutual inhibition of one component upon the other. Although the beta adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic component clearly was the dominating one, the present observations will explain the difficulties in demonstrating an alpha adrenoceptor-mediated component during unopposed beta adrenoceptor stimulation in the inotropic response to norepinephrine in earlier studies.\r"

Endothelial permeability of fluorescein-conjugated dextrans with increasing molecular size was correlated to monolayer pore shape, size and abundance by means of a mathematical model. Results showed that the in vitro pores had a longitudinal appearance with an effective pore size of 81 A and fractional pore area of 0.04%. These data indicate that the properties of the in vitro pores and in vivo tight junctions are comparable. The monolayer model was applied successfully to establish a relationship between endothelial permeability and drug lipophilicity, using several beta blocking agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as model drugs. Results showed a sigmoidal relationship between these parameters, indicating the existence of a threshold lipophilicity for passive transendothelial transport.\r"

Twenty-four hours after MCA-O, WIN-treated rats had significantly greater recovery of EEG activity and higher neurological scores than the controls; these actions were greatest at a dose of 40 micrograms/kg (P less than .01). The neurological outcome correlated with recovery of the ipsilateral EEG (P less than .01). The mortality rate 24 hr after occlusion and the infarct size were not significantly different from controls. At 1 hr after MCA-O, there were no significant differences in regional concentrations of endogenous opioid peptides (dynorphin, Leu-enkephalin and beta-endorphin) between the injured and uninjured hemispheres. These are the first studies to evaluate the effects of an opiate antagonist over a wide dose range in cerebral ischemia. Dose-related beneficial actions were found with regard to several, but not all, outcome measures. The absence of regional opioid changes after regional ischemia, in contrast to previous studies of spinal cord ischemia and brain trauma, was unexpected, but may reflect limited regional and temporal sampling.\r"

Both the direct acting adrenergic agonist, clonidine, and the \"indirect\" acting agonists, cocaine, desipramine and amphetamine elicited mydriatic responses. The polar alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, 4-hydroxyclonidine, did not elicit a mydriatic response when administered systemically; however, it did produce a pronounced mydriatic response when administered i.c.v. Inasmuch as the selective lipophilic alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not the polar alpha adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, reversed the mydriatic effects of clonidine and cocaine, these data suggest that centrally located alpha-2 adrenoceptors elicit the above mydriatic response. The direct acting alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists, clonidine (i.v.) and 4-hydroxyclonidine (i.c.v.), were the most efficacious of the agents studied in eliciting the mydriatic response. The indirect acting agents, amphetamine, desipramine and cocaine, were less efficacious. The rank order potency (ED-50) of these drugs was as follows: clonidine greater than desipramine greater than cocaine = amphetamine. The mydriatic effects of cocaine were attenuated by yohimbine and reserpine pretreatments. In addition, the local anesthetic, procaine, and the polar cocaine analog, cocaine methiodide, were significantly less efficacious than cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine elicits mydriasis by indirectly acting at central and postsynaptically located alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

Among the sites implicated in the membrane action of barbiturates are the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor, receptors for excitatory amino acids and Ca and potassium channels. The expression in Xenopus oocytes of various ligand- and voltage-gated channels offers the opportunity for more-detailed studies of such neuroactive substances as the barbiturates. Using RNA from human temporal cortex, we obtained the expression of an omega-conotoxin-sensitive, dihydropyridine-resistant Ca channel in Xenopus oocytes. Under voltage clamp, barbiturates depressed both the peak current and the steady-state current through this Ca channel. Barbiturates had no effect on the shape of the current-voltage relation, nor did they cause a shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. However, both the rate of inactivation of open Ca channels, as well as the proportion of channels inactivated at steady state were increased by barbiturates. The IC50 for these effects was about 0.25 mM for the more potent barbiturates tested. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sedative and anesthetic effects of barbiturates can be mediated in part by an action to depress Ca currents.\r"

  ".W": "Guinea pigs were treated chronically with morphine by implantation of pellets and the ileum was later removed for experiments in vitro. Intracellular recording from myenteric neurons showed that chronic morphine treatment led to the development of an increased calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization, whether this followed an action potential or the depolarization resulting from activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The properties of the neurons were otherwise normal. Naloxone depolarized about one-third of neurons and led to the appearance of spontaneous fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials in many cells. Extracellular recordings from neurons induced to fire with suction electrodes showed that the excitation caused by naloxone was prevented in solutions that contained sufficient cobalt to block synaptic transmission. Measurements of longitudinal muscle tension of intact pieces of ileum showed that the contracture caused by naloxone was much reduced by prior exposure of the ileum in vitro for 30 min to beta-funaltrexamine. The beta-funaltrexamine appeared to have irreversibly blocked a significant fraction of the mu receptors because the effectiveness of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol to inhibit nerve-evoked contractile responses (twitches) was much reduced in tissues treated with beta-funaltrexamine. These results indicate that at least a portion of the contracture results from an action of naloxone at kappa rather than mu receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In perfused segments of rabbit ear artery the effects of opioid agonists on vasoconstrictor responses to adrenergic nerve stimulation and stimulation-evoked [3H]norepinephrine overflow were compared using trains of 8, 40 or 120 monophasic pulses at 8 Hz with 1 msec duration and 40 V amplitude. Both delta selective peptides, [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin, met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin, and preferential kappa ligands, dynorphin1-13 and ethylketocyclazocine, significantly reduced the vasoconstriction evoked by 8 pulses at 8 Hz. The magnitude of this effect was inversely related to the stimulus train length. In most cases, opioid agonists were highly effective with short stimulus trains, but failed to decrease vasoconstrictor responses by more than 10 to 15% with trains of 120 pulses at 8 Hz. In good correlation with these data, in tissue preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine the inhibitory effect of opioids on the tritium overflow evoked by 8 or 120 pulses at 8 Hz was inversely proportional to the length of stimulation. Our findings confirm that opioid agonists interact with a heterogeneous prejunctional receptor population to modulate the action potential-evoked release of norepinephrine in the isolated ear artery of the rabbit. This modulation is more pronounced at the beginning of a stimulus train when the negative feedback inhibition of norepinephrine release is still not fully operative. It is suggested that the physiological role of opioid peptides could be more significant during a short rather than a prolonged vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Because histamine and adenosine are coreleased from the ischemic heart, we investigated the effects of their interaction on human myocardium. Surgical specimens of human right atrium (i.e., pectinate muscles) responded to histamine with increases in spontaneous rate and contractile force. Adenosine, and the A1-selective adenosine agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), reduced the spontaneous rate and suppressed the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of histamine. CPA was more potent than adenosine in slowing the spontaneous rate and in suppressing histamine's positive chronotropic effect, suggesting that the responses to CPA and adenosine are A1-mediated. CPA was also more potent than adenosine in attenuating histamine's positive inotropic effect on human ventricular papillary muscle. The adenosine-induced suppression of histamine's effects on pectinate muscles was mimicked by carbachol, which like adenosine is known to attenuate H2-mediated histamine-induced adenylate cyclase activation. The H1-selective histamine antagonist pyrilamine potentiated histamine's chronotropic and inotropic responses, and inhibited the attenuation of these responses by adenosine or carbachol. In contrast, pyrilamine failed to modify the adenosine-induced attenuation of the cardiac stimulatory effects of dimaprit, an H2-selective histamine agonist. Our data suggest that adenosine-induced suppression of histamine's positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on human myocardium results both from an A1-mediated attenuation of H2-stimulatory effects and from the uncovering of H1 negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. Thus, the results of the histamine-adenosine interaction may exceed the \"retaliatory\" purpose of adenosine release and uncover H1-mediated myocardial depression.\r"

Naloxone (1 mg/kg) inhibited the hemodynamic actions of 0.5 mg/kg dl-NANM. At a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, l-NANM, but not d-NANM, significantly increased heart rate and mean arterial pressure. The effects of l-NANM were blocked by naloxone but not by naloxone-methylbromide, indicating that the opiate effects are mediated by receptors located in the central nervous system. At a higher dose (0.5 mg/kg), d-NANM consistently produced small increases in heart rate and blood pressure which were statistically significant. The hemodynamic actions of Leu-enkephalin were inhibited by pretreatment with dl-NANM and l-NANM but not d-NANM. These results indicate that NANM has opiate hemodynamic activity which resides with the levorotary isomer. Dextrorotary isomer activity is nonopiate or possibly nonspecific. Furthermore, there appears to be a inhibitory interaction between NANM-opiate and enkephalin hemodynamic actions. This suggests that NANM-opiate receptors may be involved in modulation of the hemodynamic response to circulating enkephalins.\r"

Carbachol or oxotremorine, but not nicotine, i.c.v., enhanced hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol markedly, as measured by blood ethanol concentration at loss or righting response, in short-sleep (SS) but not long-sleep (LS) mice. Likewise, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine, i.c.v., differentially enhanced hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol in these mouse lines. LS and SS mice were equally sensitive to the hypothermic effects of carbachol, neostigmine or oxotremorine i.c.v. The muscarinic antagonists, atropine or pirenzepine, i.c.v., were without effect on ethanol sensitivity, but these compounds antagonized muscarinic agonist-enhanced ethanol sensitivity in SS mice effectively. Pirenzepine, and M1 selective antagonist, produced a parallel shift in the oxotremorine dose-response curve, indicating that the enhanced hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol may be due to interaction of oxotremorine with M1 muscarinic receptors. This possibility was supported by the finding that atropine and pirenzepine which are known to have comparable affinities for M1 but not M2 receptors, had comparable potencies in antagonizing the action of oxotremorine or neostigmine. The results suggest that LS and SS mice differ genetically in neuronal processes activated by specific muscarinic agonists and are consistent with the hypotheses that ethanol acts in part via membrane receptor coupling to intracellular processes known to mobilize intracellular Ca++.\r"

ACTH1-24 also increased hippocampal sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake activity that had been depressed by the barbiturate. Naloxone-pretreatment also blocked the analeptic and cholinergic activating properties of ACTH1-24. These results suggest that intraseptal ACTH1-24 produces its analeptic effect by activating a hippocampal cholinergic arousal system.\r"

In contrast, the glycine amide of indomethacin was less potent than indomethacin. The superiority of TGA relative to tolmetin sodium in alleviating this condition was demonstrated by inhibition of paw swelling and reduction of the degenerative bone changes that are associated with the progression of this chronic animal model of rheumatoid arthritis in humans. These properties were not evident when equimolar mixtures of tolmetin sodium and glycine were administered concurrently. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that TGA was absorbed completely and hydrolyzed to tolmetin in the female adjuvant arthritic rat. The combined effects of absorption, distribution and hydrolysis of TGA produced lower peak plasma tolmetin levels than an equivalent dose of tolmetin sodium, but plasma concentrations were sustained for a longer period of time contributing to an apparent increase in potency. Furthermore, TGA displayed a decreased propensity to cause gastrointestinal irritation compared to tolmetin sodium. Several additional amino acid amides of tolmetin were similar to the glycine amide in exhibiting increased potency and reduced gastrointestinal toxicity in comparison to equivalent doses of tolmetin sodium.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to characterize SK&F 104146 and SK&F 105494 for water diuretic activity (aquaretic activity) in hydropenic dogs and for antagonism of vasopressin-stimulated antidiuresis in hydrated dogs. The vasopressin receptor affinity and inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in renal membranes were also studied. When administered to hydropenic dogs, SK&F 101926 (3 or 30 micrograms/kg) did not cause a water diuresis. Substitution of the dipeptide tail of SK&F 101926 with Arg7D-Arg8NH2 (SK&F 104146; 30 micrograms/kg) was associated with a reduction of urine osmolality from 1876 +/- 182 to 349 +/- 94 mOsm/kg of H2O, and an increase in free water clearance (from -0.32 +/- 0.09 to 0.06 +/- 0.09 ml/min). Replacement of the 1 to 6 disulfide bridge of SK&F 104146 with a 1 to 6 dicarba bridge (SK&F 105494; 3 micrograms/kg) was associated with a further reduction of urine osmolality (1709 +/- 281 to 210 +/- 79 mOsm/kg of H2O) and a net positive free water clearance (from -0.56 +/- 0.02 to 0.6 +/- 0.35 ml/min). In water diuretic dogs, SK&F 104146 and 105494 shifted the vasopressin dose-response for antidiuresis to the right.

Pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished the negative inotropic responses, but was without effect on the positive inotropic responses in the guinea pig. Pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin abolished the negative inotropic response and enhanced the positive inotropic response. The positive inotropic response was attenuated by pretreatment with dietary lithium for 2 weeks, whereas no effect was observed on the negative inotropic response. Negative and positive inotropic responses to muscarinic agonists in these species are mediated directly through an M2 muscarinic receptor.

DOB and DOI displayed decreased affinity for 5-HT2 sites in the presence of 10(-4) M GTP, whereas the ability of d-LSD to compete for these sites was not affected by the presence of 10(-4) M GTP. Moreover, the Hill slope of the d-LSD competition curve was unity in both the absence and presence of 10(-4) M GTP. These findings suggest that d-LSD is an antagonist at 5-HT2 receptors. PI turnover studies in rat cortex showed that at 10(-5) M concentrations d-LSD, DOB and DOI display partial agonist activity in comparison to 10(-5) 5-HT. Stimulation of PI turnover by 5-HT, DOB and DOI was inhibited by the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (10(-6) M). The d-LSD PI signal was not affected by the presence of ketanserin. In addition, nanomolar concentrations of d-LSD did not stimulate PI turnover in rat cortex. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of d-LSD are able to significantly antagonize the stimulatory effect of 10(-5) M 5-HT on PI turnover. These data suggest that d-LSD acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2 receptors in rat cortex. At high concentrations (greater than 1 microM) d-LSD stimulates low-level PI turnover via a non-5-HT2 receptor-mediated mechanism.\r"

Responses to McN-A-343 were unchanged after 4-DAMP, and responses to bethanachol were unchanged after pirenzepine. Topical McN-A-343 and bethanachol elicited modest increases in cortical periarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha. Topical acetylcholine (10(-7), 10(-4) M) elicited pial arteriolar constriction and large increases in cerebrospinal fluid prostanoid levels which were blocked by atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and topical pirenzepine (10(-3) M), but not by topical 4-DAMP. These data demonstrate the existence of M-1 and M-2 receptors in the cerebral circulation of the newborn pig and indicate that acetylcholine elicits cerebrovascular constriction and increased cerebrospinal fluid prostanoid synthesis via activation of M-1 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Pirenzepine selectively antagonized muscarinic receptor-mediated cyclic GMP formation in a noncompetitive fashion in mouse neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115). These effects of pirenzepine were time- and concentration-dependent and they were also reversible. Interestingly, whereas atropine elicited competitive antagonism of the cyclic GMP response at low concentrations, it also behaved like a noncompetitive antagonist at higher concentrations and its effects were partially reversible. Using additional approaches to study the mechanisms underlying this anomalous antagonistic profile of pirenzepine, we investigated whether this deviation from competition could be due to the short time of exposure to muscarinic agonists (30 sec) used in cyclic GMP measurements. Our data indicated that the mode of pirenzepine-induced antagonism of ligand binding to muscarinic receptors was different when assessed using nonequilibrium (30 sec) or equilibrium (1 hr) incubations. Thus, pirenzepine appeared to be noncompetitive and competitive under these two conditions, respectively. Furthermore, although pirenzepine blocked receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis competitively when the response was measured at 20 min, it was clearly noncompetitive using 5-min incubations. Therefore, the noncompetitive antagonism by pirenzepine detected in cyclic GMP measurements might be only apparent and might be attributed, at least in part, to a lack of an equilibrium state under the specific conditions of these assays.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated a cooperative interaction between peptido-leukotrienes (LTs) and epinephrine (EPI) relative to induction of platelet aggregation and thromboxane formation. To examine if a similar interaction occurs in arteries, we studied the effects of LTD4 and EPI as well as norepinephrine (NOREPI) on isolated rat aortic rings. LTD4 alone (mean concentration 2 x 10(-7) M) induced contraction in 10 of 15 rings examined (mean peak tension 0.31 +/- 0.27 g/mg of tissue). However, pretreatment of aortic rings with LTD4 (10(-7) M) consistently and significantly enhanced the contractile effects of EPI and NOREPI and lowered the threshold concentration of these agonists required to evoke contraction from 4 x 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-10) M (P less than .05). This enhancement of the sensitivity of aortic rings by LTD4 was not observed when KCl or 5-hydroxytryptamine was used as agonists. Furthermore, the LTD4-induced potentiation of effects of EPI or NOREPI on aortic contraction was blocked by the LT-receptor antagonist FPL-55712, but not by indomethacin. These data suggest a specific cooperative contractile effect of LTD4 and alpha adrenergic agonists on rat aortic rings. This LTD4 potentiation of vascular contraction is mediated through LT-receptor stimulation and not through release of cyclooxygenase metabolites.\r"

[3H]Atenolol efflux from preloaded PC12 cells was increased 4-fold in response to membrane depolarization by elevated extracellular potassium (50 mM). [3H]Norepinephrine release was enhanced 4.5-fold under the same conditions. Potassium-induced release of both [3H] atenolol and [3H]norepinephrine was inhibited completely in the absence of extracellular calcium. [3H]Atenolol release from PC12 cells was also reduced by the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine (IC50 = 1.6 +/- 0.5 nM). In addition, the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 (1 microM) significantly enhanced potassium-induced [3H]atenolol efflux. After loading overnight, accumulation and storage of the (-)-enantiomer of atenolol by PC12 cells was found to be approximately 3-fold greater than that of the (+)-enantiomer. The (-)-enantiomer of atenolol was also preferentially released by 50 mM potassium with a (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio of 3.6 to 1. The results support the existence within neurosecretory cells of storage and calcium-dependent release mechanisms which result in stereoselective secretion of the (-)-or active enantiomer of atenolol in response to membrane depolarization.\r"

  ".W": "A series of arylpiperazines was examined for structure-function relationships at the human platelet serotonin (5-HT) receptor. Amplification of ADP-induced aggregation was used to measure 5-HT receptor activation. The platelet serotonergic agonists 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT) and the antagonist ketanserin were used for comparison of potency and amplitude of response. All arylpiperazines, including the parent compound phenylpiperazine (PP) showed antagonist activity. The monosubstituted phenylpiperazines acted only as antagonists, and electron-withdrawing substituents markedly enhanced activity. Modification of PP by addition of another phenyl ring or benz-fusion also enhanced antagonist activity. Benz-fusion at the b face of PP (1-NP) yielded greater antagonist potency than benz-fusion at the c face (2-NP). The latter modification, however, also conferred a variable agonist activity with a very weak response. In contrast, the heteroaromatic piperazines consistently demonstrated concentration dependent mixed antagonist-agonist activity. These compounds were weak agonists compared with 5-HT, 5-MeOT and DOI, although the amplitude of the quipazine response was similar to DOI. This study demonstrates that the arylpiperazines, which are variably selective for the multiple brain 5-HT receptors, are all antagonists on the platelet 5-HT receptor. The antagonist activity is markedly increased by ring monosubstitution or aryl modification. Compared with the monosubstituted analogues, antagonist activity is decreased by heteroaromatic modification or by the addition of an N-aminophenethyl group to the 4-position nitrogen. Weak agonist activity can be conferred by heteroaromatic modification.\r"

We observed recently that salicylate (SA), in contrast to meclofenamate (MECLO) or aspirin, caused a diuresis and natriuresis in the sodium-depleted dog. To determine if SA would similarly affect the kidneys in a cirrhotic subject, the effects of SA (40 mg/kg) and subsequent MECLO treatment (2 mg/kg) were evaluated in five normal and six common bile-duct-ligated (CBDL) miniature swine. All six CBDL animals showed signs of biliary cirrhosis and four of the six were ascitic at the time of study. SA did not significantly alter renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate in either the normal or CBDL animals. In both groups, SA caused a significant diuresis and natriuresis. MECLO, given after SA, caused a reduction in renal blood flow in the normal but not in the CBDL animals, but did not alter glomerular filtration rate in either group. In the CBDL animals, when MECLO was given alone a significant decrease in renal blood flow occurred. MECLO abolished the SA-induced diuresis and natriuresis in the normal swine but only affected the SA-mediated natriuresis in the CBDL animals. SA significantly reduced renal prostaglandin E2 excretion in both groups. With MECLO, prostaglandin E2 excretion was reduced further in the normals but not in the CBDL animals. These data demonstrate that SA does not produce detectable renal vasoconstriction in the cirrhotic pig.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of gentamicin on agonist stimulation of the PI cascade in primary culture of rabbit proximal tubular cells (RPTC) and in rat renal cortex. Parathyroid (PTH) (10(-6) M) stimulated a significant increase in total inositol phosphates, inositol monophosphate and inositol trisphosphate, but not inositol bisphosphate in RPTC with the peak effect at 2 min. This effect was completely inhibited in RPTC exposed to 10(-3) M gentamicin for 48 and 24 hr. In other experiments we demonstrated that angiotensin II, phenylephrine, bradykinin and arginine vasopressin (all at 10(-6) M) stimulated inositol trisphosphate generation in control RPTC but not in cells exposed to 10(-3) M gentamicin for 24 h. In contrast gentamicin did not block PTH-stimulation of cyclic AMP generation, which indicates that gentamicin did not prevent PTH from interacting with its plasma membrane receptor. PTH also stimulated redistribution of protein kinase C from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of RPTC. This effect was completely abolished in RPTC exposed to 10(-3) M gentamicin for 2 days. PTH given i.p. to rats stimulated the redistribution of protein kinase C from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of renal cortex. This effect was completely inhibited in rats injected with gentamicin, 100 mg/kg per day for 2 days. The\r"

The addition of a tissue stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol, to the incubation medium enabled us to demonstrate extracellular enzymic activity within the articular cartilage matrix of arthritic joints. Both intravenous and oral treatment of the animals with a selective inhibitor of cathepsin B, Z-Phe-Ala fluoromethyl ketone (CH2F), during the development of arthritis suppressed the degree of inflammation and resulted in decreased intracellular and extracellular cathepsin B activity as detected histochemically, and less cartilage damage. Our study indicates that (a) cathepsin B-like activity plays a role in the cascade of proteolytic cartilage destruction, (b) chondrocytes and fibroblasts may well be involved in the breakdown of cartilage and ligaments, and (c) Z-Phe-AlaCH2F could be of therapeutic value.\r"

Her arthritis flared in April, 1986 at which time seroconversion to B. burgdorferi was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. She was treated with phenoxymethyl penicillin and has had no further flare of her arthritis. The possible relationship between her rheumatic disease and her seroconversion to B. burgdorferi is discussed.\r"

We performed biopsies of the iliac crest in 12 blacks (6 men and 6 women) and 13 whites (8 men and 5 women) who were matched for age (range, 19 to 46 years) and weight, to determine whether histomorphometric differences between blacks and whites could be identified. The static measurements of cortical and cancellous bone architecture were not significantly different in the two groups. In contrast, the dynamic measurements, determined with tetracycline markers, showed that the mean rate of bone formation in the blacks was only 35 percent of that in the whites (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the rate of bone turnover is lower in blacks than in whites, since bone resorption and bone formation are closely coupled in the steady state. If reconstitution of previously resorbed cavities at remodeling sites is incomplete in osteoporosis, a reduction in the rate of skeletal remodeling could provide a means for maintaining and preserving bone mass in blacks.\r"

All subjects underwent detailed clinical evaluation, including standardized measures of mental status, strength, reflexes, balance, and gait; in addition, we inspected their homes for environmental hazards. Falls and their circumstances were identified during bimonthly telephone calls. During one year of follow-up, 108 subjects (32 percent) fell at least once; 24 percent of those who fell had serious injuries and 6 percent had fractures. Predisposing factors for falls were identified in linear-logistic models. The adjusted odds ratio for sedative use was 28.3; for cognitive impairment, 5.0; for disability of the lower extremities, 3.8; for palmomental reflex, 3.0; for abnormalities of balance and gait, 1.9; and for foot problems, 1.8; the lower bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals were 1 or more for all variables. The risk of falling increased linearly with the number of risk factors, from 8 percent with none to 78 percent with four or more risk factors (P less than 0.0001). About 10 percent of the falls occurred during acute illness, 5 percent during hazardous activity, and 44 percent in the presence of environmental hazards. We conclude that falls among older persons living in the community are common and that a simple clinical assessment can identify the elderly persons who are at the greatest risk of falling.\r"

Such dissociations are the defining characteristic of 'blindsight'; comparable phenomena are seen in some patients with amnesia and some with prosopagnosia, a profound impairment of familiar face recognition. We report here an analogous dissociation between overt and covert perception in a case of visuo-spatial neglect. The patient, P.S., had sustained right cerebral damage and failed overtly to process information in the hemispace contralateral to lesion. In common with most patients who manifest left-sided neglect, P.S. has a left homonymous hemianopia. Nonetheless, her neglect persists despite free movement of the head and eyes and is thus not a direct consequence of sensory loss in the left visual field. P.S. was presented simultaneously with two line drawings of a house, in one of which the left side was on fire. She judged that the drawings were identical; yet when asked to select which house she would prefer to live in, she reliably chose the house that was not burning.\r"

When children are separated from their biological mothers shortly after birth and placed nonselectively in adoptive homes, adoptive-parent/adopted-child resemblance can be ascribed to cultural transmission, whereas biological-parent/adopted-child similarities are due to heritable factors. Furthermore, a longitudinal adoption study facilitates examination of changes in these two main sources of variation during development. The Colorado Adoption Project is the first large-scale longitudinal adoption study of behavioural development and was initiated in 1975. Data were collected from biological parents of 245 adopted children, the adoptive parents and parents of 245 matched nonadopted children. The children have subsequently been tested at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years of age, and at the end of their first year in primary school (average age, 7.4 years). The number of subjects tested is now adequate for analysis of data over 7 years. The results provide conclusive evidence for increasing heritable variation of general mental ability, ranging from 9% at 1 year of age to 36% at 7 years.\r"

Song typically waxes and wanes with the seasonal cycle of testicular growth and regression and decreases after adult castration. Testosterone therapy reinstates song, induces it in females, augments it in intact males, and spring testosterone profiles correlate with seasonal song production. Thus, testosterone has been viewed as a major factor in song acquisition and production acting either directly, or after aromatization within the brain. We show here, however, that song learning and early phases of the development of singing both take place in castrated male birds with no significant levels of testosterone in their blood plasma. Testosterone seems to be required for song crystallization, however. Oestradiol was unexpectedly still present after castration, evidently from a non-testicular source, throughout the period of male song acquisition.\r"

  ".W": "In animal development, the first tissues to be formed include such major components as muscle, nerve cord, notochord and the eye. In the vertebrates, all of these tissues are formed by embryonic induction, a process by which some of the cells within a mass of tissue are caused to change their direction of differentiation as a result of close proximity to cells of another kind. The induced cells typically form a solid coherent mass with a distinct border between them and the remaining uninduced cells. This clean separation between induced and uninduced cells is much sharper than can readily be explained as a result of the induction process. We describe here the culture of amphibian cell and tissue recombinations in solid gels containing cytochalasin in which cell division and cell movement is inhibited during response to induction. This has revealed an effect in which the ability of a cell to respond to induction by differentiating as muscle is enhanced by, or even dependent on, other neighbouring cells differentiating in the same way at the same time. This seems to be a newly described process in animal development, termed the community effect. It helps to explain the formation of blocks of tissue from sheets of cells, and could be of widespread occurrence and significance in morphogenesis resulting from embryonic induction.\r"

  ".W": "In the developing nervous system, axons project considerable distances along stereotyped pathways to reach their targets. Axon guidance depends partly on the recognition of cell-surface and extracellular matrix cues derived from cells along the pathways. It has also been proposed that neuronal growth cones are guided by gradients of chemoattractant molecules emanating from their intermediate or final cellular targets. Although there is evidence that the axons of some peripheral neurons in vertebrates are guided by chemotropism and the directed growth of some central axons to their targets is consistent with such a mechanism, it remains to be determined whether chemotropism operates in the central nervous system. During development of the spinal cord, commissural axons are deflected towards a specialized set of midline neural epithelial cells, termed the floor plate, which could reflect guidance by substrate cues or by diffusible chemoattractant molecules. Here we provide evidence in support of chemotropic guidance by demonstrating that the rat floor-plate cells secrete a diffusible factor(s) that influences the pattern and orientation of commissural axon growth in vitro without affecting other embryonic spinal cord axons. These findings support the hypothesis that chemotropic mechanisms guide developing axons to their intermediate targets in the vertebrate CNS.\r"

The D2 dopamine receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of movement disorders, schizophrenia and drug addiction. The D2 dopamine receptor interacts with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins to induce second messenger systems. Other members of the family of receptors that are coupled to G proteins share a significant similarity in primary amino-acid sequence and exhibit an archetypical topology predicted to consist of seven putative transmembrane domains. We have taken advantage of the expected nucleotide sequence similarities among members of this gene family to isolate genes coding for new receptors. Using the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene as a hybridization probe we have isolated related genes including a cDNA encoding the rat D2 dopamine receptor. This receptor has been characterized on the basis of three criteria: the deduced amino-acid sequence which reveals that it is a member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors; the tissue distribution of the mRNA which parallels that of the D2 dopamine receptor; and the pharmacological profile of mouse fibroblast cells transfected with the cDNA.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer radiotherapy uses high doses of ionizing radiation (1-10(2) Gy; 10(2)-10(4) rad) because only a small fraction of the absorbed dose leads to lethal double-strand breaks in DNA. These breaks are more efficiently produced by Auger electrons (1-10 eV nm-1) generated in proximity to the DNA. The energy of these electrons (on average 21 electrons for the decay of 125I) is dissipated within 10-100 nm of the Auger event and produces multiple double-strand DNA breaks. A single Auger event can be lethal to a cell and is comparable to more than 10(5) photon absorption events in conventional radiotherapy. We now report that 57Fe(III).bleomycin, administered to malignant cells in vitro and in vivo and irradiated with resonant Mossbauer gamma rays (14.4 keV), causes ablation of the malignant cells, presumably by Auger cascade, with extremely small radiation doses--about 10(-5) Gy. As a basis for comparison, about 5 Gy is necessary to achieve a similar effect with conventional radiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United Kingdom and the second most common in women, accounting for between 25 and 40% of all cancer deaths. Cigarette smoking is widely accepted as the major cause of lung cancer and linear relationships have been established between the number of cigarettes smoked and lung cancer risk. Although approximately 50 carcinogenic chemicals have been identified in cigarette smoke, a causal link between specific compounds and lung cancer has yet to be made. Studies on cigarette smokers' urine, blood and placenta have provided indications of carcinogen exposure, and although the presence of covalently-bound adducts in human DNA provides evidence of exposure to carcinogens, there have been no reports of systematic studies on the levels of DNA adducts in human lung. We report here, using the 32P-post-labelling technique, that cigarette smokers have higher adduct levels than non-smokers, that there is a linear relationship between adduct levels and daily or lifetime cigarette consumption, and that people who have given up smoking for at least five years have adduct levels similar to those of non-smokers.\r"

In the coronal plane 62% showed superior disk position, 33% showed medial disk position, and 4% showed lateral disk position. There were no statistically significant associations between disk positions in the sagittal and coronal planes. The vertical distance from the central part of the condyle to the fossa was measured in the coronal sections and was smaller in joints with medial disk position than in joints with superior disk position. It was concluded that medial disk position is relatively frequent in elderly persons and that this condition might represent a variant of temporomandibular joint internal derangement.\r"

Successful prosthodontic restoration was accomplished through the use of a two-piece Gunning splint both for intermaxillary fixation and as a guidance appliance in an edentulous patient who underwent a hemisection of the mandible subsequent to treatment for an ameloblastoma. Because mandibular guidance therapy is most successful in patients whose resection involves only bony structures with minimal loss of soft tissue and no radical neck dissection or radiation therapy, the patient treated for ameloblastoma is an ideal candidate for the use of a two-piece Gunning splint for intermaxillary fixation and mandibular guidance therapy.\r"

Biopsy and surgical specimens were examined for degree of differentiation, pattern and depth of stromal invasion, lymphatic-vascular invasion, and lymphoplasmacytic response in relation to metastasis. The incidence of lymph node metastasis in tumors showing grade III type diffuse invasion (71.4%) and with stromal invasion of more than 8 mm in depth (83.3%) was significantly higher than that of tumors with well-demarcated boundaries (44.4% to 5.2%) and superficial invasion (35.3% to 8.3%). Lymph node metastasis also increased in the presence of lymphatic-vascular invasion by tumor cells, whereas the degree of differentiation and lymphoplasmacytic response was not related to metastasis. Thus, the pattern and the depth of stromal invasion and the presence of lymphatic-vascular invasion were important indicators in prediction of cervical lymph node metastasis. Prophylactic neck dissection is advocated when grade III type diffuse invasion, invasion exceeding 8 mm in depth, or grade II type invasion accompanied by a 4 mm to 8 mm depth of invasion is observed in a biopsy specimen.\r"

No labeling was obtained with antibodies to cytokeratin, desmin, neurofilaments, and glial filaments; this suggests that this tumor is not derived from epithelium, muscle, neural, or astrocytic origins, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining of the tissue with antibodies to fibronectin and to collagen indicated that the tumor contained low levels of these extracellular matrix proteins. The results suggest the possible use of antibodies to intermediate filaments as histogenetic markers for the clarification of the origin of tumors whose nature cannot be unequivocally determined by conventional histopathologic methods.\r"

Radiation reductions between 62% and 92% were achieved with the screen/film systems when compared to the two conventional dental films.

  ".W": "The progression of renal failure was analyzed in 108 patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, none of whom had received any form of dietary protein, phosphate restriction or immunosuppressive treatment. The reciprocal of plasma creatinine was plotted against time using a minimum of six plasma creatinine values taken over at least six months (mean 13 values over 41 months). Plots indicated there was linear deterioration in 70 patients, non-linear deterioration in 15 and stable renal function in 24. Progressive renal failure was common in patients with glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, chronic pyelonephritis and polycystic kidney disease. Most patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, analgesic nephropathy and renal impairment following acute renal failure were stable. Among those with progressive impairment the mean rates of deterioration were significantly faster for patients with glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy compared to those with chronic pyelonephritis, polycystic kidney disease and undiagnosed renal disease (p less than 0.01). Hence the underlying renal pathological changes appear to be important in determining progression of renal failure and also the subsequent rate of deterioration. For those with linear progression of renal failure there was a significant correlation between 24-h urinary protein excretion and the rate of deterioration. This relationship held for glomerulonephritis and chronic pyelonephritis as separate diagnostic groups only. Proteinuria, therefore, may be a useful prognostic index for the rate of progression of established renal failure. Calcium phosphate product correlated poorly with the rate of deterioration. We were unable to demonstrate a relationship between spontaneous protein intake and deterioration of renal function. However, patients prescribed high protein diets were not included in dietary analysis and we cannot, therefore, exclude the possibility that a high dietary protein intake may accelerate renal failure. Similarly we were unable to show a significant relationship between blood pressure and progression of renal failure although there were weak correlations between mean arterial pressure and rate of deterioration for chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis.\r"

The in vivo function of macrophage C3 receptors was also found to be abnormal: AIDS patients had a relatively large release of cell back into the circulation, suggesting failure of macrophage phagocytosis. The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of circulating mononuclear cells was significantly lower in AIDS patients than in healthy controls. Monocyte nonspecific phagocytosis and surface marker expression were intact. Defective monocyte and macrophage function is an integral part of the immunopathology of AIDS, leading to the failure to control opportunistic pathogens. Whether these defects are due to intrinsic infection of the mononuclear phagocytes with HIV or are secondary to other events in the network of HIV infection remains to be determined.\r"

Enzootic skunk rabies occurs mainly in four geographic regions: (1) southern Ontario and Quebec and upper New York State; (2) the north central United States and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; (3) California; and (4) south central United States (Texas and several adjacent states). Rabies in these areas (in skunks and, to a large extent, in other terrestrial mammals) is caused mainly by three street virus variants, as determined by monoclonal antibody testing (one variant for areas 2 and 3 and separate variants for each of areas 1 and 4). Experimental studies suggest that the species specificity (e.g., raccoon vs. skunk) of enzootic rabies is due, at least partly, to differences in the pathogenicity of variants of rabies virus.\r"

The virus strain involved in the epizootic proved to be identical to rabies strains found in infected dogs in many African countries. Such a sudden and large outbreak of rabies could not be explained on the basis of the etiologic agent. A thorough investigation into kudu characteristics revealed that the kudu population had increased disproportionally before the epizootic in response to favorable conditions. The social behavior of the kudu, i.e., group browsing on acacia trees, whose thorns cause lesions in the kudu's oral cavity, as well as the excretion of relatively high titers of virus in the saliva of infected animals provide suitable conditions for transmission in the kudu population after initial infection through the jackal or other species. These factors offer an explanation for this epizootic.\r"

Foxes were chosen for research purposes because they are a problem species and are exquisitely susceptible to rabies.

The first field trial of a cloned SAD (Street Alabama Dufferin) strain in baits designed to immunize foxes orally was conducted in an Alpine valley in Switzerland in 1978. A population containing approximately 60% immune foxes at the valley entrance stopped the spread of the disease into untreated upper parts of the valley. The strategic use of oral vaccination of foxes in additional regions of Switzerland resulted in freedom from the zoonosis in four-fifths of the country.\r"

To meet this goal it was necessary to develop methods for the large-scale production of the SAD (Street Alabama Dufferin) clone B19 vaccine as well as to develop a bait that could be mass-produced (the Tubingen fox bait). It has been shown that after a single vaccination campaign in the field approximately 75% of the fox population is immune to rabies and that after one or two repeated campaigns vaccination in many areas could be discontinued. Participation in the field trial in circumscribed border areas was extended to Italy in 1985 and to Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in 1986. For the first time, through the use of oral immunization, a method for the elimination of rabies is available that is effective, safe, inexpensive, and practical. Further, this method meets the requirements of animal-protection societies, does not interfere with the preservation of endangered species, and therefore represents a significant political factor.\r"

The bait consists of a polyethylene bag that contains either a 30-g hamburger ball or a 25-mL cube of polyurethane sponge coated with a wax-beef tallow mixture containing 100-150 mg of tetracycline as a biomarker. Attractants used with the sponge were added to the bag (e.g., liver slurry, cheeses, fish oils, or fruits). Baits (greater than 80,000) were dropped from light aircraft at densities of 18-120 baits/km2 over test areas in Ontario and Pennsylvania. Rates of bait acceptance were assessed by the presence of fluorescent tetracycline deposits in the teeth of animals obtained from hunters and trappers. Bait acceptance reached 74% in foxes, 54% in skunks, 43% in raccoons, and 85% in coyotes in the Ontario trials; bait acceptance by raccoons in a small trial in Pennsylvania reached 76%. Also, 66% of juvenile foxes that ate baits ate a second bait 7 or more days after eating the first, thus giving the potential for a booster effect. The cost of aerial distribution of bait (excluding cost of bait and vaccine) in Canadian dollars was $1.45/km2. The aerial distribution system is capable of economically reaching a high proportion of foxes, skunks, and raccoons over large areas. Trials with attenuated ERA (Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth) vaccines are under way in Ontario.\r"

The ecology of the reservoir animals, the relations of dogs and cats to people, and the development of culturally adaptable approaches to rabies control have received little serious attention. As a part of a rabies control pilot program assisted by the World Health Organization, the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, was chosen as an urban center of high rabies prevalence in animals and high rabies risk in people. The ecology of dogs and cats was investigated, and the findings were applied in developing a model based on community education, annual house-to-house vaccination campaigns, stabilization of the dog and cat populations, limitation of restriction and removal of animals to focal-outbreak control, and environmental measures to promote population control. Initial implementation has been successful, and longitudinal studies are in place to monitor maintenance of control.\r"

In dogs showing signs, rabies was not invariably fatal. Up to 20% of dogs recovered without any supportive treatment. Some dogs inoculated with American (southern Texas) or Ethiopian canine street virus excreted virus in their saliva up to 14 days before signs appeared. There was no relation between the time of excretion of virus in the saliva and the titer of virus in the salivary glands at death. One dog that recovered from rabies intermittently excreted rabies virus in its saliva for a long time. The carrier state in rabies may play a significant role in the perpetuation and survival of the virus and may become a source for rabies outbreaks whenever a new generation of rabies susceptibles reaches critical density.\r"

Particular focus is given to the organization of these campaigns, which took place on a single day in more than 1,000 towns in 20 states, including large metropolitan areas such as Rio de Janeiro. Three levels of public health services (federal, state, and municipal) were involved in the organization of these campaigns. The massive participation of the community is also emphasized. Nearly 100,000 people from different segments of the community, especially students and members of the armed forces and state military police, participated as vaccinators or in other roles on the national day of the dog rabies vaccination. Another fundamental point is the support given in the media by means of national and state broadcasts during the 2 weeks before the day of vaccination. The study shows a progressive decrease in the number of cases of rabies in dogs and in humans during the period, a decrease that can be reasonably attributed to the increase in the number of vaccinations for dog rabies. In 1980 there were reported 4,570 cases of rabies in dogs and 168 cases of rabies in humans; in 1985 the incidence was reduced to 496 and 52 cases, respectively.\r"

A serologic survey was also done to determine the immune response among randomly selected vaccinated dogs, with titers determined 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after vaccination. Twelve months after vaccination, 97% of the dogs had a rabies neutralizing antibody titer of greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/mL, and 87% had a titer of greater than or equal to 1.0 IU/mL.

An important reduction in the number of cases of rabies was observed in some countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama), mainly as a result of the use of effective vaccines that are now available and of the application of new technology to reduce the vampire bat population, the vector of the disease in cattle.

Rabies virus infection was studied through routine monoclonal antinucleocapsid antibody immunofluorescence and through a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunoperoxidase method. The latter was modified to detect the in situ production of growth hormone by uninfected and rabies virus-infected adeno-a-pituicytes (with confirmation of the results both in vivo and in vitro). Infection with rabies virus made the specialized pituicytes produce less growth hormone. Growth before rabies virus infection and its reduction due to infection were investigated in a linear regression model. The fit was statistically significant (P less than .05) in all species studied: mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, and cat. Immune depression was studied in terms of alterations in the immunotopography of the thymus and also the specific T- and B-cell homing areas of the spleen (although spleen data are not presented here). On the basis of these results and a thorough review of wasting syndromes encountered in other diseases, a primary failure to thrive and an ensuing wasting syndrome were described and characterized for rabies, and their origin was assigned to a dysfunction of the hypophyseal/hypothalamic/thymic axis associated with at least (but not necessarily only) one of the centrally controlled growth hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Rabies virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have served to describe operationally the topography of the antigenic structure of the glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins of rabies virus. With the use of nucleocapsid protein-specific MAbs and cleavage fragments of the nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein, it has been possible to identify the chemical structure of two antigenic sites of the nucleoprotein and one antigenic site of the phosphoprotein. Antisera produced to synthetic peptides that make up the structure of these antigenic sites exhibited reactivities similar to those of MAbs. Analysis of a large number of isolates of rabies virus from different animal species and from different geographic locations revealed that rabies viruses differ considerably in their antigenic structure and can be identified according to their characteristic reactivity patterns with MAbs. Analysis of field virus isolates has also revealed that strains of rabies virus generally are associated with only one or a few major mammalian hosts within any given geographic area. Protection experiments in mice have not demonstrated correlations between protective activity and degree of antigenic difference between the vaccine strain and the challenge virus. Therefore, changes in antigenic structure, as determined by analysis with rabies virus-specific MAbs, cannot predict whether a given rabies vaccine will protect against a particular field virus.\r"

  ".W": "Rabies is prevalent in most parts of the world. An extensive reservoir of the disease is present in the population of wild animals. The fox in particular is a major vector of the disease in North America and Europe. Although attempts to control rabies by vaccination of wild carnivores with attenuated rabies virus have met with some success, this approach remains controversial. The potential of a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rabies glycoprotein for the protection of foxes against rabies was examined. Both the parental (wild-type) and recombinant viruses were found to be innocuous to foxes. Inoculation of live recombinant virus via the subcutaneous, intradermal, or oral routes uniformly elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and animals that received 10(8) plaque-forming units of the recombinant virus in bait resisted severe challenge with live rabies virus.\r"

  ".W": "Raccoon rabies exists in epizootic proportions in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, but efficacious oral vaccines for control of rabies in this important vector have not been previously demonstrated. Alternatively, a vaccinia recombinant virus vaccine (V-RG) expressing the ERA (Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth) rabies virus glycoprotein was highly immunogenic for laboratory animals and raccoons by the intradermal, intramuscular, and oral routes. Raccoons that ate a synthetic sponge bait containing 1.0 mL (10(8) pfu/mL) of V-RG were completely (eight of eight) or 80% (eight of 10) protected from challenge with street rabies virus at 30 and 205 days after ingestion, respectively. In laboratory contact trials limited V-RG transmission occurred between animals that were rabies seronegative and those that were orally immunized and seropositive. After ingestion of bait, V-RG virus was recovered from buccal mucosa, tonsil, and parotid or submandibular lymph nodes of raccoons within 24-48 hours of oral immunization but not thereafter. Adult and immature raccoons showed no adverse clinical signs or gross or microscopic lesions attributable to V-RG vaccination at any time.\r"

Techniques used commonly in molecular biology research can and should be applied to questions about the behavior of the rabies virus and the responses of the challenged host so that new generations of vaccines may be produced. The vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine acts by inducing neutralizing antibody to rabies virus and completely protects various species of vaccinated animals against challenge with rabies virus. The vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine is the most promising of the new generation of rabies serums.\r"
