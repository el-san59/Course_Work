  ".W": "Regional differences in the response to cholera toxin were evaluated in rat jejunum, ileum, and colon in vivo. Ligated intestinal loops were exposed to a supramaximal concentration of cholera toxin for 5 hr, and net fluid transport, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities of mucosal homogenates were determined. The fluid transport response and the specific activities of adenylate cyclase (with and without cholera toxin) and phosphodiesterase declined progressively from the jejunum to the colon. In contrast, cAMP concentrations (with and without cholera toxin) were lowest in the jejunum and highest in the colon. These results demonstrate that cAMP concentrations of the total mucosal homogenate do not parallel cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion in the three intestinal segments. Rather, the activities of adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase suggest a relation between fluid secretion and the turnover of cAMP.\r"

Fourteen developed severe symptoms following a hysterectomy, while the remainder had symptoms arising de novo and unrelated to pelvic surgery. To establish whether there were specific abnormalities which might be linked to hysterectomy, we compared the two groups. Rectosigmoid motility was impaired in the de novo group. Functional sphincter length, maximum resting anal canal pressure, and the rectoanal inhibitory reflex were not significantly different from controls. The majority of patients were able to significantly increase the anorectal angle on straining to defecate. Patients in the de novo group had a higher sensory threshold for rectal filling compared with controls, whereas the posthysterectomy group was not significantly different. Electromyography of the external sphincter showed failure of appropriate inhibition of resting activity in 57% of the de novo and 38% of posthysterectomy patients. The de novo group had hypoactivity of the rectosigmoid and an insensitive rectum. The abnormality in the hysterectomy group is less clear and any precise link between slow transit constipation and hysterectomy remains obscure.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of the rectum by barium enema does not correlate well with rectometrographic studies and is not predictive of bowel function. The purpose of the present study was to describe clinical and functional data in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, where a megarectum was diagnosed by a rectometrogram. Among 355 patients who underwent rectal elasticity studies, 35 were found to have a megarectum (maximum tolerable volume above 320 ml in women and 440 in men) for which no specific etiology was recognized. They, and a group of 11 healthy controls who were not sensitive to stress, underwent studies of stool frequency, colonic transit time of radiopaque markers, rectal elasticity, and anorectal pressures and reflexes. The elasticity coefficient of the rectal wall was decreased in patients as compared to controls (P less than 0.01). Seven patients had onset of symptoms at birth, with maximum tolerable volume in the rectum between 460 and 900 ml, and all were incontinent for feces. Studies of colonic transit times demonstrated normal function in the right and left colon, but there was rectosigmoid stagnation (transit time of 122 +/- 17 hr vs 8 +/- 2 in stress-free controls; X +/- SE; P less than 0.001). In the other 28 patients (late-onset megarectum), in contrast to the congenital group, there was a marked female preponderance, and their recorded stool frequency (4 +/- 0.7/week) was greater than the recalled frequency (1.4 +/- 0.2/week; P less than 0.001). Only half suffered from fecal incontinence. They did not have a greater rectal capacity when colonic transit times were prolonged (455 +/- 27 ml) than when normal (422 +/- 27). Rectal pressure was similar at the level of conscious sensation of filling, regardless of rectal capacity, suggesting a motor, rather than a sensory, abnormality. The amplitude of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was decreased (P less than 0.001) as compared to controls, sometimes mimicking the findings of Hirschsprung's disease, but increasing rectal distension always induced a relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. The notion of a megarectum, which tolerates large amounts of fluid without sensation, lacks elasticity, and is accompanied by an abnormal rectoanal inhibitory reflex, provides an explanation for one of the mechanisms of constipation by outlet obstruction.\r"

Since adenomas are believed to be precursors of colon cancer, we evaluated the association of cholecystectomy and adenomas in a case-control study. Cases were 244 patients with one or more adenomas who underwent colonoscopy at the North Carolina Memorial Hospital between May 1983 and August 1985. Controls were 281 patients without adenomas. Overall, cholecystectomy was found in 11.9% of cases and 10.3% of controls. White women with adenomas, however, were more likely to have had previous cholecystectomy than controls [odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.6]. Although women with adenomas were older and heavier than controls, the elevated odds ratio persisted after adjustment for these factors (OR 1.8; 95% CI 0.8-4.2). No association was observed for men or for nonwhite women. Cholecystectomy may predispose to colon adenomas and to colon cancer in some patients. Alternatively, common risk factors for gallstones, cholecystectomy, and colon cancer may explain the apparent risk of colon cancer or adenomas after cholecystectomy.\r"

Thyroid function, including thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations, T4/T3 ratio, and iodide uptake, of DBA and C57 mice were compared. Thyroid function was also assessed in relation to AGSS and severity in DBA mice. DBA mice have a larger thyroidal pool of iodide due to increased iodide uptake and possibly decreased release, but not to an increased organification rate. This increased iodide uptake exists until about 40 days of age. DBA mice also have a decreased radiochloride space and increased thyroid weight, indicative of enhanced TSH activity. The DBA mice show high T4 and TSH concentrations and a high T4/T3 ratio between the ages of 20 and 40 days. Beginning at 40 days of age the DBA mice have high T4, TSH, and T3 concentrations leading to a T4/T3 ratio approximating the C57 ratio. At any age, DBA mice demonstrating clonic/tonic seizures in response to auditory stimulation have hormone concentrations similar to their 21-day-old counterparts with seizures. Mice that show decreased response to auditory stimulation have hormone concentrations similar to the older age group. The increased thyroid activity of DBA mice is the result of enhanced TSH secretion. The increased TSH production is due to adaptations corresponding to the different age and AGSS. A decreased conversion of T4 to T3 by 3,3,5'-monodeiodinase, is responsible for the increase in TSH due to loss of T3 negative feedback on the anterior pituitary gland. By 40 days of age, the Type I 5'-deiodinase matures whereas the brain deiodinase activity remains subnormal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A possible mechanism for a pathological accumulation of QUIN being a deficiency in its degradation, we have measured the activity of quinolinic-phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRTase) (its first degradative enzyme) in stereo-EEG identified biopsies of human brain tissue. A specific reduction of QPRTase activity was observed in tissue primarily involved in the epileptic discharge compared to values from postmortem human brain tissue with no neurological disorders or nonpathological tissue from epileptic brains. A more severe decrease was noticed in the frontal and temporal cortices as compared to the amygdala or Ammon's horn. We suggest that this local deficit may contribute to the establishment or maintenance of an epileptic focus.\r"

Continuous lidocaine infusion (3.5 mg/kg/h) was used in one case with good results. Undesirable side effects were not seen. The basic mechanisms for possible anticonvulsant action are reviewed. Lidocaine seems to be an effective and safe drug in convulsive status epilepticus.

The life-table probability of having achieved 5 years seizure-free (FYSF) by 20 years after diagnosis was 75%. In a multivariable proportional hazards model, these three variables predicted a significantly higher rate of achieving FYSF: no early-life brain damage (remission rate ratio = 2.27, p less than 0.01), no generalized epileptiform activity (rate ratio = 1.58, p less than 0.05), and never having had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (rate ratio = 1.4, p less than 0.05). The same three variables, plus age at diagnosis, were descriptors of the rate of reaching FYSF off medication. Gender, family history, type of seizure, and EEG findings other than generalized epileptiform activity were not significantly related to either end point. The predictor set did 15% better than prior probabilities in forecasting FYSF. Although informative about group experience, these predictors are weak clinical discriminators, singly or in a set. FYSF occurred in high proportion of even those persons whose history, clinical examination, or EEG findings placed them in a less favorable stratum of one or more predictors.\r"

A literature survey revealed eight studies that had evaluated epileptiform patterns (EPs) in series of patients but none of these were derived from outpatients presenting for regular follow-up. Such EEG results are crucial for determining disability benefits that are often denied to people with normal records. We therefore randomly surveyed 100 adult outpatients attending the seizure follow-up clinic at Cook County Hospital. An EP was detected in 33 patients, 36 had normal records, and 31 had non-EP abnormalities. The presence of an EP was significantly related to an etiology of head injury, duration of epilepsy, age of onset before age 20 years, and receiving more than one antiepileptic drug (AED). The presence of an EP did not correlate with seizure frequency, seizure type, or presence of a neurological deficit. A prior EEG increased the proportion with an EP only to 41%. The relatively low proportion of people who demonstrated an EP suggests that (a) the presence of an EP on an EEG should not be a factor in deciding about disability benefits for individuals with epilepsy, and (b) that use of an EP as an eligibility criterion for entry into a research series is likely to generate a select group of patients, thus making it difficult to generalize results.\r"

Although pilomotor seizures may result from diverse etiologies, they appear to have a common involvement of temporolimbic structures.\r"

A disturbance in cerebral energy metabolism as expressed by the pyruvate pathway could be ruled out. Degenerative or ischemic lesions were not found. However, while the outer layers of the cortex were morphologically normal, the neurons of the inner layers (V and VI) showed a poor dendritic arborization and a diminished number of spines, which can be considered the basis of excessive excitability which in turn may further impair brain development. Thus, the neuromorphological findings suggest a causal rather then a consequential relation to LGS.\r"

Fluoroscopic catheterization techniques with selective salpingography demonstrated patency in 84% of obstructed tubes. Hysteroscopic cannulation with direct visualization by laparoscopy or laparotomy was successful in 92%. In one patient, perforation of the isthmus occurred without sequelae.

This study was concerned with assessing alternative policies for embryo transfer (ET). When three or fewer embryos were obtained in the IVF cycle, fresh embryo transfer was either excluded (group I, n = 69) or only one embryo was immediately transferred (group II, n = 46), the remainder being transferred after freezing and thawing. The pregnancy rate in these two policies was compared to that in a control group of patients (group III, n = 115) in whom all the embryos were transferred in the IVF cycle. The ongoing pregnancy rate was similar in all three groups. No multiple pregnancies occurred in groups I and II compared with one in the controls. The consequences of these policies for pregnancy rates and the incidence of multiple gestation are discussed. It is concluded that the deliberate limitation of fresh ET to a maximum of one embryo followed by one or more cycles of thawed frozen ET is not detrimental to the pregnancy rate and is less likely to be associated with multiple gestations. Conversely, this policy increases the workload of the laboratory staff and raises certain ethical questions.\r"

Follicular development was induced with a combination of clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) or follicle-stimulating hormone and hMG. Follicles were aspirated by TVA 36 hours after an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin 10,000 IU intramuscularly. A total of 169 oocytes were recovered (10.5 +/- 6.9 X +/- SD) from the 16 patients. There was failure of fertilization in 6 cases. In the remaining 10, a TET was performed 44 to 50 hours after TVA, utilizing embryos at the pronuclear stage. Six pregnancies resulted from the 10 transfers. This technique combines the advantages of proof of fertilization with a more adequate tubal embryo development and entrance to the uterine cavity that may determine and increase chance of implantation.\r"

Blood was obtained for hormone measurements immediately before and weekly for 14 weeks after the administration of the T microspheres. A biphasic release of hormone was observed; a significant increase in total T and free T concentration (compared to preinjection values) was observed during week 1 (P less than 0.01) and between weeks 6 and 11 after injection (P less than 0.05). A similar pattern was detected in estradiol and dihydrotestosterone concentrations, whereas T-binding globulin levels showed a small, reciprocal fall after the injection of microspheres (P = not significant [NS]). After receiving the T microspheres, seven of eight hypogonadal men reported the return of normal sexual function; the eight patient withdrew from the study after 5 weeks. It was concluded that T microspheres are a promising new method of androgen replacement therapy for hypogonadal men.\r"

In STZ-D rats, the basal rate of pancreatic juice flow was significantly increased (10.3 +/- 1.0 microliters/20 min) compared with control rats (4.4 +/- 0.2 microliters/20 min). The basal rate of amylase output as well as pancreatic amylase content were significantly decreased to less than 5% of control values. The basal rates of protein and trypsinogen outputs were similar in both groups. In both control and diabetic rats, secretin caused a dose-dependent increase in exocrine secretion. Secretin (10 pM to 10 nM) induced 1.1- to 11.7-fold increases in exocrine secretion in STZ-D rats. These increases were significantly lower than the 2.1- to 20.8-fold increases in control rats. Furthermore, there was no significant increase in exocrine secretion from STZ-D rats in response to 10 pM secretin, although this concentration of secretin caused a significant increase in control rats. Secretin-induced exocrine secretion in ALX-D rats was similar to that in STZ-D rats. In insulin-treated STZ-D rats, the basal rates of pancreatic secretion were not significantly different from those of control rats. These results suggest that insulin resistance in this patient was due to a circulating factor of low molecular weight that uncoupled insulin stimulation of glucose transport from receptor binding and phosphorylation. The factor appears to increase the binding activity of the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor without affecting the kinase activity of the beta-subunit.\r"

Similarly, using [125I]iodocyanopindolol as a ligand, we found a decrease in the beta-adrenergic-receptor number on cardiac plasma membrane isolated from the diabetic rats [29% decrease (P less than .05) at 1 wk, 50% (P less than .01) at 3 wk, and 49% (P less than .01) at 10 wk compared with control rats]. However, the serum triiodothyronine level that had been known to modulate the beta-adrenergic-receptor-adenylate cyclase system was decreased in the 1-wk-diabetic rats but not in the 10-wk-diabetic rats compared with each control group. Furthermore, there was no difference in urinary catecholamine excretion between diabetic and control groups. In the 10-wk-diabetic rats, the response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol was significantly defective (56% decrease compared with control rats; P less than .05), although both the basal and the forskolin-stimulated maximum adenylate cyclase activities and a half-maximum concentration of isoproterenol for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase were similar in control and diabetic rats. On the other hand, both cholera toxin-dependent and islet-activating protein-dependent [32P]NAD incorporations into cardiac plasma membrane were markedly increased in the diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Differential macromolecule clearances were used to elucidate the mechanism of proteinuria in patients with diabetic glomerulopathy. Uncharged dextrans of graded size, combined with albumin and IgG separated into narrow fractions of varying charge by preparative electrofocusing, were used to probe the filtration barrier. Analysis of the fractional clearance profile of dextrans in the 30- to 60-A interval revealed a small fraction of filtrate volume (0.0023-0.0097) permeating large nonrestrictive glomerular pores and correlating strongly with the fractional clearances of albumin (r = .88, P less than .001) or IgG (r = .91, P less than .001). The fractional clearance of the most anionic species of albumin [isoelectric point (pI) 4.0-4.5] significantly exceeded that of less anionic species (pI 4.5-5.5) at all levels of proteinuria. A corresponding increase in fractional clearance of anionic (pI 4.5-5.0) over neutral (pI 7.0-7.5) IgG species was observed in patients with subnephrotic-range proteinuria. We conclude that a loss of barrier size selectivity underlies proteinuria in diabetic glomerulopathy. In addition, either facilitated filtration of polyanions or preferential tubular reabsorption of polycations can be invoked to explain the final composition of urinary protein. Similar loss of size selectivity combined with enhanced fractional clearance of anionic IgG in a group of nondiabetic patients with nephrotic syndrome indicates that the foregoing abnormality of renal protein handling is not unique to diabetic glomerulopathy.\r"

DNA sequence analysis indicated that the HINSR promoter has neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box. The HINSR promoter region contains six GGGCGG sequences that may be binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. In addition, there were three TCCC sequences that were putative promoter regulatory regions. The HINSR gene promoter has structural similarity to the epidermal growth factor receptor gene promoter and has some features of the promoter of the meglutol (hydroxymethylglutaryl, HMG) CoA reductase gene and the early promoter of simian virus 40.\r"

  ".W": "The effect exerted by different hyperglycemic states on the pain threshold and on the analgesic potential of morphine was studied in male Sabra rats with the hot plate device. Hyperglycemia induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.014 mol/kg glucose or an acute or chronic diabetic state induced by streptozocin injection did not significantly alter the pain threshold. However, states of acute and chronic diabetes markedly blunted the analgesic effect of morphine (5 mg/kg). Sabra rats maintained on a cocktail of glucose-saccharin, thought to activate the release of endogenous opioids, demonstrated an increased pain threshold and rapidly developed resistance to the analgesic effect of morphine. Previous studies have shown that glucose in high concentration may interfere with the interaction of morphine on the opiate receptor. The influence of the diabetic state on beta-endorphin synthesis and concentration in the central nervous system is another factor that might change pain perception in diabetes. We propose that in diabetes, generally, the pain threshold is adequately maintained, despite the antagonistic effect of glucose, partly due to a compensatory increased secretion of endogenous opioid peptides. We hypothesize that in patients with chronic painful diabetic neuropathy, these normal analgesic response mechanisms may be overwhelmed either by an excess of nociceptive impulses from diseased peripheral nerves or conceivably by a failure of endogenous opioid secretory response to the hyperglycemia.\r"

The objective of the present study was to develop a simple and effective technique for isolating and culturing neurons of the enteric nervous system that would permit characterization of their development and regulatory peptide content. This was accomplished using a dispersed intestinal cell preparation cultured under conditions designed to support the growth and differentiation of neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Newborn hamster intestine was digested in 0.1% collagenase, mechanically dispersed, and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2.5% serum and other additives. Phase and bright-field microscopy demonstrated neuronal cells and fibers after the second day in culture. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against neurofilament and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Acetic acid extracts of the culture indicated that during the first 4 days of the culture the content of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide increased, whereas the content of substance P, mammalian bombesin, and neurotensin declined. High-performance liquid chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography confirmed that the immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal polypeptide coeluted with synthetic and iodinated forms of the peptide. This study describes a technique for primary culture of intestinal tissue that supports the survival of enteric neurons and permits analysis of the development and synthetic and secretory characteristics of the enteric nervous system.\r"

A parallel distribution was found of Leu5/Met5-enkephalin, measured with a Leu5-enkephalin antiserum that cross-reacts about 30% with Met5-enkephalin, and of Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7-immunoreactivity and Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-immunoreactivity. In each case, high tissue concentrations were present in the submucosa and muscularis corresponding to the pyloric sphincter. Taking all different regions together, a high correlation was revealed between tissue levels of Leu5/Met5-enkephalinlike peptides and Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-like peptides (r = 0.89), as well as between Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-like peptides and Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7-like peptides (r = 0.75). Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 immunoreactivity was accounted for by a major peak (87% +/- 3% of total immunoreactivity) coeluting with the standard peptide in Sephadex G-50 chromatography and largely composed of the authentic heptapeptide, as shown by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Leu5/Met5-enkephalin immunoreactivity was separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into peaks composed of Leu5-enkephalin and Met5-enkephalin. Allowing for Met5-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the assay used, the apparent Leu5/Met5-enkephalin molecular ratio was approximately 1:4. The high concentration of all peptides studied at the pyloric junction suggests a rich enkephalin-containing innervation at this level, in keeping with the proposed involvement of an enkephalinergic mechanism in the control of pyloric function.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic calcifications are virtually pathognomonic of chronic pancreatitis and develop in up to 90% of patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis in series with long-term results. We investigated the natural course of pancreatic calcification in a prospective longitudinal study over the past 23 yr. All patients were studied at regular intervals with particular regard to etiology, clinical findings, surgery, pancreatic function, and pancreatic calcification visible by x-ray (e.g., film series in three projections centered on the pancreas). We evaluated the findings of 107 patients with x-ray documentation of pancreatic calcification in at least three film series over a period of 4 yr or longer. Eighty-four patients had alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (group A) and 23 patients had nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis (group B). Four hundred seventy-two film series of group A and one hundred forty-two film series of group B were reviewed independently by two expert teams. Both series were graded according to a score system in terms of intensity and distribution of pancreatic calcification (correlation of grading r = 0.91). The duration of calcification averaged 10 yr in group A and 12.6 yr in group B. Similar dynamic changes of pancreatic calcification were noted in groups A and B. Chronologically, three phases of evolution could be distinguished. After an initial increase (phase 1), greater than 50% of cases reached a plateau of stationary calcification (phase 2). Approximately one-third of cases showed a marked decrease of calcification in late phases of chronic pancreatitis (phase 3). Dissolution of pancreatic stones was related primarily to duration of chronic pancreatitis (duration of calcification and marked pancreatic dysfunction), and occurred frequently (but not exclusively) in patients after ductal drainage procedures. These results indicate that spontaneous dissolution of pancreatic stones is a rather common biologic phenomenon. The factors responsible for dissolution of stones remain to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "We have tested the hypothesis that the greater clinical efficacy of bedtime administration of bile acid in gallstone dissolution is due to prevention of the reduction in hepatic bile acid secretion that normally accompanies overnight interruption of the enterohepatic circulation, thus also reducing the secretion of supersaturated hepatic bile. We measured the hepatic bile acid secretion rate by combining duodenal perfusion of a nonabsorbable recovery marker (polyethylene glycol) with continuous intravenous infusion of a hepatic bile marker (indocyanine green). We studied 6 subjects with gallstones before and during administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 675 mg) at bedtime. Duplicate pretreatment studies revealed good reproducibility. Mean values for hepatic bile acid secretion rate were uninfluenced by chronic UDCA administration before the acute bedtime dose, but during the 4-h period after acute administration of UDCA the total bile acids secreted increased by a mean value of 2.2 mmol (p less than 0.01). Before treatment, nine of the 78 hourly samples were secreted at a hepatic bile acid secretion rate of less than 5 mumol/kg.h in the 6 patients studied, compared with only one hourly sample during UDCA administration. Super-saturated hepatic bile was secreted for a mean of 9.5 h before treatment, and for 1.2 h during UDCA treatment (p less than 0.005). We conclude that if UDCA is administered at bedtime, this maintains the hepatic bile acid secretion rate overnight, thus reducing secretion of supersaturated hepatic bile, in addition to the well-established effect of UDCA on cholesterol secretion.\r"

In a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial, 39 patients received penicillamine (250 mg t.i.d.) and 31 received a placebo. The two groups were highly comparable at entry with regard to clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and hepatic histologic features. Although a predictable cupruresis and a decrease in levels of hepatic copper were achieved in patients taking penicillamine, there was no beneficial effect on disease progression within 36 mo or on overall survival. Progressive symptoms, deterioration in serial hepatic laboratory values, or histologic progression on sequential liver biopsy specimens were similar in both groups, occurring in greater than 80% of the entire study population. The development of major side effects led to the permanent discontinuation of penicillamine in 21% of the patients taking the drug. We conclude that the use of penicillamine in primary sclerosing cholangitis is not associated with a beneficial effect on disease progression or survival, and has considerable toxicity. The study also suggests that primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive disease in many patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of human donor livers indicate an association between ex vivo hepatocellular adenosine triphosphate and posttransplant graft function. To test the hypothesis that prior glucose loading of donor liver would optimize its adenosine triphosphate production and adenylate energy charge during ex vivo organ preservation, adult male rats were randomized to receive either intravenous dextrose or saline for 44 h. After this infusion, a liver lobe was exposed and freeze-clamped (time 0). The remaining liver was quickly flushed, excised, and stored in Collins' II solution at 2 degrees C for 8 h. Additional lobes were freeze-clamped at 1, 4, and 8 h. Liver adenosine triphosphate, total nucleoside triphosphates, and energy charge losses were significantly reduced in the dextrose-treated rats in comparison with saline-treated rats during the first 4 h of preservation. Although the livers from rats receiving intravenous dextrose were able to generate lactate, their glycogen stores were not utilized appreciably, suggesting that exogenous glucose served as a substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Unesterified choline levels of the fasted rat livers were significantly higher than those from the rats receiving intravenous dextrose by the first hour, indicative of increased membrane breakdown. These results indicate that prior infusion of glucose enhances the capacity of the ex vivo liver, presumably through the induction and stabilization of key glycolytic enzymes, to anaerobically generate adenosine triphosphate. Administration of glucose to liver donors before organ procurement may improve post-transplant graft function by reducing the loss of hepatocellular energy, retarding membrane damage, and fostering glycogen storage for use in the early postoperative period.\r"

In patients with SO dyskinesia 20 mg of nifedipine also resulted in a significant but more profound decrease of the basal SO pressure from 47.1 to 17.3 mmHg as well as in a decrease of amplitude, duration, and frequency of the phasic contractions. Neither placebo nor 10 or 20 mg of nifedipine has any effect on the sequence of phasic contractions. In summary, nifedipine may have a possible therapeutic role in the treatment of SO dyskinesia.\r"

To determine whether any clinical or histologic features distinguish alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects with \"alcohollike\" liver injury, the clinical records and liver biopsy specimens of 68 alcoholic and 39 nonalcoholic patients with alcohollike injury on liver biopsy were compared. The clinical and biochemical features of the two groups differed significantly. Alcoholism was associated with more severe clinical and biochemical manifestations of liver disease. However, there was considerable overlap among histologic features of the two clinically defined groups. Based on histology alone, alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients were often indistinguishable. The observations suggest that the clinical differences between the alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients cannot be attributed to qualitative or quantitative differences in liver histology. On the other hand, histologic similarities between the two groups raise the possibility that a shared condition, perhaps nutritional or hormonal, is responsible for the histologic expression of alcohollike injury in both groups.\r"

At initial studies, 5 patients had normal pancreatic function, and the remaining 27 had pancreatic insufficiency, which was mild to moderate in most subjects. The final studies, carried out at an average of 7.3 yr (range, 4-11 yr) after the first, showed a significant deterioration in pancreatic function, both in patients who stopped alcohol after the initial study (n = 18) and in those who did not (n = 14). The deterioration, however, was significantly less marked in patients who stopped drinking alcohol than in those who continued. These data indicate that pancreatic functional changes caused by alcoholic pancreatitis progress even after cessation of alcohol use; however, the progression is slower and less severe when alcohol intake is stopped.\r"

The role of the GB and sphincter of Oddi (SO) in the partition of hepatic biliary output between GB and duodenum was studied in 6 dogs during the interdigestive and postprandial periods. Three animals received a continuous intravenous infusion of [14C]taurocholic acid, which served as a marker of the steady-state hepatic output of radiolabeled bile acid. Gallbladder filling and emptying and duodenal delivery of [14C]taurocholic acid were determined using duodenal marker perfusion to measure output. Sphincter of Oddi, common duct, GB, and duodenal manometry was performed in 3 additional dogs. During fasting, partial GB emptying and an increased rate of duodenal delivery occurred between 60% and 90% of each cycle of the migrating motor complex. The majority of hepatic taurocholic acid output was stored in the GB during the first half of the migrating myoelectric complex. However, in the latter half of the migrating myoelectric complex, the frequency of SO contractions and basal SO pressure decreased, GB pressure increased, net partial GB emptying occurred, and peak rates of duodenal taurocholic acid delivery were achieved. Feeding induced immediate decreases in basal SO pressure and frequency of phasic contractions, and an immediate increase of GB pressure. Gallbladder emptying and duodenal taurocholic acid delivery were maximal in the first 10 min after feeding. Thus, both the cyclic interdigestive and immediate postprandial increases in duodenal bile acid delivery are associated with SO relaxation and GB contraction. The immediate postprandial changes in SO and GB motility, and in duodenal bile acid output, suggest a cephalic phase of postprandial duodenal bile acid delivery.\r"

Motilin at doses of up to 1 microgram/kg had no effect on gallbladder motility. Increasing doses of intraarterial motilin (32-256 ng/kg) caused an increase in tonic pressures and in the force of phasic contractions of the sphincter of Oddi (p less than 0.001). Simultaneous measurements of myoelectric activity and transphincteric flow showed that motilin caused an increase in the frequency of spike bursts with a concomitant dose-dependent decrease in flow (p less than 0.001). The action of motilin was unaffected by extrinsic denervation (cervical vagotomy or splanchnicectomy), hexamethonium, and propranolol. Atropine, methysergide, or phentolamine partially blocked the excitatory effect of motilin (p less than 0.05), whereas tetrodotoxin, a combination of atropine and methysergide, or naloxone completely blocked its effects (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that (a) motilin decreases sphincter of Oddi flow by increasing its motor activity and (b) motilin activates an intramural excitatory pathway that appears to consist of opiate, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurons.\r"

Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive diffuse polyclonal IgA (99%)-plasma cell infiltration in the small bowel mucosa, with a smaller increase of IgA-producing cells in gastric and colonic mucosae. Secretory IgA levels were normal in jejunal and bronchoalveolar secretions. However, both fluids contained polymeric IgA devoid of secretory component, and free secretory component was absent. This suggests that secretory component was the limiting factor in transport of IgA in the secretions. A relative deficiency in secretory component, as compared with the huge supply of polymeric IgA, may have limited the secretory component-mediated active transport of IgA into secretions. This resulted in the appearance of high levels of polymeric IgA, unlinked to secretory component, both in serum and in the jejunal and bronchoalveolar fluids.\r"

Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity is markedly reduced in patients with this disorder. Although porphyria cutanea tarda may be familial, it is more often sporadic in occurrence, and has been associated with excess alcohol ingestion, estrogen administration, iron overload, and several environmental hepatotoxins. It has also been associated on occasion with malignancy. We report a 46-yr-old woman with ovarian carcinoma who developed porphyria cutanea tarda while undergoing treatment with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. The temporal course of the porphyrin abnormality suggested that cyclophosphamide was the pathogenic agent, and symptoms regressed after cessation of this drug with continued administration of cisplatin. The pathogenesis of the porphyria is not clear; however, cyclophosphamide is a substrate for cytochrome P450, and may produce metabolites that destroy this protein. The resulting increased turnover of heme might then result in overproduction of porphyrin precursors, resulting in the clinical syndrome. Studies of porphyrin metabolism in patients treated with cyclophosphamide may help to elucidate this possibility.\r"

There was no evidence of Q fever, Hodgkin's disease, cytomegalovirus hepatitis, or allopurinol treatment, which are the recognized causes of hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. This report extends the range of etiologies of hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. As a result, leishmaniasis should always be a consideration to the pathologist and the clinician in the differential diagnosis of fibrin-ring granulomas.\r"

Moreover, we hypothesized that terbutaline might inhibit food-stimulated acid secretion, as gastrin is a major mediator of food-stimulated acid secretion. Subcutaneous terbutaline (0.25 mg) reduced acid secretion during intravenous infusion of a submaximal dose of pentagastrin by 30%-40% (p less than 0.005), even though terbutaline increased serum gastrin levels (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, subcutaneous (0.25 mg) or oral (5 mg) terbutaline, given before a homogenized steak meal was infused into the stomach, lowered mean food-stimulated acid secretion rates, despite enhanced postprandial serum gastrin concentrations. Terbutaline also increased serum gastrin concentrations in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in vagotomized individuals. Thus, beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonists enhance gastrin release while at the same time inhibiting gastrin-stimulated acid secretion in humans.\r"

In contrast to beef protein, the effects of soy protein on gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin concentration have not been evaluated. We compared the effects of meals containing the same amounts of either isolated soy or beef protein on acid secretion and serum gastrin concentration in normal humans. Acid secretion measured by in vivo intragastric titration was 30%-40% less with soy than beef protein (p less than 0.05), whether isolated soy protein alone was compared with a mixed beef meal containing carbohydrate and fat or whether soy or beef meals containing similar amounts of fat were compared. Average gastrin rises were 65%-75% less with soy than with beef (p less than 0.01). The explanation for less gastrin release with soy than with beef is unclear, but lower serum gastrin concentrations with soy probably accounted for reduced acid secretion. These results indicate that the source of dietary protein in a meal may be an important determinant of gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal hormone release.\r"

One hour after feeding, 28.6% +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD) of the solid phase and 27.1% +/- 8.6% of the liquid phase of the meal had been emptied. Both U-50488 and tifluadom given orally (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased (p less than 0.05) the 1-h emptying of the solid phase of the meal by 23.1%-49.6%. In contrast, both drugs significantly reduced emptying of liquids. These effects were not reproduced when similar doses were given intravenously. Oral administration of morphine or DAGO (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) did not affect gastric emptying, whereas an inhibited emptying of solids was observed for morphine at a higher dose (1 mg/kg p.o.). At a dose of 100 micrograms/kg i.v. both naloxone and MR 2266 (0.1 mg/kg) abolished the effects of orally administered U-50488 on gastric emptying of solids and liquids. It is concluded that kappa- but not mu-agonists act locally to alter gastric emptying of a standard meal in dogs, having opposite effects on solid and liquid phases. A selective local stimulation of kappa mucosal or submucosal receptors of the gastroduodenal area may explain such effects.\r"

Of 155 patients, 15.5% had Giardia. Patients with dyspepsia, with or without obvious lesions at endoscopy, had a similar prevalence. Patients with vomiting and diarrhea had an increased prevalence (38.5%) (p less than 0.05). The prevalence of Giardia lamblia in this patient population is surprisingly high. This study suggests that Giardia lamblia infection is not a major cause of nonulcer dyspepsia.\r"

We compared the in vitro effects of azodisalicylate, sulfasalazine, and 5-aminosalicylic acid on rabbit intestinal electrolyte transport. Distal ileal mucosae mounted in Ussing chambers were exposed to varying concentrations of the drugs. Mucosal addition of azodisalicylate (greater than 5 mM) caused the greatest anion-dependent increase in short-circuit current of 83 microA/cm2 (ED50 = 0.3 mM). Isotope flux measurements suggest that azodisalicylate may stimulate predominantly electrogenic HCO3 secretion and induces net NaCl secretion. In contrast, serosal addition of azodisalicylate and sulfasalazine (greater than 5 mM) decreased short-circuit current, and 5-aminosalicylic acid had no effect. Azodisalicylate had no effect on ion transport in distal colon. The effects of azodisalicylate in ileum were not inhibited with piroxicam (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase). Mucosal cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels were unchanged after ileal exposure to azodisalicylate. Azodisalicylate appears to be a mechanistically unusual secretagogue, possibly explaining the increased incidence of diarrhea seen in patients taking the drug.\r"

  ".U": "88313534\r", 
  ".W": "The indirect, noninvasive technique of breath hydrogen (H2) analysis was evaluated in 45 patients suspected of having bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth, defined as a jejunal culture yielding at least 10(5) organisms/ml, was present in 27 patients. After dietary preparation and a 12-h fast, subjects received in random order and on separate days 50 g of glucose or 50 g of rice flour in the form of two pancakes. Normal values were established in 20 healthy controls. Twelve of 27 patients with proven bacterial overgrowth had an elevated (greater than 15 ppm) fasting breath H2 level on at least 1 test day. Fifteen of 18 patients with negative cultures had low fasting breath H2 levels. Based on values in controls, a positive breath test was defined as an increase in breath H2 of greater than or equal to 12 ppm after glucose or greater than or equal to 14 ppm after rice flour. A 2-h glucose breath H2 test had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 78% in the diagnosis of overgrowth. The predictive value of a positive test was 86% and that of a negative test was 88%. The combination of both a high fasting breath H2 level and a diagnostic rise of breath H2 after glucose was present in 41% of patients with overgrowth and in none of the patients without overgrowth. Extending the test to 4 h did not increase sensitivity, but decreased specificity. Rice flour was a less satisfactory substrate in predicting the presence of bacterial overgrowth. In conclusion, a high fasting breath H2 level after dietary preparation suggests bacterial overgrowth but lacks sensitivity. The finding of a rise in breath H2 of at least 12 ppm within 2 h of a 50-g glucose challenge is a simple screen for bacterial overgrowth. The combined criteria of a high fasting breath H2 level and a significant rise after glucose are specific for bacterial overgrowth.\r"

  ".U": "88313535\r", 
  ".W": "Autologous technetium 99m-labeled phagocyte scanning has been used to assess disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease in 51 consecutive patients. Strong correlations were found between the 24-h fecal excretion of isotope and the histologic score of mucosal biopsy specimens (rS = 0.84, p less than 0.001, where rS is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient), and between the 24-h fecal excretion of isotope and a clinical inflammatory bowel disease activity index based on the Crohn's disease activity index (rS = 0.87, p less than 0.001). To develop a clinically useful and objective measure of inflammatory bowel disease activity that did not require a 24-h stool collection, the intensity of bowel uptake on scanning was graded visually from 0 to 4, a ratio of count rates for the region of interest to the iliac crest reference region was calculated, and the rapidity of labeled phagocyte uptake into inflamed bowel was measured as the peak uptake time. Visual grading of disease activity on the scans was validated by comparing it with the ratio of count rates from inflamed bowel regions of interest and those from the iliac crest reference region. The ratio of count rates showed a significant correlation with the clinical disease activity index (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). The visual scan grade also correlated well with the clinical activity index (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). Count rates from hourly scans were also used to calculate the time of peak uptake of counts for a given region of interest. There was a strong negative correlation between this peak uptake time and the fecal excretion of isotope (rS = -0.81, p less than 0.001), a clinical activity index (r = -0.60, p less than 0.001), and the histologic score of the mucosal biopsy specimens (r = -0.84, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that the technetium 99m-labeled phagocyte scan provides an objective assessment of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease using the visual scan grade, ratio of count rates for the region of inflamed bowel, or by the peak uptake time, thereby avoiding the problems associated with fecal collections. This scanning test may prove to be of significant value in clinical management and in the assessment of treatment response.\r"

All the incontinent subjects, but none of the controls, had evidence of pudendal neuropathy. Surface electromyography studies of the internal anal sphincter showed absence of electrical activity in 4 of 6 incontinent subjects; in the remaining 2 subjects and in 6 of 7 controls normal slow waves were present. Internal sphincter muscle strips from control subjects showed normal in vitro responses to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, dimethyl-phenylpiperazinium, and electrical field stimulation; muscle strips from the incontinent patients showed complete insensitivity except in 2 patients in whom there was contraction to noradrenaline and relaxation to isoprenaline. Electron microscopy showed normal smooth muscle in 5 control subjects and minor changes in 1 subject; all the incontinent patients showed abnormalities in the smooth muscle cells of the internal anal sphincter.

The mean survival of the group was 7 months (range, 3 days to 27 months). This new technique provides both intraluminal brachytherapy and biliary drainage and is inserted intraduodenally across the papilla of Vater avoiding puncture of the liver and external hardware required by the percutaneous technique and hardware necessitated with a nasobiliary tube. Following removal of the iridium prosthesis, a large caliber endoprosthesis is inserted for continued decompression. Because of proven efficacy of endoprostheses, this new technique should be considered when intraluminal irradiation is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out a double-blinded, randomized prospective study to compare patient tolerance of small diameter endoscopes using limited potency oral premedication to complement topical anesthesia. Patients randomly received either oral placebo, diphenhydramine (100 mg), acetaminophen (1000 mg), or both drugs 30 to 60 min prior to endoscopy. All patients received topical Cetacaine and underwent upper endoscopy with the Olympus XP10 7.9-mm fiberscope. The combination of acetaminophen (1000 mg) and diphenhydramine (100 mg) significantly improved tolerance over topical anesthetic alone. Obvious sedation from the medications was infrequent. Gag response after a topical anesthesia was a significant predictor of patient tolerance. We conclude that small diameter endoscopes are well tolerated for diagnostic upper endoscopy. Oral premedications additionally improve tolerance slightly.\r"

Patients were studied recumbent, for one hour before and four hours after a standard meal. Transient LOS relaxation was the most prevalent mechanism and overall accounted for 82% of reflux episodes. With increasing severity of oesophagitis, absent basal LOS pressure became a progressively more common mechanism, accounting for 23% of episodes in the patients with severe oesophagitis. Patients commonly exhibited more than one mechanism. The timing of most (69%) LOS relaxations associated with reflux was not compatible with triggering by swallowing. Prolonged transient LOS relaxations were associated with inhibition of oesophageal peristalsis suggesting that this response is produced by neural inhibition. This study suggests the primary importance of transient LOS relaxations as the cause of GOR across the spectrum of severity of reflux disease.\r"

A positive response, defined as symptom reproduction with or without abnormal motility, was present in 21 patients (35%) after acid perfusion and 12 (20%) after edrophonium. Eleven of the 12 patients responding to edrophonium also responded to acid perfusion, including most of the patients with primary motility disorders. Significantly greater increases in peristaltic duration, but not amplitude, were recorded after edrophonium (p less than 0.01) and acid perfusion (p less than 0.05) in positive responders, compared with non-responders. Results indicate that acid perfusion during oesophageal manometry may be a more useful stress test than edrophonium and that the mechanism of symptom production may be similar.\r"

  ".U": "88313695\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that ileal infusion of partially digested triglyceride inhibits jejunal motility. The partial digest used in those studies contained a mixture of glycerol, free fatty acid, mono-, di-, and triglycerides. In Part I of the present study we have separately infused emulsions containing either glycerol 3.1 g (n = 6), oleic acid 9.6 g (n = 6), triolein 10 g (n = 12), or medium chain triglycerides 10 g (n = 6) into the ileum and have recorded the effect this has on jejunal motility. Five further subjects received infusions of partial hydrolysates of corn starch 10 g and lactalbumin 7 g. Marked inhibition of jejunal pressure wave activity was seen after all three lipid infusions, per cent activity falling from a control of 37.7 (7.7) to 6.2 (2.1) and 22.4 (8.2)% 30 min after completing the oleic acid and triolein infusions respectively, and from a control value of 39.5 (4.1) to 17.7 (4.7) after MCTs (all p less than 0.05). No significant fall occurred after infusion of glycerol, protein or carbohydrate. All three lipid infusions raised plasma concentrations of neurotensin, enteroglucagon and peptide YY equally effectively, although only the rise in peptide YY correlated significantly with the inhibition of jejunal pressure wave activity (r = 0.80, n = 6, p less than 0.05). In Part II of this study six subjects received a 3 ml/min jejunal infusion of an isotonic carbohydrate saline solution followed after three hours by a similar infusion of a partial digest of lipid. During each infusion flow and transit time was measured by marker and dye dilution. Jejunal infusion of the carbohydrate-saline solution was associated with low jejunal flow, 4.7 (1.0) ml/min and a mean transit time through the 50 cm study segment of 36.5 (7.1) min. By contrast jejunal infusion of partially digested triglyceride was associated with a markedly increased flow, 9.0 (1.2) ml/min, a fall in mean transit time to 20.3 (2.6) min and significant rises in pancreaticobiliary secretions. Jejunal triglyceride also increased the incidence of prolonged high amplitude jejunal pressure waves in four of six subjects. These studies suggest that there are important differences in the jejunal response to ileal versus jejunal lipid. While long and median chain free fatty acids infused into the ileum exert an inhibitory effect on jejunal motility, when infused directly into the jejunum partially digested triglyceride accelerates transit, increases jejunal flow and subtly alters the pattern of jejunal contractions.\r"

In normal intestine, absorption of water was greater (108 (8.1) microliters/min/g; p less than 0.01) and sodium secretion less (-4.3 (0.3) mumol/min/g; p less than 0.01) from the oral rehydration solution containing bicarbonate than from the solution in which bicarbonate was replaced by chloride ions (59.5 (7.2) microliters/min/g and -7.8 (0.8) mumol/min/g, respectively). Glucose absorption in normal intestine was similar with both solutions. In the secreting intestine, both oral rehydration solutions reversed net water secretion to absorption, but inclusion of bicarbonate resulted in significantly less net absorption of both water (2.18 (6.9) microliters/min/g; p less than 0.05) and glucose (18.7 (2.1) mumol/min/g; p less than 0.001) compared with bicarbonate free oral rehydration solution (19.4 (3.9) microliters/min/g and 35.8 (3.7) mumol/min/g, respectively). Net sodium secretion occurred in normal and secreting intestine but was significantly less with the bicarbonate containing oral rehydration solution. These findings suggest that the demonstrable advantage of bicarbonate in promoting water absorption from this oral rehydration solution in normal rat intestine does not apply to cholera toxin treated secreting intestine.\r"

We studied the activities of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, epoxide hydrolase, and glutathione peroxidase in 242 peroral small intestinal biopsy samples of children aged eight months to 18 years: 201 with normal histology, 21 with partial villous atrophy, and 20 with severe villous atrophy. All these enzymes were detectable even in the youngest children. The aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was age dependent, while the other measured enzyme activities were not related to the age of the patients. The aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was not related to the mucosal histology, but the epoxide hydrolase and glutathione peroxidase activities were diminished in samples with severe villous atrophy as compared with normal mucosa. This suggests that small intestinal mucosa with villous atrophy may produce oxidated, reactive metabolites, but further metabolism into detoxication products is decreased. This may expose persons with mucosal atrophy to possible harmful effects of environmental xenobiotics entering the body even at low doses.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate local humoral immunity in ulcerative colitis (UC), immunoglobulin (Ig) contents and net Ig production in vitro was assessed using organ cultures of colonic biopsies from 21 patients with quiescent disease and 11 controls. Ig was estimated by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for IgA, secretory IgA (sIgA), IgM, and IgG. In parallel, numbers of IgA plasma cells were estimated by indirect immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections for IgA. IgA was the dominant Ig isotype found pre-existing in colonic mucosae, and secreted in vitro. In UC patients, preformed tissue IgA and IgA produced in vitro were significantly increased compared with controls. There was no concomitant increase in amounts of sIgA synthesised in culture, however, although numbers of IgA plasma cells were increased in UC patients by an amount comparable with the increased in vitro IgA production. These results directly show a dysfunction of transepithelial IgA secretion in quiescent ulcerative colitis. Despite a significantly raised concentration of tissue IgG in UC patients, little was produced in vitro in patient and control groups alike, suggesting that mucosal IgG was serum derived, and not linked to local IgA production.\r"

Peroral intubation of the right colon was achieved using a fine polyvinylchloride (PVC) tube. Bisacodyl was used to initiate colonic motor activity, and colonic transit was monitored using 99mTc-DPTA and a gamma camera. In normal subjects there was rapid movement of the radiopharmaceutical from the right colon to the rectum. In patients with severe idiopathic constipation, a spectrum of colonic abnormality was observed from slow transit involving the rectum and sigmoid only to slow transit involving the whole colon. The hepatic flexure to rectum transit time for the 'head of the isotope column' in normals ranged from 1-10 minutes (mean 5.3 minutes), whereas in patients the transit time was 14-25 minutes in four patients and radioisotope did not reach the rectum by two hours in three other patients (controls v patients, p less than 0.01). Patients also showed relatively impaired transport of the isotope 'mass'. This technique has shown that the normal colon is capable of rapid effective transport in response to a standard stimulus, and that patients with severe idiopathic constipation have a definable colonic motor disorder.\r"

Using sucrose gradient centrifugation, the highest concentrations of cRABP were found in pancreatic carcinoma tissues, ranging from 5.5-23.9 pmol/mg protein. These concentrations were markedly different than in chronic pancreatitis tissue (0.7-2.7 pmol/mg protein). Saturation analysis of cRABP showed a mean dissociation constant of 21.5 nM and maximum binding sites of 5.2 pmol/mg protein. Cytosolic retinoic acid binding protein was separated at an isoelectric point of 4.5 on agarose gel.

  ".W": "Liver damage was induced in rats by injection of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Fibrin clots were observed in the hepatic sinusoids at 12 hours and soluble fibrin monomer complexes were markedly detected at 24 hours only in the rats given DMN. When antithrombin III concentrate was infused at 12 hours there was a dose dependent improvement of the values of serum total bilirubin, SGPT, prothrombin time, peripheral platelet count, and plasma fibrinogen and coagulation factor VIIIC and of the histological degree of liver injury at 24 hours in the DMN group. The CCl4-group showed no such improvement. Intravascular coagulation may complicate the course of certain types of acute liver injury and contribute to its aggravation in rats. Under such circumstances, treatment with antithrombin III concentrate would be beneficial.\r"

Thorough manual cleaning with detergent, of the instrument and its channels is the most important part of the cleaning/disinfection procedure. Without this, blood, mucus and organic material will prevent adequate penetration of disinfectant for inactivation of bacteria and viruses. 3. Aldehyde preparations (2% activated glutaraldehyde and related products) are the recommended first line antibacterial and antiviral disinfectant. A four minute soak is recommended as sufficient for inactivation of vegetative bacteria and viruses (including HIV and HBV). 4. Quaternary ammonium detergents (8% Dettox for two minutes for bacterial disinfection), followed by exposure of the endoscope shaft and channels to ethyl alcohol (70% for four minutes for viral inactivation), is an acceptable second-line disinfectant routine where staff sensitisation prevents the use of an aldehyde disinfectant. 5. Accessories, including mouthguards and cleaning brushes, require similarly careful cleaning/disinfection, before and after each use. Disposable products (especially injection needles) may be used and appropriate items can be sterilised by autoclaving and kept in sterile packs. 6. Closed circuit endoscope washing machines have advantages in maintaining standards and avoiding staff sensitisation to disinfectants. Improved ventilation including exhaust extraction facilities may be required. 7. Endoscopy staff should receive HBV vaccination, wear gloves and appropriate protective garments, cover wounds or abrasions and avoid needlestick injuries (including spiked forceps, etc). 8. Known HIV-infected or AIDS patients are managed as immunosuppressed, and require protection from atypical mycobacteria/cryptosporidia etc, by one hour aldehyde disinfection of endoscopic equipment before and after the procedure. A dedicated instrument is not required. 9. Increased funding is necessary for capital purchases of GI endoscopic equipment, including extra and immersible endoscopes with additional accessories to allow for safe practice. 10. Greater numbers of trained GI assistants are needed to ensure that cleaning/disinfection recommendations and safety precautions are followed, both during routine lists and emergency endoscopic procedures. 11. These recommendations are based on expert interpretation of current data on infectivity and disinfection; they may require future modification.\r"

To test the hypothesis that this dissimilarity may reflect a difference between the two strains in adenosine transport or metabolism, we compared the kinetics of nucleoside transport (i.e., [3H]uridine uptake) in erythrocytes and the pulmonary disposition of [3H]adenosine in SHR versus WKY. [3H]Uridine uptake in rat erythrocytes was linear for 4 minutes and inhibitable with dipyridamole. Kinetic analysis (i.e., Hofstee plots) of initial uptake velocity indicated no difference between the two strains with respect to apparent Km (196 +/- 40 vs 230 +/- 29 microM in WKY and SHR, respectively) and maximum velocity (7.5 +/- 0.4 vs 8.3 +/- 0.5 pmol/2 min/12% Hct in WKY and SHR, respectively). Approximately 50% of [3H]adenosine infused into the pulmonary artery of perfused rat lung was transported into the lung, and 85% of this material was incorporated into the nucleotide pool. Radioactivity in the lung perfusate consisted initially of equal amounts of adenosine and inosine; however, within 60 seconds after administration of [3H]adenosine most of the effluent radioactivity was inosine. No differences were detected in adenosine uptake, intracellular metabolism, or extracellular metabolism in lung from SHR versus WKY. Our data indicate that any difference between SHR and WKY with respect to the biological response to adenosine cannot be attributed to differences in adenosine disposition and, therefore, must be due to pharmacodynamic differences between the strains.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the heart as well as the activity and the sensitivity of the phosphoinositide pathway on tissue slices of atria, ventricles, and femoral artery of hypertensive rats treated for 4 weeks with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and 1% saline. DOCA-salt hypertensive rats were characterized by an increased sympathoadrenal tone, as suggested by increased norepinephrine and epinephrine plasma levels. The basal activity of the phosphoinositide pathway, estimated by measuring the accumulation of inositol monophosphate in the presence of an excess of lithium, was found to be greater in atria than in ventricles and femoral artery in both normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, but it was twofold greater in atria and ventricles of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with normotensive rats. Following stimulation by norepinephrine, the production of inositol monophosphate was greater in atria and femoral artery than in ventricles in both groups. However, in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, the production of inositol monophosphate was markedly enhanced, being about twofold greater in atria and femoral artery and about three times greater in ventricles than in tissues of normotensive rats. These differences between DOCA-salt hypertensive and normotensive animals do not appear to be associated with a difference in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number or affinity since cardiac alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number was unchanged in hypertensive rats and the binding affinity to the receptor was significantly decreased in hypertensive rats compared with normotensive rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was initiated to see if the insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension that follow feeding normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats a fructose-rich diet could be prevented by letting rats run spontaneously in exercise wheel cages. Blood pressure in sedentary rats increased from (mean +/- SEM) 125 +/- 2 to 148 +/- 3 mm Hg in response to 2 weeks of a high fructose diet, and this increment was significantly (p less than 0.001) attenuated in exercising rats (from 121 +/- 1 to 131 +/- 2 mm Hg). In addition, mean (+/- SEM) plasma insulin concentration was lower in fructose-fed rats allowed to run spontaneously (44 +/- 2 vs 62 +/- 5 microU/ml; p less than 0.01). Finally, resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was assessed by determining the steady state plasma glucose response to a continuous glucose and exogenous insulin infusion during a period in which endogenous insulin secretion was suppressed. The results of these studies indicated that the mean (+/- SEM) steady state plasma glucose concentration was significantly lower in the exercise-trained rats (127 +/- 5 vs 168 +/- 6 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), despite the fact that the steady state plasma insulin levels were also lower in rats allowed to run spontaneously (75 +/- 4 vs 90 +/- 5 microU/ml; p less than 0.05). Thus, the ability of exercise-trained rats to stimulate glucose disposal was enhanced as compared with that of sedentary rats fed the same fructose-rich diet. These data demonstrate that the insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension produced in normotensive rats by feeding them a high fructose diet can be attenuated if rats are allowed to run spontaneously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88314225\r", 
  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine what factors might contribute to arterial supersensitivity to norepinephrine associated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension in the rat. Experimental groups of male rats were uninephrectomized and 1 week later began receiving twice weekly injections of DOCA (20 mg/kg s.c. in sesame oil) plus 1% NaCl and 0.2% KCl in their drinking water. For each experimental group, a group of age-matched male rats underwent a sham operation and received injections of sesame oil and the NaCl-KCl drinking water. Perfused caudal arteries from 3-week-hypertensive rats were supersensitive to intraluminal and extraluminal norepinephrine administration. However, this difference in sensitivity between hypertensive and control caudal arteries was demonstrable at low rates of perfusion, 0.5 to 1.0 ml/min, but not at rates of 2.0 to 2.6 ml/min. The supersensitivity was not due to differences in neuronal uptake or to inhibition of extraneuronal uptake by DOCA. The perfused mesenteric vascular bed from 3- or 6-week-hypertensive rats was also supersensitive to intraluminal norepinephrine. However, the demonstration of supersensitivity in the mesenteric vasculature was independent of perfusion rate (2.3-6.8 ml/min) and perfusion pressure in the range of 30 to 60 mm Hg. There was little or no supersensitivity to transmural nerve stimulation in either the caudal artery or the mesenteric vasculature, a finding consistent with the observed decrease in endogenous norepinephrine content. Microelectrodes were used to determine resting membrane potential in the smooth muscle cells. No differences in resting membrane potential were detected between caudal or mesenteric arteries from hypertensive compared with control rats 2, 3, or 6 weeks after initiation of the DOCA-salt regimen. It is concluded that 1) the perfusion rate is a critical factor in designing experiments to test the sensitivity of caudal arteries to drugs, 2) the perfused mesenteric vascular bed is a useful preparation for studying sensitivity of blood vessels in hypertension, 3) the supersensitivity of blood vessels in the DOCA-salt model may be of greater importance relative to circulating catecholamines than to sympathetic innervation, and 4) the supersensitivity of blood vessels to norepinephrine in the DOCA-salt model is not due to changes in neuronal uptake, extraneuronal uptake, or membrane potential of the vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the increased thickness seen in media of mesenteric resistance vessels of Wistar-Kyoto rats made hypertensive by a Goldblatt procedure (one-kidney, one clip model) was due to hypertrophy or hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells, the cellular dimensions of these vessels were estimated using a new, unbiased stereological method (the disector). Furthermore, to investigate whether the changes seen could be secondary to the increased blood pressure, morphometric measurements were also made in renal arcuate arteries, which, due to the constricting silver clip, probably had not been exposed to the increased pressure load. Vessels were mounted on a myograph, and their media thickness, lumen diameter, and maximum active wall tension response were measured. In the mesenteric vessels media thickness had increased by 58%, whereas no changes were seen in the renal vessels. Vessels were then fixed, and serial sections were made in the mesenteric vessels. The disector was used to calculate the numerical cell density in each vessel. By combining the myograph measurements and the estimated numerical cell density, the number of cells per segment unit length was calculated (renal hypertensive rats, 6.8 micron-1; sham-operated Wistar-Kyoto rats, 6.3 micron-1; p greater than 0.40) and mean cell volume was determined (renal hypertensive rats, 1541 micron 3; sham-operated Wistar-Kyoto rats, 1256 micron 3; p less than 0.02). No morphometrical changes were found in single sections of the renal arteries. We conclude that the increased media thickness observed in mesenteric resistance vessels of one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats mainly was caused by smooth muscle cell hypertrophy.\r"

Autoregulation of cortical and papillary blood flow was studied using a laser-Doppler flowmeter in volume-expanded and hydropenic rats. Superficial cortical flow and whole kidney renal blood flow were autoregulated in volume-expanded rats and decreased by less than 10% after renal perfusion pressure was lowered from 150 to 100 mm Hg. In contrast, papillary blood flow was not autoregulated and fell by 24 +/- 2%. The failure of papillary blood flow to autoregulate was due to changes in the number of perfused vessels as well as to alterations in blood flow in individual ascending and descending vasa recta. Pressure in vasa recta capillaries increased from 6.8 +/- 0.8 to 13.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg after renal perfusion pressure was elevated from 100 to 150 mm Hg, and renal interstitial pressure rose from 7.4 +/- 0.8 to 12.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg. In hydropenic rats, papillary blood flow was autoregulated to a significant extent, but it still decreased by 19% after renal perfusion pressure was lowered from 150 to 100 mm Hg. The pressure-diuretic and pressure-natriuretic responses in hydropenic rats were blunted in comparison to those observed in volume-expanded rats. These findings indicate that the pressure-diuretic and pressure-natriuretic responses are associated with changes in vasa recta hemodynamics and renal interstitial pressure.\r"

Neural influences on the kidney were eliminated by renal denervation, and plasma levels of vasopressin, aldosterone, corticosterone, and norepinephrine were maintained at fixed levels by i.v. infusion. Fractional excretion of sodium, chloride, and water increased markedly after renal perfusion pressure was elevated from 110 to 150 mm Hg. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and single nephron glomerular filtration rate measured from deep and superficial nephrons were unsaltered. Reabsorption of chloride and water in the proximal tubule of superficial nephrons decreased by 10% after renal perfusion pressure was elevated and contributed to the pressure-diuretic response. Changes in renal perfusion pressure also altered the reabsorption of water and chloride in juxtamedullary nephrons. The percentage of the filtered water load reaching the tip of the loop of Henle increased from 19.8 +/- 2.9 to 38.1 +/- 3.0% after renal perfusion pressure was elevated. Chloride delivery rose from 34.2 +/- 4.3 to 65.2 +/- 4.8% of the filtered load. These results support the view that alterations in medullary hemodynamics participate in the pressure-natriuretic response by inhibiting tubular reabsorption in the proximal tubule or the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle (or both) of juxtamedullary nephrons.\r"

The spinotrapezius muscles of 16- to 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were contracted at frequencies of 1, 2, 4, and 8 Hz. The inner diameters of first-order through third-order arterioles were measured at rest and following 3 minutes of contractions. Tissue oxygen tension (PO2) at the venous end of capillaries was monitored during 8-Hz contractions. At rest, following contractions, and after maximum dilation with adenosine, the inner diameters of arterioles of equivalent branch order were not significantly different in SHR and WKY. Opening of closed arterioles during muscle contraction and adenosine application occurred in less than 5% of the observations in both groups. The resting tissue PO2 was 25.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg in normal rats and 26.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in SHR. At nearly maximum vasodilation during 8-Hz stimulation, tissue PO2 recovered to 81.9 +/- 12.7% of control in WKY but only to 41.2 +/- 13.0% of control in SHR. These observations indicate that the expression of local regulatory mechanisms related to tissue metabolism is virtually normal in the spinotrapezius muscle vasculature of SHR in the context of arteriolar dilation. However, at near maximum performance, factors other than absolute arteriolar diameter preclude the normal preservation of tissue PO2 in the spinotrapezius muscle of SHR.\r"

RBC water content correlated positively and significantly (r = 0.53, p = 0.001) with minimum forearm vascular resistance, a measure of vascular structural change, and negatively with maximal forearm blood flow (r = -0.55, p less than 0.001). Similar correlations with forearm vascular resistance and blood flow were observed under all experimental conditions. RBC Na+-K+ cotransport correlated positively and significantly (r = 0.43, p = 0.01) with the change in forearm blood flow produced by phentolamine, a functional measure of alpha-adrenergic tone, and was as strong an independent predictor of phentolamine-induced blood flow change as was arterial norepinephrine concentration. RBC Na+-K+ cotransport was also significantly positively correlated with residual forearm blood flow and resistance after phentolamine administration, where nonadrenergic influences predominate. RBC water correlated negatively with Li+-Na+ countertransport (r = -0.33, p less than 0.05) and Na+-K+ cotransport (r = -0.44, p less than 0.01). We propose that RBC water is a marker for a vascular structural property that contributes to vascular reactivity. RBC Na+-K+ cotransport seems to relate most strongly to the sympathetically mediated control of forearm blood flow and may also be linked to the intrinsic myogenic tone of the forearm vasculature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To define the predictors of subsequent childhood blood pressure and left ventricular mass, serial echocardiograms and blood pressure responses during exercise were studied in 274 children aged 6 to 15 years, whose systolic blood pressures were in the high, middle, or low range. Persistence of rank order for left ventricular mass and blood pressure, at rest and during exercise, was maintained over a mean follow-up period of 3.4 years, with correlations ranging from 0.33 to 0.44. Subsequent systolic blood pressure was best predicted from initial resting and maximal exercise systolic blood pressures and left ventricular mass. Subsequent left ventricular mass was best predicted from initial left ventricular mass and maximal exercise diastolic blood pressure, but resting systolic blood pressure did not add to this latter prediction. Since left ventricular mass relates best to exercise blood pressure and not to resting blood pressure, left ventricular mass may provide an integrated view of the effects of blood pressure both at rest and during stress. We speculate that increased left ventricular mass in childhood may be an important predictor of subsequent hypertension and its consequences.\r"

In normotensive subjects, several hundred +PI/+SBP and -PI/-SBP sequences of 3 beats were found whereas the number of sequences of 4, 5, and more than 5 beats showed a progressive drastic reduction. The mean slopes of +PI/+SBP (7.6 +/- 2.0 msec/mm Hg) and -PI/-SBP (6.4 +/- 1.5 msec/mm Hg) sequences were similar, but in both instances there was a large scattering of the values around the mean (variation coefficients: 64.2 +/- 4.7 and 62.6 +/- 2.4%). The slopes decreased as a function of the sequence length and baseline heart rate and increased to a marked extent during the night as compared with daytime values. All sequences were more rare (-33.2% for +PI/+SBP and -31.7% for -PI/-SBP) and less steep in hypertensive subjects (-40.3 and -36.2%, respectively), who failed to show the marked nighttime increase in slope observed in normotensive subjects. To our knowledge, these observations provide the first description in humans of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex in daily life. This reflex is characterized by marked within-subject variations in sensitivity due in part to hemodynamic, temporal, and behavioral factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "High (8%) and low (0.3%) NaCl diets were administered for 3 weeks before testing inbred Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) or salt-resistant rats (SR/Jr) for altered susceptibility to cerebral infarction after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. At occlusion time, mean systolic blood pressure (BP) was 201 +/- 7 mm Hg in SS/Jr fed a high NaCl diet. Two weeks later an atrophied infarct was present in the territory of the occluded artery of all (n = 10) hypertensive SS/Jr, and infarct size was correlated with BP at occlusion time (p less than 0.01). In normotensive control SS/Jr fed a low NaCl diet (n = 11), BP (118 +/- 3 mm Hg), frequency of infarction (18%), and infarct size were all significantly less (p less than 0.05) than in the hypertensive rats. In SR/Jr fed a high (n = 11) or low (n = 10) NaCl diet, BP was not statistically different (112 +/- 4 vs 116 +/- 4 mm Hg). Cerebral infarction frequency was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater in SR/Jr fed a high NaCl diet (73%) than in SR/Jr receiving a low NaCl diet (20%), but infarct size was not correlated with BP in SR/Jr (p greater than 0.05). Thus, elevated NaCl intake in SS/Jr and SR/Jr before middle cerebral artery occlusion predisposes to cerebral infarction, but differences in infarct size and its correlation with BP suggest the controlling factors are not identical in the two strains.\r"

The main aim is the prevention of hypotensive episodes during treatment. An experimental protocol has been developed for parameter estimation of each patient during a single dialysis. Clinical tests illustrated the model's ability to fit the patient's state during dialysis. This is the first step in the more general task of validation of the model, necessary for the achievement of a closed-loop dialysis unit.\r"

Heparin-free hemodialyses (n = 208) were performed in 46 unselected patients with high bleeding risk after kidney transplantation (n = 25), after major surgery (n = 10), and with bleeding disorders (n = 11). Dialyser and blood lines were primed without heparin. In addition to the established measures (high blood flow, intermittent rinsing), system clotting was prevented by prophylactically changing the dialyser and blood lines in 107 of 208 dialyses (52 percent). Total system clotting with blood loss ranging from 100 to 250 ml occurred in six cases (3 percent). Mean hemodialysis time (+/- SD) was 4.1 hours (+/- 0.4), rising volume of the extracorporeal system 1.4 liters/hour (+/- 0.6), blood flow 244 ml/min (+/- 38), clotting time 12 min (+/- 4), and weight loss 2.5 kg (+/- 1.5). Mean hemodialysis creatinine clearance was 110 ml/min (+/- 34) and BUN clearance 138 ml/min (+/- 48). Heparin-free hemodialysis with prophylactic change of system is thus a safe and practical method of treatment for patients at high bleeding risk, but it is less effective, more expensive and the patient requires closer care.\r"

Patients were treated during 8 different periods, randomly ordered in each case, resulting from the combination of the following: the membrane, either Cuprophan or Polyacrylonitrile; the dialysate temperature, 37 or 35 degrees C, and the sodium concentration, 133 or 139 mmol/l. The incidence of symptomatic hypotension was lower at 35 degrees C in the entire study with either membrane and either sodium concentration. It was also lower with a sodium concentration of 139 mmol/l with either temperature and either membrane. There was a lower incidence of symptomatic hypotension when using Polyacrylonitrile, but this difference was not significant. We conclude that changes in physicochemical parameters of dialysate lead to worth-while improvement of symptomatic hypotension in hemodialysis patients, but membrane biocompatibility seems to play a minor role.\r"

  ".W": "No synthetic prosthesis has yet been found which can satisfactorily be used as a substitute for saphenous veins in vascular surgery. One explanation for the lack of success is that their properties and behaviour do not mimic those of the arteries they replace. The essential features for a successful vascular prosthesis, over and above biocompatibility, are a low friction non-thrombogenic flow surface, mechanical (elastic) behaviour that matches natural artery and dimensions that approximate the host vessels. This will allow a high velocity of flow with low impedance. A prosthesis with this specification would avoid the problems of flow disturbances and reflection at the anastomoses, pulse wave damping and large pressure gradients, all of which reduce pulsatile energy. We have designed a vascular prosthesis based upon the above criteria. It has an internal diameter of 4 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. Its geometry makes it kink resistant and a good match for tibial and coronary arteries. The prosthesis is made from polyurethane and its mechanical properties, which approximate to those of peripheral arteries, are achieved via a mechanism of internal wall compression rather than external circumferential expansion. To assess the in-vivo potential of this prosthesis, 21 grafts were implanted in 11 sheep, replacing a section of carotid artery with a 6 cm long prosthesis. All 21 grafts were patent after 3 months. One graft was removed for histological examination. 16 of the remaining 20 grafts were patent after 7 months. Problems associated with thrombosis were not encountered and we conclude that this prosthesis shows good potential as a small bore vascular substitute.\r"

The velocities were measured during 5-15 heart cycles at 41 predetermined measurement points almost evenly distributed in the cross sectional area. Velocity profiles were visualized three-dimensionally at 100 time intervals during one mean heart cycle. The standard deviation of velocities was correspondingly three-dimensionally visualized. For the patients with normal aortic valves the velocity profiles were generally flat but skew, with the highest velocity closer to the left vessel wall at the start of systole. During systole the skewness turned counter-clockwise with the highest velocities closer to the posterior, right and finally anterior vessel wall at the end of systole. In patients with an artificial heart valve in the aortic position the design of the valve was reflected on the contour of the profiles. The findings correspond well with model studies.\r"

Measurements were made in 8 patients with normal aortic valves, in 4 after insertion of a St. Jude Medical (SJM) aortic valve and in 3 after insertion of a Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball (SSB) aortic valve. Data analysis based on Fast Fourier Transform demonstrated that turbulence energy was lower in patients with normal aortic valves than in patients after insertion of an artificial valve in the aortic position and probably more pronounced after SSB valves than after SJM valves. The spatial distribution of the turbulence energy above 100 Hz was more irregular than corresponding laminar velocities previously presented. The VER100 (Velocity Energy Ratio at 100 Hz, i.e. the velocity energy above 100 Hz divided by the total velocity energy) proved useful for evaluating differences in flow disturbances downstream of different aortic valves. The mean VER100 in the three categories of patients were respectively 0.3, 1.4, and 2.1%.\r"

The 5-year free-from-thromboembolism (TE) survival was 95% for AVR and 92% for MVR. The hazard function (the instantaneous risk) for TE peaked in the first six months after operation for AVR and MVR. Another analysis using the Cox regression model to estimate risk factors of systemic emboli and thrombotic obstruction pinpointed two factors in the AVR group: presence of aortic regurgitation (AR) and age at operation. In the MVR group the sole predictor covariate was sex of the patients, with a higher hazard for females. Our results underline the importance of patient-related factors besides the type of prosthesis as predictors of morbidity from TE.\r"

Plasma lipoprotein levels and the postheparin activities of hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase were measured in 28 women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were treated with prednisone, 10 women with SLE not treated with prednisone, and 15 normal women.

Forty-three percent of the prednisone-treated group had apoB levels of 1.20 g/L or more compared to 7% of normal subjects and none of the untreated SLE group (P less than 0.05). However, of the 12 prednisone-treated patients with elevated plasma apoB levels 5 had normal plasma lipid levels. There were no differences in the postheparin lipase activities among the 3 groups.

The RIA was based on an antiserum raised to bovine 31K inhibin using [125I]31K inhibin as tracer. Bovine inhibin alpha- and beta-subunits, bovine activin-A, transforming growth factor-beta, and Mullerian inhibitory substance did not cross-react in the RIA. In both assays, dilutions of serum gave response lines parallel to that of the partially purified human follicular fluid inhibin preparation used as standard. Negligible levels of both bio (B)- and immuno (I) activities were found in serum from women with premature ovarian failure or castrated men. In ovulation-induced cycles, serum B inhibin levels increased progressively from the early to the late follicular phase and remained at the late follicular phase level during the early and midluteal phases. Serum I inhibin levels also rose during the follicular phase, but declined during the early luteal phase before increasing again in the midluteal phase. As a consequence, inhibin B:I ratios varied during the treatment cycle, with high ratios in early follicular (2.86) and early luteal (2.25) phases and a low ratio in the midluteal phase (1.09). Similar changes in serum B:I ratios also occurred during the midcycle and midluteal phases of normal cycles. The B:I ratio was lower (0.35) in normal men. We conclude that the largely similar pattern of inhibin biological and immunological activities in serum obtained during a variety of physiological conditions support the validity of the RIA procedure, and the B:I ratio of serum inhibin varies during the follicular and luteal phases of the cycle and is low in men. Potential reasons for these changes in B:I ratio include the presence of interfering substances in either the bioassay or the RIA, the presence of inhibin isoforms, and/or modulation of secreted forms by sex steroids.\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive and specific RIA has been developed to measure thyronine (To) in urine. The RIA used an anti-To antibody obtained from a rabbit immunized with a L-To-human serum albumin conjugate and [3H]To as the radioligand. The acetic acid analog of To (ToAc), that is the diphenyl structure with an acetic acid side-chain, cross-reacted strongly with the antibody. Relative to To, it cross-reacted 160% in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 100% in 0.075 mol/L barbital buffer, pH 8.6, containing sodium salicylate (final concentration, 8 mg/mL). The latter conditions were employed for the RIA, and the results reported thus reflect the presence of To and/or ToAc. 3-Monoiodothyronine, 3'-monoiodothyronine, 3',5'-diiodothyronine, and 3,5-diiodothyronine cross-reacted with the anti-To antibody 1.9%, 1.7%, 0.3%, and 0.2%, respectively; the cross-reactivity of other To derivatives and tyrosine and its derivatives was less than 0.05%. Urinary To and/or ToAc excretion in 12 normal subjects averaged 16 +/- 2 (+/- SE) micrograms/day (59 +/- 9 nmol/day) or 14 +/- 2 micrograms/g creatinine (5.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/mmol creatinine). Treatment of urine from normal subjects with beta-glucuronidase or sulfatase did not significantly alter the To content. Column and thin layer chromatographic studies revealed that 83% and 61%, respectively (range, 37-100%), of urinary To immunoreactivity was attributable to ToAc. The mean daily excretion of To in 20 patients with nonthyroidal illness [NTI; 22 +/- 4 micrograms/day (82 +/- 17 nmol/day)] was similar to that in normal subjects, but was elevated when expressed as nanomoles per mmol creatinine (20 +/- 2; P less than 0.001), because creatinine excretion was reduced in the NTI patients. The mean daily urinary To excretion in 13 patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease was slightly elevated [29 +/- 6 micrograms/day (108 +/- 21 nmol/day); P less than 0.1], but was clearly elevated when expressed as nanomoles per mmol creatinine (37 +/- 8; P less than 0.001), again because creatinine excretion was reduced in these patients. The mean urinary To excretion was subnormal in 13 patients with hypothyroidism and was significantly (P less than 0.005) less than that in the NTI patients regardless of the manner in which the results were expressed. Analysis of pronase hydrolysates of thyroid glands obtained at autopsy from euthyroid patients suggested that the To content of the thyroid approximates only 1.2% that of T4, supporting the thesis that prior iodination of tyrosine is critical for the coupling process in the thyroid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-five patients with MyD, 13 patients with other neuromuscular disorders (non-MyD), and 12 normal subjects were studied. The mean plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level in the MyD patients [83.2 +/- 23.1 (+/- SD) pmol/L] was significantly higher than those in the other two groups [normal subjects, 49.7 +/- 15.4 (P less than 0.01); non-MyD patients, 51.6 +/- 27.4 (P less than 0.01)]. On the contrary, the mean plasma 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were similar in the MyD patients and the normal subjects. The increments in serum calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion after oral calcium loading in the MyD patients were significantly greater than those in the normal subjects, suggesting that intestinal calcium absorption was augmented in the MyD patients. The mean nephrogenous cAMP excretion in the MyD patients (1.71 +/- 1.08 nmol/100 mL glomerular filtrate) also was higher than those in the other two groups (0.93 +/- 0.34 in the non-MyD patients; 0.91 +/- 0.21 in normal subjects). These results suggest that parathyroid function may be increased in MyD patients.\r"

Of the children, 88 were prepubertal (3-16 yr old) and 39 were pubertal (10-16 yr old). The height of each child was expressed as the SD score, i.e. height in relation to the sex- and age-matched Swedish reference groups, and spontaneous GH secretion was estimated by taking integrated 20-min blood samples for a 24-h period, i.e. 72 samples/child. In a few children, discrete samples were taken in parallel with the integrated 20-min samples with virtually the same results. Plasma GH was estimated in each sample using a polyclonal RIA method. To compare different 24-h GH profiles, the profiles were analyzed using a computer program (Pulsar). One objective of the study was to determine if less frequent sampling and/or shorter sampling periods yielded the same information as that obtained by 20-min sampling for the whole 24-h period. To determine if less frequent sampling provided the same information as that obtained by the 20-min period, we simulated 40- and 60-min periods by pooling two or three consecutive samples. No difference was found between 20- and 40-min sampling, but with 60-min sampling the mean calculated baseline plasma GH concentrations increased, and the GH concentration within peaks [the area under the curve above the baseline (AUCb)] decreased markedly. A 30-min sampling interval thus seems to be a valid practical compromise. To determine if sampling periods shorter than 24 h provided the same information, we divided the profiles, which started at 0900 h, into two 12-h, three 8-h and four 6-h periods. A graded decrease in AUCb and a corresponding increase in the baseline was found with the shorter periods, indicating that the whole 24-h period is necessary for GH sampling. Another objective of the study was to determine whether there was a correlation between 24-h GH secretion and the height, age, and sex of the children. In the prepubertal children, the height (in SD scores) was highly correlated (r = 0.69; P less than 0.001) with GH AUCb during the 24-h period. Height also correlated with AUCb estimated over shorter time periods; the correlation diminished with decreasing time. In the pubertal children, a nonlinear correlation (r = 0.36; P less than 0.05) was found between height and 24-h GH (AUCb).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From a cohort of 988 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma receiving primary surgical treatment between 1946 and 1970, we studied the 85 (9%) patients who had distant metastases diagnosed during life. Clinically detected metastases were found in 7% of the 859 patients with papillary cancers, 19% of the 100 patients with follicular cancers, and 34% of the 29 patients with Hurthle cell cancers. The total experience amounted to 607 patient-years of observation after the diagnosis of metastases, with a median follow-up in the 12 survivors of 23 yr (range, 13-32 yr). At the time of first diagnosis of metastases, the lungs only were involved in 53%, and bones only in 20%; 16% had multiple organ involvement. The overall mortality rates 5 and 10 yr after the diagnosis of metastases were 65% and 75%, respectively. Seventy-eight percent of all deaths were directly attributable to thyroid cancer; 82% of cancer deaths occurred within 5 yr. By univariate analysis, patient age, tumor extent, pattern of lung involvement, radioiodine uptake of the metastases, and radioiodine treatment were significant prognostic factors. By multivariate analysis, only age (as a continuous variable) at the time of first diagnosis of distant metastases (P less than 0.0001) and involvement of multiple organ sites (P = 0.0003) were independently associated with cancer mortality. The survival at 5 yr in 12 patients aged less than 40 yr with only a single organ involved was 92%. Older patients (aged greater than or equal to 40 yr) with a single metastasis (n = 59) had a lower survival (38% at 5 yr). The highest risk of cancer death (92% at 5 yr) was found in the 14 patients (any age) who at the time of first diagnosis of metastases had multiple organ involvement. The Cox regression model suggested that radioiodine therapy did not have a significant influence on survival, after adjusting for age and extent of metastatic involvement.\r"

The IGF concentrations in lymph were 10-30% of the corresponding serum levels, and in each subject the ratios of IGF-I and IGF-II in the lymph to those in the serum were similar. Western blot analysis of the BPs revealed that the five molecular forms identified in serum also were present in lymph, but in significantly smaller quantities. The 41.5K and 38.5K forms, which constitute the binding units of the large complex (approximately 150K) of serum and are also capable of binding IGFs in monomeric form, were present in smaller amounts than the 34K, 30K and 24K forms, which belong specifically to the small complex (approximately 40K) of serum. The BPs extracted from lymph were similar to those of the small complex, with a preferential affinity for IGF-II and only half of the affinity for IGF-I of the BPs extracted from serum. With neutral pH gel filtration of lymph, more than 90% of IGFs and binding activity eluted with the material in the area of the 40K zone. These data indicate that the 150K IGF-BP complexes do not cross the capillary barrier, whereas the 40K complexes do. The function of the former may be to provide a reservoir and buffering action of the IGFs, whereas the latter may be involved in the transport of the IGFs to their target cells.\r"

  ".U": "88315248\r", 
  ".W": "An important consequence of Turner's syndrome is short stature. We previously reported that the optimal doses of ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and GH for the stimulation of short term growth in such patients were 100 ng/kg.day and 0.15 U/kg (administered sc three times weekly), respectively. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of low dose estrogen and GH would stimulate short term growth more than either agent administered alone. Thirty-nine girls with Turner's syndrome (aged 5-15 yr) underwent one to three 6-month cycles, each consisting of a 2-month baseline period, a 2-month treatment period, and a subsequent 2-month washout period. During the first 2 yr of the study, the girls were assigned to receive the three treatments in random order. The treatments were EE2 (100 ng/kg.day, orally), GH (0.15 U/kg, sc, three times weekly), or the combination of EE2 and GH. Subsequently, some of the girls were treated with reduced doses of EE2 (50 ng/kg.day) and GH [0.09 U/kg, three times weekly (tid)] according to the same protocol. Lower leg length was measured every 2 months throughout the study. EE2 increased lower leg growth rate significantly at the dose of 100 ng/kg.day, but not at the dose of 50 ng/kg.day. Similarly, the higher dose of GH (0.15 U/kg, tiw) increased lower leg growth rate significantly, whereas the lower dose (0.09 U/kg, tiw) did not. However, combined treatment with the lower doses of EE2 (50 ng/kg.day) and GH (0.09 U/kg, tiw) stimulated lower leg growth rate significantly and to a similar degree as the higher dose of GH (0.15 U/kg, tiw). This higher dose of GH appeared to cause a maximal increase in lower leg growth rate, which was not further increased by combined administration with the higher dose (100 ng/kg.day) of estrogen. Thus, addition of low dose EE2 to an optimal dose of GH did not cause any apparent increase in short term lower leg growth rate in girls with Turner's syndrome. Whether the long term outcome of GH treatment would be altered by concurrent administration of low dose estrogen will require long term clinical trials.\r"

Immunoreactive PRL variants were immunoprecipitated from 100-microL aliquots of serum, and the precipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper, immunoblotted with anti-PRL serum and [125I]protein-A, and autoradiographed. The relative concentrations of the two forms of PRL were indicated by the intensity of the electrophoretic bands. Before pregnancy, serum G-PRL was the predominant PRL form. As pregnancy progressed, increasing amounts of PRL, compared to G-PRL, appeared in the serum, and it reached a maximum by the third trimester. G-PRL was found at all stages of pregnancy, even when the amount of PRL was greatest. After parturition in nonnursing mothers the PRL band again decreased; however, in nursing mothers the PRL band remained prominent. We conclude that the G-PRL and PRL variants may fulfill different physiological roles and, under certain conditions, such as pregnancy and lactation, more of the nonglycosylated PRL may be produced to fill special requirements.\r"

Five of them had received im or in sCT therapy for 1-4 yr up to 0.5-5 yr before this study. Low titer antibodies to sCT were detected in the serum of three of these five patients, but not in the four patients who had not received prior sCT therapy. After 2 months of in sCT administration, four of the former group, but none of the latter group, had antibodies to sCT. After 12 months of treatment, antibodies to sCT were found in all patients who had received sCT earlier and in three of the four patients who had not. The half-maximal inhibition of [125I]sCT binding ranged from 44-284 pmol/L sCT. In a cultured human breast cancer cell line (T47D) cAMP production was stimulated by sCT (EC50, 70 pmol/L). cAMP production stimulated by sCT (5 pmol/L) was reduced to 6-20% of the control value in the presence of serum from patients which inhibited [125I]sCT binding by more than 50% in a dilution of 1:50 or greater. In patients with lower titer antibodies cAMP production was not inhibited. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was transiently lowered to 79 +/- 6% (+/- SE) of basal levels in the patients who had earlier received sCT (P greater than 0.1), while sustained reduction to between 66 +/- 2% and 84 +/- 6% of basal levels (P less than 0.05) occurred in the patients who had not been treated with sCT previously. In conclusion, reexposure to sCT of five patients with Paget's disease caused secondary antibody responses and clinical resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine (DA) inhibits pituitary TSH release, but its role as a regulator of circadian and pulsatile TSH secretion is not clear. Accordingly, we studied the 24-h TSH secretory patterns in seven normal women in the early follicular phase of their cycles before and during DA receptor blockade by metoclopramide (MCP). Serum TSH was measured by a highly sensitive (0.05 mU/L) RIA at 15-min intervals for 48 h during sequential 24-h saline and 24-h MCP infusions (30 micrograms/kg.h). Sleep was confirmed by electroencephalogram between 2300-0700 h. All women had a nocturnal rise of TSH, independent of sleep, which began in the late afternoon and reached a peak (acrophase) after midnight during the saline infusion. This circadian periodicity was composed of a series of TSH pulses with greater magnitude and frequency during nocturnal hours. Infusion of MCP had no effect on pulse frequency, but the pulse amplitude increased (P less than 0.05), especially at night. As a consequence, the circadian excursion of TSH, as assessed by cosinor function, was exaggerated. The mean acrophase amplitude and mesor levels increased (P less than 0.05), but the nadir and acrophase times did not change. These findings suggest that DA is an inhibitor of TSH pulse amplitude throughout the 24-h biological clock. By inference, the neuroendocrine mechanism(s) that underlies the nocturnal increase in TSH secretion is not due to decreased dopaminergic inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "A hitherto unrecognized thyroid antibody, which reacts with a thyroid cell surface antigen expressed on passaged thyroid cells, was identified in serum from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy using antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) tests. The antibody was detected in 14 of 23 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism (Gh) and associated ophthalmopathy, in 3 of 4 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and ophthalmopathy, but in only 1 of 16 patients with Gh without clinically evident eye disease and 4 of 37 patients with HT without eye disease. The ADCC test also was positive in 2 of 30 patients with thyroid cancer, both of whom had had Gh and ophthalmopathy in the past. There was no correlation, in patients with ophthalmopathy, between the levels of the antibody (expressed as percent specific lysis) and the titers of antithyroid microsomal antibody measured using a hemagglutination assay. Based on the results of blocking experiments using mouse monoclonal antibodies against human thyroid peroxidase, now known to be the thyroid microsomal antigen, the corresponding antigen was not thyroid peroxidase. Moreover, the new antigen was expressed on cultured and passaged thyroid cells which do not express the microsomal antigen. In patients with ophthalmopathy there was a close correlation between the degree of lysis of passaged thyroid cells and that of eye muscle cells, and ADCC activity against passaged thyroid cells was absorbed by preincubation of positive serum samples with eye muscle and thyroid cell, but not other cell, monolayers. The reaction of a newly identified cytotoxic thyroid antibody with a shared epitope on eye muscle cells thus appears to be a possible mechanism for the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Gh and, less often, HT.\r"

Analysis of cDNA clones derived from prepro-GRP mRNAs predict the concurrent expression of a unique series of peptide hormones, the GRP gene-associated peptides (GGAPs). Alternative RNA splicing of the primary GRP gene transcript results in mRNAs that could encode 3 distinct forms of GGAPs. Using specific antisera directed against synthetic peptides representing portions of the predicted GGAPs, we found multiple GGAP forms in the endocrine cells of human fetal lung and in human small cell lung cancer cells (SCLC). Within a single pulmonary endocrine cell, at least 2 of these 3 predicted forms could be demonstrated using immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, concordant expression of GRP and GGAPs was found in 10 SCLC cell lines and 3 human SCLC tumors. These findings establish GGAPs as a novel peptide family in man and warrant further investigation into their potential role in normal and malignant growth.\r"

  ".U": "88315261\r", 
  ".W": "The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 has been used to treat the hypercortisolism of patients with nonpituitary Cushing's syndrome. Since endogenous cortisol production fluctuates in many patients with either the ectopic ACTH syndrome or adrenocortical tumors, treatment of these patients with a fixed dose of RU 486 introduces the risk of adrenal insufficiency. While RU 486 possesses some glucocorticoid agonist activity in addition to its potent antagonist effects, it is not known whether this intrinsic agonist activity is of sufficient magnitude to prevent adrenal insufficiency and sustain life. To answer this question three groups of bilaterally adrenalectomized cynomolgus monkeys (n = 5/group) were randomized to receive a daily injection of RU 486 (5 mg/kg.day), cortisol (1.25 mg/kg.day), or saline (placebo). All adrenalectomized monkeys received weekly im injections of deoxycorticosterone pivalate (1 mg) to prevent mineralocorticoid deficiency. Five sham-adrenalectomized monkeys served as controls and received im injections of saline (placebo). Blood was collected before adrenalectomy or sham operation and every 3 days postoperatively for measurement of serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine; plasma ACTH concentrations; and complete blood and differential cell counts. All sham-operated and cortisol-replaced adrenalectomized monkeys survived, and none developed overt biochemical evidence of adrenal insufficiency. All placebo and RU 486-replaced adrenalectomized monkeys expired within 33 days after adrenalectomy, presumably from adrenal insufficiency. These findings suggest that while RU 486 is a partial glucocorticoid agonist, its degree of glucocorticoid agonism is inadequate to prevent adrenal insufficiency and support life in adrenalectomized primates.\r"

No nuclear staining was seen when tissue sections were incubated with normal rat immunoglobulin G or when the monoclonal antibody was preincubated with a receptor-enriched chick intestinal cytosol preparation.

  ".W": "To validate the clinical usefulness of recently developed normetanephrine (NM) and metanephrine (M) RIA for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, urinary excretion of catecholamines and these metabolites were determined in 30 normal subjects, 40 patients with essential hypertension, 30 patients who were suspected to have but ultimately proven not to have a pheochromocytoma (pheochromocytoma-suspect), and 31 patients with a surgically verified pheochromocytoma. Abnormally high catecholamine excretion (epinephrine plus norepinephrine) was found in patients with pheochromocytoma compared with that in the normal subjects and the essential hypertension group. However, 3 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma had urinary catecholamine excretion that overlapped the values in the pheochromocytoma-suspect group. Both urinary NM and M excretion also were elevated in patients with pheochromocytoma, but in 4 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma urinary M excretion was within the range found in 1 or more of the other groups. Total M (NM plus M) excretion of more than 5485 nmol/day (as NM) was found in all patients with pheochromocytoma, and all patients had values that were higher than the highest values in the normal subjects or the patients with no evidence of pheochromocytoma. To save time and simplify the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma, we also determined the NM and M concentrations in randomly voided 1-h urine samples in 24 patients with pheochromocytomas, 31 patients with essential hypertension, and 16 normal subjects. Abnormally high total M excretion was found in all patients with pheochromocytomas, and there was no overlap with the values in the patients with essential hypertension or the normal subjects. We conclude that total M measurements in both 24-h and random 1-h urine samples are useful in diagnosing pheochromocytomas.\r"

By screening half the blood spots from each area, it was hoped to generate two comparable groups of fibrocystic children; those detected by screening and those not screened who would be diagnosed clinically. Over almost three years, more than 120,000 specimens were screened and 37 infants detected with cystic fibrosis. Four additional fibrocystic patients were missed on screening: two had negative immunoreactive trypsin values, of which one had meconium ileus, and two, although giving initial positive tests, were negative on follow up. Excluding infants known to be at risk, comparison of the numbers of children detected in the screened and unscreened groups showed more than a two-fold difference in favour of the screened group. There may be a large number of undiagnosed fibrocystic patients in the general population.\r"

Intimal area was measured using a digitiser and expressed as a proportion of the area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina (IEL), correcting for constriction (intima index). Arteries were subdivided into four size (length IEL) groups. For the smallest group (less than or equal to 600 micron length IEL) the mean intima index (II600) ranged from 0.09-0.34; half the values were greater than or equal to 0.20. Intimal abnormality was unrelated to the size or site of tumour or to macroscopic emphysema, and correlated weakly with pack years. II600 values were, however, significantly correlated with factors known to be affected by smoking such as alveolar wall surface area per unit lung volume, FEV1% predicted, and FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity); these last two factors were also significantly associated with intimal abnormality in arteries measuring 601-1200 micron length IEL.\r"

Plasma cells were the dominant cell type, and the admixture of other cells within the mass and the lack of a monotypic light chain/immunoglobulin phenotype on immunohistochemical analysis precluded a diagnosis of malignant disease. The potential for misinterpretation of this lesion as a neoplasm is considerable and its recognition may therefore be of great clinical importance.\r"

Excluding deaths in the perinatal period, the incidence appeared to be inversely related to age. Heterotopia was restricted to the subcricoid level of the oesophagus and often showed a close association with lymphoid tissue. There was no association with congenital malformation, and heterotopia occurred more commonly in those infants whose deaths were unexplained, although the reason for this association was unclear.\r"

The incidence of tuberculosis in vegetarians was 133 in 1000 and that in subjects on mixed diets 48 in 1000. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that dietary factors are of major importance in determining the susceptibility of Asiatic Indians to tuberculosis.\r"

All presented with peripheral cytopenias, mostly pancytopenia or bicytopenia dysplasia in one or more cell lineages, and a marrow biopsy specimen with less than normal numbers of nucleated cells for the age. Twenty four patients died, including 14 of the 16 who developed acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL).

Of these, 430 patients known to have lymphoproliferative disease at the time of biopsy were excluded. Of 356 patients, 86 (aggregate group) had at least one lymphoid aggregate in their biopsy specimen biopsy specimen (82 morphologically benign, three suspicious, and one malignant). Another 86 patients without aggregates (control group) were matched by age and sex. Both groups were followed up until death, or for a mean of 21.9 and 22.9 months, respectively, to assess their outcome. Eighteen (22%) of the 82 patients with morphologically benign lymphoid aggregates were later proved to have lymphoproliferative disease compared with none of the 86 control patients. Another 12 patients in the aggregate group and seven in the control group were suspected of having a lymphoproliferative disease on clinical grounds, so that altogether 30 (37%) and seven (8%), respectively, developed confirmed or suspected lymphoproliferative disease. In both cases the differences were highly significant (p less than 0.001). It is suggested that lymphoid aggregates in clinical biopsy material may not be a physiological finding and should alert pathologists or haematologists to the possibility of lymphoproliferative disease.\r"

The degree of proteolytic digestion of tissue specimens is critical to ensure adequate unmasking of DNA and to avoid non-specific staining, a consequence of endogenous biotin in liver. Specific in situ hybridisation was achieved after digestion with pepsin, proteinase K, or protease, which gave optimal results. Both hepatitis B virus DNA and cytomegalovirus DNA were visualised in tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection or in liver transplant recipients, respectively; the distribution of viral DNA was shown to be quite distinct between the two groups of patients.\r"

The difference between the positive mucosal areas in the antrum was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than in the fundic area. The positively stained area found along the lesser curvature was 7.76 (12.0)% while along the greater curvature, it was 2.17 (3.02)% (p less than 0.001). This method will be useful for future studies of the extent and topographical distribution of intestinal metaplasia among populations with disparate incidences of gastric carcinoma because it permits comparison of different areas of intestinal metaplasia in mucous gastric zones.\r"

These can be modified by dietary manipulation or dosage reduction. Although elevated serum triglyceride levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been linked to coronary artery disease, this has not been the case in patients receiving retinoids for acne. Greater caution must be exercised in patients receiving long-term dosing of retinoids. Teratogenic effects of retinoids include those affecting the central nervous system, heart, and craniofacial structures. Therefore female patients taking oral retinoids must not be pregnant, and precautions should be taken so that they do not become pregnant while under treatment. The time at which patients may become pregnant after retinoid treatment varies with the different retinoids.\r"

Wound bursting strength (WBS) was measured on days +7, +14, and +21. There was a significant decrease in WBS in experimental animals in groups 3 and 4 (perioperative and postoperative administration) compared to control animals, but no significant effect of preoperative dacarbazine on WBS in experimental animals (group 2).

All patients aged 70 years and over admitted to acute-care beds on the medical service wards during a 1-year period were included in the study (N = 396). Factors most predictive of 6-month mortality (using logistic regression) were decreased functional status, admitting diagnosis, and decreased mental status. Factors most predictive of nursing home admission were decreased functional status, living location, and decreased mental status. Functional status was a stronger predictor of length of stay, mortality, and nursing home placement than was principal admitting diagnosis--of relevance to the current emphasis on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). These data may be helpful in improving discharge planning, in resource allocation, and in targeting patients for different specialized geriatric programs.\r"

This study evaluated behavioral disturbances in 126 demented patients examined sequentially, using questionnaires administered to primary caregivers to quantify the types and severity of behavioral disturbances. Eighty-three percent of the patients exhibited one or more of the targeted behaviors. The most common troublesome and disruptive behaviors clustered into three categories: aggressive, ideational, and vegetative. The prevalence and severity of the behaviors increased with global severity of dementia, but did not differ in either frequency or type when patients with three diagnoses were compared: Alzheimer's disease (AD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and mixed AD and MID (MIX). The occurrence and severity of the target behaviors correlated modestly with the severity of dementia. Impairments of mental status correlated weakly with only a single troublesome and disruptive behavior--assaultiveness. These results suggest that troublesome and disruptive behaviors are a very frequent component of dementing disorders, are related to disease severity, and parallel (but are probably not determined by) intellectual deficit.\r"

However, physically active and inactive older men reacted similarly (with respect to all hemodynamic variables except the stroke volume index) in the sitting, standing and 70 degrees upright tilt positions as compared with the supine; the stroke volume index decreased significantly more compared with that of the supine in the physically active men.\r"

To determine whether social support also influences the recovery of function among patients who have had hip fractures and to describe other potential predictors of recovery after hip fracture, 111 patients with hip fractures were interviewed and examined before discharge from the hospital. The functional status of surviving patients was assessed again 6 months later. Patients who had a greater number of social supports had more complete recovery of their prefracture level of function (r = .21; P = .04). This association was strongest for patients over 60 years old (r = .31; P = .006); among these patients, this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for other significant (P less than .05) predictors of recovery: arm strength, mental status, and serum albumin. Additional studies should be done to test whether interventions to increase social supports can improve the recovery of function among elderly patients with hip fractures and other illnesses. In the meantime, health professionals should counsel elderly patients about the potential rehabilitative and preventive benefits of social supports.\r"

Using data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, those who developed pressure sores were identified through death certificates, hospital discharge summaries and self-report or proxy-report. During the follow-up period, pressure sores were identified in 113 of the 5,193 respondents (2.2%) for whom follow-up information was available. Incidence over the follow-up period was 1.7% for those aged 55 to 69 at baseline and rose to 3.3% for those 70 to 75 years old. Risk factors for pressure sore development were evaluated using data collected in NHANES I at baseline. Those with identified pressure sores were compared with the remainder of their cohort and also with a control group matched on age and length of longest hospitalization or nursing home admission. Significantly increased risk for pressure sore development was found for those who at baseline were current smokers, reported being relatively inactive, had poor self-assessed health status and who were found on physician's exam to have dry or scaling skin. Neurologic abnormality on the physician's exam and anemia at baseline were also associated with increased risk of pressure sores, although these associations were of borderline statistical significance.\r"

There were 116 (84%) who completed a comprehensive performance-based assessment. There were no significant differences between the three groups in age, formal cognitive testing, or prevalence of stroke history. However, there were significant differences in grip strength, reaction time, static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, and peripheral vision. Using stepwise ordinal logistic regression, dynamic visual acuity, nondominant hand grip strength, and total horizontal peripheral visual field were significantly associated with driving frequency (P less than .05), and together explained approximately 45% of the variance. Subtle motor and visual deficits that can be detected by a performance-based assessment may play an important role in determining driving frequency in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Pap smear screening in women 65 years of age and older is controversial. To assess the need to offer screening in this group, we examined Pap results of women 65 and older whose charts were reviewed as part of a cancer screening study in two San Francisco hospitals. Two hundred thirty women (41%) were 65 years of age or older (mean age, 73). Compared with younger women, they were less likely to have had a Pap smear during the past 3 years (61% versus 72%), less likely to have seen a gynecologist (24% versus 34%), and were more likely to have refused Pap screening (11% versus 5%). Of the 140 women who had Paps, five showed atypia (class II). None exhibited dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. Those with atypia were all nonwhite. One had had a hysterectomy; two had a history of previously abnormal Paps. Overall, women with a history of abnormal Paps were far more likely to be screened (91% versus 58%). Those who had had a hysterectomy were significantly less likely to be screened (51% versus 68%). These results showed a low rate of cervical dysplasia/carcinoma in older, low-income women. Although our sample was small, the low rate of abnormals may reflect the relatively high rate of prior screening in this population. Because older women are not likely to see gynecologists, primary care physicians should continue Pap screening in older women (including those with a history of hysterectomy) until a history of repeated, technically adequate, normal Pap smears is documented.\r"

We found that both the elderly and health care professionals talk about life-prolongation, but not with one another; that they consider some of the same factors as they think about the life-prolongation decision; and that most of them believe physicians should be responsible for initiating discussion. However, the physician or health care professional who wishes to avoid crisis situations also is reluctant to broach the issue for fear of unnecessarily alarming or compromising the defense mechanisms of the patient. The patient remains patient, waiting--with fears of dependency, memories of previous life-threatening experiences, and deep sensitivity for suffering--for the physician to initiate the discussion. Is a mediator such as a family member necessary in these situations? Is the hospital environment not conductive to discussion of less than heroic efforts?\r"

We and others have previously reported that cholera toxin possesses strong adjuvant effects on the gut immune response to co-administered Ag. To explore further adjuvant effects of cholera toxin, the holotoxin or its B subunit was chemically cross-linked to Sendai virus. The resulting conjugates, which were not infectious, were evaluated for their capacity to induce gut immune responses against Sendai virus after oral administration to mice. Conjugating cholera toxin to virus significantly enhanced the adjuvant activity of cholera toxin compared to simple mixing. Cholera toxin B subunit, however, did not show an adjuvant effect either by itself or conjugated with the virus. Oral administration of the Sendai virus-cholera toxin conjugate was also able to prime for protective anti-viral responses in the respiratory tract. Mice that were orally immunized with the conjugate and intra-nasally boosted with inactivated virus alone showed virus-specific IgA titers in nasal secretions that correlated with protection against direct nasal challenge with live Sendai virus. For comparison, s.c. immunization was also studied. Systemic immunization with the virus-cholera toxin conjugate induced virus-specific antibody responses in serum as well as in the respiratory tract but failed to protect the upper respiratory tract against virus challenge. Systemic immunization plus an intra-nasal boost did, however, confer a variable degree of protection to the upper respiratory tract, which correlated primarily with bronchoalveolar lavage (lung) antibody titers.\r"

To further characterize this site, mAb against IFN-alpha 2b were selected that block the binding of radiolabeled IFN-alpha 2b to its cell surface receptor. These antibodies also neutralized the anti-viral and anti-proliferative properties of IFN-alpha 2b. A subset of these antibodies (group 1) do not recognize IFN-alpha 2a, either in solid-phase immunoassays or functional assays, whereas a second subset (group 2), with no cross-reactivity with group 1, recognizes both IFN-alpha subtypes. Because IFN-alpha 2b and IFN-alpha 2a differ by only alpha Arg23-Lys23 substitution, group 1 antibodies must recognize an epitope within the receptor binding region of IFN-alpha 2b that includes Arg23. Group 2 antibodies recognize a separate and distinct epitope within the binding site that does not include Arg23.\r"

  ".U": "88315765\r", 
  ".W": "Hydrolysis of the internal thioester bond in native C3 is thought to be a key event in initiating the alternative pathway of C activation, because the resulting C3(H2O) acquires \"C3b-like\" properties. Therefore, disruption of the internal thioester bond is probably accompanied by conformational changes in the C3 molecule. In this study, we demonstrate that such conformational changes indeed occur; 7 of the 19 mAb raised against C3 or C3 activation products recognized epitopes exposed on C3(H2O) but not on native C3. One of these epitopes is located on the C3a part, three on the C3c part, and another three on the C3d,g part. Because the 7 mAb bound equally well to C3 incubated either with MgCl2 or with methylamine (which primarily disrupts the thioester), the conformational changes detected by the mAb apparently occur after disruption of the thioester. Furthermore, the epitopes were also present on the corresponding C3 activation products. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that the epitopes for the three anti-C3d,g mAb were located on the C3d part, C-terminal to the thioester. The epitopes for 2 of the 3 anti-C3c mAb were located on the C-terminal alpha-chain fragment of C3c. Thus, this study provides immunochemical evidence for the biologic resemblance between C3(H2O) and C3 activation products. Implications of these findings for the activation process of C3 are discussed.\r"

However, only ingestion of EIgG is associated with activation of the respiratory burst and release of superoxide anion. We compared the endogenous phosphorylation of proteins from macrophages stimulated by interaction with EIgG or EIgMC on the premise that proteins phosphorylated after stimulation by EIgG but not EIgMC could play a role in activating the enzyme (oxidase) responsible for the respiratory burst. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional and two-dimensional electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. We found that proteins with approximate Mr of 20 kDa, 23 kDa, 46 kDa, 48 kDa (three proteins), 67 kDa, and 130 kDa were more heavily phosphorylated after EIgG stimulation than after EIgMC stimulation. Exposure to PMA, which activates the respiratory burst oxidase, induced phosphorylation of the 23-kDa, 48-kDa group, and 130-kDa proteins that were phosphorylated after stimulation by EIgG. Activity of protein kinase C was found to be significantly increased in the particulate fraction of macrophages stimulated by EIgG but not in the particulate fraction of EIgMC-stimulated cells. These data are compatible with the hypotheses that phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins, especially with a Mr of approximately 48 kDa, is involved in activation of the respiratory burst oxidase, and that function of protein kinase C also plays a part in this activation process.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the mechanisms that account for short Ig H chain production in two variants of the mouse myeloma cell line MPC11 (IgG2b, kappa) by mRNA sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping. One variant, F5.5, has a thymidine residue inserted into the (CH3) domain, of the Ig H chain, resulting in premature termination and translation of a gamma 2b H chain of 50,000 m.w. A second variant, E5.7A12, contains gamma 2a-derived sequences that extend from near the 3' end of the CH2 domain to the intervening sequence between the CH2 and CH3 domains, consistent with a microrecombination event (defined as either a double cross-over or gene conversion event). In this variant, the 5' end of the CH3 domain has been deleted, but the remainder of the gamma 2b(CH3) domain is present, resulting in the translation of a gamma 2b-gamma 2a-gamma 2b H chain of 52,000 m.w. Additional rearrangements affecting sequences in or adjacent to the variable region accompany H chain constant region alterations in these cell lines and subclones of these cell lines. In F5.5, novel sequences have recombined within one of two duplicated copies of the VH gene. In a sister clone of E5.7A12 that has ceased H chain production (E5.7A14), new sequences have recombined within 300 bp 5' of the enhancer element. Both F5.5 and E5.7A12, like their immediate unstable precursor cells, fail to assemble H-H dimers, halting the Ig assembly process at the heavy-light stage, and do not secrete H chains. We speculate that defects in H chain assembly and secretion, as exemplified by the parents of these variants (i.e., intermediates of these secondary variants), reactivate the Ig gene rearrangement machinery and result in the formation of these putatively equally unstable secondary variants.\r"

The overall incidence of non-cutaneous cancer was slightly but not significantly elevated in our population (Standard Mortality Ratio = 1.2, P greater than 0.05). In an analysis of individual sites, we observed significant increases in the incidence of colonic cancer and primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. We found no significant increase in the incidence of lymphoma, leukemia, or malignant melanoma within our cohort. Because of the possible long latency time and the low incidence of these malignancies only continued follow-up of this cohort can assure us that PUVA therapy does not substantially alter the risk for the development of these conditions.\r"

Mature mast cells never responded to any stimulus tested, and immature cells exhibited far less responsiveness than their precursors. Macrophages migrated towards LTB4, PAF, formylated peptide, activated and sensitized serum, spleen cell supernatants and less so towards fibronectin, growth factors (EGF, FGF) and growth factor containing media. In general, cells from sensitized animals and young elicited cells were more active than resting macrophages.

  ".W": "Human type V collagen was purified from post-burn granulation tissues, and was demonstrated to exist in two different molecular assemblies consisting of [alpha 1(V)]2 alpha 2(V) and alpha 1(V)alpha 2(V)alpha 3(V) heterotrimers which are designated as type V(112) and V(123) collagens, respectively, in this paper. The two molecular species were separated by salt fractionation at neutral pH under non-denaturing conditions. When crude type V collagen was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 degrees C, mainly collagen V(112) precipitated, leaving collagen V(123) in the solution. Type V(112) collagen, but not type V(123), precipitated at 0.15 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), whereas the type V(123) molecule precipitated at 4.5 M NaCl in the same buffer. When the crude type V collagen was electrophoresed under non-denaturing conditions, two bands were observed; and it was confirmed that the fast-migrating band was composed of [alpha 1(V)]2 alpha 2(V) and the slow-migrating band was alpha 1(V)alpha 2(V)alpha 3(V). Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of V(112) showed biochemical properties that were very similar, if not identical, to those of the corresponding alpha chains of V(123) judging from amino acid compositions, peptide mapping patterns obtained following treatment with cyanogen bromide and lysyl endopeptidase, and periodic acid Schiff and concanavalin A stainings. Alpha 3 chain, in contrast, was distinct from both alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains. The amino acid composition and peptide maps of alpha 3 chain were similar to some extent, but not identical, to those of the alpha 1 chain. The intensity of carbohydrate stainings of the alpha 3 chain was clearly different from that of the alpha 1 chain. The negatively stained segment-long-spacing crystallites of the two molecular species exhibited an identical banding pattern. The crystallite derived from collagen V(112) was usually in a dimeric form exhibiting the C-C terminal junction, but that of collagen V(123) was mostly in a monomeric form. Differences between the two molecular species is ascribed to the presence of the alpha 3 chain in collagen V(123).\r"

The results revealed that TK contained condensed nuclei in the initial stage, degraded nuclei in the advanced stage, and nuclear remnants in the late stage of their transformation into cornified cells. The condensed nuclei were essentially characterized by ultrastructural changes generally considered to reflect the cessation of RNA synthesis. The focal increase of density and the structural disintegration observed in the degraded nuclei of TK are apparently characteristic morphological features of degradation of nucleoproteins in these cells. Nuclear remnants contained altered nuclear envelope or similar structures and clumps of dense fibrillar material. Similar clumps of dense fibrils were present in the cytoplasm of both the TK with compact nuclear remnants and the TK with structural disintegration. This finding suggests that some dense fibrillar material of structurally disintegrating nuclei of TK is transported into the cytoplasm of these cells.\r"

An antibody against desmoplakins decorated true desmosomes in basophilic and transitional cells. Biochemically, trichocytic cytokeratin polypeptides as well as epithelial cytokeratins 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, and 19 were positively detected. These results provide evidence in support of the notion of a trichocytic differentiation and probably derivation of pilomatrixoma. According to the cytokeratin expression patterns the majority of pilomatrixoma cells resemble the normal hair cortex lineage but some enter a pathway of squamous cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Although little is known about changes in the lipid composition of the skin during fetal development, information regarding the developmental sequence of fetal skin lipid content could be important for understanding the emergence of epidermal barrier function, as well as providing baseline criteria for prenatal diagnosis of certain inherited disorders of cornification. In these studies, epidermis was separated from dermis in fetal skin samples ranging from 50 to 140 d, estimated gestational ages (EGA), and its lipid composition was analyzed by quartz rod microchromatography/flame-ionization and thin layer chromatography. Lipid biochemical data were correlated with developmental milestones observed by electron microscopy (morphologic studies). The lipid composition of epidermal and dermal fractions from skin samples between 50 and 110 d EGA was similar, with both tissues exhibiting a predominance of free sterols and phospholipids. After 110 d EGA dermis became enriched in triglycerides, corresponding to the progressive development of adipocytes after this time. EGA epidermis after 110 d was enriched not only in triglycerides, but also sterol esters. Moreover, ceramides and glycosphingolipids also became increasingly prominent, changes that were greatest in epidermis from older fetuses and from cephalad regions. These changes in epidermal lipid composition corresponded morphologically to the progressive emergence of both folliculocentric epidermal cornification and sebaceous gland development.\r"

  ".W": "Phenotypes of bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells are different from those of connective tissue-type mast cells (CTMCs) that are found in the peritoneal cavity and the skin. When cultured mast cells of WBB6F1 - +/+ mouse origin were directly injected into the skin of genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1 - W/Wv mice, mast cells appeared in both the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue (beneath the panniculus carnosus). In contrast to cultured mast cells, mast cells that were observed in either the dermis or the subcutaneous tissue were stained with berberine sulfate, suggesting the content of heparin. Cultured mast cells acquired the electron microscopic features of CTMC in either the dermis or the subcutaneous tissue of WBB6F1 - W/Wv mice, but the electron density of mast-cell granules was significantly higher in the dermis than in the subcutaneous tissue. Such an electron microscopic difference was also observed after the injection of purified peritoneal mast cells of WBB6F1 - +/+ mice into the skin of WBB6F1 - W/Wv mice. From the present study, we suggest that the electron density of mast-cell granules in the skin of WBB6F1 - W/Wv mice is not dependent on the type of injected mast cells but on the anatomical sites at which the injected cells are located.\r"

  ".W": "Because Langerhans and indeterminate cells are the only epidermal cells that express the specific CD1a surface antigen T6, we have used immunomagnetic monodisperse polymer microspheres for positive selection of human epidermal Langerhans and indeterminate cells. Epidermal cells in suspension are successively incubated with a murine monoclonal anti-T6 antibody of the IgG1 subclass and then with magnetic beads coated with a sheep anti-mouse IgG1. Rosetted cells are obtained and then easily separated from the non-rosetted cells using a magnet. The two cell fractions are characterized by phase contrast microscopy, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and the skin cell-lymphocyte reaction. All the rosetted cells (1.5 to 5% of the total epidermal cells) express T6 antigen by indirect immunofluorescence and under the electron microscope possess all the ultrastructural characteristics of Langerhans cells. Moreover, the rosetted Langerhans cells remain functional: Under the electron microscope they internalize by receptor-mediated endocytosis gold labeled anti-T6 antibody, and in the skin cell-lymphocyte reaction they stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes. In contrast, the rosette depleted cell fraction is deprived of T6 positive cells and unable to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes. The immunomagnetic depletion of epidermal cells is a simple and rapid method to isolate functional human Langerhans cells with good yield and high purity (97%). This technique should be of value in the study of the pharmacology of Langerhans cells and in the investigation of the interactions of Langerhans cells with keratinocytes or lymphocytes.\r"

Eighteen (37%) exposed infants developed ophthalmia neonatorum (n = 12) or infant conjunctivitis (n = 7), compared with six (15%) of the nonexposed infants (P = .04). Six (12%) exposed infants developed pneumonia, compared with none of the 40 nonexposed infants (P = .05). One infant in the exposed group died during follow-up. These results suggest that appreciable infant morbidity in Kenya may be associated with the high prevalence of maternal chlamydial infection.\r"

The epitope recognized by B-14 was further localized to include a decapeptide at the NH2-terminus of the CNBr fragment. The decapeptide inhibited the ELISA and western blot reactivity of B-14 with TSST-1, although it was approximately 10,000-fold less effective than the native toxin. The peptide also inhibited the capacity of B-14 to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity. A conjugate, consisting of decapeptide4-ovalbumin, was used to hyperimmunize three rabbits. Serum from these rabbits reacted specifically with intact TSST-1 in ELISA and western blots and partially neutralized toxin mitogenicity; however, the serum did not prevent fever and enhancement of susceptibility to endotoxin shock typically seen in rabbits after administration of TSST-1.\r"

Forty-nine infants received vaccine; 55 received placebo. Rotavirus disease during this season was predominantly caused by a serotype 1 strain. In placebo recipients there were 14 cases of rotavirus diarrhea (attack rate, 25%); 11 were moderate to severe (attack rate, 20%). Vaccinees experienced only three cases of rotavirus disease (attack rate, 6.1%), all mild. When all cases (whether associated with rotavirus or not) of clinically significant diarrhea (CSD) were evaluated, WC3 vaccine provided statistically significant (P less than .01) protection against the total number of episodes of CSD and reduced the number of days of CSD-associated diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or illness. Seventy-one percent of the WC3-vaccinated infants had serum antibody responses to the vaccine. The 14 placebo recipients who experienced natural disease predominantly had antibody responses to serotype 1. Sera taken after the rotavirus season revealed a nearly identical rate (40%) of natural rotavirus infection in the vaccinated and placebo groups.\r"

During the later phase of infection (seven to 14 days after challenge), titers of virus in the pancreas and salivary glands in mice infected with parent virus continued to rise, whereas no virus could be detected in mice infected with the ts mutants. Prior infection with parent virus or the ts mutants protected susceptible mice from a lethal dose of salivary gland MCMV. One year after infection, treatment of mice with an immunosuppressive regimen resulted in reactivation of parent and ts mutant virus. Reactivated virus recovered from mice infected with ts mutant virus remained temperature sensitive.\r"

Chang's medium without any supplementation gave significantly better fertilization rates (83.3%) than Chang's with 10% HS (76.4%) or T6 and BSA (76.6%) (P less than 0.01). In a separate experiment 87.7% of the two-cell mouse embryos developed to the blastocyst stage in Chang's medium, compared to 90.6% for T6 with BSA and 93.6% without BSA, respectively (P greater than 0.01). In Chang's medium supplemented with 10% HS, 76.6% of the embryos developed to the blastocyst stage and 17.2% stopped development after the morula stage. After 72 hr in vitro hatched trophoblast and inner-cell-mass cells from 26.5 and 30.8% of the embryos grown in Chang's medium (with and without HS) attached to the plastic culture dishes and grew to form a mixed monolayer of epithelioid and fibroblastic cells. Chang's medium can thus be successfully used for IVF and growth of mammalian embryos. Further, inner cell mass and trophoblast cell lines could be established for various reproductive studies using this medium.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperprolactinemia, induced by pituitary isografts for 20 weeks in male mice and confirmed by radioimmunoassay using anti-mouse prolactin serum, did not impair spermatogenesis in the testis and maturing processes of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Incubation of freshly obtained epididymal spermatozoa for 90 min in culture media containing various levels of mouse prolactin did not yield any adverse effects on percentage motility rates of epididymal spermatozoa. When the level of mouse prolactin in the preincubation medium for epididymal spermatozoa was 100 ng/ml, the rate of fertilization by these preincubated spermatozoa in the subsequent in vitro fertilization experiment was significantly lowered compared with that observed in controls. However, when the level of prolactin in preincubation media was 10 ng/ml, no significant reduction in the rate of fertilization occurred. The present experiments seem to indicate the existence of some differences in the effects of prolactin on male germ cells until they reach the tail of the epididymis and on the processes of capacitation and/or fertilization by epididymal spermatozoa after they leave the epididymis.\r"

This bioassay is based on the sensitivity of hamster epididymal spermatozoa to contaminants present in water and/or in the culture apparatus. The bioassay is usually performed using a modified Tyrode's solution as the sperm culture medium, although complex media can be used. The sensitivity of this test is greatly enhanced by the absence of protein in the medium. The bioassay has been used to detect impurities in water prepared by a standard cartridge filtration system and to verify that reverse-osmosis pretreatment of water could eliminate the problem. It has also detected toxic contaminants leached from syringe filters during medium sterilization. The bioassay is simple to perform and can be completed in 1 working day. It may be a useful alternative to the conventional mouse embryo tests that are in widespread use in human in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratories.\r"

Each medium was stored at 5 and -20 degrees C and tested every two weeks. All of the media deteriorated with increased storage time, but at different rates (TLP-PVA greater than TL-PVA greater than TALP-PVA). The deterioration of the media correlated with an increase in pH during storage, probably due to a loss of CO2 and bicarbonate. Albumin, added after storage, was able to rescue frozen TL-PVA.\r"

  ".W": "A study was undertaken to compare the hormonal parameters [serum concentrations of estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) and P/E2 ratios] of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer to whom either progesterone in oil or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered as luteal support. Seventeen patients were studied in 20 cycles. In 10 randomly assigned cycles 25 mg of intramuscular progesterone in oil was administered daily from the day of embryo transfer (day +4) until day +18. In the other 10 cycles, 1500 IU of hCG was given intramuscularly on days +4, +7, +10, and +13. Even when accounting for the differences in recruitment in the two groups, the hCG-treated group had significantly higher concentrations of serum P (P less than 0.01) and E2 (P less than 0.05) during the luteal phase. The luteal P/E2 ratios were higher in the progesterone-treated group because of the lower E2 levels in that group, although the difference was not statistically significant. The ratio of the mean luteal P to the preovulatory serum E2 was significantly higher in the hCG-treated group (P less than 0.01). There were three clinical pregnancies in the hCG-treated group. We conclude that (1) higher P concentrations are achieved with hCG treatment than with progesterone treatment during the luteal phase; (2) high luteal P/E2 ratios per se may not be an important determinant of implantation; (3) progesterone production by the corpus luteum is not maximal in progesterone-treated cycles; and (4) the usefulness of hCG as a luteal support agent should be further evaluated.\r"

None of the procedures of dehydration, rehydration, or freezing affected glycine uptake significantly. Earlier results for uptake of 125I-BSA by fresh embryos which indicated an increase in endocytic activity between morula and blastocyst stages were confirmed, and hydrolysis of endocytosed 125I-BSA by morulae but not two-cell embryos was observed. Only 53 +/- 9% of two-cell embryos but 83 +/- 7% of morulae were apparently normal after freezing and thawing. Apparently normal frozen/thawed two-cell embryos were twice as active in 125I-BSA uptake as controls. This was not the case for morulae. The results suggest that freezing/thawing effects endocytotic processes in two-cell embryos but not morulae.\r"

The procedure was modified by supplementing the cryoprotectant with 10% heat-inactivated and filtered (0.22 micron) maternal serum instead of fetal calf serum, and embryos were frozen in 500-microliter plastic straws instead of glass ampoules. After 12-25 weeks of storage in liquid nitrogen, 12 embryos from six patients were thawed at 8.0 degrees C min to room temperature, incubated in 75% maternal serum with Ham's F-10, and replaced in utero. One pregnancy occurred. The patient was a 34-year-old nulligravida with occluded fallopian tubes. A year prior, she conceived triplets from three embryos during an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, but she delivered at 21 weeks and the infants did not survive. The second IVF attempt produced four embryos. Two were replaced during the IVF cycle, but they did not implant. Two were cryopreserved and replaced 25 weeks later. On day 28 after replacement, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) was 4126 IU, but there was no gestational sac in utero on ultrasonographic examination. Laparoscopy disclosed a right tubal pregnancy which was removed with the fallopian tube. Histological examination demonstrated normal chorionic villi. The chromosomal pattern was 46 XX by direct analysis and cell culture.\r"

By using a novel in vitro red blood cell (RBC) chromium 51 cytotoxicity assay, cell injury induced by nitrofurantoin was quantified with normocatalasemic BALB/c RBCs and hypocatalasemic (but otherwise genetically identical) CCN RBCs as target cell populations. Nitrofurantoin at concentrations of 2 x 10(-4) and 4 x 10(-4) mol/L resulted in significant injury to normocatalasemic RBCs with a cytotoxic index (CI) of 21.7% +/- 3.7% and 65.3% +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.05, both comparisons). This injury was substantially increased when nitrofurantoin (2 x 10(-4) and 4 x 10(-4) mol/L was incubated with hypocatalasemic RBCs, resulting in CIs of 59.0% +/- 7.4% and 91.0% +/- 2.0% respectively (p less than 0.05, both comparisons with normocatalasemic RBCs). Direct oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity induced by either H2O2 or the superoxide anion radical (as generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase) also resulted in more significant injury to hypocatalasemic RBCs than to normocatalasemic RBCs (p less than 0.05, both comparisons). Catalase levels of CCN RBCs were approximately 7% of control BALB/c RBC values; however, the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were identical in both populations of RBCs. This model, using genetically defined target cell populations, clearly demonstrates the importance of endogenous catalase in protecting against nitrofurantoin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that H2O2 is a critical intermediary in the direct cell injury mediated by the drug.\r"

Seventeen patients without inhibitors against factor IX and three patients with inhibitor showed no abnormalities in their restriction fragments generated by digestions of the genomic DNA by BamHl, EcoRl, Mspl, or Taql and hybridized with a factor IX cDNA probe (pHFIX). The remaining four patients with inhibitors were found to have gross deletions of the factor IX gene. Among those four patients, two were from the same family. Quantitative Southern blotting clearly showed that the abnormal gene was inherited in this family. DNA from the mother of another patient with deletion of the factor IX gene showed normal gene dosage, indicating that the mutation must have occurred at the mother's germ cells. The genomic DNA samples of four patients with gross factor IX gene deletions were found to lack the entire factor IX gene as analyzed with a factor IX cDNA as well as with a 3'-genomic factor IX fragment as probes. The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene probe, however, was found to hybridize with all of these DNA samples, indicating that the deletions in these genomic DNA samples had not extended to the region containing the HPRT gene locus in q27 proximal to the factor IX gene locus on the X chromosome. Several clinical characteristics were compared between inhibitor cases with gene deletion and inhibitor cases without obvious gene deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 13 opened-chest anesthetized dogs, we recorded the maximal change in left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), mean aortic pressure (MAP), left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP) and rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (LV dp/dt) during left main coronary artery injections of 10 ml each of Hypaque-76, iopamidol, iohexol, and loversal 1 hour after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. The changes in LVSP and MAP were, respectively, -29 +/- 12 mm Hg and -21 +/- 11 mm Hg with Hypaque-76, 3 +/- 6.6 mm Hg and -0.2 +/- 3.6 mm Hg with iopamidol, 4.8 +/- 8.6 mm Hg and 0.5 +/- 4 mm Hg with iohexol, and -0.8 +/- 6 mm Hg and -1.5 +/- 33 mm Hg with ioversal (p less than 0.001). The change in LVDP was 5.4 +/- 4.4 mm Hg with Hypaque-76 but -1.5 +/- 3.1 mm Hg with iopamidol, -1.7 +/- 2.4 mm Hg with iohexol, and -0.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg with ioversol (p less than 0.001). The LV dp/dt decreased 682 +/- 318 mm Hg/sec with Hypaque-76, but increased 412 +/- 297 mm Hg/sec with iopamidol, 350 +/- 214 mm Hg/sec with iohexol, and 293 +/- 191 mm Hg/sec with ioversol (p less than 0.001). Thus, each nonionic agent produced significantly fewer hemodynamic abnormalities than Hypaque-76. There was no significant difference between any of the nonionic agents on any hemodynamic parameter. These agents may be preferable in patients with acute myocardial infarction or significantly impaired myocardial function.\r"

All patients had baseline values of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within the normal range. The group had a mean baseline kallikrein excretion of 98.30 +/- 29.98 micrograms/24 hours (mean +/- SEM), and 3 and 6 months after therapy was initiated, kallikrein excretion was 44% and 46% of baseline, respectively (p less than 0.01). The five patients who had a normal mean baseline kallikrein excretion rate (106.60 +/- 15.21 micrograms/24 hr) excreted significantly less (p less than 0.05) kallikrein 3 and 6 months after therapy was initiated (56.60 +/- 3.98 micrograms/24 hr and 34.50 +/- 11.02 micrograms/24 hr, respectively), as did one patient with an elevated baseline kallikrein. All six of these individuals completed the protocol. In a subgroup of four patients with low baseline levels (28.25 +/- 5.06 micrograms/24 hr), two individuals experienced elevations of BUN such that cyclosporine was discontinued; in the two who completed the protocol, there was some further decrement in kallikrein excretion. Kallikrein excretion increased in all patients after a 3-month washout period. During a low-dose (3 mg/kg/day) open extension study that followed the initial trial, kallikrein excretion was determined monthly. Seven episodes in which kallikrein excretion decreased in six patients by 44% +/- 18% over a 1-month interval preceded any increase in serum creatinine by 1 to 4 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whites have red cell densities (expressed as mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) that are, on the average, 0.7 gm/dl higher than those in blacks (the difference of the means has p less than 2 x 10(-7]. White men have, on the average, 0.6 gm/dl higher MCHC than white women (the difference of the means has p less than 6 x 10(-5]. We find a strong correlation between all red cell densities and intracellular K+ and a slightly weaker correlation between red cell density and intracellular Na+ + K+. Men have an average intraerythrocytic K+ that is approximately 4.5 mmol/L of red cells less than that of women among whites as well as blacks (p less than 10(-5) and p less than 9 x 10(-4), respectively). Blacks have significantly higher plasma ferritin levels than do whites (in addition to the sex difference). Future work will have to dissect the possible causes of these differences, which include the high incidence of deletional alpha-thalassemia (-a/aa) among blacks, menstruation, hormonal effects, and the red cell transport and volume regulation differences between sexes and races. Whatever the cause of the sex and racial differences reported here, they are bound to affect the pathophysiologic expression of genetic red cell diseases that are particularly sensitive to the MCHC, such as the sickle cell syndromes.\r"
