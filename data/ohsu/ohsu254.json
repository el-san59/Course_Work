We have produced syngeneic monoclonal anti-Id antibodies (mAb2) of the IgM isotype to a CMV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb1) that is known to bind to the 86,000-Da glycoprotein on the virion envelope. These mAb2 bear the internal image of the original viral antigen as shown by their ability to 1) recognize an interspecies idiotype in CMV-positive human antisera, 2) block mAb1 binding to CMV antigen, and 3) block CMV neutralization by mAb1 in vitro. Immunization of mice with both of these affinity chromatography-purified mAb2 stimulated the production of anti-anti-Id monoclonal antibodies (which we termed mAb3), which bound to the mAb2 by ELISA and neutralized CMV infectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of surgical wounds with toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus does not usually elicit a purulent response from the host. Because S. aureus is normally a pyogenic pathogen, this phenomenon suggests that strains of staphylococci that produce the exotoxin are able to inhibit the migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to sites of infection. We have considered that inhibition of leukocyte migration may be an effect of secreted TSST-1 and have studied direct and indirect effects of the exotoxin on migratory functions of PMN in vitro. Preincubation of PMN with TSST-1 produced no inhibition of random motility or FMLP- or C5a-stimulated chemotaxis under agarose. Supernatant fluids from mononuclear leukocytes incubated with TSST-1, however, were potently inhibitory for both PMN random and chemotactic migratory functions. The inhibitor of migration was identified as TNF based upon neutralization by anti-TNF antiserum and its presence in the culture supernatant fluids assayed in terms of cytotoxicity for murine TNF-sensitive L-929 cell line cells. Preincubation of PMN with recombinant human TNF also inhibited subsequent PMN random and chemotactic migratory functions. We propose that TSST-1 inhibits the mobilization of PMN to sites of infection by stimulation of monocyte/macrophage TNF production and suggest that TNF may also contribute to some other effects of toxic shock syndrome.\r"

An orderly sequence of cell migration and differentiation is maintained, and the full complement of terminally differentiated cells is retained on the surface of the culture for up to 65 days following subculture. The pattern of histodifferentiation of cultured stratified squamous epithelium differs according to the matrix upon which it is grown. Pliant, fine meshed gels of type III collagen are corrugated by the cultured keratinocytes with adjustments occurring in the various suprabasal cell strata that result in the retention of a flat stratum corneum. Such pliant gels can be stabilized by pouring a supporting underlayer of coarse type I guinea pig collagen. Keratinocytes grown directly on the irregular surface of guinea pig type I collagen migrate into spaces between collagen fibrillar bundles and aberrantly keratinize 20-30 days following subculture. Keratinocytes grown on a basement membrane do not aberrantly keratinize, suggesting that contact with a basement membrane may suppress signals for keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocytes also form hemidesmosomes opposite a basement membrane but not opposite collagen fibrils. The keratin pattern of oral keratinocytes cultured in different configurations does not change; a finding that indicates that a greater degree of tissue organization does not automatically result in the synthesis of keratins more characteristic of upper cell strata or cornified cells in the native tissue.\r"

The extruded disks are believed to undergo biochemical and biophysical changes to form the stratum corneum intercellular lipid sheets that constitute the epidermal permeability barrier. Little is known about this important component of epidermal differentiation, in part due to lack of a suitable in vitro model. We have demonstrated microscopically the presence of characteristic lipid membrane structures in a primary keratinocyte culture system which shows morphologic differentiation comparable to that seen in vivo. A basal cell-enriched fraction of isolated neonatal mouse keratinocytes was plated into Vitrogen-coated 30 mm Millicell (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts) wells, fed daily with Medium 199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 micrograms/ml each of insulin and hydrocortisone, and kept at 32 degrees C in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere in a humidified incubator. Three days after plating, cultures were placed on living, epidermis-free mouse dermis at the air/liquid interface. At 2 wk, histologic examination showed multiple well-organized cell layers, including a distinct granular layer and a well-developed stratum corneum. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated numerous lamellar granules and extrusion of their contents into the intercellular space. After fixation with ruthenium tetroxide, stacked intercellular lamellae in the stratum corneum were seen. Both the presence of dermis and growth at the air/liquid interface were necessary to achieve complete differentiation. This system conclusively demonstrates the formation of complex epidermal lipid structures in vitro and should allow the mechanisms and regulation of their synthesis to be elucidated.\r"

Using monoclonal antibodies we have identified IgE on the surface of cutaneous dendritic cells in both lesional and nonlesional skin. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrates these cells to be antigen-presenting cells. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) was not identified on such cells either in atopic individuals with no history of dermatitis or in patients with a range of other dermatoses. Further studies are consistent with IgE being bound to the cell surface via an Fc-IgE receptor. We conclude that this finding is specific for atopic dermatitis and thus may provide a link between the two types of hypersensitivity reactions frequently observed.\r"

The separation procedure used provided cultures that were essentially free from normal melanocytes (dermis) or fibroblasts (epidermis). In short term culture, nevus cells of all skin compartments expressed markers associated with differentiated melanocytes, such as presence of premelanosomes and melanosomes and elevated tyrosinase levels. Nevus cells also expressed melanoma-associated antigens, such as NGF-receptor, transferrin-related p97, proteoglycan, and HLA-DR as detected with monoclonal antibodies. After several subpassages, cells showed a decreased expression of melanoma-associated antigens, decreased tyrrosinase levels, and melanosomes could no longer be detected. Morphologically, these cells were similar to fibroblasts. The disappearance of melanoma-associated cell surface antigens was concomitant with the appearance of a melanocyte-associated 145 kd protein that might serve as a marker of fibroblast-like differentiation in nevus cells and normal melanocytes. Nevus cell cultures grown in the presence of 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate maintained a stable differentiated phenotype throughout their lifespan. As reported earlier, nevus cells in culture, irrespective of the presence or absence of 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, have a finite lifespan in vitro, grow anchorage-independent in soft agar, but do not form tumors when xenografted to nude mice. These studies demonstrate that nevus cells isolated from the epidermal, basal layer, and dermal components of lesional skin can serve as models to characterize the initial steps of tumor progression in a human cell system.\r"

They were assigned to complementation group E by the cell hybridization study. All showed lowered minimal erythema doses between those of normal Japanese and XP group A subjects at wavelengths of 280, 290, and 300 nm of monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) light. Patients XP80TO and XP81TO, but not patient XP82TO, showed a delayed peak reaction at 48 h to UV erythema. All fibroblast strains from these patients had a reduced level of 40%-44% unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) after irradiation with 10 J/m2 of 254 nm UV. Primary cultured epidermal cells from these patients exhibited a relatively low level of UDS (ie, 38%-51% of normal epidermal cells).

All of the above group E patients had mild XP symptoms, but not neurological abnormalities, at the fifth decade of age. Patients XP80TO and XP81TO had developed skin malignancies (patients XP80TO developed three basaliomas; patient XP81TO developed two basaliomas) at the ages of 46 and 41 yr, respectively.\r"

After a long-term cultivation macroconidial compartments changed to spherical thick-walled structure. Some 12-month-old macroconidia were still capable of germination. A wide range of temperature (15-37 degrees C), and inoculum of less than 1 X 10(5) conidia per ml of rich media were appropriate for macroconidial germination. The germination process of macroconidia was highly tolerant to NaCl. A small fraction of the conidia were able to germinate even in distilled water without activation. Effect of freeze-thaw or ultraviolet irradiation on macroconidial germination was determined.\r"

A decreased proportion of the shorter wave bands systematically increased the time to first tumor.

  ".W": "Since the first description of organic-soluble proteins (i.e., proteolipids), much attention has focused on the isolation, purification, characterization, localization, and function of these intrinsic membrane proteins in a variety of different tissues. Using a rapid purification scheme, which allowed the transfer of organic-soluble proteolipids to aqueous phases, we have isolated proteolipids from cultured human keratinocytes and human epidermis for the first time. A partial characterization of these proteolipids, including molecular-weight determination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), amino acid composition, and an N-terminal sequencing revealed a preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids (greater than 60% overall and greater than 78% in N-terminal sequence), typical of other proteolipids. The composition of fatty acids, covalently bound to whole purified apoprotein fractions, displayed a predominance of palmitic greater than oleic greater than stearic acids. Comparison of the molecular species of proteolipids isolated from whole epidermis with those obtained from keratinocyte cultures by SDS-PAGE revealed a comparable spectrum of apoprotein species. Finally, subcellular fractionation of cultured keratinocytes, used to localize proteolipids to specific cellular compartments, suggested that one of the major apoprotein species (30 kD) is present in mitochondria, whereas the lower molecular weight species are localized in plasma membrane-enriched fractions. Although evidence is lacking for a specific function(s) of this class of molecules in the epidermis, the hypothesis that it plays a role in epidermal differentiation, for example, as constituents of calcium and/or proton pumps, is discussed.\r"

Since it has been proposed that an analogous ectopic HLA-DR expression by epithelial cells in other organs might be an early event leading to organ-specific autoimmunity, we have investigated the sequence in which perifollicular mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration and ectopic HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes appear in recent-onset and long-standing cases of AA by immunostainings of affected and unaffected areas with monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte and HLA-DR antigens. In recent-onset AA lesions, ectopic HLA-DR expression on hair follicle keratinocytes was found only occasionally (in 3 out of 247 follicles examined) and was restricted to biopsies from the affected areas. This prevalence was significantly lower than the prevalence of hair follicles showing perifollicular MNC infiltrates in the same biopsies, and was also significantly lower than the prevalence of hair follicles showing ectopic HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes in the affected areas of longstanding cases. These findings suggest that in AA lesions the perifollicular MNC infiltration precedes the ectopic HLA-DR expression on hair follicle keratinocytes, and therefore argue against the notion of a primary role for that ectopic HLA-DR expression on epithelial cells in triggering the putative autoimmune response in AA.\r"

A considerable discontinuity in water content occurred between these two regions over the stratum corneum-stratum granulosum junction and the last granular cell layer. The dominance of the water profile by a discontinuity suggests water loss is governed by a partitioning process, presumably a partitioning into the lipid domain. A water discontinuity offers important functional advantages in the conservation of substances within the body and in protection from intruding molecules.\r"

The principal nonpolar components were cholesterol, free fatty acids and cholesteryl esters. Small and variable amounts of paraffin hydrocarbons, triglycerides, and an unidentified lipid were noted. In a series of time-course experiments, epidermal lipids were labeled by intradermal injection of [1-14C] acetate at varying times up to 21 days before removal of the epidermis. The hydrocarbons never acquired radioactivity, while the triglycerides retained label only for about 1 day after injection. Squalene and lanosterol retained considerable radioactivity for up to 12 h after labeling. Radioactivity appeared in free fatty acids and cholesteryl esters 2-3 days after labeling and began to decline after 21 days. Epidermis from uninjected sites did not acquire significant radioactivity. From these results it was concluded that cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and free fatty acids are synthesized locally in the epidermis and remain until lost by desquamation. Triglycerides are also synthesized but do not persist into the stratum corneum, so the small amounts found there may be environmental contaminants. Alkanes are not synthesized, and are most probably derived from petroleum waxes.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between nephritogenic antibodies and antigens in the glomerular capillary wall is influenced by physicochemical determinants such as the electrical charge. We studied the effect of neutralization of a negative glomerular capillary wall (GCW) charge by polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the binding of anti-renal tubular epithelium (RTE) IgG in passive Heymann nephritis. For these studies, glomerular binding of intravenously administered radiolabeled anti-RTE IgG was determined in Wistar rats preinjected 30 minutes earlier with either 0.2 ml 0.05% PEI (molecular weight 40,000 kd) or 0.2 ml saline solution; control rats received 0.025 mg radiolabeled nonimmune rabbit IgG (NRIgG) after PEl or saline solution. Glomerulus-bound antibody was measured in saline solution-perfused isolated glomeruli 1 hour after this injection. Intravenously administered radiolabeled anti-RTE IgG binding was found to be significantly increased in rats pretreated with PEI compared with those given saline solution. Intravenously administered radiolabeled NRIgG with or without pretreatment with PEl did not bind to the GCW. Administration of PEl had no effect on blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or renal plasma flow during antibody administration, which means that hemodynamic changes could not have been responsible for the observed differences in antibody binding. We conclude that binding of PEI to the GCW enhances fixation of anti-RTE IgG, probably because of neutralization of charged sites of the GCW leading to greater accessibility of intrinsic antigens present in the GCW to anti-RTE antibody.\r"

  ".W": "I examined whether the rate of ascites formation in cirrhosis is increased by volume expansion and whether this rate is related to the intensity of renal sodium retention, and I examined the mechanisms by which ascites is mobilized during diuresis. The plasma-ascites filtration rate (PFR) of intravenously injected iodine 125-labeled albumin (the rate of ascites formation by the liver) after volume expansion with normal saline solution in seven patients was similar to that observed in 14 patients who had not received infusions (0.010 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.013 +/- 0.006 L/hr/m2) and was unrelated to natriuresis both before and after intravenous administration of 80 mg furosemide the previous day (r = 0.04 and -0.36). Diuresis of seven patients who had not received infusions reduced PFR (from 0.679 +/- 0.267 to 0.411 +/- 0.198 L/day, P less than 0.05) and total ascites formation rate (from 3.029 +/- 1.620 to 1.465 +/- 1.053 L/day, P less than 0.02) but not plasma volume (from 3.464 +/- 0.646 to 3.391 +/- 0.775 L). Increases occurred in ascites albumin concentration (from 7 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 4 gm/L, P less than 0.05) and in the ascites/serum albumin ratio (from 0.26 +/- 0.12 to 0.35 +/- 0.13, P less than 0.05) but not in the serum-ascites albumin gradient (portal pressure). Fractional changes in ascites volume and albumin concentration were unrelated (r = 0.20). The calculated rate of ascites reabsorption decreased in five patients during diuresis, indicating that ascites was mobilized by decreased formation. Ascites reabsorption increased in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Indomethacin elevates the plasma erythropoietin titer of hypoxic anephric rats and probably does so by increasing extrarenal erythropoietin production. Because indomethacin is a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor, we postulated that it alters extrarenal erythropoietin production via its effects on tissue prostaglandin levels. Studies were, therefore, performed to determine the effects of indomethacin on hepatic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) titers. Indomethacin significantly decreased the PGF2 alpha level but its effects on the PGE2 level were, in most experiments, insignificant. We next studied the effects of infusing PGF2 alpha and PGE2 on the plasma erythropoietin levels of hypoxic rats. PGF2 alpha significantly reduced the plasma erythropoietin titer of anephric rats and neutralized the effect of indomethacin when both substances were administered. PGE2 infusion, on the other hand, did not significantly affect the plasma erythropoietin level of anephric rats. The data support the conclusion that PGF2 alpha is a potent inhibitor of extrarenal erythropoietin production, and that indomethacin enhances the rate of extrarenal erythropoietin production by reducing the PGF2 alpha titer in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Hemoglobin infused into rats was excreted mainly by the kidneys. The effects of hemoglobin on renal tubular functions were investigated in this study. During intravenous infusion of 6% stroma-free hemoglobin (SFHB) solution, there was a 30% reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The reduction in GFR was directly related to the urine hemoglobin concentration. The rate of urinary sodium excretion (8.2 mumol/min) was significantly higher than the control rate (2.8 mumol/min), suggesting proximal tubular damage in the presence of intratubular hemoglobin. This was further substantiated by the demonstration of a 10-fold increase in urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity during SFHB infusion. In contrast, dextran-hemoglobin (DXHB) infused into rats was not excreted by the kidneys. During the infusion of 6% stroma-free DXHB solution, there was no significant change in the GFR. Urinary sodium excretion was lower than the control value whereas urinary NAG activity was slightly elevated. The observations suggest that the presence of hemoglobin in the renal tubules gives rise to impairment of tissue function and structure. DXHB, on account of its larger molecular size, does not enter into the renal tubules, and therefore does not cause such impairment.\r"

Hyaluronic acid synthesis in organ cultures of normal canine synovial villi incubated with MGP was reduced in proportion to MGP concentration. Similar dose-dependent inhibition of sodium sulfate S 35-labeled glycosaminoglycan synthesis was observed in organ cultures of canine articular cartilage treated with MGP. In comparison, the intact cartilage of cultured femoral condyles appeared less sensitive to MGP inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Cartilage and synovium were examined 4 hours after an intra-articular injection of either MGP or its vehicle into canine stifles. No differences in Na2(35)SO4-glycosaminoglycan synthesis were observed between cartilage organ cultures prepared from the MGP-treated and the contralateral vehicle-treated joints, but in four of the five dogs studied less hyaluronic acid was synthesized (P less than 0.05) by synovial cultures from joints exposed to MGP than by cultures from the contralateral joints. Synovium from the MGP-treated joints remained capable of phagocytosis. These observations indicate that at clinically relevant concentrations MGP can inhibit synovial hyaluronic acid synthesis, but has little metabolic effect on normal articular cartilage.\r"

Selective PAF antagonists BN52021 and L652-731 have been shown to inhibit the action of PAF in vitro and in vivo. Using a unique isolated perfused rat lung model, we measured the effect of these PAF antagonists on PAF-induced pulmonary hypertension and edema. Isolated rat lungs were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution. The right and left pulmonary arteries were dissected so that they could be perfused selectively, permitting the use of one lung as an internal control for a specific pharmacologic challenge. Exposure of one lung to PAF induced an increase of perfusion pressure and wet/dry lung weight ratio in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control lung. The PAF antagonists attenuated the increase in perfusion pressure and wet/dry lung weight caused by PAF (0.75 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, prostaglandin F2 alpha induced an equivalent increase in pulmonary pressure without causing a similar increase in lung edema. PAF-induced pulmonary hypertension and the increase in wet/dry lung weight ratio appear to be PAF receptor-mediated processes, and the use of specific antagonists and this technique may be useful probes to determine the role of PAF in pathophysiologic states.\r"

Labelling efficiency of 67Ga-MPO was 6.5% to 45.8% (26.8% +/- 2.8%) when platelets were suspended in saline solution, but was much lower (1.6% +/- 0.8%) in plasma. Platelets labeled with either radioisotope in a saline medium survived as well as platelets labeled with 51Cr in plasma. Recovery values 1 hour after transfusion and mean platelet survivals were 68.6% +/- 4.9% and 3.4 +/- 0.2 days for 67Ga in saline solution, 76.5% +/- 6.8% and 3.8 +/- 0.5 days for 51Cr in saline solution, and 73.7% +/- 7.4% and 3.6 +/- 0.5 days for 51Cr in plasma. Labeled platelet concentrates always contained extra radioactivity not firmly bound to viable platelets. A postlabeling wash in saline solution did not reduce this contamination and resulted in reduction of the number of viable platelets. The results showed that rabbit platelets labeled with 67Ga-MPO survived in the circulation as well as those labeled by a standard protocol with sodium chromate Cr 51.\r"

  ".U": "88117145\r", 
  ".W": "Recently we demonstrated that increased chloride reabsorption in Henle's loop is a major contributor to the blunted furosemide response observed during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. Because antidiuretic hormone (ADH) modulates chloride reabsorption in the loop and because prostaglandin synthesis inhibition potentiates ADH-mediated water reabsorption, ADH may be necessary for the attenuated furosemide response observed during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. If such were the case, then prostaglandin synthesis inhibition should have no effect on furosemide's chloruretic response in the absence of ADH. To test this hypothesis, the effect of indomethacin on furosemide chloruresis was determined in homozygous (ADH-deficient) Brattleboro rats and in homozygous Brattleboro rats receiving ADH (2.4 mU/hr) over a short period of time. Furosemide-induced chloruresis was not different (P was not significant) between indomethacin-treated homozygous Brattleboro rats and homozygous Brattleboro rats receiving the indomethacin vehicle (fractional excretion of chloride: 6.28% +/- 1.08% vs. 6.24% +/- 0.98%). However, in ADH-infused Brattleboro rats, furosemide chloruresis was lower in indomethacin-treated rat groups than in vehicle-treated rat groups (fractional excretion of chloride: 3.09% +/- 0.62% vs. 6.61% +/- 0.88%; P less than 0.02) and lower than in indomethacin-treated ADH-deficient Brattleboro rats as well (P less than 0.05). Mean arterial pressure, inulin clearance, and renal blood flow were not different between any groups. Urinary prostaglandin excretion rates were not different between ADH-deficient Brattleboro rats and ADH-treated Brattleboro rats during furosemide administration and were markedly reduced by indomethacin in both circumstances. Thus, ADH is necessary for the blunted furosemide response observed during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The abnormal hemoglobins were originally detected in cord blood hemolysates by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and presumptively identified according to their mobilities. Hemolysates that contained a hemoglobin variant again underwent electrophoresis and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For identification, the membrane was treated with the appropriate rabbit monospecific antiserum and developed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or peroxidase-conjugated protein A. After the addition of substrate, a violet reaction developed at the site of the hemoglobin band, signifying an antigen-antibody reaction or a positive reactivity. The use of monospecific antisera in an immunoblot technique allows for confirmed identification of variant hemoglobins in cord blood samples in as little as 5 hours. In some cases in which the variant is near the limits of detectability by protein staining, the immunoblot allows an unequivocal identification.\r"

One year later, these patients were followed up with a chart review, reassessment of fatigue (by RIV score), and a telephone interview. Seventy-three (64 percent) fatigued and 72 (53 percent) nonfatigued patients provided this information. On the RIV, 31 patients moved from the fatigued group to nonfatigued, and 15 nonfatigued patients' scores changed to the fatigued category. Patients categorized as fatigued in 1984 (by RIV score) returned for office visits more often (mean of 3.85 vs 2.51, P less than .05), and developed significantly more new diagnoses (2.75 vs 1.68, P less than .05) over the follow-up year, compared with those not fatigued. Fatigued patients also had a greater proportion of diagnoses containing a psychologic component than nonfatigued patients. Persistence of fatigue over the year was significantly associated with race and education (nonwhites and those completing high school remaining fatigued). No significant association between marital status, age, sex, employment status, and either the resolution or development of fatigue over the year was found.\r"

  ".W": "A two-part closed-end survey similar to a survey done in 1980 was given to 25 family physicians at an academic family medical center to assess physician knowledge about five insurance programs covering most of the patients seeking care in the center, and to assess physician attitudes about the capitated insurance plan with which the clinic was affiliated. Results did not differ significantly from those obtained in a similar survey four years earlier at the same center. Physicians correctly identified benefits offered by insurance programs only about one half of the time and many did not ascertain patient insurance coverage at all. Physicians considered the most important advantages of capitated health care to be the patient protection from fees for services obtained, the coverage for health care maintenance, and the potential for controlling health care costs. Physician-perceived disadvantages included difficulties controlling costs generated by other specialists, dealing with after-the-fact authorization requests, controlling access to services, and obtaining information about costs within the capitated system.\r"

Consultation rates for first-, second-, and third-year residents were 48, 28, and 26 percent, respectively. The mean durations of consultations were 7.7, 6.9, and 6.1 minutes, respectively. Attending physicians visited 20, 12, and 13 percent of the patients of first-year, second-year, and third-year residents. The more senior residents displayed fewer of most types of interactional behaviors, suggesting a more focused discussion. Senior residents showed a progressive increase in initiating interactions of all types, demonstrating a kind of clinical independence and educational assertiveness that progressed through three years. There is a growing consensus that teaching in ambulatory medical practices will become widespread, but little information directs educational efforts in these settings. The findings suggest that clinical independence in the ambulatory setting is progressive and that measurements of consultation rates and behaviors expand knowledge about education in ambulatory care.\r"

Patient services increased by 40 percent, placing a heavy clinical load on faculty and third-year residents. There were significant increases in referral to psychology, psychotherapy, ophthalmology, and otolaryngology specialists. The high demand for services caused logistical difficulties for office and nursing staff. Adaptation to these changes and cost-containment efforts were hampered by institutional relationships. Strategies to manage the impact included hiring additional staff and part-time clinicians, introducing quality assurance and internal control procedures, and repeated orientation to the prepaid plan. Overall, the impact of the plan was of educational value to both residents and faculty.\r"

Each patient served as his or her own control. The maximum serum cholesterol at the beginning of the diet period was 8.69 +/- 2.15 mmol/L (336 +/- 83 mg/dL) (mean plus or minus standard deviation; n = 37). The goal cholesterol was less than 5.20 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). On diet alone the cholesterol level fell to 7.21 +/- 1.27 mmol/L (279 +/- 49 mg/dL) (P less than .001); and goal cholesterol was reached by 12 of 37 patients (32.4 percent), but was maintained in none.

Twenty-one percent of those without a listed mental disorder diagnosis received psychotropic medications, almost one third of which were antipsychotic medications.

Only 45 (16 percent) planned to continue delivering babies beyond 1989. Family physicians who started practice within the past seven years were less likely to include obstetrics in their first year of practice than those who began practice prior to 1980. To those physicians who have eliminated obstetrics from their practice in the past five years, fear of litigation and increasing malpractice insurance costs were significantly more important issues than to their colleagues who had stopped doing obstetrics prior to 1976. Every year fewer family physicians choose to provide care to their obstetric patients. The results of this study suggest that only with changes in the medicolegal and liability environments will obstetrics continue to be a part of family practice in Ohio.\r"

However, 84 percent of the hospitals where graduates are located either require documentation or would find it helpful for privilege application. The three-year cumulative experiences of the 1986 cohort of graduating residents are also presented. Thirty-six of the residents (71 percent) participated actively in the voluntary network documentation system.

  ".W": "Influenza is usually a minor, self-limiting illness, but for the elderly, especially the elderly who have chronic illnesses, it may be a severe or fatal disease. During influenza epidemics this disease may not always be recognized clinically as influenza but may appear as an acute decompensation in a patient with a known chronic illness. The influenza vaccine is not perfect, but it has been shown to be effective in the elderly. Reactions to the vaccine are usually minor and administration costs are low. Experience with influenza vaccine since the early 1940s has led to an improved, more pure vaccine formulation, has developed worldwide systems of tracking the dominant circulating viral strains, and has refined recommendations for vaccine usage based on clinical studies of its efficacy and cost effectiveness. Physicians should be aware of the present limitations of the existing studies and the imperfections of the vaccines, but in the elderly population, a proven intervention that will offer a substantial degree of protection during the influenza season should not be withheld. Most of the existing evidence suggests that the vaccine is effective and that physicians should be more stringent in their influenza immunization practices with the elderly. The elderly who are at high risk should be of high priority for receiving influenza vaccine, and the vaccine should also be recommended to healthy individuals aged 65 years and older because of its proven efficacy for reducing attack rates when appropriate viral strains are used.\r"

  ".W": "It is true that persons aged over 65 years have greater morbidity and mortality from influenza. This increased morbidity and mortality, however, is mostly the result of a higher prevalence of other chronic diseases in the elderly. There is no evidence that vaccination, even in epidemic years when the antigenic match of the influenza strain and the vaccine is good, benefits the 60 percent of the noninstitutionalized population over the age of 65 years who do not have other high-risk diseases. In fact, the grade II-3 evidence cited by the US Preventive Services Task Force actually supports not immunizing this population group. Even among high-risk patients, the benefit from influenza vaccination is highly variable and difficult to demonstrate. In some years there will be little influenza, and little benefit will accrue; in other years the vaccine-influenza antigenic match will not be good, and little benefit will be obtained. In a few years (two of the 12 years during which Barker's studies were done), a reduction in morbidity can be demonstrated for high-risk elderly persons. Even then, vaccine efficacy is only about 33 percent. Patients are telling physicians that they do not feel influenza vaccination is worthwhile. Less than 25 percent of high-risk persons are vaccinated annually. Many of those vaccinated do so because they falsely believe influenza vaccination will prevent the common cold. In accordance with the ACIP recommendation, high-risk patients with concomitant chronic disease (priority 1) should be immunized, because at least some benefit can be demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A case of a \"rapid cycler\" who showed increased PEA excretion before the switch from mania into depression was reported. In order to evaluate whether the patient's cycle of moods could be prevented by modulating PEA metabolism, carbidopa (peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor) and safrazine (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) were administered during the manic and depressive periods of the patient, respectively. Carbidopa exacerbated the manic symptoms, although it decreased PEA excretion. Safrazine induced the increase of PEA without any beneficial effect on the depressive symptoms. These findings may suggest that PEA plays the role of a biochemical trigger in the switch mechanism of a rapid cycler, especially in the switch from mania to depression.\r"

The SPE provides a consistent replicable format for eliciting and recording psychiatric history, signs, and symptoms without perturbing the patient-clinician interaction. By means of the SPE, the clinician can formulate diagnoses using DSM-III or ICD-9 criteria and yet generate CATEGO profiles derived from the Present State Examination, 9th edition. Psychiatrists using the SPE demonstrated high interrater reliability in ascertaining individual psychopathological symptoms (Kappa range, 0.55 to 1.0) and in making DSM-III diagnoses (Kappa range, 0.79 to 1.0) among a sample of study subjects (N = 43) drawn from both a psychiatric inpatient population and a large community sample of nonpatients from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study. The implications of the SPE for clinical practice and for research are discussed.\r"

The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and the development of squamous metaplasia usually were mutually exclusive. Autopsy findings in two patients and clinical work-up in five failed to disclose a primary extraneural malignancy. It is suggested that squamous differentiation may represent an extreme form of epithelial metaplasia in a malignant glioma. This possibility should be kept in mind in the diagnostic evaluation of such cases, especially in view of the current emphasis on the immunomorphologic demonstration of intermediate filament tumor markers.\r"

Four cell lines derived from human malignant gliomas (12-18, U-251 MG, I29-A, 7-24) and two lines from human fetal brain (CHI, CHII) were cultured in the presence and in the absence of human beta-interferon (HuIFN-beta), 1,000 units per ml medium for three days before harvesting. Human beta-interferon had an inhibitory effect on growth of glioma but not fetal brain cells. Total ganglioside sialic acid for all cell lines ranged between 3.5 and 13.8 micrograms/10(7) cells (0.6-3.9 micrograms/mg protein). No distinct difference in the amount of total ganglioside per cell was observed between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells, but the latter had more ganglioside per mg total protein. All cell lines displayed different patterns of gangliosides determined by high performance thin layer chromatography, but there was no distinct difference between glioma and fetal brain cells. Human beta-interferon increased the total amount of ganglioside per cell in one fetal brain and two glioma lines, but on a protein basis in only one glioma cell line (I29-A); HuIFN-beta had only minor effects on ganglioside patterns. There was a slight shift towards a greater proportion of structurally simpler gangliosides in both fetal brain and two glioma cell lines exposed to HuIFN-beta, but the reverse occurred in glioma U-251 MG. None of these changes strongly correlated with the degree of growth inhibition due to HuIFN-beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With larger volumes (100 microliters) there is an increase in ICP which is associated with systemic effects on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Neuropathological evidence of ischemic brain damage was found surrounding the mass in all animals, but this was independent of whether the mass was removed or not. These studies suggest that with a mass that corresponds to the size seen most commonly with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in man, focal ischemic brain damage is produced without reduction in global CPP.\r"

In lesser numbers, SP also occur in the brains of nondemented aged humans and nonhuman primates. To date, it is not known whether neurites in individual SP derive from neurons of one or several neurotransmitter systems. In aged monkeys, two strategies were used to test the hypothesis that individual SP can contain abnormal neurites arising from multiple neuronal systems. First, immunocytochemical methods were used to identify somatostatin-immunoreactive neurites in plaques, and these sections were subsequently stained with silver to visualize other neurites. Numerous plaques contained both somatostatin-positive and somatostatin-negative (i.e. argyrophilic only) neurites, suggesting that more than one transmitter system contributed neurites to each of these plaques. Second, two-color immunocytochemical techniques showed, in a small percentage of plaques, that cholinergic neurites coexist with neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing neurites or catecholaminergic neurites. These results suggest that the formation of SP may result from events that involve abnormalities of neuronal processes arising from multiple transmitter systems.\r"

Because neurons whose axons have been injured (e.g. by axotomy) show alterations in their structural and chemical properties, the present study was designed to differentiate the direct effects of AC intoxication from neuronal responses secondary to axonal injury caused by AC. Rats were given AC as either a single high dose (75 mg/kg), or as daily intraperitoneal injections (30 mg/kg, six days per week for four weeks). Dorsal root ganglia of the fifth lumbar level, L5, were examined using a variety of monoclonal antibodies directed against nonphosphorylated (2-135) and phosphorylated (03-44, 06-17, 07-05) epitopes of 145 and 200 kilodalton neurofilament proteins. In control rats, antibody 2-135 stained axons and neuronal cell bodies; antibodies against phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments stained only axons distal to the glomerulus. Following chronic AC intoxication, all three antibodies directed against phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments (particularly 07-05) demonstrated intense immunoreactivity in 20-30% of neuronal cell bodies. In addition, the glomerular region of these axons was stained. Electron microscopy revealed many chromatolytic cells containing few neurofilaments. In contrast, a single high dose of AC produced no abnormal staining of neuronal cell bodies at a time when slow axonal transport was impaired. Our findings are compared to those observed following axotomy and to those occurring in aluminum-intoxicated rabbits, two experimental disorders in which altered distributions of phosphorylated filaments have been documented.\r"

Gliophilic neuronal migration was confirmed in the human fetus, with radial glial fibers (RGF) acting as obligatory corridors for neuronal migration in the prospective neocortex and underlying intermediate zone (IZ). With this method, the entire glial phase was differentiated from neuronal elements; this permitted a description of the evolutionary distribution pattern of RGF: in the cortical plate, glial fascicles fully dissociate by 18 weeks gestation, whereas in the IZ, they remain grouped in fascicles until their transformation into astrocytes. The most conspicuous and constant developmental feature observed in the maturing glial cytoplasm between 21 and 30 weeks gestation was a radical enhancement in the abundance and activity of the lysosomal apparatus and autophagic vacuoles observed in the RGF, a cytological basis for the transformation of radial glial cells into astrocytes. These data have implications for the understanding of the ontogenesis of the neocortical vertical modules in the human brain and for the phylogenetic analysis of the vertical cortical units in terms of comparative mammalian anatomy.\r"

In this report two cases are presented in which the adenoid pattern was associated with papillary formations mimicking the arrangement of a medulloepithelioma.

Overall this seasonality was more strongly associated with the computed chilling effect of the atmosphere than with changes in temperature, humidity or wind speed alone. No seasonal variation was observed for admission rates of intracerebral haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack or occlusion of precerebral arteries. Intracerebral haemorrhage admission rates exhibited a decrease with time. This evidence suggests that seasonal variation in admission rates exists only for certain pathological types of stroke and this is strongly associated with changes in the chilling effect of the atmosphere.\r"

For both sexes, the incidence of gout showed no clear relationship with age. Among men who never received diuretics, those afflicted by gout, as compared to those without gout, experienced a 60% excess of coronary heart disease (95% confidence limits, 1.1-2.2), primarily attributed to a two fold excess of angina pectoris (95% confidence limits, 1.2-3.1). Although gout was usually associated with other atherogenic risk factors, control of systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, alcohol intake, body mass index, and diabetes failed to alter the effect of gout on the preceding coronary events in men. For women, there were no significant associations between gout and coronary heart disease. We conclude that gout, unrelated to the intake of diuretics, imparts an additional risk of coronary heart disease in men, unexplained by clinically measured risk factors.\r"

Validity was assessed in this study by examining the ability of measurements to distinguish between groups of patients who differed either in the presence of metastatic disease or in the treatments they were receiving. All patients completed the same set of 29 linear analogue scales that enquired about the severity of health related problems and symptoms. In general, patients with metastatic disease were clearly distinguished from patients without metastases by their scores on items related to physical function. Patients receiving chemotherapy were distinguished from those not receiving chemotherapy by their scores on treatment related toxicities. Measures of psychological and social health were similar in patients receiving chemotherapy regardless of disease status. These results provide further support for the validity of measurement of clinical status with linear analogue scales scored by patients.\r"

One physician (Doctor A) was the physician responsible for conducting examinations on the main cohort from which these participants were selected. Intra-observer agreement was assessed by comparing Doctor A's examinations on these participants with those he had recently conducted within a one and a half month period in the main study. Acceptable levels of intra-observer agreement (kappa = 0.72) and interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.66) were demonstrated for the presence or absence of generalized lymphadenopathy for Doctor A and Doctor B, a physician who periodically replaced Doctor A in the main project. Agreement between Doctors A, B, and C, was less satisfactory (kappa of 0.45 and 0.39, respectively). Doctor C was the least experienced with the standardized examination. However, during the progress of this study, agreement between the three doctors improved (kappa values for the latter 16 participants ranged from 0.60 to 0.86) suggesting that experience with the criteria and the standardization of the examination may enhance agreement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Demographic and disease specific clinical features are commonly used to established similarity, but these may not insure prognostic comparability. To identify the generic predictors of one year survival after hospitalization, a cohort of 559 patients admitted to the medical service at New York Hospital was studied. Among all of the clinical and demographic information available at the time of admission, only three were independent predictors of the time until death: functional ability, severity of illness and extent of comorbid disease. The overall one year survival rate was 66%. Six subgroups composed of patients with different combinations of the predictors of prognosis had mortality rates ranging from 97% to 14%. Illness severity was a predictor only in the less functional patients, and only severe comorbidity was associated with a decreased survival after taking into account functional ability and illness severity. Prospective estimates of severity of illness, functional ability and extent of comorbidity can be used to stratify a diverse group of patients according to their probability of one year survival after hospitalization.\r"

After excluding those with known coronary heart disease at baseline, age-adjusted rates for coronary heart disease, sudden, and stroke death are 19-37% higher in urban than rural men. Urban men had higher average blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and heart rate and were less physically active than rural men. When urban-rural differences for the known risk factors, including education and alcohol intake, are adjusted for by multivariate logistic regression analysis, no remaining significant urban-rural coronary heart disease mortality differential is present. Thus, it appears that variation in identified risk factors could explain the difference in mortality within Puerto Rico. The presence of unidentified protective factors cannot be excluded.\r"

Univariate analysis showed that men with major or minor ECG abnormalities, ST depression, high R wave, T-wave inversion, left ventricular hypertrophy or strain and premature ventricular contractions had considerably higher (2-10 fold) CHD incidence rates than those with normal ECG. When blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index, alcohol use, physical activity, serum glucose, serum cholesterol, serum uric acid, age and years lived in Japan were taken into consideration through multivariate analysis, the ECG abnormalities retained significant associations with fatal and total CHD. This study demonstrated that resting ECG abnormalities were independent predictors of both total and fatal CHD.\r"

For inpatients, the prevalence of hypoxemia preoperatively, 5 minutes after arrival in recovery, 30 minutes later, and at discharge was 2%, 4%, 6%, and 9%, respectively. Patient factors associated with a significantly higher prevalence of hypoxemia were obesity (22%), body cavity surgical procedures (24%), age over 40 years (18%), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (I, 7%; II, 17%; III, 18%; IV, 100%), duration of anesthesia longer than 90 minutes (18%), and intraoperative administration of greater than 1,500 ml of fluid (20%). Unrecognized hypoxemia in postsurgical inpatients with or without these risk factors is common. Therefore routine monitoring of these patients with a pulse oximeter is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Oscillometrically determined brachial artery pressures were compared with simultaneous contralateral radial intraarterial pressures in 19 anesthetized adult cardiac surgical patients throughout their surgical procedures, interrupted only by nonpulsatile, low-pressure, low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. Radial intraarterial pressure values ranged widely for systolic (55 to 207 torr), mean (43 to 141 torr), and diastolic (26 to 106 torr). Both error specification methods proposed by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation were used and compared. As expected, error method 1 gave consistently lower mean errors, smaller error standard deviations, and higher correlation coefficients than did error method 2. The errors during time periods immediately before and after cardiopulmonary bypass were compared with those from more quiescent times. Higher mean errors, larger error standard deviations, and lower correlation and regression coefficients were found during those time periods surrounding cardiopulmonary bypass. In general, mean errors were lowest for systolic pressure, followed by mean and diastolic pressures in that order, whereas error standard deviations were smallest for mean pressure, followed by systolic and diastolic pressures. Correlation and regression coefficients were highest for systolic pressure, followed by mean and diastolic pressures. In summary, the oscillometric method provides convenient and reproducible estimates of radial intraarterial pressure during most clinical situations, typically with better accuracy than the auscultatory Korotkoff method. The accuracy and reproducibility are diminished during those periods immediately surrounding cardiopulmonary bypass, perhaps due to direct surgical manipulation of the heart with its attendant rapid changes in cardiac output and blood pressure.\r"

Three hundred twenty-nine simultaneously sampled blood/oximeter data pairs from use of both makes of pulse oximeters on each of 152 test subjects were included in the comparison analysis for each oximeter. Among the patients, disease type and severity and hospital location varied widely. Basic descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were employed to facilitate comparison. Both oximeters displayed a statistically significant but clinically insignificant bias when compared with arterial blood oxyhemoglobin: -0.31 (P = 0.023) and 0.59 (P = 0.001) for the Ohmeda 3700 pulse oximeter and the Nellcor N-100 pulse oximeter, respectively.

We quantified the differences between the automated and handwritten records generated from the same 30 patients (2,412 minutes of general anesthesia for elective eye surgical procedures). Considering the design of the study, we claim that the differences between both records were caused by the incompleteness or inaccuracy of the handwritten records, except in two instances. The amounts of missing or erroneous data for these eight physiological variables were expressed as fraction (\"error fractions\") of the time being recorded, designated EFm and EFe, respectively. For the first five variables the EFm on the handwritten records ranged between 0.23 and 0.31, and the EFe ranged between 0.01 and 0.06. For the last three variables the EFm range was 0.08 to 0.13, and the EFe range was 0.05 to 0.11. Most of these missing or erroneous data occurred during the period of induction (first 15 minutes) and at the end of the case (last 10 minutes). The EFm and EFe during induction had increased to 0.62 and 0.26, respectively, and to 0.76 and 0.06, respectively, at the end of the case. Erroneous data were observed on the automated records for the tidal volume during induction (EFe = 0.0044) and for the oxygen fraction during maintenance (EFe = 0.0024). The effect of averaging by the recordkeeper is discussed. The results of this study indicate the clinical relevance of automated record keeping.\r"

The system consists of a microcomputer and six laboratory analyzers: a blood gas analyzer, a flame photometer, a plasma osmotic pressure meter, a chloride ion titrator, a blood sugar analyzer, and a hemoglobin concentration and saturation meter. With the addition of a previously developed microinterface unit to each laboratory analyzer, data from each analyzer can be automatically transmitted to the microcomputer through a communication network. These data are then automatically transmitted to the patient data management system and thereby become part of that data base. Performance of this system was evaluated in two ways: (1) by comparing the turnaround time from an anesthetist's order for a laboratory analysis to receipt of the analysis with the time required in a control situation and (2) by comparing the number of steps a laboratory technician is required to walk to obtain and deliver the laboratory result with the number of steps required in a control situation in which no system was used. The turnaround time and the number of steps walked using this system were 552 +/- 41 seconds (n = 19, P less than 0.001) and 197 +/- 31 steps, respectively (n = 19, P less than 0.001), contrasted with 622 +/- 52 seconds and 374 +/- 87 steps without the system.\r"

One hundred thirty-five arterial blood samples ranging in saturation from 63 to 100% were obtained from 15 adults, aged 20 to 43 years. These subjects had different skin pigmentation, hematocrit, and smoking habits. Steady-state hypoxia was achieved by varying the inspired oxygen concentration between 10 and 21%. Readings from the Datascope ACCUSAT pulse oximeter and the Hewlett-Packard 47201A ear oximeter were compared with arterial blood samples analyzed by the Instrumentation Laboratories IL 282 in vitro CO-Oximeter. The equation for the best fitted linear regression line between the ACCUSAT pulse oximeter and the reference IL 282 CO-Oximeter was: ACCUSAT = 1.08(IL) - 6.86. The linear regression analysis revealed a high degree of correlation (r = 0.99), and a small standard error of the estimate (SEE = 1.29%). Simultaneous comparisons between arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation measured with the ACCUSAT pulse oximeter and the Hewlett-Packard ear oximeter also showed a close correlation (r = 0.99, SEE = 1.47%). A similar comparison between the ACCUSAT and the Ohmeda 3700 pulse oximeter revealed good correlation (r = 0.99, SEE = 1.72%). We found that the ACCUSAT pulse oximeter is an accurate instrument for measuring arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation noninvasively in the range between 60 and 100%.\r"

The primary site included stomach (16 patients), small bowel (seven), large bowel (two), and mesenteric nodes (one). Following surgery, nine patients had macroscopic and four patients had microscopic residual disease, and 13 were felt to have had complete surgical resection. Thirteen patients were stage I and 13 were stage II. Sixteen patients were treated with COPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone), nine with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), and one with CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone). At a median follow-up of 50 months (8+ to 178+ months) ten of 12 stage I patients and nine of 14 stage II patients remain alive. Of the nine patients with macroscopic residual disease, four died of disease 6.5 to 11.0 months after diagnosis, and five are alive 8+ to 178+ months from diagnosis. Fourteen of the remaining 17 patients who had complete surgical resection are alive without disease. Death in the other three patients was due to multiple abdominal abscesses at 12 months, adenocarcinoma of the colon at 57 months, and dementia and progressive neurologic dysfunction at 65 months. No patient who had complete resection has relapsed or developed systemic disease after chemotherapy. These results suggest that complete surgical resection is an important prognostic factor and that chemotherapy without irradiation in completely resected localized GI-NHL can prevent local and systemic relapse resulting in long-term disease-free survival.\r"

Median age at diagnosis was 15 years (range, 6 to 29), and median age at the time of interview was 25.5 years (range, 14 to 40). Patients had received a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens, the most common of which was a combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (N = 28). Since discontinuation of chemotherapy, one patient remains premenarchal, and 27 patients have maintained regular menses. The other 12 patients have had menstrual difficulties, but in only three were the problems considered to be serious. Of the 16 patients who have attempted to become pregnant since completing chemotherapy, 11 have delivered 22 healthy infants, none of whom had major birth defects. Only one patient has had persistent problems with infertility. In summary, it appears that the majority of patients who receive combination chemotherapy for malignant ovarian germ cell tumors can anticipate normal menstrual function and a reasonable probability of having normal offspring.\r"

Plasma protein C levels were measured by anticoagulant, amidolytic, and antigenic techniques. Antigen levels of both total and free plasma protein S were quantitated by immunoelectrophoresis. Plasma levels of protein C, an important vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of blood coagulation and a profibrinolytic agent, and protein S, a cofactor for protein C, decreased 1 and 2 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy compared with pretreatment values. Plasma levels of factor VII and fibrinogen also decreased. The changes in protein C and protein S may contribute to the enhanced thrombotic tendency described in this setting. Possible mechanisms for the decreases in plasma protein C, protein S, factor VII, and fibrinogen are discussed.\r"

The endpoint was length of survival from randomization, which occurred within 3 weeks of definitive surgery. Following randomization, patients were scheduled to receive radiotherapy (RT) (6,020 cGy) during a 7-week period, along with continuing courses of chemotherapy. Computed tomographic (CT) scan information was available for 124 patients preoperatively, 300 patients postoperatively (preradiation), and 218 patients 9 weeks post-RT (+/- 3 weeks). Tumor size was determined as area (length x width) on the contrast-enhanced scan and survival was compared by log rank statistics. Preoperative tumor area was unrelated to survival (P = .48), but postoperative area was significantly prognostic (P less than .0001); the smaller the residual tumor, the longer the patient lived. Patients with a 75% or greater resection, as determined by measuring the difference between the preoperative and the postoperative scans, tended to have better survival, but the difference was not significant (P = .16). The post-RT area was strongly related to survival (P less than .00001). The percent change in area between the pre- and post-RT scans was also prognostic. Tumor size was of prognostic importance independent of the other known prognostic variables: age, Karnofsky performance score, and whether the tumor was glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. We conclude that the amount of tumor remaining after surgery is an important baseline variable at the start of RT, and that the tumor size 9 weeks following RT is also prognostic. Surgical resection is most important when it leaves the least amount of residual tumor.\r"

A phase I trial of rH-TNF was initiated using a five-day continuous intravenous (IV) infusion repeated every 28 days. Thirty-eight courses of therapy were administered to 19 patients. The starting dose was 5 X 10(4) U/m2/d, with escalations to 1.0 X 10(5), 2.0 X 10(5), 2.4 X 10(5), and 3.0 X 10(5) U/m2/d. Systemic side effects, including fever, chills, hypotension, fatigue, anorexia, and headaches, were mild and self-limiting. At the maximum tolerated dose of 3.0 X 10(5) U/m2/d, dose-limiting hematologic toxicity was manifested by transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Elevated bilirubin levels were also seen at the higher dose levels. Lipoprotein analysis demonstrated that the five-day treatment with rH-TNF was associated with decreases in high-density lipoproteins, as well as increases in triglycerides and very-low-density lipoproteins. Pharmacokinetic studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test indicated plasma rH-TNF levels less than 0.2 U/mL. The recommended phase II dose of rH-TNF administered as a five-day continuous infusion is 2.4 X 10(5) U/m2/d.\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic dissections of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in 18 patients aged 19 to 55 years were studied. All had suffered blunt head or neck injury of marked or moderate severity; motor-vehicle accidents were the leading cause of the injury. Delayed focal cerebral ischemic symptoms were the most common presenting symptoms. Less commonly noted was focal unilateral headache associated with oculosympathetic paresis or bruit. Following a head injury, the abrupt onset of focal cerebral symptoms after a lucid interval should raise the suspicion of arterial injury, particularly when computerized tomography fails to show abnormalities that would explain the evolving neurological deficits on the basis of direct trauma to the brain. Unilateral headaches, oculosympathetic palsy, and bruits also help in establishing the diagnosis. Focal cerebral ischemic symptoms may develop months or years after the initial trauma. These delayed symptoms are caused by embolization from a thrombus within a residual dissecting aneurysm. Common angiographic findings, in decreasing order of frequency, are: aneurysm, stenosis of the lumen, occlusion, intimal flap, distal branch occlusion (embolization), and slow ICA-to-middle cerebral artery flow. Although two patients died as the result of massive cerebral infarction and edema and some were left with severe neurological deficits, most made a good recovery. Residual dissecting aneurysms and occlusion seem to occur more frequently with traumatic dissections than with spontaneous dissections of the extracranial ICA.\r"

This hypothesis would account for many of the pathological features in AVM's, including intimal hyperplasia and arterial thrombosis with or without organization. In this study, a dual-isotope method employing indium-111-labeled platelets and technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells was used to evaluate in vivo platelet aggregation in 20 patients with AVM's. The use of two isotopes allows subtraction of the blood-pool platelets and calculation of the ratio of the indium deposited:the indium in the blood pool (In(D)/In(BP)). After a 24-hour incubation period, eight of the 20 patients demonstrated platelet aggregation in their AVM's with a mean In(D)/In(BP) ration of 0.71 +/- 0.36 (+/- standard deviation). Seven of these AVM's were available for pathological study and all of them demonstrated evidence of arterial thrombosis of variable age. In the remaining 12 patients, the In(D)/In(BP) ratio was not significantly elevated (mean 0.02 +/- 0.13), indicating the absence of active platelet aggregation during this short interval of study. Five of these AVM's were pathologically examined, four of which showed evidence of arterial occlusion. It is concluded that platelet aggregation is a common occurrence in cerebral AVM's and may account for the dynamic histopathology often seen in these lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral and simultaneous sampling of the inferior petrosal sinuses in patients with Cushing's disease has been used to establish the presence and laterality of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing microadenomas prior to transsphenoidal surgery. Successful preoperative lateralization depends upon equivalent dilution of pituitary venous blood on the two sides since samples which are diluted by unequal amounts of non-pituitary blood may lead to erroneous results. To assure valid sampling results, the use of other pituitary hormones, measured simultaneously, has been proposed to correct the ACTH concentrations from the inferior petrosal sinuses against unequal dilution by non-pituitary venous blood. This proposal presumes that ACTH-secreting microadenomas will not cause unequal delivery of the other pituitary hormones into the two inferior petrosal sinuses. The inferior petrosal sinus concentrations of prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH), and the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (alpha-HCG) were evaluated as indicators of pituitary venous blood dilution in 11 patients with Cushing's disease. Four patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome served as controls. Blood was withdrawn simultaneously from catheters in both inferior petrosal sinuses and from a peripheral vein for measurement of ACTH, PRL, TSH, and alpha-HCG. The ACTH concentrations were then corrected for dilution by non-pituitary blood by dividing the ACTH concentration from each side by the ratio of the inferior petrosal sinus to peripheral blood concentrations of PRL, TSH, and alpha-HCG for that side. At surgery, all 11 patients had ACTH-secreting microadenomas on the side predicted by the uncorrected ACTH concentrations. However, in three patients the corrected ACTH values would have led to erroneous results. Among the 18 sets of corrected inferior petrosal sinus measurements in these three patients, the corrected ACTH values failed to show an inferior petrosal sinus gradient in six and localized the tumor to the side opposite the adenoma in four. Incorrect lateralization was obtained with each of the hormones (PRL, TSH, and alpha-HCG) used for correction. Furthermore, the ipsilateral (side of tumor)-to-contralateral inferior petrosal sinus gradient of ACTH in patients with Cushing's disease was generally paralleled by a significant inferior petrosal sinus gradient of PRL, TSH, and alpha-HCG to the side of the tumor, whereas patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome tended not to exhibit lateralizing (side-to-side) gradients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the first type, localized spinal cord changes at the level of compression, consistent with myelomalacia, were revealed best with T2-weighted images as high-intensity spinal cord signals. In the second type, lesions consistent with either cystic necrosis or secondary syrinx were noted locally, and/or extending longitudinally up, and/or down inside the spinal cord. These latter lesions were best revealed as low-intensity signals on T1-weighted MR images and as a signal-void sign (moving fluid) on proton-density or T2-weighted MR images. It is suggested that segmental lesions at the level of the spondylotic bar represent early proton changes from pressure in and around the same zones that evolve into gray-matter enhancement regions shown as \"snake-eyes\" on delayed computerized tomography (CT) after myelography. The longitudinal lesions are thought to be the same pencil-shaped zones of cystic necrosis evolving into a secondary syrinx in the late stages (and usually found in the anterior portion of the dorsal columns during delayed CT after myelography). As spinal MR imaging continues to improve, these lesions will be demonstrated more clearly within the cord substance.\r"

  ".W": "The operative management of large and giant aneurysms is complicated by their typically atheromatous and thick walls, frequent intramural thrombosis with calcification, and broad-based necks that often incorporate perforating and other vital vessels. Not infrequently, it is necessary to at least focally arrest the intracranial circulation and open or excise these aneurysms to facilitate vascular reconstruction. This maneuver, in patients whose disease processes have destroyed autoregulatory function or who have inadequate sources of anatomical collateral supply, may cause the threshold for permanent ischemic injury to be exceeded. The authors have recently treated 14 such patients while under electroencephalographic monitoring to document electrical burst suppression induced by the administration of etomidate, followed by temporary clipping to permit vascular repair and intraoperative angiography to document patency of parent arteries. Up to 60 minutes of internal carotid artery occlusion, 35 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion, 19 minutes of upper basilar artery occlusion, and 4 1/2 minutes of lower basilar artery occlusion have been well tolerated using this protocol. In such situations, etomidate may be effective in protecting the cerebral circulation without the detrimental cardiotoxicity observed with protective doses of barbiturates.\r"

Six of the patients, who were followed for a mean period of 5.8 years, were cured, and symptoms recurred in two patients after 1 1/2 and 2 years.

The treated leptomeningeal cells had a significantly greater uptake of tritiated thymidine and grew faster than control leptomeningeal cells. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated a greater intensity of staining for procollagen type III in the cell layer of the treated cultures than in control cultures; diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography of the medium showed that the treated cells synthesized predominantly type III collagen, whereas control cells synthesized type I collagen. Analysis of the medulloblastoma-conditioned medium revealed that the soluble factor responsible for these effects in an acid- and heat-stable protein. The increased proliferation and altered collagen synthesis induced in leptomeningeal cell cultures by a soluble factor from a medulloblastoma are examples of how tumor and stromal elements interact, and may be related to the process of desmoplasia often observed in medulloblastomas in vivo.\r"

Brattleboro rats, which are deficient in arginine vasopressin (AVP), do not have acute vasospasm after SAH but exhibit a degree of late vasospasm that is not significantly different from that seen in Sprague-Dawley rats. Cisternal injection of AVP induced acute vasospasm in Sprague-Dawley rats with a duration similar to that seen after cisternal blood injection; however, at 2 days, the vessel diameter was normal. Intravenous AVP antagonist or intracisternal AVP antiserum administered prior to the SAH prevented the development of acute vasospasm without affecting the late phase. The data suggest that an increased release of AVP in the cerebrospinal fluid is involved in the development of acute cerebral vasospasm.\r"

The fibrinolytic activity was studied using a histochemical fibrin slide technique. A total of 59 adult male rats were studied. Twenty-nine rats were used for developing the intracerebral hematoma model via injection of autologous whole blood into the left frontal lobe; in the remaining 30 rats, the intracerebral hematomas were studied sequentially. Intracerebral hematoma formation was unsuccessful in six (21%) of 29 rats. Four rats died in the immediate postoperative period and two showed no intraparenchymal clot. Intense fibrinolytic activity was demonstrated in the blood vessel walls of the normal brain, especially in the meninges, choroid plexus, and ependymal cell layer. In the initial stages of hematoma resolution, fibrinolytic activity was not seen in the hematoma or parenchyma except in the preexisting blood vessels. However, 3 to 5 days later, fibrinolytic activity was observed in the capillary buds surrounding the hematoma and among the infiltrating mononuclear cells. This activity increased for 7 to 10 days following formation of the hematoma and decreased after 21 to 28 days. It is concluded that tissue fibrinolytic activity associated with newly formed blood vessels appears to be important in lysis of intracerebral hematomas.\r"

All diets also contained 1.0% cholesterol and 0.2% cholic acid. At the conclusion plasma and liver concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. All of the oat products significantly lowered plasma and liver cholesterol without depressing food intake or weight gain. As little as 4% dietary fiber in a processed oat flour significantly lowered cholesterol concentrations. Detailed fiber analysis of all of the oat fiber products revealed that processing increased the proportion of the total fiber that was soluble. The proportions recovered as total beta-glucans and total neutral sugars also increased, in part because the proportion recovered as Klason lignin decreased in all of the processed oat flours except the one prepared by a high pressure extrusion process.\r"

Six groups of male Buffalo rats were fed the following diets for 6 wk: a control diet containing recommended levels of beta-carotene and retinyl palmitate, a retinol diet containing 10 times the recommended level of retinyl palmitate, and a beta-carotene diet containing 10 times the recommended levels of beta-carotene and adequate levels of retinyl palmitate. Each vitamin combination was fed with either 5% (wt/wt) corn oil (low fat) or 20% corn oil (high fat). Plasma total beta-carotene levels were highest in the beta-carotene groups. Levels varied inversely with the level of fat in the control group and directly with fat in the beta-carotene group. Transport of beta-carotene appeared to parallel that of cholesterol in that 36 and 35%, respectively, were associated with the low density lipoprotein fraction. Accumulation of beta-carotene in the liver was apparent from the observation that levels in liver were much higher than those in plasma. Superoxide dismutase activity was much lower in the beta-carotene groups than in the retinol groups, irrespective of level of fat, and catalase activity was also lower in the beta-carotene group, but it was in proportion to the level of fat. These findings suggest that beta-carotene functions as an antioxidant in vivo.\r"

Plasma amino acid analysis revealed the presence of beta-leucine at a concentration of 60 to 80 mumol/l. After 425 d on a vitamin B-12-deficient diet, plasma beta-leucine was 133% higher (P less than 0.06) and plasma leucine and methionine lower (P less than 0.03) than values in plasma from hens fed a diet adequate in vitamin B-12. Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.42) (BCAT) activity was not enhanced by vitamin B-12 deprivation (P greater than 0.05). In contrast to leucine, beta-leucine was not utilized as substrate by BCAT for the formation of alpha-ketoisocaproate. Kidney extracts possessed leucine 2,3-aminomutase (EC 5.4.3.7) (LAM) activity, as evidenced by enhanced conversion of beta-leucine to alpha-leucine in the presence of adenosylcobalamin. LAM activity could not be demonstrated in liver or muscle extract, while leucine formation by pancreas extract was negligible. These data represent the first evidence of the presence of the amino acid beta-leucine in chicken plasma. In addition, the data support vitamin B-12-dependent leucine synthesis from beta-leucine in the chicken and highlight the kidney's role in leucine synthesis.\r"

In rat growth assays for available niacin, grains harvested at the immature, \"milky\" stage and then dried gave values of 88 and 74 micrograms/g, respectively. These values were in contrast to the low growth assay values of 18 and 16 micrograms/g for grain harvested at maturity, and even higher than the value of approximately 56 micrograms/g obtained for each immature corn in both the Association of Official Analytical Chemists procedure of chemical analysis and a standard microbiological procedure. However, when the milky grains were precooked at neutral pH, the values from these procedures were higher and agreed with the biological assay results. It is suggested that, during the initial alkaline digestion used for these two procedures, a proportion of the niacin in NAD, the major form of niacin in milky corn, degrades. However, when the materials are first cooked at neutral pH, nicotinamide is released without loss, and the pyridine ring is then stable. The traditional American Indian practice of roasting and drying \"green corn\" apparently provided a valuable source of niacin.\r"

PN-glucoside was found previously to constitute a major portion of the total vitamin B-6 in many foods of plant origin. Following a 14-d depletion period, rats were fed diets containing graded levels of either free pyridoxine (PN) or PN-glucoside for 17 d. Slope ratio analysis of dose-response curves, on the basis of growth and plasma pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) concentration, indicated 10-34% utilization of PN-glucoside relative to the molar response to PN. Erythrocyte aspartate amino-transferase (AspAT) activity and urinary 4-pyridoxic acid concentration were lower and the stimulation of AspAT activity by exogenous PLP was greater for rats fed PN-glucoside than for those fed PN, which indicated reduced vitamin B-6 nutriture in response to PN-glucoside. A constant 7-9% of the ingested PN-glucoside was detected in urine in intact form at all dosage levels. These results provide further evidence of incomplete bioavailability of PN-glucoside and indicate that its extent of utilization is not influenced by its level of dietary intake.\r"

Four-week-old, male chicks were assigned to one of four treatments: 5 mg Zn/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, 5 mg Zn/kg intravenous (i.v.) injection, 16 mg Zn oral (O) dose or a saline control (C). Chicks were fasted overnight, treated and killed 24 h later. 109Cd radioassay analysis of liver (L), kidney (K) and pancreas (P) showed a significant elevation of MT in all tissues except K of i.v. chicks. Comparing tissue MT accumulation within treatments showed that L was induced to a greater extent than P for the i.p. treatment (P/L ratio = 0.69 +/- 0.04), while the reverse effect was seen for both O (1.51 +/- 0.10) and i.v. (1.67 +/- 0.14) chicks, reflecting greater P than L accumulation. Zn injected i.p. did not result in significantly greater total peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) or macrophage (M) numbers than saline-injected controls. Sephadex, while causing massive increases in PEC and M, did not induce tissue MT, demonstrating the lack of correlation between PECs or Ms and MT accumulation. Feed intake by chicks during the 24-h period following i.p. Zn treatment was only 30% of that by controls. A subsequent experiment demonstrated that a similar restriction in feed intake increased L but not P MT. This increase accounted for 17.8% of the L induction due to i.p. Zn injection. This does not fully account for the reduction in P/L that is characteristic of i.p. treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "trans-Aconitic acid has been implicated in magnesium deficiency of ruminants since the 1960s, but recent experiments indicated that much of it can be converted by rumen bacteria to tricarballylic acid (TCBA). Rats were used as experimental models in the studies described here because analogous experiments in ruminants would have been very expensive. When TCBA was fed to young male Sprague-Dawley rats as 2% of an AIN-76A diet with marginal (200 mg/kg) or adequate (500 mg/kg) Mg, virtually all of the dietary acid was recovered in the urine. Mg and Ca absorptions were unaffected by TCBA but urinary losses of Mg, Ca and Zn were higher than in pair-fed controls. TCBA was highly correlated (r = 0.93) with titratable acid excretion, and Mg, Ca and Zn retentions were reduced by 90, 35 and 56%, respectively. Rats fed 2% citric acid, a structurally similar but metabolizable acid, excreted more Zn than controls but did not excrete excess Mg or Ca. Since TCBA led to a depletion of Mg and other cations, it could be a contributing factor in the etiology of the Mg deficiency known as grass tetany in ruminants. Additional work in ruminants now seems warranted.\r"

Overfeeding significantly increased carcass weight and fat for all ages examined. Carcass protein was significantly elevated in the overfed animals for the two youngest age groups. Differences between age groups in apparent energetic efficiency were small. Hepatic palmitate oxidation was depressed and esterification increased in all overfed rats.

  ".W": "To gain some insight into the nutritional factors that affect the blood level of transthyretin (TTR) and its metabolism, we have investigated the response of rat TTR to 1, 2 and 3 d of fasting and to 24 h of fasting followed by refeeding. The observed changes were compared to the level of TTR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to the amount of circulating thyroid hormones. Dot hybridization of a hepatic mRNA-cDNA probe specific for TTR was used to measure the relative level of TTR mRNA. Serum TTR decreased significantly after fasting and the decrease was proportional to the duration of the treatment. When rats were fasted for 24 h and then refed, serum TTR levels remained low after 2 d of refeeding. The dot hybridization results suggested that reduced liver synthesis was not the only mechanism that could explain this long-lasting effect of fasting. The TTR level in CSF was not influenced by fasting. In addition to the high sensitivity of serum TTR to food deprivation, the study also showed two distinct influences of fasting on the thyroid hormones: a primary effect that probably results in an inhibition of the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and a decreased T4-bound fraction, probably as a result of decreased serum level of TTR.\r"

Purified diets containing 5, 30 and 180 mg Zn/kg and 1, 6 and 36 mg Cu/kg were fed for 2 wk. Serum concentrations of copper and zinc were lower at the lowest intakes of either metal than at normal or supplemental levels. Kidney metallothionein levels were proportional to dietary zinc, being 50% less in the 5 mg Zn/kg group than in those fed the highest zinc intake. Metallothionein mRNA was measured by dot blot hybridization to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe representing the terminal 5' sequence of the metallothionein gene. In kidney the number of metallothionein mRNA molecules per cell increased four- to five-fold (from 4 to 29 molecules per cell) with increasing dietary zinc. A less pronounced effect on metallothionein mRNA was observed in response to dietary copper. At the lowest copper intake level and highest intake of zinc intestinal metallothionein mRNA was sevenfold greater than in any other group. Liver and brain did not respond appreciably to the dietary levels of copper and zinc that were fed. Chromatography showed that copper and zinc content of renal metallothionein was directly related to the dietary levels fed. In kidney, both metallothionein-1 and -2 genes were expressed.\r"

Treatments included 1) +Se (0.2 mg/kg diet) and 2) -Se (0.03 mg/kg diet). Calves were adapted to their assigned diets during an 84-d depletion period. By d 42 of the depletion period, whole-blood GSH-Px was lower for -Se calves than for +Se calves. Differences between treatments in plasma GSH-Px were observed by d 14. On d 84, Se-dependent GSH-Px activity in liver was higher in +Se calves. After depletion of -Se calves, animals in both treatments were intranasally inoculated with IBRV on d 0 and 35 of the 70-d challenge phase. Whole-blood and plasma GSH-Px increased after IBRV inoculation in +Se calves but not in Se-deficient calves. Serum IgM was higher for +Se calves throughout the challenge phase. Serum IgM increased in both treatments after primary IBRV inoculation but was unaffected by secondary challenge. Serum IgG was not affected by selenium status but increased in both treatments after secondary IBRV challenge. Serum IBRV antibody titers increased after inoculation on d 0 and 35. By d 49, IBRV antibody titers were higher for +Se calves than in Se-deficient calves. These results indicate that selenium deficiency may depress the immune response of calves challenged with a foreign pathogen.\r"

This article describes an educational program for internal medicine residents and its effects on ambulatory diabetes management practices. Forty-five of 86 residents practicing in the general medicine clinic of a university-affiliated city/county hospital were assigned randomly to receive a multifaceted program intended to 1) provide specific care recommendations, 2) teach necessary skills, and 3) make the professional and institutional environment more supportive. During the subsequent 11 months, 323 diabetic patients were interviewed and their records audited for evidence of changes in care. Experimental residents utilized fasting blood glucose determinations more often than controls (i.e., during 40% of visits vs. 31%, p = 0.004). Experimental residents also engaged more frequently in a variety of recommended dietary management recommendations. Isolated differences in monitoring/management of chronic complications also were found (e.g., lipid screening: 70% of experimental residents' patients vs. 58%, p = 0.016). Intensive, multifaceted programs of this nature are concluded to result in improvements in diabetes care, over and above that which is attainable through routine methods of clinical training for residents.\r"

Patient records from 341 admissions were reviewed to determine the relationship between chest x-ray results and postoperative chest complications. Patients who had major abnormalities had a 40% postoperative complication rate, compared with 9% for those with normal x-rays; but only 13% of the complications occurred in patients with major abnormalities. Nine patients had x-ray findings that led to clinical action: three with potentially beneficial management changes (congestive heart failure in 2, fibrosis in 1) and six with potentially detrimental clinical action (false diagnosis of tuberculosis in 2, false diagnosis of nodules in 2, falsely normal chest x-ray in 2). None of 50 surgical cancellations occurred as a result of an abnormal x-ray. All the beneficial effects attributable to preoperative chest x-rays accrued to patients who had clinical evidence of chest disease. The authors conclude that routine chest x-rays were not helpful in improving patient outcomes. They recommend ordering preoperative chest x-rays based on clinical indications so that the likelihood of false positives and false negatives and their associated detrimental effects can be minimized.\r"

Specific follow-up plans were made at the time of evaluation for 45 patients (42%). Survival data were obtained at 48-72 hours for 104 patients (97%) and at one month for 101 patients (94%). Fourteen patients (12%) were hospitalized within three days of their original emergency department visits, and three patients had documented acute myocardial infarctions. The only death within one month was that of a patient who died suddenly out-of-hospital later on the day of his emergency department visit. The authors conclude that patients who left against medical advice had presentations and prognoses that were in between those of patients for whom admission was not recommended and those of patients who consented to be admitted.\r"

The vast majority of internists (93%) settled in metropolitan areas, with 56% remaining in the San Francisco Bay Area, despite that region's already high concentration of physicians. Mean annual income, in 1984 dollars, was slightly more than figures from national surveys of physicians of similar age ($72,560 vs. $71,900), but reported mean work week was shorter (54.8 hours vs. 60.5). Although subspecialists earned significantly more than generalists, this was because they worked more hours. Those who graduated later were significantly less likely to be in private practice in 1985, mainly because they initially selected salaried institutional work more often than earlier graduates (p less than 0.001). Women worked 85% of the men's work week and subspecialized significantly less often (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that internists trained in already \"over-doctored\" areas will continue to settle there or in similar communities.\r"

Two hundred and sixty-eight interviews (156 in the experimental group and 112 in the control group) were included in the study.

The 185 graduates of the nine resident cohorts from 1974 through 1983 were surveyed; the overall response rate was 74%. Primary care careers have been chosen by 81% of PC graduates, compared with 38% of TD graduates (p less than 0.001); career satisfaction is equally high in the two groups. Among the PC graduates, 68% are practicing in high-need areas, compared with only 37% of TD graduates (p less than 0.001). PC graduates are more likely to make house calls, provide extended office hours, round in nursing homes or chronic care facilities, and co-practice with nurse practitioners or physician's assistants, and they are more active in women's health care, care of the terminally ill, and treating patients with sexual dysfunction (all p less than 0.05). PC graduates utilize various community agencies more frequently and supplement patient education with outside resources more intensively (p less than 0.001).

Resident physicians and patients were then interviewed about the rationale, benefit, risk, and alternative for each observed procedure. Commonly observed activities were injecting and giving oral medications, and performing invasive diagnostic procedures. Clinicians' communication involved rationale (43%) more often than benefits (34%), risks (14%), and alternatives (12%). Communication was similar when the procedures proposed were important and risky. Residents' and patients' interviews demonstrated limited congruence in shared understanding of rationale (57%), benefit (45%), risk (19%), and alternatives (25%).

Among the published studies on atopic eczema, the nine claiming a protective benefit of breast feeding performed less well than the 12 not making such a claim on \"methodologic\" standards relating to strict diagnostic criteria and blind ascertainment of outcome. The positive studies were somewhat stronger, however, on the \"biologic\" standards bearing on sufficient duration and exclusivity of breast feeding and on separate analysis of children at high risk. For the other atopic conditions, there were no important differences between positive and negative studies. In few negative or positive studies was there adequate control for confounding variables or examination of potential benefits relating to the severity or age at onset of atopic disease. To avoid another 50 years of unresolved controversy, future studies should improve both the biologic and methodologic aspects of their design and analysis.\r"

Group 2 received CSO to provide 55 kcal/kg/d (CSO-55) for 2 days and then CSO-110. Group 3 received only oral glucose-electrolyte solution (GES) for 2 days, CSO-55 for the next 2 days, and then CSO-110. Group 4 received the same diets as Group 3 except that only intravenous GES was used for the first 2 days. The GES maintenance solutions provided 24 to 30 kcal/kg/d. Therapeutic success rates were similar among dietary groups, ranging from 90% to 97%. Fecal excretion was initially lower in group 4 (P less than 0.05) but was similar initially among groups treated orally and among all four groups beginning on day 3. Net apparent absorption of nitrogen, fat, carbohydrate, and total energy; retention of nitrogen; and increments in body weight, arm circumference, and skin-fold thickness were positively related to the amounts of dietary energy consumed. Thus continued oral feeding with the CSO diets during the early phase of therapy yielded improved nutritional results.\r"

  ".W": "The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a 35-item screening questionnaire that is completed by parents and designed to help pediatricians in outpatient practice identify school-age children with difficulties in psychosocial functioning. The current study assessed the validity of the PSC by screening 300 children in two pediatric practices, a middle-class group practice and an urban health maintenance organization. Validity was established by comparing the results of PSC screening of 48 children with in-depth interview assessments and pediatricians' ratings. Results indicate that the PSC has a specificity of 0.68 and a sensitivity of 0.95. The screening process was well accepted by parents and pediatricians. Several children whose pediatricians' ratings had indicated adequate functioning were identified by the PSC as having substantial psychosocial dysfunction and requiring further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Groups of children with wheezing during respiratory illness, children without wheezing during respiratory illness, and appropriately matched healthy children were tested for the presence and concentration of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in nasopharyngeal secretions, employing the techniques of reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Although most wheezing children had LTC4 in nasopharyngeal secretions, the concentration of LTC4 among wheezing children who shed respiratory viruses was found to be consistently elevated (mean 1520 +/- 228 pg/0.1 mL) compared with values in wheezing children without evidence of viral infection (mean 709 +/- 147 pg/0.1 mL). In sharp contrast, little or no LTC4 activity was detected in healthy children (mean 106 +/- 77 pg/0.1 mL). These observations suggest that respiratory viruses are stimuli for the release of mediators of inflammation such as LTC4. Thus development of virus-induced bronchospasm may be related in part to direct mucosal cell-virus interaction and the release of pharmacologically active mediators in the respiratory tract.\r"

Data were obtained on 151 of 185 children (70 girls and 81 boys). Their ages ranged from 7 years 6 months to 12 years 9 months. All subjects were divided into groups by gender and body surface area (BSA). Maximum heart rates were greater in girls. The mean difference between maximum and recovery heart rates differed significantly by gender, girls taking longer to recover than boys. Maximum oxygen consumption (measured in cubic centimeters per minute per kilogram body weight) did not differ in boys and girls. Ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) occurred when there was an isolated increase in the slope for ventilatory equivalent for oxygen consumption (VE/VO2) with no change in the slope for ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2) when both were plotted against time. Absolute oxygen consumption (VO2) at VAT increased with BSA in both sexes, and, when normalized to body size and expressed as a percent of VO2 maximum, no significant difference was observed between the sexes. These data may be used in the fitness evaluations of preadolescent children from North America.\r"

The hospital charts for all infants admitted to the well-baby nursery between January 1 and December 31, 1985, were reviewed. Fifty-two (3.0%) of the 1714 infants who were discharged moderately early and 17 (2.7%) of the 622 infants who had an extended hospitalization were readmitted to the hospital by age 6 weeks (P = NS). Maternal age, financial status, and race each failed to predict infant readmission. Only four of the 52 readmission diagnoses among infants discharged moderately early could potentially have been identified (not prevented) before discharge with an extended newborn hospitalization. These data indicate that moderately early neonatal hospital discharge does not result in an increased incidence of rehospitalization within the first 6 weeks of life.\r"

The mean zinc concentrations of the diets in groups 1 and 2 were 2.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L and 8.4 +/- 0.8 mg/L, respectively, and the mean copper concentration of the diets in both groups was 0.45 +/- 0.12 mg/L. The studies were performed 7 to 128 days after birth, which corresponded to 29 to 43 weeks postconceptional age. The turning point of zinc balance from negative to positive appeared to be greatly influenced by the postconceptional age, being approximately 36 weeks in both group 1 and group 2, rather than other factors such as the zinc intake and the postnatal age. The calculated minimal requirement of dietary zinc during the period from 36 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, for an adequate amount of zinc retention in infants (250 micrograms/kg/d), was 0.8 mg/kg/d. Zinc supplementation did not appear to interfere with copper retention.\r"

The infusion of this product was well tolerated. Modest changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total hemolytic complement occurred as expected. Hepatic toxic effects were not detected. Mean peak IgG concentrations were 1564 and 1316 mg/dL for the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively. Mean IgG concentrations were very similar for both groups on postinfusion days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. IgG concentrations remained above 300 mg/dL in seven of 10 infants in each group by day 21, and in six of the high-dose group and seven of the low-dose group by day 28. Mean elimination half-lives were 22.6 and 22.8 days in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively. These data provide a basis for assessment of potential efficacy of IGIV in the prevention of late-onset infection in VLBW neonates.\r"

Ceftriaxone and cefoperazone have been shown to affect bilirubin-albumin binding. In this study, 13 additional cephalosporins were tested. Cefonicid, cefotetan, and cefmetazole competed with bilirubin for albumin binding and, at reported mean peak serum levels, decreased the reserve albumin concentration by 75%, 56%, and 40%, respectively. We suggest that these five cephalosporins may increase the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in jaundiced neonates.\r"

Intervention was directed at 10 of the residents; the other 10 served as controls. Between five and 12 charts were reviewed for each of the 10 residents in the intervention group; the scoring sheet, scoring criteria, results, and a brief discussion of potentially relevant occupational concerns for the given patient were returned to the resident, along with copies of the relevant pages of the patient's record. Chart review showed no difference in total scores for occupational history-taking between the two groups before intervention. The postintervention scores improved insignificantly for the intervention group; however, the scores deteriorated significantly for the control group (1.38 to 0.92, .05 greater than p greater than .025).\r"

  ".W": "Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death in the United States for the larger part of this century. Increases in smoking prevalence from the 1900s through the 1950s have resulted in more than 100,000 deaths annually. Because of the changes during the last three decades in smoking prevalence, the decreasing tar content of cigarettes, and the increasing popularity of low-tar cigarettes, trends in lung cancer are difficult to predict. This article presents an analysis of smoking and lung cancer data using an age-period-cohort model for projecting lung cancer mortality through the year 2025. The projections are based on the initial parameterization of the model and on prevention objectives related to smoking behavior established by the National Cancer Institute. It is concluded that the recent trends in lung cancer are unlikely to be affected by changes in cigarette composition and consumption in the near term, but increasing the effectiveness of anti-smoking campaigns can have a considerable effect on lung cancer rates in the more distant future.\r"

When treatment was evaluated by laboratory criteria (i.e., tumor growth inhibition in comparison to vehicle-treated, size-matched controls), all six of the drugs tested were judged to be active. However, when the criteria for positive drug activity consisted of the attainment of tumor regressions of greater than or equal to 50% in greater than or equal to 20% of the treated individuals (i.e., analogous to clinical criteria), only the three drugs that are known to be active against human breast cancer (PAM, CTX, and FUra) were judged active against the spontaneous murine breast tumors. PALA, ara-C, and TG failed to demonstrate regressing activity against the spontaneous murine breast tumors. With a caveat concerning the limited spectrum of drugs evaluated in this study, it can be concluded that the CD8F1 breast tumor model demonstrated 100% correlation with human breast cancer in terms of both positive and negative drug sensitivity when the criteria for evaluation were parallel.\r"

A comparison study of the effects of PDT on human xenograft amelanotic and melanotic malignant melanoma in the athymic nude mouse model was performed. Twenty-four hours after ip administration of Photofrin II, the responses to total laser light doses of 25-300 J/cm2 were evaluated by histologic examination. Animals were also sacrificed 24 hours after administration of Photofrin II without light, and their uptake and localization of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) for each tumor were measured and compared. The results indicate that human xenograft melanotic melanoma, despite the fact that it contains more HpD than does amelanotic melanoma, is far less responsive to PDT. This result appears to be due to the competing chromophore melanin, which may inhibit the photochemical reaction at several key points.\r"

In 52 trauma victims, grouped according to blood ethanol concentrations, we found there was a significantly higher mean plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration in heavy imbibers than in those with no detectable blood ethanol (790 +/- 84 pg/ml vs. 1,260 +/- 310; p = 0.02). To control confounding variables such as intensity of pain, injury severity, etc., we selected blood loss (0.9% body weight over 15 min), as an aspect of trauma to study in six normal subjects before and after ingestion of 6 oz and 10 oz of 86-proof liquor on successive days. As expected, the increase in plasma NE upon assumption of an upright position was accentuated by blood loss, (384 +/- 43 pg/ml prebleed; 694 +/- 16 post-bleed; p = 0.001). The postural or hypovolemic effect on plasma NE was enhanced by ingestion of ethanol at 6 oz prebleed (529 +/- 42 pg/ml pre-ethanol vs. 732 +/- 64 post ethanol; p = 0.02) or at 10 oz post-bleed (694 +/- 16 pg/ml vs. 1,154 +/- 166; p = 0.04). There was an approximate dose-response effect of ethanol on plasma NE under all conditions; for example, post-bleeding upright NE: 717 +/- 57, no ethanol; 1,045 +/- 221, 6 oz ethanol, and 1,257 +/- 182, 10 oz ethanol. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significantly affected by positional changes, blood loss, or ethanol consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Suicidal or homicidal throat slashes involving this area may produce serious horizontal laryngeal injuries, whereas homicidal stab wounds may produce serious vertical laryngeal or hypopharyngeal injuries. The extent of such injuries often cannot be predicted from the entrance wounds and presenting symptoms. Therefore special guidelines should be followed to insure the safety of selective exploration of knife wounds penetrating into the airspaces within this trapezium. In addition, repair of serious laryngeal injuries may require use of laryngoplasty or partial laryngectomy techniques rather than simple repair.\r"

Drill hole fractures and divot fractures complicated by fracture line extension required a weight bearing cast or functional brace while healing. The chip fracture and uncomplicated divot fractures were managed symptomatically. Chip, drill hole, and divot fractures followed a benign course and healed by formation of cortical bone along the defect rim.\r"

The remaining 37 patients underwent diagnostic peritoneal lavage using a closed technique before exploratory laparotomy. Using 10,000 RBC/mm3 as our previously established criterion for peritoneal penetration, there were seven true positive, one false positive, 28 true negative, and one false negative lavage for an overall accuracy of 94.6% with 87.5% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity as determined by subsequent laparotomy. While 33% of this patient cohort were found to have significant injuries (four had isolated diaphragmatic injuries, all detected by peritoneal lavage), 67% were subjected to negative surgical exploration, as accurately predicted by peritoneal lavage. Negative laparotomy carried a 10.7% operative morbidity. Based on these data we advocate diagnostic peritoneal lavage in patients with thoraco-abdominal penetrating trauma who otherwise lack operative indications.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) has led to greater efforts to conserve splenic tissue in patients sustaining blunt torso trauma. Nonoperative management of splenic trauma has emerged as a means to enhance splenic salvage yet criteria to assure the safety of such an approach remain ill defined and controversial. Since severity of injury directly influences outcome, a need exists for identification of splenic injuries that require early operation and repair or removal. Using our recently reported classification of splenic trauma, 46 patients with blunt splenic trauma were evaluated preoperatively with computed tomography (CT). Injuries were graded I through IV and were described as capsular or subcapsular disruptions without parenchymal injury (four); capsular and parenchymal injuries not involving the major vessels or hilum (24); injuries involving major vessels and/or the hilum (17); and fragmentation/devascularizing injuries (one). Additional modifiers were added for associated intra-abdominal and/or extra-abdominal injuries. Sixteen patients had their splenic injuries managed nonoperatively and the remainder underwent operation for the splenic injury or associated injuries. The CT classification was confirmed in all patients and we believe early operation optimized splenic salvage. We conclude that: 1) CT is an accurate technique to determine the extent of splenic injury; 2) CT classification of splenic trauma has a high correlation with anatomic findings and need for operation; 3) early operation in patients with severe class II and all class III injuries affords optimal conditions for splenic salvage; and 4) early definitive management of splenic trauma significantly reduces late splenectomy and shortens hospitalization.\r"

Using a grading scale of one to four from minimal to severe envenomation, 54% were grade I, 29% grade II, 7% grade III, 6% grade IV, and 4% were not graded because the patients were seen more than 12 hours after envenomation and not evaluated by other physicians. Five patients received one dose (10 cc) of crotalid antivenin each before transfer to our Emergency Center. All patients were treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, immobilization of the injured part, and elevation of the extremity to the level of the heart. No patients received antivenin or excisional therapy at this institution and one minor digital fasciotomy was performed. There were no deaths or amputations in this series. Eight patients developed superficial necrosis of the skin but only one required a skin graft. Three patients developed hematologic abnormalities and were treated with either platelet transfusions or fresh-frozen plasma. One patient required dopamine for hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. This experience supports a conservative approach to venomous snakebites and raises the question about the need to utilize traditional therapy for snakebites caused by species seen in our locality.\r"

A significant relationship was also found to exist between the Halstead Impairment Index and employment status of the study group.

Of the complications identified, spinal fracture, pupillary dysfunction, and intracranial pressure elevation were consistently associated with an impaired performance on the neuropsychological testing.

  ".W": "The incidence, diagnosis, and impact on surgical management of myocardial contusion (MC) are incompletely defined. During a 12-month period, all patients admitted to a Level I trauma center with blunt trauma were prospectively evaluated for MC (n = 1,110). Those with anterior chest wall contusions, sternal or anterior rib fractures, or pain/tenderness of the anterior chest (n = 140, 13%) underwent immediate and daily ECG, and CPK isoenzymes were measured at admission and every 6 hours in the first 24 hours. Eighty-nine of these patients underwent gated ventricular angiography (GVA) and 66 underwent two-dimensional echocardiography (2D ECHO). MC was considered present if either: 1) CPK-MB was greater than or equal to 5% of total CPK, or 2) an abnormal admission ECG reverted to normal before patient discharge. Fifty-six patients (5% of admissions, 40% of those with apparent chest trauma) were positive by one or both criteria. Thirty patients (54%) were positive by CPK alone, 23 (41%) by both CPK and ECG, and three (5%) by ECG alone. Of the 53 with elevated CPK-MB, 14 (26%) were normal on admission with the remainder becoming elevated in the first 24 hours. 2D ECHO was abnormal in only three of 21 positive patients (14%), and GVA was abnormal in only three of 40 positive patients (7%). Surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia were performed in 37 (66%) of the positive patients. No significant arrhythmias developed under general anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of serum CPK-MB assays in the diagnosis of myocardial contusion, we reviewed the hospital records of 182 patients with significant blunt chest trauma and serial CPK-MB determinations. In our laboratory a serum CPK-MB/CPK ratio less than 2.2% is abnormal. The study group was composed of 131 men and 51 women, with a mean age of 35 years. Only six patients had histories of cardiac disease. Of 159 patients injured in vehicular accidents, 143 were drivers, nine were pedestrians, and seven were passengers. There was no relationship between the MB fraction and soft (nonspecific changes) or strongly suggestive (ectopy, focal changes) ECG signs of myocardial contusion. Two of the three patients with power failure had CPK-MB/CPK ratios less than 2.2%. MUGA scans, performed in 18 patients, indicated myocardial injury in seven patients; only 1/7 had abnormal 2D echocardiography, and only 2/7 had elevated MB fractions. In summary, we found no relationship between serum CPK-MB and the presence of clinically significant myocardial contusion. CPK-MB determination in patients with suspected blunt myocardial injury is unjustifiably expensive ($108/assay) and adds confusion to an already vague clinical area.\r"

To simplify use of this scale for Injury Severity Scoring in clinical practice, two 8 1/2\" x 11\" charts, which can be included in the patient record, have been developed from the AIS dictionary. Separate charts apply to blunt and penetrating trauma. Previous experience with a condensed AIS chart (CAIS) using the 1980 revision of the dictionary suggests that such edited revisions can result in accurate injury scaling in more than 95% of patients presenting to a Level I Trauma Center. The availability of such charts assists in calculation of the ISS soon after admission, which may prove to be a valuable teaching tool and useful in resource allocation, audit, and assessment for prospective payment.\r"

Although the rates of pedestrian injuries are higher in urban areas, the pedestrian fatality rate in rural areas is higher for nearly all age groups, and at all posted speeds. Multiple logistic regression was carried out to measure the risk of dying once involved in a pedestrian-vehicle collision in rural areas compared to the risk for urban areas. This relative risk was seen to be elevated (RR = 2.3; 95% CI = 2.0-2.6) even after controlling for the effects of age and sex of the pedestrian, and posted speed of the vehicle. When explored further it was seen that a larger proportion of fatalities died out of the hospital and within the first hour after injury in rural areas than in urban areas. It is possible that Emergency Medical Services care is less rapidly available and that accessibility to trauma centers is more limited in rural areas.\r"

Damage to the lungs with resultant respiratory insufficiency and arterial embolization of air from alveolar pulmonary venous fistulae is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality following high-level blast exposure. In an effort to generate a widely applicable damage-risk criterion for thoracic injury from blast we are developing a complex computer finite element model (FEM) of the thorax. Taking an engineering approach, a horizontal cross-section of the thorax is divided into small discrete units (finite elements) of homogeneous structure. The necessary physical properties (density, bulk modulus, etc.) are then determined for each element. Specifying the material constants and geometry of the elements, the computer can load the surface of the structure with some force-time function (blast pressure-time history) and calculate the resultant physical events such as displacement, compression, stress, strain, etc. Computer predictions of pressure wave phenomena in the lung parenchyma are compared with trans-bronchially measured pressures in blast-exposed animals. The model should prove useful in assessing the risk of blast injury in diverse overpressure environments and may give insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms and strategies for protection.\r"

The live animals were surgically evaluated, and then sacrificed. Blocks of soft soap were subjected to equal tests and the behind-armour indentations were measured. The results indicate that serious injury to the body armour-protected chest may be caused by the impact of nonpenetrating bullets and shotgun pellets. Severe pulmonary contusions and lacerations were found when the energy transferred through the body armour was estimated to be high.\r"

  ".W": "Ballistic wounds have been and will remain the principal cause of casualties in combat. Cloth ballistic vests (CBV) play an important role in limiting critical wounds from fragments and small-arms fire. There is an increased risk of primary blast injury on the modern battlefield. In a previous study, volunteers were exposed to short-duration blast waves of low peak pressure (18.6 +/- 0.8 kPa). Pressure measurements made in the distal esophagus as an estimate of intrathoracic pressure (ITP) were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) when the standard U.S. Army ballistic jacket was worn (8.7 +/- 1.2 kPa) than when fatigues alone were worn (7.4 +/- 0.7 kPa). In this study 58 sheep were exposed to nominal blast levels of 115, 230, 295, and 420 kPa peak pressure in groups of 12, 18, 16, and 12, respectively. Half of each group was fitted with a CBV. Lung weight index (LWI), lung weight expressed as a percentage of body weight, was used as a measure of blast injury. Use of the CBV was associated with a significant increase in LWI (p less than 0.05) which averaged 21% for the two middle exposure groups. At the 420 kPa level, two of six non-CBV animals died as opposed to five of six animals wearing the CBV. Intrathoracic pressure was generally higher in the CBV group. Likely mechanisms of injury enhancement include an increase in target surface area and an alteration of the effective loading function on the thorax. This information may be useful in the triage and treatment of casualties exposed to intense blast environments.\r"

All 15 antipersonnel mine fatalities suffered extremity amputation. Seven of the 15 patients suffered immediately fatal head, neck, or truncal injuries (Type I injury). The three patients who underwent hospital resuscitation had extremity amputation but were spared major head, neck, or truncal injury. It is in this group of injured that potentially salvageable patients can be identified; for them aggressive rescue and resuscitation must be performed. Those with Type II injuries are the highest priority in any triage plan. In a mass casualty or combat casualty scenario, Type II patients, in particular those with high bilateral above-the-knee amputations, may be reassigned to an expectant treatment category so as to allow the main focus on more salvageable patients. The prehospital management plan emphasizes rapid assessment and triage of patients, use of tourniquets to control extremity hemorrhage, supplemental oxygen or endotracheal intubation if possible, neck immobilization, use of the extremity section of the pneumatic antishock garment if applicable, and rapid transport to a hospital. Hospital management of these patients emphasizes aggressive resuscitation, early endotracheal intubation, and rapid volume replacement with simultaneous balanced salt solution and blood. Operative debridement with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and tetanus prophylaxis is performed; wounds are managed in an open fashion and frequently examined at subsequent dates in the operating room.\r"

Volume of the infused fluid exceeded threefold the volume of lost blood. During and after fluid replacement blood samples were drawn for biochemical investigations and haemodynamic disturbances were carefully observed. In conclusion, we can say that Ringer's solution filled the vascular bed and improved tissue perfusion, but it failed to correct metabolic and acid-base equilibrium disturbances to such a degree and for as long a long time as did Ringer's solution with lactate.\r"

Such areas may occur at some distance from the missile track. Tissue responses to oxygen lack can be monitored by observing changes in intrinsic cellular fluorescence. The blue autofluorescence of intracellular pyridine nucleotides increases with anoxia, whereas the green autofluorescence of intracellular flavoprotein has been found to decrease with anoxia. We have developed a scanning fluorometer which rapidly provides an image of the distribution of anoxic areas in soft tissues. In experiments with anaesthetized rabbits, occlusion of the blood vessels to the gracilis muscle caused an increase in its pyridine nucleotide fluorescence and a decrease in its flavoprotein fluorescence. The changes were hastened by stimulation of the muscle to fatigue. Arterial infusion of colloidal carbon confirmed that adjacent muscles still had a blood flow. The apparatus has potential for the identification of hypoxic zones peripheral to the permanent wound cavity. Conversely, it may also help to indicate whether vascular repair after trauma of large blood vessels has led to improvement of the metabolic status of tissue being reperfused.\r"

The mechanism behind the effects observed is not yet known, nor can the absence of EEG effects in some animals be explained at present. Further studies of the remote cerebral effects of high-energy missile trauma should be carried out.\r"

The entire missile path is captured in one or more 25 X 25 X 50 cm blocks of 10% ordnance gelatin at 4 degrees C. The penetration depth, projectile deformation and fragmentation pattern, yaw, and temporary cavity of the missile in living anesthetized swine muscle are reproduced by this gelatin. Measurements are taken from cut sections of the blocks after mapping of the fragmentation pattern with biplanar X-rays. These data are then reproduced on a life-sized wound profile which includes a scale to facilitate measurement of tissue disruption dimensions, a drawing of the loaded cartridge case before firing, the bullet weight and morphology before and after firing (and calculated percent of fragmentation), and the striking velocity. This technique allows us to determine the wounding character of the projectile without the need for elaborate and expensive high-speed cine and X-ray equipment, or the need for shooting live animals. The method improves our understanding of the wounding process and should lay the groundwork to assure more rational and effective treatment.\r"

The mean concentration at 6 hours after injury was still higher than that before injury (p less than 0.05). Even though the severities of the injuries varied rather much there was a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between the plasma cortisol concentrations at 1 hour of the two groups into which the dogs were divided according to the severity of their injuries. The changes of the plasma cortisol concentrations may be parallel with the extent of the injuries and there was a positive correlation with the dimensions of the entrance wounds.\r"

Infusion of purified human tissue thromboplastin in animals resulted in an intravascular coagulation and respiratory insufficiency. This could be inhibited by previous infusion of phospholipase C (PLC) from Bacillus cereus. We have studied the effects of PLC infusion on the course of post-traumatic pulmonary microembolism, induced by a high-energy (c. 700 J) missile trauma to the hind legs of pigs. The trauma resulted in a major muscular injury and an indirect femoral fracture. Untreated pigs developed intrapulmonary microemboli. The degree of microembolism in the lungs was measured quantitatively by external detection over the right lung of radiolabeled platelets and fibrin. Infusion of 80 micrograms PLC/kg/hour resulted in an accumulation of blood PLC associated with toxic reaction leading to increasing tachycardia and circulatory collapse after 10 hours. PLC infusion of 20 micrograms/kg/hour did not inhibit the pulmonary microembolism. A PLC-dose in between, viz. 40-50 micrograms/kg/hour, proved to efficiently inhibit most of the microembolism during the infusion period. Cessation of PLC infusion after 24 hours was accompanied by a later increase in pulmonary trapping of platelets and fibrin and decreases in paO2. Concomitantly there were opacities seen on chest X-rays. The results show that tissue thromboplastin is an important etiologic factor in post-traumatic pulmonary microembolism and that inhibition with phospholipase C can be of value in the prophylaxis of the syndrome.\r"

The following conclusions about the effects of the wounding factors, such as energy transfer, velocity, mass, and shape of fragment are presented: 1) For given target characteristics, the important wounding factors of fragments are impact velocity, mass, and shape, and of these velocity is the most important. 2) Besides direct effects, the fragment velocity has great influence on far-reaching, indirect wounding effects. When velocity increases, it not only increases the size of direct wound, but also the rate of indirect bone fracture. 3) The rate of energy transfer is affected by fragment shape, and it is also a decreasing function of mass. 4) Under the same conditions there are differences in wounding effectiveness among the four fragment shapes, the triangular with a comparatively high wounding effectiveness, followed by the square, cylindrical, and spherical. The types of wound channels are also different, the cylindrical and spherical making a \"through\" type, the square and triangular making a \"blind-tube\" type.\r"

The most pronounced wound characteristic for the spherical fragments was that the entrances were larger than the exits; the higher the striking velocity, the larger the size of the wound. The skin near the entrance tended to be torn away when the striking velocity was above 1,200 m/s. As a general rule, most exits appeared to be circular with a diameter slightly bigger than that of the fragment. Shapes of the wound channels were conic in general. The channel volumes were proportional to the striking velocities of the fragments; in the case of two spheres having the same striking energy, the small one would produce larger volume of wound channel and amount of debrided tissues. The energy release rate for smaller fragments was higher than that for larger ones.\r"

Other studies have not dealt with projectiles in this velocity range; the conclusions and assumptions stated in this 1976 paper have been quoted by others and accepted as fact. In a previous study, we shot blunt fragments into gelatin, but our findings did not support the proposed hypothesis that temporary cavity shape in tissue changes at velocities above the sonic speed. The temporary cavity becomes larger with increasing velocity but it does not become shallow unless the projectile fragments on impact. In the present study, we shot a series of blunt projectiles into animal tissue at velocities of 764 to 2,049 m/s. The stellate skin and muscle disruption splits from temporary cavity stretch we observed in this study are not apparent on entrance wounds from individual explosive device fragments in the living wounded. We suggest, therefore, that studies using blunt projectiles at striking velocities above 700 m/s are lacking in clinical relevance. We also compared wounds produced by pointed projectiles with those produced by blunt projectiles. The marked difference in wound morphology showed the fallacy of doing a study with blunt missiles and applying conclusions from that study to tissue disruption caused by all projectiles.\r"

The volume of residual cavity in soap, the shape and sizes of live tissue wounds, and the mass of surgically debrided devitalized tissue were measured. The effects of the two projectiles at 7.7'' twist were found similar in soap; the SS 109 produced more tissue damage than the M 193 missile. Using the 12\" twist rifle, a significant increase in wounding capacity of SS 109 projectile was found. In conclusion, nonsignificant differences in local effects between the two projectiles using the 7.7'' twist rifles were found, and markedly increased effects of the SS 109--12'' system were ascribed to decreased essential stability and its earlier tumbling in penetrating a target. The soap as a live tissue simulant has proven its reliability in testing small-caliber arms.\r"

In all cases an internal deformation was discovered to have taken place: lead from the bullet's core flowed into the air space inside the bullet's tip. The roentgenograms also showed that this flow of lead resulted in an asymmetrical bullet in every case.

  ".W": "Soft-tissue wounds were inflicted on the upper parts of both hind legs of dogs by fragments which were shot with a smooth-bore testing rifle. Three impact velocities were used: \"high\" (1,500 m/s, six dogs), \"middle\" (1,000 m/s, eight dogs) and \"low\" (700 m/s, seven dogs). Debridement and gross examination were carried out 6 hours after wounding. The main conclusions were as follows: 1) Grossly, most of the wound tracks were blind. The primary wound track in the \"high\"-velocity group looked like a funnel in shape. The wound cavity close to the entrance had the largest diameter. 2) The severity of the tissue damage depended on the impact velocity. The higher the velocity, the larger were the wound cavities, the more tissues damaged, and the wider was the area of tissue damage around the cavity. 3) Based on the gross, light microscopy (LM), and electron microscopy (EM) observations it was found that one of the predominant characteristics of the tissue damage caused by fragments was the irregularity or unevenness. This was especially true in the case of the \"high\"-velocity group. The distribution of tissue damage seemed to be \"jumping\" or \"mosaic.\" This probably resulted from the irregularity of the energy delivery from fragments with high velocity and low mass. 4) The differences in morphologic characteristics between wound tracks caused by bullets and those by fragments are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The wounding effects of small fragments of the same weight (0.44 gm) but different shapes and at different impact velocities (708-1,560 m/s) on the soft tissues of the hind legs of 156 dogs were studied. The experiments showed that velocity was the major factor in causing wounds. For fragments of the same shape, the energy transmission, volume of wound cavity, sectional areas at entrance and exit, and amount of tissue that had to be excised increased rapidly with increasing velocity. In particular, as the velocity reached about 1,500 m/s, a shallow and wide wound tract was liable to occur, peripheral tissue lesion was relatively apparent, even extended to the whole leg, and the rate of occurrence of bone fracture was high. The wounding effect of the shape of the fragment closely related to its sectional specific weight (W) and drag coefficient (CD). Given the weight of the projectile and the density and thickness of the tissue, the energy transmission (delta E) was directly proportional to the square of the velocity and to the drag coefficient, and inversely proportional to the sectional specific weight of the fragment. Therefore, under certain conditions, reducing the sectional specific weight often increased the drag coefficient, in favour of causing a wound. In this experiment, the extent of wounds caused by the triangular, the square, and the cylindrical, and the spherical fragments decreased in that order, in agreement with their values of sectional specific weight and drag coefficient.\r"

Histologic and ultrastructural changes were observed in the contusion zone and the concussion zone at 6, 12, and 24 hr after wounding. Histologically, it was shown that at 6 hr after wounding, there were degeneration and necrosis of myofibers and interstitial hemorrhage and edema in the contusion zone, while some fibers still appeared to have normal structure in the outer layers. In the inner layers of the concussion zone close to the entrance, there was focal necrosis of myofibers. Histologic changes at 12 and 24 hr after wounding were similar to those at 6 hr but there were more inflammatory reactions. A considerable number of ultrastructural changes were seen in the contusion zone at 6 hr after wounding, such as loss of sarcomeres, vacuolization and pyknosis of mitochondria, swelling of sarcoplasmic reticulum, irregular arrangement of Z-lines, breaking of some capillary endothelial cells, etc. However, in the concussion zone, the changes were much less than those above mentioned, although karyons and karyomeres of some monocytes appeared to be gathering to the side of cytoblast. On the whole, the ultrastructural changes were not so severe at 12 and 24 hr as those at 6 hr after wounding. Also, the characteristic features of the wound caused by high-velocity steel bullets were not similar to those caused by 5.56-mm high-velocity missiles. The severity of damage at the entrance of wound track caused by steel bullet was more marked than that at the exit.\r"

  ".U": "88119243\r", 
  ".W": "Alkali therapy is used commonly to prevent recurrent stone formation in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis. We compared the effects of potassium citrate to those of sodium citrate in 6 well defined cases of incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. The patients were studied during a control phase, during potassium citrate treatment (80 mEq. per day) and during sodium citrate treatment (80 mEq. per day) chosen in random order. Potassium citrate caused a decrease in urinary calcium and a significant increase in urinary citrate that resulted in a significant decrease in the urinary saturation of calcium oxalate. It did not alter the saturation of brushite and sodium urate. However, while sodium citrate also was able to increase the urinary citrate level, there was no decrease in the urinary calcium (owing to the increased sodium load). Thus, the urinary saturation of calcium oxalate did not decrease as much as with potassium citrate and the saturation of brushite increased significantly. Moreover, the urinary saturation of sodium urate increased significantly owing to the enhanced sodium excretion. The results suggest that potassium citrate therapy may retard the crystallization of calcium oxalate and may not cause calcium phosphate crystallization. In contrast, sodium citrate may have no effect or it sometimes may accentuate the crystallization of calcium salts. Thus, our study supports the potential clinical advantage of potassium citrate therapy over sodium alkali treatment in patients with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis and recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis.\r"

There was a statistically significant difference between controls and patients with bladder outflow obstruction in each parameter: voiding time 28.2 +/- 9.3 versus 49.2 +/- 26.5 seconds, time to peak flow rate 13 +/- 4.1 versus 19 +/- 12.6 seconds, time to 50 per cent emptying 5.5 +/- 2.4 versus 25.7 +/- 26.9 seconds, average flow rate 9.1 +/- 3.7 versus 4 +/- 2.3 ml. per second, peak flow rate 19.6 +/- 7.6 versus 8.8 +/- 4.1 ml. per second, corrected peak flow rate 1.22 +/- 0.32 versus 0.59 +/- 0.22, ejection fraction 95.3 +/- 3.5 versus 79.7 +/- 17.6, and residual urine 13.1 +/- 13.5 versus 74.1 +/- 135 ml., respectively. The corrected peak flow rate showed the best separation between controls and patients with obstruction. Of the controls 93 per cent had a corrected peak flow rate of 0.87 or greater compared to only 13 per cent of the patients with obstruction. This method involves a single noninvasive procedure that enables determination of voiding parameters related to urinary volume, flow and time, and it avoids the extra examination needed to determine the residual urine.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative fluorescence image analysis is a rapidly evolving biophysical cytochemical technology with the potential for multiple clinical and basic research applications. We report the application of this technique for bladder cancer detection and discuss its potential usefulness as an adjunct to methods used currently by urologists for the diagnosis and management of bladder cancer. Quantitative fluorescence image analysis is a cytological method that incorporates 2 diagnostic techniques, quantitation of nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid and morphometric analysis, in a single semiautomated system to facilitate the identification of rare events, that is individual cancer cells. When compared to routine cytopathology for detection of bladder cancer in symptomatic patients, quantitative fluorescence image analysis demonstrated greater sensitivity (76 versus 33 per cent) for the detection of low grade transitional cell carcinoma. The specificity of quantitative fluorescence image analysis in a small control group was 94 per cent and with the manual method for quantitation of absolute nuclear fluorescence intensity in the screening of high risk asymptomatic subjects the specificity was 96.7 per cent. The more familiar flow cytometry is another fluorescence technique for measurement of nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid. However, rather than identifying individual cancer cells, flow cytometry identifies cellular pattern distributions, that is the ratio of normal to abnormal cells. Numerous studies by others have shown that flow cytometry is a sensitive method to monitor patients with diagnosed urological disease. Based upon results in separate quantitative fluorescence image analysis and flow cytometry studies, it appears that these 2 fluorescence techniques may be complementary tools for urological screening, diagnosis and management, and that they also may be useful separately or in combination to elucidate the oncogenic process, determine the biological potential of tumors and monitor the results of chemopreventive, immunological and chemotherapeutic regimens. To our knowledge there has been no study in which quantitative fluorescence image analysis and flow cytometry were compared directly to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses for urinary tract cytology. Such a study could provide important information for urologists.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometry deoxyribonucleic acid measurements of bladder washings, routine bladder irrigation cytology and cystoscopic results were compared in a prospective fashion during 33 months of clinical urology practice. Of the 204 patients (286 specimens) studied 74 had bladder tumors or a history of bladder tumors and 130 had other genitourinary pathological conditions, including hematuria, cystitis, benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatic carcinoma. Flow cytometry and cytology agreed with the cystoscopic findings in 93 per cent of the cases, whereas flow cytometry agreed with cytology in 84.6 per cent. When combined, flow cytometry and cytology were negative in only 1 case when several papillomas or grade I papillary carcinomas were present on cystoscopy, yielding a diagnostic accuracy of 99 per cent. The false negative rates for flow cytometry and cytology were 4.3 and 5.2 per cent, respectively, with false positive rates of 4.2 and 3.1 per cent, respectively. As expected the specimens that were missed by cytology were low grade tumors and those missed by flow cytometry were usually ulcerated invasive tumors. We believe that flow cytometry is a valuable adjunct to cytology and cystoscopy in the diagnosis, management and followup of patients with known or suspected bladder cancer. In addition, criteria for the diagnosis of cancer are changed such that specimens with a deoxyribonucleic acid tail and a large amount of hyperdiploid cells without a distinct stem line are considered suspicious and indicative of bladder pathology but they are not synonymous with the presence of carcinoma.\r"

All patients with aneuploid histograms as predicted experienced recurrent disease. In 20 of 28 cases of recurrent disease the ploidy pattern changed during recurrence. Because of this finding we predicted disease progression if 2 or more histograms in the sequence were aneuploid. Two-thirds (8 of 12) of those having more than 1 aneuploid tumor incident experienced invasion, while only approximately a third (6 of 16) lacking repetitive aneuploidy had invasion. Furthermore, of the patients with 2 aneuploid lesions half had progression within 1 year and two-thirds within 2 years after the second aneuploid lesion. Therefore, it appears that in this disease deoxyribonucleic acid histograms can provide prognostic information beyond that obtained from tumor grade and stage.\r"

A total of 268 patients entered the study. Neither frequency of recurrences, tumor progression nor survival rate was improved significantly by the adjuvant treatment, so that only a limited number of patients will profit by instillation therapy. Analysis of previously reported data suggests that patients with superficial bladder tumors can be stratified into groups with appreciable differences in risk of progression. With regard to these results a differentiated use of a \"wait and see\" adjuvant intravesical therapy and more aggressive treatment after transurethral resection of superficial bladder tumors seems to be indicated rather than a general practice of chemoprophylaxis.\r"

Bulbomembranous urethral tumors had a higher incidence of abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns than penile urethral tumors (69 and 29 per cent, respectively). Of the tumors exhibiting a deoxyribonucleic acid diploid pattern and an abnormal (deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid or aneuploid) histogram 18 and 93 per cent, respectively, showed tumor progression (p less than 0.001). None (0 per cent) of the low grade (grade 1 or 2) tumors with a deoxyribonucleic acid diploid pattern developed local recurrence or distant metastases, whereas 90 per cent of the low grade tumors with an abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid pattern progressed (p less than 0.002). Patients with tumors exhibiting deoxyribonucleic acid diploid ploidy had 5 and 10-year rates free of disease of 85 per cent. In contrast, patients with tumors with abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns had 5 and 10-year rates of 20 and 0 per cent, respectively (p less than 0.001). Determination of deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern by flow cytometry provides important prognostic information for male patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the urethra.\r"

Cytological examination of urethral washings has proved to be a useful alternative to urethroscopy and urethrography. Urethral irrigation specimens also can be evaluated objectively by flow cytometry. In each of 4 patients in whom carcinoma developed in the urethral remnant analysis of urethral irrigation by flow cytometry was positive and comparable to results of urethral irrigation cytology. Flow cytometry is an objective and apparently reliable diagnostic test for malignancy in the urethral remnant.\r"

  ".W": "Testicular carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease are among the most frequent malignancies afflicting young men in the 15 to 39-year age group. These malignancies share other epidemiological characteristics as well, including multiple histological tumor types, higher rates of occurrence in white, urbanized populations and upper social classes, relative infrequency among black populations, low but definite familial occurrence and an early geographically acquired lifetime risk irrespective of later migration. Both diseases are increasing in this country. This epidemiological similarity suggests exposure to an infectious agent early in life. The Epstein-Barr virus is known to be oncogenic and neonatal exposure with early infection is believed to be associated with Burkitt's lymphoma in African children. High titers of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen also have been reported in a series of studies comparing patients with Hodgkin's disease and controls. Because testicular cancer is epidemiologically similar to Hodgkin's disease and, therefore, might be expected to manifest similar Epstein-Barr virus findings, we performed a viral screen (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis A and B viruses) on blood samples from 56 consecutive patients with clinical stage I germ cell tumors of the testis who had received no active therapy after orchiectomy. Our results show a high incidence (80 per cent) of previous exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and support the hypothesis of a possible infectious origin for testicular carcinoma.\r"

The over-all 5-year survival free of disease for these patients regardless of stage was 93.6 per cent. The 165 patients (69 per cent) with stage I disease had a 95.5 per cent 5-year survival free of disease that remained constant at 20 years. Stage II cancer was diagnosed clinically in 62 patients (26 per cent), while 13 (5 per cent) presented with more advanced (stages III and IV) disease. The 5-year survival rate free of disease for all patients with stage II cancer was 85 per cent. There were 14 pathological and patient characteristics analyzed, 4 of which were statistically significant. All but 1 of these factors (spermatic cord invasion) was related to tumor volume (stage, palpable mass and hydronephrosis). Based on the data of this retrospective review, the Canadian experience without prophylactic mediastinal irradiation and the development of effective chemotherapy, we recommend radiation therapy without prophylactic mediastinal irradiation for patients with stage I or IIA disease and chemotherapy for patients with stage IIB, III or IV disease. In an attempt to improve our results in the latter patients we recently instituted adjunctive radiotherapy for those with a persistent radiographic mass. Our current guidelines for the staging evaluation and followup of patients with this neoplasm also are discussed.\r"

When adenocarcinoma is adjacent to or even within the prostate containing benign hyperplasia, no metachromasia is seen around the benign acini.

Previous studies have measured changes in the 24-hour urine volume to evaluate the efficacy of fluid therapy in each patient. We used paper test strips to monitor urine pH and specific gravity in 22 of our stone clinic patients: 10 were instructed to increase water intake just before the study (group 1) and 12 were not so instructed (group 2). Mean specific gravities of 1.0222 (1.0238 corrected for pH) for group 1 and 1.0197 (1.0220 corrected for pH) for group 2 did not differ significantly. Urine specific gravities also were compared for 3 intervals: 1 to 9 a.m., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. Of the 22 patients 10 (3 from group 1 and 7 from group 2) had significant diurnal variations in the urine specific gravities, corrected and uncorrected, among these 3 periods. In addition, both groups had a significantly higher mean specific gravity from 1 to 9 a.m. (1.0234 uncorrected and 1.0248 corrected) than from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (1.0194 uncorrected and 1.0218 corrected). The 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. (mean of 1.0220 uncorrected and 1.0239 corrected) specific gravity did not differ significantly in either group. If 1.015 is the highest acceptable specific gravity of urine in stone patients, the findings suggest inadequate dilution of urine in these patients, whether or not they were instructed to increase water intake. Also, the significant diurnal variation in urine specific gravity would allow a nighttime triggering event at these hours of higher urine concentration.\r"

Spermatogonia were noted in all but the numbers were significantly reduced in those with the prune belly syndrome and posterior urethral valves compared to normals: 8.6 and 13.4 versus 31.2 per 10 high power fields, respectively. The fetuses with the prune belly syndrome also had marked Leydig cell hyperplasia in contrast to the other groups. These findings suggest that the testicular pathological condition in patients with the prune belly syndrome is caused by more than mechanical cryptorchidism.\r"

The calculus consisted of pure xanthine. Further investigations demonstrated low serum uric acid and absent urinary uric acid with increased excretion of xanthine. Eight months after nephrectomy blood pressure had decreased to normal. Her 5-year-old sister, who has beta-thalassemia, also has a low serum uric acid concentration and xanthinuria. The treatment of choice is to increase fluid intake so that the urine xanthine concentration remains below the level at which xanthine crystallizes. This may require adjustment of the urine pH.\r"
