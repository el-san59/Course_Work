  ".W": "One of the most interesting aspects of the pathogenesis of the allergic and pseudo-allergic reactions to drugs is the one concerning the possible roles of genetic factors, in general, and the relationship with atopy, in particular. We decided to study the correlation between the serum level of total IgE, the personal and familial history of atopy, and the allergologic tests (skin test, PRIST, RAST, etc) for one or more drugs taken by 465 patients with personal history of allergic reactions. From the data, we observed that the average amount of total IgE lies within the norm, 125.4 KU/L (+/- 209.2), without any significant difference between the allergic (132 KU/L) and the pseudo-allergic (121.8 KU/L) patients. The IgE levels tend to be higher in that part of the tested population which presented a circumstantial atopic status (11.8%) and they are not influenced by an allergic or pseudo-allergic reaction to drugs. According to these results, the relationship between drug hypersensitivity and atopy needs further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have suggested that the etiology of chronic urticaria/angioedema (greater than 6 weeks) can be identified 10% to 30% of the time while few reports have addressed the natural history of chronic urticaria/angioedema. An analysis of all patients referred to the authors' practice between 1983-1985 with a diagnosis of urticaria/angioedema was performed. Patients with hereditary angioedema were excluded. Eighty-six of the 214 patients had chronic urticaria/angioedema. In the remaining 128 cases of acute urticaria there were four exercise induced, nine contact, six cold induced, six drug induced, 11 food induced, one viral hepatitis associated, 29 with dermographism, and 62 undetermined. An etiology could not be determined in any of the patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema. Laboratory tests, including CBC, chemistry panel, urinalysis, ANA, rheumatoid factor, complement studies, sedimentation rate, and skin tests were all noninformative. Chronic angioedema without urticaria occurred in only nine cases, 31 cases had chronic urticaria alone, and 46 cases had both chronic urticaria and angioedema. Of the patients followed over the 3-year period, 27 resolved while 48 continued to have urticaria/angioedema. Response to medications was variable and will be discussed. Our study suggests that an etiology is determined in much less than 10% of patients with chronic urticaria; fortunately, 32% of our cases resolved over a 3-year period.\r"

The correlation coefficient between the total IgE and the RAST to D. farinae was 0.39 (P less than .05). There was no significant correlation between the total IgE and the RAST to D. pteronyssinus, Candida, dog epithelium, ragweed, Eucalyptus pollen, and Bermuda grass (P greater than .05). This indicates a low total serum IgE concentration does not exclude the possibility of significant elevation of specific IgE to a common allergen. Concordance for results of intradermal skin testing and RAST was high for most allergens. Lower efficiency for dog allergen and Candida suggests greater sensitivity of allergy skin testing for these allergens.\r"

The spontaneous histamine release varied from 19% to 36%. Anti-IgE caused an increase up to 26% until 65%. Incubation with allergenic food induced a histamine release from 41% to 81%, demonstrating positive results in 27 out of 30 separate experiments. Antigen-induced histamine release from biopsy specimens turned out superior to skin tests and specific IgE. It is the most reliable tool for diagnosis of gastrointestinal food allergy besides oral provocation.\r"

Thirteen percent of the 1120 patients had abnormal sinus images with the maxillary being the most involved cavity. A cloudy or opacified sinus was found in 43% of these cases. An increased signal to the epithelial lining was present in 44%. Intrasinus polyps were found in 27 paranasal sinus cavities (27 subjects). Furthermore, a seasonal pattern was evident for abnormal sinus scans. The months of July, August, September, and December had the highest frequency of abnormalities noted (greater than 16% of total scans done) whereas there was a low percentage (less than 8%) found during February and November. In summary, abnormalities of the paranasal sinuses occur frequently and vary with the time of year.\r"

The earliest possible time to treat is during the initial evaluation of the patient in the home or ambulance, which requires accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the prehospital setting. In our study, paramedics evaluated patients who had chest pain with a 12-lead ECG transmitted by cellular telephone and a checklist for inclusion and exclusion criteria for thrombolytic therapy. This information was transmitted to a hospital-based telemetry physician who diagnosed or excluded acute myocardial infarction and made a mock decision to withhold or administer a thrombolytic agent. Forty-eight patients with chest pain were evaluated. Six were diagnosed as having overt acute myocardial infarction by the hospital-based telemetry physician. All six patients had the diagnosis substantiated by both ECG and enzyme studies on hospital admission. Based on the data supplied by paramedics, two of these six patients were considered eligible for thrombolytic therapy by the physician. Hospital evaluation confirmed the prehospital decision to treat with a thrombolytic agent. In addition, all other patients were appropriately diagnosed as ineligible. Prehospital ECG diagnosis resulted in two patients going directly to the catheterization lab, thereby bypassing the emergency department. Overt acute myocardial infarction can be accurately identified by a prehospital-acquired 12-lead ECG transmitted to a hospital-based physician. Our study demonstrates that in conjunction with specially trained paramedics, the hospital physician can decide whether to administer thrombolytic therapy to such patients in the prehospital setting.\r"

The purposes of our study were to determine how frequently prehospital endotracheal intubation was used in pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests when a paramedic trained in endotracheal intubation was present, to determine the success rate and complications associated with the procedure in the field, and to compare resuscitation rates and outcome in patients with and without prehospital endotracheal intubation. Our retrospective study covered a 38-month period and included all prehospital victims of medical cardiopulmonary arrest under the age of 19 years. Data were collected from field assessment forms and validated by hospital charts, autopsy reports, coroner's reports, death certificates, and emergency medical services central dispatch logs. Of 63 victims of medical cardiorespiratory arrest, 42 had intubating paramedics present at the scene. Twenty-eight of 42 patients (66%) had endotracheal intubation attempted. Eighteen of 28 attempts (64%) were successful, associated with a major complication rate of 7% (two of 28) and a minor complication rate of 39% (11 of 28). In patients less than 1 year old, only six of 16 (38%) had endotracheal intubation attempted and only three of six (50%) attempts were successful. Of the 18 patients who were intubated successfully before arrival at the hospital, nine (50%) survived to hospital admission and one (6%) survived to discharge. The remainder died in the emergency department.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our study was limited to acute medical conditions in which protocols called for IV lines (124 patients with chest pain, 122 with acute respiratory distress, 99 with seizures, and only 25 with cardiac arrest) (the cardiac arrest cases were too few for statistical significance). We found that the difference in scene times for EMTs and EMT-Is not attempting IV lines was 6.1 and 6.9 minutes, respectively. The average scene time of EMT-Is attempting an IV line was 19.6 minutes (P less than .001) compared with EMT times, or times for EMT-Is not attempting an IV line. One hundred twenty-eight of 370 patients received IV medication within ten minutes of arrival in the emergency department, and ten of these patients had their IV lines initiated successfully in the field. Thirty-nine percent of patients with ED IV lines received IV medication within ten minutes of arrival, while only 21% of patients with a field IV line received medication in this period (P less than .05). We conclude that initiating a field IV line in this specific patient population significantly increased scene time and did not improve the chances of these patients receiving IV medication within ten minutes of arrival in the emergency department.\r"

Over a period of 29 months, 496 patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or both were seen in the ED of the Albuquerque Veterans Administration Medical Center. Of 868 visits in which patients were treated and released, 244 (28.1%) were followed by a relapse within 14 days. Those who relapsed had a slightly higher one-second forced expiratory volume at baseline than those who did not (50.1 +/- 22.2% versus 45.5 +/- 20.6% predicted, P = .054). For 94 patients (group 1), asthma was the exclusive clinical diagnosis, and all available pulmonary function tests showed a bronchodilator response. For 268 patients (group 2), COPD was the exclusive diagnosis, and all tests showed no bronchodilator response. One hundred thirty-four patients (group 3) were either diagnosed as having both disorders or had varying bronchodilator response on sequential testing. The risk of relapse for group 3 patients (35.6%) was higher than for those in groups 2 (23.1%, P less than .001) or 1 (19.7%, P = .001). The frequency of relapse was higher for nighttime than daytime visits (36.1% versus 24.5%, P = .006) and for weekend than weekday visits (33.6% versus 26.6%, P = .049).

Circulating neutrophils were depleted by administration of a neutrophil-specific sheep immune serum before a ten-minute cardiac arrest in ten experimental animals. Ischemic damage measured by a neurologic deficit score in these animals was compared with that in 12 animals that received either vehicle control or nonimmune sheep serum. Animals receiving immune serum averaged 89% depletion of neutrophils immediately after resuscitation (neutrophils +/- SEM: 703 +/- 123/mm3 after antiserum versus 6,384 +/- 1,171/mm3 before immune serum) and 70% depletion over the first three hours after resuscitation. Neurologic deficit scores assessed at one, two, six, 12, and 24 hours after arrest did not vary between depleted dogs and controls. Overall survival time in neutrophil-depleted dogs was less than in controls (15.5 +/- 1.3 versus 19.5 +/- 1.3 hours; P = .04). These results suggest that neutrophils may not contribute to clinically important central nervous system dysfunction after resuscitation from a ten-minute cardiac arrest.\r"

We reviewed the medical records of all patients less than 16 years old who received DPT in our ED during the 24-month period ending December 31, 1987. Of 487 patients who received DPT, the maximum dose was 50/25/25 mg, respectively. Wound repair (69%) and fracture reduction (12%) were the two most common indications. Lacerations most commonly involved the face (65%) or digits (20%). Efficacy was not directly reported, but only eight patients received repeat sedation. Head injuries and a lower mean initial meperidine dosage were more prevalent in patients requiring repeat sedation (P less than .05). Three patients (0.6%) experienced significant complications. All had respiratory depression and received IV naloxone. An abnormal initial mental status examination or an underlying neurologic abnormality was significantly associated with complications (P less than .05). DPT appears to be a safe and relatively effective sedative for selected pediatric ED patients when administered as a ratio of 2:1:1 mg/kg, respectively. Complications are increased in patients with acute or underlying neurologic abnormalities.\r"

Furthermore, diazepam treatment after cocaine exposure was also effective in decreasing deaths, from 80% to 21%, even when given after the onset of seizures. Although diazepam pretreatment was shown to prevent clinically overt seizures, cortical EEGs in these rats demonstrated a continuum of convulsantlike electrical activity. Our study points to the protective effects of diazepam when given before or after cocaine exposure. Together, these data suggest that diazepam has significant efficacy against cocaine intoxication even though it does not totally suppress cocaine-induced cortical EEG seizure activity.\r"

Twelve healthy male subjects fasted for eight hours before and four hours after a 20 mg/kg oral dose of aspirin. One hour after aspirin dosing, each subject received either no charcoal, 25 g Actidose-Aqua, or 25 g Super Char in a randomized crossover design. Each aspirin dose was separated from the previous dose by at least seven days. Total urine volumes were collected over 12-hour intervals, beginning 12 hours before the aspirin dose and continuing for 72 hours after dosing. Urine salicylate concentration was measured with a colorimetric assay. The fraction of aspirin dose recovered in the urine was 0.96 +/- 0.13, 0.78 +/- 0.18, and 0.50 +/- 0.20 for the control, Actidose-Aqua, and Super Char treatment phases, respectively. In vitro, Super Char was found to bind more salicylic acid than Actidose-Aqua at pH 8.1. We conclude that both activated charcoal preparations significantly reduced the gastrointestinal absorption of aspirin (P less than .05) and that Super Char was significantly more effective than Actidose-Aqua in reducing the gastrointestinal absorption of aspirin (P less than .01).\r"

The efficacy of this practice has never been established. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 149 head-injured patients having a Glasgow Coma Scale of 9 or less. One hundred six received FFP and were without evidence of coagulopathies, while 42 received no FFP or had coagulopathies. Group 1 received FFP within a time from injury (T1) and group 2 received FFP after time (T2) or not at all. Groups were similar in demographics, injuries, presenting Glasgow Coma Scale, and presenting hematologic parameters in serial pretreatment or posttreatment hematologic parameters (P less than .05). There were no differences between patients receiving \"early\" FFP, as compared with those receiving FFP later or not at all. The time of FFP administration did not appear to be critical for effective prophylaxis against coagulopathy.\r"

Three hundred urine specimens were subjected to Chemstrip 9 evaluations and full microscopic examinations in the microscopy laboratory. As the microscopy laboratory examination identified lower WBC and bacteria counts, increasing numbers of false-negative urine dipsticks results occurred. The results of our study reveal that the nitrite and leukocyte esterase assays miss significant microscopic findings with corresponding clinical pathology, with the nitrite examination being the less sensitive of the two tests. Based on our results, we believe it would not be prudent to use the Chemstrip 9 dipstick in the ED to exclude the presence of WBC and bacteria in the urine.\r"

Video endoscopy provided advantages in the following areas: 1) Technical. Superior quality of image with a significantly greater resolution. 2) Procedural. Multiple simultaneous viewers for teaching and increased coordination for therapeutic maneuvers. 3) Educational. \"Freeze frame\" capability for real time teaching; video taping for subsequent consultation, review, or teaching conference, video tape evaluation at preoperative conferences, and archive of video tape for teaching file. 4) Documentation. For use review and quality assurance or for patient education. 5) Research. Investigation of video image enhancement techniques. 6) Physical comfort. Relief of many causes of strain and fatigue and elimination of potential danger to the endoscopist in certain therapeutic maneuvers. Residents learned video and fiberoptic endoscopy equally well, requiring only 3 to 5 procedures to learn each type of system. Experience in this teaching program indicates a decided advantage to incorporating video endoscopy into surgical residency training. After more than 1000 video endoscopy procedures, the novelty has worn off but enthusiasm persists; the video system is now a workhorse that provides greater technical capabilities and broader educational horizons while returning endoscopy to the realm of surgical education.\r"

In the last two decades, the necessity of this examination became obvious but two surveys clearly indicated that despite the availability of instruments surgeons do not use it routinely. One of the reasons is the long learning curve and the limited experience. The introduction of the video choledochoscope opened a new chapter because the surgeon could learn it faster and the technique is easier to use. Choledochoscopy is a \"two man\" job, requiring four hands. Using video choledochoscopy, the assistant and the operator can observe the situation together, therefore coordination of movement is easier. The actual endoscopic procedure is faster and the location of the stone, its removal, and the sphincter function are recorded on tape. This is a great step forward in analyzing sphincter function. It became the method of choice in teaching. It is assumed that, with the introduction of video choledochoscopy, the incidence of missed stones will be decreased significantly.\r"

Half of the gastric tumors were hyperplastic and half were adenomatous. All the duodenal tumors were adenomatous, four being ampullary. The one symptomatic patient had intra-polypoid adenocarcinoma. There were no significant correlations between the endoscopic findings and patient age, sex, presence of colon cancer, or other extracolonic abnormalities. The authors affirm that gastroduodenal polyps are an important component of FPC and recommend that all patients with this condition undergo initial and follow-up gastroduodenoscopy. Multiple small lesions may be carefully monitored, but larger ones, particularly those in the region of the ampulla, must be excised.\r"

In Group 1, no problem was seen in the channel, and cholecystitis was found to be the cause. In Group 2, no problem was observed in ten (poor teeth and chewing), six experienced stasis or pill ulcerations, four had bezoars (fragmented or removed with basket), and two had intraluminal mesh. In Group 3, the scope floated through too large an outlet (greater than or equal to 13 mm) in eight, and no cause was seen in six (gorgers, sweets-eaters).

The authors report their experience with intraoperative biopsy in 37 patients in whom preoperative diagnosis was unsuccessful. Tru-cut needle biopsy was positive in 86 per cent of patients with carcinoma of the pancreas, but was negative in all patients having periampullary neoplasms. Incisional biopsy was positive in 75 per cent of all patients, its accuracy being approximately equal in both groups of patients. Duodenotomy with open biopsy was performed in eight patients having periampullary lesions and was accurate in 88 per cent. Biopsy of lymph nodes not contraindicating resection was performed in 11 patients and was positive in only 18 per cent. Resections based on clinical findings suspicious of malignancy with either a negative biopsy or no biopsy attempted resulted in a 13 percent resection rate of patients having benign disease. These results indicate that while histologic determination of malignancy can be obtained in most resectable pancreatic and periampullary lesions, at least 12 per cent of such tumors remain undiagnosed by standard operative biopsy techniques. Pancreatoduodenectomy should proceed in these patients based on their clinical status and the surgeon's degree of experience with the procedure.\r"

Two patients died, for an operative mortality of 11 per cent. One of the two patients had exsanguinating hemorrhage with profound shock on the way to the operating room; in the second patient, the aorta was occluded just beyond the disruption, and there had been no distal perfusion for several hours before operation. Four patients (22%), three of whom had not had a shunting procedure, had major neurologic complications relating to the spinal cord.

  ".W": "We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with Francisella philomiragia (formerly Yersinia philomiragia) isolated from normally sterile sites. Isolates from 14 patients were received by the Centers for Disease Control between 1975 and 1987: 9 were from blood; 2 from lung biopsies; and 1 each from pleural, peritoneal, and cerebrospinal fluid. Underlying problems included chronic granulomatous disease in 5 patients, near-drowning in 5, and a myeloproliferative disease in 2. All 13 patients for whom records were available had a febrile syndrome compatible with bacterial infection. Pneumonia and fever-bacteremia were the commonest clinical syndromes reported. In 7 cases, F. philomiragia was the only sterile-site isolate, and the clinical syndrome did not resolve without appropriate antibiotics. Familiarity with this organism is important because of its ability to cause serious disease in chronic granulomatous disease and near-drowning patients. Further study may yield new insights into pathogenic and host defense mechanisms.\r"

One of these techniques is the \"box plot,\" which is used to visually summarize and compare groups of data. The box plot uses the median, the approximate quartiles, and the lowest and highest data points to convey the level, spread, and symmetry of a distribution of data values. It can also be easily refined to identify outlier data values and can be easily constructed by hand. We apply box plots to tabular data from two recently published articles to show how readers can use box plots to improve the interpretation of data in complex tables. The box plot, like other visual methods, is more than a substitute for a table: It is a tool that can improve our reasoning about quantitative information. We recommend that the box plot be used more frequently.\r"

Internal medicine is faring less well in the residency match compared with other specialties than it did 10 years ago. It has also increased the number of residency positions offered more than other major specialties. A sizable proportion of first-year residency positions in internal medicine are not filled through the Match. Foreign medical graduates account for almost 50% of the first-year resident (R1) positions filled outside the Match. Programs most dependent on foreign medical graduates are in hospitals with limited medical school affiliation, smaller size, operated by churches or the Veterans Administration, and located in eastern states and large metropolitan areas. Despite concerns about quality and oversupply, almost 50% of the program directors expected to increase the size of their programs in 1988-1990. Residents are not being scheduled for fewer hours per week than they were 12 years ago but they are being scheduled for fewer nights. No trends were noted toward increased ambulatory care training sites away from the hospital campus.\r"

  ".W": "Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in a group of normally hearing subjects (n = 52 ears) and a group of patients demonstrating several common types of sensorineural hearing loss (n = 85 ears) in order to study the clinical applicability of acoustic emissions. In the normally hearing population, all ears demonstrated acoustic emissions that could be elicited at intensities below the normal subjective threshold for the sequence of clicks (mean, -5.2 dB hearing level [HL]). Sixty-seven percent of the normal ears showed long (greater than 20 ms) click-evoked emissions, and spectral analysis showed a broadband spectral component with several narrowband frequency peaks. In patients with sensorineural hearing loss, the incidence of acoustic emissions decreased and the detection threshold increased linearly with increasing threshold. No emissions were elicited from ears exhibiting subjective click thresholds greater than 35 dB HL. Hearing-impaired ears showed a significantly higher proportion of short duration emissions and a significant reduction in the mean number of narrowband frequency peaks in comparison to the controls. Therefore, acoustic emissions can be used as a reliable technique for objective study of normal micromechanical activity within the cochlea and for detection of subtle changes in cochlear disease. However, they have not been demonstrated to be useful in differentiating cochlear disease.\r"

In 15 dogs, we defined six distinct motor points by transmucosal stimulation at 3 mA while observing the resulting characteristic position of the arytenoid and true vocal cord. Five dogs were then paralyzed with succinylcholine in order to simulate bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Application of a 3-mA stimulus at each motor point yielded no motion of the cords, but when the current was increased to 20 mA, characteristic responses were elicited. In five other dogs, botulinum toxin was injected directly into laryngeal muscles. Stimulation was used in an attempt to quantify the degree of neuromuscular blockade. In the last group of five dogs, we simulated cricoarytenoid arthritis by scarifying the joint. The extent and nature of the joint's impairment could be demonstrated by stimulation. Transmucosal stimulation appears promising as a clinical technique for correlating particular vocal cord movements and thresholds of activation with specific laryngeal disorders. Additionally, such a technique may be useful in clarifying how each laryngeal muscle acts upon the cricoarytenoid joint.\r"

Abnormalities were identified in 12 of the 24 ears examined (eight of 12 patients studied). In two patients the CT examination strongly influenced the selection of the ear to be implanted. In four additional cases information felt to be useful in preoperative planning was provided. Useful information related to potential complications with the mechanical insertion of the electrode apparatus. We conclude that temporal bone abnormalities are common in the population undergoing cochlear implantation and that high resolution temporal bone CT is essential in preoperative evaluation. The CT scan should be interpreted with adequate knowledge of the operative procedure to evaluate any possible barriers to the mechanical insertion of the internal components of the system.\r"

The use of antihistamine tablets did not increase CBF even when it relieved the nasal symptoms. Immunotherapy, on the other hand, increased CBF in 66.7% of patients when it alleviated their nasal symptoms. The CBF before immunotherapy of patients who showed an increase CBF after treatment was statistically higher than that of patients who did not.\r"

Analyses of ear data showed a less than 10-dB change on PTA and discrete frequency thresholds for most ears. Of the ears that showed a threshold change greater than or equal to 10 dB, statistical significance was reached only at 4,000 Hz (p less than .01), where 11 ears representing ten patients dropped 10 to 15 dB. Speech discrimination data showed a greater than or equal to 16% change in score for 18 ears (12 patients). Sixteen of those ears (ten patients) had a 16% to 52% decrease in score (p less than .01), and the remaining two ears (two patients) showed a 20% and 30% improvement in score.

Each subject received a conventional vestibulometric test battery that included bithermal caloric testing and the FS test. The warm caloric media elicited larger nystagmus slow-phase eye velocities than the cool caloric media. Following warm caloric irrigations, FS was significantly smaller than that following cool caloric irrigations. It also worsened as a function of subject age. The results suggest that separate normal upper limits for FS need to be determined for cool and warm caloric testing. They also suggest that FS ability may decrease with age.\r"

Reflex activation of the CT may be responsible for the paramedian position of the vocal folds, and hence airway obstruction, in patients with bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis. Previous research has demonstrated the influence of superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) afferents on CT activity. The present study addresses the effects of vagal and RLN afferents. Electromyographic activity of the CT and right posterior cricoarytenoid muscle was monitored in anesthetized cats during tracheotomy breathing and in response to tracheal or upper airway occlusion in the intact animal. This was repeated following left RLN transection, bilateral vagotomy, and bilateral SLN transection. Vagotomy abolished CT response to tracheal occlusion and markedly reduced the response to upper airway occlusion. Vocal fold position following RLN transection appeared to correlate with CT activity; however, observed changes were minor.\r"

We investigated potential resistance mechanisms, including production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, ribosomal resistance, and decreased permeability. This strain (MIC, 200 micrograms/ml) had no detectable chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. In in vitro translation experiments in which we compared the resistant isolate with a susceptible strain of P. cepacia, inhibition of amino acid incorporation was equivalent even in organisms that were preincubated with sub-MICs of chloramphenicol. A 21.9-kilobase (kb) fragment of DNA was cloned which coded for chloramphenicol resistance; this fragment was expressed in P. cepacia but not in Escherichia coli. Quantitation of chloramphenicol uptake in the isogenic pair of susceptible and resistant organisms revealed a nearly 10-fold decrease of drug entry into the resistant strain. Comparison of isolated outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide patterns identified no significant differences between the isogenic pair of organisms. We concluded that the mechanism of chloramphenicol resistance in this strain is decreased permeability.\r"

Significant differences in the values for area under the curve, mean residence time, total body clearance, and renal clearance were observed between the geriatric and young groups. Mean elimination half-life values were 9.59 and 4.88 h for the geriatric and young groups, respectively. Total body and renal clearances were inversely correlated to age and directly correlated to creatinine clearance. Free fraction was not correlated to albumin concentration but was correlated exponentially to total cefonicid concentration. Despite the prolonged half-life values observed in our geriatric patients, the difference in mean trough concentrations was slight. Daily administration of a 15-mg/kg dose should provide adequate concentrations in serum and should not produce appreciable accumulation in geriatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and efficacy of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally, were compared with those of amoxicillin, 3.0 g, plus probenecid, 1.0 g orally, as single-dose therapy in 201 heterosexual patients (101 men and 100 women) with uncomplicated gonococcal infection. Treatment groups were comparable in age, duration of symptoms, number of sexual partners within the previous month, and number of previous episodes of sexually transmitted diseases. The cure rate for men treated with ofloxacin was 98% (47 of 48), and that for women was 100% (52 of 52). Cure rates for both men and women treated with amoxicillin-probenecid were 96% (51 of 53 men; 46 of 48 women). All 13 patients with positive rectal cultures and 7 of 8 patients with positive pharyngeal cultures treated with ofloxacin were cured. Neither regimen reliably eradicated coexistent infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The MIC of ofloxacin for all but two of 198 pretreatment isolates was 0.3 microgram/ml or less. The MIC of amoxicillin for 90% of isolates tested was 1.0 microgram/ml. Single oral doses of ofloxacin and of amoxicillin plus probenecid were equally effective for treatment of urethral and cervical gonorrhea. Ofloxacin appears promising as treatment for rectal and pharyngeal infection, but studies with larger numbers of patients with rectal or pharyngeal infection or both are required for confirmation. Relative contraindications in children and possibly pregnant women plus the potential for single-step, high-level resistance may limit the usefulness of quinolone therapy for gonorrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Carbovir is a novel carbocyclic nucleoside which has been shown to have potent in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus, the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Sprague-Dawley male rats were used to investigate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of carbovir. Six rats received carbovir (20 mg/kg of body weight) through the jugular vein, and blood samples were collected through the femoral vein 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after the dose. Four of these rats also received a 60-mg/kg oral dose of carbovir, and a similar blood sampling schedule was followed. Whole-blood samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction, and the carbovir concentration in the samples was analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The profile of carbovir concentration in blood versus time after the intravenous dose was biexponential, with a very rapid distribution phase. Terminal elimination half-life was 21.4 +/- 4.37 min, and total body clearance was 55.2 +/- 13.8 ml/min per kg, which was within the range of the hepatic blood flow. The volume of distribution at steady state was 1,123 +/- 250 ml/kg. The blood/plasma ratio and the plasma protein binding of carbovir in rat blood were determined in vitro by ultrafiltration. The plasma protein binding of carbovir was only 20% and was not concentration dependent. However, the blood/plasma ratio decreased significantly as concentration increased, indicating saturable binding sites in erythrocytes. After the oral dose, the terminal half-life was 81.0 +/- 67.6 min, indicating that oral carbovir followed \"flip-flop\" kinetics, with absorption being much slower than elimination of the drug from the body. Oral bioavailability was 0.101 +/- 0.035. Double peaks were present in the concentration-time profile for each rat receiving the oral dose, indicating either a delay in stomach emptying of the drug or slow dissolution of precipitated carbovir in the stomach and upper small intestine.\r"

  ".W": "The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a common cause of disseminated infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and is increasingly seen as a cause of infection in other immunocompromised patients. Traditional antimycobacterial therapy often is ineffective, and there is a clear need for antibiotics with proven activity against the MAC. Three agents, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem, were tested in vitro for activity against MAC strain 101. Amikacin was bacteriostatic, with an MIC of 4.8 micrograms/ml, which is significantly lower than the concentration in serum obtained with standard dosing. Imipenem and ciprofloxacin had little or no activity alone (MICs, greater than 16 and 4.7 micrograms/ml, respectively), but when they were combined with amikacin there was bactericidal activity. Each agent was tested individually and in combination by using the beige mouse model of disseminated MAC infection. There was no mortality in a group of animals infected with MAC 101 and treated with amikacin alone; also, there was a significant decrease in the infection of the blood, liver, and spleen. There was no apparent improvement in therapeutic effectiveness when amikacin was combined with the other agents. Neither ciprofloxacin nor imipenem was active as a single agent, which was consistent with the in vitro activities of these agents. Amikacin in combination with traditional antimycobacterial agents warrants further study as potential therapy for disseminated MAC infections.\r"

It appears that ciprofloxacin alone produced an initial eradication rate in at least one site in 50% of the patients, regardless of whether the treatment was for 5 or up to 14 days. All of the patients with eradication became recolonized within 1 week posttherapy. When rifampin was combined with ciprofloxacin, the eradication rate was 100% when the isolates were susceptible to both agents, and these patients remained free of methicillin-resistant S. aureus at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups.\r"

(S)-HPMPA inhibited the development of tail lesions caused by vaccinia virus if it was administered intraperitoneally or subcutaneously at a dosage as low as 5 mg/kg per day. All three compounds completely suppressed the development of skin lesions and the mortality associated therewith in hairless or athymic nude mice inoculated intracutaneously with HSV-1 or TK- HSV-1, if they were administered topically at a concentration as low as 0.1%; when (S)-HPMPA was applied topically at a concentration of greater than or equal to 0.3%, it completely abrogated mortality resulting from intracutaneous HSV-2 infection. Most dramatic were the effects shown by the compounds in mice inoculated intracerebrally with HSV-1, HSV-2, or TK- HSV-1, in which all three compounds given intraperitoneally at a dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg per day effected a significant reduction in the mortality rate of HSV-1-infected mice. The mortality of mice infected intracerebrally with HSV-2 or TK- HSV-1 was significantly reduced even when (S)-HPMPA was given at doses as low as 10 mg/kg per day. These data point to the great potential of the phosphonylmethoxyalkylpurines for both topical and parenteral treatment of HSV-1, HSV-2, and TK- HSV-1 infections.\r"

Ten of them received a dose of 0.5/0.5 g of imipenem-cilastatin at induction of anesthesia, followed by subsequent doses of 0.5/0.5 g every 6 h for 48 h. The other 10 patients were given 1.0/1.0 g imipenem-cilastatin in the same way for 48 h. Samples from serum, intestinal mucosa, and feces were taken for analysis of imipenem concentrations during the day of surgery. The mean concentrations in serum at 1 h after the first imipenem dose were 15.9 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml for the 0.5-g dose and 68.2 +/- 8.2 micrograms/ml for the 1.0-g dose. The mean half-lives were 1.5 and 1.4 h, respectively, and the mean areas under the serum concentration-time curve were 41.2 +/- 6.0 and 128.3 +/- 13.5 mg.h/liter, respectively. The imipenem concentrations in the intestinal mucosa varied between less than 0.1 and 3.6 mg/kg for the 0.5-g dose and 3.2 and 13.4 mg/kg for the 1.0-g dose. The concentrations in the fecal samples varied between less than 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg for the 0.5-g dose and 0.7 and 11.3 mg/kg for the 1.0-g dose. Fecal samples were also collected during the investigation period for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria--staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and enteroaerobic enterococci, and enterobacteria--were and anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria--staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and enterobacteria--were suppressed significantly during the imipenem prophylaxis period. Among the anaerobic bacteria, cocci, bifidobacteria, eubacteria, lactobacilli, clostridia, fusobacteria, and bacteroides decreased markedly during the same period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conscious rationing was required only episodically as some particular commodity, eg, transplant organs, was too scarce to meet demand, or as some patients lacked basic access to the health care system. Cost containment and the economic reorganization of medicine introduce a new sort of scarcity, requiring a different sort of rationing. \"Fiscal scarcity,\" the general contraction of health care dollars, means that because every medical decision has its cost, every decision is now subject to scrutiny for its economic as well as its medical wisdom. Therefore, every detail of medicine is an allocation problem. Many observers argue that physicians can nevertheless avoid directly trading patients' interests against economic considerations: through \"efficiency protocols\" that eliminate marginal benefits, through turning economic rationing decisions over to outside parties, through avoiding cost constraints until society has established a just health care allocation system. This article shows that none of these proposals permits the physician to escape cost-cutting at the bedside.\r"

Perceived liability was altered by physician behavior as follows: 43.1% of attorneys would advise clients that they received potentially negligent care when impairment was documented by a test for serum alcohol concentration and no advice was given regarding drunk driving, and 17.3% of attorneys would give similar advice when impairment was not documented by a test for serum alcohol concentration and no advice was given regarding drunk driving. In contrast, only 3.5% of attorneys would suggest possible negligence when impairment was documented by a test for serum alcohol concentration and with advice subsequently given not to drive. The coupling of diagnosing impairment by the serum alcohol concentration and driving advice is medically sensible and might result in minimal civil liability.\r"

There was a bimodal distribution of expenditures of Medicaid-paid gastrointestinal side effects. Most patients had low hospitalization costs, but an important minority had high hospitalization costs. Median ambulatory treatment costs during the 3-month study period for persons with gastrointestinal side effects was $27 and varied from $14 for those diagnosed as having nausea, vomiting, or heartburn to $393 for those diagnosed as having gastrointestinal bleeding. Median inpatient costs were $2006 and ranged from $1487 for persons with nausea, vomiting, or heartburn to $2486 for those with duodenal ulcer. For patients who had undergone an inpatient surgical procedure other than endoscopy alone, median hospital costs were $7209.

Mean respiratory rate did not significantly change during peritoneoscopy. Peritoneal gas insufflation stimulated increased ventilation and oxygen saturation, but no further changes in PCO2 or pH. We conclude that serious arterial oxygen desaturation and possibly some ventilation perfusion mismatch occur after sedation with intravenously administered meperidine-diazepam for peritoneoscopy with resultant hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis.\r"

Of the 3 who had parathyroid surgery, 2 had hyperplasia and 1 had a solitary adenoma, an unusually high incidence of hyperparathyroidism. Unusual features of lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism in this series include (1) low urinary calcium excretion and the absence of nephrolithiasis, (2) normal urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion, and (3) normal plasma inorganic phosphate. Eight patients (42%) required treatment for hypothyroidism. Three patients (16%) had impaired kidney function. While these observations do not contraindicate the continued use of lithium carbonate in manic depression, they strongly emphasize the need for close laboratory surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 47 patients with ischemic heart disease and acute myocardial infarction were allocated to 3 months' treatment with peroral magnesium (15 mmol/d) or placebo. Before, during, and after treatment, blood samples were taken to determine serum concentrations of cholesterol; triglyceride; high-density, low-density, and very-low-density lipoprotein; apolipoprotein A1 and B; and magnesium. We found a 13% increase in molar ratio of apolipoprotein A1:apolipoprotein B after magnesium treatment, as compared with a 2% increase in the placebo group (for mean differences between changes of the magnesium and the placebo groups). This increase was caused by a decrease in apolipoprotein B concentrations, which were reduced by 15% from 1.44 to 1.23 mmol/L in the magnesium group as compared with a slight increase in the placebo group. Triglyceride, and thereby very-low-density lipoprotein concentrations decreased by 27% after magnesium treatment (from 2.41 to 1.76 mmol/L, and from 1.1 to 0.79 mmol/L, respectively) as compared with much smaller decrements in the placebo group. Likewise, we found tendencies toward an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio/(low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) after magnesium treatment. The observed findings support the hypothesis that magnesium deficiency might be involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease by altering the blood lipid composition in a way that disposes to atherosclerosis.\r"

Significant improvement was observed at rest and at peak exercise in heart rate, pressure values, double product, and maximal ST depression with a prolongation of exercise duration. Measurements at the same work load in the post-verapamil test as at the pretreatment peak exercise showed a slower heart rate, lower blood pressure, less double product, and less ST depression as a more pronounced expression of drug efficacy. There was no deterioration in any parameter. In conclusion, improved myocardial performance can be demonstrated in asymptomatic ischemic patients when treated with verapamil, and this effect is particularly evident when data are compared with equal exercise duration in the posttreatment test as with peak exercise prior to therapy.\r"

Although technological advances permit the accurate measurement of bone density, identifying osteoporosis without searching for contributing diagnoses may result in remediable diseases being missed or in the initiation of inadvisable therapy. The value of comprehensive medical evaluation in conjunction with appropriate diagnostic studies was demonstrated in an osteoporosis referral center. We studied 300 consecutive persons who presented to an osteoporosis clinic. Using strict criteria, 180 patients (60%) had osteoporosis. Of these 180 patients, 83 (46%) had one or more contributing diagnosis, ie, a condition thought to accelerate bone loss. The largest single group was composed of persons with past or present exposure to glucocorticoids; the second largest group consisted of women who had undergone premature menopause. In all, 27 different contributing diagnoses were identified. Additionally, in 19 (11%) of the 180 patients with osteoporosis, a contributing diagnosis new to those patients was made. The evaluation of osteoporosis does not only entail measurement of bone density but must also take into consideration a patient's entire medical milieu.\r"

Lung cancer was most common (68%), especially adenocarcinoma or small (\"oat\")-cell types, followed by gastrointestinal primary cancers (9%), cancers of the bladder and thyroid (2% each), melanoma (2%), and lymphoma (2%). Breast cancer was remarkably absent, perhaps due to its greater systemic involvement prior to brain metastasis, or its earlier detection on physical examination. Overall group survival rates were 55% (6 months) and 13% (12 months), and cerebellar and noncerebellar metastases had the same survival rate at 12 months. The diagnostic evaluation of these patients, often extensive and costly, should be individually tailored, as 23% had complaints or findings indicative of their underlying primary cancer. Overall, chest roentgenograms and computed tomograms of the chest were the tests of greatest yield, followed by computed tomograms of the abdomen and pelvis. A rationale for evaluation is presented.\r"

Physicians were significantly better in predicting outcome in the critically ill.

In addition to receiving customary therapy, 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol and 92 to receive placebo. Outcome during the next 14 days was assessed using two main measures: the patient's clinical course as assessed by an alcohol withdrawal severity index; and the occurrence of treatment failure (composite measure including return to drinking, dropouts, and withdrawal lasting longer than 5 days). In addition, levels of craving for alcohol were assessed as an associated response variable. Overall, treatment failure occurred for 37% of the patients receiving atenolol and 52% of those receiving placebo. Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol, and their abnormal behavioral characteristics also resolved more rapidly. Levels of craving for alcohol were strongly associated with treatment failure; the group of patients who received atenolol included significantly fewer who reported high levels of craving 24 hours after treatment began (7% of patients receiving atenolol and 20% of those receiving placebo). We conclude that the outpatient management and treatment outcomes of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are improved in patients who receive atenolol, and that the beneficial effects are associated with reduced levels of craving for alcohol. If these results are confirmed by other investigators, atenolol may prove to play an important role in the outpatient management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\r"

Some ethics committees have undertaken clinical consultations themselves, but liability concerns and variable standards for membership hinder their efforts. An ethics consultation service comprising both physician-ethicists and nonphysician-ethicists brings complementary viewpoints to the management of particular cases. If they are to be effective consultants, however, nonphysician-ethicists need to be \"clinicians\": professionals who understand an individual patient's medical condition and personal situation well enough to help in managing the case. Ethics consultants and ethics committees may work together, but they have separate identities and distinct objectives: ethics consultants are responsible for patient care, while ethics committees are administrative bodies whose primary task is to advise in creating institutional policy.\r"

This effect may be mediated in part through suppression of in vivo platelet activity by omega-3 fatty acids. We observed that platelet survival, a sensitive indicator of in vivo platelet activity was prolonged from 6.4 +/- 1.5 days to 7.7 +/- 1.4 days by moderate amounts of dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for 6 weeks in a group of hyperlipidemic patients with preexisting, established atherothrombotic disorders. This effect on platelet survival was associated with a decrease in platelet arachidonic acid levels from 26.7 +/- 3.5% to 20.9% +/- 2.5% and a rise in platelet eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid measurements from essentially undetectable to 2.8% +/- 1.6% and 1.9% +/- 1.0%. Plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum apolipoprotein B levels rose significantly during the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation period. Platelet aggregation did not change. This study demonstrates that a modest amount of dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can significantly effect in vivo platelet activity in a population at high risk for recurrent atherothrombotic disorders.\r"

We report the results of a clinical trial using the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin to treat a patient with well-documented lithium-induced NDI that persisted following cessation of lithium treatment. The administration of a single dose of indomethacin resulted in a dramatic decrease in urine volume and increase in urine osmolality that persisted for several hours, and was independent of renal hemodynamic changes. Subsequently, the patient experienced a sustained, favorable effect on her polyuria during long-term (3 months) indomethacin therapy without a deleterious effect on her renal function. Indomethacin may be a useful therapeutic tool for the amelioration of lithium-induced NDI.\r"

Urinary protein excretion decreased significantly, from 2.27 +/- 0.49 g/d to 0.57 +/- 0.40 g/d after the first 12 months of the study, but increased to 1.43 +/- 0.63 g/d after the second 12 months of the study.

To address this issue, we reviewed the records of 236 consecutive patients with uveitis who were referred primarily by ophthalmologists to an internist in a university-based clinic. Patients were referred for a variety of purposes, including differential diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and desire for a second opinion. The study population included 121 male patients and 115 female patients. In 40% of all patients, a systemic disease thought to be causally related to the eye inflammation was diagnosed or its diagnosis was confirmed. While 53% of patients with anterior uveitis had a causally related systemic illness, only 17% of patients with posterior uveitis and 22% of patients with chorioretinitis had an associated systemic disease. The most frequently diagnosed systemic diseases were Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's syndrome, and sarcoidosis. These diagnoses were usually not known prior to referral. An internist can make a significant contribution to the evaluation of many patients with uveitis. Furthermore, most diagnoses can be established by a thorough history and physical examination, without extensive laboratory testing.\r"

Test samples of 10 patients each were selected from a large series of medically treated patients with significant coronary disease. Using detailed clinical summaries, 49 cardiologists each predicted the probability of 3-year survival and infarction-free survival for 10 patients. Cox regression models, developed using patients who were not in the test samples, were also used to predict corresponding outcome probabilities for each test patient. Overall, the model estimates of prognosis were significantly better than the doctors' predictions. The rank correlation of model predictions with 3-year survival was 0.60, compared with 0.52 for the physicians. Model predictions added significant prognostic information to the doctors' predictions, whereas the converse was not true. Where predictions were made by multiple doctors, the inter-physician variability was substantial. Neither practice characteristics nor extent of clinical experience significantly affected the physicians' predictive accuracy. In coronary artery disease, statistical models developed from carefully collected data can provide prognostic predictions that are more accurate than predictions of experienced clinicians made from detailed case summaries.\r"

Muscle weakness, defined as the failure to generate the expected force, was determined by two methods: (1) manual muscle testing and (2) measurement of MVC using a force transducer. Muscle strength was then quantified as the MVC in Newtons (N)/kg body weight. The percent decrease in both MVC (the Fatigue Index [FI]), and rectified-integrated electromyogram (RIEMG) at the end of 60sec of sustained MVC were computed. There were three main findings. (1) Muscle strength was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced in both muscles of the patient group: in ankle dorsiflexors, means = 1.62 +/- 0.7N/kg vs 4.8 +/- 0.5N/kg; in knee extensors, means = 3.2 +/- 1.8N/kg vs 7.8 +/- 1.5N/kg. (2) Fatigue was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in the patient group: for ankle dorsiflexors, means = 50 +/- 15% vs 34 +/- 13%; and for knee extensors, means = 62 +/- 17% vs 46 +/- 15%. There was a negative correlation between muscle strength and FI of only the knee extensors of the patients (r = -0.88, p less than 0.001). (3) The mean decline in RIEMG of the two muscles combined was also significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the patient group (means = 48 +/- 16% vs 2 +/- 11%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most common symptoms acknowledged were progressive weakness (87%), muscle pain (86%), fatigue (86%), decreased activity level (78%), joint pain (77%), and back pain (70%). The clinical impression in most of these patients was arthritis/arthralgia (71% of the patients) or muscle overuse or myofascial pain (71%). Eleven (14%) had evidence of nerve compression, although 39% complained of sensory loss. Five patients had respiratory problems that required evaluation. Recommendations proved helpful for 78% of those seen at follow-up. These recommendations included pacing, energy conservation (planning, use of wheelchair or motorized scooter), gentle stretching or strengthening exercise, use of orthotic devices, weight loss or nutritional counseling, gentle aerobic exercise, use of a cane, and use of adaptive equipment.\r"

Thirty-six patients (35%) had a remote history of a surgical arthrodesis of the ankle. Fifty-six subjects (54%) reported using lower extremity orthoses after the onset of their polio. At initial postpolio clinic evaluation 19 subjects (18%) were using lower extremity orthoses, and all of these patients had a remote history of orthotic use. After clinical evaluation, a new lower extremity orthosis was recommended for 37 subjects (36%). Nine of these patients had never used orthotic devices. New orthoses for a previously braced limb or an additional orthosis for a previously unbraced limb were prescribed more frequently in previously braced patients (28 of 56 vs 9 of 48, p less than 0.02). Seventy-two percent of subjects with ankle fusion required new orthoses; 19% of those without fusion required one (p less than 0.001). A questionnaire returned by 81 subjects (78%) indicated that appropriate orthotic prescription significantly improved the ability to walk, increased perceived walking safety, and reduced knee and overall pain (p = 0.04 to 0.008).\r"

The purpose of this study was to confirm that observation, to examine the relationship of leukocyte counts in TCU, MCU, and SPA to the leukocyte excretion rate (LER), and of pyuria to bacteriuria in this population. We collected sets of urine specimens obtained by SPA and intermittent catheterization (for leukocyte counts and quantitative culture) and timed urine collections (for LER determination). Fifty-two patients were studied for an average of five days. Leukocyte counts were performed in 241 SPA, 250 MCU, and 236 TCU specimens, and LER in 131 timed collections. The mean of the logarithm of leukocyte counts differed significantly between TCU and both MCU and SPA (p less than .0001). The difference between TCU and MCU was greater than 150 leukocytes/mm3 for 25% of paired specimens (mean 624 leukocytes/mm3, median 15 leukocytes/mm3). The statistical correlation between LER and leukocyte counts in all catheter specimens was significant; however, SPA and MCU frequently underestimated LER and TCU overestimated LER. Estimates of pyuria do not clearly separate bacteriuric from abacteriuric specimens. In spinal cord injured patients on intermittent catheterization, aliquots of catheter urine are not suitable for estimation of pyuria, and estimation of pyuria is not a feasible screening test for bacteriuria.\r"

The limitation appears to involve significant iliopsoas myofascial dysfunction manifested in tenderness, as shown by deep abdominal palpation of the psoas muscle, hip flexor contracture, pain elicited by the stretch maneuver of the spine and hip, and relative weakness of the psoas muscle when tested manually. These signs assisted in identifying the source of low back pain in six patients who had failed to respond to prior treatment. Therapy consisted of iliopsoas trigger point treatment using a dry needling technique, followed by self-administered postisometric relaxation exercise of the iliopsoas. In all cases, marked improvement of hip and spine extension, dramatic reduction of pain, and return to normal activity resulted. Given the low risk-to-benefit ratio, trigger point treatment is indicated in \"failed back syndrome\" and chronic low back pain after conservative therapy or surgery have been tried without success.\r"

The bladder of a sphygmomanometer was modified by folding and surrounding it in a sewn cloth bag. It was then attached to a board for improved stability during the tests. Thirty-seven men and 81 women aged 62 to 102 years were tested. Four muscle groups were statistically determined to best represent strength-two for upper limb and two for lower limb. These strength measures were correlated with anthropometric indices, and a step-wise multiple regression was used to determine the degree of association between the variables. Men were significantly stronger than women in absolute strength, but were not different when strength was expressed relative to body weight. Within each sex, however, age was the most important variable related to loss of strength; body weight was secondary or not significant. These results suggest that age is the most important factor for relating differences in strength in an older elderly population (those aged 75 to 90 or more years). This factor must be accounted for just as body weight or cross-sectional muscle area often are, when comparing strengths in a younger population.\r"

We reviewed our clinical experience of SCI occurring due to AS, and the literature regarding the natural history of these fractures. A significant number of individuals are not aware of their increased risk for spinal fracture and sustain spinal fractures without realizing it. Difficulties in diagnosis and inappropriate management of spinal fractures in these individuals have often resulted in severe neurologic sequelae and a mortality rate approximately twice that observed with similar fractures in a normal spine. The need for better patient education emphasizing the significance of even minor trauma, and a thorough evaluation of AS patients with a history of trauma is stressed.\r"

Relief of pain, induced by arm abduction, may be observed in cervical radiculopathy in which the lower cervical roots are involved. Reduced tension at the nerve root is the probable underlying mechanism that leads to pain relief. Shoulder abduction can be used not only as a diagnostic sign but also may be incorporated in the conservative management of patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy affecting the lower cervical roots.\r"

Three months later she developed subcutaneous nodules and migratory polyarthralgias. The diagnosis of DFN as the etiology of her arthritis was confirmed by synovial fluid analysis; in addition, magnetic resonance imaging of her long bones revealed multiple marrow infarcts. She was nonambulatory and required assistance with transfers because of severe joint pain. Treatment included local ice, prednisone, methadone, instruction on joint preservation and proper body mechanics, and ambulation with weight-bearing as tolerated with an assistive device. At the patient's discharge, her joint inflammation was clinically improved but not resolved, and she was independent in transfers and ambulation with a walker for short distances. Despite ongoing inflammation, functional improvement was accomplished through a rehabilitation program emphasizing partial weight-bearing ambulation rather than strengthening exercises.\r"

The electric current at the needle tip was measured during supramaximal stimulation of the median and peroneal nerves at distal and proximal sites. After measuring the area of uninsulated needle tip, the local current density was calculated. The maximum current during the stimulation of 0.05msec duration was 0.80mA and the resulting current density was 4.1mA/mm2. It is calculated that this current could cause a local maximum temperature rise of 2.5C in the tissue within 0.5mm of the needle tip. This current flow would not be expected to cause either direct electric or heat damage to the tissue.\r"

Previous reports have suggested an unusually high prevalence of age-related cataract in Tibet. A two-stage probability sample of persons aged 20 years or older from the 35 townships of the county targeted 2884 persons for inclusion in the study; 2665 (92.4%) were examined. Age-related cataract was diagnosed when (1) visual acuity was worse than 6/12 (20/40) because of nuclear or cortical (including posterior subcapsular) opacities, or (2) aphakia associated with a history of age-related cataract was present in either eye. The prevalence of age-related cataract among persons aged 20 to 39 years was 0.2%; among persons 40 years old or older, the prevalence was 11.8%. Cortical cataracts were by far the most common type of cataract diagnosed. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence in Tibet was 60% higher than the prevalence in a similar, previously conducted study of 6951 person in Shunyi County, northeast of Beijing (altitude, 50 m). A second, independent slit-lamp classification of lens status was conducted in the Tibet Eye Study using standard photographs previously described. Age-specific cataract prevalence was similar with the two examination techniques. Results from the Tibet Eye Study support previous suggestions of a high prevalence of age-related cataract in Tibet.\r"

Sustained retinal attachment was achieved in 56% of the eyes, with visual acuity improving to 20/400 or better in 28% of the eyes. Posterior segment vascular and avascular reproliferation was the major cause of anatomic failure, while generalized retinal vascular ischemia was felt to be the principal cause of poor visual results despite retinal attachment.

The absorption of each gas approximated a first-order kinetic equation with respect to bubble volume. The half-life of air was 1.6 days in phakic and 0.9 days in aphakic eyes. The half-life of 20% sulfur hexafluoride was 2.8 days in phakic and 2.4 days in aphakic eyes. The half-life of 10% perfluoropropane was 5.7 days in phakic, 4.5 days in aphakic, and 4.3 days in pseudophakic eyes. The difference in half-life among the three gases was significant. Intraocular gases had a shorter half-life in aphakic than in phakic eyes.\r"

The second pattern, which was relatively more severe, also showed a central rod and cone scotoma and eccentric fixation; however, there was more cone than rod dysfunction detected by electroretinography, and function was lost in the peripheral visual field before it was lost in the midperipheral field. A third pattern, which was rapidly progressive, showed central unsteady fixation and no measurable cone function. Patches of rod function were retained in the central and inferotemporal regions of the visual field. Most of the patients studied fit within the three patterns and the patterns were consistent within families.\r"

We report electrophysiologic and eye movement findings in a series of seven consecutive children with Joubert syndrome. Unlike patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis, all but one of these children had preserved flash and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials. Six of the seven children had abnormalities of smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and saccades. Six of the children had nystagmus: three had a pendular torsional nystagmus and three had a form of see-saw nystagmus. An alternating hyperdeviation was present in five of the patients, two of whom also had a tonic deviation of their eyes laterally. All seven patients had cerebellar vermis hypoplasia on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Developmentally delayed children with an absent or highly attenuated electroretinogram should be investigated for Joubert syndrome.\r"

Unfortunately, the use of metallic retinal tacks on a permanent basic mandates a retained intraocular foreign body that poses some potential for long-range toxic effects. Herein, we report the results of our initial experience with a temporary, biodegradable mechanical retinal fixation device (\"biopin\") in rabbits. When compared with metallic tacks, the biopins appeared to be well tolerated intraocularly, with minimal damage detectable at the light microscopic level. Disinsertion of the biopins occurred in 46% of the eyes within two weeks and in all eyes by four weeks. Initial signs of degradation of the biopins were observed at six weeks (median) in the ensectomized/vitrectomized eyes and at 12 weeks (median) in the nonvitrectomized eyes. Differences were found in the occurrence of retinal detachment between animals that underwent lensectomy/vitrectomy with insertion of two metallic tacks and animals that underwent insertion of one biopin without vitrectomy. The biopin has a potential as a vehicle for sustained release of pharmacologic agents to inhibit directly the development of vitreoretinal proliferation, thereby retarding or preventing subsequent retinal traction and detachment.\r"

Injection of intracameral ROS in the cat resulted in a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) from a baseline of 19.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg to a peak of 30.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg at 24 hours. By 48 hours, IOP returned to baseline. Control injection did not cause a change in IOP. Electron microscopy of the cat trabecular meshwork revealed occlusion of the intratrabecular spaces by ROS with little evidence of inflammatory activity.\r"

The goal of most treatments, including ionizing radiation or radiation and adjunct hyperthermia, is to destroy the reproductive capacity of the tumor. Cell cycling analysis with bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue only incorporated during DNA synthesis, was a useful indication of tumor control after hyperthermia was used to treat a Greene intraocular melanoma model. Cell cycling decreased from a mean of 16% before therapy to less than 1% in all the successfully treated tumors. Cell cycling changes preceded histologic evidence of cell death. In contrast, tumors that grew after insufficient treatment had increased cell cycling to a mean of 25%. Cell cycling studies with bromodeoxyuridine represent a sensitive gauge of the reproductive integrity of the tumor.\r"

During followup, sustained immunomodulation (including lymphopenia, particularly of the T helper cell subset; reduced ratio of helper cells to suppressor cells; and impaired in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen) was observed. Significant improvements in early morning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, pain score, grip strength, and 15-meter walk time were observed in both treatment groups, but these were not sustained through the followup period. Progressive joint damage was observed radiologically in both groups during followup. Thus, LI induced sustained immunosuppression, but resulted in only short-lived clinical improvement and was associated with progressive joint erosion in these patients.\r"

Using logistic regression, we found, as with previous studies, that work autonomy, social factors, and disease factors are important predictors of work disability. In the logistic regression model, self-assessed health status seemed to be more important than work factors in predicting work status. Further, family factors significantly contributed to the explanatory model, in that having more home responsibilities was associated with lower risk of work disability.\r"

We therefore studied the release of FN by alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of 17 patients with SSc and 14 controls. We found that SSc alveolar macrophages released significantly more FN than did those of controls. Furthermore, the level of FN correlated positively with the level of inflammation determined by cellular analysis of lavage fluid and negatively with carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. FN may therefore play a role in the development of lung fibrosis in SSc and may be a marker of alveolitis.\r"

The effects of 3 drugs, glycosaminoglycan polysulfate (Arteparon), pentosan polysulfate (SP-54), and zinc-chelated pentosan polysulfate (DH-40J), on inflammation-induced cartilage degradation were also examined. Implanted articular cartilage from noninflamed air pouches showed a reduction in total proteoglycan (PG) content (as hexuronic acid), but not in PG extractability or aggregation, compared with cartilage maintained in tissue culture. The injection of peptone into the air pouch as an inflammogen caused an influx of leukocytes and plasma exudate and a reduction in implanted articular cartilage PG content, extractability, and aggregation, which was significantly greater than that which occurred in noninflamed air pouches. In vitro experiments demonstrated that peptone did not have a direct effect on cartilage PG degradation. Daily injection of Arteparon, SP-54, or DH-40J (10 mg/kg) into peptone-inflamed air pouches significantly increased the PG content, extractability, and aggregation in implanted articular cartilage, compared with that in cartilage from non-drug-treated control animals. The infiltration of leukocytes into the peptone-inflamed air pouches was significantly reduced by daily administration of Arteparon, 10 mg/kg. At an equivalent dose, DH-40J increased leukocyte numbers in the pouch fluid, whereas SP-54 had no significant effect on leukocyte accumulation.\r"

Whole-body radiographs and histologic sections of the hindlimbs were scored for presence and severity of arthritis. C3H-A(vy) mice treated with RAc in any dose had a significantly higher incidence of arthritis than placebo-treated mice. Histologic evidence of enthesopathic disease closely paralleled the radiographic changes and ranged from small enthesophytes at tendinous and capsular insertions to complete periarticular bony bridging. Articular cartilage was not grossly affected. The incidence and severity of arthritis were significantly correlated with the total dose of RAc administered. The bony metaplasia induced by RAc was similar to the pathologic changes caused by other retinoids. This model may be useful for studying the pathogenesis of periarticular bone formation in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and related syndromes.\r"

In all cases, the serum KS levels were within the normal range. Values were not related to the cartilage uronic acid concentration, the rate of net 35SO4 glycosaminoglycan synthesis, or the histopathologic changes of OA. Although the serum KS concentration was not helpful as an indicator of the current status of the articular cartilage abnormality in the OA knee, serial samples from 6 dogs showed an increase of at least 10% over the baseline KS level at both timepoints following surgery (P = 0.031 and 0.027). This presumably reflects changes in proteoglycan metabolism in the unstable knee, although the possibility of a systemic change in proteoglycan metabolism following cruciate ligament transection cannot be excluded.\r"

However, whether or not CALD differs from chronic non alcoholic liver disease (CLD) in lipid peroxidation, is still questionable. Thirty-eight patients affected by CALD and CLD who were matched for age, sex, nutrition and liver function tests (LFTs) and 17 controls (C) took part in this study. The following tests were performed: serum and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) determination by the TBA test, liver total glutathione (GSH) estimate, mitochondrial (ALDH2) and cytosolic (ALDH1) aldehyde dehydrogenase activity determinations. Patients who showed signs of malnutrition were excluded from this study. Serum and hepatic TBA-reactive substances resulted in a slight increase in chronic liver patients compared to controls but did not show any difference between CALD and CLD groups. Liver total glutathione did not show any change. Hepatic ALDH2 activity was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in CALD than in CLD and control patients whereas ALDH1 did not show any difference. These results suggest that the increased lipid peroxidation in CALD and in CLD is probably secondary to liver damage rather than being the pathogenic factor.\r"

  ".W": "Young adult male rats were maintained on a regimen of twice daily intragastric administration of 4 ml of 35% (v/v) ethanol in water (daily dose approximately 7.0 g/kg) or 4 ml of calorifically equivalent sucrose solution over approximately 100 days. A second control group received no intragastric solutions. Under Valium-Hypnorm anaesthesia, parotid saliva was collected by intra-oral duct cannulation following stimulation by pilocarpine (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or by isoprenaline (30 mg/kg s.c.). In the ethanol-dosed rats the initial parotid salivary flow rate was raised in comparison to control animals by 39% after pilocarpine stimulation and by 37% after isoprenaline stimulation. The protein concentration was significantly reduced in saliva from ethanol-dosed rats compared to control groups but the amylase activity per ml of saliva was not significantly different from control groups. After pilocarpine stimulation, the [K+] was significantly higher in ethanol-dosed rats than in controls, but the [Na+] was effectively lower (allowing for flow rate differences). The blood-ethanol level was zero at the time of collection of saliva, suggesting that the salivary differences are due to functional adaptation induced in acinar and ductal epithelia by prolonged repeated exposure to high doses of ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of long-term ethanol administration on the membrane mechanism of thiamine entry in rat enterocytes was investigated by using microvillous vesicles of small intestine. Experiments were carried out in three groups of Wistar albino rats of both sexes (290-400 g of initial body wt). Group I did not receive any treatment, group II received 4.7 g of ethanol/kg body wt (as a 50% hydroalcoholic solution) daily by gastric gavage for 35 days and group III (pair-fed controls) received a daily solution of saccharose (isoenergetic with the dose of ethanol administered to group II) by gastric gavage for 35 days. Ethanol or saccharose were administered in the morning and a standard diet was given throughout the treatment period. All animals were killed by decapitation 24 hr after the last administration, when the blood level of ethanol was virtually zero. Microvillous small intestinal vesicles were incubated with 3H-thiamine (3H-T) at 25 degrees C and the amount of 3H-T taken up was measured by a rapid filtration method. Compared with data obtained in groups I and III, chronic ethanol administration was found to induce a statistically significant decrease in 3H-T vesicular uptake at 4 sec (determined at 3H-T concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 7.5 microM) and a decrease in the apparent Jmax (maximal transport rate) value of the saturable component, without affecting the apparent Km (half-saturation concentration) value. These results indicate that in rats chronic ethanol administration may impair the intestinal absorption of thiamine by reducing thiamine entry into the enterocyte.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of single and repeated inhalations of acetaldehyde (AcAl) on spontaneous activity and the metabolisms of cerebral monoamines and neuroactive amino acids were investigated. Both single and repeated inhalations of AcAl induced a significant increase of spontaneous activity at the initial stage followed by the loss of motor activity and coma. The AcAl inhalation-induced central excitement, exhibited by hyperkinesia and occasional jumpings, were found to be more severe following a single administration than by repeated ones. These abnormal behaviors observed following a single administration of AcAl, were accompanied by significant decreases of noradrenaline in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and of dopamine in the brainstem. In addition, it was found that these decreases in catecholamines were associated with significant decreases in the contents of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in brain. The contents of aspartic acid in the cerebral cortex and of GABA in the brainstem also showed an increase. On the other hand, animals subjected to the repeated inhalation of AcAl and exhibiting a state of central depression, showed the increase of adrenaline as well as the decrease of GABA in the cerebellum. These results suggest that a single inhalation of AcAl may induce central excitation as well as facilitate the metabolic turnover of cerebral catecholamines, while repeated inhalation of AcAl may result in central depression accompanied by decreased turnover of central catecholamines. Possible involvement of the changes in cerebral aspartic acid and GABA in the exhibition of central effects of AcAl is also suggested.\r"

The experiment was introduced into an established institution by means of an innovative educational track running parallel to the more conventional curriculum. Students in the innovative track, compared with those in the conventional tract, tended to score lower on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part I examination (basic sciences) and higher on NBME Part II (clinical sciences), received higher clinical grades on clinical clerkships, and experienced less distress. They were more likely than conventional-track students to retain their initial interest in or switch their preference to careers in family medicine. The parallel-track strategy for introducing curriculum reform succeeded in fostering institutional acceptance of continuing educational innovation. Generic steps in overcoming institutional barriers to change are identified.\r"

By using a retrospective faculty-time study and the two hospitals' estimated costs for education, education costs of each hospital were compared--within and across facilities--with annual hospital operating expenses, with inflation, and by educational program. Unit costs were estimated for undergraduate and graduate medical students. Over the study period, allocated education costs averaged 13-14% of the hospitals' operating budgets. The combined mean allocated cost per medical student and resident was approximately +73,000 in 1983-84. During this period, allocated education costs were in line with medical inflationary trends and did not drive hospital expense increases. These findings suggest that policymakers wishing to restrain the rise in health care costs should look beyond cutting the costs of education programs and find other solutions.\r"

Following an introductory discussion, the students are divided into small groups and sent to various departments of the hospital--wards, kitchen, laundry, maintenance workshop, X-ray department, and surgery--to observe and evaluate the work environment. Following this activity, the students reconvene and discuss the health implications of what they have seen. This way of providing the factory visit is well accepted by the students, saves time, and contributes directly to the students' awareness of their own working environment.\r"

In the testes, autoradiographic studies showed receptors in the interstitium in all species. In rat interstitial cells fractionated by Percoll gradient, AII receptors coincided with hCG receptors indicating that AII receptors are located on the Leydig cells. In Leydig cells and membranes from rat and rhesus monkey prepuberal testes, AII receptors were specific for AII analogues and of high affinity (Kd=nM). During development, AII receptor content in rat testes decreases with age parallel to a fall in the ratio of interstitial to tubular tissue. In the ovary, the distribution of AII receptors was dependent on the stage of development, being high in the germinal epithelium and stromal tissue between five and 15 days, and becoming localized in secondary follicles in 20-and 40-day-old rats. No binding was found in primordial or primary follicles. In rhesus monkey ovary, AII receptors were higher in stromal tissue and lower in granulosa and luteal cells of the follicles. Characterization of the binding in rat and monkey ovarian membranes showed a single class of sites with a Kd in the nmol/L range and specificity similar to that of the adrenal glomerulosa and testicular AII receptors. Receptors for AII were also present in membrane fractions from PMSG/hCG primed rat ovaries. Infusion of AII (25 ng/min) or captopril (1.4 micrograms/min) during the PMSG/hCG induction period had no effect on ovarian weight or AII receptor concentration in the ovaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immunoblots of sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using anti-LMrA sera showed that HMrA from each of the three sources contained a subunit that was identical to LMrA with respect to molecular weight and heterogeneity. Thus, no difference in the HMrA from these three sources could be demonstrated. It is concluded that HMrA contains at least one subunit that is very similar if not identical to LMrA.\r"

There were no significant differences in the rates of neck cancer recurrence among the elective neck irradiation, dissection, and combined treatment groups. Elective neck irradiation and neck dissection in patients with clinically negative nodes seemed equivalent in their ability to control neck disease. The decision as to which form of therapy is preferable must therefore be based on other criteria.\r"

The technique of augmented fixation of mandibular fractures using a threaded basal Kirschner wire was successfully used in seven patients. It offered the distinct advantage of rigid basal fixation that augmented interosseous and maxillomandibular fixation techniques. It was especially effective in stabilizing and promoting bone healing in unfavorable comminuted parasymphyseal fractures. Its ease and rapidity of application from readily available materials made it an effective alternate to elaborate techniques such as compression-plating systems.\r"

No qualitative difference was found within the two population groups. Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were the most prevalent beta-lactamase-producing isolates in both groups. Staphylococcus aureus had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production on the tonsillar surface of children with recurrent tonsillitis, while Streptococcus pyogenes was more prevalent in the tonsillar surface cultures of children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy. The bacterial density was high but not significantly different in both groups of children. The similar microbial composition and density of both groups and the higher rate of S pyogenes recovery may signify a subclinical disease or normal flora in children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy.\r"

Eighteen patients with undifferentiated squamous cell carcinomas presented histologic characteristics of undifferentiated carcinomas of nasopharyngeal type. Radiosensibility and radiocurability (complete sterilization with 70 Gy administered) was found in this group with an excellent long-term control of local disease (77% at 10 years actuarial). Epstein-Barr virus-related serologic tests were performed for seven patients. Four of them presented the serologic anti-Epstein-Barr virus titer patterns, generally associated with undifferentiated carcinomas of nasopharyngeal type (1280 to 5120 for viral capsid antigen/IgG and 40 to 320 for viral capsid antigen/IgA). These observations confirm that undifferentiated carcinomas of the nasopharyngeal type may arise outside the nasopharynx.\r"

The endoscopic sinus technique offers outstanding visualization and a safe, straight-forward approach to the sphenoid sinus. Four patients with documented mucocele of the sphenoid sinus were treated successfully with endoscopic sinus surgery. The technique involves partial removal of the inferior middle turbinate and direct entrance into the sphenoid sinus through the anterior sinus wall. Other sinus abnormalities can be treated simultaneously as required. Sphenoid sinus mucocele is discussed from the standpoint of cause, clinical presentation, and treatment options.\r"

Multiple clinical variables were significantly more common in the elderly group of patients (65 per cent), in those having non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid therapy (56 per cent), in patients where there is an absence of a previous dyspeptic history (69 per cent), and when risk factors such as delayed presentation (33 per cent) and the presence of shock on admission to hospital (27 per cent) are present. Definitive operations (vagotomy or gastrectomy) had an increased mortality rate in the elderly (P = 0.018). Risk scores based upon the presence of shock, delayed presentation or concurrent medical illness could have predicted 87 per cent of postoperative deaths in elderly subjects, and it is suggested that risk stratification and greater caution in the use of definitive operations for perforated ulcer may result in a reduction in the high mortality rate in elderly subjects.\r"

We studied clinicopathologically 83 patients (182 lesions) with synchronous multiple gastric cancer and compared them with patients who had solitary cancers only in the same period. We found that elderly men had a relatively high incidence of multiple gastric cancer, and that early cancer of the elevated well differentiated type was the most common. Of the 182 lesions, as many as 42 (23.1 per cent) were missed in the preoperative examination. Eighteen of these 42 lesions were found only with the aid of a microscope in sections almost incidentally excised. Small flat lesions tended to be missed. We should always be conscious that other gastric lesions may be present when treating patients with gastric cancer.\r"

By multiple regression analysis it was found that the pressure in the distal oesophageal high pressure zone, the presence of a hiatal hernia, the intra-abdominal length of the high pressure zone, the amplitude of the contraction waves in the distal oesophagus and age all significantly participated in the determination of the amount of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The pressure in the distal oesophageal high pressure zone was the single variable that correlated most strongly to the amount of reflux. Although the amount of reflux increased significantly with increasing weight as measured by Broca's index, this variable did not participate in the determination of reflux by the multiple regression test. The study emphasizes the role of the pressure and intra-abdominal length of the distal oesophageal high pressure zone as the primary antireflux barrier. It also shows that a hiatal hernia plays a role in generating gastro-oesophageal reflux through a mechanism other than affecting the pressure and the intra-abdominal length of the high pressure zone.\r"

Sixteen postoperative patients also underwent oesophageal manometry. All control and pre-operative patients had a marshmallow transit time of less than 1 min; 67 per cent of the early postoperative patients had prolonged transit and 70 per cent of the late tests were similarly abnormal. Prolonged oesophageal transit as measured by marshmallow swallow correlated well with symptoms of solid food dysphagia. Most, but not all, patients with an abnormal marshmallow swallow had abnormal manometric findings. The oesophageal transit of solid food is significantly slowed after the Angelchik procedure and this is not a transient postoperative phenomenon.\r"

During the same period only one patient was treated with surgery. The patients included seven women and two men with a mean age of 62 years. Three patients had a single cyst and six patients had multiple cysts. The size of the largest cysts varied between 5 and 20 cm (mean 10 cm). Patients with multiple liver cysts had repeated punctures and sclerosing procedures (up to eight times); 50-3100 ml of cyst fluid (mean 650 ml) was drained per procedure. One patient had symptoms of moderate alcohol intoxication; otherwise no complications were noted. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography or ultrasonography for 8-54 months (median 18 months). The results have been considered successful in eight out of nine patients who had cyst regression and reduced symptoms. Two patients, however, required additional surgical treatment due to residual and multiple cysts. Computed tomography-guided alcohol sclerotherapy of non-parasitic liver cysts appears to be a safe and effective initial therapy.\r"

Of the 45 patients with gallbladder injuries, 39 were due to stab wounds. Nine of the 45 injuries were repaired by primary suture without complication. Five patients underwent cholecystostomy and all developed biliary fistulae, which resulted in prolonged hospitalization. Cholecystectomy was performed in 31 patients; in retrospect many of these gallbladders could have been preserved because on only eight occasions was the gallbladder extensively damaged. Of eight extrahepatic bile duct injuries, the three partial transections managed by primary repair had a successful outcome, while the five complete transections were managed by a variety of techniques. Delayed diagnosis, failure of operative recognition of the injury and improper management were factors that led to mortality in two patients and prolonged morbidity in another. We conclude that suture repair is the operation of choice for gallbladder stab wounds without extensive injury. Ductal injury must be recognized. Partial transections are best managed by primary repair. Complete transections should be managed by primary duct jejunal anastomosis if the expertise is available.\r"

Rats were studied at 2, 4 and 6 days after the inoculation of live Walker cells. A control group received dead Walker cells. No tumour was visible in control groups at 2, 4 and 6 days after inoculation. Similarly in rats injected with live cells no tumour was visible at 2 days after inoculation but at 4 and 6 days the percentage hepatic replacement was (mean +/- s.d.) 7.0 +/- 2.3 and 27.9 +/- 6.80 respectively. The hepatic perfusion index was significantly raised at 4 and 6 days after inoculation of live cells compared with control animals and those receiving viable cells after 2 days inoculation. Portal flow and portal venous inflow were significantly reduced when the hepatic perfusion index increased but hepatic arterial flow did not alter. Changes in the hepatic haemodynamics were accompanied by increases in the portal and splanchnic vascular resistance and an increase in the amount of arteriovenous shunting through the liver. These findings confirm studies that the hepatic perfusion index is useful in the detection of occult liver metastases but that the change is not a consequence of an increase in the hepatic arterial flow.\r"

The severity of the disease was assessed by Ranson's bioclinical and computed tomography scan scoring systems. The retroperitoneal approach consisted of a left lateral incision, just anterior to the 12th rib, allowing direct access to the pancreas and a complete manual exploration of the gland and peripancreatic spaces. All patients but one were operated on for infected necrosis. The overall mortality rate was 33 per cent but was lower in the patients operated on primarily through a direct retroperitoneal approach (18.2 per cent). Twenty patients (50 per cent) developed a local complication (haemorrhage, colon fistula and/or necrosis). The direct retroperitoneal approach permits the removal of necrosis and several reoperations without the risk of large wound dehiscence and does not preclude the extension of the incision to a subcostal incision when necessary.\r"

Of these, 126 patients had contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans within 72 h of admission; 92 of these attacks were clinically mild, 34 were clinically severe. A single consultant radiologist reported the scans 'blind' and noted whether pancreatic enhancement was normal, increased or decreased, and whether there was loss of peripancreatic tissue planes. The maximum anteroposterior measurement of the pancreatic head and body were multiplied together to produce a 'pancreatic size index' (cm2). Significantly more patients with severe attacks had decreased pancreatic enhancement (79 versus 58 per cent, P = 0.01) and loss of peripancreatic tissue planes (82 versus 54 per cent, P = 0.006). The median (range) pancreatic size index for clinically severe attacks was 12.8 cm2 (3.0-52.5), and for mild attacks was 6.0 cm2 (1.1-23.4), P less than 0.0001. Modified Glasgow criteria had a sensitivity of 85 per cent and specificity of 79 per cent for clinically severe attacks. A pancreatic size index of greater than or equal to 10 cm2 had a sensitivity of 71 per cent and specificity of 77 per cent for clinically severe attacks. In conclusion, although there were highly significant differences between the clinically severe and mild groups with respect to pancreatic enhancement, peripancreatic tissue planes and pancreatic size indices, these CT criteria did not improve on modified Glasgow criteria for prediction of disease severity.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of proctocolectomy and formation of an ileal reservoir with ileoanal anastomosis is well described. It is believed that the conservation of a rectal muscular cuff is necessary for continence but no data are available to support this contention. The aims of this study were to describe the clinical and physiological aspects of continence after proctocolectomy and ileal J pouch anastomosis without conservation of a rectal muscular cuff. Eighteen consecutive patients (mean age 37.3 years, 16 ulcerative colitis, two familial polyposis) who underwent proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis on the dentate line were studied 6 months after closure of the loop ileostomy. The 18 patients and eight controls underwent: (a) anal manometry; (b) determination of maximum tolerable volume (MTV); (c) liquid continence test (infusion of NaCl at 60 ml/min for 25 min) with simultaneous measurement of ileal reservoir pressure. The volume evacuated during 5 min after the continence test was also measured. The frequency of bowel actions was (mean +/- s.e.m.) 5.3 +/- 0.4 per 24 h (nocturnal 1.14 +/- 0.26). Seventeen of 18 patients (94 per cent) had normal continence and defaecation; one patient was incontinent. A decrease in resting anal canal pressure (102.5 +/- 4 versus 47.5 +/- 6 cmH2O) was observed after ileoanal anastomosis. A rectoanal inhibitory reflex was elicited in one of the 18 patients (6 per cent). Patients were able to retain 1023 +/- 68 ml saline during the liquid continence test. The percentage evacuation of the ileal reservoir was 61 +/- 4.5 per cent. Correlations were found (P = 0.05) between daily stool frequency and the volume of saline retained during the liquid continence test. It is concluded that conservation of a rectal muscular cuff is not necessary for the achievement of good clinical results.\r"

In the questionnaire, the subjects were asked about previous treatment for colorectal neoplasm and rectal bleeding during the previous 6 months, specified as to type. All participants were asked to perform Hemoccult II blood testing over 3 days. Of 13,759 randomly selected subjects 9040 (66 per cent) performed the test and returned the questionnaire. Three hundred and fifty-four subjects with a positive Hemoccult II test and/or a proven previous colorectal neoplasm had a full assessment including double-contrast enema and rectosigmoidoscopy to 60 cm. Eighteen carcinomas and 61 adenomas were thus diagnosed. The population was followed for from 20 to 29 months, during which time rescreening was undertaken. An additional 34 subjects with carcinomas and 90 with adenomas were identified during this period. A significant correlation between the presence of a colorectal neoplasm and a previous history of colorectal neoplasm, a positive Hemoccult II and a previous history of bright red bleeding but not dark bleeding was found. The possibility of diagnosing a neoplasm was two, four and 19 times higher in a subject with a previous history of bleeding, a history of colorectal neoplasm, or a positive Hemoccult II respectively. Screening by faecal occult blood testing, therefore, at the moment seems to be the best and only practicable method.\r"

  ".W": "Anorectal pressures at rest, during conscious contraction of the external sphincter, during serial distension of the rectum and during straining to inflate a balloon were measured in 56 patients (21 patients with full thickness rectal prolapse, 24 patients with anterior mucosal prolapse, 11 patients with solitary rectal ulcer) and in 30 normal subjects. Both basal and squeeze pressures were significantly lower in the three groups of patients compared with matched normal controls (P less than 0.05). During increases in intra-abdominal pressure, anal pressure remained above maximum rectal pressure (P less than 0.05) in normal controls, with the highest anal pressures being recorded in the most caudal anal channels. In contrast, anal pressures tended to be lower than rectal pressures during this manoeuvre in patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer, and the highest pressures were recorded in the channels nearest the rectum. During serial distension of the rectum, 64 per cent of patients with solitary rectal ulcer, 75 per cent with anterior mucosal prolapse and 76 per cent with rectal prolapse, but only 10 per cent of controls, showed repetitive rectal contractions. The highest anal pressure always remained higher than rectal pressure during rectal distension in normal subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in patients. The threshold rectal volume required to cause a desire to defaecate and the maximum tolerable volume were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in each of the patient groups, compared with normal subjects. The similarity in the results from patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer support the hypothesis that they share a common pathophysiology. In each of the groups, the rectum is hypersensitive and hyper-reactive, and weakness of the anal sphincter creates the conditions for prolapse of the rectum to occur into or through the anal canal.\r"

Deep vein thromboses were diagnosed by isotope uptake in three of 56 patients (5.4 per cent) in the above-knee group and one of 58 patients (1.7 per cent) in the below-knee group. These differences are not statistically significant. Results suggest that below-knee stockings are as effective as above-knee in the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis.\r"

The records showed 131 amputations were performed in 106 patients at the district hospital and 22 amputations on 17 patients at the local university hospital, referral centre, altogether 57 men and 66 women. This gave an amputation incidence of 46 per 10(5) inhabitants per year. Of the amputees 47 per cent were older than 80 years. Only two patients underwent reconstructive vascular surgery (at the university hospital) before surgery. Final amputation level was above-knee in 61 per cent of the patients treated at the district hospital. Mortality rates at 30 days and 2 years after the amputation were 23 and 56 per cent, respectively, and the age-corrected survival after 2 years was 55 per cent. For patients who came from and eventually returned to their own homes the mean hospital stay amounted to 184 days (postoperative deaths excluded). After amputation 26 patients were trained to wear a prosthesis and 16 of these used the prosthesis 2 years after amputation. The present study underlines the need for prospective and parallel studies of vascular surgery and amputation as well as analyses of the risk factors involved in lower limb ischaemia in defined populations.\r"

The braided materials transferred greater numbers of cells than did the monofilament sutures (P less than 0.001), but significant differences were also observed between polyglycolic acid and polyamide (P less than 0.001) and between polypropylene and stainless steel (P less than 0.05). Secondly, the firm adherence of tumour cells to the suture materials was assessed by an in vitro technique. The Mtln3 cells were found to adhere in significantly greater quantities to the braided sutures than to the monofilaments (P less than 0.001) and this was supported by in vivo tumour growth studies. These findings may have implications for colorectal cancer surgery in man.\r"

The median follow-up has been 40 (range 4-112) months. No leaks or fistulae arose from the strictureplasties. The median weight gain 3 months postoperatively was +4.0 kg. Four patients subsequently required a further 13 strictureplasty procedures, between 12 and 36 (median 18) months after the initial operation; all but one of the previous strictureplasties were patent. Thirteen patients have been symptom free following surgery, four have required further medical therapy for recurrent Crohn's disease and three have sustained episodes of self-limiting intestinal colic. Strictureplasty is a safe and effective procedure in selected patients undergoing surgery for obstructive Crohn's disease.\r"

An additional untreated cohort served as controls and a further cohort was treated by radical surgical resection. A partial response as evidenced by ulceration was seen in all laser-treated tumours. In the cohort treated by 2 W for 600 s there was complete loss of palpable tumour, and in five out of the ten animals there was no evidence of local recurrence following a prolonged period of observation. Three of these eventually died from metastatic disease and two were cured. There was a significant prolongation of survival in this cohort compared with the controls (median 70 days versus 30 days, P less than 0.05), but not in any of the other cohorts. Histological assessment of tumours 2 days after laser treatment showed a central area of degeneration with shrunken and densely staining nuclei and disorganized cytoplasm, the boundary between the degenerate zone and surrounding viable tumour being well defined. The technique might be used to induce necrosis of intrahepatic and other solid organ tumours.\r"

  ".W": "A unifying pathophysiological hypothesis states that the plasminogen activating activity (PAA) of the peritoneal mesothelium determines whether the fibrin which forms after peritoneal injury is either lysed or organized into permanent fibrous adhesions. The PAA of human peritoneal biopsies was measured using a fibrin plate lysis technique to assess the changes that occur in inflammation and ischaemia, conditions which both produce fibrous adhesions. Activity was found in all biopsies from normal parietal and visceral (appendix, bowel and omentum) peritoneum with no significant site-to-site variation. Inflamed peritoneum (parietal, appendicular and mesenteric) had significantly less PAA compared with normal peritoneum; visceral ischaemia also resulted in a significant decrease of PAA. These reductions in human peritoneal PAA observed in inflammation and ischaemia support the view that mesothelial PAA plays a key part in the prevention of events leading to the production of fibrous adhesions.\r"

  ".U": "89248401\r", 
  ".W": "Sixty-nine patients with primary retroperitoneal tumours (17 benign, 52 malignant including 4 malignant tumours of uncertain origin) were reviewed to determine the best form of surgical strategy. Total resection was performed in 88 per cent of benign cases and in 65 per cent of malignant cases. In 62 per cent of the total resections for malignant tumours, en bloc excision included adjacent organs or anatomical structures. Operative mortality rate (in terms of the total number of operations performed) was 5 per cent. Postoperative complications occurred in 14 per cent and recurrences in 35 per cent. The overall 5-year survival rate was 67 per cent in patients with totally resected tumours and zero in patients whose tumours were treated by partial resection or biopsy. An aggressive surgical approach aimed at total excision of the tumour is the best form of therapy currently available. In the totally resected retroperitoneal tumour, the use of adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy depends on the grade of the malignancy and clearance as assessed histologically. Careful follow-up based on the use of computerized axial tomography and ultrasound allows early identification of recurrence at a stage when the recurrence is amenable to total resection.\r"

Fifteen lesions disappeared and 56 had the classical histology of fibroadenoma, mean size 2.5 cm; 30 of the latter continued to grow throughout the study. Cytology is essential to exclude malignancy if conservative treatment is considered, and is helpful in identifying a benign lesion. A period longer than 12 months may be required for resolution of a fibroadenoma and removal under local anaesthesia as a day case offers a simple alternative.\r"

Although morbidity was higher in patients with giant spleens compared with those undergoing resection of smaller spleens the incidence of serious complications was small, and there were no operative or in-hospital deaths. In addition, virtually all patients benefited either on the basis of minimized haematological defect, or palliation of symptoms. Further, the injection of 1 ml of 1:10,000 adrenaline into the splenic artery before splenic mobilization reduced the splenic volume by approximately 40 per cent on average, and resulted in improved exposure, thereby facilitating the procedure.\r"

There were 13 patients with primary Raynaud's, ten with Raynaud's secondary to scleroderma and eight men with vibration white finger (VWF) disease. We have also measured platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen and adrenaline in 19 normal subjects, 22 patients with primary Raynaud's, 12 with Raynaud's secondary to scleroderma and 14 men with VWF. When compared with our normal subjects, patients with VWF have an elevated thromboxane B2 level, with a normal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) level. Their platelets are less sensitive to ADP and collagen. Patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's have elevated thromboxane B2 levels but this is much more marked in the secondary group. Patients with primary Raynaud's have a normal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha level but in patients with secondary Raynaud's the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha level is markedly raised. The platelets from both groups are more sensitive to ADP and collagen and this is more marked in the secondary group. Whether these phenomena are a cause or an effect of vasospasm remains unknown.\r"

No wound infections were observed, and the rate of early surgical complications was 1.5 per cent. There were 15 (3.7 per cent) known recurrences. No complications from the anaesthetic were recorded. Owing to the negligible infection rate and the low surgical complication and recurrence rates it is concluded that children with inguinal hernia would benefit from operation as out-patients, and that they should be operated on immediately after diagnosis, irrespective of age. Besides probably minimizing the children's psychological trauma, out-patient surgery provided considerable savings to the health service in the present study.\r"

The data show native people suffered larger total body surface area (TBSA) burns, were hospitalized on average 16.9 days longer and required 0.7 more operations than their non-native counterparts. Natives are also three times more likely to remain within the health care system as inpatients for rehabilitation after acute burn management has been completed. Mortality rates as a result of these burns were similar for natives (4.8 per cent) and non-natives (4.3 per cent). This review indicates that the native population is at higher risk of suffering burn injury even after adjusting for certain demographic variables, consequently impacting the utilization of the health care system.\r"

The Burn Pain Questionnaire (BPQ) was used to assess the reported frequency of use and effectiveness of eight behavioural and seven cognitive coping strategies for average and severe levels of pain. The BPQ was also used to assess pain duration as a correlate of the efficacy of coping techniques. The results indicated that three behavioural techniques (listening to TV/radio/stereo, sleeping, talking about pain) and one cognitive technique (thinking about something else) were rated as effective by the majority of subjects for average levels of pain. None of the techniques were rated by subjects as useful with sever pain. Use of two behavioural approaches (use of TV/radio/stereo, talking) and two cognitive approaches (concentrating attention, imagining self elsewhere) were significantly correlated with increased pain duration. Results are discussed in terms of tailoring psychological pain control techniques to the individual needs of the patient.\r"

To symmetrical circular burns were inflicted on the back of 15 animals by aluminium templates. The Meshushit and its control vehicle containing 0.1 per cent gentamycin or the control vehicle plus antibiotic alone, were applied topically to randomly selected burns at equal time intervals. Epithelialization and contraction were assessed on postburn days 6, 10, 15, 18, 22 and 27 using a computerized planimeter. The newly formed granulation tissue was assessed histologically on postburn day 27, while the hair follicles were counted in the same sections. Student's t test was used to differentiate the rates of contraction and epithelialization; hair follicle counts and the thickness of the newly formed granulation tissue. None of the animals died during the experiment. The epithelialization and contraction rates did not differ significantly between the test groups. The Meshushit-treated wounds showed a significantly thicker granulation tissue layer as compared to its control (828.72 +/- 46.39 microns vs. 540.78 +/- 37.81 microns, P less than 0.01). The count of hair follicles was significantly higher in the Meshushit-treated burns (23.38 +/- 1.84 vs. 3.76 +/- 0.35, P less than 0.001). It is concluded that the herbal Meshushit ointment enhanced the newly formed granulation tissue and preserved better the hair follicles in the present burn wound model. It is suggested that these findings are due to the preservation of the dermal microcirculation.\r"

The study indicates that deep burns have the worst prognosis and that circumferential burns are always followed by secondary sequelae. The incidence of secondary hand deformity rises sharply when the burn affects more than 25 per cent of the total body surface area (TBSA). Given the same physical therapy programme, early tangential excision and immediate grafting yield better results than conservative treatment. The results underline the role of patient motivation in maximal hand rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1979 to January 1987, 125 patients were treated in our Centre for various electrical injuries. Among them, 85 patients were over 15 years of age (89.4 per cent were males and 10.6 per cent females) and 40 patients were below 15 years of age (92.5 per cent were males and 7.5 per cent females). Electricians were the most frequently injured in the over 15-year-old age-group, whereas most patients under 15 years old were students. We focused our study on five patients with multiple and severe electrical injury. Two of these patients were injured while erecting TV aerials, two were injured at work and the other one was working on a house roof. Despite all our efforts extensive limb amputations were required. Following complete healing, we fitted prostheses to the amputation stumps. All the patients have now returned to society as capable individuals, two of them to their previous occupations and the other three with new occupations. Our experience with five patients showed that patients with severe electrical injury and multiple amputations have a reasonable chance of recovery. Rehabilitation therapy must be given as early as possible after the electrical injury so that the patients may return to their normal place in society.\r"

One control per case, matched for sex, date of birth (within 5 years) and urologist, was chosen. Controls were patients who presented with hematuria and were shown not to have a urinary tract tumour. A total of 164 cases and 161 controls responded to mailed questionnaires and telephone interviews. Smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day was associated with the presence of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (p less than 0.001). Exposure to burning coal was associated with an increased relative risk of the disease but only when the exposure occurred between the ages of 10 and 24 years (p less than 0.05). Dose-response relations were demonstrated for intensity of exposure (p less than 0.025) and duration of occupational exposure (p less than 0.05). The distribution of latent periods from first exposure to diagnosis was bimodal, with one mode at 21 to 30 years and another at 41 to 50 years. Occupational exposure to tar or pitch or both was also associated with an increased relative risk of renal cell carcinoma (p less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "Advances in technology have improved the survival rates of infants of low birth weight. Increasing service commitments together with cutbacks in Canadian training positions have caused concerns about medical staffing in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Ontario. To determine whether an imbalance exists between the supply of medical personnel and the demand for health care services, in July 1985 we surveyed the medical directors, head nurses and staff physicians of nine tertiary level NICUs and the directors of five postgraduate pediatric residency programs. On the basis of current guidelines recommending an ideal neonatologist:patient ratio of 1:6 (assuming an adequate number of support personnel) most of the NICUs were understaffed. Concern about the heavy work pattern and resulting lifestyle implications has made Canadian graduates reluctant to enter this subspecialty. We propose strategies to correct staffing shortages in the context of rapidly increasing workloads resulting from a continuing cutback of pediatric residency positions and restrictions on immigration of foreign trainees.\r"

A total of 16% of all stool samples were positive. For each sample that was positive for a parasite (index sample) a search was done for other stool samples, positive or negative, received from the same patient within 6 days of reception of the index sample. We identified 676 sets of two (276) or three (400) samples of which at least 1 was positive. A total of 93% of the enteric parasites were detected in the first sample in the two-sample sets. Among the three-sample sets 90% of the parasites were detected in the first sample, 8% in the second and 2% in the third. We recommend waiting for the result from the first stool sample rather than routinely submitting three samples for recovery of enteric parasites.\r"
