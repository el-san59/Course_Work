All serum samples with neutralizing activity detected a 58-kDa protein that is the abundant component of the major glycoprotein complex of the envelope, suggesting that this protein complex is involved in the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Complement-independent neutralizing activity was found to develop later than complement-dependent activity, and no correlation was observed between complement-independent titers of neutralizing antibodies and antibody to the 86-kDa protein, which bears a complement-independent neutralizing epitope. Antibodies to the 66-kDa major tegument protein were present early after infection but were not correlated with serum neutralizing activity.\r"

Because these infections are rarely cured by passive administration of antibody, a chemotherapeutic approach would be advantageous. In this study, the efficacy of the antienterovirus (and antipicornavirus) drug disoxaril was demonstrated in a murine model of persistent enterovirus infection. Disoxaril is a hydrophobic antiviral compound that blocks picornavirus uncoating. The W-2 strain of human poliovirus type 2 (PV2) persists in the CNS of immunosuppressed mice and causes late paralysis. Mice were inoculated intracerebrally with PV2, immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, and treated intragastrically with disoxaril at 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg per day in two divided doses beginning on postinfection day 20. At 200 mg/kg per day, disoxaril significantly decreased the incidence of clinical disease, i.e., paralysis and death. Assays for virus revealed more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS in the drug-treated group. No drug-associated toxicity was observed. Residual isolates of virus were not drug-resistant, suggesting that the appearance of drug resistance during prolonged treatment may not be a clinical problem.\r"

Apart from P. pseudomallei, the spectrum of bacteria isolated from blood cultures and the overall mortality (32%) were similar to those previously reported elsewhere. Death from septicemia was associated with failure to develop a leukocytosis or pyrexia over 38 degrees C, azotemia, hypoglycemia, and jaundice. Septicemic melioidosis presented mainly in the rainy season, occurred predominantly in rice farmers or their families, and was significantly associated with preexisting diabetes mellitus or renal failure (P = .03). Blood-borne pneumonia and visceral abscesses were common and the mortality was high (68%; P less than .001). The response to appropriate treatment was slow (median fever clearance time 5.5 d) and the median duration of hospital stay was 4 w. Septicemic melioidosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in northeast Thailand.\r"

Therapy for bacteremia failed in two M patients, but bacteria persisted in 17 (10 S, 7 M) at the primary infection site. In 12 there was an anatomic or physiologic factor contributing to this persistence. One S patient showed mild nephrotoxicity, but ototoxicity was not found in any of the 35 patients who underwent serial audiography. Mild reversible rises of transaminases were found in 5 of 35 S patients and in 3 of 34 M patients. Once-daily administration of netilmicin seems to be as effective and as safe as conventional multiple daily doses.\r"

This hypothesis was investigated by means of an autoradiographic study of diffusion of labeled antibiotics into large infected cardiac vegetations of nutritionally variant Streptococcus endocarditis in rabbits. Ten days after infection, 653 microCi of [3H]penicillin, 410 microCi of [3H]tobramycin, or 174 microCi of [14C]teicoplanin were injected iv over 30 min. Thirty minutes after the end of infusion (T30), vegetation/blood radioactivity ratios were 2.48 +/- 1.27, 2.49 +/- 0.67, and 3.94 +/- 1.19 for penicillin, tobramycin, and teicoplanin, respectively. Autoradiography clearly showed that distribution of the three drugs was different: Tobramycin was homogeneously distributed; penicillin was more concentrated at the periphery but still reached the center of vegetations; teicoplanin was concentrated only at the periphery. The same distribution pattern was observed with teicoplanin at T120 (i.e., one t1/2 beta later) and also after simultaneous infusion of a therapeutic dose (15 mg/kg) of cold teicoplanin. The diffusion gradient exhibited by some antibiotics could explain the difficulty in sterilizing vegetations despite high local concentrations, and the deleterious effect of the size of the vegetations on the therapeutic response.\r"

One episode was followed by active pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Initial epidemiologic investigation implicated the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopes. In experiments, bronchoscopes and related equipment were exposed to a saline suspension of M. fortuitum (10(5)-10(7)/mL). Bronchoscopes were readily sterilized by routine cleaning and disinfection procedures, but the spring-operated suction valves remained contaminated, even after a 30-min exposure to 2% glutaraldehyde or after passage through a commercial bronchoscope washer. These results indicate that suction valves that have been heavily contaminated with mycobacterial organisms cannot be reliably disinfected with commercially available glutaraldehyde. Suction valves have since been routinely autoclaved after each use. No additional episodes of cross-contamination or infection have occurred over 24 mo of surveillance.\r"

The pattern of hormonal profile in relation to the number of oocytes retrieved, fertilized, and cleaved and the fate of the pregnancies achieved were compared in three groups of patients treated by the same protocol. Group I included 22 women who conceived with high progesterone levels on day hCG + 1 (P4, greater than 2.5 ng/ml). Group II included 43 women who conceived with low P4 values (P4, less than 2.5 ng/ml), while group III included 46 patients in whom no pregnancies occurred. A significant decrease in fertilization, cleavage, and pregnancy rates was observed in patients with high progesterone levels on day hCG + 1, compared to those with normal levels. Nevertheless, it is suggested that cycles with high P4 levels in the preovulatory phase should not be canceled, as a fair chance for pregnancy still exists.\r"

Experimentally, we have screened in a double-blind fashion the suppressive activity of human embryo culture media (B2 Menezo system, France) in which zygotes after decoronization were individually cultured during 24 hr on lymphocyte proliferation as well as natural killer (NK) activity. Suppressive activity in media from cleaved and uncleaved ova did not differ significantly, and activity in media from transferred embryos was not correlated significantly with successful pregnancy. The implications of these data are discussed.\r"

Echographic and laparoscopic oocyte retrieval gave similar results except for a higher fertilization rate after echographic-guided retrieval. For in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer an overall pregnancy rate of 26% per transfer was obtained. For GIFT and ZIFT the pregnancy rates were, respectively, 27.8 and 46.7% per replacement.

Forty-eight of these women were studied during natural cycles and 16 had mild oligoovulation and were administered clomiphene citrate (CC) to regulate their cycles. No patient received human chorionic gonadotropin. No patient was undergoing either in vitro fertilization (IVF) or gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT). Follicle puncture was performed and the oocytes were observed immediately for stage of maturation. Oocytes obtained from follicles exposed to CC were found to require an increased interval of time to reach metaphase I compared to oocytes obtained from natural cycles (27.75 +/- 2.2 vs 22.5 hr; mean +/- SE). Furthermore, the interval of time required for metaphase I oocytes to achieve metaphase II was statistically significantly shortened for CC cycles (2.4 hr for CC vs 10 hr for natural cycles. Nevertheless, there was no difference between natural and CC cycles in the time interval between LH surge onset and ovulation. These in vivo findings suggest a direct effect of CC on human oocyte maturation and may help explain the well-established discrepancy between the relatively high ovulation rate and the relatively low conception rate in clomiphene-induced cycles.\r"

In order to assess the validity of this assumption, the development in vitro of spare embryos was investigated. Eggs and embryos were cultured in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10% heat-inactivated patient's serum, and insemination was performed at 40 hr post human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). At 82-90 hr post hCG, up to four embryos were transferred. Any spare embryos were cultured in the same medium for up to 6 days and scored daily for cell number and morphology using a \"quality\" scale of 4-1 according to degree of fragmentation and shape of the blastomeres. Of 317 fertilized eggs, 55 (17%) developed to the fully expanded blastocyst stage. The remaining embryos ceased development at the one-cell (6; 2%), two-cell (49; 15%), four-cell (110; 35%), eight-cell (61; 19%), and cavitating morula (36; 11%) stages.

Binding to the hemizona was significantly higher for those having IVF success (mean of 36.1 +/- 7, versus 10.4 +/- 4 from the failure group; P less than 0.05). Fewer sperm from the failure group had a strictly normal morphology (3.2 versus 12.7%; P less than 0.05, Kruger method). Tight zona binding was significantly correlated with the percentage motile sperm, percentage normal morphology, and seminal sperm concentration. These results enhanced our confidence that the HZA is diagnostic for identification of patients at high risk of failing to achieve fertilization in vitro.\r"

The development of mouse embryos from the two-cell stage through the expanded blastocyst stage was facilitated significantly by the addition of supernatants of not only MLC, but also MLC supplemented with DCF (MLCDCF) to the culture medium. Moreover, the supernatant of MLCDCF accelerated the attachment of the hatched blastocyst to the culture dish substratum and the outgrowth of trophoblasts in vitro. The findings indicate that the supernatant of MLCDCF facilitates the in vitro activity of mouse embryos for implantation and that the maternal immune response, along with the decidual tissue, contributes to the implantation processes.\r"

  ".U": "89215517\r", 
  ".W": "Embryo implantation is dependent on the synchronous development of the embryo and of the endometrium. Pharmacologic doses of estrogens change endometrial histology and are known to inhibit implantation. During controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, such as occurs during an in vitro fertilization cycle, serum estradiol levels may be elevated to as much as three to six times those found during spontaneous cycles. Serum progesterone levels are also increased and may counteract the elevated estradiol levels. The overall effect of ovarian stimulation on implantation is therefore not known. To study this question, we developed a mouse embryo donation model. Donor embryos were obtained in the late morula to early blastocyst stage from hyperstimulated mated mice. The donated embryos were then transferred to the uteri of two groups of recipient mice. The study group underwent ovarian hyperstimulation with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (OHR group), while the controls were allowed to cycle spontaneously (SR group). All recipient mice underwent cervical stimulation to induce a pseudopregnant state. Five embryos were transferred to the left uterine horn of each of nine OHR mice and seven SR mice. A higher implantation rate was noted in the SR group than in the OHR group (50 +/- 12 vs 8 +/- 4%, P less than 0.001). Our data suggest that, in the mouse, ovarian hyperstimulation impedes implantation by causing adverse changes in uterine receptivity.\r"

The enzyme is found in both seminal fluid and spermatazoa. Three common phenotypes exist and can be identified in fluid specimens stored at 4 degrees C for more than a year. Untreated semen specimens display more than eight distinct bands of alpha-L-fucosidase activity with isoelectric points of pH 6.6 and below. Neuraminidase-treated specimens have enhanced banding patterns cathodally with a loss of activity in anodal bands making it easier to phenotype specimens. Semen stains maintained in dehumidified chambers at 25 or 37 degrees C retained activity for at least one month and could be accurately phenotyped. Activity was observed in semen specimens maintained at -20 degrees C in the dried state for a period of one year, whereas a complete loss of activity was observed after two weeks in similar specimens maintained at 25 or 37 degrees C under humid conditions. Of seventy-four semen stains analyzed, two had no apparent activity. Of the remaining seventy-two specimens 56, 32, and 12% were phenotyped as FUC 1-1, FUC 2-1, and FUC 2-2, respectively. Calculated gene frequencies are FUC1 = 0.72 and FUC2 = 0.28. Following analysis of alpha-L-fucosidase, the agarose gel can be chemically developed to reveal the PGM1 subtyping pattern. The ability to phenotype both systems in semen stains significantly improves the ability of the analyst to individualize this type of physical evidence. The probability of discrimination for these two combined systems is approximately 0.89.\r"

Correlation of autopsy findings or radiological information of these cervical injuries or both with scene investigation can be informative not only in the determination of morbidity and mortality, but also in the assessment of injury mechanisms and improvements in occupant protection.\r"

The American Psychiatric Association (APA), in its recently released \"Guidelines on Confidentiality,\" reaffirms this position. In an age of progressive erosion of the traditional psychiatrist-patient confidentiality, the threat to confidentiality is invariably perceived as exogenous, emanating from external sources such as the legal system, third-party payers, and peer review organizations. In rare instances, there appears to be a threat from within, when the psychiatrist (or nonpsychiatrist physician dealing with a psychiatric patient) deliberately chooses to divulge the patient's confidential communications in the absence of any clearcut legal requirement to do so (and against the express wishes of the patient). Four case examples of these unusual breaches of confidentiality are presented. The author concludes that although significant assaults on patient confidentiality are occurring from without, it is quite rare for such violations to come from within the profession itself.\r"

The applicability of these techniques to remains of fire victims has been uncertain because of possible cranial-base shrinkage that may result from burning. To determine the amount of shrinkage resulting from low-temperature burning (less than 800 degrees C), the cranial bases of eight dissecting room cadavers were measured, the bones then burned, and the cranial fragments remeasured. The wet-bone measurements were compared to the burned-bone measurements, and the percentage of shrinkage was calculated. The average change from wet to burned bone is less than 1.00%, a figure in agreement with other published studies. Since a change of 1.00% is less than intraobserver error, it is argued that low-temperature burning--such as an average house fire--does not significantly impair the accuracy of the identification techniques. Therefore, the techniques should be applicable to many fire victims.\r"

The MBD women had fewer alcoholic relatives, poorer relationships with parents and siblings, a more deviant score on CES and PAC, a higher incidence of nervous children, and a poorer social network. They also reported more losses and a greater frequency of depressive symptoms during childhood and adolescence, earlier contact with psychiatry, and more frequent hospitalizations. They had a higher frequency of a nonalcoholic axis I disorder (mainly depressive and anxiety disorders), as well as a greater frequency of a paranoid personality disorder. The results show that the MBD women were more psychopathologically disturbed and support a possible link between MBD and affective disorders.

  ".U": "89215846\r", 
  ".W": "T2-weighted MRI shows attenuated signals from the basal ganglia, such signal attenuation being more evident at high magnetic field strengths of 1.5 tesla (T). The basal ganglia contain high levels of iron, and it has been suggested that these iron deposits lead to shortening of bulk water T2 protons via a mechanism involving diffusion of water through local magnetic field gradients generated by the iron. This mechanism generates a relaxation contribution that is proportional to the square of the applied static field B0, and if it is significant the relaxation rate 1/T2 should be strongly dependent on Bo. T2-weighted MRI would then provide a potential means of imaging regional cerebral iron levels at field strengths that are high enough for this mechanism to be important. The bulk water proton spin-spin relaxation times (T2) of samples from caudate nucleus, frontal cortex, and white matter, taken from fresh cerebral necropsy material of four subjects dying of non-neurological conditions, and one subject with Parkinson's disease have been measured. T2 values were compared with regional cerebral iron content. At high field strengths (2.35 T and 8.5 T) no significant variation in regional cerebral water proton T2 values was found; caudate, cortex and white matter had similar water proton spin-spin relaxation times in spite of the variation in their iron content. Increasing the field strength from 2.35 T to 8.5 T resulted in a generalised 50% decrease in mean regional cerebral T2 values, as opposed to the 13-fold decrease expected if T2 relaxation was dominated by a mechanism that is dependent on B02.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overall, the percentage of Leu 2a cells correlated with alterations in the Leu 2a/15 suppressor sub-population (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001). Fewer circulating Leu 2a and Leu 2a/15 positive cells were identified in multiple sclerosis patients than unaffected individuals but there was no alteration in percentage of activated (Leu 2a/DR) CD8 cells. These findings suggest that the fluctuations in CD8 cells, characteristic of patients with multiple sclerosis, are due to alterations in T suppressor phenotype; this may then lower the threshold for activation of other T cell subpopulations.\r"

Scans were abnormal in 49 patients. New lesions had appeared on the second scan in nine individuals and in seven a single pre-existing lesion appeared to have become smaller but in no case were lesions seen to disappear. Two patients showed both reduction in the size of an abnormal area and development of a single new lesion indicating that corticosteroids do not appear rapidly to alter the process underlying plaque formation. Measurements of relaxation times were performed in 12 randomly selected patients. All showed elevated values in normal appearing white matter but not cortex before treatment compared with 18 healthy controls. After treatment a significant decrease of T1 and T2 was observed in cortex, and of T1 alone in normal appearing white matter. No significant change could be detected within lesions, a finding attributed to the wide range of relaxation values observed at these sites before treatment. Since brain water content is increased in normal appearing white matter of multiple sclerosis patients, and is significantly reduced by high-dose methylprednisolone, resolution of oedema may contribute to the rapid spontaneous or corticosteroid induced symptomatic recovery that characterises the disease in its early stages.\r"

This retinocochleocerebral syndrome has been reported previously only in 12 young North American women. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but an atypical viral infection of the vessel walls has been suggested. Abnormalities of T lymphocytes subsets in blood in one of the patients suggested an immunological dysfunction, but all other tests, including immunological reactions on brain and skin biopsies, were negative or non-specific. Steroids and immunosuppressive agents have been advocated on an empirical basis, but the second patient showed a substantial recovery without any therapy and the third gradually deteriorated despite azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone and plasma exchanges. This retinocochleocerebral syndrome probably corresponds to an arteriolopathy of unknown nature.\r"

Eye movements were recorded in the dark during sinusoidal and velocity step rotation. Four patients showed a significantly asymmetric response, with the slow phase of the VOR more active ipsilateral to the torticollis (chin). Despite significant improvement of the head posture in all patients for up to 10 weeks following treatment, no correction of the vestibular asymmetry occurred. This suggests that the VOR abnormalities are not caused by the head posture itself. We interpret the findings as evidence of primary involvement of the vestibular system in torticollis and we postulate a widespread derangement of the sensory-motor mechanisms controlling head posture in this disease.\r"

Those developing a frozen shoulder had initial disease symptoms indicative of akinesia twice as frequently as tremor while the ratio was reversed in those without frozen shoulder. In at least 8% of the patients frozen shoulder was the first symptom of disease, occurring 0-2 years prior to the onset of more commonly recognised features. Parkinson's disease should be added to the list of causes of frozen shoulder, and clinicians must be aware that the latter is often the presenting symptom of Parkinson's disease.\r"

It has previously been suggested that decline in duration of effectiveness of levodopa doses in Parkinsonian patients with motor oscillations is caused by loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic terminals with consequent reduction in striatal dopamine storage capacity. If this is true, duration of levodopa motor response should be shorter on the more severely affected body side in patients with asymmetrical disease, as loss of contralateral striatal dopamine storage capacity should be greater. Serial motor evaluations in 20 patients with asymmetrical Parkinson's disease failed to reveal any such asymmetry of duration of motor response to levodopa. It is suggested that striatal dopamine storage is not an important determinant of duration of clinical response to levodopa doses.\r"

Unified Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr, Schwab and England scores, number of hours on per day, number of hours of dyskinesia per day, daily dose of levodopa, and number of doses per day were monitored at the end of each treatment period and the results compared. The only significant difference in these parameters between the CR4 and standard Sinemet treatment periods in the entire group was a decrease in hours of dyskinesia per day. Two subgroups of CR4 responders were specifically examined. The first subgroup was characterised by a significant increase in on time per day with CR4 therapy. These patients had an older age of onset of Parkinson's disease and a shorter duration of disease and fluctuations than the rest of the patients. The second subgroup was characterised by the presence of dyskinesia with standard Sinemet therapy and a significant decrease in hours of dyskinesia per day with CR4 therapy. Both subgroups required a significantly higher daily dose of levodopa while on CR4. It is concluded that CR4 may be useful in increasing hours on per day in subgroups of Parkinson's disease patients who have less severe fluctuations. It may also be useful in decreasing the number of hours of dyskinesia per day.\r"

All patients had a profound disturbance of sensory perception in the ulcerated foot with complete loss of perception of warming; thresholds for vibration and cooling were highly abnormal in all but two patients. Measurements of thermal threshold were made on both feet in 10 patients: warming was lost bilaterally in all, and cooling was bilaterally absent in six. There was no clear pattern of sensory loss in those diabetics with unilateral foot ulceration to suggest that sensory impairment was the determining factor for the development of a plantar ulcer. Measurements of thermal thresholds were made at additional sites in 13 patients and although the most marked abnormalities of sensation were always found in the feet, in some severe neuropaths, abnormal thresholds on the hand and even the face were demonstrated. Thresholds for warming were invariably more abnormal than thresholds for cooling. The diabetics with neuropathic ulceration in this study all had severe generalised peripheral nerve disease involving large myelinated as well as both small myelinated and unmyelinated sensory fibres. The quantitative evidence on the distribution of sensory loss for thermal sensations supports the hypothesis that the neuropathic process affecting the small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres is length dependent.\r"

The heat evoked potentials had longer peak latencies (range: 280-350 ms) than those elicited by cold stimuli (range: 178-200 ms). A lower amplitude positive wave of a longer latency was also recorded to both modes of stimulation over the corresponding ipsilateral cortex. Cortical thermal evoked potentials were absent in two patients, one with severe selective small fibre neuropathy and the other with syringomyelia, both of whom had high thermal thresholds demonstrated by the technique of Jamal et al. Cerebral potentials evoked by thermal stimuli may represent an alternative approach to the investigation of the central projections of the human small fibre system with both clinical and research potential.\r"

Electromyographic recordings were taken from both mentalis muscles using concentric needle electrodes. Seventeen patients were investigated at various times after onset of idiopathic facial palsy (Bell's palsy). In the acute stage (less than 5 days after onset) short and long latency responses on the paretic side were abnormal, being absent in all but one patient, in whom the short latency response was delayed. These abnormal responses were the earliest neurographic correlate for nerve conduction block. In 4 out of 9 patients seen up to 30 days after onset of palsy, trans-synaptically evoked long latency responses were absent. In patients examined more than 2 months after onset, long latency responses could always be obtained and, in 5 of 8 patients, short latency responses could also be elicited, indicating a return of the direct excitability of the nerve. Five patients with cerebral hemisphere lesions causing mild unilateral facial weakness had absent long latency responses when stimulating over the affected hemisphere, but normal bilateral long latency responses following stimulation over the unaffected cerebral hemisphere; short latency responses were normal. Magnetic stimulation of the brain and of the facial nerve can differentiate between central and peripheral causes of unilateral facial weakness and may prove useful in the early assessment of the degree of conduction block in Bell's palsy.\r"

In 4 patients data on inheritance were compatible with the genetic pattern of autosomal recessive inheritance, while 3 patients were sporadic cases.

These findings were consistent with the pathology. The changes were more obvious in proton density-weighted images than in T2-weighted images, which thus differ from the changes in common gliosis. The other patient with the syndrome of PM and progressive ataxia did not show any olivary change. These changes on MRI are considered to indicate pseudo-hypertrophy of the inferior olives, although this is not consistently shown by the imaging method.\r"

Other PG metabolites, however, showed no significant changes in the ATD group.

All male patients displayed the known physical aspects of this syndrome together with associated abnormalities of the palate, skeleton, connective tissue and endocrine system. The most prominent neurological features were different forms of oculomotor disturbances, minor motor and pyramidal signs, incoordination, muscle hypotonia, gait and speech abnormalities. There was no increased frequency either in seizures or in epileptic EEG discharges. Some patients had a slowing of background activity in EEG. About 50% of all patients displayed autistic-like behaviour, short attention span and/or hyperactivity. In accordance with the literature, the findings indicate that there are no neurological, electroencephalographic or neuroradiological features which occur specifically in this syndrome. The need to differentiate the findings from those resulting from encephalopathic mechanisms during the gestational and perinatal period is stressed. A distinct typing of seizures and EEG changes is needed in each patient, before definite conclusions about an association of seizures and fra(X) syndrome are drawn. In view of the lack of correlation between IQ and the clinical-neurological measures, a more practical approach to quantifying the mental impairment is proposed.\r"

CoQ levels in muscle of patients with progressive muscular dystrophies, myositis or neurogenic atrophies were within the normal range.

Therefore, the effect of intravenous treatment was compared with long-term oral treatment over a period of 6 months. Clinical scores and psychometrically determined dexterity improved significantly during 10-day infusion therapy (200 mg amantadine sulphate/day). This improvement was successfully maintained by oral treatment (600 mg/day). A decrease in effectiveness was not observed. Reaction times were within the normal range for the age group involved and did not change significantly during the course of the study. Amantadine serum concentration during the infusion period ranged between 500 and 1000 micrograms/l and produced values nearly half as high as those obtained during oral treatment (600 mg/day). There was a constant relationship (quotient: 1.3) between serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentration. Considerable inter-individual variations were noted. A significant inter-individual correlation between serum concentration and clinical and psychological improvement was not discernible.\r"

As expected from theoretical considerations the haemodilution effect was short and not significant with Ringer's solution, but was 25% with HAES and 35% with dextrane 40. The corresponding rise in CBF was significant in both the latter but not with Ringer's solution. CBF was similarly highly correlated with diminution of haematocrit (Hct). The different effects of the substances on CBF could all be explained by their different effects on the Hct. Data analysis, together with recent literature, suggests that the dominating factor determining CBF was the O2-transport capacity, which in these experiments was in close relation to Hct. The results support the assumption that the increase of CBF by haemodilution is caused by a regulatory mechanism and not by a change of rheological parameters.\r"

CT at the onset of the symptoms demonstrated a small haemorrhage in the thalamus in one case but was not helpful in the others, and MRI was required to identify infarction. The anatomical sites responsible for the cheiro-oral syndrome have been reported to be in the central gyrus, in the thalamus, and in the brain stem. The clinical symptoms and signs reported in the literature and in our four cases are reviewed to evaluate aetiological factors and clinical features according to the three different sites of lesions causing this syndrome.\r"

Two patients with multiple infarctions had both symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions.

No significant relationship between race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, or smoking and the incidence of infarction was found by either univariate or multivariate analyses.\r"

  ".W": "There has been a renewed interest in the philosophical and scientific basis of epidemiology in recent years. In particular, it has been argued that Popper's philosophy should be adopted by epidemiologists, an assertion that has met with some scepticism. However, most criticisms of Popper's approach have been from an inductivist viewpoint, concerned with the generation of theories, whereas Popper's concern is with the testing of theories, and the two schools have been largely \"talking past each other\". We present a critique of Popper from within his own domain of interest. Examples are presented to show that Popper's philosophy is incomplete even for the physical sciences on which it is based, and that it is particularly inappropriate for epidemiology. Popper's approach makes sense only under the narrow way he has chosen to define science, and thus provides only a possible answer to a small set of fundamental problems of science and its use in society. The recent Popperian \"trend\" has a positive aspect in that it has fostered deductive thinking, and exposed the shortcomings of induction. However, the restrictive Popperian framework actually inhibits discussion despite its veneer of \"critical discussion\". A more pluralistic approach is needed at this stage of the development of epidemiology.\r"

Blood pressure was monitored among 341 subjects during control years and 309 subjects during intervention years. Analysis of blood pressure differences between early in the school year and near the end of the school year, with adjustment for sex and initial blood pressure, showed the effect of the dietary intervention to be -1.7 mmHg for systolic (95% CI = -0.6, -2.9, p = 0.003) and -1.5 mmHg for diastolic pressure (95% CI = -0.6, -2.5, p = 0.002). Such modest and easily attainable changes in sodium intake, if maintained, could have a significant effect on the future risk of essential hypertension among young people.\r"

The Survey of Work Styles (SWS), a self-report measure of the TABP, was developed using a construct approach to scale construction. It consists of six content scales. Impatience, Anger, Work Involvement, Time Urgency, Job Dissatisfaction and Competitiveness. In addition to the six content scales, a seventh scale, Scale A, is comprised of items empirically selected to relate to the Rosenman Structured Interview. In the present study the SWS was found to be significantly related to both the JAS, and the Framingham Type A Scale in a sample of 163 business managers. Median reliability of the SWS subscales was 0.82, and for the total scale 0.90. Discriminant function analysis using cross validational jackknifing procedures resulted in a classification accuracy of 83% of the Type A managers in relation to the Structured Interview. Classification using the SWS was found to correlate significantly higher with the Structured Interview than did either classification with the JAS or with the Framingham Type A Scale. Modal profile analysis yielded three independent bipolar typal dimensions, indicating that a single dimension or classification of the TABP represents an oversimplification of a complex behaviour pattern. These results support the reconceptualization of the TABP in terms of distinct facets and profile patterns.\r"

In each group, younger persons experienced greater percent declines than older persons. For stroke, non-smokers experienced a somewhat greater percent decline in rate than smokers but this did not hold true for all age groups. Unlike CHD, professionals experienced a smaller percent decline in their stroke death rate than non-professionals, as did persons with high SES compared to those with low SES. The contradictory patterns observed for the two diseases with respect to occupation and SES suggest that the risk factors for stroke and coronary heart disease are not exactly the same. Throughout, the findings were much more convincing for CHD than for stroke.\r"

Serum uric acid levels at baseline were strongly and significantly associated with all causes mortality in this cohort, with control for multiple risk factors and with exclusion of hypertensives on treatment. When the analysis was performed on age-specific groups 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64 years of age, the association was observed primarily in women in the oldest age group. All cardiovascular deaths, deaths due to coronary heart disease, and all cancer deaths were also associated with serum uric acid levels in the 55-64 year old group. The relationships persisted with control for multiple risk factors and with exclusion of treated hypertensives. A site-specific analysis of cancer deaths demonstrated elevations in mean serum uric acid levels for nearly all sites. Differences in mean serum uric acid levels between decedents and survivors tended to be largest in the first 5 years of follow-up for the cardiovascular deaths, but for cancer decedents they tended to be larger for subsequent years of follow-up. As an initial report on the association of serum uric acid and cancer in women in this age group, the results of this study require confirmation. Although hormonal influences may play a role, pathophysiologic mechanisms relating serum uric acid to mortality in white women aged 55-64 are currently unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Although a concensus has emerged in this country that patients should be told when cancer is discovered, no data is available to indicate how and where patients are currently told that they have cancer. Fifty-five patients undergoing anticancer therapy were therefore interviewed to learn how this process occurs. The majority of patients were told by surgeons (74%) and only a minority by primary care physicians (11%). Most were told in a traditional medical setting (42% in the doctor's office, 17% in a hospital room), but 23% were told over the telephone and 19% in the recovery room. Two indicators of patient satisfaction with the telling process suggested that different sites of telling were not equivalent. Patients told over the telephone or in the recovery room were more likely to describe the telling in negative terms and less likely to describe their doctors as being helpful in understanding their illness than those told in a doctor's office or in their hospital bed. This pilot study indicates considerable variation in this aspect of patient care and suggests directions for future research. To determine whether interviews that explore these issues with cancer patients are unpleasant or stressful, patients' reactions to being subjects in this study were sought. Patients asked directly at the completion of the interview or surveyed 2 to 4 months later said the interview had been helpful and/or a positive experience. None expressed negative feelings about participating. Concerns about the psychological harm resulting from such study of this patient group do not appear to be warranted and should not impede future research.\r"

  ".U": "89215953\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-seven men with symptomatic bone metastases from prostate cancer that had progressed following earlier treatment with estrogens and/or orchidectomy were treated with low-dose prednisone (7.5 to 10 mg daily). The rationale for this treatment was that some patients might still have hormone-sensitive disease that was stimulated by weak androgens of adrenal origin, and that these androgens could be suppressed by prednisone through its negative feedback on secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Response to treatment was assessed by requirement for analgesics, by the McGill-Melzack pain questionnaire, and by a series of 17 linear analog self-assessment (LASA) scales relating to pain and to various aspects of quality of life. Fourteen patients (38%) had improvement in indices used to assess pain at 1 month after starting prednisone, and seven patients (19%) maintained this improvement for 3 to 30 months (median, 4 months). Reduction in pain was associated with improvement in other dimensions of quality of life, and in the scale for overall well-being. Prednisone treatment led to a decrease in the concentration of serum testosterone in seven of nine patients where it was not initially suppressed below 2 nmol/L, and caused a decrease in serum levels of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in more than 50% of patients. Symptomatic response was associated with a decrease in serum concentration of adrenal androgens. We conclude that (1) low-dose prednisone may cause useful relief of pain in some patients with advanced prostatic cancer; (2) relief of pain was associated with suppression of adrenal androgens; and (3) measures of pain and quality of life can be used to assess possible benefits of systemic therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\r"

Staging procedures and chemotherapy treatment were uniform for all 429 patients. The diagnosis of combined histology was established via bronchoscopy (six patients), needle aspiration biopsy (one), lymph node biopsy (one), and thoracotomy (one). The clinical characteristics of the combined subtype patients were similar to patients with other subtypes of SCLC (ie, there were no differences in median age, sex, performance status, and stage of disease). However, patients with a combined subtype histology had a higher incidence of peripheral lesions on chest x-ray (56% v 14%, P less than .001) and a lower median lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (301 IU/L v 341 IU/L, P = .0002) at diagnosis. The overall response to chemotherapy (57% v 78; P = .5) and the median survival (8 months v 10 months; P = .4) of the combined subtype patients were similar to patients with other subtypes of SCLC. Two (22%) combined histology patients survived greater than or equal to 5 years. Both had had surgical resection in addition to chemotherapy. These data suggest that the combined subtype of SCLC is clinically similar to pure SCLCs and that surgery may play a prominent role in the management of these tumors. The possibility of a combined histology tumor should be considered in patients thought to have SCLC on the basis of limited biopsy material, such as a needle aspiration or bronchial biopsy, and when the primary lesion is peripherally located on chest x-ray.\r"

To date there are no published data to indicate whether the persistence of pigmentation can be predicted beforehand or if it has any prognostic import. We reviewed the response to treatment of 118 EKS lesions that were irradiated at New York University (NYU) Medical Center between 1981 and 1986. A total of 86 responded to treatment by complete clearance of the mass. Of these, 29 left residual purple pigmentation within the treatment portal, while 57 did not. Complete response (CR; without residual pigmentation) occurred more often in patients who had higher Karnofsky scores at the time of treatment. However, in terms of ultimate local control or survival, there were no differences between patients whose lesions cleared completely v those in whom pigmentation remained. We conclude that persistent pigmentation represents only a benign remnant of irradiated EKS and has no prognostic import.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that the steady-state concentration of intracellular cytarabine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTPss) in leukemia cells is proportional to the dose rate of cytarabine (ara-C) during continuous infusion. To evaluate this possibility, patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in relapse were treated with two sequential schedules of serially increasing ara-C dose rates over a total of 36 hours. Schedule I consisted of serial infusions of 250, 500, and 750 mg/m2 each over 12 hours. Subsequently, patients entered on schedule II received 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg/m2 serially, each over 12 hours. Steady-state levels of ara-CTP were achieved within four hours after beginning ara-C infusion and, in separate studies of a single ara-C dose rate, were shown to be maintained beyond 36 hours. Four patients treated with schedule I and two patients treated with schedule II showed a linear dose rate-dependent increase-of ara-CTPss at all three dose rates. The cells of one patient on schedule I and two patients on schedule II had a dose rate-dependent ara-CTPss increase only over the first two dose levels, while no increase or lower ara-CTPss was observed at the third dose rate. The ara-CTPss of one patient on schedule II did not change. These results suggest that there is a proportionality between the continuous infusion dose rate of ara-C and the ara-CTPss in circulating leukemia cells within the dose range of 250 to 1,000 mg/m2 over 12 hours. This opens the possibility that pharmacologic determinations may be used to redirect the ara-C dose rate to achieve a desired ara-CTPss level in leukemia blasts during therapy.\r"

The maximum-tolerated intraarterial (IA) dose (MTD) was 1,333 mg/m2/d administered continuously for 14 days. The dose-limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were correlated with the amount of IdUrd incorporated into DNA of peripheral granulocytes. In contrast to our experience with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, there was no evidence of hepatobiliary toxicity. In 11 patients who received IA IdUrd alone, seven had a greater than or equal to 50% decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with five having tumor volume reductions of 65%, 48%, 46%, 44%, and 27%. Thus, IA IdUrd alone has antitumor efficacy. Patients subsequently received IdUrd in combination with external beam radiation to a total dose of 2,400 cGy without acute local toxicity. In addition to these favorable clinical findings, we have previously shown that IdUrd is selectively incorporated into tumor DNA compared with normal liver in these patients. Further phase II evaluations of this approach are warranted.\r"

The hippocampus, removed en bloc, was studied histologically and the pathology was correlated with the electrophysiological findings. In 29 of the patients, entorhinal stimulation evoked a characteristic positive-negative potential in the hippocampus. The entorhinal-evoked hippocampal response closely resembled, or was identical to, the spontaneously occurring hippocampal interictal spike discharge. In patients with Ammon's horn sclerosis in whom there was a major loss of neurons in the hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3, and CA4, the evoked responses were of simple morphology and long latency (mean 21.9 msec to the peak of the first potential). In patients with a ganglioglioma in whom the hippocampus was histologically normal, the evoked responses were of greater complexity and shorter latency (mean 11.8 msec). Stimulation at a single entorhinal site evoked similar waveforms at different hippocampal recording sites. Conversely, stimulation at different entorhinal sites evoked similar responses at a single hippocampal recording site. Stimulation of the hippocampus evoked a potential in the entorhinal cortex and, in some instances, in the amygdala, insula, and lateral temporal cortex. These connections may produce a positive feedback loop that favors seizure generation.\r"

  ".U": "89215992\r", 
  ".W": "This investigation evaluated the possibility that the occurrence of S-antigen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) might be used as a preoperative marker of pineal parenchymal tumors (pineoblastoma and pineocytoma). Such a marker could provide a means of preoperatively differentiating these neoplasms from pineal region tumors of other origin. The S-antigen, also known as the 48-kD protein or arrestin, is a highly antigenic protein originally found in the retina and pineal gland. In the retinal photoreceptors and submammalian pineal photoreceptors the protein is thought to be involved in phototransduction; its function in the mammalian pinealocyte is unknown. S-Antigen immunoreactivity also occurs in certain neoplastic cells of retinoblastomas, pineocytomas, pineoblastomas, and cerebellar medulloblastomas. This study included a group of 13 patients with tumors of the pineal region. Samples of CSF were obtained preoperatively and analyzed for the S-antigen using western blot technology. Tumor biopsy material was classified according to conventional neurohistological criteria and was also examined by immunocytochemical techniques for the presence of the S-antigen. S-Antigen immunoreactivity was found in the preoperative CSF of the one patient found to have pineocytoma; tumor tissue removed from this patient was the only neoplastic tissue examined in this study which contained S-Antigen immunoreactive tumor cells. Furthermore, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity was detectable in the pineocytoma but not in three other pineal tumors, and melatonin levels in the CSF of the pineocytoma patient were the highest in the patient group examined. These preliminary results suggest that testing for S-antigen in CSF might be useful in characterizing and treating tumors of the pineal region and, when identified in conjunction with other markers, it might also help to better define pineal parenchymal tumors. This study needs confirmation with a larger number of patients. If this approach is eventually found to be a reliable predictor of pineal cell tumors, it may supplant the need for surgical biopsies before initiating appropriate adjunctive therapy.\r"

For the entire group, the median time to tumor progression (TTP) was 59 weeks (adults 66 weeks, children 44 weeks) and the median survival time was 74 weeks (adults 92 weeks, children 64 weeks). Statistically significant prognostic factors associated with a decrease in TTP and median survival times (adults less than children) were: patient's age, a clinical history of less than 2 months, widespread brain-stem dysfunction, and a diffuse tumor as seen on magnetic resonance imaging. A finding of glioblastoma multiforme at histological analysis was associated with a statistical trend toward poorer survival, but in general tumor histology was not predictive of outcome. No evidence of an increase in acute or delayed radiation toxicity was seen with this fractionation schedule and total dose. This study suggests that hyperfractionation prolongs the TTP and survival time for many patients with brain-stem glioma. However, there remains a group of patients who are only moderately helped by this technique and for whom more aggressive treatment is warranted.\r"

Patients undergoing surgical removal of gliomas were given a 30-minute intravenous infusion of BUdR (150 to 200 mg/sq m) to label S-phase tumor cells. The tumor specimens were stained immunohistochemically for BUdR and processed for routine histopathological diagnosis. The BUdR LI was calculated as the percentage of labeled cells among cells analyzed. Twenty-seven histological features in three categories (degenerative, vascular, and cellular changes) were considered. A significantly higher BUdR LI (p less than 0.05) was found in tumors with necrosis than in those without this feature; tumors with both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis had the highest BUdR LI (p less than 0.05). Increased vascularity was also associated with a higher BUdR LI (p less than 0.05). Although tumors with abnormal mitotic figures had a significantly higher BUdR LI than those without, the number of mitoses did not correlate with a higher BUdR LI. These results suggest that the number of mitoses is not a good indicator of tumor growth rate. Necrosis and increased vascularity should be heavily weighted in predicting the proliferative potential of individual gliomas.\r"

  ".U": "89215996\r", 
  ".W": "As survival rates have risen for children with malignant primary brain tumors, so has the concern that many survivors have significant permanent cognitive deficits. Cranial irradiation (CRT) has been implicated as the major cause for cognitive dysfunction. To clarify the etiology, incidence, and severity of intellectual compromise in children with brain tumors after CRT, a prospective study was undertaken comparing the neuropsychological outcome in 18 consecutive children with malignant brain tumors treated with CRT to outcome in 14 children harboring brain tumors in similar sites in the nervous system who had not received CRT. Children with cortical or subcortical brain tumors were not eligible for study. Neuropsychological testing was performed after surgery prior to radiotherapy, after radiotherapy, and at 1- and 2-year intervals thereafter. Children who had received CRT had a mean full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) of 105 at diagnosis which fell to 91 by Year 2. Similar declines were noted in their performance intelligence quotient (IQ) and verbal IQ. After CRT, patients demonstrated a statistically significant decline from baseline in FSIQ (p less than 0.02) and verbal IQ (p less than 0.04). Children who had not received CRT did not demonstrate a fall in any cognitive parameter over time. The decline between baseline testing and testing performed at Year 2 in patients who had CRT was inversely correlated with age (p less than 0.02), as younger children demonstrated the greatest loss of intelligence. Children less than 7 years of age at diagnosis had a mean decline in FSIQ of 25 points 2 years posttreatment. No other clinical parameter correlated with the overall IQ or decline in IQ. After CRT, children demonstrated a wide range of dysfunction including deficits in fine motor, visual-motor, and visual-spatial skills and memory difficulties. After CRT, children with brain tumors also demonstrated a fall in a wide range of achievement scores and an increased need, over time, for special help in school. The 2-year results of this study suggest that children with brain tumors treated with CRT are cognitively impaired and that these deficits worsen over time. The younger the child is at the time of treatment, the greater is the likelihood and severity of damage. These children, although not retarded, have a multitude of neurocognitive deficits which detrimentally affects school performance. New treatment strategies are needed for children with malignant brain tumors.\r"

However, no study has established lasting benefit from this procedure or determined the incidence of recanalization, as occurs with cerebral AVM's. In this study, six patients were followed periodically after complete obliteration of their AVM's by particulate embolization was shown by immediate arteriography. The study group included three men (aged 59 to 72 years) with spinal dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and three women (aged 27 to 38 years) with intramedullary glomus-type spinal cord AVM's. The patients were treated by embolization with 100- to 1000-microns diameter polyvinyl alcohol particles. Clinical improvement, most commonly manifesting as increased lower-extremity strength, occurred in all patients after embolization. However, recurrent symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and urinary incontinence, occurred within 2 and 8 months in two of the three patients with dural AV fistulas and within 2 months in two of the three patients with glomus AVM's, prompting radiological reevaluation. Spinal arteriography revealed recanalization of the AV fistulas and spinal AVM's in five patients. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a signal-void area caused by intramedullary AVM's. This area disappeared after embolic occlusion, but recurred after delayed recanalization, indicating restored flow through the AVM. Embolization provides only temporary treatment for many spinal AVM's. After embolic occlusion, delayed reassessment with arteriography and/or MR imaging is indicated, particularly if the symptoms persist or recur. Surgical excision of spinal AVM's provides the only therapeutic means to eliminate flow through the AVM permanently in most patients, and should be considered the treatment of choice when feasible.\r"

A series of 13 patients with syringohydromyelia delineated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was reviewed, and the intracranial pressure (ICP) and lumbar spinal pressure (LSP) were recorded concomitantly in three patients. Lumboperitoneal shunting was performed in seven patients, six of whom also underwent myelotomy of the caudal spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging visualized a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) channel connecting the fourth ventricle with the syrinx in only one of the 13 patients, and in the remaining 12 patients it revealed a long segment of the spinal cord free of syrinx below the fourth ventricle. This finding is in accordance with recent MR studies of syringohydromyelia. The concomitant recording of ICP and LSP in our patients who had myelomeningocele and Chiari II malformation showed findings contradicting the reports of Williams. Lumbar spinal pressure was equal to ICP under steady-state conditions, and was elevated by straining or crying more markedly than ICP. Craniospinal pressure dissociation with ICP greater than with LSP, as described by Williams, was not observed. Lumboperitoneal shunting concomitant with myelotomy and syringopleural shunting 1 month after myelotomy resulted in marked and sustained shrinkage of the syrinx and neurological improvement in four patients. It was concluded that the majority of patients with syringohydromyelia and Chiari malformation lack a direct communication connecting the fourth ventricle with the syrinx. The results suggest that CSF moves under pressure into the spinal cord, contributing to the formation and maintenance of the syrinx, and that LP shunting combined with myelotomy can effect shrinkage of the syrinx.\r"

The lesion was a direct arteriovenous fistula in a dilated vein of Galen and was treated by complete embolization in one session. Four months after occlusion of the shunt, the ectatic vein of Galen and torcular were normal, and the head circumference had stabilized. This case serves as an opportunity to emphasize the quality of results that can be obtained with endovascular techniques. Proper analysis of the vein of Galen angioarchitecture allows planning for appropriate treatment with the lowest possible risk of morbidity and mortality.\r"

In each case, angiograms had shown that the AVM's were supplied from both internal and external carotid arteries, which was thought to render complete transarterial embolization difficult. A No. 2.5 French Teflon catheter was introduced into the affected cavernous sinus through the superior ophthalmic or internal jugular vein with the aid of a flexible mini guide wire. Copper wires were pushed by the guide wire into the cavernous sinus until the disappearance or a sufficient decrease in the arteriovenous shunt was noted. The patients' symptoms resolved or improved without any severe complications. Angiography revealed complete disappearance of the lesion immediately after treatment in three cases and follow-up angiography taken within 8 months showed no arteriovenous shunt in any patient. This method is a promising treatment for dural AVM's when conventional transarterial embolization is thought to be difficult.\r"

The underlying systemic hemodynamic changes were also observed. To produce a standardized head injury, a fluid-percussion device was applied to the dura at the midline of 10 piglets. Seven other nontraumatized animals served as a control group. Hemodynamic parameters as well as ICP and CPP were recorded on-line, one value every 1.4 seconds. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) were measured three times using a microsphere technique. Immediately after head injury, the traumatized animals showed a sudden increase in ICP, with a maximum of 40 torr at 3 to 5 minutes, while there was a pronounced decrease in CPP from 85 to 40 torr. The CBF in the various brain areas fell from 55 to 22 ml/min/100 gm within 5 minutes after the impact, and CVR increased to 300% of control values within 90 minutes. The findings of this study demonstrated that cerebral circulation is critically jeopardized within a few minutes after trauma. This, in combination with a subsequent increase in CVR, makes the early development of ischemic brain damage very likely. In traumatized patients, treatment prior to hospital admission must therefore be directed at prevention of this fatal course.\r"

Regional spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured at five vertebral levels in the spinal cords of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats based on the distribution of intravenously injected carbon-14-labeled butanol. In seven normal rats, mean SCBF (+/- standard error of the mean) ranged from 52.7 +/- 5.4 to 68.5 +/- 4.9 ml.min-1.100 gm-1 (depending on the level, being lowest at the thoracic levels) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was 126 mm Hg. Corporal hypothermia (mean rectal temperature 28.1 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C) was induced by cold exposure in seven other rats, and SCBF, measured immediately thereafter, was significantly elevated at all five levels by 52% to 69% compared to the normal group. However, MABP was elevated in the hypothermic group to 165 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Therefore, in seven additional hypothermic rats, MABP was maintained at the control level by withdrawal of arterial blood as necessary. In these animals, SCBF at all levels was still significantly elevated compared with the normal group and the values were nearly identical to those measured in the hypertensive hypothermic rats. It was concluded that hemodynamic autoregulation of SCBF is impaired in the presence of moderate systemic hypothermia in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats.\r"

Furosemide administered to newborn pups induced a diuresis that resulted in a 11% to 22% loss in body weight and a concomitant decline in muscle water (13% to 16%) and sodium (18% to 21%). Paradoxically, no change occurred in the water or electrolyte content of the brain even though cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue pressure, but not blood pressure, declined. These changes were absent in littermates treated with saline. Microscopic examination of brain sections revealed a greater incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in the germinal matrix and choroid plexus, in furosemide-treated than in saline-treated preterm rabbit pups. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intracranial hypotension promotes the incidence of GH-IVH in preterm animals.\r"

The arteries of animals maintained on a cholesterol-rich (1%) diet for 6 months had more pronounced intimal lesion than those receiving the diet for 3 months. The aortas were more severely damaged than the carotid or basilar arteries. Segments of the arteries were mounted in organ chambers for isometric tension recording or for measurement of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Endothelium-independent relaxation induced by glyceryl trinitrate was not affected even in the most severely damaged arteries; endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and A23187 was progressively inhibited as the degree of fatty streak formation increased. In the carotid arteries, mean (+/- standard deviation) relaxation induced by 10(-5) M of ACh (expressed as a percentage of the maximum relaxation induced by 10(-4) M of papaverine) decreased from 87.33% +/- 6.30% in control tissues to 60.90% +/- 4.64% in vessels from animals subjected to 6 months of hypercholesterolemia (p less than 0.01); in the aortas, mean relaxation due to 10(-5) M of ACh was 85.08% +/- 8.03% in control tissues and 41.35% +/- 13.68% in hypercholesterolemic tissues (p less than 0.01). In the carotid arteries, mean relaxation induced by 10(-7) M of A23187 decreased from 95.81% +/- 3.58% in control tissues to 55.95% +/- 2.81% in hypercholesterolemic tissues (p less than 0.01); in the aortas, relaxation in response to 10(-7) M of A23187 was 73.73% +/- 4.35% in control tissues and 29.35% +/- 6.77% in hypercholesterolemic tissues (p less than 0.01). Intimal lesions were not produced in the basilar arteries even in rabbits with 12 months of hypercholesterolemia, and endothelium-dependent relaxation was preserved.\r"

Drainage of an arachnoid cyst of the optic nerve sheath improved visual acuity to 20/25. Computerized axial tomography disclosed the hemorrhage in the first case and enlargement of the optic nerve sheath in the second. While the management of traumatic optic neuropathy is controversial, surgical intervention for an arachnoid cyst and hematoma involving the optic nerve is clearly beneficial.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful diagnostic tool for its evaluation. Terminal myelocystocele consists of the following: a myelocystocele which contains a \"trumpet-like\" flaring of the distal spinal cord central canal and thus is partially lined by ependymal tissue; a meningocele or dilated subarachnoid space located around the myelocystocele, which bulges into the subcutaneous region; and fibrolipomatous tissue surrounding the two cysts. This condition is usually associated with abnormalities of the vertebral column and sacrum as well as compression of the spinal cord and meningocele by a fibrous band. There is a possible relationship of the myelocystocele to teratogens such as loperamide HCl and retinoic acid, although the exact etiology of this entity is not known.\r"

The CHQ was tested in a controlled trial of digoxin in heart failure patients in sinus rhythm. When administered serially to 25 patients in the run-in phase of the trial, the CHQ proved reproducible. Subsequently, CHQ results distinguished those who reported improvement or deterioration from those who did not. The CHQ showed moderate correlations with patient global ratings, walk test scores, and clinical assessments of heart failure. The authors conclude that the CHQ may be useful for measuring health status in clinical trials in heart failure.\r"

A videotape of each interview was analyzed at the National Board of Medical Examiners using the interaction analysis system for interview evaluation, ISIE-81, to define house officers' interviewing techniques. From the physicians' problem-solving perspective, data elicitation was positively related to the length of the interview, asking psychosocial questions, the use of narrow questions, and the amount of time the patient talked. The patients' assessments of house officers' data-gathering thoroughness were also positively influenced by interview length, the use of narrow questions, and inquiries about their psychosocial histories. The use of broad questions by the house officer was positively related to the patient's feelings about and reaction to the interaction. This study potentially explains some of the differences that appear to exist between patients' and physicians' judgments about and perceptions of the medical interviewing process.\r"

DESIGN: The study used a non-concurrent control group design which randomized subjects into two groups before the intervention. The two groups completed different pre-tests; each group then completed the other group's pre-test as its post-test. The post-course scores of one group were compared with the pre-course scores of the other group to establish differences. SETTING: The research was conducted at the 1985 faculty development course sponsored by the SGIM Task Force on the Medical Interview. PARTICIPANTS: 49 of 52 teachers of medical interviewing attending the course completed the study. INTERVENTION: The week-long intervention consisted of a variety of educational activities which assisted the participants in defining and actively pursuing their learning objectives in interviewing, teaching, and self-awareness. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In their assessment of two videotaped segments of initial medical visits, participants were more likely after the course to comment on the interviewer's lack of attention to patient affect (69.0% versus 27.2%, p = 0.005 in one segment) and somewhat more likely to identify teaching strategies that actively involved the interviewer (47.2% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.09 in one segment). Both shifts were congruent with assessments made by course faculty. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty development can influence teachers to recognize the need to provide feedback on skills that expert teachers would emphasize. The non-concurrent control group design provides an innovative approach to common constraints in evaluating faculty development courses.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether current therapies are useful in preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by analysis of study designs and pooled results. Design: Meta-analysis of all controlled studies investigating PHN prevention in the immunocompetent host. Articles were identified through MEDLINE, Index Medicus and bibliographic reviews of major texts and review articles. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were independently assessed using explicit methodologic criteria for validity and generalizability in clinical trials. Pooled analysis was also performed where appropriate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one investigations met eligibility criteria and primarily addressed the use of antiviral agents and corticosteroids. Among studies with strong designs, no evidence of benefit was found for acyclovir or corticosteroids. Pooled results showed no significant effect of acyclovir on the prevention of PHN (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.56, 1.11). The strongest studies that found potential efficacy in PHN prevention involved adenosine monophosphate and idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, but problems with clinical application limit the use of these compounds. Outcome definition, compliance assessment, power estimation, and method of randomization were infrequently addressed aspects of design. CONCLUSION: Currently there is no proven useful therapy for the prevention of PHN. The benefits of acyclovir and corticosteroids are limited but key questions remain regarding these medications. A clear consensus definition of PHN is needed to improve future investigations.\r"

Fourteen had single-jaw operations, and the remaining 11 had concomitant maxillary procedures. Cephalometric radiographs were reviewed preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and 6 months to 3 years after surgery. Relapse was defined as forward movement of pogonion during the postoperative period. No difference in the movement of the mandible in one- or two-jaw cases was noted. Even with excellent occlusal results, there was a tendency for the mandible (chin point) to rotate forward. In the one-jaw cases 43.7% relapse was noted, whereas 53.4% was seen in the two-jaw cases. A regression analysis showed that the magnitude of setback was the single factor that significantly predicted relapse in one-jaw cases, whereas alteration of the proximal segment accounted for relapse in two-jaw procedures. These results seem interrelated when considering alterations in the spatial arrangement of the muscular tissues and their attachments.\r"

Larger changes in occlusal force than could be accounted for by the altered geometry were observed in all groups. Of 15 patients who had only superior repositioning of the maxilla, ten had greater than 20% increase in occlusal force, three had little change, and two showed a greater than 20% decrease. When the mandible was advanced, 11 of 34 patients had greater than 20% increase in maximum biting force, 11 had little or no change, and 12 had greater than 20% decrease. When the mandible was set back, six of the 21 patients had greater than 20% increase, nine had little or no change, and six had greater than 20% decrease. It appears that considerable change in bit force, which is not primarily related to jaw geometry, occurs after orthognathic surgery.\r"

Using a within-subject, crossover experimental design, this study compared the analgesic efficacies of an NSAIA, diflunisal 1,000 mg, administered either 30 minutes preoperatively or 30 minutes postoperatively to 20 patients undergoing the removal of impacted third molars. Pain intensity was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for eight hours using category-rating and visual analog scales. Treatment with diflunisal 30 minutes after completion of surgery proved to be just as effective in suppressing postsurgical pain as presurgical administration. Administration of an NSAID in the immediate postoperative period may be indicated for optimum postoperative analgesia for patients in whom preoperative oral intake is contraindicated.\r"

  ".W": "Using an extraoral approach, subperiosteal pockets were created bilaterally over the zygomatic and mandibular regions in six Rhesus monkeys. One side of each animal received a Proplast I (Vitek Inc, Houston) implant and the contralateral side received an equivalent sized block of porous hydroxyapatite (HA). The animals were followed clinically and radiographically. Two animals were killed postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The implants were retrieved en bloc and halved. Half of each specimen was decalcified, embedded in paraffin, and stained. The other half was embedded in plastic, and sections were stained or carbon-coated for histometry scanning under electron microscopy. Clinical evaluation revealed that porous HA implants were more stable than Proplast implants. The Proplast implants showed complete encapsulation by infiltration with fibrovascular connective tissue, and progressive fragmentation with giant cell reactions. The porous HA implants were united to the underlying cortex by bony ingrowth. The volume of implants sampled within 2.5 mm of the underlying cortex contained 42.5% HA matrix and 23.8% bony ingrowth, and the surface area of the HA matrix (9.7 mm2/mm3) was 47.8% covered by bony ingrowth. No giant cell response, fragmentation, or biodegradation was observed or measured in the porous HA implants. The data from this primate model further substantiate previous canine studies and permit more reliable estimation of clinical performance. These results provide comparative data that can contribute to the decision-making process in selecting clinical implants.\r"

This study compared 24-hr profiles of plasma gastrin levels associated with three different compounds at equivalent, highly effective antisecretory doses. Ranitidine, famotidine and omeprazole at 60, 20 and 40 mg/kg p.o., respectively, inhibited basal acid secretion of chronic gastric fistula rats by greater than 95% and raised intraluminal pH to above 7.0 for 5 hr. The peak plasma gastrin levels associated with each agent were observed 5 hr after dosing. Ranitidine, famotidine and omeprazole induced statistically significant and distinct peak hypergastrinemic responses of 312 +/- 20, 483 +/- 28 and 616 +/- 27 pg/ml, respectively. After 8 hr ranitidine and famotidine associated gastrin values returned to control levels, whereas those of omeprazole remained substantially above control values until the 12th hr. Differences in peak gastrin levels between compounds disappeared at increased dose levels of 500 mg/kg for ranitidine, 200 or 2000 mg/kg for famotidine and 140 mg/kg for omeprazole. Unlike high dose famotidine, omeprazole (140 mg/kg) maintained peak plasma gastrin levels at 8, 12, and 16 hr after dosing. These studies demonstrate clearly hypergastrinemic responses to single dose administration of ranitidine, famotidine and omeprazole. The differences observed in peak plasma gastrin levels at equivalent antisecretory doses of these agents suggests the presence of luminal acid independent components that effect gastrin release. Moreover, these studies indicate that, in the rat, the most unique aspect of omeprazole-associated hypergastrinemia is the magnitude of its prolonged response.\r"

After completion of the first \"procurement component\" response requirement, access to food, i.e., a meal, became available under the second \"consumption component\" during which each response produced a 1-g food pellet. After 10 min in which no response occurred, the consumption component was terminated. When given p.o. 45 to 60 min before the start of the daily session, anorectic drugs, with the exception of (+/-)-phenylpropanolamine, produced dose-dependent decreases in food intake, with the following order of potency: phentermine greater than mazindol greater than diethylpropion greater than phendimetrazine = chlortermine = phenmetrazine = chlorphentermine. Feeding topography was differentially affected by drug administration. The latency to the first meal was increased by all of the drugs except chlorphentermine. Only diethylpropion, phendimetrazine and mazindol decreased the number of daily meals, whereas only diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, phenmetrazine and clortermine decreased the size of the first meal. Mazindol was the only anorectic drug tested that did not decrease intake during the first 8 hr of the session. (+/-)-phenylpropanolamine did not decrease food intake in the tested dose range. Phencyclidine, by decreasing intake during the first 8 hr, but not the entire 22-hr session, affected feeding topography differently than the anorectic drugs. In contrast to anorectic drug administration, decreases in food intake after phencyclidine administration were followed by caloric compensation for this initial decrease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of rat uterine myometrial muscarinic receptors with a variety of agonists results in increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Activation with carbachol is concentration- and time-dependent and is most apparent by following the accumulation of inositol monophosphate although there are small but significant increases of inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate. Carbachol stimulation of phospholipid turnover is greatest in the upper third of the uterus. The carbachol-induced increase of inositol monophosphate is antagonized by atropine and by the selective M-3 muscarinic receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide. Pirenzepine, a selective M-1 receptor antagonist is less active, whereas gallamine and 11-2[[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one, selective M-2 receptor antagonists, are minimally effective suggesting that muscarinic M-3 receptors modulate phospholipid turnover in the rat myometrium. Displacement of tritium-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding by muscarinic antagonists also supports the presence of M-3 receptors in the uterus. Incubation with phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate significantly reduced the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by carbachol implying that protein kinase C might modulate the responsiveness of the M-3 receptors in the rat uterus. Our results suggest that the intracellular concentration of calcium required for the contraction of the rat myometrium may be modulated, in part, through M-3 muscarinic receptors coupled to phospholipase C-activated turnover of phosphoinositides.\r"

The first-order kinetic model does not accurately describe the kinetics of dopamine in these patients based on the finding that clearance varied as a function of concentration. A saturable protein binding model is described and provides a more accurate description of the behavior of the data. Using multivariate analysis, changes in dopamine kinetics were found as a function of weight. Furthermore, the co-administration of dobutamine altered the kinetics of dopamine. These data support the use of free dopamine concentrations rather than total concentration for studies of dopamine pharmacokinetics. Evaluation of total clearance of dopamine is of limited value, and changes in protein binding and intrinsic clearance must be considered in future studies of this drug.\r"

Exposure to FT schedule values greater than 1 min (3 and 5 min) resulted in greater milliliter per pellet intakes of midazolam than of water, perhaps reflecting the reinforcing efficacy of the drug. To determine if drugs with unequivocal reinforcing efficacy display similar elevations at the larger FT values, solutions of cocaine and ethanol, but also of the equivocally reinforcing agents chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam, as well as water, were offered to groups of rats at concentrations isoacceptable under FT 1-min schedule-induction conditions. Under the FT 1-min schedule, separate groups of rats drank equal and excessive amounts of water, cocaine (0.15 mg/ml), ethanol (2.5% v/v), chlordiazepoxide (0.25 mg/ml) and flurazepam (0.175 mg/ml). Differential group milliliter per pellet intakes occurred under larger FT values: ethanol, cocaine and midazolam yielded greater values than water, chlordiazepoxide or flurazepam. Schedule-induced drug intake perhaps offers a method for evaluating the oral abuse potential of a drug under conditions which generate a variety of behavioral excesses and may potentiate intrinsic reinforcing efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Certain populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) are highly resistant to endrin (42-fold), but are not cross-resistant to cypermethrin. These populations show relatively low levels of resistance (2-fold) to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS). Studies comparing specific [35S]TBPS binding to brain membrane preparations from resistant and susceptible fish indicate a reduced binding capacity for TBPS in membranes from resistant fish. Endrin was about twice as potent in competitively inhibiting [35S] TBPS binding in vitro to membranes from susceptible fish as compared to membranes from resistant fish, suggesting that TBPS binding sites in resistant fish brain are less sensitive to endrin. Endrin was 37 times as potent in competitively inhibiting [35S]TBPS binding in vivo to membranes from susceptible fish compared to membranes from resistant fish, indicating that a contributory factor is involved in endrin resistance. Data for TBPS inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding revealed an approximate 2-fold difference between resistant and susceptible for both in vitro and in vivo IC50, indicating that an altered TBPS binding site is the only factor involved in TBPS resistance. DDT did not inhibit [35S] TBPS binding, suggesting that DDT resistance is not due to changes at the TBPS receptor. These data support the hypothesis that two factors operate in vertebrate resistance to endrin, whereas only one of these factors confers TBPS resistance. These resistance mechanisms are not functional against cypermethrin.\r"

Pretreatment with the 5-HT antagonists metergoline, methysergide or mianserin, but not selective 5-HT2 or catecholamine antagonists, blocked the reduction of activity caused by TFMPP suggesting that the stimulation of 5-HT receptors was involved in causing this behavioral effect. Other behavioral signs of 5-HT receptor stimulation, such as the 5-HT behavioral syndrome or head-shaking behavior, were not observed in rats injected with TFMPP, m-CPP or MK-212 except at toxic doses. The ability of piperazine agonists to reduce locomotor activity in rats was altered by long-term changes in 5-HT neurotransmission. The destruction of 5-HT neurons by i.v.t. injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine potentiated the ability of m-CPP to inhibit ambulatory behavior. On the other hand, elevating 5-HT content by administering the monoamine oxidase inhibitors phenelzine or nialamide for 7 days reduced the ability of m-CPP to suppress locomotor activity. Acute administration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or chronic administration of other antidepressants such as desmethylimipramine or iprindole, failed to alter m-CPPs activity-suppressant effects. These studies suggest that chronic changes in 5-HT neurotransmission produce compensatory changes which alter the behavioral response to these piperazine agonists. Taken together with other evidence that both TFMPP and m-CPP are agonists at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, the effects of TFMPP and m-CPP on locomotor activity may be associated with the selective activation of 5-HT1C, or possibly 5-HT1B, receptors.\r"

The action of norepinephrine is believed to be mediated primarily by beta adrenergic receptors, and involves activation of adenylate cyclase. Ethanol, 25 to 50 mM, added to cultured pineal glands in vitro, enhanced isoproterenol-induced stimulation of cyclic AMP and melatonin production. The action of ethanol was observed only at doses of isoproterenol that produced a submaximal effect, and ethanol alone had no effect on cyclic AMP or melatonin release. Butanol, at a concentration of 2 mM, was as effective as 50 mM ethanol in increasing isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP and melatonin release, indicating that the response to alcohols was not due simply to changes in osmolarity, and may reflect a hydrophobic interaction of the alcohols with the cell membrane. The effects of ethanol on pineal cyclic AMP and melatonin release were reversible after a 15-min preincubation, but not after a 2-hr preincubation, suggesting that, over a long incubation period, ethanol may sensitize the pineal beta adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system to isoproterenol. The findings in this study are consistent with earlier work showing that ethanol increases cerebral cortical beta adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase activity, and demonstrate that the effect of ethanol on the receptor-effector system can result in an endocrinological response.\r"

This treatment resulted in the release of both norepinephrine and epinephrine upon nerve stimulation but no increase in fractional stimulus-induced overflow. Experiments utilizing beta and/or alpha adrenoceptor blockade revealed that beta adrenoreceptor blockade alone had no effect on overflow but that a dose-dependent decrease in stimulus-induced overflow was produced by beta adrenoceptor blockade after alpha adrenoceptor blockade. Thus, under normal conditions the facilitatory influence of epinephrine via prejunctional beta adrenoceptors is masked by the prejunctional alpha adrenoceptor negative feedback loop. The effects of extraneuronal presentation of isoproterenol, salbutamol and epinephrine on stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow also were examined. In the absence of alpha adrenoceptor blockade, only epinephrine failed to enhance neurotransmitter overflow. After competitive alpha adrenoceptor blockade, all three agents produced significant increases in stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow from the rat kidney, although alpha adrenoceptor stimulation appeared to limit this effect at high agonist concentrations. We conclude that the dominance of prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors in the rat kidney results in the inability of epinephrine to produce beta adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of neurotransmitter overflow even when it is incorporated into renal neurotransmitter stores and coreleased with endogenous norepinephrine upon nerve stimulation.\r"

In general, increasingly hydrophobic, simple nonbranching carbamoyl groups (as in octyl-, butyl- and benzylcarbamoyl eseroline) did not greatly alter potency vs. AChE whereas increasingly hydrophobic N(1)-substitutions [i.e., N(1)-allyl-, -phenethyl and -benzylphysostigmine] decreased potency vs. AChE. In contrast, increasing the hydrophobicity of both the carbamoyl and N(1) groups increased the potency of the compound against BChE. Furthermore, quaternarization at the N(1) position (physostigmine methosulfate) increased potency vs. AChE but reduced potency vs. BChE. Bulky, branched carbamoyl groups (e.g., N-benzyl-N-benzyl-allophanyl eseroline) were all poor anticholinesterases. N-phenylcarbamoyl eseroline was as potent as benzylcarbamoyl eseroline against AChE yet was 50 to 100 times less potent than the benzyl analog vs. BChE. Therefore, the phenyl substitution appears to increase greatly the selectivity of the compound for AChE. Although it is not possible to determine whether physostigmine analogs that are potent in vitro might be of interest in vivo, these results do show that the structure of physostigmine can be changed significantly while retaining biological activity.\r"

Both CTA and U46619 contracted the arterial rings and augmented contractile responses to electrical stimulation (4-20 Hz). The CTA and U46619 also augmented contractile responses to norepinephrine (P less than .05) and enhanced norepinephrine release in response to a 16 Hz electrical stimulation (P less than .05). The increases in basal force, neurogenic responses and norepinephrine release were prevented by the thromboxane receptor antagonist, (1S-[1-alpha,2-beta(5Z),3-beta, 4-alpha])-7-[3- [(2- [(phenylamino)carbonyl]hydrazino]methyl]-7- oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid. The U46619 was more potent than CTA and had a more consistent effect on norepinephrine release. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane receptor agonists augment adrenergic neurogenic responses via thromboxane receptors. The mechanism of the enhanced neurogenic responses involved both pre- and postjunctional effects of the thromboxane receptor agonists.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists exhibit antidiarrheal activity in animal models and in humans. However, hypotensive and sedative side effects seriously limit the use of these agents to treat diarrhea. SK&F 35886 (2,6-dimethyl phenylamino imidazoline) is an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist with little central nervous system activity. In Ussing chamber preparations of rabbit ileum, SK&F 35886 produces a concentration-dependent decrease in basal short-circuit current (Isc) (EC50 0.2 microM) that is dependent on the presence of mucosal HCO3. This concentration-response curve is shifted to the right of rauwolscine, increasing the EC50 to 30 microM. Prazosin had no effect on this response. Flux studies indicate that SK&F 35886 increases net Cl absorption and enhances HCO3 absorption without altering net Na flux. After PGE2 stimulation of Isc, SK&F 35886, applied either serosally or mucosally, immediately returns the Isc to base line. This effect is due to a reversal of the PGE2-induced inhibition of Na and Cl absorption. In vivo SK&F 35886 dose-dependently inhibits PGE2-induced enteropooling when given orally (ED50 approximately 31 micrograms/kg). This effect is attenuated significantly by rauwolscine (1.0 micrograms/kg s.c.). In cecectomized rats, SK&F 35886 abolishes PGE2-induced diarrhea within 1 hr after oral administration of the drug. SK&F 35886 (500 micrograms/kg p.o.) did not alter hexobarbital sleep time or elicit piloerection or lethargy, whereas clonidine (37.3 micrograms/kg p.o.) significantly enhanced hexobarbital sleep time. These results illustrate the ability of a peripheral acting alpha-2 agonist to promote absorption and inhibit secretion and diarrhea in the mammalian intestine.\r"

These studies were designed to characterize further the nature of the noradrenergic deficit in GEPRs, which has been described as a reduction in steady-state NE levels. The high affinity (desmethylimipramine-sensitive) uptake of 3H-NE into crude synaptosomes was found to be significantly reduced in widespread areas of the GEPR forebrain including cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. GEPRs also displayed a reduced uptake of 3H-NE in synaptosomes from the inferior colliculus, a structure that has been implicated in the audiogenic seizure, but other regions of the brain stem (reticular formation, cochlear nucleus, cerebellum) failed to reveal abnormalities in NE uptake. Reductions in dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity seemed to parallel the reductions in NE uptake regionally (except for the caudate nucleus), and both deficits (uptake and dopamine beta-hydroxylase) were similar in magnitude to the decrements in steady-state NE levels reported previously. The present findings therefore support the concept that there is a reduction in the number of noradrenergic terminals in most structures receiving noradrenergic innervations in the GEPR brain.\r"

  ".W": "These studies examined the ability of electrical field stimulation (EFS) to influence antigen-induced responses in the guinea pig isolated trachea and main-stem bronchi. Airways isolated from guinea pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin were superfused and stimulated transmurally with square pulses of 1 msec duration at a frequency of 16 pulses per sec. In the trachea, EFS caused an atropine-sensitive contraction followed by a maintained relaxation. The relaxation consisted of adrenergic and nonadrenergic components. In the bronchus, EFS caused a maintained contraction. This contraction was due to a combination of cholinergic (atropine-sensitive) and noncholinergic (capsaicin-sensitive) mechanisms. Histamine could not be detected in superfusate samples during electrical stimulation alone of either the trachea or bronchus. EFS significantly inhibited ovalbumin-induced tracheal contractions by about 30% without altering ovalbumin-induced histamine or immunoreactive peptido-leukotriene release from the tissues. EFS had a similar inhibitory effect on the contraction induced by application of exogenous histamine (10(-5) M). The electrical stimulus-induced inhibition of the antigen-induced contraction was abolished by tetrodotoxin and propranolol and reduced by a combination of atropine, propranolol and phentolamine. Norepinephrine (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited ovalbumin-induced histamine release by about 30% without altering the contraction. Carbamylcholine had no effect on ovalbumin-induced histamine release. In the guinea pig bronchus, EFS stimulation had no effect on either histamine release or contraction induced by ovalbumin. These results demonstrate that in the guinea pig trachea nerve stimulation can significantly antagonize antigen-induced contractions and suggest that this is due to a functional antagonism by adrenergic and nonadrenergic relaxant neurotransmitters at the level of the airway smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist buspirone stimulated rat prolactin (PRL) secretion. Administration of the 5-HT1A agonists gepirone (GEP) or ipsapirone (IPS) s.c. in doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg had no effect on PRL secretion in male rats. However, pretreatment with GEP (10 mg/kg) or IPS (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase in serum PRL concentration elicited by the 5-HT agonists 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-pyrazine (MK-212). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of GEP or IPS was related to a serotonergic mechanism or a more general inhibitory effect on PRL secretion, the ability of GEP and IPS to inhibit the haloperidol- or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced increase in PRL secretion was studied. GEP (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) and IPS (10 mg/kg) inhibited the increase in PRL secretion produced by either haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg) or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (75 mg/kg). Furthermore, GEP produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PRL secretion from anterior pituitary tissue incubated in vitro. The inhibitory effect of GEP was comparable to that of dopamine in this system. Moreover, haloperidol blocked completely the GEP-mediated suppression of PRL secretion in this preparation. These data suggest agonist properties of both GEP and IPS at D2 dopamine receptors. In light of other evidence that GEP has D2 antagonist effects in vivo, we hypothesize that GEP and perhaps IPS are partial dopamine agonists which may contribute to their antianxiety and/or antidepressant properties.\r"

Potency and was measured for (-)- and (+)-epinephrine in aorta, longitudinal muscle of portal vein, spleen and vas deferens. After partial alpha-adrenoreceptor inactivation with phenoxybenzamine, dissociation constant was estimated for each enantiomer and used to estimate efficacy. Whereas potency, affinity and efficacy vary between tissues, there is a constant relationship between (-)- and (+)-enantiomer; the enantiomeric ratio is constant for both potency and affinity. Efficacy is similar for the enantiomers in each tissue. The potency difference between epinephrine enantiomers at alpha-adrenoreceptors in rat tissues is due to differences in affinity rather than efficacy.\r"

A possible antido paminergic drug effect is not involved, due to its inability to modify prolactin release from superfused pituitary in vitro as well as rat haloperidol hyperprolactinemia in vivo. On the contrary, in the rat idazoxan counteracts hyperprolactinemias due to central presynaptic serotonergic neurotransmission increase (5-hydroxytryptophan, D-fenfluramine and fluoxetine) but not those related to direct agonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor (6-chloro-2-[1-piperazinyl] pyrazine, MK 212; 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-aminopropane, DOI). (+/-)-Idazoxan does not modify [3H]-5-HT release from isolated hypothalamic synaptosomes. It displays an affinity for alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors about 250-fold more than for alpha-2 heteroreceptors located on 5-HT nerve terminals in the central nervous system (pA2 value 9.99, equivalent to a Kb of 0.1 nM vs. pA2 7.60 equivalent to a Kb of 2.5 nM). The noradrenergic outflow selectively induced by idazoxan in the brain may negatively modulate the 5-HT release from the relevant nerve endings, thus preventing prolactin release due to an activation of presynaptic serotonergic axons induced both physiologically (lactation) and pharmacologically (5-hydroxytryptophan, D-fenfluramine and fluoxetine) without influencing hyperprolactinemias related to a direct activation of serotonergic receptors (MK 212 and DOI). Other blocking agents, strong but less selective than (+/-)-idazoxan for noradrenergic brain neurotransmission, do not modify or increase blood prolactin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present experiments this compound has been characterized for luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion-stimulating effects in a variety of experimental paradigms in the rat. In juvenile female rats, serum LH levels were elevated markedly after s.c. or p.o. administration of SDZ 210-096; ED50 was less than 1 mg/kg p.o. at 60 min. Similar effects were seen in the male rat, with p.o. ED50 values of 1.5 and 2.8 mg/kg at 60 and 120 min, respectively. Serum LH levels were likewise elevated by this compound in adult female rats (both proestrous and diestrous). SDZ 210-096 maintained its LH secretion-stimulating capability in both male and female rats after up to 10 days of administration. Its effects were inhibited in a competitive manner by a mu (SDZ 202-250) and a kappa (bremazocine) opiate agonist. Moderate effects on prolactin and adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (inhibition and stimulation, respectively) were observed. SDZ 210-096 exhibited specific high affinity binding to brain opiate binding sites. These results demonstrate that in the rat SDZ 210-096 is a potent, p.o.-active LH secretion stimulator, effective after repeated as well as acute application.\r"

  ".U": "89216587\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of long-term endogenous catecholamine exposure on the regulation of leukocyte and adipocyte beta adrenoceptor subtypes were studied through an experimental model of chronic neurogenic hypertension in the dog. Chronic sinoaortic denervation (SAD) is associated with a significant increase in plasma catecholamine levels, a reduction in the total beta adrenoceptor number of the leukocytes (52%) as well as of the omental adipocytes (59%). Using highly selective beta antagonists (bisoprolol for beta-1; ICI 118,551 for beta-2 adrenoceptors) we demonstrate that the normal dog fat cell possess both beta-2 and beta-1 adrenoceptors in proportions of 67 and 33%, respectively. SAD-induced catecholamine enhancement promotes a strong reduction of beta-2 (but not beta-1) adrenoceptor number (from 237 +/- 28 to 52 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein) leading to a new relative distribution in fat cell membranes: 36% for beta-2 and 64% for beta-1 adrenoceptors. Such a different regulation provokes major consequences in the associated-biological effect on adipocytes when evaluating the lipolytic process. Lipolysis induced by epinephrine or isoproterenol (two mixed agonists) is weakly but significantly reduced whereas lipolysis induced by procaterol (a highly selective beta-2 agonist) is strongly reduced. These data fit with the results of the binding studies and demonstrate the loss in beta-2 adrenoceptor number and efficiency in SAD dogs. The present study demonstrates a differential regulation of beta adrenoceptors: beta-2 but not beta-1 adrenoceptors are decreased by long-term exposure to high plasma levels of endogenous catecholamines in the dog.\r"

Abdominal s.c. arteries were obtained from patients who died 3 to 12 hr before, and vascular segments 2 mm in length and 600 to 1050 microns in external diameter were prepared for isometric tension recording. On application of norepinephrine, phenylephrine (alpha-1 adrenergic agonist) or clonidine (alpha-2 adrenergic agonist) the arteries contracted in a dose-dependent manner and, in terms of the mean EC50 values, the order of potencies was clonidine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine. With regard to their ability to induce maximal contraction, the order was norepinephrine = phenylephrine greater than clonidine. In the presence of phentolamine (nonspecific alpha adrenergic antagonist) or yohimbine (selective alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist) the control curve for norepinephrine was displaced to the right in a parallel way. Prazosin (selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist) depressed both the slope and maximal response of the control curve for norepinephrine but the shift was not significant. Prazosin and yohimbine produced a parallel rightward shift in the control curve for phenylephrine and clonidine, respectively. These results suggest that skin arteries of humans have a mixed population of postjunctional alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors and that alpha-2 adrenoceptors are more prominent. They also suggest that the alpha-2 adrenergic component of the response to norepinephrine is a low-maximum effect compared to the alpha-1 adrenergic component. This could be of significance in regulating skin blood flow and thermoregulatory function.\r"

  ".W": "The interactions of binedaline (binodaline), a new antidepressant drug, and its main metabolites with neurotransmitter receptors and monoamine uptake sites were studied. In receptor binding assays, binedaline was compared to amitriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline and mianserin. Unlike these drugs binedaline did not show any significant affinity for an alpha adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, histamine H1 or serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptors. Binedaline and desmethylbinedaline were potent inhibitors of the uptake of norepinephrine in synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (Ki = 25 and 29 nM, respectively). Binedaline also inhibited 5-HT uptake with a weak affinity (Ki = 847 nM) but was inactive as an inhibitor of dopamine uptake in synaptosomes from rat striatum (Ki greater than 2 microM). No specific binding was found using [3H]binedaline. After 2 weeks of daily administration of binedaline (20 mg/kg i.p.), the number of beta adrenergic recognition sites labeled with [3H]CGP 12177 remained constant in rat forebrain, as did 5-HT2 receptors and benzodiazepine receptors. In contrast a prolonged treatment with maprotiline (20 mg/kg i.p.) increased the apparent Kd value of [3H]CGP 12177 by 43% and the apparent maximal binding value of [3H]RO 15-1788 by 20% as compared to control. Our results indicate that binedaline is comparable to a tricyclic antidepressant drug in inhibiting the norepinephrine uptake but, however, it is devoid of affinity for neurotransmitter receptors. This probably explains why this drug does not induce the classical side effects of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. These results also suggest that a reduction in beta adrenergic, 5-HT2 or benzodiazepine receptors is not always related to an antidepressant chronic treatment.\r"

Using pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling in nonsteady-state conditions, of the antagonism by the beta blockers of the terbutaline-induced hypokalemia, the beta blocker beta-2 selectivity was quantitated in the terms of IC50 values representing plasma concentrations resulting in half-receptor occupancy. Six healthy subjects were given an 0.5-mg s.c. dose of terbutaline on three occasions: 1) 1 hr after p.o. administration of a placebo; 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o.; and 3) 1 hr after 80 mg of oxprenolol p.o. During 7 hr after terbutaline administration drug concentrations and effects were monitored. Oxprenolol decreased both terbutaline volume of distribution (-69%) and clearance (-63%) and increased its area under plasma concentrations vs. time curve (+157%). Such effects of metoprolol on terbutaline pharmacokinetics were not observed. The dynamic model offered a good description of the observed effects. The apparent IC50 values varied between 42 and 68 ng/ml (mean, 54 ng/ml) for metoprolol and between 3.6 and 4.7 ng/ml (mean, 4.1 ng/ml) for oxprenolol. In view of these results, and comparing them with apparent beta-1 IC50 values as reported in the literature, metoprolol can be considered a relatively beta-1 selective agent. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling of the interaction of beta-2 sympathicomimetics and beta blocking agents after single dosing, seems to be a suitable method for the determination of the relative beta-2 selectivity of the antagonist.\r"

Accordingly, in the present experiment young Wistar rats drank increasing concentrations (0.1-0.5 mg/ml) of morphine in water, or water alone, for 37 days. Half the rats in each group were challenged with morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) when 27 to 29 hr withdrawn, and half with saline. Rats were sacrificed 2 hr postinjection. Seven brain regions were analyzed for noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and their respective metabolites. In all cases in which a comparison could be made with prior work utilizing repeated injections to produce dependence, the p.o. regimen produced the same effects. Thus, the mode of administration does not seem to modify the response of monoaminergic neurons to chronic morphine. In withdrawal, NA turnover increased but DA and 5-HT turnovers decreased. Acute morphine accelerated the turnover of all three monoamines. The NA response was attenuated in some brain regions of withdrawn rats, indicating the development of tolerance to the turnover-enhancing effect of acute morphine in noradrenergic neurons. In contrast, the effect of acute morphine on cerebral 5-HT turnover was not altered, and its effect on cerebral DA turnover was enhanced in withdrawn rats. Our results suggest that there are fundamental differences among the three monoaminergic systems in their capacities for adapting to chronic morphine treatment.\r"

Although the receptors that inhibit synaptic transmission and regulate cyclic AMP formation have been well characterized in terms of their pharmacological properties, the receptor(s) that mediate the postsynaptic actions of adenosine have not. We have used the adenosine-mediated inhibition of low calcium bursting in the rat hippocampal slice preparation as a measure of a postsynaptic effect of adenosine. Low calcium bursting consists of repetitive spiking evoked by antidromic stimulation of the CA1 pyramidal neurons and can be suppressed by adenosine. In the present study, we compared the effects of a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline, on functional responses to adenosine in hippocampal slices. Its apparent affinities for the receptors mediating the following effects were increases in cyclic AMP formation (1700 nM), decreases in cyclic AMP formation after forskolin pretreatment (57 nM), inhibition of excitatory synaptic responses (42 nM), inhibition of repetitive spiking (45 nM), and it was a competitive antagonist for all responses tested. These data demonstrate that inhibition of transmitter release, adenylate cyclase and low calcium bursting in the hippocampus are all mediated via adenosine receptors that have pharmacological properties similar to the A1 receptor and that 8-cyclopentyltheophylline has a high degree of selectivity for this receptor as opposed to the A2 receptor that mediates increases in cyclic AMP formation.\r"

The moment analysis of the blood ethanol concentration-time curves showed that the normalized area under the blood ethanol concentration-time curve and the first moment increase with increasing dose amount in the control and pyrazole-pretreated groups. These increases suggested the capacity-limited elimination of ethanol through pyrazole-insensitive non-ADH pathways as well as through ADH pathway as pyrazole would fully block the oxidation of ethanol through ADH pathway. The simultaneous multiline fitting using time curves after five different doses also was attempted to determine the pharmacokinetic model by the application of minimum Akaike's information criterion estimation. Akaike's information criterion, consequently, showed the minimum for a two-compartment model with parallel first-order and Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics. The computer analysis using this model yielded almost the same values of the volume of distribution and of the first-order elimination rate constant between both groups. The distribution of ethanol and the first-order elimination process were not influenced by pyrazole treatment. Km (0.57 mg/ml) of the pyrazole-pretreated group was higher than Km (0.03 mg/ml) of the control group. These results suggest that ADH pathway is readily saturated and non-ADH pathways are unsaturated over the wide range of concentration. The first-order process as well as non-ADH pathways are concluded to occupy the considerable part in the ethanol elimination at higher blood concentration.\r"

  ".W": "By using the cannula inserting method, vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (a mixed alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist), phenylephrine (a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist), clonidine and xylazine (selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists) were investigated in the isolated and perfused canine pulmonary vein. The segment of vessels was perfused by Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution at a constant flow rate at 37 degrees C. Two hours after setting up the perfusion preparation, norepinephrine and phenylephrine induced dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure. Xylazine and clonidine, however, did not induce any significant responses at this time. Although the vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine and phenylephrine did not change statistically during 11 hr after setting up, xylazine-induced responses were perfusion-time-dependently and significantly enhanced 5, 8 and 11 hr after setting up. On the other hand, clonidine induced no significant vascular responses during 11 hr. Xylazine-induced responses were antagonized by DG-5128 (a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist), but not by bunazosin (a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist). Furthermore, even in the endothelium-removed preparation by treatment with saponin, the enhancement of xylazine-induced responses were similarly observed in a time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that, in the isolated and perfused canine pulmonary vein, xylazine-induced alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor response was time-dependently enhanced with the presence and absence of the endothelium. In contrast with xylazine, clonidine did not induce significant vasoconstriction during the experiments. This result suggests that clonidine has little activity at the alpha-2 adrenoceptors which mediate latent xylazine-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated, long-time-perfused canine pulmonary veins.\r"

  ".W": "The tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) is present at high concentrations within the mammalian gut, although its physiological function is undefined. In this study, the actions of NT and structurally related peptides neuromedin N (NM-N) and xenopsin were characterized on ion transport in the porcine distal jejunal mucosa in vitro. The serosal-side administration of these peptides elicited rapid changes in transmural potential difference and short-circuit current (Isc) which were greater in mesenteric than in antimesenteric segments. NT-induced elevations in Isc were dependent upon external permeant anions and were associated with net Cl transport in both segments. In mesenteric segments, NT and its homologs increased Isc with the order of potency: NT greater than NM-N greater than xenopsin. NT produced tachyphylaxis to its own actions and to those of NM-N; NM-N was ineffective in producing tachyphylaxis. Isc elevations produced by NT were inhibited by the neuronal conduction blocker tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM) or the Ca++-channel blocker dl-verapamil (100 microM) and reduced in Ca++-free media. Antagonists to the enteric transmitters acetylcholine, ATP, 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P and histamine did not alter Isc responses of mesenteric segments to NT. Serosal administration of vasoactive intestinal peptide (10 nM) did not resemble the effects of NT. The magnitude of Isc responses to these agonists was smaller in antimesenteric segments. These results indicate that NT-related peptides present in mucosal endocrine cells or nerves of the porcine jejunum may modulate Cl transport through mechanisms that involve the Ca++-dependent release of unknown enteric neurotransmitters. Moreover, there appear to exist within the distal jejunum circumferential differences in mucosal responses to NT and other neurohumoral factors.\r"

There was a corresponding strain variation in the effects of cyclophosphamide on levels of pulmonary mRNA encoding alpha 2I and alpha 1III procollagen, and transforming growth factor-beta. In BALB/c mice, the ratios of alpha 2I and alpha 1III procollagen mRNA to polyadenylated RNA were increased 1 week after cyclophosphamide injection. No increases in levels of either procollagen mRNA occurred in C57Bl/6 mice. The ratio of fibronectin mRNA to polyadenylated RNA was elevated to a similar extent in both murine strains during the 1st week after cyclophosphamide treatment. The pulmonary content of transforming growth factor-beta mRNA and its ratio to polyadenylated RNA increased 2-fold at 1 and 2 weeks in BALB/c but not C57Bl/6 mice. Thus, collagen accumulation in cyclophosphamide-sensitive mice is preceded by increased pulmonary alpha 2I and alpha 1III procollagen mRNA. The early strain selective elevation of transforming growth factor-beta mRNA in response to cyclophosphamide suggests a role, in vivo, for transforming growth factor-beta in drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of histamine (HA) on the release of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) from superfused rat hypothalamic and striatal slices was assessed. Measurements were made by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Superfusion with HA (0.1-80 microM) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase (10-220%) of NE release from hypothalamus but was ineffective in the striatum. The process was Ca++-dependent and was unaffected by blockade of monoamine oxidase. The H2 agonists, dimaprit (50 microM) and impromidine (10 microM), increased NE release from hypothalamic slices 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Tiotidine (10 microM), an H2 antagonist, did not alter the spontaneous release of NE but completely abolished the effect of dimaprit. To increase the ability of the tissue to sustain NE release on repeated stimulation, tyrosine was added to the perfusion medium. Under these conditions 10 microM HA produced, in two consecutive stimuli, a 1.9-fold increase. Two consecutive stimuli by 80 microM HA elicited a 3.2- and a 2.9-fold increase. Under the same conditions, 50 microM ranitidine, another H2 antagonist, but not pyrilamine, an H1 antagonist, completely blocked the effect of 10 microM HA. Although NE release was increased in the presence of tyrosine, tyrosine did not increase the tissue levels of NE. These experiments imply that H2 receptor activation increases release of NE from the rat hypothalamus. Since in the hypothalamic slice, noradrenergic nerve endings are cut from their cell bodies, the modulatory event must have occurred at the nerve terminals.\r"

Strips of canine left circumflex coronary arteries and saphenous veins were incubated with [3H]norepinephrine and suspended for superfusion. Ergonovine (10(-6) M) decreased the overflow of [3H] norepinephrine to a modest degree in the coronary artery, whereas a profound inhibition of overflow was observed in the saphenous vein. Methiothepin, but not rauwolscine, reversed the inhibitory effect of ergonovine in both blood vessels. Treatment with atropine or droperidol did not alter the response to ergonovine in the coronary artery. The results demonstrate that ergonovine, by activating prejunctional serotonergic receptors, inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission to a greater extent in the saphenous vein than in the coronary artery. The differential effect of ergonovine on norepinephrine release in these vessels may provide evidence for heterogeneity in the prejunctional modulation of adrenergic neurotransmission.\r"

Rings of saphenous vein were suspended in physiological salt solution for the recording of isometric force. Cooling (from 37-24 degrees C) caused no significant increase in force in quiescent rings. Similarly, the same degree of cooling had no significant effect on the response to exogenous norepinephrine (10(-9)-10(-5) M), whether under control conditions or in the presence of either the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin (3 X 10(-7) M) or the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist rauwolscine (10(-7) M). Contractions evoked by the alpha-1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine were reduced, but those induced by the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK 14,304 (10(-9)-10(-5) M) were unaffected by the same degree of cooling. Cooling augmented the response elicited by electrical field stimulation of the sympathetic nerves, although only under conditions of alpha-1 or combined alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic blockade. Data obtained with the sympathomimetic tyramine suggest that both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors are innervated in this blood vessel. Together, the present data suggest that the effects of acute cooling on the saphenous vein of the rabbit, unlike that of the dog, are not mediated by changes in the affinity of postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".U": "89216606\r", 
  ".W": "The common method for estimating agonist dissociation constants (KA) is the method proposed separately by Furchgott and Mackay. Concentrations of the given agonist producing the same response before ([A]) and after ([A']) irreversible inactivation of a fraction of the receptors (1-q) are described by the equation: 1/[A] = 1/(q*[A']) + (1-q)/(q*KA) and plotted on axes of 1/[A] vs. 1/[A']. The double reciprocal method suffers from the disadvantage that undue weight may be placed on values generated from the smallest observed responses. Our new method of estimating KA and q uses hyperbolic functions to directly fit both concentration-response curves. The control curve is fit to the logistic equation: response = (M* [A]n)/(kn + [A]n); where M is the maximal tissue response, n is the apparent kinetic order of the response at low [A] and k is [A] required for a half-maximal response. The postinactivation concentration-response curve is simultaneously fit to the following equation: response' = M/(((k/(q*KA*[A']))*(KA + [A']* (1-q)))n + 1). This new method was shown to determine KA and q more accurately and precisely than other methods when applied to an artificial data set. In experiments with the rat anococcygeus muscle, the nested hyperbolic method gave estimates of KA with less variance and less range than the double reciprocal method. The nested hyperbolic method was shown to be a valid method of estimating KA and q that has advantages over the other methods.\r"

SZL49 competed with nanomolar potency at [3H]prazosin binding sites of rat tissues. Pretreatment of membranes with SZL49 (10 nM) followed by washing led to a reduction in [3H]prazosin binding without a change in the Kd of the remaining sites. However, preincubation even at a concentration of 1 microM, led to only a 50% reduction in binding. Higher concentrations of SZL49 in the preincubation mixtures increased the Kd of the remaining sites. Pretreatment of membranes with phenoxybenzamine led to greater than 80% reduction in these sites. Preincubating membranes with SZL49 together with prazosin prevented the loss of binding caused by SZL49 alone. Utilizing different buffers or altering the ratio of absolute amounts of SZL49 and receptors in the preincubations failed to increase the blockade of [3H]prazosin binding sites. SZL49 was injected i.p. into rats and 16 hr later membranes were prepared from tissues and [3H]prazosin saturation experiments were performed. Whereas Kd values in brain and heart were no different from controls, the Kd value of the remaining kidney binding sites was increased approximately 5-fold in test animals in contrast to in vitro experiments. Maximum binding values of heart were reduced significantly by approximately 42%. Maximum binding values of kidney and brain were reduced about 21 and 36%, respectively. In functional studies with isolated rat aorta, pretreatment with SZL49, followed by a 1.5 hr washout, shifted to the right in a dose-dependent manner the dose-response curves for phenylephrine and norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With increasing doses of morphine, fetal tachycardia was observed without significant changes in FBP, and the peak response (38.3 +/- 8%) in FHR was reached at a dose of 2.5 mg/hr. Further increases in dose were associated with a decrease in the magnitude of response. This resulted in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. This tachycardia was completely abolished by either naloxone or propranolol pretreatment. These results indicate that i.v. morphine administrated produces tachycardia in unanesthetized unrestrained fetal lambs, and this effect is mediated via specific opioid receptors and involves the beta adrenergic system.\r"

The aim of the present study was to determine whether diltiazem, administered during reperfusion, can improve regional blood flow and lower O2 extraction in the previously occluded region. In open-chest anesthetized dogs, 2-hr occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was followed by a 4-hr period of reperfusion. In 7 of the 15 animals, diltiazem (0.45 micrograms/kg/min) was infused i.v. during the reperfusion period; this was preceded by a loading dose of 0.18 micrograms/kg 10 min before release. Small artery and vein O2 saturations obtained microspectrophotometrically were combined with regional blood flow measurements using radioactive microspheres to determine regional myocardial O2 consumption. In both groups, coronary occlusion lowered regional flow to a similar level. After a 4-hr reperfusion, flow to the subendocardial region of treated hearts was significantly greater than that to the untreated reperfused myocardium (75.6 +/- 46.4 vs. 40.3 +/- 25.8 ml/min/100 g), and did not differ from the preocclusion level. The subendocardium/subepicardium flow ratio was reversed in occluded and untreated reperfused myocardium (subendocardium flow less than subepicardium flow), but was not reversed in treated reperfused regions. Myocardial oxygen extraction was 11.0 +/- 2.4 ml of O2/100 ml of blood in the untreated reperfused subendocardium, and was significantly decreased to 8.5 +/- 0.9 ml of O2/100 ml in the treated subendocardium. The proportion of individual veins having O2 saturations below 25% was significantly reduced by diltiazem treatment from 45.2 to 22.7%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The analgesic effect of low dose naloxone was abolished in rats that had been pretreated 24 hr earlier with a large intrathecal dose of naloxone or 20 min previously with the delta receptor specific antagonist, ICI-174,864. A large intrathecal dose of naloxone administered 24 hr previously also abolished the analgesic effects of the delta-specific ligands [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin and [D-Ser2]-Leu enkephalin-Thr but not those produced by mu-ligands Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol and beta-Casomorphin(1-4) amide or by the kappa-specific ligand, U50,488H. Furthermore, the analgesic action of low dose naloxone (on thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold tests) persisted in rats made tolerant to mu-opioid receptor specific ligands. We conclude that the analgesic action of a low dose of naloxone is mediated via interaction with a stereospecific binding site with the characteristics of the delta-opioid receptor.\r"

We have extended these analyses to the molecular level in a model that uses transfection of the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) gene of influenza virus into murine CT-26 colorectal carcinoma cells. Transfection was followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to select a parent population with expression of high levels of HA. We characterized this population (FACS-3) and four derived clones (5, 6, 9, and 18) over time with regard to phenotypic characteristics: immunogenicity and cross-protection against tumor challenge, cell surface expression of HA, evidence of HA gene amplification, and levels of HA mRNA. During 6 months in culture, the FACS-3 parent cells remained stable, but the individual clones varied for all of the parameters assessed. Among the clones, all possible molecular variations occurred, including changes in HA gene copy number (increased in clone 5 and decreased in clone 18), gene rearrangement (clone 5), decrease in HA mRNA (clones 6, 9, and 18), increase in HA mRNA (clone 5), and an abnormality in translational control or a posttranslational error. In all cases, the molecular changes correlated with cell surface HA expression, immunogenicity, and cross-protective potential. We conclude that in vitro clonal interactions play a role in stabilizing heterogeneity in this system. These studies show that even in the absence of selection, clonal interactions may alter the phenotype of tumors by increasing malignant progression or impeding tumor growth.\r"

The specific binding of two anti-human melanoma antibodies (96.5 and ZME-018) and a control antibody (ZCE-025) to three human melanoma cell lines (DX3, A375-M, and Hs294t) was examined under in vitro conditions and compared to in vivo localization of 111In-labeled antibodies to the same cells growing as solid tumors in the subcutis of nude mice. The in vitro binding of the specific MAbs to the tumor cells did not predict in vivo localization. Under in vitro conditions, MAb ZME-018 bound to all three cell lines at levels exceeding that of 96.5, yet ZME-018 did not show superior localization to subcutaneous tumors. MAb 96.5 bound to cultured DX3 cells at levels exceeding those observed with A375-M cells. Yet, 96.5 localized better to A375-M xenografts in nude mice than to DX3 or Hs294t xenografts. Antigen expression differed between in vitro and in vivo growing cells, as evidenced by alteration in binding of 96.5 to tumor cells dissociated from solid subcutaneous tumors. Collectively, the data suggest that in vitro parameters do not predict the clinically relevant localization of MAbs to tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies have shown that the P-glycoprotein is a cell membrane efflux pump that is quantitatively increased in expression in multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines. In this study, fresh tumor tissues from patients with multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma, or metastatic breast cancer were studied immunohistochemically for P-glycoprotein expression and for in vitro sensitivity to doxorubicin. Twenty-six patients who were either previously untreated or in relapse after chemotherapy had tumor specimens submitted that could be evaluated in both assays. The testing was done independently and blindly in separate laboratories instead of our being provided relevant clinical data on the patients. Tumor cells from 12 of the 26 patients (46%) stained positively for P-glycoprotein. Fifteen of the 26 specimens (58%) exhibited drug resistance in vitro. Although only three (21%) of the 14 P-glycoprotein-negative tumors exhibited in vitro resistance to doxorubicin, all 12 fresh tumors that stained positively for P-glycoprotein were resistant to doxorubicin. The difference in frequency of intrinsic doxorubicin resistance between P-glycoprotein-negative and -positive tumors was highly significant (P less than .001). Similar trends were observed in each of the individual tumor categories and were statistically significant in myeloma and breast cancer. Four of the biopsy specimens that stained positively for P-glycoprotein and exhibited doxorubicin resistance were from patients who had not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Similar conclusions were reached when results of drug sensitivity tests were ranked in relation to the median infective dose rather than by criteria based on correlations with clinical drug resistance. Our findings indicate that positive staining for P-glycoprotein associated with multidrug resistance predicts intrinsic cellular resistance of human cancers to doxorubicin. We anticipate that immunohistochemical staining for P-glycoprotein will prove useful in clinical oncology.\r"

The elevated pHi in the most resistant (2,000-fold) variant dropped to the control level upon addition of verapamil, a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein activity. These data suggest that, in the absence of xenobiotic substrates, P-glycoprotein activity can affect cellular pHi. This finding may be important for the elucidation of the physiological function of this protein.\r"

During this 6-year period, there were 298 crashes involving 303 aircraft. There were 1,060 individuals aboard the crashed aircraft and 611 were injured, 136 fatally. The most common cause of injury was the \"secondary impact\" caused by collapse of structure into occupied areas, by inadequate restraint of the occupants which allowed them to flail into structure, or by a combination of both mechanisms. Injury solely related to acceleration occurred infrequently. The most frequently injured body regions in survivable crashes were the head (28%) and extremities (43%). Injury patterns are compared for different helicopter types and related to differences in design. Basic principles of crash injury protection, including individual protection by helmets, seatbelts, and airbags, and structural modifications to minimize injury potential, as well as crashworthy fuel systems, are reviewed, and recommendations are made to increase the crashworthiness of helicopters, such as adapting designs and standards on the basis of active field investigations.\r"

In their present form, both have serious biases in data selection, however, that can affect epidemiologic research results. This prospective study of 601 woodworking-related injuries seen at a trauma center involved a diverse population, a wide range of severities, both inpatients and outpatients, and primary versus referred patients. Eighty-eight per cent were outpatients and thus excluded by traditional trauma registries. Only 6% of primary patients, but 43% of referred patients, were hospitalized. Eighty-nine per cent of outpatients, and 28% of inpatients had AIS of 1. However, among primary patients 79% or more of lost or altered days of work, home, or recreational activity during 6 months postinjury occurred among ambulatory patients. Substantial differences were shown between hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and between primary and referred patients, in type of activity at time of injury, and in anatomic location and injury type. Trauma registry collection and analysis methods for epidemiologic research need substantial restructuring if they are to truly represent the tremendous problem of injury in our society.\r"

This report evaluates use of computerized tomographic (CT) scan in assessment of stable asymptomatic patients, with penetrating abdominal stab wounds, as an indicator of the necessity of abdominal exploration. In a prospective study, 50 patients with abdominal stab wounds were treated successfully with observation only, after admission abdominal CT scan interpretation was negative for pathology in 45 patients. In the remaining five it was of such minor nature that conservative management was justified (Series I). Twenty-eight stable asymptomatic patients with penetrating stab wounds of the abdomen comparable to the ones in Series I had CT scan on admission, and then underwent exploratory laparotomy independent of their CT scan findings (Series II). Of these 28 patients, 22 had correct CT scan findings verified by laparotomy, three were false positive for intra-abdominal injury resulting in negative explorations, and three patients had such nonspecific findings as fluid or air in the abdomen incompatible with precise organ injury identification. Our study shows that CT scan in patients with abdominal stab wounds identifies solid organ injury with great specificity and sensitivity, evaluates the retroperitoneum well, and detects peritoneal penetration by demonstrating intraperitoneal fluid or air. CT scan was unreliable in detection of bowel injury and does not demonstrate diaphragmatic injuries.\r"

We then investigated the 131 childhood deaths in greater detail, using coroners' or medical examiners' reports. Most of these shootings occurred at a residence. Handguns were involved more frequently than predicted by their reported availability in homes in the region. Almost two thirds of child deaths resulted from head wounds, reinforcing the importance of primary prevention. At least 40% of child deaths in this study appeared in part to be attributable to defects in firearm performance or current firearm design practices, suggesting that improvements should be sought and mandated.\r"

Resting VO2, Tc, and blood, spleen, and wound cultures were monitored for 2 weeks after 30% total body surface full-thickness burns. The wounds of 53 animals were seeded with 10(8) nonvirulent P. aeruginosa (NVP) at the time of injury, while the wounds of 33 rats were allowed to colonize spontaneously. The seeded wounds contained 10(6) colony forming units/gm (CFU/gm) by the fourth postburn day (PBD), while the unseeded wounds did not reach this level of colonization until after the first week postinjury. Wound seeding accelerated the metabolic and thermoregulatory responses to injury. Average VO2 and Tc of the seeded group were above the unseeded group on PBD's 3-4 and 7-8, but there were no significant differences between groups on PBD's 14-15. Although the unseeded animals were hypermetabolic during the first week, they remained afebrile. There was a significant correlation between wound bacterial counts and the increase in resting VO2 of 44 nonbacteremic animals, but variations in the data suggest that factors other than number of viable wound bacteria affect this relationship. Changes in Tc were unrelated to wound bacterial count but were correlated with changes in VO2. Taken together, the data suggest that bacteria in the burn wound contribute to the rise in energy expenditure following thermal injury.\r"

In this study, we examined the acute cerebral effects of a hypertonic lactated Ringer's solution (measured osmolality = 469 mOsm/kg) in an animal model of traumatic brain injury. Following the production of a cerebral cryogenic lesion, eight New Zealand white rabbits were randomized to undergo hemodilution with either lactated Ringer's (measured osmolality = 254 mOsm/kg) or hypertonic lactated Ringer's. Over the course of the experiment the lactated Ringer's group required significantly more fluid than the hypertonic group to maintain stable central venous and mean arterial pressure (245 +/- 5 ml vs. 132 +/- 20 ml; p less than 0.0001). Osmolality increased in the hypertonic group by 13.5 +/- 3.3 mOsm/kg whereas it decreased in the lactated Ringer's group by 5.5 +/- 2.6 mOsm/kg. Intracranial pressure increased in both groups over the course of the experiment but the increase in pressure was greater in the lactated Ringer's group than the hypertonic group (9.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg vs. 1.7 +/- 1.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Brain water content was significantly increased in the region of the lesion as assayed by both the wet/dry weight method and cortical specific gravity determinations, but there was no difference between the two treatment groups. Water content of the nonlesioned hemisphere was significantly less in the hypertonic group. This study suggests that hypertonic saline solutions may be useful for the resuscitation of hypovolemic patients with localized brain injury.\r"

The mortality rate for all grades of injury rose from approximately 1% in the age group less than 20 years old to almost 11% in the age group more than 70.

In addition, it makes patients comfortable in multiple trauma conditions. The average time to union and removal of fixators was 72 days (range, 44 to 80 days). There were no deep wound infections, nonunions, or rotationary deformities. On followup, all patients regained the range of motion of knee joints in 3 months without significant leg length discrepancy or radiographic evidence of growth disturbance. The device may serve as an alternative method for femoral shaft fractures in prepuberty, especially in areas of tropical climate.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with penetrating wounds of the back were prospectively evaluated and managed selectively on the basis of physical examination. Despite the theoretic problems of evaluating the retroperitoneum, physical examination was found to be a reliable method of determining the need for laparotomy. Every patient who had a significant injury had evidence for this on initial physical examination and no patient judged to have a normal examination required laparotomy. The negative laparotomy rate was 4% and no patients died as a result of delayed surgical intervention. Careful physical examination and surgical judgment allow for safe management of penetrating back wounds.\r"

  ".U": "89217011\r", 
  ".W": "Acute axillary or groin vascular injuries caused by farm machinery or shotgun blasts are often associated with extensive soft-tissue loss. Coverage of the repaired blood vessels with healthy tissue is necessary to avoid infection, desiccation, pseudoaneurysm, and rupture. Adjacent muscles are not always available to rotate for coverage, due to unacceptable functional loss, or injury to the principal vascular pedicle. We used proximally based trunk musculature with vascular pedicles out of the areas of injury to achieve coverage of four extensive axillary wounds and one extensive groin wound. Arterial repair only was performed in three axillary wounds. Combined arterial and venous repair were performed in one groin wound and one axillary wound. Followup ranging from 9 months to 5 years revealed no vascular failure or soft-tissue complications. We conclude that coverage of vascular repairs and soft-tissue defects with viable muscle is necessary in cases of extensive injury. Adjacent muscle is preferred for coverage, but when this is unavailable, coverage can still be achieved using more proximally pedicled muscles of the trunk.\r"

Furthermore, the usual tests for the applicability of either legal or medical measures often cannot be applied to the dually diagnosed. Specific quandaries arise with involuntary hospitalization and treatment, and with evaluating patients for the courts. The author discusses these problems, introducing the concept of state-dependent competency, using a case vignette to illustrate several points. Legal theories of behavior assume freedom of action; medical theories assume determinism. Phenomena of addiction defy such distinctions and thus may pose difficulties that cannot reliably be assigned either a medical or a legal remedy.\r"

An examination of admissions data for the city, state, and nation indicated that our experience was typical. However, data from the most recent national household survey indicate that, to the extent need for treatment is determined by frequency of cocaine use, we should anticipate a much greater proportion of admissions to treatment to come from persons 21 years of age and younger. Yet, there appears to be an under-recruitment of youth into treatment, particularly evidenced by low rates of self-referral for juvenile as compared to older treatment admissions. Younger cocaine users may be less severely impaired and/or dependent, or may be more reluctant to use the treatment resources available. Whatever the barriers are to getting help, it becomes the special task of agencies and individuals in the community to help assure that younger cocaine users will obtain the assistance they need. Four community resources are seen as particularly relevant: family, schools, the medical community, and public agencies in the areas of health, social services, and criminal justice. The capacity of each to take action and possible impediments to that action are discussed.\r"

Results are presented through comprehensive description of the sample across these patient and psychometric characteristics with use of summary statistics.

Eighty-seven male alcoholics were exposed to one hour of instruction on the medical effects of alcohol. Sociodemographic, alcohol-related, and cognitive functioning measures were obtained at the outset of treatment. Knowledge was assessed 24 hours prior to and 24 hours and three weeks after the intervention. Statistically significant increases in knowledge were found both 24 hours and three weeks following the educational intervention; retention of information declined significantly from 24 hours to three weeks post-intervention. Discriminant function analyses using either seven cognitive variables or six alcohol-related/sociodemographic variables significantly discriminated between learners and nonlearners 24 hours after the intervention. The weighted composite of measures in each of the analyses was able to successfully differentiate learners from nonlearners in over 70% of the cases. The findings suggest that the clinician may be able to employ a limited number of variables to differentiate between patients who will and will not be able to acquire knowledge from educational interventions.\r"

The relatively high abstention rate - 40.9% of all patients (51.2% of those who completed treatment) - is the most important result of the study.

When abstinence is stabilized, then psychodynamic principles can be integrated into an approach that recognizes the role played by potential return to substance abuse. Abstinence is even more critical in dual diagnosis patients than in uncomplicated substance abusers. In advanced recovery, more traditional psychotherapy can be done, particularly in nonpsychotic patients.\r"

Serum prostatic acid phosphatase by radioimmunoassay was unable to distinguish men with stages C plus D1 from B2 plus B3 disease but it could distinguish stages C plus D1 from A2 plus B1 (p equals 0.015). Serum prostate specific antigen was directly proportional to increasing Gleason score. In 59 untreated patients multiple prostate specific antigen values were obtained during a mean followup of 10 months. Of the patients 81 per cent showed a steady increase with time, including 91 per cent of men with clinical stage B2 or greater disease. The rate of increase accelerated with time, and correlated with advancing tumor stage and increasing serum concentration of prostate specific antigen. The rate of increase of prostate specific antigen in clinical stages A and B cancer patients suggested a doubling time of at least 2 years. Serum prostate specific antigen was significantly decreased by transurethral resection of prostatic tissue in patients with cancer, as has been shown previously in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Serum prostate specific antigen was determined (Yang polyclonal radioimmunoassay) in 102 men before hospitalization for radical prostatectomy. Prostate specimens were subjected to detailed histological and morphometric analysis. Levels of prostate specific antigen were significantly different between patients with and without a Gleason score of 7 or greater (p less than 0.001), capsular penetration greater than 1 cm. in linear extent (p less than 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (p less than 0.001) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (p less than 0.005). Prostate specific antigen was strongly correlated with volume of prostate cancer (r equals 0.70). Bivariate and multivariate analyses indicate that cancer volume is the primary determinant of serum prostate specific antigen levels. Prostate specific antigen was elevated 3.5 ng. per ml. for every cc of cancer, a level at least 10 times that observed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Prostate specific antigen is useful as a preoperative marker because no patient with lymph node metastasis had serum levels of less than 10 ng. per ml. (4 times the upper limit of normal range). Of the patients with greater than 50 ng. per ml. two-thirds had microscopic lymph node metastasis and 90 per cent had seminal vesicle invasion. Serum prostatic acid phosphatase levels showed a significantly weaker correlation with cancer volume (r equals 0.51) and every other pathological parameter. Of the patients 73 per cent had serum prostatic acid phosphatase levels in the normal range (0 to 2.1 ng. per ml.), including 7 per cent who had pelvic lymph node metastasis. Postoperative prostate specific antigen values were available in 97 of 102 patients, with a mean and maximum followup of 12 and 38 months. No patient with pelvic lymph node metastasis achieved an undetectable prostate specific antigen level without adjunctive therapy (hormonal or radiation). No difference in preoperative or postoperative prostate specific antigen levels, cancer volume, seminal vesicle invasion or incidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis was seen between patients with no capsular penetration and those with minimal capsular penetration (1 cm. or less total linear extent of full thickness penetration), providing the first quantitative evidence that small amounts of capsular penetration may not be of biological or prognostic significance.\r"

The majority of the patients demonstrated an initial, often dramatic decrease in prostate specific antigen levels during the first 6 months after introduction of therapy. After 6 months 21 of 29 patients (72 per cent) had increasing prostate specific antigen levels.

Based on our preliminary results from 1977 to 1983, in which none of the 221 patients with blunt trauma and microscopic hematuria without shock had significant renal injuries, we designed a prospective study to determine if such patients could be managed safely without radiographic staging. During the last 10 years significant renal injuries were found in 44 patients (4.4 per cent) with blunt trauma and gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria associated with shock, and in 88 patients (63 per cent) with penetrating trauma. No significant injuries occurred in the 812 patients with blunt trauma and microscopic hematuria without shock, 404 of whom had complete radiographic assessment and 408 of whom did not. There were no delayed operations or significant sequelae related to the renal injury in these patients. We conclude that complete radiographic staging is mandatory in patients with penetrating trauma to the flank or abdomen and in patients with blunt trauma associated with either gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria and shock. However, patients with blunt trauma, microscopic hematuria and no shock who do not have associated major intra-abdominal injuries can be managed safely without excretory urography.\r"

  ".W": "The greater frequency of renal stones seen on excretory urograms in women, compared with the greater frequency of ureteral stones in men has been termed a sexual paradox. We assessed stone composition and weight, and sex as possible explanatory factors. A total of 4,014 renal and ureteral calculi was analyzed. For the 3,119 calculi in which only calcium oxalate and/or phosphate was detected by infrared and wet chemical analysis, there was a strong relationship between the oxalate-to-phosphate weight ratio and sex (p less than 0.0001). The mean weight for phosphate stones was 330 mg. but for oxalate stones it was 107 mg. Male-to-female ratios were 2.7, 2.2 and 1.8 for stone weight groups of 20 or less, 21 to 100 and more than 100 mg. The male-to-female ratio was 0.87 for the 171 stones containing magnesium ammonium phosphate; the average weight was 508 mg. for men and 1,560 mg. for women. The tendency for phosphate stones to be heavier and relatively more common in women compared to predominantly oxalate stones may partly account for the sexual paradox.\r"

Of the patients 51 were followed for at least 5 years or until they died (median followup 11 years); 5 patients were lost to followup. The most common site was the retroperitoneum. Liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma were the most common tumors (74 per cent). Tumors were completely resected in 42 patients (68 per cent) and incompletely resected in 11, while a biopsy only was performed in 9. Some patients also received adjuvant radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. There were no long-term survivors among patients with unresectable tumors. Over-all 3 and 5-year survival rates were 68 and 39 per cent, respectively. The histological type of the tumor appeared to have prognostic significance. The highest 5-year survivals were for liposarcoma (70 per cent), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (33 per cent) and leiomyosarcoma (13 per cent). The mean survival for patients after adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy was similar to that after a radical operation alone. The primary cause of treatment failure was local recurrence (45 per cent of the patients), which was detected within 3 years of complete resection in most cases (82 per cent). Complete extirpation that provided adequate margins free of tumor was the most effective initial treatment and provided the best chance for cure.\r"

Reflux was prevented by an intussusception valve. There was no operative mortality and few early complications. At followup the mean postoperative observation time was 13 months, with a range of 5 to 20 months. Late complications included manifestations of local tumor recurrence or distant metastases in 9 patients within 6 months postoperatively, which made adequate functional evaluation impossible. In 18 patients reflux to the upper urinary tract due to eversion or sliding of the antireflux valve occurred at various postoperative intervals. In 16 of these patients incontinence developed as a consequence of the reflux. Surgical correction of the failing antireflux valve restored reflux prevention and continence. Within 3 to 6 months the capacity of the reservoirs had reached an ultimate volume of approximately 600 ml. Pressure waves exceeding 40 cm. water seldom occurred in the mature reservoirs and then only at high filling volumes. The mean urethral resting resistance to flow was 64 cm. water. The configuration and function of the upper urinary tract improved or stabilized postoperatively. Of 34 evaluable patients 30 were continent during the day with a voiding frequency of 3 to 5 times and dry at night with a frequency of 0 to 2.\r"

Patients who received lidocaine plus cocaine reported a mean score of 3.33 for over-all discomfort of cystoscopy. This was not significantly different than for lidocaine alone. This finding indicates a lack of a summation effect in combining topical anesthetics. Patients undergoing repeat examinations were no more comfortable than those undergoing initial cystoscopy but older patients tolerated the procedure significantly better than younger patients.\r"

A prostate biopsy was recommended if induration, asymmetry or nodules were detected on the digital examination. During a 6-year period 4,160 examinations were performed on 2,131 men more than 45 years old. A prostate biopsy was performed on 144 men and 36 malignant tumors were detected, of which 68 per cent were clinically localized. Pelvic lymph node metastases were found in 6 per cent of the surgically staged cancer patients and in 10 per cent of the patients who had a high grade tumor. Surgical staging revealed that 50 per cent of the patients with clinical stage B disease were upstaged to stage C or D1 disease. These results suggest that mass screening programs using digital examination may not add sufficient benefit over conventional medical care to warrant the expense. Definitive proof that screening can lower the mortality rate from prostate cancer can be obtained only by a prospective randomized clinical trial.\r"

The etiology of the neuropathic bladder was myelodysplasia in 16 patients and sacral agenesis in 2. There were 10 boys and 8 girls. All patients had failed trials of clean intermittent catheterization with adjunctive pharmacological manipulation. Incontinence was a significant social problem. Of the 18 patients 2 had undergone prior urinary diversion and the Kropp procedure was used as part of undiversion. One patient had had 2 previous failed attempts at continence using an artificial urinary sphincter. Augmentation cystoplasty was an adjunctive maneuver in 14 patients; ileum was used in 8, sigmoid in 4 and the ileocecum in 2 (both of whom had been diverted previously). The bladder capacity in the 4 patients in whom augmentation was not performed ranged from 200 to 450 ml. Of the 18 patients 17 achieved a good result and 14 were considered to have achieved an excellent result. The 1 failure is the patient who previously had failed to gain control with an artificial sphincter.

The results showed that all 7 cases of monorchism had normal numbers of spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule. However, in 29 cases of a retractile testis a normal testis was observed in 13 (44.8 per cent). Therefore testicular dysgenesis is suggested to exist in more than half of cases of the retractile testis. Of 150 cases of cryptorchidism 82 were bilateral and 68 were unilateral. There was no significant difference in the number of spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule between these 2 groups. The higher the testes were located the worse the ratio of spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule. Fewer or absent spermatogonia were observed in 2 patients less than 2 years old. Of 28 contralateral scrotal testes in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism 4 (14.3 per cent) had no spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule and 8 (28.0 per cent) had a decreased number of spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule. The male intersex patients had much damage even in the scrotal testes. From these results it is suggested that these congenital testicular disorders, except monorchism, have similar histological features. Moreover, these conditions are possibly related in etiology to the phenomenon of deficient androgen stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were carried out to compare the effects of diabetes mellitus and castration on the muscarinic responsiveness of rat vasa deferentia. One and two months after castration or after streptozotocin-induced diabetes, there were significant decreases in serum testosterone levels, accompanied by significant decreases in vas deferens weights, protein contents, and protein concentrations. However, contractile responses of vasa deferentia from streptozotocin-diabetic or castrated rats to carbachol were significantly increased compared to controls. These changes were accompanied by increases in Kd and decreases in Bmax (pm/tissue) for 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding. Contractile responses and QNB binding were also studied in the spontaneously diabetic BB/W or rat, a less severely diabetic model than the streptozotocin-diabetic rat. Ninety days after the onset of diabetes in the BB rat, there was an increase in the contractile response to carbachol. There were qualitatively similar but smaller changes in vas deferens weights, protein contents, protein concentrations, and QNB binding than in the streptozotocin-diabetic rats. The data show that diabetes and castration increased the contractile responses of vasa deferentia despite decreases in protein content and in the number of muscarinic receptors. The results suggest that muscarinic receptor-effector coupling is more efficient in vasa deferentia from castrated or diabetic rats, resulting in a greater contractile response to cholinergic agonists.\r"

  ".W": "The role of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors in the prostate in vivo is unknown. A model was developed to measure canine prostatic urethral pressure in vivo, and to assess the ability of various alpha adrenergic blocking agents to affect prostatic pressure. In this model, an esophogeal pressure catheter is inserted into the prostatic urethra to record prostatic urethral pressure. We investigated the effects of alpha adrenergic agonists and antagonists on prostatic pressure using this model. Dose-response curves were generated for epinephrine, and were then repeated in the presence of either prazosin (alpha 1 antagonist), yohimbine (alpha 2 antagonist) or SK&F-86466 (alpha 2 antagonist). Prazosin was the most potent of the three drugs in competitively blocking epinephrine-induced contraction of the prostate, with an inhibition constant of 0.24 micrograms./kg. calculated from the double reciprocal plot. Clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, caused contraction of the prostate, which was also blocked by prazosin. Furthermore, the specific alpha 2 agonist BHT-920 was totally inactive in our system. These results demonstrate that the increase in urethral pressure caused by alpha-adrenergic agonists can be blocked by alpha adrenergic antagonists. However, the specific alpha 1 antagonist, prazosin, is more potent than alpha 2 antagonists, and is also effective against an alpha 2 agonist, clonidine. This suggests that blockade of alpha 1 receptors may be a more useful strategy for causing relaxation of the prostate than blockade of alpha 2 receptors.\r"

The results were analysed according to the stage of the disease and the malignancy grade of the carcinoma. There were statistically significant differences in the activities of three enzymes between various stages and grades. The activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH), and phosphohexose isomerase (PHI) showed significant decreases with increased stage and grade. Of the total of 64 patients with superficial disease at presentation, five developed progressive disease during the course of this investigation. The activities of the three enzymes in these patients were compared to the median values for the group of patients with superficial disease. The activity of PFK was observed to be below the median value in all the five patients whereas the activities of alpha-GPDH and PHI showed similar patterns in four of the five patients. These preliminary data indicate that, in association with established clinical parameters, the measurement of the activity of these three enzymes may prove useful in selecting patients with an increased potential for developing progressive disease.\r"

Endogenous and exogenous TGF-beta may influence cell proliferation through autocrine and paracrine binding to specific TGF-beta receptors. Growth effects of TGF-beta on human renal cell carcinoma cell lines have not been thus far described. We have studied the effects of TGF-beta on one renal tumor-derived (UOK-39) and one established (SKRC-7) renal cell carcinoma cell line. Exogenous addition of biologically active TGF-beta to cell cultures at concentrations between two and five ng./ml. inhibited the anchorage-dependent growth of UOK-39 by 75% and SKRC-7 by 44%, relative to controls. Low numbers of high affinity TGF-beta receptors were identified on both cell lines in 125I-TGF-beta binding assays. UOK-39 cells bound radiolabeled TGF-beta with higher affinity than SKRC-7 cells, but had fewer receptor sites, by Scatchard analysis of binding data. These results suggest that TGF-beta inhibits proliferation of renal carcinoma cells in vitro which may be mediated through binding of exogenous TGF-beta to functional TGF-beta receptors on the cell surface.\r"

Over a period of 21 days transurethral bladder fillings were performed every second day on the same animal. Analysis of the bladder volume at an intravesical pressure of 10 and 20 mm. Hg and at the leakage point showed no trend during the 21 day study period with regard to changes in bladder volume. The model has been applied to a group of mice treated with a single fraction bladder irradiation dose of 20 Gy. These mice were investigated repeatedly during the following year. The end point selected for data evaluation in the irradiated group of mice was a 50% decrease in bladder volume at an intravesical pressure of 20 mm. Hg relative to the control value (bladder volume before irradiation). The results clearly demonstrate a biphasic change in the bladder reservoir function, in the form of an acute, reversible change, a period of normalization and then a late irreversible damage. The latter stage is consistent with the clinically found contracted bladder. In a control group there was no significant change in bladder volume during the study period of more than 200 days. The model thus appears feasible for future studies of bladder irradiation damage.\r"

Rabbits were treated with 3,000 shock waves at 18 kV to each kidney. Blood and urine samples were collected daily before and after shock wave treatment. Serum levels of hemoglobin, creatinine, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and total protein were determined. Urine determination of volume, total protein, hemoglobin, and creatinine were also made. All kidneys, after sacrifice, were subjected to histologic analysis. The average pre-treatment creatinine clearance of our rabbits was 8.3 ml./min. After the treatment, a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in creatinine clearance was noted for four days. The reduction was to 0.61 ml./min. on day one, 0.87 on day two, 1.04 on day three, and so forth. Urine hemoglobin rose significantly (p less than 0.01) for the first three days from 0.0 to 1.5 gm./dl. Histologic examination at seven days showed focal subcapsular hemorrhage, tubular dilation, and interstitial hemorrhage. Histologic evaluation at two months revealed focal interstitial fibrosis. In conclusion, this study reveals that shock waves to the kidney have short term physiologic effects on renal function and permanent focal histologic effects, which do not effect long term physiologic function. Further research on the effects of ESWL on renal function and structure could be facilitated with the use of this model.\r"

  ".W": "Molecules and macromolecules are known to alter the process of crystallization, either through inhibition or promotion of nucleation, growth, and/or aggregation. One particular group of macromolecules, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), has been of interest in our laboratory. The GAGs chondroitin A, chondroitin C, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfate have all been shown to be inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization. Heparin, the only GAG which is not naturally present in urine, is the most potent inhibitor of all GAGs. Using the method of Langmuir isotherm adsorption, we studied the adsorption of certain GAGs onto calcium oxalate crystals. Under standardized conditions, heparin, chondroitin C, hyaluronic acid, and pentosan polysulfate (a synthetic polyanionic molecule similar to, but a weaker inhibitor than, heparin) were adsorbed onto calcium oxalate. The total amount of GAG required to maximally cover the crystal surface, as well as the equilibrium concentration at which surface was half-covered with GAG (inversely related to the desorption energy) were measured. Chondroitin C was adsorbed in the greatest amount, followed by heparin, pentosan polysulfate, and finally hyaluronic acid. Using the method of fiducial limits, the only insignificant difference was between heparin and chondroitin C, and between hyaluronic acid and pentosan polysulfate. Pentosan polysulfate required significantly higher equilibrium concentration than heparin and hyaluronic acid to cover half of the surface of the calcium oxalate crystals. The principle of Langmuir isotherm adsorption can be useful in predicting the effects of macromolecules on crystallization. Weaker inhibitors bind with less affinity than do stronger inhibitors. Further work is underway to characterize other inhibitors and promoters.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the perioperative outcomes and the immediate increases in size after patch closure, 140 carotid endarterectomies were randomized into one of three groups: direct no-patch closure, saphenous vein patch closure, and polytetrafluoroethylene patch closure. Seven patients (4.4%) experienced signs of cerebral ischemia in the immediate postoperative period. In three cases this was transient and reversible. In the other four reexploration was undertaken and carotid thrombosis was corrected by thrombectomy. The condition of one of these patients deteriorated to a permanent stroke, whereas the other patients made a complete recovery. Neurologic complications were more frequent in the no-patch group, but the differences between the groups were not significant. The incidence of perioperative internal carotid stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, and other morphologic abnormalities was assessed in 131 intravenous digital subtraction angiograms taken before the patient was discharged from the hospital. Eight (17.0%) of the endarterectomies in the no-patch group were narrowed by 30% to 50% diameter stenosis, whereas none of the patched arteries had more than 30% stenosis. In contrast, dilatation of the common or internal carotid artery to more than twice the measured diameter was absent in non-patched arteries but was present in seven (17.0%) saphenous patch closures and four (9.23%) polytetrafluoroethylene patch closures. We conclude that patch closure after carotid endarterectomy is less likely to cause stenosis in the perioperative period. Poly-tetrafluoroethylene patches resist dilatation better than do saphenous vein patches and are less likely to become aneurysmal.\r"

Ten patients with chronic renal failure had side-to-side radial artery/cephalic vein fistulas fused by laser. Incisions 1.2 to 1.5 cm in length were made in adjacent segments of artery and vein and were aligned for application of laser energy by four 6-0 polypropylene sutures. The sutures divided each fistula into four segments that were 5.0 to 6.5 mm long. Each segment was sealed satisfactorily in 75 to 100 seconds by use of 0.5 W, 1130 to 1520 joule/cm2 argon laser energy fluence. Seven (17.5%) of 40 bonds required an additional 7-0 biodegradable suture to close small gaps that did not fuse adequately. Serial prospective follow-up studies of the patients by physical examination and duplex scanning for periods of 12 to 20 months (15.4 +/- 2.8, n = 7) postoperatively have shown uniformly patent, compliant anastomoses with no evidence of hematomas, false aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination of two patent fistulas that were excised during revision procedures at 4 and 5 months postoperatively showed healing of the entire circumference of the anastomosis similar to that noted in extensive preclinical canine studies. We conclude from these preliminary results that argon laser vascular tissue fusion is possible in humans when reliable primary sealing of vascular anastomoses is achieved, and that healing occurs without aneurysmal dilatation during follow-up of up to 20 months.\r"

In this study, patients with carotid endarterectomy were pretreated with oral beta carotene to determine if the carotenoid content and therefore laser selectivity of plaque could be increased in vivo. Beta carotene-treated patients had a significant, nearly twofold increase in their plaque carotenoid concentration, which increased from 0.22 to 0.40 microgram beta carotene/mg cholesterol. These results suggest that selective ablation of atherosclerotic plaque may be enhanced by pretreating patients with doses of oral beta carotene for short periods of time.\r"

One patient had paraplegia, and the other had mild paraparesis but completely recovered. Both patients were operated on for ruptured aneurysms. Four patients (7.5%) had severe postoperative renal dysfunction that was strongly related to intraoperative hypotension. The cumulative proportional survival rate was 81% at 1 year and 66% at 2 years for the total group. 85% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years for the patients first seen with nonruptured aneurysms. Aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta can be safely resected without the use of shunting or bypass techniques. Surgery definitely improves the outcome for these patients who have a poor prognosis if left untreated.\r"
