The ferning test is proposed for this purpose. An in vitro model, using centrifuged serial dilutions of neonatal cord blood and amniotic fluid, showed that ferning of the supernatant occurs in proportion to the degree of contamination. A system for grading ferning was devised, and tested in a blind trial. For the detection of amniotic fluid contamination of 10% or more, the method showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 81%. The method may be useful in percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, and in the diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of membranes with vaginal bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "To define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ritodrine after intramuscular injection, we administered 5 or 10 mg ritodrine into the gluteus or deltoid muscles of 12 pregnant volunteers. Six women received 5 mg and six received 10 mg into each muscle group on different days. We withdrew blood samples before and 12 times in the 6 hours after ritodrine injection. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at each time. Ritodrine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak ritodrine concentrations (mean +/- SD) after a single 5 mg injection in the deltoid or gluteus were 38 +/- 13 and 26 +/- 8 ng/ml, respectively. After a 10 mg dose in the deltoid or gluteus, peak concentrations were 59 +/- 30 and 47 +/- 22 ng/ml, respectively. Although higher, the peak plasma concentrations after injections into the deltoid were not significantly greater than those after injection into the gluteus. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters differed according to dose or injection site. The pharmacodynamic effects of ritodrine were unaffected by injection site, but ritodrine caused a dose-related increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and a dose-related decrease in diastolic blood pressure. After a 10 mg injection, the maximal changes in heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were 22%, 10%, and 19%, respectively. However, mean blood pressure was not altered by either the 5 or 10 mg dose. These findings indicate that there are few differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between deltoid and gluteal injection of ritodrine. The single intramuscular injection of 5 or 10 mg ritodrine results in labor-inhibiting concentrations with clinically insignificant cardiovascular effects.\r"

Six losses occurred in the first or second trimester. Thirty-nine viable infants were born to 37 women and include one set of fraternal twins. Three of the singleton newborns weighed less than 2500 gm; newborn morbidity after preterm delivery occurred in one case. Women with complications (n = 14) were similar in maternal age, education, parity, annual income, marital status, and smoking history to women without complications (n = 24).

Mean menstrual blood loss in women with a bleeding disorder was 219 ml (range, 60 to 568 ml); five women had menorrhagia. In women treated with oral anticoagulant therapy, mean menstrual blood loss was 98 ml (range, 9 to 239 ml), and five women had menorrhagia. Of the six women with normal menstrual blood losses, two had losses in the high normal range (60 to 80 ml). No correlation existed between anticoagulant state and menstrual blood loss. The data support the close association between bleeding disorders and menorrhagia and suggest that oral anticoagulants increase menstrual blood loss.\r"

All those with polypoidal or submucous leiomyomas exhibited moderately heavy or excessively heavy bleeding, and so did many of those with superficial intramural or subserous myomas. The highest rate of detection of endometriosis was in women with moderately heavy blood loss, rather than excessive or normal (54% compared with 29% and 23%, respectively), and such women were more likely to have mild stage disease than severe. Other pelvic abnormalities such as adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, pelvic inflammatory disease, and some rarities were also characterized. It is contended that the era of routine, blind diagnostic curettage is now passed, and should be replaced by outpatient or office hysteroscopy accompanied by directed biopsy or curettage.\r"

Treatment was performed at the time of initial assessment with the patient under a local anesthetic. Treatment proved acceptable to patients and minimal discomfort was reported. Primary hemorrhage was not a problem, although secondary hemorrhage occurred in 3.7% of patients. Excision was histologically complete in 85% of cases, and excision was clinically complete in the remaining cases. Diathermy coagulation to the base of the lesion ensured hemostasis and destroyed any residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Follow-up cytologic findings were normal in 91% of patients at 3 months, and colposcopy showed no abnormality in 95% of patients at 6 months. The squamocolumnar junction was fully visible in 91% of patients. Thus excisional techniques with the low-voltage diathermy loop appear to be a viable treatment option for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

The remaining seven patients have remained without evidence of recurrent disease. Of the 10 total patients severe radionecrosis developed in six at a median of 8.5 months (6 to 26 months) after radiotherapy.

Resistance-size mesenteric arteries were removed from late pregnant (18 to 20 days), early pregnant (7 days), and nonpregnant cycling rats and mounted in a myograph system, which permits the precise setting of vessel circumference for the determination of norepinephrine sensitivity. Norepinephrine dose-response curves and frequency-response curves for transmural nerve stimulation were obtained in the presence and absence of cocaine, a specific inhibitor of neuronal reuptake. The mesenteric arteries of late pregnant rats were 1.5 times less sensitive to exogenous norepinephrine than arteries of both early pregnant and nonpregnant rats. Sensitivity to transmural nerve stimulation was decreased in both early and late pregnant rats compared with nonpregnant controls. Cocaine potentiated the response to both exogenous norepinephrine and transmural nerve stimulation in the pregnant rats so that responses between nonpregnant, early pregnant, and late pregnant rats were no longer different. This suggests a greater reuptake activity from pregnant rats. In conclusion, pregnancy is associated with a reduction in splanchnic norepinephrine sensitivity, which may be due partly to an increase in neuronal deactivation of norepinephrine. The maximum contractile response to norepinephrine also was decreased in late pregnancy, which suggests additional mechanisms for changes in norepinephrine vascular sensitivity.\r"

Hexokinase activity in single oocytes was 17.9 +/- 3.6 pmol of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate formed/oocyte/hr at 20 degrees C. Specific activity was estimated to be 104 +/- 30 nmol/mg protein/hr, which was remarkably lower than that in human spermatozoa (3570 +/- 550 nmol/mg protein/hr) and other somatic cells such as endometrium, brain, liver, and kidney. Mouse follicular oocytes and early embryos before the two-cell stage also had low hexokinase activities, but morulae and blastocysts had increasingly high activities; the former cannot use glucose as an energy source, whereas the latter can. These results suggest that human immature oocytes, as well as mouse oocytes, depend on pyruvate instead of glucose as a major energy source.\r"

At 1, 4, 8, or 24 hours later fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, and were fixed immediately by the whole-body freezing technique. The ductus diameter, pericardial effusion, and volume and mass of the ventricles were studied by photographing multiple planes of the heart. Fetal ductal constriction was most remarkable with ibuprofen, with the diameter decreased 70% +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM) at 1 to 8 hours. Both ventricles were dilated 60% +/- 27%, and pericardial fluid was increased 120% +/- 20%. These changes partly disappeared at 24 hours. Milder but more persistent effects were observed with indomethacin. The fetal ductus was constricted 30% at 4 to 24 hours. Pericardial fluid was increased 140% +/- 30% at 24 hours. Aspirin and acetaminophen constricted the fetal ductus 10%. In conclusion, clinical doses of ibuprofen and indomethacin constricted the fetal rat ductus and caused cardiac failure. The effects of aspirin and acetaminophen were much milder.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnant sheep are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of bupivacaine, a potent local anesthetic, than are nonpregnant sheep. In contrast, ovine pregnancy does not enhance the toxicity of mepivacaine, a drug with properties similar to lidocaine. We studied the central nervous and cardiovascular toxicity of lidocaine in pregnant sheep receiving a continuous intravenous drug infusion at the rate of 2 mg/kg/min and compared our results with data previously obtained in nonpregnant ewes. In all animals, toxic manifestations occurred in the following sequence: convulsions, hypotension, respiratory arrest, and circulatory collapse. The doses of lidocaine required to produce these symptoms in pregnant and nonpregnant ewes were similar. Convulsions occurred at 5.9 +/- 0.6 mg/kg (mean +/- SE) in the pregnant ewe and 5.8 +/- 1.8 mg/kg in the nonpregnant ewe, whereas circulatory collapse occurred at 40.7 +/- 2.6 and 36.7 +/- 3.3 mg/kg in the pregnant and nonpregnant animals, respectively. Lidocaine plasma concentrations associated with the onset of convulsions in both pregnant and nonpregnant ewes were almost identical (12.1 +/- 0.7 and 11.7 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). At circulatory collapse, these concentrations were 35.1 +/- 3.2 and 41.2 +/- 6.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. It appears that pregnancy does not enhance the toxic effects of lidocaine. These findings are similar to those for mepivacaine but not for bupivacaine, and may be related in part to differences in the way pregnancy affects serum protein binding of these drugs.\r"

These mechanisms are available for a limited time and eventually the fetus is no longer able to maintain preferential perfusion and decompensation occurs. To identify the relationship between hypoxemia with severe acidemia and the breakdown of circulatory compensation, we decreased uterine blood flow in 10 chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. We measured fetal blood gases and pH, arterial and central venous pressures, heart rate, combined ventricular output, and regional blood flow distribution during hypoxemia with severe acidemia and when a fixed-baseline sustained bradycardia (agonal) heart rate pattern developed. Hypoxemia with severe acidemia was characterized by markedly decreased blood flow to most organs; however, the preferential perfusion of the brain, heart, adrenal gland, and placenta was still present. An agonal heart rate pattern was characterized by complete cardiovascular collapse. This study demonstrates that circulatory compensation is present in fetal sheep affected by deficiency of oxygen delivery despite hypoxemia with severe acidemia.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen ovine fetuses underwent either ligation or excision of the left thoracic, left cervical, and left brachiocephalic lymphatic ducts. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that interruption of lymphatic flow would lead to hydropic changes in the ovine fetus. Of the 11 animals in the group that underwent ligation, hydrops developed in 1. All five of the fetuses that underwent excision of these major lymphatic ducts were hydropic at the time of autopsy (3 to 7 days), with 62 to 502 ml of free fluid collected from the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The mean edema fluid total protein concentration in the hydropic fetuses was 2.6 gm/dl. This value was 71% to 94% of that found in the plasma, suggesting that the fetus is capable of producing new plasma proteins at a high rate. The observation that lymphatic excision led to hydropic changes in the ovine fetus, whereas ligation did not consistently produce hydrops, suggests that fetal lymph vessels may be capable of very rapid regrowth over short distances. Thus lymphatic excision, but not ligation, produces an animal model for the study of hydrops fetalis.\r"

Of those tested prior to service, 15/298 (5%) were seropositive for HAV. Those tested at 1-12 months showed 48/417 (11.3%) seropositivity, while 72/529 (13.6%) of those with greater than 12 months of service had antibody to HAV. Only 3/80 (3.8%) of those seropositive PCVs who received their IG injections at least every 6 months were documented to have shown clinical signs of HAV infection during service. This compares to 6/30 (20%) of those who had received irregular prophylaxis (P = 0.01, Fisher's exact test, 2-tailed). Significant numbers of PCVs are subclinically infected with HAV overseas and increasingly develop active immunity with greater length of service.\r"

Thirty-five pools of Culicoides ssp. and 48 pools of mosquitoes obtained in conjunction with the infected sand flies also were evaluated for VSNJ virus; all were negative. Concomitant serologic monitoring of sentinel swine indicated that VSNJ virus transmission began in late April and continued through the completion of this study in August. The incidence of seroconversion among the sentinel wild swine was 50%. Domestic sentinel swine did not seroconvert at 2 sentinel sites, 1 of 2 seroconverted at 1 site, and 2 of 2 seroconverted at the fourth site. Vesicular lesions were seen on 10 sentinel wild swine during the summer. Vesicular stomatitis virus (NJ) was isolated from 4 of these swine and was diagnosed in 1 additional swine by direct complement-fixation assay. The time period within which VSNJ virus was isolated from sand flies preceded detection of vesicular lesions but corresponded with the period of seroconversion in sentinel swine. Site specific data indicated that VSNJ virus activity was widespread within the study area.\r"

  ".W": "A semi-isolated population of Culex tarsalis in Kern County, CA was found to vary significantly in its seasonal and yearly susceptibility to peroral infection with western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses during the breeding seasons of 1975-1981. Female cohorts of the population were significantly more resistant to WEE virus from 1975 through 1977 than from 1978 through 1981. On the average, females were 40 times more susceptible to WEE virus during May than during August. Increases in resistance correlated significantly with the number of days accrued from April through June, when daily ambient air temperatures equaled or exceeded 26.7 degrees C or 32.2 degrees C, respectively. Analyses of data on WEE viral susceptibility, temperature, and rainfall for the 7 year period suggested that Cx. tarsalis should be most susceptible to infection in years with wet winter-early spring periods followed by cool springs. However, inconsistencies in the expression of WEE viral susceptibility during mid- to late summer of some years indicated that other unidentified extrinsic factors, in addition to temperature and rainfall, may induce changes during preimaginal development that affect the peroral susceptibility of adult females. Seasonal and yearly changes in the susceptibility of the Cx. tarsalis population to per os infection with SLE virus did not necessarily occur at the same time as those observed with WEE virus and did not appear to correlate with changes in ambient air temperature. Thus, extrinsic factors that affect the expression of viral susceptibility of Cx. tarsalis, and perhaps the genetic basis of viral susceptibility, apparently differ for WEE and SLE viruses.\r"

The authors found that the blood/gas partition coefficient of sevoflurane did not differ significantly among the three age groups. The partition coefficients of isoflurane and halothane in preterm neonates did not differ significantly from those in full-term neonates. However, the partition coefficients of both anesthetics in neonates were significantly less than those in adults. The blood/gas partition coefficients of the three volatile anesthetics in preterm neonates did not change significantly with gestational age. The blood/gas partition coefficients of sevoflurane, isoflurane and halothane for all three age groups combined correlated only with the serum concentration of cholesterol. The authors conclude that the blood/gas partition coefficients of isoflurane, halothane, and sevoflurane in preterm neonates are similar to those in full term neonates and that gestational age does not significantly affect the blood/gas solubility.\r"

Reversal time (time from administration of neostigmine at different PTC levels to a TOF ratio of 0.7) was found to depend upon the degree of blockade at the time of reversal. Median reversal time from a PTC of 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, and greater than 13 (but less than 10% twitch height) to a TOF ratio of 0.7 was 31, 23, 19, 18, 14, and 13 min, respectively. Spontaneous recovery from PTC level of 1-2, when atracurium infusion was stopped, to a PTC level at which antagonism was induced and reversal time were both correlated to the square root of the PTC. Total recovery time (spontaneous recovery plus reversal time) was not shortened by an early injection of neostigmine. It is concluded that neostigmine administration during intense neuromuscular blockade following atracurium infusion does not shorten total recovery time and offers no clinical advantages.\r"

  ".W": "This study aimed to determine whether: 1) the method of cooling the hand (i.e. central [total body] vs. local surface [hand only]) influences the relationship between the adductor pollicis temperature and twitch tension; and 2) decreased evoked twitch response during hypothermia is due to reduced muscle temperature and/or the anesthetic drug used. First, the effect of local surface cooling on adductor pollicis twitch tension during isoflurane anesthesia was determined in 15 patients, while central body temperature was not allowed to decrease. Adductor pollicis temperature and twitch tension decreased in a linear manner (P less than 0.05). However, the magnitude of the decreased response was only 43% of that observed during central cooling in the authors' previous study under otherwise similar experimental conditions. Second, the effect of central cooling on adductor pollicis twitch tension during nitrous oxide/fentanyl anesthesia was determined in five patients. The twitch tension did not decrease until the adductor pollicis temperature decreased below 35.2 degrees C. Below this temperature, twitch tension decreased 16%/degrees C reduction in muscle temperature. These results are similar to those obtained in the authors' previous study in patients anesthetized with nitrous oxide/isoflurane anesthesia. The authors conclude that both central and local surface cooling of the adductor pollicis muscle reduces twitch tension and that the decrease in adductor pollicis twitch tension is the same during nitrous oxide/isoflurane and nitrous oxide/fentanyl anesthesia.\r"

The authors studied whether the doses of fentanyl or methylprednisolone, or rates of dextrose infusion from blood products during CPB or from vasoactive infusions in 5% dextrose in water, were correlated with the blood glucose concentrations at the termination of CPB. Because other investigations have indicated that even moderate hyperglycemia during cerebral hypoxia or ischemia may predispose patients to an increased risk of neurologic deficit, the authors wished to determine whether any of these factors might contribute significantly to the elevation in blood glucose commonly seen in these patients. Multiple regression analysis and ANOVA were performed on these data, and a P value of 0.0125 was considered significant. The dose of methylprednisolone, and rates of infusions of dextrose from blood products in the CPB pump prime or from 5% dextrose in water at the termination of CPB did not correlated significantly with the blood glucose level. The dose of fentanyl administered to patients prior to the end of CPB was significantly correlated with the glucose concentration (r2 = 0.416; P = 0.0001).

An epidural catheter was inserted into ten healthy, nonpregnant volunteers randomly assigned to skin-surface warming below the T10 dermatome (warmed group) or no extra warming (unwarmed group). Each volunteer was given two 30-ml epidural injections of 1% lidocaine (16.0 +/- 4.7 degrees C and 40.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C at the catheter tip), in random order separated by at least 3 h. Skin-temperature gradients (forearm-fingertip) and tympanic membrane and average skin temperatures were recorded; significant vasoconstriction was prospectively defined as a gradient greater than or equal to 4 degrees C. Integrated electromyographic (EMG) intensity was recorded from four upper-body muscles. Overall thermal comfort was evaluated using a visual analog scale. Tympanic membrane temperatures decreased significantly in the unwarmed group (n = 6). Tremor occurred following ten of 12 injections in unwarmed volunteers, but only following one of eight injections in the warmed group. Integrated EMG intensity did not differ significantly following epidural injection of warm and cold lidocaine: tremor started when tympanic membrane temperature decreased about 0.5 degrees C and continued until central temperature returned to within 0.5 degrees C of control. Tremor always was preceded by hypothermia and vasoconstriction in the arms. Thermal comfort increased in both groups after epidural injection, with maximal comfort occurring at the lowest tympanic temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The thermoregulatory threshold was prospectively defined as the central temperature at which vasoconstriction occurred, and significant vasoconstriction was defined as a skin-surface temperature gradient (forearm-fingertip) greater than or equal to 4 degrees C. The threshold for thermoregulatory vasoconstriction and the intensity of vasoconstriction, measured as maximum skin-temperature gradient, was determined in six unpremedicated patients electively donating a kidney during isoflurane anesthesia, and in four healthy, awake volunteers. All anesthetized patients were deliberately cooled and became hypothermic. Vasoconstriction occurred in five of six at central temperatures between 35.3 and 32.4 degrees C, at end-tidal isoflurane concentrations between 0.74 and 1.65%. The patient who did not vasoconstrict received the highest isoflurane concentration (approximately 2.5%) and reached a central temperature of 31 degrees C. Unanesthetized volunteers also were exposed to cold and each vasoconstricted at a temperature near 37 degrees C. The threshold for thermoregulatory cutaneous vasoconstriction was inversely correlated with anesthetic dose, the thermoregulatory threshold decreasing approximately 3 degrees C/% isoflurane concentration. There were no statistically significant differences between maximum skin-surface temperature gradients in awake volunteers and patients given isoflurane, or between any of the groups when patients from previous studies given halothane or nitrous oxide/fentanyl anesthesia were included in the comparison. These data indicate that the intensity of vasoconstriction, once triggered, is similar during several different types of anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Death or brain damage occurred in 85% of cases. The median cost of settlement or jury award was +200,000. Most outcomes (72%) were considered preventable with better monitoring. Three mechanisms of injury accounted for three-fourths of the adverse respiratory events: inadequate ventilation (196; 38%), esophageal intubation (94; 18%), and difficult tracheal intubation (87; 17%). Inadequate ventilation was used to describe claims in which it was evident that insufficient gas exchange had produced the adverse outcome, but it was not possible to identify the exact cause. This group was characterized by the highest proportion of cases in which care was considered substandard (90%). The esophageal intubation group was notable for a recurring diagnostic failure: in 48% of cases where auscultation of breath sounds was performed and documented, this test led to the erroneous conclusion that the endotracheal tube was correctly located in the trachea. Claims for difficult tracheal intubation were distinguished by a comparatively small proportion of cases (36%) in which the outcome was considered preventable with better monitoring. A better understanding of respiratory risks may require investigative protocols that initiate data collection immediately upon the recognition of a critical incident or adverse outcome.\r"

Any patient with a positive history for the ingestion of medication known to interfere with platelet function was excluded from the study. Following induction of anesthesia with fentanyl (and prior to cardiopulmonary bypass) 28 patients (n = 28) received trimethaphan as clinically indicated to maintain a mean blood pressure of 80 mmHg. The infusion rate and total dose of trimethaphan delivered was recorded for each patient. The evaluation of platelet function was performed via adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation tests. The administration of trimethaphan failed to result in any detrimental effect on platelet function as assessed via these aggregation studies. Template bleeding times were also performed on all study patients. Bleeding time measurements performed in patients following trimethaphan administration were unchanged from baseline values. Platelet aggregation studies and bleeding time performed in control group following the administration of fentanyl (30 micrograms/kg) plus enflurane (inspired concentration 0.5-1%) did not reveal any deviation from baseline values. These results are in contrast to a previous study that demonstrated a negative effect upon platelet function following sodium nitroprusside administration (at clinically acceptable doses). These data demonstrate that trimethaphan provides control of arterial pressure with preservation of platelet function.\r"

There were no differences in MAC of halothane between SHR (n = 20) and WKY (n = 20) (1.08 +/- 0.02% vs. 1.11 +/- 0.02%).

In contrast the negative wave (N1) of segmental spinal cord potential, believed to be synchronized activity of dorsal horn neurons, was only minimally affected.

A 6-h infusion of both drugs was used in order to achieve steady-state. Blood and tissue concentrations of drugs were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. The partition coefficients of fentanyl were two- to 30-fold higher than those of alfentanil. These data were then used in a physiologic pharmacokinetic model describing the disposition of the two opioids in humans. The model predicted the plasma pharmacokinetics of these drugs in humans reasonably well. However, simulation beyond 24 h after a bolus administration showed a terminal half-life of 20 h for fentanyl, i.e., an elimination phase that has not yet been described in actual pharmacokinetic studies. In keeping with this, the volume of distribution of fentanyl in the model was also larger than expected. The simulated tissue concentration curves of fentanyl and alfentanil in humans could be used to explain the propensity of fentanyl to give secondary peaks in plasma concentration curves and the difference in effect kinetics between the two opioids. Physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling, based on measured data in small animals, can generate information that is not obtainable by empirical methods in humans.\r"

The calcium channel stimulator Bay k 8644 (0.5 and 1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was infused intravenously for 10 min and phenylephrine and azepexole administered at the end of each infusion. On different days, each dog was subsequently anesthetized with equihypotensive concentrations of halothane (1.7%) or isoflurane (2%) in oxygen and the same pharmacologic interventions were repeated in the presence of halothane or isoflurane. Twenty-one experiments (three groups) using seven chronically instrumented dogs were completed. Halothane and isoflurane produced significant (P less than 0.05) attenuation of the increase in arterial pressure after bolus administration of phenylephrine and azepexole. Bay k 8644 augmented the pressor responses mediated by both phenylephrine and azepexole in all three groups. Thus, halothane and isoflurane nonselectively reduced the pressor response to both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation and this was probably not mediated by inhibition of transmembrane calcium flux through dihydropyridine sensitive channels.\r"

Spontaneously ventilating rats (n = 28) were pretreated with dexmedetomidine, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg; dexmedetomidine, 30 micrograms/kg in combination with the central-acting alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan, 10 mg/kg; or vehicle. Fifteen minutes later all rats received alfentanil, 500 micrograms/kg. Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine reduced heart rate in a dose-related fashion. Administration of alfentanil also caused a significant reduction in heart rate. However, following alfentanil, the dexmedetomidine-treated animals did not have significantly greater bradycardia than control animals. An increase in blood pressure was observed in those animals receiving the larger dose of dexmedetomidine, but this difference disappeared following injection of alfentanil. The addition of idazoxan to the pretreatment regimen prevented the changes seen with dexmedetomidine. Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine produced no significant changes in arterial pH or PCO2. In all groups, administration of alfentanil resulted in a decrease in arterial pH that ultimately became a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The acidosis promptly resolved following injection of naloxone (1 mg/kg). It appears that dexmedetomidine, at the doses given, has little or no effect on respiration. Dexmedetomidine decreases heart rate but does not add to bradycardia following alfentanil. There is a hypertensive effect seen at the higher dose of dexmedetomidine, but this effect disappears when the drug is given in conjunction with alfentanil. These data show that addition of the alpha 2-agonist dexmedetomidine will not worsen the cardiovascular and respiratory depression associated with high-dose opiates in the spontaneously ventilating rat.\r"

  ".W": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is likely due to reentry involving the atrioventricular (AV) node, AV node with AV bypass pathway, sinus node, or atria. Intravenous diltiazem (DIL) or verapamil (VER) might be used to treat PSVT in anesthetized patients, and either drug could be more or less effective or produce adverse circulatory effects in this circumstance because the available inhalation anesthetics are known to elevate plasma concentrations of acutely administered iv DIL or VER. Because human studies were precluded and there are no reliable animal models for most reentrant PSVT, the authors determined the effects of iv DIL or VER and potent inhalation anesthetics (enflurane, halothane, isoflurane) on supraventricular electrophysiologic (EP) properties affecting the likelihood of reentrant PSVT in chronically instrumented dogs. Measurements of supraventricular EP properties in awake dogs without drugs served as control. DIL and VER were then administered iv to achieve clinically relevant plasma concentrations in awake dogs and EP properties were again measured. Finally, anesthetic effects on EP properties in dogs with DIL or VER were tested at end-tidal concentrations equivalent to 1.2 or 1.6 MAC for enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane. In awake dogs, DIL or VER increased AV node conduction time. Wenckebach point and functional refractoriness, and also reduced the range of premature atrial intervals for and likelihood of producing sinus node interpolation or reentry with atrial extrastimulation (P less than 0.05, ANOVA). AV node conduction time, Wenckebach point, and functional refractoriness were further increased in anesthetized dogs (all agents) with DIL or VER compared with control (P less than 0.05, ANOVA). All anesthetics with DIL or VER abolished sinus node interpolation and reentry. Atrial effective and functional refractory periods were not affected by DIL or VER in awake dogs and were increased by any of the anesthetics in dogs with DIL (P less than 0.05, ANOVA). Atrial refractory periods were little affected by anesthetics with VER. Adverse circulatory effects, including systolic arterial pressure less than 50 mmHg and second-degree (type 1) AV block or sinus arrest with escape rhythms, were most common with VER and any (especially enflurane) of the anesthetics. Finally, anesthetized animals with sinus arrest and escape rhythms (any test condition) could be paced from the atrium at physiologic rates (up to 120 beats/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The study evaluated the effects of different anesthetics on the hepatic oxygen supply-demand relationship and hepatic lactate uptake (HLu). Miniature pigs (n = 33), weighing 20-31 kg, were divided into five groups and accordingly anesthetized with halothane, isoflurane, enflurane (0.9%, 1.5%, and 2.2% end-expired concentrations, respectively), fentanyl (100 micrograms/kg iv bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 50 micrograms.kg-1.h-1), or sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg iv bolus followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 1-2 mg.kg-1.h-1). The surgical preparation allowed the authors to induce a stepwise decrease in hepatic blood supply without congestion in the preportal tissues. Prior to induced hepatic hypoperfusion, the values of hepatic oxygen delivery (HDO2) were the greatest in the isoflurane and fentanyl groups and the smallest in the halothane group, while the values of hepatic oxygen uptake (HVO2) were the smallest in the halothane group without differences among the other four groups. During stepwise decrease in hepatic blood and oxygen supply, HLu started to decrease at higher values of hepatic oxygen delivery in the fentanyl group (HDO2 = 10 mlO2.min-1.100 g-1) than in all others (HDO2 = 6-7 mlO2.min-1.100 g-1). At values of HDO2 equal to 2-3 mlO2.min-1.100 g-1, the values of HLu became negative, signifying that the liver began to release rather than to metabolize lactate. There was a linear relationship between the values of HDO2 and hepatic venous oxygen tension or saturation (r = 0.96; P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cell length of single, isolated rat and dog heart cells was monitored during exposure to halothane-containing solution to define the cellular mechanism of halothane's negative inotropic effect. Spontaneous contractile waves, which reflect spontaneous Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in resting rat heart cells, exhibited a significant increase in frequency and a decrease in amplitude in the presence of halothane 0.27 mM (0.9 vol%) and 0.55 mM (1.7 vol%). Electrically stimulated dog and rat heart cells abruptly exposed to halothane (0.47-0.55 mM or 1.5-1.7 vol%) revealed a transient increase in twitch amplitude (significantly different from control). Twitch amplitude then declined to values significantly below control as halothane exposure continued. This decrease in twitch reached 42 +/- 13% (mean +/- SD) of control in rat cells and 50 +/- 14% in dog cells beating at 60 beats per min. In dog cells the magnitude of the transient increase in twitch amplitude was greater at faster beating rates compared with lower rates in the same cells (P less than 0.01) and the transient increase was insensitive to verapamil. Halothane 0.55 mM (1.7 vol%) also significantly accelerated the rate of decline in the twitch amplitude of successive beats in rat cells stimulated after a rest interval (negative staircase). The findings regarding spontaneous contractile waves indicate a direct effect of halothane at the SR in resting cells, occurring independently of any changes in the slow inward current. The halothane-induced changes in beating cells can be explained by an enhancement of Ca release from the SR with an eventual reduction of SR Ca stores.\r"

Whole tracheas were excised, cannulated, and mounted in 50-ml tissue baths. The serosal and epithelial surfaces were perfused via separate circuits with Krebs-Henseleit solution. All data were expressed as a percent of constriction produced by 2 X 10(-6) M carbachol (a concentration that elicited a 90 + % of maximal constriction). Thiopental elicited a dose-dependent constriction in all 25 tracheas. Increases in tone were first seen at 10(-5) M (14.3 +/- 1.84%; mean +/- SEM) and reached a peak at 10(-3) M (29 +/- 3.16%; P less than .0001). Responses to thiopental were similar when the epithelium was removed, when thiopental was added to the inner perfusate, and when tracheas were pretreated with 10(-5) M pyrilamine. Constriction was entirely inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin 10(-5) M. The authors conclude that thiopental, at concentrations in the clinical range, causes a reproducible dose-dependent constriction of guinea pig trachea. This effect is mediated by constrictor prostaglandins.\r"

Furthermore, pregnancy, drug abuse, and malnutrition may have had a unique impact on her muscle physiology. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, in any patient who is recovering or has clinically recovered from a neurologic deficit, a normal neurologic examination does not ensure that succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia will not occur. Although these patients should eventually not be susceptible to succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia, current data do not support a specific recommendation of when succinylcholine would be safe.\r"

Pentoxifylline is known to increase whole blood filtration rate, and recent evidence suggests that pentoxifylline increases the filtration rate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The purpose of this study was to directly observe and quantitate the effect of pentoxifylline on the flow of individual PMNs into a model capillary. Short-term incubation of human PMNs with 10 mM pentoxifylline inhibited cell activation, as judged by a significant reduction in the number of neutrophils forming pseudopods. Furthermore, incubation of PMNs from 6 healthy men with 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mM pentoxifylline significantly decreased the time required for individual cells to be aspirated into a 4 microns pipet under constant pressure by 16 +/- 5%, 21 +/- 7%, and 41 +/- 8%, respectively (mean +/- SEM, p less than or equal to 0.05), compared with control. These experiments are the first direct demonstration of increased deformability in neutrophils treated with pentoxifylline. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of pentoxifylline on microvascular perfusion is partly due to an inhibition of PMN stiffness and activation.\r"

Clinical and scientific data were compared to evaluate the degree of similarity that exists between these two peripheral vascular diseases. Data indicate that certain pathologic and pharmacologic aspects seem to have common features. Some of the correlations maybe due simply to both diseases having ischemia of the distal digits as a pathologic component. The exact etiology of the ischemia is not known for either disease. The results of this study suggest the hypothesis that RP and laminitis are the same disease in different species. This hypothesis can be tested more efficiently when the pathophysiology of both conditions is better documented. It is possible that comparative studies will promote advances in the understanding of both RP and laminitis. The fact that equine laminitis can be experimentally induced is of potential value in such future studies.\r"

Pressure gradients across each of the stenoses were measured while both the severity and the separation of the stenoses were altered. The individual resistances were compared with the combined resistance. Resistance at a stenosis is a nonlinear function of the severity of the stenosis. The resistance is a complex function of the perfusion pressure and the cross-sectional area of the stenosis and cannot be accurately predicted from a single plane angiographic image. With multiple stenoses an approximate assessment of the combined effect can be obtained by summing the value of the resistance for each stenosis but not the degree of the stenoses. The nonlinear relationship of resistance to stenosis severity means that if one stenosis is more severe than the other, the combined effect can be regarded as the same as the effect of the more severe stenosis acting by itself. The distance between the stenoses does not change their combined effect.\r"

At follow-up twelve to forty-six months following catheterization, 89% with left ventricular dysfunction and 82% with normal ventricular function had continued to experience chest pain. There was no significant change in the admission rate to hospital because of chest pain or the proportion of patients who were working, after catheterization as compared with before, in either group. Some patients with left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities appeared to have progressive left ventricular dysfunction. In a prospective study of 63 patients, detailed investigation of esophageal function was performed. Twenty-two patients had left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. The majority of the 41 patients with normal left ventricular wall motion had esophageal abnormalities that were treated appropriately. At follow-up six to twenty-four months following catheterization significantly fewer patients with normal left ventricular function continued to experience chest pain compared with those with left ventricular dysfunction. Following catheterization the hospital admission rate fell significantly and the proportion of patients working increased significantly in the group with normal left ventricular function. The hospital admission rate and employment status of patients with left ventricular dysfunction did not change significantly following angiography. These findings suggest, therefore, that investigation for and treatment of esophageal dysfunction should be performed in patients with angina pectoris, normal coronary angiograms, and normal left ventricular function.\r"

Comparison of color-flow and 3D images demonstrated that wall configuration in vivo, dilation, and curvature play an important role in reversal of flow and stagnation at the carotid bifurcation. Furthermore, 3D analysis is very useful in mapping the distribution of the atheromatous plaques. The analyses suggest that it is important to investigate the wall configuration of the bifurcation in vivo on flow patterns, especially flow separation and stagnation, in relation to the development of atheromatous plaques.\r"

Furthermore, it is still unknown how leukotrienes take part in this process. Twelve mongrel dogs were used, divided into two groups. In group A, left thoracotomy and hilar stripping of the left lung was performed under anesthesia. During warm ischemia (two hours) and reperfusion (two hours), a filter was used three times between the femoral artery and vein, and quantitative in vivo blood filtration was performed. In group B, warm ischemia and reperfusion was done in the same fashion without filtration. As for tissue free radical assay, lipid peroxidation products were measured by means of thiobarbituric acid. Tissue leukotriene B4 and C4 levels were measured by radio immunoassay. In addition, peripheral blood count and tissue wet/dry ratio were analyzed. Significant leukocyte depletion of peripheral blood with leukocyte efflux from reperfused lung was observed in group A. Significant increase of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) titers after reperfusion was observed in group B, whereas no significant fluctuation of tissue MDA titers was noted in group A. Concerning leukotriene B4 and C4, no significant increase was observed in either group. Tissue damage estimated by lung wet/dry ratio was considered to be controlled in group A compared with group B. Thus, the authors conclude that in vivo use of a leukocyte filter is efficient in removal of peripheral blood leukocytes and in preservation of reperfused lung after warm ischemia and that oxygen metabolites of leukocytes are considered to play a role in tissue damage in this process.\r"

To compare the relative contribution of smoking with other predictors of the presence of roentgenographic small opacities, we examined 661 men enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial designed to assess the efficacy of vitamin A and beta-carotene in the prevention of lung cancer among workers with heavy occupational asbestos exposure. Subjects in the study population had a mean latency of 35 yr from first asbestos exposure and a mean of 28 yr in their trade. The prevalence of roentgenographic abnormalities consistent with asbestos exposure was 26% for pleural abnormalities alone, 10% for parenchymal abnormalities alone, and 20% for pleural and parenchymal abnormalities together. We investigated occupation, age, latency from first asbestos exposure, and smoking status as predictors of roentgenographic small opacities. Smoking history, independent of latency, contributed to the prevalence and extent of small opacities, but its effect was less than that of latency. We conclude, that in the setting of heavy occupational exposure to asbestos, cigarette smoking confers added risk for the development of roentgenographic small opacities.\r"

Mucus was collected from patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy without atropine by holding a cytology brush in contact with the tracheal mucosa for 10 to 15 s. Samples were obtained from 43 patients 24 to 79 yr of age: nine nonsmokers, 18 current smokers, and 16 exsmokers (greater than 6 months); 12 patients (nine smokers, three exsmokers) had lung cancer. Pulmonary function testing showed that the nonsmoker patients had significant restrictive lung disease, and the patients with cancer had significant irreversible airway obstruction. The viscoelastic properties of the mucus samples were determined by magnetic microrheometry. Two parameters are reported: G* (modulus of rigidity) and tan delta (loss tangent), each measured at 1 and 100 rad/s. G* is an index of overall deformability (elastic and viscous), and tan delta is the ratio of viscous to elastic deformability. For nonsmoker patients, the viscoelastic parameters were virtually identical to those found previously for normal volunteers. For smokers without cancer, the mucus had a lower value of tan delta 1 rad/s and therefore was predicted to be more easily transportable by ciliary action; for exsmokers without cancer, ciliary transportability as calculated from viscoelasticity was even higher because of both low tan delta and low G*. Mucus from patients with cancer was not significantly different from that of nonsmokers; however, the mucus was predicted to be less easily clearable by ciliary action than was that from smokers and exsmokers without cancer, mainly because of a higher tan delta at 1 rad/s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During a 16-yr period, we diagnosed and treated 63 patients with SVCS, including seven (11%) children younger than 10 yr of age. Thirty patients (47.6%) had bronchogenic carcinoma, and 13 (20.6%) had lymphoma. In 43 cases SVCS was the presenting symptom of a mediastinal condition. Forty-one patients underwent diagnostic procedures with no major complications, and diagnosis was obtained in 36. Only six patients had surgical treatment, and 45 had radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both. There was no mortality associated directly with venous congestion. Symptomatic relief occurred in 80% of treated patients. We conclude that: (1) SVCS per se should not be feared (symptomatic relief is the rule), (2) accurate diagnosis can be achieved with minimal morbidity, and (3) the versatile underlying etiology dictates the outcome that can be improved with appropriate therapy.\r"

Using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by personal samplers as a measure of air pollution, the study aimed to identify the major sources of NO2 in the indoor environment and see whether its increased presence was associated with respiratory symptoms. The levels of NO2 among the mothers was found to increase by 21% if dust exposure was reported from the workplace, 18% if they used such cooking fuels as liquid petroleum gas or kerosene, 11% when kitchens did not have ventilating fans, and 10% when incense was burned at home. In terms of respiratory symptoms, an increase in NO2 levels of 19% was reported among those with allergic rhinitis and 18% among those with chronic cough. The levels of NO2 among children were correlated with levels measured in classrooms, all of which had opened windows so that the NO2 came from outdoors. No association was found between children's NO2 levels and respiratory symptoms. With the exception of smoking by the father and the children's NO2 levels, no association was found between smoking at home and NO2 levels.\r"

After tests were grouped into four strata based on postconception (PC) age, variability and sex differences in level of PF were examined. No significant sex differences were found for any PF measure in any age stratum, even when somatic size was controlled by length correction. Force expiratory flow measures, however, tended to be greater in girls than in boys in the youngest infants. Flow measures demonstrated greater between-subject variability than did volumes, and variability was greatest in the youngest infants. Within-subject variability also was more pronounced for flow measures, particularly in infants younger than 50 PC wk of age. Across the age range of infants studied, all PF measures were related linearly to somatic size as measured by either length, weight, or chest circumference. Length offered the best individual size correction of the three size parameters studied. Linear regression of PF parameters versus length demonstrated FRC to increase at 5.39 ml/cm over this age range, whereas flow at FRC increased by 9.67 ml/s/cm. We conclude that the variability of infant PF measures is greatest in early infancy, that measures of forced expiratory flow are more variable than volume measures, and that sex differences in infant PF do not appear significant. Length is related linearly to PF measures and offers reasonable size correction for healthy infants younger than 18 months of age.\r"

  ".U": "90253061\r", 
  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine if the ventilatory capacity of children is affected by hourly concentrations of ozone inhaled during their daily activity. Over a 3-wk period (June-July 1987) children who were attending a summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains of California performed spirometry up to three times per day during their stay at the camp. A total of 43 children were tested a total of 461 times. Ozone, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity were measured continuously. Daily average measurements of total suspended particulate and the PM10 particulate fraction (less than or equal to 10 microns) were also made. Hourly ozone concentrations at the time of testing varied between 20 and 245 ppb. Regressions of each individual's FEV1 and FVC supported the view that high ozone levels reduced these lung function parameters. The average regression coefficient for FEV1 on ozone was -0.39 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.12) and for FVC -0.44 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.15), both of which were significantly different from zero. Statistical allowance for temperature and humidity increased the magnitude of these slopes. Nitrogen dioxide never exceeded 40 ppb during the time of testing and averaged 13 ppb. Sulfur dioxide's highest measurement was 8 ppb and often was at the limit of detection. Neither NO2 nor SO2 was considered in the statistical modeling. Data were divided based on whether each subject had been exposed to levels of ozone in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the several hours previous to being tested. Exposures exceeding the NAAQS indicated a significant negative relationship between ozone and FEV1, FVC, and PEFR. Data for nonexceedance periods did not indicate this negative relationship for any of the three lung function parameters, but it could not be determined if this was due to an absence of an ozone effect or to a combination of the increased variability and decreased size of this data subset. These data indicate that lung function changes on a daily basis relate in a negative fashion to ambient ozone levels. The magnitude of the changes are small and are reversed as ambient ozone decreases.\r"

The median frequency of the power spectrum of the breath sounds was found to correlate with the percentage change in FEV1 induced by histamine and with FEF50. The analysis suggests that for a decrease in FEV1 of 20%, the median frequency of breath sound would increase by 80 Hz. Variation in airway caliber produced a consistent alteration in the distribution of energy in inspiratory breath sound in the absence of wheeze. Spectral analysis of breath sound may be a useful addition to conventional spirometry in identifying changes in airway diameter.\r"

  ".W": "Using 30 anesthetized cats, we examined whether oxygen radicals produce airway constriction or hyperresponsiveness. In one group, we administered aerosolized xanthine (0.1%) for 3 min followed by aerosolized xanthine oxidase (XO) (1 U/ml) for 5 min in order to generate oxygen radicals enzymatically in the airways. Pulmonary resistance (RL) instantaneously increased from 14.8 +/- 0.9 to 30.8 +/- 1.4 cm H2O/L/s (p less than 0.01). The increase in RL was significantly depressed by prior administration of polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) or polyethylene glycolcatalase (PEG-CAT). In a second group, in order to examine changes in airway responsiveness, we studied acetylcholine (ACh) challenge before and 30, 60, and 120 min after inhalations of xanthine and XO. After xanthine-XO, the airways were hyperresponsive to ACh at 30 and at 60 min (p less than 0.05) but not at 120 min. The geometric means of ACh provocative concentrations that caused an increase in RL of 10 cm H2O/L/s above the baseline value before and 30, 60, and 120 min after xanthine-XO were 0.25, 0.045, 0.073, and 0.15%, respectively. The increase in responsiveness to ACh was significantly correlated with the increase in RL after xanthine-XO inhalation (r = 0.88, p less than 0.05). These data support the concept that oxygen radicals generated by xanthine-XO inhalation may induce bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

The radioactivity increased rapidly (within 10 s) in tracheobronchial as well as in lung tissue, confirming that the large airway microcirculation was well supplied also by the perfusion. The effluent concentrations of total 3H and 14C radioactivity at the onset, during, and after intrapulmonary infusion of 14C-labeled xanthines and 3H-sucrose were closely associated, suggesting that the xanthines, like sucrose, largely distributed in extracellular fluid and were not taken up by the tissues. No metabolites of enprofylline or theophylline could be detected in the lung tissue or lung effluent, suggesting that xanthines are not biotransformed by the guinea pig lung. After intratracheal instillation of 14C-theophylline, the peak radioactivity in the lung effluent appeared in the second 15-s fraction after instillation, and after 10 and 60 min, 68.1 +/- 4.7% and 86.9 +/- 8.4%, respectively, of the given dose had appeared in the lung effluent. The present data suggest a mainly extracellular distribution and a rapid clearance of xanthines from the lung and airway tissues. The rapid disappearance of topical theophylline may explain the lack of success of inhalation therapy with this drug.\r"

Increased right ventricular weight was related to decreased bronchiolar diameter, decreased ratio of bronchiolar diameter to external arterial diameter, and an increased proportion of airways less than 400 microns in diameter. No relationship was found between the severity of emphysema, mucous gland enlargement, peripheral airway mucous plugging, or other measurement of central and peripheral airways. Patients with right ventricles weighing more than 100 g had higher pulmonary artery pressures at rest and higher arterial CO2 levels than those weighing 100 g or less. When the patients were divided into Types A, B, and X according to Burrows' criteria, those with Type X had a higher volume proportion of mucous glands; type B were intermediate; and Type A had the smallest. The amount of bronchial muscle was less in Type B patients than in Type A, and right ventricles weighted less in Type A patients than in Type B. Hypoxic ventilatory drive was lower in Type B patients than in Type A. Absolute right ventricular weight appeared to be a better measurement of right ventricular enlargement than relative right ventricular weight in the NIH NOTT patients. We conclude that right ventricular weight in patients with hypoxic chronic airflow obstruction (CAO) is related to airway narrowing, and that the Type B syndrome is associated with decreased ventilatory drive.\r"

HCl infusion decreased arterial pH from 7.55 to 7.40 (p less than 0.001) and increased PaO2 from 76 to 98 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at the end of the study. Cardiac output and oxygen consumption did not change. In patients with initial venous admixture (QS/QT) less than 20% (n = 4), QS/QT did not change, and hemoglobin saturation decreased, whereas PaO2 increased from 87 to 96 mm Hg (p less than 0.10), indicating a shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve caused by the Bohr effect. In patients with QS/QT greater than 20% (n = 4), QS/QT decreased from 27 to 22% (p less than 0.05), hemoglobin saturation increased from 93 to 96% (p less than 0.05), and PaO2 increased from 65 to 100 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), which reflects an improvement in ventilation/perfusion relationships, probably because of enhanced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. These data indicate that metabolic alkalosis deteriorates pulmonary ventilation/perfusion relationships in patients with marked respiratory failure (QS/QT greater than 20%), and that reversing this effect with HCl infusion can improve PaO2 significantly.\r"

In the majority of cases, there is no obvious cause of dyspnea, but as skeletal myopathy is also common in thyrotoxic patients, it has been postulated that increased dyspnea could be secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. We sought to determine whether thyrotoxic patients were in fact more dyspneic on exertion than age- and sex-matched controls, and if so, whether the increased dyspnea was secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. The study group consisted of 12 thyrotoxic patients and 12 control subjects matched for age and gender. We measured lung volumes, compliance, elastic recoil, respiratory muscle strength, maximal exercise performance, and the intensity of breathlessness (modified Borg scale) at various levels of exercise in all subjects. The respiratory muscles were weaker in patients than controls. This weakness improved in treated patients (p less than 0.05) with concomitant increases in VC, IC, and TLC (all p less than 0.05). Despite this, we found no differences in breathlessness intensity scores between patients and controls or in patients before and after successful antithyroid therapy.\r"

To confirm this subjective impression by objective measurements, we studied a group of 123 patients referred to us because of snoring and suspected OSA, all of whom had nocturnal polysomnography and measurements of external and internal neck circumference. The external neck circumference was measured at the level of the superior border of the cricothyroid cartilage. Internal neck circumferences were calculated from the measurements of pharyngeal, glottic, and tracheal areas obtained by the acoustic reflection technique. Internal pharyngeal circumference was further subdivided into the proximal, middle, and distal thirds. The acoustic technique also permitted us to measure the distance between the teeth and the glottic minimum, which reflects the length of the upper airway. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) correlated only with the external neck circumference, the body mass index, and the internal circumference of the distal pharynx; these three variables accounted for 39% of the variability in AHI. We conclude that the external and internal neck circumferences and the degree of obesity are important predictors of sleep apnea; it is possible that obesity produces its effect via fat in the neck. We speculate that the static pharyngeal size modulated by the dynamic loading of the airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA.\r"

Thus, each case of tuberculosis that occurs may be viewed as a \"failure\" of the prevention system. We studied the reasons for these \"failures\" at three centers in different geographic areas in the United States. Two hundred seventy-nine patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. Our results suggest three main reasons for these missed opportunities of tuberculosis prevention. (1) Patients are out of the health care system until they develop tuberculosis. (2) Patients are in the system but are either not screened for tuberculous infection or, if screened, are not offered preventive therapy when it is appropriate. (3) Because of false negative skin test results, screening may be ineffective at the time it is applied. Advances in tuberculosis prevention will require attention to these areas.\r"

A recent report suggests that ethanol consumption may have a protective role against this disease in smokers. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ethanol consumption on neutrophil elastase activity and superoxide production of peripheral blood neutrophils. These activities were measured in neutrophils from 52 male intoxicated patients and compared to activities in neutrophils from 20 male volunteers. Neutrophils from intoxicated patients contained 31% less elastase activity than that found in controls, 0.99 +/- 0.27 versus 1.44 +/- 0.23 micrograms/10(6) neutrophils (p less than 0.0001) and produced 25 to 27% less superoxide than controls in response to phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, 0.90 +/- 0.17 versus 1.2 +/- 0.21 nmol/min/10(6) PMN (p less than 0.0001) or N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, 0.64 +/- 0.19 versus 0.88 +/- 0.24 (p less than 0.001). In follow-up studies of 10 patients admitted for acute alcoholism, elastase activity and superoxide production remained low for 2 to 4 days. After 6 to 10 days, elastase activity and superoxide production were significantly greater than they were at Day 0 and approached normal levels. Neutrophils isolated from blood samples of healthy abstaining donors, which had been exposed to ethanol or to plasma from inebriated patients for 16 to 20 h, showed no loss of elastase activity or superoxide production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate tumoricidal responses of alveolar macrophages in renal carcinoma to determine if such activity is compromised. Alveolar macrophages and/or blood monocytes were obtained from 26 normal volunteers and 16 patients with renal carcinoma. Tumoricidal activity of alveolar macrophages and monocytes was assessed against 3H-thymidine-labeled tumor target cells. Patient alveolar macrophages and monocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or recombinant interferon-gamma expressed tumoricidal activity comparable to those in normal subjects. Activated alveolar macrophages recognized and lysed neoplastic cells (including allogenic renal carcinoma cells), but not nonneoplastic cells. Alveolar macrophage and monocyte tumoricidal responses of patients with pulmonary metastases were not different from those of patients with metastases to other sites. These results indicate that alveolar macrophages from patients with renal carcinoma with or without pulmonary metastases are not compromised in vitro, but respond to immunomodulators with enhanced tumoricidal activity in the same fashion as do alveolar macrophages from normal volunteers.\r"

Guinea pigs were actively sensitized by two subcutaneous injections of 10 micrograms ovalbumin in 1 mg AI(OH)3 at 2-wk intervals. One week after the second (booster) injection, the lungs were removed, perfused in the absence or presence of indomethacin, and challenged at 10-min intervals with PAF-acether (1 and 100 ng) and with ovalbumin (1 micrograms). No inhibition of PAF-acether- and antigen-induced BC or mediator release from sensitized lungs was observed when nedocromil sodium (10 microM) was added directly to the buffer solution. By contrast, when guinea pigs were treated for 1 wk before the experiment with nedocromil sodium (30 mg/kg per day), BC and the release of leukotrienelike material (but not of thromboxane B2) to 1 ng PAF-acether were reduced by around 50% (p less than 0.05) and 62% (p less than 0.05), respectively. No inhibition was observed for 100 ng PAF-acether and 1 micrograms ovalbumin. Furthermore, nedocromil sodium markedly impaired histamine secretion induced by both PAF-acether and antigen administration. Nedocromil sodium did not affect the titers of circulating ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin G, as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 1-wk treatment with nedocromil sodium also reduced markedly the proportion of eosinophils in the BAL of sensitized guinea pigs, whereas it was ineffective when injected once subcutaneously at the dose of 30 mg/kg 2 h before the experiment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if lung injury, inflammation, and asbestosis could be inhibited in vivo in a rapid-onset, inhalation model of disease, a novel method of chronic administration of antioxidant enzymes was developed. In brief, Fischer 344 rats were treated with polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEG-) superoxide dismutase or catalase in osmotic pumps over a 10-day (5 days/wk for 2 wk) or 20-day (5 days/wk for 2 wk) period of exposure to crocidolite asbestos. Control rats included sham-exposed animals and those exposed to asbestos but receiving chemically inactivated enzymes. After 10 days of exposure to asbestos, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were measured in one group of rats. Total and differnetial cell counts in BAL also were assessed. After 20 days of exposure, lungs of an additional group of rats were evaluated by histopathology and by measurement of hydroxyproline. Asbestos-associated elevations in LDH, protein, and total cell numbers in BAL were reduced in rats receiving PEG-catalase. Decreases in numbers of alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and lymphocytes occurred in these animals. Exposure to asbestos for 20 days caused significant increases in both the amount of hydroxyproline in lung and the severity and extent of fibrotic lesions as determined by histopathology. These indicators of asbestosis were inhibited in a dosage-dependent fashion in rats receiving PEG-catalase. Use of inactivated PEG-catalase failed to boost serum levels of catalase and did not inhibit asbestos-induced elevation of hydroxyproline in lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The migratory and phagocytic capabilities of pulmonary macrophages are important elements in lung defense against particles and pathogens deposited on alveolar surfaces. Both functions rely on macrophage cytoplasmic movements. We examined how a common respiratory exposure, cigarette smoking, affects intracellular motions in human pulmonary macrophages (HPM phi). We observed that HPM phi isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage from human volunteers and cultured in vitro were capable of ingesting unopsonized magnetic iron oxide particles localized within phagosomes and phagolysosomes. Upon magnetization, the particles collectively produced a remanent magnetic field (RMF). Motions of particle-containing organelles caused a decay of the RMF, or \"relaxation.\" We applied this technique, which is an alternative to optical microscopy, for evaluating both movement and viscosity of macrophage cytoplasm. In our in vitro studies, we found that HPM phi isolated from smokers exhibited more rapid RMF decay than did HPM phi isolated from nonsmokers. Rotating the intracellular magnetic particles with external fields showed that the HPM phi cytosol was highly viscous in both smoker and nonsmoker cells. In both cell groups, resistance to particle rotation was increased by 2.6 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate. Our in vitro magnetometric quantification of intracellular particle movement in isolated HPM phi suggests that lung macrophage cell organelle motions are increased in smokers; this may be the mechanism for the enhanced in vivo magnetic-particle motion reported previously in magnetometric studies of human subjects who are smokers.\r"

On microscopic observation, isolated cells were mainly composed of secretory glandular cells. Maximal HTG cell growth was observed when cells were cultured on type I collagen in the presence of 2% Ultroser G. Under these conditions, 3 to 6 HTG cell passages, corresponding to 20 to 30 population doublings, could be achieved. Lysozyme and bronchial inhibitor (Brl), two secretory protein markers specific to the serous HTG cells, were released in the culture medium, maximal secretion being observed 7 days after the cells had reached confluency. At that time, Brl could be detected, with an immunoperoxidase technique, in about 90% of the cells in culture, suggesting that most cells in culture were serous cells. Using transmission electron microscopy, after in situ fixation, HTG cells exhibited an epithelioid appearance at confluency. Using the biotin-streptavidin gold technique, we identified Brl in cytoplasmic vesicles and in small, immature electron-dense secretory granules. In high cell density cultures, we observed dome formation, suggesting active ion transport mechanisms in HTG cell culture. At confluency, a dose-dependent increase of Brl secretion was induced by phenylephrine, isoproterenol, and carbochol. These results suggest that HTG cell culture provides a useful tool to study the biochemistry and regulation of human tracheobronchial gland cell secretion.\r"

This pulmonary eosinophilia was not accompanied by blood eosinophilia. The oral administration of cyclosporin, 50 mg/kg body weight, every other day significantly suppressed the pulmonary eosinophilia. Athymic C57BL/6-nu/nu mice failed to develop pulmonary eosinophilia. These data indicate that pulmonary eosinophilia caused by this parasite extract is T-cell-dependent. Genetically mast-cell-deficient (WB X C57BL/6)F1-W/WV (W/WV) mice developed marked eosinophilia in the BAL, which shows that mast cells are not necessary in the formation of eosinophilia in BAL in this model. C57BL/6, W/WV, and Balb-C mice that developed eosinophilia in the BAL also showed elevated total IgE levels and IgE titers against Asc in the sera. On the other hand, C57BL/6-nu/nu mice and IgE low-responder SJL mice, which developed little eosinophilia, did not show elevated total IgE levels and IgE titers against Asc in the sera. However, oral administration of cyclosporin, 50 mg/kg, which inhibited eosinophilia in the BAL in C57BL/6 mice, did not significantly inhibit the elevation of total IgE or IgE against Asc in the sera. This indicates that serum IgE production is not required for the formation of eosinophilia.\r"

Influenza virus pneumonitis causes severe acute lung damage that, upon resolution, is followed by a persistent alveolitis and parenchymal changes characterized by patchy interstitial pneumonia and collagen deposition in the affected areas. To determine whether oxidant exposure exacerbates the virus-induced alveolitis and residual lung damage, mice were infected by aerosol inhalation with influenza A virus and continuously exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone or ambient air. Noninfected control mice were exposed to either ambient air or ozone. On various days during the first month after infection, groups of mice were sacrificed and their lungs assessed for acute injury (lung lavage albumin, total and differential cell counts, wet/dry ratios, and morphometry). At 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after infection, groups of mice were sacrificed for total and differential lavage cell counts, lung hydroxyproline content, and morphometric analysis. Ozone exposure did not alter the proliferation of virus in the lungs as quantitated by infectious virus titers of lung homogenates at 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15 days after virus infection but mitigated the virus-induced acute lung injury by approximately 50%. After Day 30 a shift in the character of the pulmonary lesions was observed in that continuous exposure to ozone potentiated the postinfluenzal alveolitis and structural changes in the lung parenchyma. Additional studies suggest that the mechanism for the enhanced postinfluenzal lung damage may be related to the oxidant impairing the repair process of the acute influenzal lung damage. These data demonstrate that ozone exposure mitigates acute virus-induced lung injury and potentiates residual lung damage.\r"

COPD patients had significantly higher serum IgG and IgA antibody titers than 13 healthy controls (mean IgG titers 12,302 and 5,623, respectively; mean IgA titers, 2,398 and 912; p less than 0.001). The mean IgM titers were comparable: 501 and 447, respectively. Specific IgA antibodies were also detectable in the sputum of the COPD patients (mean IgA antibody titer, 776). The local antibody production was determined by calculating the relative coefficient of excretion (RCE) to albumin. The mean RCE of 89.1 for IgA indicated statistically significant local production (p less than 0.02), in contrast to a nonsignificant increase for IgG (mean RCE of 3.6). Specific IgM was below the detection level. Immunoblotting experiments showed that the antibodies in sera from COPD patients and controls were directed against most of the outer membrane proteins of H. influenzae, with individual differences between IgG, IgA, and IgM. The IgA and IgG antibodies in serum had a similar specificity as those in sputum. The appearance or persistence of H. influenzae coincided with minor changes in antibody titer and specificity. From these results we conclude that COPD patients are infected with H. influenzae despite the presence of at least as many antibodies in sputum and serum as in controls and that these antibodies are directed against a variety of antigenic determinants of the infecting strain.\r"

Rats were exposed 7 h/day, 5 days/wk for 24 months to diesel exhaust at 3.5 mg soot/m3, or to clean air as controls. Emphysema was induced in one-half of the rats by intratracheal instillation of elastase 6 wk before exhaust exposure. Measurements included lung burdens of diesel soot, respiratory function, bronchoalveolar lavage, clearance of radiolabeled particles, pulmonary immune responses, lung collagen, excised lung weight and volume, histopathology, and mean linear intercept of terminal air spaces. Parameters indicated by analysis of variance to exhibit significant interactions between the influences of emphysema and exhaust were examined to determine if the effects were more than additive (indicating increased susceptibility). Although 14 of 63 parameters demonstrated emphysema-exhaust interactions, none indicated increased susceptibility. Less soot accumulated in lungs of emphysematous rats than in those of nonemphysematous rats, and the reduced accumulation had a sparing effect in the emphysematous rats. The results did not support the hypothesis that emphysematous lungs are more susceptible than are normal lungs to chronic exposure to high levels of diesel exhaust. The superimposition of effects of emphysema and exhaust, however, might still warrant special concern for heavy exposures of emphysematous subjects.\r"

This allowed in vivo characterization of the human diaphragm's force-length relationship. As PD volume increased from zero to 3 L, FRC decreased from 2.41 +/- 0.29 L to 1.93 +/- 0.072 L; mean total diaphragm length index (TDLI) increased from 0.22 +/- 0.01 to 0.28 +/- 0.01, and diaphragm radius of curvature remained unchanged. Respiratory muscle strength increased as a function of dialysate volume, reaching its maximum after the infusion of 3 L PD. In contrast, normal subjects achieved maximal inspiratory muscle force at their normal FRC, with a mean TDLI of 0.26 +/- 0.01 and showed no further increase as the diaphragm lengthened. We conclude that the human diaphragm may be capable of an adaptive rightward shift in its force-length relationship when it is chronically lengthened by CAPD.\r"

To accomplish this goal, 18 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) underwent overnight polysomnography with simultaneous monitoring of pressures in the posterior nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and esophagus. From the profile of pressures recorded in the UA and esophagus, the regions over which the UA collapses during apneas could be determined. The patients were 54 +/- 14 y of age and were grossly obese with a body mass index of 37 +/- 2 kg/m2. They had moderately severe OSA with a mean apnea plus hypopnea index of 62 +/- 8 per hour. During NREM sleep, 10 of the 18 (56%) patients had collapse confined to the velopharyngeal or retropalatal segment of the upper airway. The remaining 44% of the patients demonstrated collapse of the retroglossal segment of the oropharynx located caudal to the inferior margin of the soft palate. Upper airway collapse at the level of the hyoid bone was not observed during NREM sleep. Observations made during REM sleep in nine patients demonstrated that collapse occurred in a more caudal segment of the UA in seven patients during REM than during NREM sleep. The effect of sleep position was evaluated in 10 patients and found to have little affect on the extent over which the UA collapsed during sleep independent of sleep state. The effects of UPPP on regional UA collapse were evaluated in a small group of six patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a further 7 months of probably high occupational exposure without any specific treatment, he had to quit work because of dyspnea. Despite treatment with systemic corticosteroids and continuous oxygen administration, he died 3 months later in respiratory distress. Postmortem examination of the lung tissue showed a typical giant-cell interstitial fibrosis, with active inflammatory cell infiltration superimposed on an established centrilobular fibrosis. The lung tissue contained 2.1 micrograms cobalt/g wet weight (more than 100-fold the normal concentration); cobalt particles, mainly localized in macrophages, were identified by transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. We speculate that the rapid deterioration and fatal outcome resulted from the continued exposure to cobalt, leading to a high pulmonary concentration of cobalt, and from the oxygen treatment because cobalt promotes the formation of hydroxyl free radicals.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade augments cocaine-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: A cardiac catheterization laboratory in an urban teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty clinically stable patient volunteers referred for catheterization for evaluation of chest pain. INTERVENTIONS: Heart rate, arterial pressure, coronary sinus blood flow (by thermodilution), and epicardial left coronary arterial dimensions were measured before and 15 minutes after intranasal saline or cocaine administration (2 mg/kg body weight) and again after intracoronary propranolol administration (2 mg in 5 minutes). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No variables changed after saline administration. After cocaine administration, arterial pressure and rate-pressure product increased; coronary sinus blood flow fell (139 +/- 28 [mean +/- SE] to 120 +/- 20 mL/min); coronary vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure divided by coronary sinus blood flow) rose (0.87 +/- 0.10 to 1.05 +/- 0.10 mm Hg/mL.min); and coronary arterial diameters decreased by between 6% and 9% (P less than 0.05 for all variables). Subsequently, intracoronary propranolol administration caused no change in arterial pressure or rate-pressure product but further decreased coronary sinus blood flow (to 100 +/- 14 mL/min) and increased coronary vascular resistance (to 1.20 +/- 0.12 mm Hg/mL.min) (P less than 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction is potentiated by beta-adrenergic blockade. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents probably should be avoided in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia or infarction.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied the presence of cytomegalovirus in bronchoalveolar lavage through virus isolation in 21 bone marrow transplant recipients before and after transplantation. All 14 lavage specimens collected before bone marrow transplantation were negative for cytomegalovirus. During the period from 20 to 90 days after transplantation, 12 of 24 lavage specimens (50%) from 14 patients without lung problems were positive for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus was isolated from 4 of 10 lavage specimens (40%) in 7 patients with pneumonia during the same interval. We conclude that culture for cytomegalovirus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is not a reliable method for establishing the virus's causative role in pneumonia soon after bone marrow transplantation. Among 14 patients in whom bronchoalveolar lavage was done at an asymptomatic stage, 6 of 9 patients with cytomegalovirus and none of 5 without cytomegalovirus in the lavage fluid later developed pneumonia. All of the patients subsequently developing pneumonia also had acute graft-versus-host disease, suggesting an immunopathologic mechanism, possibly triggered by cytomegalovirus, for cytomegalovirus-associated pneumonia.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: The liver unit of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 21 patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis. There were four control groups: patients with inactive alcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic persons without liver disease, patients with impaired renal function, and normal subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: With one exception, patients with alcoholic hepatitis had higher tumor necrosis factor levels (mean, 26.3 ng/L; 95% CI, 21.7 to 30.9) than normal subjects (6.4 ng/L; CI, 5.4 to 7.4). Patients who subsequently died had a higher tumor necrosis factor level (34.7 ng/L; CI, 27.8 to 41.6) than survivors (16.6 ng/L; CI, 14.0 to 19.2). In patients with alcoholic hepatitis, tumor necrosis factor levels correlated positively with serum bilirubin (r = 0.74; P = 0.0009) and serum creatinine (r = 0.81; P = 0.0003). Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had higher tumor necrosis factor levels than patients with inactive alcoholic cirrhosis (11.1 ng/L; CI, 8.9 to 13.3) and severely alcoholic persons without liver disease (6.4 ng/L; CI, 5.0 to 7.8). Patients with abnormal renal function had lower tumor necrosis factor levels (14.1 ng/L; CI, 5.4 to 22.8) than patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Serial samples obtained during a 1-week period from patients with alcoholic hepatitis showed no significant change in tumor necrosis factor when patients who died were compared with survivors. No correlation was found between tumor necrosis factor and plasma endotoxin. Levels of interleukin-1 beta did not exceed 20 ng/L. CONCLUSIONS: Elevations in tumor necrosis factor in alcoholic hepatitis are most marked in severe cases, suggesting that tumor necrosis factor plays a role in the pathogenesis.\r"

Some of these can be excluded by the absence of associated findings, that is, sarcoidosis, collagen vascular disease, neoplastic myositis; or on epidemiologic grounds, for example, acute tropical myositis. A muscle biopsy is diagnostic for trichinosis and for granulomatous, neoplastic, and eosinophilic myositis. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate militates against but does not rule out neoplastic or collagen vascular disease-associated myositis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated in most of these disorders although trichinosis is characterized by a very low rate. Most conditions associated with eosinophilia are characterized by both blood and local tissue eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "The life expectancy of patients with aortic aneurysm is significantly prolonged by graft replacement therapy. Regardless, a significant predictor of late death is complications of either residual aortic aneurysmal disease or the development of additional aortic aneurysm. This paper reviews a personal experience in the treatment of 4170 patients with aneurysmal disease of either dissection or medial degenerative origin, indicating that multiple segment involvement was or became present in 1262 (30%) patients, 463 (67%) of 694 patients with dissection, and 799 (23%) of 3476 patients without dissection. Regardless of etiology, multiple involvement varied with the location of the presenting involved segment, i.e., ascending aorta (38%), ascending and arch (70%), descending thoracic aorta (73%), and abdominal aorta (26%). This study was limited in detail to 811 patients who had ascending and ascending and aortic arch replacement for aneurysm. These patients were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) 524 patients with no distal disease; (2) 135 patients with distal disease treated by subtotal replacement in 82 and total replacement in 53; and (3) 152 patients with distal disease not treated. The 5-year survival rate from the time of first operation, including early death from operation was 75% in group 1, 65% in group 2, and 39% in group 3. The causes of death in group 3 patients were aneurysmal rupture and/or associated disease. It is concluded that initial total aortic study and regular postoperative monitoring with computed tomographic scanning is indicated to detect extensive disease or recurrence of disease and that aggressive replacement is indicated except in patients with associated disease that does not permit operation.\r"

Complications were most common (14 of 31 patients, 45%) within the first 30 days after transplantation. Seventeen GI complications were treated medically (2 deaths), 2 with elective surgery and 12 with emergent operations (3 deaths). The overall mortality rate was 16%. All patients who underwent emergent operations within 3 days of onset of symptoms survived; the mean interval of onset between symptoms and operation in the nonsurvivors was 10 +/- 3.8 days. We infer that among patients requiring urgent surgical intervention, successful outcome is enhanced by intense surveillance for early symptoms, prompt diagnostic evaluation, and early surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of sepsis on gut glutamine (GLN) metabolism were studied to gain further insight into the regulation of the altered glutamine metabolism that characterizes critical illnesses. Studies were done in laboratory rats and in hospitalized patients. The human studies were done in seven healthy surgical patients (controls) and six septic patients who underwent laparotomy. Radial artery and portal vein samples were obtained during operation and were analyzed for GLN and oxygen content. Despite no reduction in arterial glutamine concentration in the septic patients, gut glutamine extraction was diminished by 75% (12.0% +/- 1.6% in controls vs. 2.8% +/- 0.8% in septic patients, p less than 0.01). Similarly gut oxygen extraction was diminished by nearly 50% in the septic patients (p less than 0.05). To further investigate these abnormalities, endotoxin (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or saline (controls) was administered to adult rats 12 hours before cannulation of the carotid artery and portal vein. The arterial GLN concentration was increased by 13% in the endotoxin-treated animals (p less than 0.05) but gut glutamine uptake was diminished by 46% (526 +/- 82 nmol/100 g BW/minute in controls vs. 282 +/- 45 in endotoxin, p less than 0.01). Simultaneously gut glutaminase activity was diminished by 30% (p less than 0.01) and intestinal glutamate release fell by two thirds. Blood cultures were negative in control animals (0 of 20), but were positive in 25% of endotoxemic animals (6 of 24) for gram-negative rods (p = 0.019). Sepsis and endotoxemia impair gut glutamine metabolism. This impairment may be etiologic in the breakdown of the gut mucosal barrier and in the development of bacterial translocation.\r"

The prognosis of women diagnosed with melanoma during a pregnancy continues to be debated. One hundred patients, ages 19 to 40 years, have been identified who were pregnant at the time of diagnosis of their melanoma. All were treated with local excision. Sixteen per cent underwent elective lymph node dissections. Immunotherapy was administered to 83% of patients. Mean follow-up was 6.8 years from the date of diagnosis. The patients were compared to an age-matched group of 86 women who were not pregnant at the time of diagnosis. Overall mortality during the follow-up period was 25% in the pregnant group and 23% in the control group. Among the pregnant group, there was an increased incidence of lymph node metastases during the follow-up period (39% versus 26%, p = 0.053). Among stage I patients, there was a significantly shorter DFI for the pregnant group (p = 0.039), with 50% of pregnant patients and 67% of control patients free of disease at 10 years. Similarly, among stage 1 patients, the time to development of lymph node metastases was shorter in the pregnant group (p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pregnancy at diagnosis was significantly associated with the development of metastatic disease (p = 0.008), when controlling for tumor site, thickness, and Clark level. Patients who developed melanoma during pregnancy did not, however, have a significant decrease in survival.\r"

Splenic injuries were graded I to V, and splenorrhaphy was attempted except when the spleen was shattered or when multiple injuries with associated hypotension were present. Penetrating wounds, blunt trauma, or iatrogenic/unknown etiologies were present in 54.2%, 41.6%, and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Grade I or II injuries were present in 51.7% of patients, grade III in 34.6%, grade IV or V in 9.6%, and unknown grade in 4.1%. The technique of splenorrhaphy was simple suture (usually chromic) with or without the addition of topical hemostatic agents in 200 patients (83.3%), topical agents alone in 12 (5%), unknown type of repair in 12 (5%), compression, cautery, or nonbleeding injury in 9 (3.8%), and partial or hemisplenectomy in 7 (2.9%). Postoperative rebleeding occurred in three patients (1.3%) with grade II, III, and IV injuries, respectively, and led to splenectomy at reoperation. In another patient who had a hemisplenectomy performed for a grade IV injury, subphrenic abscesses and septic shock led to the death of the patient. Splenorrhaphy can be safely performed in properly selected adult patients after a variety of injuries. The risk of rebleeding is practically nil when the spleen is fully mobilized and visualized during repair.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade splenic salvage procedures rather than splenectomy have been considered the preferred treatment for traumatic splenic injuries. Splenic preservation has been most often accomplished by splenorrhaphy and more recently by a controversial nonoperative approach. This report delineates indications, contraindications, and results with splenectomy, splenorrhaphy, and nonoperative treatment based on an 11-year experience (1978 to 1989) in which 193 consecutive adult patients with splenic injuries were treated. One hundred sixty-seven patients (86.5%) underwent urgent operation. Of these, 111 (66%) were treated by splenorrhaphy or partial splenectomy and 56 (34%) were treated by splenectomy. During the last 4 years, 26 additional patients (13.5%) were managed without operation. Patients considered for nonoperative treatment were alert, hemodynamically stable with computed tomographic evidence of isolated grades I to III splenic injuries. Overall 24% of the injuries resulted from penetrating trauma, whereas 76% of the patients sustained blunt injuries. Complications were rare, with two patients in the splenorrhaphy group experiencing re-bleeding (1.8%) and one patient (4%) failing nonoperative treatment. The mortality rate for the entire group was 4%. This report documents that splenorrhaphy can safely be performed in 65% to 75% of splenic injuries. Splenectomy is indicated for more extensive injuries or when patients are hemodynamically unstable in the presence of life-threatening injuries. Nonoperative therapy can be accomplished safely in a small select group (15% to 20%), with a success rate of nearly 90% if strict criteria for selection are met.\r"

Computed tomographic scans and operative findings were graded by a splenic injury scoring system. Two patients were classified as having grade 1, 21 as grade 2, 11 as grade 3, and 3 as grade 4 splenic injuries. Computed tomography underestimated the degree of injury in 9 of 17 (53%) operated patients (mean CT score, 2.6; mean operative score, 3.3; p less than 0.01). Six of sixteen adults and 19 of 21 children were intentionally treated by observation.

The failure rate of observation was lower in children (16%) than in adults (33%), even though children had a higher Splenic Injury Score (2.4 versus 1.8). Patients who underwent an operation received twice as much blood as the observed group. There was no significant difference in Injury Severity Score or total fluid requirements between operated and observed patients. Operations increased in frequency in both adults and children as the injury score increased. This experience suggests that CT scan accurately determines the presence of splenic injury but commonly underestimates its severity. While children with grades 1 through 3 injuries are likely to be treated successfully with observation, adults who have more minor splenic injuries often fail observation and may be treated better by prompt operation.\r"

  ".W": "Both map-guided endocardial resection (ER) and the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) are currently used for surgical treatment of patients who have sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Some authors have preferred AICD implant due to a lower published operative mortality rate. To determine if there is a discrepancy in mortality rates between the two techniques, we analyzed hospital survival in 46 patients undergoing ER and in 44 patients undergoing AICD implantation during the same 3-year period. Two ER patients (4%) died before hospital discharge. Two patients (4%) died after AICD implantation. At predischarge electrophysiologic study five patients (11%) had inducible ventricular tachycardia and received antiarrhythmic drug therapy after ER. In contrast 35 of 42 patients surviving AICD placement received chronic long-term antiarrhythmic therapy (p less than 0.05 compared to ER). Our experience shows that ER and AICD placement may be carried out with similar procedure-related mortality and morbidity rates. Lower operative risks should not be a reason for choosing the AICD over ER for surgical treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The AICD may actually improve the results of ER by offering an alternative to ventriculotomy in poor-risk surgical candidates.\r"

  ".U": "90253249\r", 
  ".W": "Although the etiology of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is unknown, its manifestations resemble those of nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, including, anecdotally, the apparent ability to evoke extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine in what manner pouchitis and EIMs were associated. The computerized records of 819 consecutive patients who underwent IPAA between January 1981 and December 1988 were reviewed. Eighty-five patients were excluded (because of incomplete follow-up, death, or permanent ileostomy). Follow-up of the remaining 734 patients was complete (mean, 41 months). The mean age was 32 years and the ratio of men to women was 1:1. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed for chronic ulcerative colitis in 91% of patients and for familial adenomatous polyposis in 9%. Pouchitis occurred in 31% of chronic ulcerative colitis patients and 6% of familial adenomatous polyposis patients (p less than 0.01). The mean time to first occurrence was 17 months. Pouchitis recurred in 61% of patients at risk. Patients with preoperative and postoperative EIMs had significantly higher rates of pouchitis than did patients without EIMs (39% preoperative EIMs versus 26% with no EIMs, p less than 0.001; 53% postoperative EIMs versus 25% with no EIMs, p less than 0.001). Of patients with pouchitis in whom EIMs resolved after IPAA but then recurred (n = 12), EIMs recurred when pouchitis occurred and abated when pouchitis was treated in seven patients. We concluded that pouchitis occurred frequently after IPAA and that patients with EIMs were at higher risk of developing pouchitis than were patients who never had EIMs. Furthermore some patients experienced a temporal relationship between flares of EIMs and pouchitis. These results imply that pouchitis may be a novel manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease persisting after operation.\r"

  ".W": "Liquid elemental diets (ED) will, in time, cause atrophy of the gut. Pentagastrin (PG), neurotensin (NT), and bombesin (BBS) are peptides that have trophic effects on the gut of normal rats. This study examined the effect of these three agents on gut atrophy produced by ED. Four groups of rats were given an ED and injected with either saline (control), PG (250 micrograms/kg), NT (300 micrograms/kg), or BBS (10 micrograms/kg) subcutaneously every 8 hours for 5 or 10 days. A fifth group was fed rat chow ad libidum. The rats were killed on day 6 or 11; the pancreas and segments of small intestine were removed. Atrophy of ileal mucosa was apparent on days 6 and 11, and atrophy of jejunal mucosa was manifest by day 11. Bombesin prevented jejunal mucosal atrophy and significantly increased ileal mucosal growth (compared with control). Neurotensin prevented the jejunal, but not the ileal, mucosal atrophy produced by ED. Pentagastrin had no effect on gut mucosa. Bombesin and PG, but not NT, stimulated pancreatic growth. Neurotensin stimulates pancreaticobiliary secretions (PBS), which are known to stimulate gut growth. Jejunoileal bypass was performed to determine whether trophic effects of NT on gut mucosa were mediated through stimulation of PBS. After 1 week treatment, animals were killed and segments of intestine removed. As expected NT was trophic for gut mucosa in continuity with the luminal stream; furthermore NT produced significant stimulation of growth of gut mucosa in the bypassed segment. We conclude that both BBS and NT are trophic for intestinal mucosa of rats given ED; both agents have a more pronounced effect on jejunum. The trophic effect of NT is mediated, in part, by a mechanism unrelated to stimulation of PBS. Bombesin and NT may have important regulatory functions in the adaptive growth of small bowel mucosa and in the maintenance of gut mucosal integrity.\r"

The infection was in the aortic valve in 37 patients, the mitral valve in 18, the aortic and mitral valves in 5, and the tricuspid valve in 2. Twenty-four patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were responsible for 86% of the infections. Annular abscess was encountered in 33 patients. Complex valve procedures involving reconstruction of the left ventricular inflow or outflow tract or both were performed in 31 patients. There were three operative deaths (4.8%). Predictors of operative mortality were prosthetic valve endocarditis, preoperative shock, and annular abscess. Patients were followed for 1 month to 130 months (mean follow-up, 43 months). Only 1 patient required reoperation for persistent infection. There were ten late deaths. Most survivors (96%) are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. The 5-year actuarial survival was 79% +/- 7%. These data demonstrate excellent results in patients with native valve endocarditis, and support the premise that patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis should have early surgical intervention.\r"

Indications for operation were heart failure (30 patients), severe valvular regurgitation (4), uncontrolled sepsis (2), septic emboli (3), and other (1 patient). Time between onset of endocarditis symptoms and operation ranged from 12 to 45 days (mean, 30 days). The aortic valve was involved in 3 patients; the mitral valve, in 28; both valves, in 7; and the tricuspid valve, in 2. There was no previous underlying valve pathology in 40%. Lesions found were cusp perforation (17 patients), annular abscess (4), vegetation (13), and chordal rupture (22). Positive blood cultures were found in 30 patients (75%). Bacterial findings were Streptococcus in 12 patients (30%), Staphylococcus in 15 (37.5%), gram-negative in 3 (7.5%), and unknown in 10 (25%). Criteria to perform valve repair were adequate antibiotic therapy for at least 1 week and large excision of all macroscopically involved tissues. In all cases, Carpentier's reconstructive techniques were used. Perioperative mortality was 2.5% (1 patient). Reoperation was necessary in 1 patient. Late mortality was 2.5% (1 patient). Repair was assessed either by angiography or by Doppler echocardiography before hospital discharge: 32 patients showed no regurgitation, whereas 7 had mild regurgitation (3 aortic, 4 mitral). Mean follow-up of 30 months was achieved in all survivors. There was no recurrence of endocarditis and no reoperation for valvular insufficiency. We conclude that valve repair in acute endocarditis is possible and effective in most instances.\r"

Penetrating Barrett's ulcer resistant to treatment was the indication for resection in 5 patients. Ulcers penetrated to the pericardium (1 patient), pulmonary vein (1), lung (1), and mediastinum (2). Other indications for resection included undilatable strictures (2), previous operations (4), high-grade dysplasia (3), parietal cells lining the esophagus (1), patient's refusal of long-term surveillance (2), and the inability to exclude adenocarcinoma preoperatively (2). Reconstruction was achieved by colon interposition (15) or esophagogastrostomy (4), with one postoperative death. Mean follow-up was 41 months and was 100% complete. Of the 18 patients, 3 have occasional regurgitation but none have any dysphagia or weight loss. Esophageal resection is indicated in a select group of patients with Barrett's esophagus. Absolute indications include a deep penetrating ulcer confirmed intraoperatively, high-grade dysplasia, strong suspicion of cancer, and multiple previous operations. Relative indications include strictures not responding to dilation and young patients refusing long-term surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "Brachytherapy, the permanent or temporary implantation of radioactive sources, has been performed in limited numbers of patients with lung cancer over the last 50 years. Because of renewed interest in this modality, we reviewed our experience with 103 patients treated over a 7-year period. The mean age of this group was 55.5 years (range, 1 to 84 years). Primary lung cancer accounted for 82 patients (79.6%); metastatic lesions to the lung, 13 (12.6%); and mediastinal malignancies, 8 (7.8%). Indications for brachytherapy included mediastinal and chest wall invasion in 42 patients (40.8%), unresectable tumors and mediastinal adenopathy in 30 (29.1%), medical contraindications to extensive pulmonary resection in 20 (19.4%), and irradiation of excised lymph node beds in 11 (10.7%). Seeds labeled with radioactive iodine 125 alone were used in 65 patients (63.1%), afterloading catheters containing iridium 192 sources in 25 (24.3%), and both in 13 (12.6%). There were no operative deaths. With a mean follow-up of 18.6 months, the mean and median survivals for the entire group were 17.3 and 14.0 months, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survivals for the entire group were 67.9%, 38.7%, and 27.8%, respectively. In summary, brachytherapy offers a useful surgical approach in patients in whom unresectable pulmonary or mediastinal malignancies are found at the time of thoracotomy or in patients previously treated with other modalities for whom limited therapeutic alternatives exist.\r"

Catheterization revealed the confluence of the pulmonary veins draining into a descending vein below the diaphragm. Symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension and low cardiac output were typical. All had repair with circulatory arrest (average time, 32 minutes). Mobilization of the pulmonary veins and the descending vein is important. The descending vein was transected at the diaphragm. Its anterior surface was incised through the confluence of the pulmonary veins, thus creating an open Y incision. This large Y-shaped vein was anastomosed to the left atrium and carried obliquely to the tip of the left atrial appendage. The anastomosis was fashioned so that the long limb of the Y rotated anteriorly and superiorly to substantially enlarge the left atrium, making the total diameter of the anastomosis larger than the mitral valve orifice. This simplified the surgical repair and allowed direct suture closure of the atrial septal defect in all patients, as the left atrial size was at least doubled. No postoperative complications occurred, and the patients were discharged an average of 4.2 days postoperatively. Restudy at an average of 3.5 years revealed normal pressures and normal architecture by angiography. Use of the descending vein as an integral part of the reconstruction and enlargement of the left atrium was the major technical factor leading to a successful outcome in these patients and eliminating a patch or transposition of the atrial septum.\r"

Three patients required emergency operation immediately after valvuloplasty, and the other 42 had an elective operation a mean of 7.8 months afterward. All but 3 of these patients had major progression of symptoms, and all had valvular restenosis. In spite of the high-risk status of these patients, there were only four hospital deaths among the 45 patients. Three additional patients have died a mean of 11.4 months postoperatively. The condition of all survivors remains clinically improved after the valve operations. Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty must be recognized as a palliative procedure, and should be reserved for patients who are truly not candidates for operation or situations in which a brief period of reduction in gradient might improve a patient's condition before operation.\r"

  ".U": "90253263\r", 
  ".W": "Aortic stenosis was relieved in 11 patients by ultrasonic debridement of the valve and annulus, while 102 other patients underwent valve replacement for aortic stenosis during 1988. Debridement was selectively applied based on findings of small annulus size (19 mm or less) and extensive calcification. Additional patient characteristics were mean transvalvular gradient of 78 mm Hg, advanced age, and marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Six patients had no residual gradient and 5 others a mean gradient less than 10 mm Hg. There were no complications related to the debridement process. Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler echocardiography demonstrated improved leaflet mobility and elimination of the gradient in all patients and elimination of associated valvular insufficiency in 2 patients. Follow-up echocardiography demonstrated late onset of new valvular regurgitation in 5 patients that was progressive and required reoperation in 3. Thickened, hardened, and retracted valve leaflets with loss of central coaptation were found in all 3 patients who underwent reoperation. Ultrasonic debridement can effectively relieve aortic stenosis, provide an excellent immediate hemodynamic result, and decrease operative time. However, the early occurrence of aortic insufficiency in a high percentage of patients makes it an unacceptable alternative to valve replacement, and the technique should be abandoned as a treatment for severe calcific aortic stenosis.\r"

After three days, cyclosporine administration was discontinued and azathioprine administration was maintained at a suboptimal dose to allow a graded response to the pulmonary allograft. Dogs were monitored by chest roentgenogram, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and sampling of peripheral blood lymphocytes at weekly intervals. Open lung biopsies also were performed at weekly intervals in 5 of the dogs. Lymphocytes from the BAL and peripheral blood and those grown in culture from open and transbronchial biopsy specimens were tested for donor-specific cytotoxicity (DSC) by testing their responsiveness to lymphocytes from their donor. Rejection was confirmed in all animals. Donor-specific cytotoxicity became detectable in all animals in either the BAL fluid or biopsy specimens. An abnormal chest roentgenogram developed in 9 dogs, but not until after DSC was detected in the BAL in 7. In the open biopsy specimens tested for DSC, all exhibited DSC synchronous with the first changes noted on chest roentgenogram. Donor-specific cytotoxicity was sensitive for detecting rejection in 8 of 9 dogs in the BAL and in 5 of 5 dogs in the open biopsy specimens. Based on these results, 3 additional dogs were maintained on cyclosporine. Two of these dogs did not reject their transplants and had no evidence of DSC. We conclude that donor-specific functional assays provide an advance over less sensitive clinical techniques.\r"

In a first period (1970 to 1977) treatment consisted solely of radical resection in 3 patients; chemotherapy was added to operation in 6, and local radiotherapy was added in 2. Since 1977, 14 patients were treated according to a comprehensive therapy protocol including radical resection (six pneumonectomies, one bilobectomy, seven lobectomies), chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, and prophylactic cranial irradiation. Eleven patients, in whom N2 disease was confirmed preoperatively, received chemotherapy as the first step, followed by \"adjuvant\" resection. Projected 5-year survival rate is 25% for the entire N2 group and 47% for the comprehensively treated group. Seven patients of this latter group are alive 12, 19, 30, 48, 66, 73, and 74 months after comprehensive therapy, equivalent to an observed 2-year survival rate of 38%. This is the largest reported series of patients with resected small cell lung carcinoma in the N2 stage treated at a single institution; the results are so encouraging that we can no longer advocate general refusal of radical lung resection for small cell lung carcinoma in the N2 stage if it is part of a multimodal therapeutic protocol.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six (4.6%) patients required exploration for hemorrhage after 788 coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Twenty-three (64%) patients with a specific site of bleeding that was surgically controlled or with improving coagulopathy were managed by immediate sternal closure. Continued hemorrhage or tamponade necessitated reexploration in 5 of these patients. All 5 patients were then treated by open sternotomy and delayed sternal closure. There were no deaths or sternal wound infections in this subgroup. Thirteen (36%) patients explored for hemorrhage were initially treated by open sternotomy and delayed sternal closure because of ongoing coagulopathy with refractory bleeding. Twelve patients recovered without further complication. One patient died 30 days after delayed sternal closure. There were no sternal wound infections. This experience supports a selective approach to sternal closure after exploration for hemorrhage following coronary artery bypass grafting. Immediate closure is recommended if a specific site of bleeding can be located and corrected. However, in the presence of refractory hemorrhage due to coagulopathy, delayed sternal closure should be considered to avoid the subsequent morbidity of continued bleeding, including cardiac tamponade, multiple reexplorations with sternal trauma, and retained mediastinal hematoma.\r"

Their ages ranged from 5 months to 20 years (mean age, 3.5 years). Eight patients had had 13 prior systemic-pulmonary arterial shunts. There were six hospital deaths (24%). Three patients needed a repeat right ventricular outflow reconstruction. There was one late death. The other patients manifested clinical improvement; hematocrit decreased from 0.54 to 0.43 (p less than 0.01) and arterial oxygen saturation increased from 63.0% to 83.2% (p less than 0.01). The size of the pulmonary artery, defined as the ratio of the sum of the diameter of the right and left pulmonary arteries to the diameter of the descending aorta, increased from 0.72 to 2.06 (p less than 0.01). Sixteen patients underwent a corrective operation 2.4 years after palliation. The results of palliative right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction suggest that it may be an optional strategy for the treatment of symptomatic patients who have tetralogy of Fallot with severely hypoplastic pulmonary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "We previously described a technique for en bloc double-lung transplantation that was initially applied to select patients with cystic fibrosis and emphysema. This procedure is quite complex and associated with several limitations, including a substantial incidence of airway ischemia, postoperative myocardial depression, and cardiac denervation. To address these problems we have developed a simpler procedure for replacing both lungs. The operation is done through a transverse thoracosternotomy and involves sequential replacement of the two lungs. Positive features include separate bronchial anastomoses to reduce ischemic airway complications, elimination of the need for total cardiopulmonary bypass and a period of ischemic cardiac arrest, improved exposure to reduce intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage, and maintenance of cardiac innervation. Additionally, the technique can be more easily mastered and widely applied. Details of the procedure and its initial clinical application in 3 patients having emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiolitis obliterans following previous double-lung transplantation, respectively, are described. All 3 patients recovered without complication. Postoperative function was excellent in spite of lung ischemic times ranging up to 91/2 hours.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of prolonged storage at 4 degrees C in nutrient medium on the antigenic properties of aortic valve allografts are unknown. Lewis rats received heterotopic aortic valve allografts from Brown Norway donors. Valves were transplanted immediately after harvest (fresh), or after antibiotic sterilization and storage in a nutrient medium at 4 degrees C for 3, 7, 14, or 21 days. Additional rats underwent sham laparotomy (sham). All recipient rats received Brown Norway skin grafts 3 weeks after valve transplant or sham procedure. Time to skin graft rejection for all groups was as follows: fresh (n = 10), 4.5 +/- 0.9 days; sham (n = 10), 7.1 +/- 0.3 days; 3-day (n = 10), 4.9 +/- 0.3 days; 7-day (n = 10), 5.2 +/- 0.4 days; 14-day (n = 10), 6.1 +/- 0.7 days; and 21-day (n = 10), 6.0 +/- 0.6 days. Significant differences existed between the sham group and each of the transplanted groups. No significant differences existed between the fresh group and either the 3-day or 7-day groups. The difference between the fresh group and the 14-day group approached significance (0.05 less than p less than 0.10), and the difference between the fresh and 21-day groups was significant (p less than 0.05). Additional valves not used for transplantation were studied with scanning electron microscopy. The valves preserved in nutrient medium exhibited a progressive loss of endothelium as compared with fresh valves. Storage of aortic valve allografts in a nutrient medium at 4 degrees C is associated with a progressive attenuation of antigenic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The optimal procedure for shunting palliation in cyanotic infants remains to be determined. Sixty-two infants less than 3 months of age underwent 63 modified Blalock-Taussig shunts. Their age range at operation was 1 to 84 days (mean, 16 +/- 20 days). Shunts were constructed using 5-mm polytetrafluorethylene tubes in 20 patients and 4-mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 43 patients. There were 13 early deaths (21%; CL, 15% to 27%) of which three deaths (5%; confidence limits, 2% to 9%) were shunt related. The survivors were followed up from 6 to 53 months (mean, 29 +/- 12.5 months). Shunt failure (occlusion, inadequate palliation) occurred in 27 patients. The overall probability rate of adequate shunt function was 58% +/- 8% at 2 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the size of the graft was a risk factor of shunt failure. Severe distortion of the pulmonary arterial branch was noted in 12 patients. The inferences are: (1) modified Blalock-Taussig shunts provide satisfactory early palliation but late shunt failure is frequent; (2) similar results should be obtained with other shunting procedures; and (3) the optimal procedure should be selected for each cyanotic infant on an individual basis.\r"

Nine patients were regarded as being susceptible to hepatitis B; 7 lacked hepatitis B markers, and records of serological status could not be found for the other 2. Four of the susceptible patients received hepatitis B immunoglobulin postoperatively, and 1 of them also received one 10-micrograms dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The 9 susceptible patients underwent hepatitis B serological studies a mean of 17 months (range, 4 to 31 months) postoperatively. In only 1 patient, tested 29 months after operation, had antibodies to hepatitis B surface, hepatitis B core, and hepatitis B e antigens developed. He had not experienced a clinical episode of hepatitis, and results of liver function tests were normal. He had not received prophylaxis. Because hepatitis B virus may be transmitted by hepatitis B surface antigen-positive, hepatitis B e antigen-negative valves, prophylaxis should be given whenever they are used and follow-up serological studies undertaken.\r"

We have developed an approach to the problem and a technique for repair. Compression of the area with early institution of cardiopulmonary bypass will result in decompression of the right ventricle and preservation of perfusion, preventing profound hypotension. Coverage with an onlay autologous tissue patch provides hemostatic control of the defect without compromising ventricular function. Reinforcement with omentum or muscle flap can give additional protection when risk of infection is present. Application of these principles can be lifesaving and insure good cardiac function despite massive injury to the right ventricular myocardium.\r"

The unusually early recoarctation was presumably due to residual and active duct tissue in the repair margins.\r"

This finding was significantly greater than the accepted 0.6%, estimated for the general population. Four of the 7 girls with early sexual maturation had physical disabilities (i.e., 3 with cerebral palsy, 1 neurosensory deafness) which indicated that 10% of the 40 physically disabled girls had early sexual maturation. Three (2.5%) of 121 girls without physical disabilities matured early. Sexual maturation began 5 years or longer after the diagnosis of neonatal encephalopathy. An increased incidence of early sexual maturation in girls with neonatal encephalopathy indicates the importance of long-term follow-up of this population. This study provides an indication of a link between newborn illnesses causing neonatal encephalopathy and early sexual maturation in girls without progressive, structural, intracranial pathology and suggests further study of some girls previously diagnosed as having idiopathic precocious puberty.\r"

  ".W": "Short trachea, typically due to reduced tracheal cartilage ring number, produces high tracheal bifurcation which can be demonstrated in radiographs with evaluable air bronchograms. Accidental bronchial intubation with sequelae has been reported in short trachea patients who have tracheal intubation. Short trachea is associated with a number of syndromes, including DiGeorge anomaly and several types of congenital heart disease and skeletal dysplasias. Review of chest radiographs of 87 patients with myelomeningocele revealed that 31 (36%) had short tracheas. Two patients had a total of 3 episodes of bronchial intubation. This degree of association of short trachea with myelomeningocele, the frequency of myelomeningocele, and the number of surgical procedures performed on many such patients suggest that special attention to the short trachea is warranted in myelomeningocele patients because of the risk of accidental bronchial intubation and subsequent sequelae. Twelve (14%) of the myelomeningocele patients lacked radiographic evidence of the presence of twelfth ribs and 11 (13%) had hypoplasia of the twelfth ribs.\r"

Both patients were younger than 10 years of age and developed subacute symptoms and signs. Serial computed tomography demonstrated complete resolution of the hematomas and no development of hydrocephalus during nonsurgical treatment. They recovered well without any neurologic deficits. In order to evaluate an indicative factor for nonsurgical treatment in young children with posterior fossa epidural hematoma, we review both of our patients and 36 well-documented patients from the literature, all of whom were younger than 10 years of age. The results demonstrate that the development of hydrocephalus is a critical factor in clinical progression. Nonsurgical management can be applied in these circumstances until spontaneous resolution of the hematoma unless early signs of medullary compression appear acutely after head trauma or serial computed tomography demonstrates the development of hydrocephalus followed by medullary compression.\r"

Comparison of our patient with previously reported cases leads us to conclude that myositis in Kawasaki disease usually is present within 1-3 weeks of illness; the symptoms usually are mild and probably remain unnoticed by most physicians, but weakness can be severe and respiratory failure may occur. The degree of creatine kinase elevation may be useful in predicting the severity of myopathy and in alerting the physician to the need for close respiratory monitoring.

In these forms, the motor nerve conduction velocities were decreased significantly over both proximal (cord-to-elbow) and distal (elbow-to-wrist) segments in both the nerves as compared with normal values; however, the mean motor nerve conduction velocities in the proximal segments were faster than those in the distal segments by about the same amount as the normal controls. These findings indicate that motor conduction abnormalities in Werdnig-Hoffmann disease are diffuse over the entire course of the nerve and appear to eliminate a dying-back process in which the affected axons are severely damaged, beginning with the more distal sites.\r"

This result suggests that phenylephrine increases arterial blood flow and vascular resistance in vascular beds which may lead to the rupture of weak vessels in premature infants. Cytochrome a, a3, however, was not affected by the drug. Conversely, a low-dose dopamine infusion had no effect on cerebral hemodynamics, but high-dose decreased blood pressure and cerebral oxyhemoglobin, and increased deoxyhemoglobin without appreciable changes in cerebral blood flow, which suggests venous congestion and arterial blood reduction in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Calcification of ischemic lesions in a child's brain is well recognized by pathologists; however, clinicians and radiologists usually associate cerebral calcification with infections, particularly the TORCH organisms. We illustrate this phenomenon in a 5-month-old infant with extensive, calcified, multicystic encephalomalacia without evidence of a cerebral infection. In order to ascertain the incidence of cerebral calcification in pure hypoxic-ischemic lesions, we retrospectively analyzed 486 consecutive autopsies. Ninety-nine patients had histologic evidence of cerebral hypoxic-ischemic lesions and hypoxia or ischemia. Thirty-nine of these patients displayed microscopic calcification; 23 patients had slight, 12 had minor, and 4 had prominent calcifications. Prominent calcification lesions were large enough to be detected by routine radiologic methods. Correlations between degree of calcification and the underlying disease process and between the gestational age and the length of survival were not statistically significant. This study illustrates the very frequent occurrence of brain calcification in ischemic brain lesions in children. It is necessary to include this diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of cerebral calcification.\r"

Two of its disadvantages most frequently espoused are the difficulty in making the external incision atraumatically and the resulting scar. To diminish these concerns, different incision lines and methods of exposure have been proposed by various authors. These are reviewed along with our preferred technique. We reviewed 100 consecutive cases of open rhinoplasty, yielding 81 patients who underwent subjective and objective scar analysis. There was 1 subjective failure (1.2%), and 2 minor objective failures (2.5%). Recommendations are made to minimize difficulties in performing the open approach and to maximize scar cosmesis.\r"

Demineralized bone has been shown to induce phenotypic conversion of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, with bone formation within 29 days (osteoinduction). In this clinical study, 75 demineralized bone implants were followed up from 1 to 48 months (average follow-up, 14.3 months). There were 41 major dorsal implants, with an average degree of resorption of 50.7%. Eight dorsal implants were followed up for more than 24 months, with an 82.5% degree of resorption. Overall resorption for all implants was 49%. Major factors contributing to implant resorption included lack of surrounding mesenchymal cells and inadequate contact between host tissue and bone-inducing surface area. Other factors included infection, poor vascularity, and compression of the implant. Demineralized bone has an unacceptably high resorption rate and should only be used in highly selective cases where the implant can be positioned in a site rich in primitive mesenchymal or bone-forming cells.\r"

The average age was 2 years 4 months and average weight was 12.8 kg. The most common indication for surgery was upper airway obstruction with apnea. One hundred sixty-two of 190 patients were discharged on the day following surgery. Complications were seen in 20 (10.5%) patients, 16 requiring prolongation of hospital stay and 4 requiring readmission. However, apart from one child with cerebral palsy who had multiple post-operative complications, no other child required reintubation, blood transfusion, or return to the operating room. It is concluded that age should not be a factor in determining whether or not to proceed with a tonsillectomy.\r"

Between 30 and 60 J/cm2, the larynx appeared normal, and when 70 to 100 J/cm2 was applied, only mild edema and erythema were seen. Simultaneously, a thermocouple probe was used and a 0.4 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C temperature rise found. Thus, the gold vapor laser seems capable of achieving the therapeutic photosensitizing effect without causing significant laryngeal edema or thermal activity.\r"

Ten patients (45%) had middle ear effusions evident on examination. Sixteen patients (73%) had hearing loss in at least one ear at the time of examination. Sensorineural losses were evident in 37% of patients. No malformations of the otic capsule were noted on computed tomography.

A preliminary study was conducted with a normal subject and four patients: one with sulcus vocalis, one with Reinke's edema, and two with carcinoma. The stiffness estimated using this method was 3 to 4 g/cm for the normal vocal fold. The stiffness for carcinoma and sulcus vocalis was significantly greater than that of normal vocal fold tissue. The stiffness of Reinke's edema did not differ markedly from that of normal tissue.\r"

Following inhalation exposure to diphenylmethane diisocyanate, our patient developed persistent repeated airway obstruction during inspiration. Fiberoptic rhinolaryngoscopy showed that the epiglottis obstructed the glottic airway during each inspiratory cycle. The epiglottic dysfunction was also well demonstrated by barium contrast cineradiography. Total epiglottectomy resulted in resolution of the patient's upper airway obstructive symptoms. Histologically, marked inflammatory changes of the epiglottis were noted, including a focal infiltrative pattern, focal fibrosis, edema, and reactive changes.\r"

Our laboratories have isolated SIV-like viruses from two East African subspecies of C. aethiops designated grivet and vervet monkeys. Analysis of the structural proteins based on the molecular weights and immunologic cross-reactivity to the prototypic SIV(MAC), HIV-1, and HIV-2 isolates suggests that these viruses are distinctly different. Heterogeneity was observed in the molecular weights of the gag, pol, and env gene products between SIV isolates from vervets [SIV(AGM(VER))] and grivets [SIV(AGM(GRI))]. Phenotypically, SIV(AGM(VER)) isolates were distinguishable from SIV(AGM(GRI)) isolates by the apparent size difference of the major core antigen p24. All SIV(AGM(GRI)) and SIV(AGM(VER)) isolates were found to encode a transmembrane protein of approximately 40 kD (gp40) in contrast to gp32 of SIV(MAC). Furthermore, the transmembrane protein was shown to be encoded by the entire env open reading frame, unlike gp32 of SIC(MAC) or gp36 of SIV(AGM(TYO-1)). These data indicate that viruses from C. aethiops share common features with SIV(MAC) and HIV-1, but represent diverse SIV-like viruses which may vary according to subspecies and geographic location.\r"

Sequential bleeds from an infected lab worker and chimpanzees, both infected with the HTLV-IIIB, were immunoreactive only with the 3B peptide. In contrast, 33 HTLV-III-infected individuals were immunoreactive with the HTLV-III(MN) peptide. Of these 33 individuals, 23 were also immunoreactive with the HTLV-III(SC) peptide, and 18 with the HTLV-III(WMJ2) peptide. The data suggest that HTLV-III strains related to MN are most prevalent among HTLV-III-infected individuals. The binding specificities of goat sera generated against either of these synthetic peptides or the C-terminal fragment of gp120 (PB-1, amino acid 287-467, derived from the HTLV-III isolates 3B, RF, MN, WMJ2, and SC) were also determined. Four different ELISA formats (peptide sera/peptide antigens, peptide sera/PB-1 antigens, PB-1 sera/PB-1 antigens, and PB-1 sera/peptide antigens) were utilized to determine the cross-reactivity patterns of goat sera with the antigens. Goat sera generated against MN and SC sequences (PB-1 proteins, as well as synthetic peptides) were highly cross reactive. Thus, patient sera cross reactivity to multiple strains of the principal neutralizing domain may reflect the antigenic relatedness of the virus isolates rather than multiple infection events or strains generated during disease progression.\r"

These results were compared with changes in CD4+ cell number and episodes of lymphadenopathy. Twenty-five subjects had antibodies of at least one isotype reactive to at least one HIV-1 protein by Western blot at visit 1, before they became ELISA positive. NA reactive with HIV-1IIIB were detected before those reactive with HIV-1RF. NA were first observed in 11 sera at visit 2, in 22 sera at visit 3, and in 3 sera at visit 4; sera from three patients remained nonneutralizing through visit 5. In most cases, NA were detected after a decline in CD4+ cell numbers. The data are consistent with the interpretation that NA develop after about 16 to 18 months of declining CD4+ cell numbers, following which the rate of decline in CD4+ cell numbers slows. In contrast, HIV-1 envelope antigen-specific ADCC responses were first observed in 11 subjects at visit 1 when all 39 were NA and ELISA negative, in 12 subjects at visit 2, in 13 subjects at visit 3, and 1 subject at visit 4. Early ADCC responses were associated with high mean % CD4+ cell numbers and absence of lymphadenopathy throughout the 2-year observation period. Not all subjects who developed ADCC developed NA. In some subjects, ADCC and NA were detectable for the first time at the same visit, for others ADCC was detectable prior to NA, and for a few NA was detectable prior to ADCC. These findings suggest that ADCC and neutralization are mediated by different antibody populations, that they may partially inhibit the progress of HIV-1 infection, and that the late appearance of NA may relate to the failure of immunity to effect recovery from this infection.\r"

  ".W": "A radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was developed to detect antibodies to the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The assay, which utilized recombinant gp120 (rgp120), was quantitative, reproducible, and specific for antibodies to rgp120 or antibodies to native gp120 resulting from natural infection with HIV. Polyethylene glycol-8000 (PEG), used in the assay at a final concentration of 10% to precipitate immune complexes, was demonstrated to be effective in titering sera from different animal species. Provided samples were diluted at least 1:100, antibody titers could be determined either by the classical dilution method or by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared with a positive serum. The humoral response of animals immunized with rgp120 was monitored and a positive correlation was found between titers determined in the RIP assay and the ability of the sera to neutralize. In addition, RIP titers of HIV-positive human sera correlated very well with reactivity obtained in a commercial HIV immunoblot assay. The assay has the advantage of quantitation, fast turnaround time, and versatility.\r"

  ".W": "A human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell line was generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) seropositive donor, which produces a human monoclonal antibody K14 (IgG1), reactive with an epitope on the transmembrane part (gp41) of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1. This monoclonal antibody reacts with a lysate of HIV-1-infected H9 cells, gradient purified HIV-1, and a vaccinia recombinant HIV-1 gp160 protein, but not with HIV-2 antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When used as an immobilized ligand in an immune affinity column, K14 selectively purifies gp41 from a HIV-1-infected H9 cell lysate. Although no reactivity was observed in ELISA with a panel of partially overlapping synthetic nonapeptides spanning the whole length of HIV-1 gp41, it was shown to react with recombinant envelope proteins, provided that they did contain amino acids 643-692: deletion of this part resulted in the disappearance of the reactivity. Testing of an extensive panel of the sera from HIV-1 seropositive or seronegative donors from Europe and Africa, including a selected group of donors before and after HIV-1 seroconversion, in a competition ELISA with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated K14, showed that the epitope recognized on gp41 is immunodominant and conserved. K14 does not neutralize HIV-1 infectivity or virus-mediated cell fusion, and does not mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\r"

Data show a high percentage of positivity for HIV-1 among these lymphadenopathy patients, and surprisingly for HTLV-I, while no such positivity for either virus was found in matched controls or in patients where a different causal agent for lymphadenopathy was found. Of 26 seropositives, 23 deny any risk factor for HIV-1 and do not come from a HTLV-I known endemic area, but while it is impossible to exclude their knowledge of risk factors, it is worth noting that none of them presented a HTLV-I/HIV-1 double infection, which is very frequent in intravenous drug abusers, the major risk group in Italy. On the basis of these data spread of HTLV-I and HIV-1 appears to be more important in Italy than previously thought, and not confined to well-defined groups or, at least, among those who believe they do not belong to a risk group and therefore can represent a major vehicle for virus diffusion. Institution of screening for HTLV-I in blood donors should be taken immediately, and retrovirus infection risk criteria must be revised.\r"

We conducted an investigation to assess the secretion of these cytokines by bronchoalveolar macrophages from patients with progressive stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. The mean level of TNF-alpha produced by macrophages from 9 patients with AIDS was significantly reduced compared with the responses of macrophages from 6 healthy HIV-1-seronegative persons, 6 patients with either asymptomatic HIV-1 infection or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, and 6 patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC). The four study groups did not differ in their mean IL-1 beta responses. However, within the HIV-1-infected patient population, macrophages from 4 patients, 3 of whom had AIDS and 1 with ARC, failed to secrete detectable levels of IL-1 beta. All 4 patients were also nonresponsive in assays for TNF-alpha. These data establish that advanced HIV-1 infection may result in a pronounced dysfunction in the cytokine responses of alveolar macrophages.\r"

The psoralen/UV inactivation procedure described is effective with cells chronically or acutely infected with HIV-1 and is unaffected by cell densities up to 12 x 10(6)/ml. At 5 micrograms/ml psoralen does little damage to cellular permeability as shown by the ability of treated cells to exclude trypan blue and propidium iodide. Psoralen/UV treatment of HIV-1-infected cells does not cause a significant decrease in the reactivity of HIV-1 core and envelope antigens or cellular antigens to monoclonal antibodies. Experiments are presented demonstrating the use of these cells for flow cytometry studies and for cell surface labeling using the lactoperoxidase 125I iodination procedure.\r"

In vivo studies assessed the ability of AlCl3 (10(-1) M, 10(-2) M, 10(-3) M) preincubations to inhibit calcification after 21 and 60 days in the rat subdermal model. Other in vivo studies investigated the ability of other metallic cations (Fe3, La3, and Ga3) used as a pretreatment to inhibit glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium calcification after a 21 day rat subdermal implant. Lyophylized glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium samples were analyzed for Al3 by neutron activation. In vitro results showed the greatest glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium Al3 uptake in specimens incubated in 0.1M AlCl3. Maximal Al3 uptake occurred by 1 hour.

While calcium channel blockade may reduce intradialytic hypotension in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and refractory pulmonary congestion, it is unknown whether such an effect might be seen in unselected hemodialysis patients. Verapamil (40 mg) or a placebo was given 1 hour before hemodialysis to 10 patients in a double-blind crossover study. Two 2 week verapamil periods alternated with two 2 week placebo periods. Patients received bicarbonate for either 3 hours (7 patients, high-flux, Filtral, Gambro-Hospal Inc., Williamsburg, VA) or for 4 hours (3 patients, Travenol 15.11 or CA 110, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL). Left ventricular hypertrophy was present by ultrasound in 7 of 8 patients tested and by electrocardiogram in 1 of the remaining 2. Intradialytic blood pressures were similar during the drug and placebo trials. The number of episodes of symptomatic hypotension per hemodialysis was 0.99 with verapamil and 0.93 during the placebo periods (p less than 0.05). Thus, a single predialysis dosage of verapamil has no effect on intradialytic blood pressure in an unselected hemodialysis population.\r"

Repeated displacement of the disk resulted in a pressure driven flow across the membrane, in addition to the basal delivery obtained because of the concentration difference between the insulin and downstream reservoirs. Augmentation increased nonlinearly with voltage, higher augmentation being achieved at voltages greater than 50 V DC (50% duty cycle). Augmentation was also much greater at frequencies near resonance (e.g., near 200 Hz for a 1.2 microns cellulose acetate membrane) and with smaller insulin reservoirs. Greater augmentations with reasonable basal rates were obtained with membranes that had high diffusive permeabilities and a high ratio of hydraulic to diffusive permeability. Theoretic calculations, using an equivalent circuit model of piezoelectric action, suggested that although the pressure increase in the insulin reservoir was approximately 0.19% of the maximum possible, this pressure increase was sufficient to account for approximately 95% of the augmented flow. Although further improvements are necessary, this device has the potential of delivering insulin to diabetics to better match supply and demand.\r"

A non-compliant Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used as the control. The experimental grafts were 8 mm inside diameter x 25 cm long. Flow experiments were done in a transparent, elastic bench-top flow model; fabrication was based on silicone rubber casts obtained from femoral-to-femoral arteriovenous loop grafts surgically implanted in dogs. The loop graft constructed in the dog model was made to mimic the branchial-to-cephalic angioaccess loop graft commonly used in hemodialysis patients. The flow model was connected to a pulse generator, an adjustable arterial afterload, and a venous afterload. Under identical input conditions, the pressure and flow waveforms were monitored simultaneously at the proximal and distal ends of both the arterial and venous anastomoses. For each graft studied, the anastomotic flow field was visualized using laser illuminated hydrogen bubbles as tracers. At pulse rates of 60 and 90 beats/min, graft flow rates were 2.2 and 2.5 L/min, respectively. Among the grafts studied, measurable differences in pressure and flow wave attenuation and their respective phase lags resulted in characteristically dissimilar flow patterns at the venous anastomosis. Growth of the separation zone at the toe of the anastomosis, and the pattern of retrograde flow in the distal vein are visibly different in all three grafts.\r"

Computed tomographic peritoneography was found to be superior to computed tomography scans in localizing small leak sites. In seven of nine patients with clinically diagnosed dialysate leakage, computed tomographic peritoneography supported the clinical diagnosis and localized the leak site in six patients. All patients with a conspicuous leak site and/or with leaks through hernias had to have surgical treatment. Computed tomographic peritoneography failed to reveal a leak or identify a fluid tract in patients with intermittent, small leaks. Those leaks responded easily to a dialysis regimen with diminished intraabdominal pressure. Normal intraperitoneal fluid distribution was based on 17 studies after intraperitoneal infusion of 2,000 ml of peritoneal dialysis solution in patients without intraabdominal organomegaly and/or any clinical suspicion of fluid maldistribution, with average peritoneal transport characteristics. As appraised in the supine position, approximate fluid contents in the intraperitoneal spaces were pelvis, 30-55%; paracolic gutter, 15-30%; perisplenic and perihepatic, 10-20% each, and lesser sac, 1-3%. Severe fluid maldistribution on computed tomography peritoneography, particularly a small fluid volume in the pelvic space, is a poor prognostic sign as to the feasibility of peritoneal dialysis; neither of our two patients with no fluid in the pelvic space could be maintained on peritoneal dialysis, while patients with no fluid in the lesser sac, perihepatic and perisplenic spaces could be maintained on peritoneal dialysis. No fluid was seen in the peritoneal cavity after drainage in the vertical position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling was performed in 160 women. The aim was to assess patient acceptance of the procedure when performed under para-cervical block. The most common indication was abnormal uterine bleeding. In 152 patients the procedure was successful, allowing thorough inspection of the uterine cavity, and in almost half of them no abnormality was detected. Thirty-one required subsequent elective admission, mainly for fibroid polypectomy. In most women the level of discomfort was assessed as 'tolerable', but in two the procedure was abandoned because of severe discomfort. Endometrial carcinoma was detected in six patients. There were no complications attributable to the procedure. Outpatient hysteroscopy considerably reduces the need for hospital admission and can provide early investigation for patients with a spectrum of gynaecological disorders, at low cost and with minimal facilities.\r"

  ".U": "90254070\r", 
  ".W": "During a 1-year period all women entering hospital with signs or symptoms that could herald preterm delivery were studied. The primary complaints of these 178 women were contractions in 70, watery discharge in 59, bloody discharge in 33, and abdominal pain in 16. These complaints were considered as confirmed threats of preterm delivery if the woman was delivered or received tocolysis within 48 h (n = 63; 35%); they were labelled as an unconfirmed threat if the woman was allowed to return home without further action within 48 h (n = 45; 25%). Overall, 75% of the women were correct in their estimation that something was wrong in that they either gave birth or were admitted for greater than 48 h for diagnostic or therapeutic measures. Parity had only a small influence on women's predictive ability. It is concluded that efforts to increase women's awareness of the significance of various symptoms are not likely to contribute much to improvement in the early diagnosis of preterm labour. Greater effect can be anticipated from the development of methods to differentiate between contractions that will or will not lead to early delivery.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the rapid, small pulses vary during the ovarian cycle, 16 normal women were studied on two occasions each, in the early and late follicular phases of one cycle or the luteal and following early follicular phase. Blood samples were taken every 1 min for 1 h. Statistical methods of time series analysis were applied to the data. There were significant amplitude differences between subjects at all stages of the cycle. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that the frequency of the small rapid pulses varied during folliculogenesis. The results for the luteal phase, while less uniform, showed no consistent change. It is suggested that the rapid pulses may be related to function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis rather than direct ovarian control.\r"

In an attempt to minimize this complication a temporary indwelling cervical support stent has been developed. This is sutured into the exposed cone bed immediately after cutting the cone specimen and removed 2 weeks later. A pilot study using this device in 33 cold knife conizations has been performed. There were no primary or secondary haemorrhages and no post-conization pelvic infections. At follow-up, 6 months after cone biopsy two patients (6%) had clinical cervical stenosis, and one patient (3%) complained of dysmenorrhoea (although the cervix was not stenosed). The cervical transformation zone was fully visible in 21/33 patients (64%) (95% CI 48 to 80) and follow-up smears contained endocervical cells in 20/33 patients (61%) (95% CI 44 to 78). These results compare very favourably with historical controls from the same unit and suggest that cone biopsy support stents should now be assessed in a prospective randomized trial.\r"

Two different shapes of sapphire probes were used. The specific laser properties and the application of vasopressin enabled treatment without any other incision instruments or coagulation agents. In one patient subsequent laparoscopy became necessary due to persisting trophoblastic tissue. Sixteen women were assessed subsequently by second-look laparoscopy or hysterosalpingography for tubal patency and possible formation of adhesions. In 14 (88%) women the tubes were patent, and in two women adhesions were seen.\r"

About six months after radiotherapy, patients who remained disease free returned to pretreatment levels of suppressor cell activity and later showed even lewer levels of suppression. On the other hand, patients who developed recurrent disease maintained sustained high levels of suppression and for all stages they always had higher suppressor activity than the patients who remained disease free in the corresponding stage. These results stress the importance of a possible deranged immune system in these patients and also shows the clinical and prognostic significance of the assay.\r"

Grading was performed on 50 prostatectomy specimens by 5 pathologists. The results were averaged so as to reduce the impact of inter-observer variation. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the relationship between average grading scores and both time-to-recurrence and time-to-death by prostatic carcinoma. Age at surgery was considered to be a possible confounding factor and adjusted accordingly. The prognostic impact of the 5 grading systems (related to both recurrence and death caused by prostatic carcinoma) was judged by the likelihood ratio (LR) test score (chi 2 distributed with 1 df); for time-to-recurrence for the Mostofi-Schroeder score the LR was 6.54 and for the Gleason system it was 1.79. A stepwise procedure demonstrated that the best prognostic performance was reached with the Mostofi-Schroeder and Broders systems used together (with Mostofi-Schroeder weighted 1.5 times larger than Broders). For time-to-recurrence the median grading result was also used, giving results similar to the mean grading result. For time-to-death from prostatic carcinoma the LR test scores for all grading systems were relatively low. In this analysis the outcome of the Gleason system showed a minimum of prognostic ability, whereas the Broders and Mostofi-Schroeder systems had a reasonable predictive ability. Since the inter-observer variation of the Mostofi-Schroeder system was large, the Broders system is preferable. The restrictions and implications of this study are discussed and a brief review of the prognostic importance of grading of prostatic carcinoma is presented.\r"

  ".U": "90254355\r", 
  ".W": "We present 8 years' experience of primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RLND) in 190 patients with low stage non-seminoma; 154 patients had clinical stage I (CSI) and 36 had clinical stage IIa (CSIIa) disease. Of the 154 patients with CSI tumours, 33 had increased serum AFP and/or HCG before RLND (CSIM+) and 121 had normal tumour markers (CSIM-). Retroperitoneal lymph node metastases (pathological stage II) (PSII) were found in 38 of 121 patients with CSIM-, in 19 of 33 patients with CSIIM+ and in 26 of 36 patients with CSIIa. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of small vessel infiltration (demonstrated in histological sections of the primary tumour) and a prolonged tumour marker half-life were predictive factors for PSII. These 2 factors enabled a group of non-seminoma patients with CSI disease to be identified who had a 15% risk of retroperitoneal tumour growth (low risk group) as compared with a high risk group where 60 to 70% of patients had retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Relapses occurred in 7 of 107 patients with PSI and in 6 of 83 patients with PSII disease; in the latter group, 5 relapses developed before the start of routine adjuvant chemotherapy; 6% of patients developed major post-operative complications. In addition, \"dry ejaculation\" was the principal side effect following RLND (unilateral RLND: 20/132 patients; bilateral RLND: 50/54 patients). The comparative cost to the health service during the first year of follow-up was estimated for low risk non-seminoma patients with CSI subjected to RLND and for those in whom a surveillance policy was adopted. The latter approach was preferable. It was concluded that a surveillance policy should be followed in low risk non-seminoma CSI patients provided that frequent follow-up is possible. A more active policy is recommended in high risk patients (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy without RLND). Nerve-sparing RLND may be considered in patients with CSIIa disease and negative tumour markers.\r"

However, when patients do not achieve full erection on the test, it is necessary to differentiate between insufficient inflow and excessive outflow. Gravity cavernosometry is a method designed to evaluate the pressure responses in the corpora when they are subjected to a constant infusion pressure. The infusion flow is of minor significance. The intracavernous pressure (ICP) was measured in cadavers, in psychogenically impotent patients and in patients with arteriogenic impotence, following administration of papaverine and gravity perfusion. During perfusion in cadavers and in psychogenic patients, the ICP showed values above 110 cm H2O, while in arteriogenic patients the values ranged from 30 to 141 cm H2O. In the arteriogenic group, 11/20 patients had an ICP lower than 110 during perfusion. There was no correlation between the pre-perfusion pressure and the final pressure with perfusion. Gravity cavernosometry is a simple, cost-effective and reliable method for the assessment of corporeal competence.\r"

  ".W": "Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained by concentric needle electrodes from the bulbocavernosus (BC) and ischiocavernosus (IC) muscles in 7 human volunteers during excitement to erection and subsequent ejaculation. Simultaneous registration of the time course and volume of each expressed spurt of semen was obtained using an aluminium pan suspended in front of the subject's penis on a force transducer the output of which was charted with the EMG activity. The BC and IC muscles showed no EMG activity during erection and detumescence cycles induced by visual sex stimulation. In 5 of 7 subjects, the first EMG burst of the BC in ejaculations induced by masturbation was not correlated with an expelled spurt of semen as were subsequent bursts. However, only 26 to 60% of the total number of EMG bursts were accompanied by expulsion of a spurt of semen. There thus appears to be a large safety factor in the striated muscle expulsive mechanism. Oral phenoxybenzamine treatment in 2 subjects did not significantly affect either the number of EMG bursts of the BC or the subjective pleasure of the orgasm but did significantly reduce the volume of semen expelled. Semen volume does not appear to be a unique determinant of the pleasure felt or the trigger for ejaculation.\r"

However, until the benefits of the new analysis are more widely recognized (and it is hoped that this paper is a step towards that goal), it is argued that it is useful to present both analyses in such comparisons of measurement techniques.\r"

Mice from the first group were allocated into two groups. Mice from the first group were allocated into four subgroups to receive 6 days intraperitoneal (I.P.) injections as follows: (i) recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) (250 units day-1); (ii) saline; (iii) indomethacin (5 micrograms-1 day-1); or (iv) rhIL-2 (250 units) + indomethacin (5 micrograms). Sham burned mice served as no treatment controls. All animals were subjected to peritonitis induced by caecal ligation and puncture 10 days after the burn and mortality was assessed. Mice from the second group were allocated to two subgroups to receive 6 days intraperitoneal injections of: (i) rhIL-2 + indomethacin; or (ii) saline. Animals in this group did not undergo septic challenge. They were randomly killed on days 7, 9 or 10 after the burn. Their splenocytes were harvested and assayed for response to the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A), and for production of interleukin 2. Mortality rate in animals subjected to burn and septic challenge without treatment was 75 per cent; in mice receiving rhIL-2 alone it was 68 per cent, in mice receiving indomethacin alone it was 62 per cent (no significance) and in mice receiving rhIL-2 + indomethacin it was reduced to 38 per cent (P less than 0.02). Splenocytes from animals receiving combination therapy had markedly improved responses to PHA on days 7 (P = 0.01), 9 (P = 0.02), and 10 (P = 0.008), and to Con A on days 7 (P = 0.001), 9 (P = 0.002) and 10 (P = 0.001), after burn injury. Interleukin 2 production was also significantly (P = 0.004) improved by therapy with rhIL-2 + indomethacin. These data suggest that low dose rhIL-2 in combination with indomethacin may have potential use in the therapy of burn victims.\r"

Gastric peak acid output in normal volunteers ranged from 6.9 to 22.1 mmol/h. All asymptomatic patients after vagotomy had a peak acid output less than 7 mmol/h, consistent with complete vagotomy. Five patients with recurrent ulcer had a peak acid output greater than 8 mmol/h, suggesting an incomplete vagotomy. Urine acid output after a test meal, expressed as the change from the basal rate of acid output, was always in a negative direction in normal subjects (fall in acid output = postprandial alkaline tide). This change was abolished in patients with complete vagotomy, in whom urine acid output increased after a meal. In five patients with incomplete vagotomy (and one other with recurrent ulcer and unknown vagal status) the urine acid output changed in a negative direction after a test meal. The relationship of urine acid output to gastric secretion was confirmed by the abolition of the postprandial alkaline tide in normal subjects given ranitidine. The results in patients with incomplete vagotomy did not overlap with those from patients with complete vagotomy. This suggests that this test could be used for the routine postoperative assessment of completeness of vagotomy.\r"

Obstruction of the pouch or its conduit by recurrent tumour was not observed in any patient, including those who died from metastatic disease. There was one instance of benign stenosis of the distal anastomosis to the duodenum which required revisional surgery.

  ".W": "The continuous 99mTc-HIDA infusion test is presented as a method for measuring duodenogastric reflux as well as for studying biliary elimination of the compound when it is administered by constant intravenous infusion. Thirty patients were studied: (a) ten patients with a T tube placed in the biliary tree were used to study the elimination of 99mTc-HIDA in the bile; (b) ten normal subjects were used as a control group; and (c) ten patients were studied who had undergone Billroth I gastrectomy for peptic ulceration. Studies of subjects in groups (b) and (c) were used to assess duodenogastric reflux by this test, correlating it with the measurement of bile acids in gastric juice. When 99mTc-HIDA was administered by constant intravenous infusion it resulted in an increased elimination in bile for the first 80-100 min, and the concentration in bile then remained relatively constant for the rest of the test. With respect to the duodenogastric reflux study group, reflux rates in the patients who had been operated on were higher than those in the control group, with statistically significant differences. Minimum reflux rates were found in the normal subjects. Assessment of reflux by 99mTc-HIDA correlated closely with the results of bile acid concentrations in Billroth I patients (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001) and control subjects (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001). Our results demonstrate that continuous 99mTc-HIDA perfusion is a useful, accurate and objective method for measuring duodenogastric reflux.\r"

The amount of reflux (areas of pH greater than 4) in the type 1 gastric ulcer and Billroth I and Billroth II groups was significantly greater than that found in the control, duodenal ulcer, type 3 gastric ulcer and truncal vagotomy plus pyloroplasty groups. The mean concentration of total bile acids was also greater in the gastrectomized patients than in the rest of the groups studied.

Generalized Wilcoxon estimates for 5-year survival rate were 47.1 per cent for patients exhibiting serosal invasion and 75.9 per cent for patients without serosal invasion. The frequency of lymph node metastasis increased proportionately with the extent of serosal invasion: 18.4 per cent in cases of S0; 53.8 per cent in cases of S1; 80.0 per cent in cases of S2; and 91.4 per cent in cases of S3. The higher the aggregate total of S (serosal invasion) and n (lymph node metastasis) factors, the lower the 5-year survival rate. In addition, patients with serosal invasion had a propensity for peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells; the percentage of cases with intraperitoneal free cancer cells increased with the extent of serosal invasion. It is worth noting that when cancer infiltration proceeded to the deeper layers and was accompanied by nodal metastasis, cancerous invasion of the perinodal fatty tissue was frequently evident. Therefore, unfavourable prognosis after curative resection in gastric cancer patients with serosal invasion may be largely dependent on whether or not the cancer has invaded the peritoneal cavity and the perinodal fatty tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Wound healing was studied in 95 jaundiced patients and 123 anicteric patients using skin prolylhydroxylase activity as an index of collagen synthesis. The mean (s.d.) value of skin prolylhydroxylase activity in jaundiced patients was significantly lower than that of controls in the preoperative period (40.1(19.2) versus 369.2(32.2) c.p.m./mg protein, respectively, P less than 0.001). Before operation there was a significant difference between patients with benign or malignant obstruction of the biliary tree (55.0(12.3) versus 25.2(10.4) c.p.m./mg protein, respectively, P less than 0.05). In patients with benign obstruction skin prolylhydroxylase activity returned to normal values (326.3(53.1) c.p.m./mg protein, P less than 0.001 versus preoperative values), while in patients with malignant lesions skin prolylhydroxylase activity increased significantly with respect to the preoperative period (25.2(10.4) versus 82.9(14.3) c.p.m./mg protein, P less than 0.01) but was still below normal values. Abdominal wound dehiscence was more common in jaundiced patients (six of 95) than in the anicteric group (two of 123). This complication appeared to be associated with a low skin prolylhydroxylase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1 January 1980 and 31 July 1988, 62 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were splenectomized for splenomegaly and presumed hypersplenism. All patients except one had splenomegaly (mean (s.d.) weight 1585(872) g, range 150-4300 g) and 34 had massive splenomegaly (greater than 1500 g). Forty-nine patients had platelet counts less than 100 x 10(9)/l and 16 patients had anaemia with haemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dl. White cell counts were less than 3 x 10(9)/l in six NHL patients. Fifteen patients had bicytopenia, and three NHL patients had tricytopenia. The selected group of 62 patients underwent splenectomy largely because of failure to respond to medical therapy (39 patients) or inability to tolerate or start adequate chemotherapy because of very low blood counts (11 patients). There was one postoperative death, and a 29 per cent morbidity rate. The response rate was 89 per cent in the first month after splenectomy and 39 patients (63 per cent) had a continuing complete response with a median follow-up of 26 months (range 3-96 months). Twelve patients (10 with CLL) received no further therapy after splenectomy. Seven patients failed to respond and 15 relapsed after splenectomy. These 22 patients could be distinguished on the basis of: (1) lower average preoperative platelet counts (P less than 0.007), postoperative platelet counts (P less than 0.001), and postoperative rise in platelets (P less than 0.004); (2) lower average spleen weight (P less than 0.052); (3) preoperative chemotherapy (P less than 0.044). However preoperative and postoperative platelet counts were the only two variables selected by stepwise regression analysis (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Bone marrow failure did not preclude complete response after splenectomy. Long-term survivors emerged from the group of patients with continuing complete response. Of the seven patients who failed to respond, five died with a median survival of 4 months, and of the 15 patients who relapsed after splenectomy, 13 died, with a median survival of 6 months after relapse and 18 months after splenectomy. Thus, splenectomy may be an effective palliation for both CLL and NHL patients with splenomegaly and hypersplenism.\r"

  ".W": "The contrasting results of treatment of patients with postoperative enterocutaneous fistulae reflect the heterogeneity of the disease and depend on the patient's condition and the characteristics of the fistulae. For this reason, the use of a prognostic index, which enables such patients to be classified according to their risk of death, could be useful. In this study we propose a prognostic index based on a logistic regression analysis, obtained by using two (APACHE II score and serum albumin concentration) of the eight risk factors that have been retrospectively analysed in a series of 70 patients with postoperative enterocutaneous fistulae treated in our surgical department since 1981. The logistic regression equation indicates that patients with a probability of dying of less than 0.35 have a good prognosis, with a sensitivity of 90 per cent, a specificity of 90 per cent, a negative predictive value of 79 per cent, a positive predictive value of 96 per cent and an accuracy of 90 per cent. The predictive performance of the index has also been evaluated in a group of 17 patients studied prospectively, and this confirms the sensitivity and specificity of the model. This postoperative enterocutaneous fistulae index could be a helpful tool in clinical trials and surgical audit.\r"

  ".W": "Blood flow patterns have been studied in 28 patients with soft tissue sarcoma (29 tumours) using 99mTc-labelled hexamethyl propyleneamineoxime with planar views of the tumour-bearing region. Tumour:background ratios ranged from 1.13 to 6.60 (mean 2.74) and maximum:minimum tumour ratios (between peripheries and centres of tumours) ranged from 1.34 to 32.0 (mean 4.70). In eight of 29 tumours (seven of which were involving the trunk) the tumour could not be identified. This study demonstrates that the blood supply to soft tissue sarcomas is generally greater than that to adjacent normal tissues and that tumour centres are relatively underperfused compared with the tumour periphery. In this heterogeneous series there was no clear-cut relationship between blood flow and histological grade or type.\r"

  ".W": "Anorectal manometry and electrophysiology studies were conducted in 25 men with non-prolapsing haemorrhoids, ten men with prolapsing haemorrhoids, and 20 age-matched normal men. Mean(s.e.m.) minimum basal pressures were significantly higher in patients with non-prolapsing haemorrhoids than in normals (61(5) versus 43(7) cmH2O; P less than 0.05) or patients with prolapsing haemorrhoids (55(4) cmH2O; P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in maximum basal pressures and maximum squeeze pressures. During rectal distension, all normal subjects showed relaxation in all anal channels. However, 92 per cent of patients with non-prolapsing haemorrhoids and 40 per cent of patients with prolapsing haemorrhoids showed no relaxation in the outer anal channels, even when relaxation occurred in the inner anal channels; internal sphincter electrical slow waves were suppressed and the integrated electrical activity of the external sphincter had returned to predistension values. Maximum residual anal pressures during balloon distension were significantly higher in patients with non-prolapsing haemorrhoids than normals (75(7) versus 45(7) cmH2O; P less than 0.01), or patients with prolapsing haemorrhoids (53(3) cmH2O; P less than 0.05). When subjects increased intra-abdominal pressure rectal pressure was significantly higher in patients with non-prolapsing haemorrhoids than in normal subjects (157(10) versus 105(15) cmH2O; P less than 0.05), but not in patients with prolapsing haemorrhoids (126(14) cmH2O). Resting anal cushion pressures in patients with non-prolapsing or prolapsing haemorrhoids were much higher than normal capillary or venous pressure and significantly higher than those recorded in normals (median 35, 35 versus 10 cmH2O; P less than 0.0001). Pressures recorded during coughing (60, 60 versus 30 cmH2O) and straining (78, 80 versus 55 cmH2O) were also significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) in patients than in normals. Pressures after straining were higher than those recorded before (38 versus 29 cmH2O; P less than 0.05) in 60 per cent of patients but no normal subjects and took 18-36 s to return to baseline. This study suggests that the abnormally high pressures in the anal canal in patients with haemorrhoids may be related to an increased vascular pressure in the anal cushions.\r"

A solution is a comprehensive set of leaflets covering 65 different general surgical operations. The leaflets describe the illness, operation, exact management regimen, some complications and outlook, in a deliberately simple style. Master copies are stored on a wordprocessor to allow unlimited expansion and updating. A retrospective survey of 200 patients showed that those receiving leaflets were significantly more satisfied with information (72 per cent overall) than those not receiving leaflets (42 per cent overall) (P less than 0.01). This was especially apparent for information about postoperative progress, both in hospital (92 per cent versus 52 per cent) and after discharge from hospital (88 per cent versus 39 per cent). The system is effective, cheap and popular with patients and medical and nursing staff. The wordprocessor allows extensive modifications of the information to suit other surgeons' requirements.\r"
