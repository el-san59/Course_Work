  ".W": "Considerable experimental evidence is in support of several aspects of the mechanism that has been proposed for the catalytic activity of lysozyme. However, the enzymatically catalyzed hydrolysis of polysaccharides proceeds over 5 orders of magnitude faster than that of model compounds that mimic the configuration of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme. Although several possible explanations for this rate enhancement have been discussed elsewhere, a definitive mechanism has not emerged. Here we report striking results obtained by classical electrodynamics, which suggest that bond breakage and the consequent separation of charge in lysozyme is promoted by a large electrostatic field across the active site cleft, produced in part by a very asymmetric distribution of charged residues on the enzyme surface. Lysozymes unrelated in amino acid sequence have similar distributions of charged residues and electric fields. The results reported here suggest that the electrostatic component of the rate enhancement is greater than 9 kcal.mol-1. Thus, electrostatic interactions may play a more important role in the enzymatic mechanism than has generally been appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations in the ninaA gene of Drosophila severely reduce the amount of rhodopsin specifically in R1-6 photoreceptors. Isolation of the ninaA gene by chromosomal walking revealed that it is expressed only in the eye and encodes a 237-amino acid polypeptide that shows strong sequence similarity to cyclophilin, a putative molecular target for cyclosporine A, a potent immunosuppressant used in human organ transplantations. Unlike most cyclophilins characterized to date, the ninaA-encoded protein has a putative signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. Each of the three ehtyl methanesulfonate-induced ninaA mutant alleles analyzed shows a single nucleotide change in the mRNA coding region leading to either a nonsense or a missense mutation. We find no evidence that the ninaA-encoded protein is directly involved in phototransduction. The only detectable mutant phenotype that correlates with the severity of molecular defects in the three mutants is the amount of depletion of R1-6 rhodopsin. The above results and the recent findings that cyclophilin is a peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase suggest that the ninaA-encoded protein may be required for proper folding and stability of R1-6 rhodopsin.\r"

In this report the development of a highly regulated expression system in mammalian cells is described in which transcription of a foreign gene is mediated by the bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase under the control of the Escherichia coli lac repressor. Rabbit kidney cell lines have been established that constitutively express the phage RNA polymerase and lac repressor. The two bacterial proteins regulate the transcription of the coding sequence of the firefly luciferase, which has been placed under the control of a T3 promoter/lac operator fusion. In the presence of the inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside, efficient T3 polymerase-dependent transcription is observed, which is tightly repressed in the absence of inducer. Translation of the T3 transcripts can be mediated by vaccinia virus functions. The demonstration that a specific transcription activity can be regulated over a range of several orders of magnitude in higher eukaryotic cells by using a highly specific and nontoxic inducer has broad implications for a variety of studies.\r"

Primary endothelial cells and hepatoma cells were not recognized by either group of antibodies. Through indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, the Saos-2-specific antigen was demonstrated to reside on the surface of these osteosarcoma cells. Metabolic radiolabeling of cultured Saos-2 cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic separation, and autoradiography revealed this protein to have a Mr of 80,000. Similar experiments in the presence of hormones showed that the expression of this cell surface protein was influenced in an opposing fashion by the bone-regulating hormones parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. Vitamin D stimulated expression by 300%, whereas parathyroid hormone depressed expression by 50%. Thus, Saos-2 human osteoblastic cells demonstrate hormonal regulation through an apparently specific membrane protein.\r"

Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies directed against two regions of murine erythroid band 3 gave a pattern of basolateral labeling similar to that seen with antibodies directed against the entire protein. In the medullary collecting duct almost all intercalated cells expressed basolateral membrane band 3 and displayed apical membrane H+-ATPase. In the cortical collecting duct and the connecting segment, band 3 labeling was restricted to a subpopulation of intercalcated cells. In the cortical collecting duct 46% of intercalated cells had apical H+-ATPase and basolateral band 3. Cells that had either basolateral or diffuse cytoplasmic staining for H+-ATPase were all band 3-negative and accounted for 53% of the intercalated cells. In addition, occasional intercalated cells with apical H+-ATPase appeared to lack basolateral band 3. These results demonstrate the coexpression of H+-ATPase and band 3 in opposite plasma membrane domains of a subpopulation of intercalated cells that are probably the acid-excreting (type A) cells. All other intercalated cells lacked immunoreactive band 3 and probably include the bicarbonate-excreting (type B) cells.\r"

When most cells of compacted eight-cell embryos were injected with the GJ antisense RNA, 20% of the embryos were decompacted and only 5% had developed to the blastocyst stage at 90 hr, when blastulation had occurred in 90% of the control embryos. When antisense RNA was injected in one blastomere of four-cell embryos, 40% of the embryos presented a large cell that was not included in the compacted embryo at the time of compaction, and an additional 30% of the embryos had two smaller, excluded blastomeres. These excluded cells were identified as the injected cell with a rhodamine-conjugated dextran marker. To assess effects on junctional communication, one blastomere of some embryos was injected with Lucifer yellow, a GJ-penetrating dye, at various times after a blastomere was injected with antisense RNA. The dye was visible in the whole cell mass of control embryos, but it was excluded from a portion of experimental embryos when the delay between the RNA and the Lucifer yellow injections was 1 hr or longer.\r"

Tum function, encoded near the right-hand end of the coliphage 186 chromosome, is under the control of promoter p95. This promoter is overlapped by a sequence closely related to the consensus sequence of the LexA-binding site. It is proposed that inactivation of LexA after UV irradiation (or by genetic means) leads to prophage induction by permitting expression of Tum which, by unknown means, induces prophage. This mechanism is basically different from that seen with the UV-inducible lambdoid coliphages, which are not regulated by LexA.\r"

Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analyses performed on samples from two donors revealed the presence of a single class of high-affinity IL-3 binding sites (500 and 2100 sites per cell; dissociation constant at equilibrium, 230 and 160 pmol/liter, respectively). Purified CML basophils maintained in suspension in the presence of rhIL-3 (100 units/ml) incorporated up to 12 times more [3H]thymidine than basophils in control cultures. Furthermore, after preincubation in vitro with rhIL-3 (100 units/ml) for 30 min, normal blood basophils released 2- to 3-fold more histamine than basophils pretreated with control medium when exposed to various concentrations of an anti-IgE antibody. Together, these results show that rhIL-3 binds to a specific receptor on blood basophils and is a regulator of basophil function.\r"

  ".U": "89315837\r", 
  ".W": "A cDNA clone homologous to the mouse lymph node homing receptor core protein (mLHRc) was isolated from a cDNA library derived from stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Human RNA blot analysis shows a tissue and cell-line distribution of transcript expression generally parallel to that seen in the mouse, with expression confined to lymphoid tissues and some cell lines. Genomic DNA analysis suggests a low-copy gene under high-stringency conditions. The complete nucleotide sequence predicts a mature protein of 334 amino acids, identical in length to mLHRc. The protein shows striking conservation globally between human and mouse sequences. In particular, all three genre of protein interaction domains identified in the mouse--an animal lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and two homologous repeat units preserving the motif of complement regulatory proteins (CRP)--are present in the human protein (hLHRc), and maintain the same tandem arrangement. The lectin and EGF-like regions are the most homologous, while the CRP domains are less conserved between species. The two CRP units in hLHRc are distinct from those in mLHRc in that they are homologous to one another rather than identical, suggesting strong pressure for maintenance of two repeats in this molecule. hLHRc is distinct from other kinds of lymphocyte adhesion molecules represented by VLA-4 (integrin) or CD44/gp90Hermes and, together with mLHRc and two other recently described molecules having a similar domain motif, defines a novel class of adhesion molecules exhibiting distinct evolutionary features. We propose that hLHRc likely represents the protein core of the human homologue of mLHRc functionally as well as structurally.\r"

Exposure of human malignant keratinocytes to these oligo(dN)s significantly attenuated the level of cytoplasmic cRBP and hnRAR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Further, the induction of alkaline phosphatase by retinol in these cells was blocked by treatment with 30 microM antisense oligo(dN) to cRBP or hnRAR but not by 30 microM of sense oligo(dN) to cRBP. Antisense oligo(dN) treatments concomitantly induced cell rounding, loss of cell-cell attachment, and cell adhesion to the substratum. By contrast, treatment of cells with an anticytokinetic agent, cytochalasin B, or with a cytostatic concentration of sodium azide failed to reduce cytoplasmic cRBP or hnRAR from nuclear extracts, even though antisense oligo(dN)-like changes in cell morphology were observed. Treatment of the cells for greater than 2.75 hr with 20-40 microM of either antisense oligo(dN) also led to the loss of clonogenic potential. These results show that both cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors for retinoids are important in the transduction of a retinoid signal response critical to cellular growth and differentiation. Our findings also suggest that defined genes, which are specified by retinoids and their receptors, may account for the pleiotropic effect of vitamin A compounds.\r"

These diarylguanidines also protected rat hippocampal neurons in vitro from glutamate-induced cell death. Our results show that some diarylguanidines are noncompetitive antagonists of NMDA receptor-mediated responses and have the neuroprotective property that is commonly associated with blockers of the NMDA receptor-gated cation channel. Diarylguanidines are structurally unrelated to known blockers of NMDA channels and, therefore, represent a new compound series for the development of neuroprotective agents with therapeutic value in patients suffering from stroke, from brain or spinal cord trauma, from hypoglycemia, and possibly from brain ischemia due to heart attack.\r"

Three patients were seen with significant anatomic deficits and functional debilitations resulting from large composite mandibulectomies for oral carcinoma. Each patient underwent reestablishment of the mandibular arch with a vascularized iliac crest bone graft. Following complete healing, the dental arch was replaced with a fixed prosthesis by the technique of osseointegration. The creation of a fixed osseodental unit has allowed each of these individuals to return to a state of anatomic, functional, psychological, and social good health.

Current delivery was discontinued 4 days postoperatively. Quantitative assessment at 7 days postoperatively indicated the presence of necrotic skin over 80 to 90 percent of the graft surface area in NC and CT animals. In contrast, only 50 percent of the graft area was necrotic in AT rats. Histologic examinations indicated a significantly thickened dermis in the AT (versus NC and CT) rats, accompanied by patches of multilayered intact epidermis, which was virtually absent from the other experimental groups. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that direct-current stimulation can affect skin graft survival and repair.\r"

After flap creation, one observes through the microscope that at 1 hour a large area of tissue is nonperfused as a result of the surgical trauma. This is followed by vasodilatation at 6 hours, resulting in an increase in the area of perfused tissue. At 24 hours, the vasodilatation persists, and the red cells that have entered the tissue during the vasodilatation (6 hours) accumulate in the capillaries, this being reflected by an increased area of nonperfused tissue. This increase continues to 72 hours, at which time the perfusion-nonperfusion interface becomes well defined and remains so throughout the 5-day experiment. Analyses of the relationship between early postoperative capillary perfusion and eventual necrosis are presented. Advantages and disadvantages of this model are listed.\r"

Although the complexity of functional assessment instruments can be intimidating to clinicians, the principles behind instruments of functional assessment are quite familiar. Physicians already are doing a significant amount of this performance assessment, though frequently it is not labeled as such. Table 8 provides a summary of these performance functional assessments that are easily accomplished in an ambulatory setting and applicable to the hospital or long-term care setting. The direct observation of these elements, combined with the selection of an appropriate assessment instrument for functional assessment, should allow for enhanced patient assessment and better application of the biopsychosocial model of medical care into practice to benefit the future care of our geriatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "Improvements in anesthesia and surgical techniques have greatly reduced the perioperative mortality and morbidity of elderly patients. Mortality is more closely correlated with pathology, type of surgery, and duration of anesthesia rather than with age. Particular attention should be directed toward cardiac and pulmonary status, because operative mortality and morbidity is related, for the most part, to cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. Postoperatively, the occurrence of pulmonary emboli and painless myocardial infarctions is more common in this age group. Elderly patients are more often confused postoperatively owing to the residual effect of anesthetics, analgesics, fever, and electrolyte disturbances. The stress of surgery and unfamiliar surroundings are also frequent precipitating causes. Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse readings should be checked before ambulating elderly patients who have been at bed rest for more than 2 to 3 days because of the frequent occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. Pressure sores, incontinence, and aspiration pneumonia may also occur owing to immobility. The elderly patient's functional status and mental status may be enhanced by simple encouragement, early mobilization, and by social interaction. It is not possible to precisely define the risks of proposed procedure, nor can the physician eliminate all risks from a surgical procedure. The risks a particular patient is subjected to depend on the complex interplay of the preoperative medical condition of the patient, the type of surgery proposed, and the skill and expertise of the anesthesiologist and surgeon. We must strive to achieve the goal of bringing our patient to the operating room in the best possible condition in the time available.\r"

The diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and the ACE inhibitors are very effective and generally well-tolerated therapy for the elderly. It may be necessary to combine two of these agents for some patients. Beta blockers are particularly useful for patients with ischemic heart disease or prior myocardial infarction. Beta blockers are the only agents which have been shown to be cardioprotective. For all antihypertensive agents, the elderly should be started on low doses. The drugs should then be titrated slowly if necessary. It is common for the elderly to respond to lower dosages than younger patients, and they should be monitored carefully for adverse reactions to medications. Antihypertensives should be administered once or twice daily whenever possible. If these principles are considered, most patients can be effectively controlled with a minimum of side effects.\r"

There is every reason to believe from early reports that the elderly respond favorably to treatment, perhaps more so than their younger counterparts. It is believed that treating chemical dependency as a primary disease rather than as a symptom of something else has been a great boon in terms of improving recovery rates. Furthermore, group therapy is the main component of treatment in rehabilitation, as it affords the greatest opportunity to shift the dependence on chemical to a dependence on human beings. The physician is in a key position to help the elderly, because so many elderly need and use medical care. Intervention is highly recommended if the doctor is knowledgeable and skilled in this area and is willing to kindly confront the patient with a somewhat undesirable diagnosis. Rehabilitation regimens are becoming more plentiful throughout the country. If services are unavailable, however, there is always AA to fall back on or to recommend initially. Remember, fully one third of all AA members are older than 50 and that it is a source of acceptance, support, and an opportunity to depend on human beings instead of psychoactive chemicals. Remember too that few patients with addiction recover by themselves. It is worth remembering that this is an incurable disease in that once addicted, it is unlikely that anyone can ever use socially psychoactive chemical substances again. Use of psychoactive chemicals is fraught with danger for the physician and the patient and indeed may place the physician at risk for malpractice. There is great satisfaction to be gained from helping those afflicted with alcoholism and other drug dependencies. The gratitude displayed by those receiving help for this affliction is truly remarkable and one that will leave the clinician with a sense of \"a job well done.\"\r"

The first step in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in the elderly should involve nonpharmacologic measures. This should include the exclusion of medication-induced dementia and delirium, which is an important consideration in the elderly owing to multiple medication use and alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Other measures involve relatively simple environmental changes. If these are unsuccessful, pharmacologic management is often tried. Numerous concerns surround the use of antipsychotics, which are the primary agents used to treat behavioral symptoms in demented elderly. The public is concerned about their inappropriate use as chemical restraints. Another concern involves the efficacy of these agents. Most well-designed studies demonstrate an overall modest effect from the antipsychotics that is often similar to that seen with placebo. There may be a small number of patients who respond markedly, whereas the majority do not receive great benefit. Unfortunately, all are exposed to the numerous side effects of these agents, including some irreversible movement disorders. If these agents are believed to be necessary, efforts should be made to use them in a manner that reduces the associated risks. A few other agents have been noted to successfully treat the problem behaviors associated with dementia, but most have been in the form of case reports. It appears that the optimal treatment of these problems relies on future research in the area of nonantipsychotic modalities that will be efficacious and have a rather benign side effect profile.\r"

  ".W": "Primary care physicians have a vital role to play in identifying depression in their elderly patients. Diagnosis may be difficult, because symptoms are atypical and frequently include psychomotor agitation, somatic symptoms, and complaints of memory loss. Patients with medical illnesses, such as cancer, postmyocardial infarction, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and early Alzheimer's disease are particularly vulnerable to depression. Drugs that may cause depressive symptoms are digitalis at toxic levels, beta-blockers, centrally acting antihypertensives, immunosuppressants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Cyclic antidepressants are the drugs of first choice. Selection depends on the patient's physical health and current medications and the side effect profile of the drug. Side effects are more pronounced in old age because of drug accumulation owing to slowed clearance. Troublesome side effects are anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension, sedation, cardiotoxicity, and weight gain. The most useful antidepressants for geriatric patients are the secondary amines, desipramine and nortriptyline. The second-generation drug trazodone has the advantage of causing the least anticholinergic effects, but it is very sedating. Before treatment, the patient should have an electrocardiogram, liver function tests, tonometry, sitting and standing blood pressures, evaluation of urinary symptoms for outflow obstruction, review of current medications, and estimation of suicide risk. Cyclic antidepressants are contraindicated during recovery from myocardial infarction, in heart disease when there is severe impairment of myocardial performance, in seizure disorders, and in the presence of glaucoma or a large prostate. Drug interactions that may cause trouble can occur with epinephrine, MAO inhibitors, thyroid hormone, cimetidine, and centrally acting antihypertensives. Dosage should start low, increasing usually by 25 mg every 4 to 5 days until a therapeutic level is reached. Failure of a noradrenergic antidepressant after 4 to 5 weeks can be followed by a trial of a serotonergic drug. Drug serum level monitoring is useful for imipramine, desipramine, and nortriptyline. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are effective in many elderly patients who are resistant to TCAs. Sympathomimetic drugs must be avoided with MAOIs. Elderly patients are at high risk of toxicity and drug interactions with lithium. Electroconvulsive therapy is useful for patients who do not respond to drug treatment, but medical complications, particularly cardiovascular, often occur in patients 75 or older. Many patients relapse after ECT. Psychotherapy together with pharmacotherapy may be the optimal treatment for elderly depressives. Older patients are more likely to become chronically depressed than younger patients. The risk of suicide in depressed elderly males is high, particularly in those with psychosocial problems, and depression rises with age.\r"

  ".W": "Fever is a prominent sign of an acute-phase response induced by microbial invasion, tissue injury, immunologic reactions, or inflammatory processes. This generalized host response is produced by a multiplicity of localized or systemic diseases and characterized by acute, subacute, or chronic changes in metabolic, endocrinologic, neurologic, and immunologic functions. The fundamental event is an initiation of the acute-phase response by the production of a mediated molecule called IL-1. This polypeptide is produced primarily from phagocytic cells such as blood monocytes, phagocytic lining cells of the liver and spleen, and other tissue macrophages. IL-1 produces a local reaction but also enters the circulation, acting as a hormone to mediate distant organ system responses to infection, immunologic reaction, and inflammatory processes. Fever is the result when IL-1 initiates the synthesis of prostaglandins, notably prostaglandin E2 in the thermoregulatory center located in the anterior hypothalamus. The thermostatic set point is then raised and mechanisms to conserve heat (vasoconstriction) and to produce heat (shivering) are initiated. The result is a sudden rise in body temperature. The same basic mechanisms are involved in FUO. Many of the biologic and biochemical changes that are seen in FUO are also evidence of an acute-phase response. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is partly due to increased synthesis of hepatic proteins, including compliment components, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. IL-1 acts directly on the bone marrow to increase absolute numbers and immaturity of circulating neutrophils. Anemia is produced by many mechanisms, including the reduction of circulating serum iron. Although fever production in the elderly maybe delayed or of less intensity, it is still a marker of significant disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Most patients with urinary incontinence can be cured or improved through proper diagnosis and management. Many incontinent patients can be treated based on history, physical examination, and simple laboratory and bedside testing. Efforts are currently underway to determine the best method for selecting patients who require referral for urologic evaluation and urodynamic testing. Behavioral therapy, drugs, and surgery, alone or in combination, will result in marked improvement for many patients. For others, careful attention to environmental support may minimize the impact of incontinence. An optimistic and enthusiastic attitude on the part of the treating physician is important in improving patient compliance with long-term therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Because of complex variables and unsettled treatment issues, a standardized prescription for imaging the acutely traumatized kidney cannot be written. Imaging considerations are based on treatment considerations and will vary from place to place, from patient to patient, from physician to physician, and even from time to time in the same institution. The condition of the patient, the availability of resources and personnel, and (especially) whether existing treatment policy is conservative or aggressive will govern the selection of studies. Above all, since the kidney may be only one of several organs requiring immediate investigation, it is always the totality of the situation that sets the tone for the imaging process. A synthesis of prevailing thought is depicted diagrammatically in Figure 2 and is summarized as follows: CT is the most informative radiologic study in renal trauma and is the examination of choice in patients suspected of having serious renal injuries or associated injuries amenable to CT evaluation. CT is wasteful, however, in the stable, asymptomatic patient who is perceived to have only a minor, exclusively renal injury. Here, excretory urography is an acceptable alternative. Most of these patients will have normal findings at urography, all but ruling out significant renal damage. The vast majority of patients will fall into this category but for those whose urograms do not provide adequate information for management, CT is performed next. Sonography and radionuclide imaging, while advocated in some quarters, do not enjoy wide acceptance in the United States as first-line triage studies. They are usually reserved for selected situations, mainly for follow-up. Arteriography still has a place, primarily in preoperative road mapping, and for therapeutic interventions such as embolization of bleeding vessels and arteriovenous fistulas. The role of MR imaging has yet to be defined. The choice of imaging in renal trauma requires discretion, judgement, and common sense. Standard protocols are useful, but there is a place for flexibility and the customizing of individual approaches.\r"

The patients with benign disease had failed treatment with surgical reconstruction and transhepatic balloon dilation. All patients had immediate relief of jaundice and cholangitis. In a follow-up period of 6-21 months, nine of the 11 patients with benign disease had no difficulties with infection, pruritis, or recurrent jaundice. In patients with malignant strictures, the stent produced relief of biliary obstruction unless recurrent tumor invaded the bile ducts. With careful patient selection, this stent appears to be useful in the management of biliary obstruction, particularly in benign disease.\r"

Twenty-eight patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty, and two patients underwent laser angioplasty alone. Acute angiographic and clinical success was achieved in 24 of 31 (77%) femoropopliteal stenoses and occlusions. Seven of nine (78%) stenoses, six of seven (86%) short (0-5 cm) occlusions, seven of eight (88%) medium-length (6-10 cm) occlusions, three of four (75%) long (11-15 cm) occlusions, and one of three (33%) extreme (greater than 15 cm) occlusions were successfully treated. Inability to treat total occlusions was in each case related to a failure to maintain coaxial position and subintimal passage of the fiber. These cases demonstrate the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous peripheral excimer-laser or excimer-laser-assisted angioplasty. The overall frequency of restenosis after a mean follow-up period of 9.1 months was 29%. The data suggest that these procedures may be useful for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease in selected patients.\r"

Flow velocity measurements were made in the intracranial internal carotid artery and anterior cerebral artery. Resistive index (RI) was calculated in each patient and used as an indicator of diastolic flow. Eight of nine infants showed markedly elevated RI (100%-191%) with reversal of diastolic flow. One infant had low RI (42%-58%) with preserved systolic and diastolic flow until death. The authors believe that the elevation of RI with diastolic flow reversal seen in these patients is a reflection of increased intracranial pressure and is a sign of poor prognosis when present on serial examinations. Cranial duplex pulsed Doppler US is a useful, noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of brain death in infants but must be carefully correlated with clinical examination and other diagnostic tests.\r"

Fifty healthy subjects were examined to assess the pattern of a sonographically normal-appearing liver surface. A second group of 75 patients, mainly with suspected diffuse chronic liver disease, was examined with particular attention to the most commonly described sonographic signs of cirrhosis, and laparoscopy and biopsy were also performed. The liver surface was examined in a third group of 225 patients with cancer in whom metastases had been demonstrated sonographically. A diagnosis of cirrhosis was made with sonography when surface irregularities were observed that were comparable to the anatomic abnormalities of a cirrhotic liver surface. An examination of the liver surface gave the best diagnostic rate for cirrhosis (88%). There were seven false-negative results, but in five of them no surface nodularity could be seen at laparoscopy, and the diagnosis was made only on the basis of histologic studies; there was one false-positive result. This study indicated that ultrasonography might be a reliable method to follow up patients with chronic liver disease that may progress to cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of examining the lateral ventricular atrium, cisterna magna, and cavum septi pellucidi as a means of ascertaining that the development of the fetal central nervous system (CNS) is normal, a retrospective evaluation of the sonograms of 112 fetuses (15-39 weeks gestational age) with sonographically diagnosed CNS anomalies was performed. Malformations included in the study were diverse. The lateral ventricular atrium was enlarged (greater than 10 mm) in 99 (88%) fetuses. Of the remaining 13 fetuses, seven had an abnormal-sized cisterna magna (less than 2 mm or greater than 11 mm). These two measurements alone could be used to identify the presence of a CNS abnormality in 95%. Three of the six remaining fetuses exhibited gross abnormalities easily seen on the standard axial images obtained for biparietal diameter measurement. Although the cavum septi pellucidi was absent in a number of cases, its absence did not enhance sensitivity in the cohort examined. Prospective examination of 130 consecutive normal fetuses (15-40 weeks gestational age) was also performed. When specifically sought, the ventricular atrium was identifiable and measurable 99% of the time; the cisterna magna, 90% of the time; and the cavum septi pellucidi, 95% of the time. Because major CNS anomalies are uncommon and these measurements afford high sensitivity, an extremely low probability (0.005%) of abnormal brain or spinal cord development can be predicted if a normal-sized lateral ventricular atrium and cisterna magna are present. These results should not be construed as a license to underexamine fetuses for malformations. Rather, these measurements should serve as simple positive steps to assist in a difficult task.\r"

Twenty fetuses had myelomeningocele, 14 had isolated ventriculomegaly, and 33 were normal. A normal-sized cisterna magna (range, 4-9 mm in depth) was present in all normal fetuses. In 19 of 20 fetuses with myelomeningocele, the views of the posterior fossa were adequate, and in each of these the cisterna magna was effaced (n = 18) or very small (n = 1). The cisterna magna was effaced in five of 13 (38%) fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly in whom the posterior fossa was adequately imaged. Although effacement of the cisterna magna is a nonspecific finding, the high negative predictive value of this sign is useful during routine screening of the fetal neural axis.\r"

Most patients were female (3.4:1), younger than 6 months (50%), and asymptomatic. Abdominal radiography demonstrated a mass in 95%, calcium in 92%, and fat in 60% of cases in which CT revealed these components. Similarly, sonography showed uncomplicated fluid in 76% and calcium in 50% of cases. Fat was not reliably distinguished from other soft-tissue components on sonograms. The most characteristic radiologic findings of mature teratoma of the retroperitoneum are a complex mass containing a well-circumscribed fluid component of variable volume, adipose tissue and/or sebum in the form of a fat-fluid level, and calcification in either a congealed or linear strand pattern. These findings are better demonstrated by CT than by sonography.\r"

Fifty patients underwent simultaneous renal imaging studies with I-131 OIH and Tc-99m MAG3. The superior physical properties of the Tc-99m label led to better image quality in all cases, largely due to count rates that were 50-fold better. In two patients, lesions were seen with MAG3 that were not visible with OIH. The biological properties of the two agents were found to be so similar that conventional diagnostic criteria for I-131 OIH could be used for Tc-99m MAG3 with only minor modifications.\r"

Biopsies were performed in 73 patients; the findings were benign in 67 cases, and carcinoma was found in six. Imaging studies were considered helpful in four of the 15 cases of suspected abscess, in that the studies established the presence and extent of an abscess. Studies in 275 women were performed for a variety of other indications. The findings were normal in 239 (87%) studies, benign in 21 (8%), and suggestive of malignancy in 15 (5%); there were no known carcinomas in any of the patients. Women with the \"low-yield\" indications identified in this study should be followed up clinically rather than referred for imaging studies.\r"

Two independent systems were used for these measurements: a spectrum analyzer and a data acquisition system that computed the fast Fourier transform of the reflected waveform. Results showed that probe frequency (calibrated by the manufacturer in the transmit mode with a hydrophone) was as much as 30% higher than that found by means of frequency measurement procedures with the probe attached to the ultrasound system and evaluated in the receive mode. Such large discrepancies indicate that if acceptance testing of the frequency spectrum is not performed at a clinical facility, prolonged clinical evaluation of new equipment should be arranged.\r"

The authors present their preliminary experience with a sonographic technique for evaluating the internal mammary lymph nodes, artery, and vein. Longitudinal and transverse images of the first through fourth parasternal rib interspaces were acquired with a 5.0- or 7.5-MHz linear-array real-time system. The method was evaluated prospectively in 36 control subjects and in seven patients (six with metastatic breast cancer and one with lymphocytic lymphoma) who had enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes at thoracic computed tomography (CT). The longitudinal scans routinely demonstrated the internal mammary vessels in the upper interspaces. Lymphatic structures were not identified in the control group. In contrast, sonographic findings corresponding to the CT findings of lymphadenopathy were present in all seven patients. The authors believe that parasternal sonography is a promising technique that merits further study.\r"

An IE occurs with the penicillins against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species, and a variable IE occurs with cephalosporins; however, no IE occurs with aminoglycosides, quinolones, imipenem, and chloramphenicol against these organisms. An IE occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and with the penicillins and the cephalosporins against penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Branhamella catarrhalis. An IE occurs with the penicillins and cephalosporins against the Bacteroides fragilis group; no IE occurs with cefoxitin and imipenem. Although certain antibiotics exhibit an IE, they are still capable of eradicating infections when administered appropriately. Thus, the clinical significance of this laboratory phenomenon has yet to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "To provide a conceptual basis applicable to future antimalarial efforts, we sought to identify the sources of success in three notable campaigns that were consummated largely before DDT became available. A variety of measures directed against the aquatic stages of the anopheline vectors provided the main strategy for the antimalarial programs in Palestine/Israel, Italy, and the Tennessee River Valley of the United States. Source reduction-the modification or elimination of aquatic habitats to reduce mosquito breeding-was applied extensively and proved decisive. In all three regions, transmission of malaria was reduced to the point of extinction. Effective measures against anopheline larvae, in particular through source reduction, depend upon locally derived ecologic concepts that can be adapted to each vector species and applied continuously without limit of time. An integrated control program based on the long-term application of such measures can suppress transmission of malaria in edemic areas, as well as contain episodes of locally increased transmission of malaria.\r"

Sporadic cases have been increasingly reported from countries located between 20 degrees north latitude and 20 degrees south latitude as well as in travelers and in soldiers who have resided in these areas. The organisms are commonly found in water and soil and are usually transmitted to humans by cutaneous or respiratory routes. Clinical manifestations range from subclinical infection to overwhelming septicemia that resembles disseminated or localized suppurative infection due to various pathogens. A rapid and accurate diagnosis can be made by demonstration of small, few, and frequently bipolar-stained gram-negative bacilli in exudate or pus. The indirect hemagglutination test is of diagnostic value in cases with involvement of the internal organs or pyrexia of unknown origin. Chloramphenicol, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and kanamycin constitute conventional and effective chemotherapy. Newer antimicrobial agents such as piperacillin, amoxillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, imipenem, and carumonam are active in susceptibility tests against the causative microorganism, Pseudomonas pseudomallei. Clinical trials for demonstration of the effectiveness of the latter agents in overwhelming septicemic melioidosis are ongoing in endemic areas.\r"

It is clear from the epidemiologic evidence that cervical cancer has a multifactorial etiology involving infection with sexually transmitted agents such as genital papillomaviruses and cofactors such as pregnancy, smoking, use of hormonal contraceptives, and diet. The evidence implicating papillomavirus as an etiologic agent of cervical cancer has come from a variety of observational laboratory studies. Genital papillomaviruses induce dysplastic lesions. Most invasive cervical cancers contain papillomavirus DNA, as do cell lines derived from cervical cancers. Viral DNA, appears to be integrated into cellular DNA, and integration involves highly conserved, transcriptionally active regions of the viral DNA.\r"

Attenuated live vaccines, such as F. tularensis LVS (live vaccine strain), afford good--although not complete--protection; how to judge the degree of this protection has long been a problem. Both natural infection and vaccination result in immunospecific and long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The latter is the crucial protective mechanism, whereas the humoral response protects only against strains of reduced virulence, such as those used in the vaccines. Immune serum has been used to screen for structures of F. tularensis with the ability to induce a protective immune response. This immune serum is, however, primarily directed toward antigens different from those involved in cell-mediated immunity. Serum antibodies from primed individuals recognize carbohydrate capsule antigens of F. tularensis, whereas T lymphocytes recognize membrane polypeptides of the organism. The preparation of membrane polypeptides from F. tularensis is now facilitated by the availability of a capsule-deficient mutant of F. tularensis LVS. In vitro, several membrane polypeptides of the mutant stimulate T lymphocytes from vaccinees and from naturally infected individuals. Further studies of the mechanisms of induction of protective immunity should focus on these membrane polypeptides.\r"

Occasionally, common viral pathogens lead to illnesses in which hemostatic impairment is an important feature. In these instances, two clinical syndromes usually are present: thrombocytopenic purpura and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Immune mechanisms are implicated in the first, while the second is associated with severe disease. Hepatitis viruses produce hemorrhage by a third mechanism. In cases of fulminant hepatitis, hepatocellular injury leads to decreased production of multiple coagulation factors and impairment of other hepatic functions that modulate hemostasis. A small number of viruses stand apart by virtue of the frequency with which they cause hemorrhage. These are the hemorrhagic fever viruses. Much more needs to be learned about how these viruses cause disease and induce hemorrhage. The first line of therapy in viral infections complicated by hemorrhage is early treatment with an antiviral agent. Unfortunately, effective antiviral therapy is usually not available. There is little useful information and no controlled studies on the efficacy of therapy aimed directly at correcting hemostatic impairment.\r"

Among the viruses studied, no differences were noted in the ability to grow in endothelial cells from these three large vessels. One virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, was evaluated for its ability to produce persistent infection of endothelial cells. Infection developed and persisted for up to 3 months. After the first week, productive infection was found in less than 1% of cells. Nevertheless, the infection markedly affected the growth and morphology of the endothelial monolayer. Infection with any of several different viruses was noted to alter endothelial cell functions, including adherence of granulocytes, production of colony-stimulating factor, and synthesis of matrix protein. In addition, herpes simplex virus type 1 induced receptors for the Fc portion of IgG and for complement component C3b. These findings indicate that common human viruses can profoundly affect the biology of the endothelium.\r"

Children with Kawasaki syndrome may develop cytolytic IgM antibodies that recognize surface antigens induced on endothelial cells by interferon-gamma, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor. The presence of alloantibodies to tissue-restricted polymorphic antigens expressed by endothelial cells is frequently associated with thrombotic microvascular injury and hyperacute allograft rejection. Binding of antibodies and immune complexes to endothelial cells in vitro initiates platelet adherence, production of tissue factor, and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor. Antibody-mediated endothelial cell injury may play a role in other vascular disorders of unknown cause.\r"

A biologic role for PCA in the pathogenesis of MHV-3 infection is suggested by results of in vivo microscopic observations made during acute MHV-3 infection. Recently, it has been demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 abrogates the induction of PCA by MHV-3 both in vivo and in vitro and prevents hepatic necrosis and the associated microcirculatory changes. These data suggest that MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade and provide further evidence for a role for PCA in the pathogenesis of MHV-3 infection.\r"

Monocytes and monocytic cell lines have been used to investigate the ability of viruses to infect these cells in vitro. Several factors may affect the ability of a particular virus to infect monocytic cells, including specific antiserum to virus and the degree of cellular maturation. The effect of cellular maturation on the replication of Rift Valley fever virus in the U937 cell line is discussed in light of studies on the infectivity of other viruses for monocytic cells. Data supporting the ability of specific antibody to enhance the infectivity of Pichinde virus and Lassa fever virus for U937 cells are presented.\r"

  ".U": "89317155\r", 
  ".W": "Although many viral infections have on occasion been associated with hemorrhagic complications, infection with any of several RNA viruses regularly results in vascular involvement and the syndrome called viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). In spite of clinically useful similarities among various VHFs, there are significant differences in their pathogenesis and clinical evolution; these are often related to characteristics of their viral taxon. Infection with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, a phlebovirus, appears to be regulated by interferon and terminated by neutralizing antibody. In contrast, Lassa fever (LF) virus, an arenavirus, is resistant to interferon, and LF is terminated by cellular immune effector mechanisms. The lytic virus-cell interaction typical of RVF virus suggests its major effects occur by direct, virus-induced cellular necrosis, particularly in the liver. In the primate RVF model, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may be important. LF virus--characteristically noncytopathic--may exert its effects through induction of mediator secretion from infected macrophages. DIC does not appear to be a central pathogenetic mechanism in LF. Pichinde virus, which is not pathogenic for humans, provides an alternate model for study of LF. Infected guinea pigs do not show histologic lesions that could explain their body wasting, cardiovascular deterioration, and pulmonary edema. In the heart, for example, loss of tissue mass, protein, and contractile function proceed without direct viral involvement or myocarditis. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes have been implicated as one relevant soluble mediator participating in the disease state.\r"

In therapeutic studies it has not prevented late-onset neurologic disease. In human cases of Lassa fever, it significantly reduces mortality when administered before day 7 of illness to persons at high risk. In rodents and monkeys infected with Rift Valley fever virus, ribavirin therapy resulted in reduced mortality; prophylactic administration to volunteers infected with sandfly fever virus, Sicilian strain, prevented development of illness. Ribavirin increased the number of survivors and the mean time to death in suckling mice infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and in suckling mice infected with Hantaan virus. In the People's Republic of China, ribavirin significantly reduced mortality in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Ribavirin has not been effective in animal models of filoviral and flaviviral infections. The only important adverse effect of ribavirin in humans is manageable, reversible anemia.\r"

There was no correlation between severity of the disease and occurrence of impairment of coagulation. Complement activation was observed during the acute phase of AHF. There was reduction of total complement and C2 activity. Antigenic levels of C1q, C3, and C5 were low; level of C4 antigen was high. Degradation products of C3 and B were demonstrated before day 11.

Rift Valley fever is characterized by an incubation period of approximately 3 or 4 days, sudden onset of fever with a biphasic course, and signs and symptoms of liver and kidney disorder. The commonest complication is retinitis with a central scotoma. Severe cases may develop a hemorrhagic state, which may be fatal. Marburg virus disease was studied in two Australian students after a tour of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and in a nurse who cared for them. The incubation period of approximately 7 days is followed by sudden onset of fever (typically lasting 7 days) and the appearance of a maculopapular petechial rash on the 5th day. A hemorrhagic state develops about the same time and may be fatal. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is widespread in South Africa; it may be transmitted by tick bite of the species Hyalomma, by contact with the tissues of animals, or by contact with infected patients.\r"

Limited observations by electron microscopy and fluorescent antibody testing and the recovery of virus from tissues obtained at autopsy show that dengue viruses are consistently associated with cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage. In particular, virus is associated with Kupffer cells, pulmonary macrophages, and mononuclear cells in skin and blood. Endothelial cells fail to demonstrate necrosis or inflammatory changes. Since acute vascular permeability, shock, and hemorrhage occur late in illness, a plausible hypothesis is that phlogistic factors, resulting from interactions with elements of the immune response, are released from virus-infected mononuclear phagocytes. Such phenomena as generalized depression of mitotic activity of bone marrow cells, destruction of mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes, complement activation, and abnormal hemostasis may serve as markers of these phlogistic factors. It will be of interest to establish whether other viral hemorrhagic fevers involve the same target cells as in DHF/DSS and are mediated by similar effector mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Dengue can be caused by any one of four viruses that are antigenically related but not cross-protective. It has been proposed that the disease may be more severe if an infection with one dengue serotype follows infection with another serotype. Both experimental and epidemiologic data have been cited to substantiate this concept, but the present reviewer does not find the data convincing. The issue is of practical importance because of its relevance to the use of dengue vaccines now under development. It is impossible to prove that clinical manifestations of dengue are not exacerbated by sequential infections. Negative findings can always be countered by arguments that exacerbation occurs only with certain serotypes, only with certain strains of those serotypes, or only when infections occur at critical intervals. Interested persons can examine the relevant data and decide whether the concept of disease exacerbation following sequential dengue infections is myth or reality.\r"

  ".W": "In 1978, dengue was reported in China for the first time in 32 years. Since then, epidemics involving hundreds of thousands of people have occurred in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and on Hainan Island. These epidemics were caused by all four types of dengue virus. Aedes aegypti was the vector in coastal areas, while Aedes albopictus was the vector in inland regions. During these epidemics, case rates were very high (greater than 50%) in some areas. Case-fatality rates were generally less than 0.1% except during the 1986 outbreak on Hainan Island, when the rate was 0.25%. Hemorrhagic disease occurred in both children and adults. On Hainan Island, hemorrhagic disease was more than three times as common in the 1986 outbreak as in the 1980 outbreak; the 1980 outbreak was caused by dengue virus type 3 and the 1986 outbreak by dengue virus type 2. The weight of the evidence suggests that the reemergence of dengue in China resulted from the introduction of the infection by travelers and refugees from areas of Asia where dengue is endemic.\r"

Concurrently, there was an outbreak of febrile, occasionally fatal illness among people living in the vicinity. The disease was caused by a new tick-borne flavivirus belonging to the Russian spring-summer encephalitis complex of viruses. The early clinical description of the disease included severe cases with hemorrhagic manifestations, including intermittent epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and frank blood in the stools. Pathologic and hematologic investigations emphasized similarities with Omsk hemorrhagic fever. Two years later there was a shift in clinical emphasis from hemorrhagic to neurologic complications; this could have resulted from the special interests or bias of the principal investigator or the changing patterns of intercurrent infections. Clinical, clinicopathologic, hematologic, and hemostatic features of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) are described, particularly in relation to IgE as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possibly of other hemorrhagic fevers.\r"

Its hemorrhagic manifestations are so mild that initially--as its name implies--it was not considered a hemorrhagic fever. It is, however, clinically, histologically, and epidemiologically similar to Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF) except that hemorrhagic manifestations are fewer and mortality is lower. The etiologic agents of the two disorders, Puumala virus (NE) and Hantaan virus (KHF), are closely related. NE is the most benign of the hemorrhagic fevers. Hemostatic impairment is not a significant clinical problem in this disease and therefore has not been thoroughly studied, although abnormalities in hemostasis have been noted. Further investigations of this disease might provide insights concerning the treatment of other, more severe, hemorrhagic fevers.\r"

Petechiae involving skin and oropharyngeal mucosa are the commonest manifestation of hemorrhage, occurring in more than 90% of patients. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is the next commonest manifestation, occurring in approximately 50% of patients. Suggested mechanisms of hemorrhage include vascular injury, thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, circulating heparin-like activity, and uremia. Controlled trials of treatment regimens for hemostatic impairment in HFRS have not been performed. Support of blood pressure can lessen hemorrhage by limiting the adverse consequences of hypotension and shock. Dialysis is of benefit in patients with hemorrhage and significant renal failure.\r"

Left anterior thoracotomy was employed in all but one case, in which median sternotomy was preferred because of extensive left pleural calcifications. There were three early and 11 late deaths. Actuarial survival at 5 and 10 years was 77% and 64%, respectively. Relief of symptoms was reported by 16 of the 33 patients (49%), who survived the postoperative period. These 16 were among the 22 survivors observed for a median of 8 (range 2-17) years postoperatively. Complete pericardectomy was achieved in all 16 asymptomatic patients, but in only nine of the 17 hospital survivors (53%), with persistent heart failure (p less than 0.01). Pericardial calcifications were significantly less common in the former than in the latter group. Lack of postoperative improvement was related to severe, nonresectable calcifications, and probably in some cases to associated fibrous epicarditis or restrictive myocardial disease. Left thoracotomy permits easier and more complete left ventricular pericardectomy, but is less safe when severe calcifications involve the right ventricle and atrium.\r"

Insulin administration was begun when the last proximal anastomosis had been completed. Cardiac output and central pressures were monitored for 1 hour after termination of ECC. Systemic vascular resistance in both groups was lower at the end of ECC than before surgery (reduction 39% in the controls, 51% in the insulin-treated group). During the following hour the peripheral resistance increased significantly in the controls (from 20 +/- 2 to 29 +/- 2 mmHg X min X m2/l), but no change was found in the insulin group.

In the leg a small glucose uptake was found while the lactate balance was negative. During the study period the lactate release increased further in the control group. In the myocardium no significant extraction of glucose or lactate could be demonstrated. Insulin treatment resulted in a fivefold increment of leg glucose uptake and in significant myocardial glucose uptake. Myocardial lactate balance was also improved by insulin treatment, with fractional extraction increased from 6 to 21%. It is concluded that myocardial carbohydrate metabolism is restricted in the early period after cardiac surgery, and that this seems to result from insulin resistance induced by the surgical trauma.\r"

The alveolo-arterial oxygen difference increased substantially and similarly in both patient groups, and no intergroup difference was found in incidence of atelectasis or pneumonic infiltration.

On average 2.9 grafts per patient were inserted, in conjunction with 82 manual endarterectomies (38 right coronary, 35 left anterior descending, 9 circumflex branches). In 68/75 cases (91%) the endarterectomy was not preplanned and in 39 cases (52%) greater than or equal to 3 cm of the atherosclerotic core was removed. All four early deaths (5%) followed endarterectomy of LAD. Acute perioperative myocardial infarction was confirmed in 19% and probable in further 8%. At angiography 1-139 (median 25) months postoperatively, all three internal mammary artery grafts and 19/34 saphenous vein grafts (56%) to endarterectomized vessels were patent, though in 4 of the 19, the coronary artery was occluded distal to the anastomosis. In addition 17/18 conventional internal mammary artery (94%) and 48/59 conventional saphenous vein grafts (81%) were patent. The vein graft patency rate was not significantly influenced by postoperative anticoagulant therapy, but was significantly increased among patients with relief of angina: 44% reported freedom from angina and 92% at least some relief after a median of 3 years. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 85% and 68%. Despite the increased risk, endarterectomy can be recommended for severely diseased major coronary arteries.\r"

Expression of early and late activation markers, interleukin-2 receptor and transferrin receptor, respectively, by PBMC was unaffected by antisense oligomer exposure as was the expression of c-myc messenger RNA. In contrast, histone H3 messenger RNA levels and DNA content were selectively decreased. These results suggest that c-myb protein deprivation does not perturb T lymphocyte activation or early molecular events that may prepare the cell for subsequent proliferation.

Ultrastructural analysis of the transporter by the protein A-gold technique showed that it is restricted to certain domains of the plasma membrane, its density being sixfold higher in microvilli facing adjacent endocrine cells than in the flat regions of the plasma membrane. These results support a possible role for this glucose transporter in glucose sensing by beta cells and provide evidence that these cells are polarized.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) selectively infects cells expressing the CD4 molecule, resulting in substantial quantitative and qualitative defects in CD4+ T lymphocyte function in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, only a very small number of cells in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected individuals are expressing virus at any given time. Previous studies have demonstrated that in vitro infection of CD4+ T cells with HIV-1 results in downregulation of CD4 expression such that CD4 protein is no longer detectable on the surface of the infected cells. In the present study, highly purified subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AIDS patients were obtained and purified by fluorescence-automated cell sorting. They were examined with the methodologies of virus isolation by limiting dilution analysis, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and gene amplification. Within PBMCs, HIV-1 was expressed in vivo predominantly in the T cell subpopulation which, in contrast to the in vitro observations, continued to express CD4. The precursor frequency of these HIV-1-expressing cells was about 1/1000 CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cell population contained HIV-1 DNA in all HIV-1-infected individuals studied and the frequency in AIDS patients was at least 1/100 cells. This high level of infection may be the primary cause for the progressive decline in number and function of CD4+ T cells in patients with AIDS.\r"

Mass battefield casualties spurred both technologic and medical changes necessary for today's sophisticated helicopter systems in use worldwide, particularly in the United States. The Napoleonic Era and the American Civil War provided the framework for the evolution of today's state-of-the-art emergency medical techniques. The use of airplanes to evacuate the wounded eventually led to using helicopters for rescue missions in World War II. The combat experiences of the United States in Korea, the British in Malaya, and the French in Indochina proved that rotary-wing aircraft were invaluable in reducing battlefield death rates. Any skepticism about the efficacy of helicopter medical evacuation was erased during the Vietnam conflict. As an integral part of the modern battlefield, these specialized aircraft became a necessity. The observations and experience of American servicemen and medical personnel in Vietnam established the foundation for the acceptance of helicopter transport in modern hospital systems.\r"

Several biochemical abnormalities have been noted in those with aortic aneurysms, including increased proteolysis (elastolysis and collagenolysis). At present, the precise etiology of aneurysmal disease remains unclear, but it will most likely turn out to be a heterogenous disease with several molecular forms.\r"

It is likely that the majority of such patients can undergo standard resection, either by referral to a center where the management of the elderly chronically ill is commonplace or by providing intensive preoperative metabolic, cardiac, pulmonary, and nutritional resuscitation. Such preoperative preparation might well include coronary revascularization or carotid endarterectomy. For the occasional patient in whom medical comorbidity is advanced and fixed, or in whom rapid aneurysm expansion or worsening symptoms mandate immediate management, yet operative risk for standard aneurysm resection seems inordinately high, several nonresective options have been identified and tested. Among these options, aneurysm exclusion appears to have significantly better results (in terms of lower rates of operative mortality and subsequent aneurysm rupture) than distal aneurysm ligature. A more recent technique, aneurysm bypass, may have potential but has not been tested for a long enough period, or by an adequate number of surgeons, to have established itself as a nonresective option. Clinical judgment, technical expertise, and a willingness to seek assistance and consultation remain the hallmarks of the optimal management of the patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\r"

The incidence of other concomitant intra-abdominal disease is much less. Because of the catastrophic complications associated with infection of synthetic aortic grafts, most authors have advised against opening a hollow viscus during aneurysm resection. Although Staphylococcus is the predominant organism responsible for graft infections, Szilagyi and associates and Liekweg and Greenfield found gram-negative organisms in 40 per cent of infected aortic prostheses. Thomas, Bickerstaff, and Fry and their coauthors have recommended caution when considering aneurysm resection and concomitant nonvascular operations. On the other hand, there is suggestive evidence that the risk of aneurysm rupture is increased in the postoperative period, especially if the aneurysm is greater than 6 cm in diameter. Therefore, optimum management of patients with aneurysms and other intra-abdominal pathology must reduce both the risk of graft infection and the risk of postoperative rupture. To reduce morbidity and mortality rates, careful preoperative evaluation for the detection and management of coexistent disease, the proper choice of intraoperative procedures, and close postoperative monitoring with prompt surgical intervention, as indicated, are essential.\r"

Reducing or eliminating homologous blood transfusion can be achieved by aggressive attention to three aspects of patient care: (1) routine use of autologous transfusion; (2) careful surgical technique, emphasizing the minimum dissection needed to expose the aneurysm adequately; and (3) a higher threshold for use of any blood products. In a prospective study of 100 consecutive aortic reconstructions, 80 per cent of patients undergoing aneurysm repair received only their own blood during hospitalization. Routine intraoperative autologous red-cell salvage has also conserved the bank blood supply by reducing usage of homologous blood by 75 per cent. The key to minimizing homologous blood requirements for aneurysm repair has been the development of rapid cell-washing autotransfusion devices.\r"

The renal arteries should be evaluated in patients with hypertension or renal dysfunction, and stenosis must be addressed when seen on arteriograms. Hemodynamically significant lesions are candidates for bypass concomitant with aortic replacement. The stump pressure of a patent inferior mesenteric artery should be assessed intraoperatively, and bypass or reimplantation should be performed if colon ischemia might result from internal mesenteric artery ligation. If vasculogenic impotence is suggested by preoperative studies, meticulous nerve-sparing dissection and revascularization of the internal iliac arteries may result in recovery of erectile function in some patients. In all cases of aneurysm repair, the hypogastric circulation must be maintained through either direct revascularization or bypass to major collateral arteries. Iliac occlusive disease may be evaluated with several modalities, including physical examination, noninvasive laboratory testing, arteriography, and the papaverine test, to determine whether critical or subcritical stenoses are present. Aortic bifurcation grafts should be used to construct the distal anastomoses beyond areas of significant disease. The extent of lower-extremity occlusive disease directly affects the long-term patency of aortic replacement, and diligent follow-up is necessary for timely intervention to maintain patency of vascular reconstructions.\r"

Having achieved these goals, there is a tendency to let down one's guard and relax; indeed, the principles of aneurysm repair beyond this point are similar to those of elective surgery. However, it should be remembered that nearly every complication is more likely in emergency than in elective operations. Therefore, even more care needs to be taken with the technical details at this point to avoid the complications discussed in the following article. The perioperative management must continue at the same heightened level to combat acidosis, hypothermia, coagulation disorders, cardiac dysfunction, fluid overload with pulmonary edema, renal failure, and other common sequelae of this challenging undertaking.\r"

A morphologically homogeneous cell plaque showing a cobblestone appearance was removed 2 to 3 weeks after the seeding, and the cells were subcultured. The cultured cells grew as monolayers of flat polygonal cells and were carried for more than 20 passages without morphologic change. These cells synthesized prostacyclin and retained an endothelial specific marker, factor VIII-related antigen. When the cells were cultured in a collagen gel, they rapidly formed capillarylike tubular structures without endothelial cell growth factor or special substrata. Long-term culture of purified microvascular endothelial cells derived from Mongolian gerbil brain will facilitate the study of the function of microvascular endothelial cells in human brain under normal and pathologic conditions.\r"

Of all the modalities of therapy currently available, surgical resection holds the most promise for cure or prolonged survival. Treatment for extensive local disease or metastatic disease has been discouraging, and the prognosis for reasonable, comfortable survival is poor. Unfortunately, the toxicity of mitotane, an adrenolytic agent and currently the most effective drug available, is often unacceptable and may militate against its use. Because many of the debilitating side effects of these tumors are related to hormone production, newer drugs that result in hormonal blockade may add considerably to the comfort of the patient. The development of less toxic chemotherapeutic agents presents a challenge for both the oncologist and the endocrinologist.\r"

Despite its often-dramatic presentation, there typically has been a distressingly long delay between the onset of symptoms and the time of diagnosis, which undoubtedly has contributed to the poor prognosis in these children by permitting the disease to reach an advanced stage before treatment is started. It is therefore imperative that the physician recognize the endocrine manifestations of these tumors. Although biochemical evaluation is helpful, it often cannot differentiate benign from malignant neoplasms and therefore should not unduly delay intervention. Aggressive surgical resection continues to be the mainstay of treatment as the role of adjuvant therapy continues to evolve. It is hoped that increased familiarity with this unusual tumor will result in earlier detection, prompt intervention, and improved survival for children with adrenocortical carcinoma.\r"

In most patients, detailed endocrinologic and radiologic testing will differentiate between Cushing's disease, adrenal adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, primary bilateral nodular hyperplasia, and ectopic corticotropin-producing tumors. Although adrenal surgery affords rapid and reliable remission in patients with Cushing's syndrome, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Complications can be minimized by careful perioperative preparation. The indications for adrenal surgery for Cushing's disease have been altered radically by the success and low morbidity of transsphenoidal surgery. Total adrenalectomy is indicated in patients with bilateral nodular hyperplasia and should be considered for adults who have failed selective pituitary adenectomy or hypophysectomy and in whom ectopic corticotropin secretion has been unequivocally ruled out. At the Lahey Clinic, total adrenalectomy is performed through an anterior abdominal incision. Anterior approaches are especially indicated in those patients who require abdominal exploration for other intra-abdominal pathologic conditions that require surgery. Total adrenalectomy is indicated in the very rare patient who has Cushing's syndrome caused by ectopic corticotropin production when the patient is severely ill, a primary tumor is not found, and medical therapy fails or is poorly tolerated. Small adrenal tumors are best approached through a flank incision. Larger potentially malignant tumors should be approached through a thoracoabdominal incision.\r"

The combination of high serum and urinary cortisol and high plasma ACTH point to a nonadrenal source for Cushing's syndrome. It is important to rule out an ectopic source of ACTH production. Imaging of the sella with MRI and CT and sampling petrosal sinus blood for ACTH measurement should allow differentiation between the two conditions. For younger patients, every effort should be made to preserve the normal gland. If in the younger patient the adenoma cannot be clearly demonstrated, it is appropriate to remove the central portion of the gland, as advocated by Hardy. Should hypercortisolism persist, radiation therapy to the sella should be considered before attempting total hypophysectomy. In the woman past childbearing age, a total hypophysectomy can readily be considered if a sharply demarcated adenoma is not found. In fact, we counsel our older patients before operation that a total hypophysectomy is a possibility. For the patient with an aggressive tumor that is not cured by pituitary operation, radiation therapy must be considered. If it is not possible to wait for the therapeutic effect of radiation, adrenal suppression with aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, or ketoconazole is indicated. Adrenalectomy may be considered.\r"

Eleven men (40%) were found to have cancer, all having hypoechoic lesions. The remainder were found to have benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) with hyperechoic lesions predominating (88%). Our results suggest that transrectal ultrasound is a useful and sensitive method for the detection of prostate tumors not clinically evident on digital rectal examination in select patients.\r"

We report a series of 84 pediatric patients--younger than 16 years--who underwent 92 fine-needle aspiration biopsies to evaluate a large variety of masses. The results of 51 (55%) were benign, and 33 (36%) biopsies revealed malignancy. In two cases (2%) the findings were suggestive of malignancy, and in six cases (7%), insufficient material was rendered for diagnosis. Either histologic or clinical follow-up or both were available for 85 procedures. Based on these cases, the sensitivity of 97% and the specificity was 95%, indicating that fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a good method for screening and observing patients for various malignant tumors in a variety of organs.\r"

Immunoprophylaxis using hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis immune globulin has been highly effective in decreasing the probability of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in infants with exposure. Previously, the Centers for Disease Control recommended screening pregnant women considered at high risk of hepatitis B infection to detect newborns who would benefit from postnatal immunizations directed at preventing the HBV carrier state. Because of the poor sensitivity of high-risk criteria in distinguishing pregnant women who harbor the hepatitis B virus, these recommendations have recently been revised to call for the routine screening of all pregnant women in the United States.\r"

High-energy injury fractures have a nonunion rate as high as 75%. Other factors that may lead to nonunion are inappropriate treatment, infection, and preexisting disease. The diagnosis of nonunion is based largely on clinical examination. Plain radiographs and tomograms, computed tomograms, and contrast imaging may be used to confirm nonhealing. Radionuclide imaging can help determine the presence of infection, an impaired blood supply, or impaired osteogenic activity at the fracture site. The treatment of ununited fractures is based on the principles of good fracture management: adequate immobilization, asepsis and soft tissue cover, osteoconduction (bone contact), osteoinduction (stimulation of bone growth), and metabolic well-being. New modalities for osteoinduction are promising adjuncts to standard treatment, the autogenous bone graft, but conclusive proof of efficacy in humans does not yet exist.\r"

The diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in patients with evidence of HIV infection qualifies as a criterion of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Demographic characteristics of patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection vary by region and reflect the degree to which patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection adopt behaviors that put them at risk for HIV infection. The clinical features of tuberculosis in patients with HIV infection are atypical. Extrapulmonary disease, tuberculin anergy, and unusual findings on chest radiographs occur most frequently when tuberculosis afflicts patients with other clinical evidence of HIV infection at the time tuberculosis is diagnosed. Treatment is effective for tuberculosis in HIV-seropositive patients, and isoniazid prophylaxis is recommended for HIV-infected patients with positive tuberculin skin tests.\r"

One hundred of 111 Papanicolaou smears obtained with a cytobrush and Ayre spatula contained endocervical cells (90.1 percent), compared with 68 of 105 smears obtained with the extended-tip spatula (64.8 percent) (chi 2 = 18.6, P less than 0.0001).

Blood pressure response during maximal ergometric exercise testing was observed in 183 persons with no history of hypertension, 176 persons with borderline blood pressure readings, and 60 established hypertensives. Men and women had significantly different blood pressure response to exercise (P less than 0.05). Comparison of blood pressures at 100-watts workload, at peak exercise, and 5-minutes postexercise provided significant information for distinguishing between normal, borderline, and established hypertensive persons (P less than 0.025-0.001). Comparing the slopes of pulse rate versus blood pressure linear regression curves was not helpful. Regression equations generated for predicting correct blood pressure classification improved classification accuracy (compared with random classification) by 44.9 percent in men and by 66.8 percent in women. The results showed that ergometric stress testing in blood pressure evaluation is a safe and reliable procedure for aiding in a more accurate diagnosis of hypertension.\r"

It results from repetitive eccentric load-induced microtrauma that stresses the peritendinous structures causing inflammation. Achilles tendinitis may be classified histologically as peritendinitis, tendinosis, or partial tendon rupture. Training errors are frequently responsible for the onset of Achilles tendinitis. These include excessive running mileage and training intensity, hill running, running on hard or uneven surfaces, and wearing poorly designed running shoes. Biomechanical abnormalities that predispose to Achilles tendinitis include gastrocnemius-soleus muscle weakness or inflexibility and hindfoot malalignment with foot hyperpronation. The initial treatment should be conservative with relative rest, gastrocnemius-soleus rehabilitation, cryotherapy, heel lifts, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and correction of biomechanical abnormalities. Surgery is recommended only for persons with chronic symptoms who wish to continue running and have not benefited from conservative therapy.\r"

Gallstones are removed either during surgery or by subsequent radiologic manipulation. Most such patients do not undergo subsequent cholecystectomy. The frequency of gallbladder stone and/or biliary symptom recurrence was studied in 63 patients who had undergone successful cholecystolithotomy. Follow-up examinations in 48 of these patients, performed at a mean of 18 +/- 12 months after surgery, showed recurrence of gallstones in 13 patients (27%). This included 12 of 38 patients who had follow-up sonograms and one of two cadavers that underwent autopsy. None of eight patients who had a subsequent cholecystectomy had recurrent stones. Two of 17 patients studied within 1 year of cholecystolithotomy had recurrent calculi, as did six of 21 patients studied at 1-2 years, four of five patients studied at 2-3 years, and one of five patients studied at 3-4 years. Biliary symptoms were assessed in 46 of the 48 patients who had follow-up examinations (two patients died) and in the 15 other patients who had undergone successful cholecystolithotomy. Recurrent or residual symptoms were present in seven (11%) of 61 patients, including three of the 13 patients with recurrent calculi. Six of these seven patients underwent further hospital treatment. These results confirm the anticipated high frequency of stone recurrence after cholecystolithotomy. However, because most patients with recurrent stones were asymptomatic, routine interval cholecystectomy may not be necessary.\r"

The procedures included CT with 3-, 5-, and/or 10-mm-thick sections (17 patients), 131I-6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy (16 patients), and MR imaging (six patients). Proof of the adrenal abnormality was established in cases of tumor (seven adenomas, one carcinoma) by surgery and in cases of adrenal hyperplasia by surgery (three cases); venous sampling (three cases); or combined clinical, biochemical, and imaging data (three cases). Both CT and scintigraphy detected six of the seven adenomas and the adrenal carcinoma (88%). Regarding hyperplasia, CT was correct in five of six and scintigraphy was correct in two of four cases proved by surgery or venous sampling. CT and NP-59 were concordant and suggested the diagnosis of hyperplasia in the remaining three cases without surgical or venous sampling proof. MR detected both cases of adenoma in which it was performed and showed evidence of hyperplasia in one of the four cases of hyperplasia in which it was performed. Although the number of patients in this series is too small to have much statistical power, these results suggest that CT and NP-59 scintigraphy are equivalent in the detection of adrenal abnormalities in patients with primary aldosteronism. The value of MR in the detection of small adrenal contour abnormalities was limited by slice thickness capabilities.\r"

All patients evaluated had an abnormal IV urogram or retrograde pyelogram in which the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the kidney or ureter was suspected or could not be excluded. The results of the brush biopsy were compared with the final diagnosis established at surgery or through clinical and surgical follow-up. Results of the biopsies were classified into five categories: (I) normal transitional epithelium (16 patients), (II) atypical cells (eight patients), (III) dysplastic cells (two patients), (IV) suspicious for malignancy (four patients), and (V) conclusive evidence of malignancy (eight patients). In four additional patients, other miscellaneous diagnoses were made, and in three others the procedure was nondiagnostic. Brush biopsies interpreted as Categories III, IV, and V had a positive predictive value of 100% (14/14) for the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma, and biopsies showing atypical cells (Category II) had a positive predictive value of 75% (6/8). Tabulating all diagnostic categories except for normal as a positive diagnosis, the procedure had a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 89%. No significant complications were encountered. This experience suggests that brush biopsy is a valuable technique in patients suspected of having transitional cell carcinoma.\r"

In 20 of these patients, a total of 22 conspicuous hypoechoic intratesticular bands (18 unilateral and four bilateral) were seen in the middle third of the testicle on scans obtained axially or slightly oblique to conventional axial scans. The bands were up to 3 mm wide and 3 cm long. The bands were on the side with suspected disease in six patients. Of these, three patients had a small epididymal cyst, one had a mild hydrocele, and two had no other sonographic finding. The remaining 16 bands were on the side opposite that with clinically suspected disease and were seen in otherwise normal testes. Follow-up examination in 11 of the 20 patients with the band showed no change. In four of eight patients examined with pulsed Doppler sonography, a normal low-resistance waveform was seen that was characteristic of intratesticular arteries (with gradual descent after peak systole and relatively high diastolic flow). In three of these patients, color Doppler imaging corroborated the presence of arterial flow, which did not fill the entire width of the band, thus suggesting an additional venous component of lower velocity in the band. Identification of flow in only half the cases may have been caused by the limitations in sensitivity of the equipment. We conclude that the hypoechoic bands noted on gray-scale testicular sonography are caused by a normal variant of intratesticular vessels, artery and vein, and that they are of no clinical significance.\r"

Five patients were evaluated by sonography, four by CT, three by angiography, and two by MR imaging. There was evidence of compression of adjacent viscera by six of the seven pelvic tumors with associated hydronephrosis in one patient. One thigh lesion had focal areas of speckled calcification. All five neoplasms evaluated by sonography showed a well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion and three had significant sound through-transmission. Hypervascularity was documented by contrast-enhanced CT or angiography in each of three patients in whom these procedures were performed. Surgical resection of the pelvic neoplasms was complicated by marked hemorrhage. Hemangiopericytoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of well-circumscribed hypervascular tumors in a middle-aged patient.\r"

The appearance of these lesions on cranial sonography is often unusual and may be confusing. We compared the findings at autopsy with premorbid cranial sonograms in 17 nonsurviving neonates to define better the anatomic basis for the sonographic appearance of these lesions. Macroscopic abnormalities were identified at autopsy in 13 of the 17 neonates. Five neonates had multifocal hemorrhagic white-matter infarcts, three had large parenchymal hemorrhages with adjacent areas of parenchymal necrosis, three had hemorrhagic infarcts of the cerebellum, one had a germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage, and one had bilateral periventricular cysts with surrounding gliosis. All 17 neonates had abnormalities on microscopic examination. Although sonography was accurate in the detection of macroscopic lesions (11 of 13 lesions detected with sonography), the nature and extent of these abnormalities were difficult to judge because of the variable echogenicity of unclotted blood and the presence of focal areas of abnormal echogenicity associated with microscopic calcification and gliosis. Sonography is excellent for the detection of acute cerebrovascular complications during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, but the appearance of these lesions is variable and nonspecific.\r"

  ".U": "89320288\r", 
  ".W": "The 3 to 5-year clinical outcomes of 627 consecutive patients selected for treatment with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at Emory University Hospital for one- or two-vessel coronary artery disease with involvement of the left anterior descending coronary artery, between July 1981 and June 1983, and 865 patients in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study with similar coronary artery disease involvement selected for medical therapy between 1975 and 1979 were compared. Cox analyses and stratified life table analyses were used to adjust for differences in 13 variables including concurrent medical therapy. Complete follow-up was obtained in 97% of PTCA patients and 99% of medically treated patients. After correction for baseline differences in significantly predictive variables, there was no difference between the relative risk of death after PTCA vs medical therapy (RR = 0.7; p = 0.36). However, results of analysis of prospectively defined subsets showed a potential survival benefit after PTCA for patients with an ejection fraction less than 50% (RR = 0.2; p = 0.02) and also for patients with two-vessel disease (RR = 0.2; p = 0.04). For the groups as a whole there was no difference in risk of infarction after PTCA and medical therapy (RR = 0.8; p = 0.58). However, for patients with 90% to 99% LAD stenosis there was a trend toward lessened risk of infarction after PTCA (RR = 0.6; p = 0.15). No patient subset had a higher risk of death or infarction with PTCA (p less than or equal to 0.15). The likelihood of later surgery was increased after PTCA (RR = 1.5; p = 0.002). Angina, employment, and activity levels were improved after PTCA. Thus PTCA compared to medical therapy was associated with improved functional status and may decrease the risk of death and infarction in certain patient subsets. However, bypass surgery was more often performed in patients initially treated with PTCA. These data should be interpreted in light of their nonrandomized study origin and generation from different clinical sites.\r"

A stepwise Cox regression analysis identified congestive heart failure score, left ventricular contraction score, mitral regurgitation, age, and digitalis usage as independent variables predictive of 8-year survival. When patients were stratified by left ventricular contraction score, the 8-year survival rate was 62%, 49%, and 19%, respectively, for patients with a left ventricular score of 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and greater than or equal to 15 (p less than 0.0001). The presence of a stenosis greater than or equal to 70% in the right coronary artery was associated with worse survival (47% versus 54% at 8 years; p = 0.051). In conclusion, the diagnosis of combined proximal left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery disease represents a large prognostic spectrum that needs to be considered when counselling individual patients.\r"

Abnormal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), ejection fraction (EF), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-volume ratio (R) were the most prevalent hemodynamic abnormalities (27%, 14%, and 23%, respectively, at 1 year). Patients with abnormal LVEDP or R had higher (p less than 0.05) mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP). During follow-up, hemodynamic abnormalities disappeared in some patients while they developed in some others. Transplant patients with abnormal LVEDP, EF, or R at 1 year who normalized at 2 years had a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in MAP. Likewise, patients with normal LVEDP, EF, or R at 1 year who subsequently developed abnormalities had a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in MAP. The presence of hemodynamic abnormalities at 1 year was not associated with a poorer survival (mean follow-up 2.6 +/- 1.1 years). In summary, hemodynamic abnormalities in asymptomatic transplant recipients taking cyclosporine and prednisone appear to be related to the level of post-transplant hypertension and do not signify an adverse prognosis over the first 3 years.\r"

  ".W": "Recent findings concerning the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction are reviewed and related to the potential for myocardial salvage. The myocardial infarction process can be divided into 2 phases, an early evolving phase (the first 6 hours) and a later convalescent phase. An evolving infarction is associated with an occluded coronary artery; in most cases, a thrombotic occlusion occurs. The human coronary artery normally has an intact endothelium, which has protective vasodilatory and antiplatelet-aggregating effects that are lost when the endothelium is damaged. The endothelium is exquisitely sensitive to trauma and can be damaged by high shear stress produced by narrowing of the coronary arteries that is not associated with reduced coronary blood flow. In addition, during this acute endothelial damage, monocellular infiltration of the coronary arteries has the potential to release factors that may cause platelet aggregation, enhance blood coagulation, attract other white blood cells or exert other effects on the coronary tree. Myocardial damage occurring in the early evolving stage is usually responsive to treatment that either restores myocardial oxygen supply or reduces myocardial oxygen demand. However, coronary events occurring after the first 6 hours usually are not responsive to such treatment. Certain clinical variables may shorten or extend the time period within which damaged myocardium can be saved. The findings suggest important approaches for intervention to modify the acute phase.\r"

Administration of a beta blocker within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission to the coronary care unit can reduce overall morbidity and mortality within the first 7 days by about 15%. Maintenance therapy with an oral beta blocker can reduce mortality within the succeeding 3 years by about 25%. Esmolol, a unique cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker with a half-life of 9 minutes, can enable some patients with relative contraindications to beta blockers to nevertheless benefit from early beta-blocking therapy. It also is useful in screening patients for subsequent therapy with beta blockers. Those who tolerate the esmolol infusion can be given a long-acting beta blocker. For patients who exhibit intolerance to esmolol, the infusion can be terminated with rapid return to baseline hemodynamics.\r"

  ".U": "89320337\r", 
  ".W": "The antithrombotic approach to patients with acute myocardial infarction in the prevention of venous, left ventricular and coronary artery thromboembolic events should be based on an understanding of pathogenesis and risk. Coronary thrombotic events involve conditions of high shear rate present in areas of vessel stenosis or disrupted atherosclerotic plaque, which lead to activation of both platelets and the coagulation system, and are best prevented by platelet inhibitors alone or in combination with an anticoagulant. However, thromboembolism that originates in the venous system or cardiac chambers is related to situations of blood stasis and low shear rate, which predominantly result in clotting activation and fibrin-thrombus formation and are best approached with anticoagulant therapy. For prevention of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, early mobilization is essential and should be supplemented by low-dose heparin in patients at high risk, including the elderly and those with large infarcts, heart failure or previous thromboembolic events. For prevention of left ventricular mural thrombosis and systemic embolism, high-dose heparinization is indicated in patients with large infarcts, particularly in the anterior location and in those with heart failure. Subsequently, warfarin therapy should be considered for patients at high embolic risk, including those with echocardiographic evidence of mobile and protruding thrombi, severe left ventricular dysfunction or prior emboli. In patients with acute infarction, aspirin is recommended for preventing coronary reocclusion and reinfarction. Although anticoagulants may also be of benefit for this purpose, their use is still controversial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During five years the authors observed 83 patients with generalized DAD in 827 adult autopsies (10.1%) and 10 patients with identical, but localized, lesions. The authors propose the term regional alveolar damage (RAD) to designate localized \"DAD.\" RAD was unilateral in six patients and most frequently involved the upper lobe. All ten patients had chronic systemic diseases and presented with life-threatening illnesses. The probable causes of RAD were multifactorial and included hypotensive shock, septicemia, pneumonia, hyperoxia, and pancreatitis. All patients developed respiratory failure, requiring supplemental oxygen and, in nine patients, mechanical ventilation. Chest roentgenograms revealed alveolar or combined alveolar and interstitial infiltrates that corresponded to the lesions found at autopsy. The reasons for localization of RAD within the lung are unclear, but the presence of proliferative lesions and frequent involvement of the upper lobe suggests that RAD is not simply an early phase of DAD and implicates additional pathogenetic factors.\r"

Sensitivity was evaluated by determining the highest useful dilution of polyclonal antiglucagon antibodies applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human pancreas. Detection efficiency was evaluated by tabulation of the total number of positive (three or more positive cells) islets. On direct comparison, the LAB method exceeded the PAP and ABC methods in both sensitivity and detection efficiency, which were essentially equal. Titration of linking antiserum of the PAP method boosted its sensitivity and detection efficiency above that of ABC; the PAP had equal sensitivity to the LAB and exceeded it in detection efficiency. The authors conclude that comparisons of immunohistologic methods are meaningful only if both sensitivity and efficiency are considered along with the unique requirements of any single method.\r"

The clinical findings and the outcome of the current and the reported cases are analyzed. All patients were immunocompromised. CMV infection, when detected in the skin, appears to be associated with grave prognosis. Seventeen of 20 patients whose final outcome was recorded died within six months after the onset of CMV skin lesions. The outcome of one case is unknown. The mortality was 85%. The fatal cases had either concurrent disseminated CMV infection or mixed cutaneous or systemic infections. When the infection is localized in the skin wounds, the prognosis seems fairly good.

  ".W": "The administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells to patients with advanced metastatic cancer has yielded encouraging results. The purported ability of LAK cells to be discriminatively tumoricidal, thus sparing normal host tissue, represents a major advance over conventional chemotherapy. However, IL-2 adoptive immunotherapy results in dose-limiting toxicity characterized by weight gain, dyspnea, ascites, and peripheral-pulmonary edema suggestive of a vascular leak syndrome. It is unclear whether the observed toxicity is directly related to IL-2 and/or LAK cells. The authors examined the cytolytic nature of human LAK cells against human endothelial, epithelial, and fibroblast cell lines. Bovine endothelial cells also were studied. Using a 51Cr release assay, the cytolytic potential, time course, and effect of reactive oxygen intermediate inhibitors were studied. LAK cells were uniformly toxic against all cell lines, in contrast to high dose rIL-2 and excipient. Significant cytolysis was observed within 30 minutes and increased over the first 2 hours of LAK cells coming in contact with target cells. Reactive oxygen intermediate inhibitors did not reduce cytolytic activity. The authors thus found human LAK cells to be rapidly cytolytic against a variety of human and bovine cell lines. This cytolysis was independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.\r"

  ".W": "In a 1902 American Journal of the Medical Sciences case report, Riesman described \"albuminous expectoration\" following thoracentesis, a phenomenon that is now recognized as re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE). Both cellular and biochemical mechanisms that produce lung injury in RPE have been described recently. Pathophysiologically, this unilateral edematous lung injury resembles the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because both are characterized by intra-alveolar-activated neutrophils and markedly increased lung capillary permeability. Biochemical mechanisms that operate in RPE are analogous to those in diverse re-oxygenation (reperfusion) injuries that have been described recently in the heart, kidney, brain, and intestine. Re-oxygenated lung tissue appears to produce excess superoxide and other cytotoxic oxygen metabolites, although lung xanthine oxidase, the commonly recognized source of these oxidants, is exceedingly low. Riesman's critical analyses of the re-expansion edema fluid in his case provided an impetus for others to hypothesize that increased permeability pulmonary edema in RPE represented re-oxygenation injury of the lung microvasculature.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution, real-time sonography can be used to assess the size and location of the parathyroid glands. The authors review the types of information provided by sonography and outline the ways in which it contributes to the management of primary hyperparathyroidism. Sonography usually can differentiate parathyroid adenoma from hyperplasia. In milder cases, with less parathyroid enlargement, this differentiation is difficult but can be facilitated by determining three dimensions for each gland. Preoperative knowledge of the presumptive location of an adenoma is most useful when the strategy of unilateral neck exploration is to be used because it will allow the exploration always to begin on the correct side. Sonographic evidence of hyperplasia should trigger a preoperative search for multiple endocrine neoplasia and will alert the surgeon that a bilateral neck exploration and thymectomy will be needed. A more universal benefit is the ability to predict or exclude intrathyroidal and subcapsular parathyroid tumors, thus guiding the decision for thyroid versus thymic exploration in the event of a missing abnormal gland. Sonography often fails to visualize parathyroid tumors in an ectopic position away from the thyroid bed. Such tumors, however, may be anticipated when the sonogram shows only three enlarged glands in cases of hyperplasia, or only three glands of normal size in a patient with strong biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism. Because it is noninvasive and inexpensive and can provide a wealth of information, the authors have adopted sonography as a routine preoperative procedure for primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

To avoid unfavorable effects of oligohydramnios on fetal development and well-being, we infused physiologic saline solution continuously into the amniotic cavity at a flow rate of 10 to 20 ml/hr with a new cervical indwelling catheter (PROM-fence). As a result the average pocket size of amniotic cavity was 2.7 cm before amnioinfusion, 5.9 cm 1 day after, 5.8 cm 5 days after, and 5.0 cm 10 days after amnioinfusion. The saline solution amnioinfusion made it possible to keep the amniotic cavity fluid level adequate. Variable deceleration disappeared in one case. No side effects such as uterine contractions were observed. We recommend the method of saline solution amnioinfusion for its favorable effects on fetal environment during management of premature rupture of membranes.\r"

Among them, 110 pregnancies (26.2% of the total) delivered before 37 completed weeks of gestation compared with a 9.7% incidence (906/9368) for the general population at the Brigham and Women's Hospital during calendar year 1985. Thirty-three percent of all premature deliveries were the result of the development of preeclampsia. The relative risk of prematurity for diabetic patients with any hypertensive complication was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.40 to 2.87) compared with normotensive diabetic subjects. Compared with the general population, most of the excess risk of prematurity was confined to hypertensive diabetics and normotensive patients of more advanced White class. A history of having had a previous premature delivery, increasing duration of diabetes antedating pregnancy, and carrying a male fetus in the index pregnancy were significantly associated with premature delivery. Future efforts to reduce the incidence of prematurity among diabetic gravidas should be directed toward reducing the incidence of preeclampsia.\r"

Three hundred seventy-four patients completed the study, 189 in the placebo group and 185 in the treatment group.

There were no significant differences in either systolic or diastolic blood pressures between both groups either at time of enrollment or at subsequent gestational ages later during pregnancy. Analysis of variance for repeated measurements and Fisher's least significant difference testing indicated a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in blood pressure from the level at the time of enrollment to the level achieved at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation in each group. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding any of the following parameters: incidences of preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, preterm labor, birth weight, gestational age at delivery, or number of infants admitted to the special care unit.

The increased resolution of the transvaginally introduced high-frequency ultrasound transducer probes seems to solve this diagnostic problem. In this study 145 patients were referred for ultrasonographic workup because of a suspected ectopic gestation. In 38 patients a diagnosis could be made with classical transabdominal scanning. One hundred seventeen patients required additional transvaginal scanning with a 5.0 and a 6.5 MHz probe. In 98 patients a diagnosis was made during the first transvaginal scan; nine patients were rescanned within 3 days for the final diagnosis. In 56 patients, ectopic pregnancy was successfully ruled out by transvaginal scanning. Thirty-nine ectopic pregnancies were diagnosed. Only one false-positive identification was made. The sensitivity of diagnosing ectopic pregnancy by high-frequency transvaginal sonography was 100%; the specificity was 98.2%. The positive predictive value of this method was 98%, and the negative predictive value was 100%. The rate of the beating fetal heart was seen in the tube (23%). The high number of unruptured tubal pregnancies in this series (66%) suggests the possibility of an early diagnosis that may have therapeutic implications. The use of higher-frequency transvaginal transducer probes improves the diagnosis of the ectopic gestation.\r"

The authors review the clinical literature that serves as the conceptual basis for this diagnosis. The development of the diagnostic criteria is described, including the rationale for specific criteria and the objections raised by opponents of the category. The authors describe how some of these objections led to changes in the diagnostic criteria in an attempt to distinguish self-defeating personality disorder from normal reactions to victimization and abuse.\r"

Anorexia nervosa is associated with changes in the noradrenergic, serotonergic, and opioid systems; bulimia nervosa is accompanied by marked alterations in serotonin and norepinephrine activity. These neurochemical changes may perpetuate pathological eating behavior and may be responsible for several associated psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety and depression. The authors also summarize studies of several drugs that are used in the treatment of eating disorders and are known to modify neurotransmitter activity. Understanding the neurochemistry of eating disorders seems crucial for the rational development of both psychopharmacological and behavioral treatments.\r"

Plasma catecholamines were in the high ranges, similar in both groups at 0 and 3 hr, but after 5 hr P greater than L for norepinephrine (but not epinephrine or dopamine).

  ".W": "Many classes of CNS-acting drugs have been suggested to act at least partially via inhibition of adenosine uptake. Synaptosomal uptake of [3H]adenosine and the effect of acute ethanol on it were studied in a rat brain area known to be involved in the coordination and modulation of normal motor activity, the cerebellum. Uptake of [3H]adenosine was found to be linear with time (about 40 sec) and increasing concentrations (up to 1.5 microM) of adenosine. The uptake of [3H]adenosine was inhibited by dilazep (IC50 = 2.5 x 10(-7) M) in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacologically and/or toxicologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (2.5 to 100 mM) significantly inhibited the uptake of [3H]adenosine between 12 and 15%. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that both in vitro (25 mM) and in vivo (1.5 g/kg i.p.; 30 mM blood level) ethanol lowered Km as well as Vmax values for adenosine uptake to nearly the same extent. In the case of in vivo ethanol, no ethanol was present during the assay since synaptosome preparation would wash out residual ethanol. The results of the present study indicate possible membranal alterations by in vivo ethanol. It is concluded that the uptake of [3H]adenosine is inhibited by intoxicating concentrations of ethanol in vitro and by acute ethanol (1.5 g/kg) in vivo. This may partially explain the modulatory role of endogenous adenosine in ethanol-induced motor disturbances.\r"

The manner in which environmental factors interact in these genetically selected animals to influence ethanol consumption has not been thoroughly investigated. Using the alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) line of rats selectively bred at the Indiana University School of Medicine, alcohol self-administration in an operant situation was initiated using either a sucrose-fading or a secondary-conditioning procedure. These initiation procedures do not require any food or fluid restriction. Initiation was successful in 10 out of 12 NP animals, with the initiated rats self-administering ethanol at concentrations as high as 40%. Following initiation, a retest of home-cage ethanol preference found increases in ethanol acceptability. When tested in a concurrent operant situation, the initiated NP rats also chose ethanol over water. However, the NP rats had lower alcohol intakes and a different pattern of drinking over time when compared to that of nonselected Long-Evans rats. While the NP rats could be initiated to lever-press for ethanol, at no time did their intake approach that of the selected line of alcohol-preferring (P) rats. Thus, while an upward shift from the genetic baseline in ethanol preference and intake can result from the environmental initiation manipulations employed in these studies, genetic factors would appear to limit the extent to which ethanol ingestion can be increased.\r"

Twelve alcoholic subjects and twelve moderate drinkers participated in a single experimental session consisting of randomized presentations of three types of stimulus trials. Each trial included gustatory and visual presentation of alcohol, pepper juice (as a control for stimulus intensity) or water. Both alcohol and pepper juice stimuli significantly increased heart rate and skin conductance responses as compared with water stimuli. In contrast, subjects significantly increased self-report ratings of high and feel different following alcohol stimuli only. Physiological and subjective responses were similar in alcoholics and social drinkers with the exception of significantly higher self-reported craving in alcoholic subjects. These findings suggest that stimulus intensity contributes to the magnitude of physiological but not subjective responses to alcohol-related stimuli.\r"

Individual subjects participated in five successive daily sessions consisting of randomized-block presentations of gustatory and visual presentation of alcohol, pepper juice (as a control for stimulus taste intensity), or water stimuli. Following the stimulus trial series, all subjects ingested 1.5 oz of alcohol in a shot glass. Twelve subjects next received a 1.7 g/kg alcohol drink (\"high dose alcohol group\") on Days 1-4 and placebo on Day 5, and 12 subjects received a placebo drink on all study Days (1-5) (\"placebo drink group\"). On Day 1, alcohol stimuli generally elicited larger heart rate and skin conductance increases and skin temperature decreases than water or pepper juice stimuli. Alcohol stimuli also elicited greater subjective responses than either pepper juice or water. Alcohol availability within the taste trial markedly increased physiological and subjective reactivity to alcohol-related stimuli, perhaps due to the closer approximation to natural drinking behavior. A comparison with previous data from this laboratory suggests that prestudy deprivation from alcohol, instructions to expect alcohol, a conductive drink setting, and the opportunity to drink alcohol within the session may enhance reactivity to alcohol stimuli in alcoholics.\r"

We previously described considerable underreporting of alcohol use during pregnancy, particularly among problem drinkers. This report is of the relationship between severity of drinking problems and the magnitude of underreporting. Pregnant disadvantaged women responded to the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) at the first antenatal visit and provided self-report data regarding alcohol use at each antenatal visit. Five years later, 238 of these women again provided self-report information about drinking during the target pregnancy. Underreporting was defined as a positive difference between the indices computed from the retrospective and the in-pregnancy data. The relationship of underreporting to the MAST score was highly significant and indicated a 20-fold increase in underreporting from the lowest to highest MAST score. However, the marked individual variability seen in this relationship indicates that while the MAST may be a better indicator of risk than self-reports of drinking, it is also not sufficient for the purpose. Further work examining other measures and techniques for obtaining drinking information is indicated.\r"

Male (n = 50) and female (n = 46) rats were administered 2.5 g/kg ethanol (i.p.) and the blood-ethanol concentration (BEC) at the time of regain of aerial righting reflex (RARR) was measured. The rats were then placed in inhalation chambers for 8 consecutive days and chronically exposed to ethanol. Thirty-two hours following the cessation of chronic ethanol exposure, the rats were again given a 2.5 g/kg dose of ethanol and the BEC at RARR was again measured. The amount of chronic ethanol tolerance developed, as measured by the difference in BEC at RARR prior to and after chronic ethanol administration, was widely and normally distributed for both male and female rats. Control rats, which did not receive chronic ethanol exposure between the two tests of RARR, did not show tolerance on this measure. A negative correlation (r = -0.46) was found between BEC at RARR prior to chronic ethanol treatment and the amount of chronic tolerance developed using the difference in BEC measure. This correlation suggested that the rats who were initially more sensitive to the effects of ethanol were more likely to display the greatest amount of chronic tolerance. However, using the residuals of the regression analysis of post-chronic ethanol BEC at RARR on prechronic BEC at RARR as an index of tolerance, this negative correlation was not found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of ethanol (ETOH) is known to increase the cytosolic NADH/NAD ratio and consequently impairs hepatic glucose output in the fasted state. In contrast, one of the characteristic alterations in glucose metabolism produced by the administration of endotoxin is an increase in the de novo synthesis of glucose. Therefore, the present study tests the hypothesis that the acute administration of ETOH will prevent the endotoxin-induced increase in glucose production. In vivo glucose kinetics were determined by the infusion of [6-3H, U-14C]glucose in catheterized conscious rats. The intravenous infusion of tracer glucose, and ETOH (100 mg/100 g b.w./hr) or saline were started at the same time and both continued throughout the experiment. Two hours later the ETOH infusion rate was decreased to maintain the blood ETOH levels between 100 and 160 mg/dl. At 140 min, endotoxin (100 micrograms/100 g b.w.) was injected. ETOH alone did not alter basal values of plasma glucose (5 mM), glucose rate of appearance (Ra; 35 mumols/min/kg) or metabolic clearance (MCR; 7 ml/min/kg). Endotoxin alone increased plasma glucose (80%) and lactate (140%) concentrations, glucose Ra (60%) and recycling (40%) in saline-infused rats, whereas in ETOH-infused animals, plasma glucose and lactate levels were only elevated 40% and glucose Ra and recycling were unchanged. The results show that acute ETOH administration diminishes the increased glucose production and utilization seen in endotoxemia. The attenuation of the endotoxin effect by ethanol is due to inhibition of hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose utilization.\r"

Subjects received placebo, 0.32, 0.65, and 0.81 g alcohol/kg body weight prior to their evening bedtime, with each dose given on one of four nonconsecutive nights in a repeated-measures counterbalanced design. On each night, respiration was assessed by recording respiratory effort from intercostal surface electromyography (EMG), ventilation from oral and nasal thermistors, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) from an ear oximeter (BIOX III). Snorers had significantly: (a) more total SDB, (b) more obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and (c) lower minimum SaO2 than nonsnorers after the placebo and each alcohol dose. Snorers had more hypoxic events than nonsnorers after each alcohol dose but not after placebo. Increasing alcohol dose caused a statistically significant (p = 0.0004) decrease in minimum SaO2 in snorers only, but this decrease was small and probably not clinically important. Alcohol did not cause significant increases in SDB and hypoxic events, and did not have different effects on SDB and hypoxic events for snorers versus nonsnorers. Because this experiment included only nonobese 30-49-year-old males, these results do not imply that alcohol has no significant effects on obese subjects or those older than 50.\r"

We tested this hypothesis by examining the correlation between ethanol and pentobarbital sedative effects in individual animals from a genetically heterogeneous population. The duration of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis (sleep-time) was unrelated to the sleep-time produced by ethanol in heterogeneous stock (HS) mice. Therefore, the present study also examined the effect of ethanol, pentobarbital, and flunitrazepam on muscimol-stimulated chloride flux into brain membranes prepared from HS mice selected for differences in pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced sleep-time. Brain membranes from mice selected for differences in ethanol sleep-time were differentially responsive to ethanol- and flunitrazepam-, but not to pentobarbital-induced augmentation of muscimol-stimulated chloride flux. No differences in augmentation of chloride flux by ethanol, pentobarbital, or flunitrazepam were found in membranes prepared from mice differentially sensitive to pentobarbital hypnosis. The ability of muscimol to stimulate chloride uptake was not related to ethanol or pentobarbital sensitivity. These findings suggest that sensitivity to ethanol is not likely to be genetically linked to pentobarbital sensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "89321009\r", 
  ".W": "Several reports indicate that acute ethanol promotes the cleavage of brain sialoglycoconjugates (SGC). We attempted to confirm this effect by monitoring cleavage of sialic acid (SA) that had been radiolabeled by pretreatment with the specific precursor of SA, N-[3H]acetyl-D-mannosamine, injected intracerebroventricularly into rats 20 h prior to ethanol injection (2 or 3 g/kg, given four times in a simulated \"binge drinking\" protocol). Analysis of the residual labeled material revealed a significant reduction of radiolabel (p less than 0.01), as compared to saline controls. A dose of 3 g/kg diminished the total labeled SGC by half. Brain sialidase activity was not affected by the ethanol treatment. Since ethanol intoxication is associated with enhanced SA cleavage, one hypothesis needing testing is that loss of SA might help to cause intoxication. If so, pretreatment with SA might antagonize intoxication, presumably by offsetting loss due to cleavage of SA. Consistent with our earlier results, we found that when sialic acid was given i.p. (25 mg/kg), 1, 6, or 24 h prior to ethanol injection (4 g/kg, i.p.), the sleep time was reduced by 35-40% and the performance on rotorod was significantly enhanced (p less than 0.01). When ethanol was replaced by pentobarbital (40 mg/kg), the sleep time was increased (approximately 30%) at 6 h after injection with either 25 or 100 mg/kg sialic acid, whereas at the 24 h postinjection it was decreased (approximately 20%) at both doses. The results suggest that sialic acid is a key component in mediating ethanol effects and perhaps also, in a different way, anesthetic effects.\r"

Immune responsiveness was measured by T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogenic stimulation with Con A (3 micrograms/ml) in spleen and thymus cells of 21-old-day male rats who were exposed to alcohol in utero. The proliferative response was 8-fold lower in spleen and twofold lower in thymus cells from alcohol-exposed animals compared to responses measured in control rats. Thymus weight was significantly smaller at birth in alcohol exposed males, but significantly larger at 21 days of age compared to controls. Alterations in the content of ACTH and CRF, hormones, known to be direct or indirect modulators of immune responsiveness, were also observed in alcohol exposed males. Hypothalamic content of CRF and pituitary content of ACTH were significantly lower in alcohol exposed males on postnatal Day 1, but hypothalamic ACTH content was significantly higher compared to controls. These results indicate that alcohol exposure during the last week of gestation can produce alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in addition to teratogenic effects on the immune system which have been previously observed only with a much longer alcohol exposure regimen.\r"

In order to avoid this kind of interference, peripheral lymphocytes from 12 chronic alcoholic patients in good nutritional status and without heavy liver damage and 15 healthy controls were examined in this study. Lymphocyte functional activity was evaluated by means of response to phytohemagglutinin, calcium ionophore A 23187, and autologous non-T-cells [autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR)]. Phenotypical analysis was carried out by the indirect immunofluorescence technique using monoclonal antibodies specific to CD5 (mature T-lymphocytes), CD4 (helper/inducer T-lymphocytes), CD8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), glycoproteins, and an immunoglobulin fraction from rabbit directed to membrane alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) that is involved in T-cell activation process. Our results show significant impairment in AMLR while response to phytohemagglutinin, heterologous non-T-cells and carcinoma ionophore did not differ from controls. No differences were present in circulating T-lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD4, and CD8 on their membrane, whereas AGP-bearing lymphocytes were significantly lower in chronic alcoholics (14.4 +/- 8.6) than in controls (31.9 +/- 8.1; p less than 0.001). These results support the hypothesis of a direct action of alcohol on one of the pathways of lymphocyte activation and the role of the lymphocyte membrane AGP on the AMLR.\r"

They were interviewed about their alcohol use before the treatment period and bimonthly for 8 months after it. It was found that the correlations between laboratory markers and average daily alcohol intake are very low (range, -0.01-0.23) in alcoholics with high alcoholic intake level (before the treatment period). It was also found that the correlations between the laboratory tests and the drinking measures after the initial assessment undergo large changes. The correlation between GGT and average daily alcohol intake before the treatment period was 0.07 (p = NS) and 2 months after the treatment period 0.55 (p less than 0.001). The long period of abstinence, the change to a lower level of alcohol consumption, and improved accuracy of reporting alcohol intake were probably causative in this change. GGT proved to have the highest correlations with the drinking measures during the follow-up and MCV before the treatment period. The frequency measure, number of drinking days, gave consistently higher correlations with the laboratory markers than the measure of drinking amount, average daily alcohol intake. Laboratory markers, GGT and MCV, are well suited for outcome evaluation of drinking behavior of alcoholics after inpatient treatment for alcoholism or other comparative periods of abstinence.\r"

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of varying doses of oral ethanol on total serum calcium. Fifteen adult mongrel dogs (17-25 kg) were divided into three groups which differed in the dosage of ethanol given. Group I animals received 0.5 g/kg of ethanol; Group II, 1.0 g/kg ethanol; and Group III, 2.0 g/kg of ethanol. Venous blood was sampled for estimation of concentrations of total serum calcium and ethanol. In the animals in Group I, serum calcium levels were unchanged by the ethanol. In both Groups II and III, significant reductions in serum calcium were demonstrated, which occurred within 5 min of intoxication. The mean decrease in serum calcium in Group III animals was significantly greater than that in either Group I and II. We conclude that the rapid hypocalcemic effect requires a threshold amount of ethanol before it becomes chemically evident. This critical value in dogs approximated 1 g/kg which results in a mean peak serum alcohol concentration of 117 +/- 6 mg/dl.\r"

No significant changes were found in liver aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, plasma levels of thyroxine, testosterone, or estradiol, or brain or liver histology. Plasma growth hormone concentrations were about 60% lower in the experimental group than in controls, but this effect of previous thiamine deprivation did not correlate with changes in ADH activity. Therefore, it remains to be elucidated how thiamine deficiency-induced central nervous system alterations may contribute to the development of metabolic tolerance to ethanol.\r"

Eye vapor measurements were transposed into blood alcohol concentrations and compared with concentrations obtained by gas chromatographic analysis of blood. The correlation of concentrations obtained by the two methods yielded correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.95 depending on the calculation used. Eye vapor response and blood alcohol concentration were also found to be highly correlated (r = 0.96) after alcohol administration to mice and sampling for 2.5 hr after ethanol administration. Kinetic profiles obtained by eye vapor analysis and gas chromatography are virtually identical. The method described allows widespread use of a new, noninvasive approach to alcohol analysis in laboratory animals.\r"

For a best least squares fit for phi, aortic diameters can be calibrated over a range of 22-37 mm. The calibration was then tested in a separate group of patients using the same empirically derived angle to calculate cardiac outputs. The transtracheal Doppler cardiac outputs show good correlation with those obtained by thermodilution over a range of cardiac outputs, 2.69-8.62 1/min, R2 = 0.835.\r"

Preoperatively, PT and aPTT were moderately prolonged (1.5 times control), and platelet count was greater than 100,000/mm3 in all patients but one (91,000/mm3). During the preanhepatic and anhepatic stages, PT, aPTT, reaction time, and coagulation time improved toward normal values, but platelet count and maximum amplitude did not change. Significant changes in coagulation occurred on reperfusion of the grafted liver: PT, aPTT, reaction time, and coagulation time were prolonged, and platelet count, maximum amplitude, and clot formation rate decreased. A heparin effect, which did not require treatment, was seen on reperfusion in four patients. Fibrinolysis occurred during the operation in five patients and was treated with Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) in one. Blood coagulation improved slowly, and values were close to baseline 90 min after reperfusion. In general, the coagulation changes seen in these children are similar to those in adults but less severe, possibly because of the preponderance of cholestatic disease in children compared with the more common hepatocellular disease in adults.\r"

To this end, systemic hypothermia has been reported to reduce oxygen consumption. Cooling, however, may antagonize hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and depress cardiac output. To determine whether these potentially adverse effects of cooling on tissue oxygen delivery would outweigh any potential benefits, we studied the effects of systemic hypothermia and end-expiratory pressure on venous admixture, intrapulmonary blood distribution, and oxygenation variables in 40 dogs with oleic acid-induced pulmonary edema of the right lung. The dogs were randomly assigned to four treatment groups of 10 dogs each: normothermia and zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP); normothermia and 10 cm H2O PEEP; hypothermia and ZEEP; hypothermia and PEEP. Hypothermia to 31.9 +/- 0.1 degree C (mean +/- SEM) caused no adverse effects on intrapulmonary blood flow distribution (measured by radioactive microspheres) or on venous admixture. Tissue oxygen delivery and arterial oxygenation did not improve with hypothermia, the latter being 109 +/- 13 mm Hg and 70 +/- 8 mm Hg with PEEP and ZEEP, respectively. However, hypothermia significantly reduced oxygen consumption, so that the coefficient of oxygen delivery (i.e., the ratio of oxygen supply to consumption) increased from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 (p less than 0.01) with ZEEP and from 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 with PEEP (p = 0.016). Thus, although systemic hypothermia failed to improve arterial oxygenation and tissue oxygen delivery, it decreased systemic oxygen demands, thereby improving the oxygen supply-demand balance.\r"

To study this relationship, spirometry and methacholine challenge testing (MCT) were performed on 18 active Seattle firefighters before and 5 to 24 h after firefighting. Body plethysmography was used to measure changes in specific airway conductance (SGaw), and results of MCT were analyzed using PD35-SGaw, the cumulative dose causing a 35% decrease in SGaw. Subjects who did not react by the end of the protocol were assigned a value of 640 inhalational units, the largest cumulative dose. Fire exposure was defined as the total time (hours) spent without a self-contained breathing apparatus at the firesite and was categorized as mild (less than 1 h, n = 7), moderate (1 to 2 h, n = 5), or severe (greater than 2 h, n = 6). Mean age of the 18 firefighters was 36.7 +/- 6.7 yr (range, 25 to 51), with a mean of 9.1 +/- 7.9 active years in the trade (range, zero to 22). None was known to be asthmatic.

All clinically asymptomatic and functionally normal subjects underwent methacholine challenge. The distribution of responsiveness to methacholine (as expressed by LnPD15FEV1) was found to be significantly different between these normal smokers and nonsmokers. A multinomial logistic regression model showed a statistically significant difference in the response to the challenge on the basis of pack-years. When the number of years of smoking and the daily number of cigarettes were separately considered, the current amount had the significant correlation with LnPD15FEV1. Bronchial reactivity for past smokers was found not to be different from that for normal nonsmokers. We conclude that smoking habits, especially current habits, affect bronchial reactivity even in the absence of airway obstruction.\r"

  ".U": "89321164\r", 
  ".W": "Although the information that has been reviewed leaves many questions unanswered, some conclusions can be drawn from available data. (1) Smoking appears to increase the risk of sensitization to certain inhaled antigens encountered in the workplace; however, there is no definite evidence that smoking increases the frequency or intensity of allergy to common aeroallergens in the general population. On average, smokers have higher serum total IgE concentrations and blood eosinophil counts than do nonsmokers, but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are not clear. Analysis of these relationships is complicated by observations suggesting that atopic persons are less likely to become and to remain regular cigarette smokers. (2) Long-term cigarette smoking may be associated with increased nonspecific airway responsiveness, although the magnitude of this effect is relatively small when one adjusts for prechallenge level of pulmonary function. This effect of smoking may be more pronounced in atopic persons. (3) Atopy, as assessed by skin testing and serum IgE concentrations, is associated with asthma, nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness, and reduced pulmonary function level in population data. However, there is no clear evidence that atopy is a risk factor for irreversible airflow obstruction in persons without asthma. Population data do not indicate how much of the reduction in pulmonary function associated with atopy and asthma is potentially reversible. (4) Blood eosinophil count appears inversely related to the level of pulmonary function and directly related to the rate of decline of pulmonary function among nonsmokers. Reports vary concerning whether the relationship of eosinophil count to level of pulmonary function remains after excluding subjects with diagnosed asthma. This relationship may be determined largely by a clinically distinguishable subset of nonsmokers with \"asthmatic bronchitis.\" Presumably, these observations reflect an adverse impact of eosinophilic inflammation in the airways or lung parenchyma. It is not clear whether this represents an allergic response because skin-test reactivity to common aeroallergens and serum total IgE concentration do not show similar relationships to reduced level and rapid decline of pulmonary function. (5) Among smokers, nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness appears to be associated with an accelerated longitudinal decline of pulmonary function, although most studies indicating this association are limited by either a retrospective design or lack of adjustment for prechallenge level of pulmonary function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ventilators can impose resistive and elastic loads during subject-initiated and spontaneous breaths. Such loads might worsen the chest wall distortion that is characteristic of patients with flail chest. We have tested this expectation in nine patients with flail chest and four normal subjects. All subjects breathed for 3 to 5 min on each of the following modes: assist control, intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), continuous positive airway pressure 5 to 10 cm H2O by demand valve and by a high flow system (CPAP-HF), and spontaneously (T-piece). Pressure at the airway opening was evaluated as a measure of ventilator loading, and magnetometric displacements of the major chest wall dimensions were evaluated to assess chest wall distortion. In contrast to the normal volunteers, patients with flail chest displayed chest wall distortion during active inspirations. The patterns of distortion were variable among patients. The degree of distortion varied among ventilator modes; generally, there was a greater degree of chest wall distortion in breaths with greater loading. For example, distortion was greater during the spontaneous breaths taken on the IMV-mode than during spontaneous breaths taken on the T-piece. The CPAP-HF mode resulted in the least distortion, reversing chest wall distortion in five patients, improving it in two, and not changing the distortion in the remaining two. The improvements may be related to positive pleural pressures and to the minimal ventilator-imposed load of the high gas flow system. The distortion imposed by ventilators increases the work of breathing in these patients and may thus contribute to difficulty in weaning.\r"

Several studies have reported beneficial results but with conflicting effects on lung volume. We studied the effects of PEEP on pulmonary hyperinflation, gas exchange, and circulation in six patients (59 +/- 19 yr, four men, two women) with severe airflow obstruction requiring mechanical ventilation (four with asthma, two with an exacerbation of chronic airflow obstruction). Three levels of PEEP (5, 10, and 15 cm H2O) were studied. All patients were paralyzed and ventilated with a tidal volume of 1.0 L, and respiratory rates (R) of 10, 16, and 22 breaths per min. End-inspiratory lung volume (VEI) or the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation above functional residual capacity (FRC) was quantified by measuring total exhaled gas volume during a period of apnea following steady-state tidal inspiration (1). Two patients were not studied at 15 cm H2O PEEP because of hypotension. Without PEEP, all patients showed gas trapping above FRC that increased progressively as R was increased (i.e., expiratory time decreased). At each R, increases in PEEP progressively increased FRC up to 1.42 +/- 0.43 L (mean +/- SD) at 15 cm H2O PEEP (n = 4) and progressively reduced the degree of gas trapping above the PEEP FRC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence and mortality rates are increasing rapidly in women. Two main tests have been used to screen for lung cancer: chest roentgenography and sputum cytology. Four recent controlled trials and one case-control study failed, however, to show that screening reduces lung cancer mortality even in high-risk persons (smokers). In the Mayo Lung Project, for example, the lung cancer death rate in high-risk men offered sputum cytology and chest roentgenogram every 4 months was 3.1 per 1000 person-years, compared with 3.0 per 1000 person-years in a control group. Chest roentgenograms and sputum cytology lead to false-positive test results in smokers of approximately 5% and 0.5%, respectively. Because of the lack of evidence of benefit and because of its potential harms and costs, screening for lung cancer is not recommended.\r"

Absorption experiments demonstrated that these antibodies are also responsible for the antisarcolemmal antibody pattern in the immunofluorescence test and for the reaction with pig kidney microsomes in the ELISA. Immunochemical studies showed that laminin binding of high or low titer in sera from patients and normal individuals is due to the Gal alpha 1-3Gal epitope present in N-linked oligosaccharides of mouse laminin. No reactions were observed with human laminin, which lacks this epitope. The findings suggest that high levels of antibodies against carbohydrate structures are triggered by persistent infections, providing some new insights about the possible cause of these diseases.\r"

The levels of protease inhibitors alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in the MEF were significantly higher than in nonsensitized animals. Fibrinolytic (plasminogen activator [PA]) activity was detected in the MEF; however, only a small level of activity of nonspecific proteases was detected because of the significant level of antitryptic activity in the MEF. The levels of protease inhibitors and PA activity were significantly reduced by the steroid treatment. It is concluded that protease inhibitors play an important role in the protection of the middle ear mucosa and that corticosteroid treatment can reduce the severity of IC otitis media.\r"

A previous trial of zinc gluconate supported its efficacy in treating URIs, but the effectiveness of blinding was uncertain. We conducted a prospective randomized trial of zinc gluconate versus a taste-matched placebo of sucrose octaacetate. Lozenges containing either 23 mg of elemental zinc or placebo were taken every 2 h. Eleven URI symptoms were rated daily on a scale of 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). Duration of illness, reflected in the proportion of subjects remaining symptomatic on each day, was not significantly reduced (maximum difference of 12.6% on day 7, P = 0.09; 95% confidence interval, -6 to 31%) by either treatment. Severity of illness, assessed by using a summed severity score, was reduced incrementally by 7 to 8% on days 5 to 7 (P = 0.02) in subjects taking zinc. Adverse effects, mostly nausea and altered taste, were reported by 50% of subjects taking zinc. We conclude that while zinc gluconate may produce a small reduction in overall severity of symptoms, this is not clinically significant. Given the additional high incidence of adverse effects, zinc gluconate cannot be recommended for use in the treatment of acute URIs.\r"

We have shown earlier that viable M. leprae readily incorporates radiolabeled palmitic acid into phenolic glycolipid I when residing in cultured macrophages in vitro and that this process is inhibited by the antileprosy drug rifampin. In the present paper we report that application of this observation to the rapid evaluation of over 25 antimicrobial agents for potential antileprosy activity in vitro. All the known antileprosy drugs rifampin, dapsone, clofazimine, and ethionamide inhibited phenolic glycolipid I synthesis. Rifabutin, a spiropiperidyl derivative of rifamycin, also reported to be active in the mouse model, was very effective. Interestingly, the macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were also found to be active in this system, while D-cycloserine and other cell wall synthesis inhibitors showed no effect. Many of the compounds found to be active in this system have been reported to be effective in vivo in mice. This correlation lends support to the feasibility of using phenolic glycolipid I synthesis for the rapid evaluation of new drugs against leprosy.\r"

In this work, the effect of fluoroquinolones on P fimbria expression and function in E. coli SS142 and C1212 was assessed. Ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin were compared with their precursor nalidixic acid and with trimethoprim in sublethal concentrations ranging from 1/32 to 1/4 of the MIC. Fimbria function was assessed in a standard hemagglutination assay and in a parallel hemagglutination inhibition assay in which the tier of antifimbrial antiserum necessary to inhibit hemagglutination by SS142 was determined. Adhesion of antibiotic-exposed bacteria to human uroma T24 cells in suspension was also measured. Fimbria production was quantitated in an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Trimethoprim produced a dose-dependent decrease of three to four hemagglutination titers for both strains and a decline in the antiserum titer from 1:16 (control) to 1:128 (1/4 MIC) for E. coli SS142. Adherence exhibited similar decrements from 130 +/- 28 (control) to 16 +/- 3 (1/4 MIC) and from 83 +/- 19 (control) to 30 +/- 11 (1/4 MIC) E. coli cells per uroepithelial cell (mean +/- standard error) for SS142 and C1212, respectively (P less than 0.015). By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the inhibition following exposure decreased in a dose-dependent manner from 31% (control) to 8% (1/4 MIC). By contrast, none of the quinolones produced significant changes in the parameters assessed above. At sublethal concentrations, trimethoprim decreased fimbria production. Following exposure to fluoroquinolones, however, E. coli expressed morphologically and functionally intact P fimbriae.\r"

The compounds were administered to simulate in rabbit plasma the concentration-versus-time curves observed in humans after 30-min infusions of Timentin (3 g of ticarcillin plus 100 mg of clavulanic acid), ticarcillin (3 g), and ceftazidime (2 g). Single- and multiple-dosing schedules were used. The penetrations of clavulanic acid into CSF (expressed as [area under the concentration-time curve for CSF/area under the curve for plasma] x 100) after the two dosing schedules were 28 and 24.5%, similar to that for ceftazidime (21%; multiple-dosing only) and greater than those for ticarcillin (8.4 and 9.3%). Ticarcillin was ineffective in reducing viable counts in CSF but, in the presence of clavulanic acid, reduced bacterial numbers by approximately 99% at 4 h after a single dose and by 99.99% at 12 h after three doses given at 4-h intervals. Two doses of ceftazidime given 8 h apart were more effective than the three doses of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, in keeping with the in vitro activities of these compounds against the infecting organism. These results illustrate the ability of clavulanic acid to penetrate the blood-CSF barrier such that concentrations of the inhibitor in CSF potentiate the activity of ticarcillin against the ticarcillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing strain of K. pneumoniae.\r"

To study this phenomenon, a strain of Escherichia coli inhibited but inefficiently killed by (i.e., partially tolerant to) norfloxacin was isolated and characterized. E. coli KL16 (norfloxacin MIC, 0.10 microgram/ml; MBC, 0.20 microgram/ml) was mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine and cyclically exposed to 3 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml. After five cycles, a bacterial strain (DS1) which was killed 1,000-fold less than KL16 during 3 h of drug exposure was isolated. The MIC and MBC of norfloxacin for DS1 were 0.20 and 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Over a range of norfloxacin concentrations, DS1 was killed 2 to 4 orders of magnitude less than KL16. DS1 grew more slowly than KL16 but after normalization for growth rate was killed four times less rapidly than KL16 at drug concentrations 10-fold higher than respective MICs. DS1 and KL16 cells filamented similarly upon exposure to norfloxacin. DS1 exhibited tolerance to other DNA gyrase A subunit antagonists (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and DNA gyrase B subunit antagonists (novobiocin and coumermycin) but not to the aminoglycoside gentamicin, suggesting involvement of DNA gyrase. DS1 also appeared to be minimally tolerant to the beta-lactam cefoxitin. DS1 exhibited increased susceptibility to the mutagen methyl methanesulfonate, implying a defect in DNA repair. This report describes the first use of quinolone enrichment for isolation of a bacterial strain partially tolerant to quinolones. The study of defects in such tolerant strains offers an approach to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial killing by quinolones.\r"

A multifactorial experimental design procedure in which the concentrations of all drugs in test combinations were simultaneously varied has been used to identify and quantify drug interactions. The methods have been applied to combinations of two, three, and four drugs, including antineoplastic drugs, antifungal drugs, and combinations of antineoplastic and antifungal drugs. Results were obtained which allow predictions of effects of combinations and provide maximum effectiveness in growth inhibition with minimum levels of the test drugs.\r"

Six of the Klebsiella strains and the E. coli strain were shown to produce a novel beta-lactamase (CAZ-lo) with a pI of 5.6 that hydrolyzed broad-spectrum cephalosporins at low but comparable levels. One strain of K. pneumoniae was of a serotype different from that of the other strains and produced a plasmid-encoded cefuroximase (FUR) with a pI of 7.5 that mediated moderate levels of resistance to different broad-spectrum cephalosporins. High-level resistance to ceftazidime was detected in one other strain of K. pneumoniae, which produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.5 (CAZ-hi). Apart from its pI, this enzyme differed from CAZ-lo by a specific and high hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime. The epidemiological context suggested that CAZ-hi may be a mutant of CAZ-lo, and this hypothesis was supported by the isolation of laboratory mutants of CAZ-lo showing properties identical to those of the clinical CAZ-hi enzyme.\r"

In vivo, the combination had a greater bactericidal effect (P less than 0.01) and resulted in a greater number of sterile vegetations (P less than 0.05) than single-drug therapy.

Side effects were compared with 99 matched infants receiving diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus and polio vaccines only. No serious side effects were observed and the incidence of minor side effects was no greater in the recipients of H influenzae type b conjugate vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine (standard and low) were compared: geometric mean titres of serum anticapsular antibody rose from 0.11 microgram/ml before immunisation to 26.4 micrograms/ml after three immunisations with the standard dose and 14.6 micrograms/ml with the low dose. The geometric mean titre among 21 unimmunized infants at this age was 0.06 micrograms/ml. Both doses therefore generated antibody concentrations likely to be protective after three immunisations. There were no non-responders. Incorporation of an H influenzae type b conjugate vaccine into the primary immunisation schedule has the potential for preventing over 1000 cases of systemic H influenzae type b disease and 50 deaths each year in the United Kingdom.\r"

Of the 50 children with confirmed urinary tract infections who were followed up 48 hours after treatment with a single dose of trimethoprim all were free of infection, whereas two of the 56 who received the course of co-trimoxazole (4%) had persisting infections. At follow up after 10 days, however, significantly more of the group treated with trimethoprim had evidence of recurrent urinary tract infection compared with those who had received co-trimoxazole (10 of 44, 23%, compared with one of 46, 2%). Of the recurrences in the trimethoprim group, six were asymptomatic.

This paper provides a review of the epidemiologic and toxicologic evidence concerning health effects--particularly carcinogenicity--attributable to sub-lethal acid exposure. Underlying biologic mechanisms that explain adverse health outcomes include pH modulation of toxicity for a number of xenobiotics (including carcinogens, genotoxins, and teratogens), and low-pH-induced changes of cells involving, for example, alterations in mitotic and enzyme regulation. More focused research is recommended to test the relationship between long-term exposures to acidic agents (with a consequent lowered cellular pH) and various health effects.\r"

Although the cholinergic system has been implicated in schizophrenia, it has not been accorded a major role in current theories of pathophysiology. We present evidence from several lines of research that suggests that muscarinic hyperactivity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of negative schizophrenic symptoms. Specifically, cholinergic overdrive leads to a behavioral syndrome strikingly similar to the negative schizophrenic syndrome, anticholinergic agents may alleviate negative symptoms, schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms tend to \"abuse\" anticholinergics, and polysomnographic, neuroendocrine, and other pharmacological findings appear to be generally consistent with this hypothesis. The hypothesis is testable and is presented as a heuristic model that focuses on the dynamic interplay between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in schizophrenia.\r"

To increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of abnormal fibrosis in cicatricial pemphigoid, the growth characteristics of conjunctival fibroblasts, from untreated patients with cicatricial pemphigoid (n = 9) and normal controls (n = 6), were studied in tissue culture. The latent period until fibroblast outgrowth began from the conjunctival explant was determined, as were the plating efficiency and doubling time of cells from first-passage cultures. Outgrowths of fibroblasts from patients with cicatricial pemphigoid appeared significantly sooner than from controls, 8.1 +/- 3.8 vs 19.3 +/- 6.4 (mean +/- SD) days. While there was no significant difference in the plating efficiency between fibroblasts from cicatricial pemphigoid (mean +/- SD, 116.4% +/- 44.6%) and those from controls (71.0% +/- 39.4%), the doubling time was significantly faster for cicatricial pemphigoid than for controls, 26.5 +/- 8.5 vs 50.7 +/- 7.8 hours. Thus, conjunctival fibroblasts from patients with cicatricial pemphigoid are hyperproliferative in tissue culture when compared with normal controls. Therefore, scarring, which characterizes cicatricial pemphigoid, may be due, in part, to excessive fibroblast proliferation.\r"

The IOL is secured in the ciliary sulcus by suturing the haptics to the sclera at the ciliary sulcus inferiorly and to the sclera or iris superiorly. We have used this technique for secondary IOL implantation in 16 contact lens-intolerant patients with aphakia with a mean follow-up of 9 months (range, 5 to 20 months) and in eight eyes at the time of IOL removal. All eyes with secondary implants had equal or improved vision postoperatively; none developed persistent angiographic cystoid macular edema. In the 8 patients with IOL exchange, visual acuity improved in five eyes, remained the same in two, and decreased two lines in one. Suturing of an IOL in the ciliary sulcus has enabled us to use a posterior chamber IOL in eyes without a posterior capsule when secondary IOL implantation or IOL exchange is indicated. Secondary posterior chamber IOL implantation is recommended only when satisfactory vision cannot be achieved with glasses or contact lenses, and further follow-up is needed before this procedure can be widely recommended.\r"

One patient had unusual peripheral retinal findings. The incidence of ocular manifestations in pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is considerably less than reported in several adult series. However, we recommend ophthalmic screening in all pediatric patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with encephalopathy or disseminated opportunistic infections, or when symptoms suggest ophthalmic involvement.\r"

In an effort to mimic a \"worst case\" clinical scenario, each respective virus was allowed to air dry on the tonometer tip for 10 minutes. Inoculated tonometers were then (1) not treated, (2) wiped with a disposable (Kim-wipe) tissue or sterile gauze; (3) wiped with sterile gauze soaked with 3% hydrogen peroxide; or (4) wiped with a 70% isopropyl alcohol swab. The hydrogen peroxide treatment and the alcohol wipes both completely disinfected the tonometer tips for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, whereas wiping with a sterile gauze or tissue was not effective. Wiping the Goldmann tonometer tip with an isopropyl alcohol swab and then allowing the alcohol to evaporate provides a ready and efficient means of inactivating these three enveloped viruses.\r"

One trial involving 255 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was a 12-week, randomized controlled trail of diclofenac, naproxen, and aspirin. Two trials were open-label studies of 24 weeks duration that included 165 RA and 355 osteoarthritis (OA) patients, all of whom were treated with diclofenac. In addition to the AIMS, tender joint count, morning stiffness, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were used as outcome measures in the trials. The AIMS results showed substantial improvements in Physical Function, Psychological Status, and Pain, as well as in overall Arthritis Impact. These improvements were detected by the time of the initial outcome assessment at 4 weeks or 8 weeks, and were detected in patients with either OA or RA. These AIMS results closely parallel improvements shown by traditional clinical measures, and demonstrate that the AIMS health status measure is sensitive to improvements in OA as well as in RA. The AIMS also detects responses produced by therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and these improvements can be demonstrated in as short a treatment time as 4 weeks. These findings confirm the utility of the AIMS for assessing outcome in rheumatic disease studies, and they have implications for the design of future clinical trials of NSAIDs.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, attention has focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function. When administered in vitro to the isolated perfused kidney, calcium antagonists exhibit consistent actions, permitting characterization of their renal effects. Calcium antagonists do not affect the vasodilated isolated perfused kidney, but they do dramatically alter the response of the kidney to vasoconstrictor agents. In the presence of norepinephrine, calcium antagonists markedly augment the glomerular filtration rate, but produce only a modest improvement in renal perfusion. By use of the postischemic, hydronephrotic rat kidney model, which permits direct visualization of afferent and efferent arterioles, it can be demonstrated that the above-mentioned preferential augmentation of glomerular filtration rate may be attributable to a selective vasodilation of preglomerular vessels. Although the clinical implications of such observations are not yet clear, preliminary studies in experimental animal models indicate that calcium antagonists might exert salutary effects on renal function in clinical settings characterized by impaired renal hemodynamics. There is a need to carry out prospective studies to determine the benefits of calcium antagonists in ameliorating the development of renal dysfunction in patients at risk of acute renal insufficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Our ability to measure precisely the pressures and flows within the glomerular microcirculation has enabled us to begin to unravel the complex relationship between systemic hypertension and kidney disease. Although a number of factors have been implicated in the development of glomerular sclerosis, one consistent finding has been that glomerular injury occurs when elevated pressures are transmitted to the glomerular capillaries. Intrarenal hypertension, in conjunction with renal hypertrophy, and, possibly, disturbances in lipid metabolism and blood coagulation constitute secondary processes through which those nephrons not severely injured by the primary renal disease are eventually destroyed. Ultimately, all renal function is lost. Clinically, increased glomerular pressure is likely to contribute to glomerular injury in those patients in whom hypertension and renal insufficiency coexist. In patients with diabetes, as yet unidentified factors cause preglomerular resistance to fall so that glomerular hypertension develops even in the absence of elevation in systemic blood pressure. Although no therapy has been proven to slow the rate of progression to end stage renal failure in humans, a number of promising interventions have been identified. These include dietary protein or salt restriction, and medication, with either converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers.\r"

If calcium antagonists can control both systemic and glomerular hypertension, they may be able to attenuate this process. Short-term studies in our laboratory suggest that the calcium antagonists amlodipine, diltiazem, and nifedipine preserve and/or improve renal function; there were no adverse effects on glomerular filtration, effective renal plasma flow, and/or urinary protein excretion. However, long-term clinical trials are required to determine if the observed short-term renal responses are sustained and if calcium antagonists protect the human kidney from systemic and glomerular hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Two parallel lines of research increasingly implicate calcium in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Studies at the molecular-cellular level reveal that, as part of a second messenger system, calcium plays a critical role in cellular responses that are of special relevance to blood pressure homeostasis. Investigations at the epidemiological and clinical levels have also increasingly involved calcium in hypertension, although the data produced are often contradictory, suggesting alternately that hypertension involves excess calcium and that the disorder is associated with a calcium deficiency. In our own research, which emphasizes both the biochemical and the clinical heterogeneity of the hypertensive process, we have found that divalent cation metabolism may be shifted in both directions away from average normotensive values among different types of hypertension. In addition, these calcium metabolic shifts appear to mediate the pressor effects of salt in both human and experimental forms of hypertension and may help identify individuals for whom different therapeutic regimens would be appropriate. We have developed a working cellular hypothesis in which all forms of hypertension are seen as calcium-dependent. One form is more critically dependent on extracellular calcium and is characterized by low plasma renin activity, dietary salt sensitivity, and therapeutic responsiveness to oral calcium supplementation and to calcium-channel blockade. At the opposite extreme, the intracellular calcium-dependent, angiotensin II-mediated form is characterized by high renin, lack of salt sensitivity, and preferential response to beta-blockade and converting-enzyme inhibition.\r"

Echocardiography has shown the left ventricle to be heterogeneous in hypertensive patients with regard to both the extent to which it uses increased myocardial mass or enhanced contractile performance to sustain the pressure load of hypertension and to the geometric patterns in which hypertensive LV hypertrophy occurs. The possible relationship of this heterogeneity of cardiac patterns in hypertension to differences in the etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of hypertension is a fruitful area for further investigation.\r"

The use of vasodilator agents, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers results in blood pressure reduction without adverse metabolic consequences. Furthermore, vasodilatory agents reverse the principal physiological abnormality of hypertensive patients, that is, they reverse the increased systemic vascular resistance that characterizes these patients and, in so doing, may alleviate abnormalities of systolic and diastolic left ventricular performance. In particular, a comparison of the effects of nifedipine and propranolol on left ventricular (LV) function in patients with moderately severe hypertension revealed significant differences in their effects on cardiac function. Although both drugs reduced blood pressure to an identical degree, nifedipine therapy was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and improved parameters of left ventricular contractile and diastolic function as measured by quantitative radionuclide ventriculography. Vasodilator therapy should be considered for the initial treatment of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension.\r"

To test the potential ototoxicity of the drug, 0.5 mL of a 10% solution of ceftazidime was introduced into the bullae of 22 chinchillas. The organ of Corti was normal in 20 temporal bones examined at 1 week after administration of the ceftazidime solution. Only 2 of 24 temporal bones examined after 4 weeks showed minor outer hair cell loss of the basal turn of the organ of Corti. Focal hemorrhage and occasional serous effusions were found in the middle ears of all animals after 1 week; these findings had mostly cleared after 4 weeks. Our results indicate that ceftazidime causes reversible middle ear inflammation, and may have some minor ototoxic potential under these experimental conditions.\r"
