  ".W": "Despite mass vaccination against diphtheria, many people have antibody titers below the protective level of 0.01 IU per milliliter. A recent outbreak of diphtheria in Sweden caused 17 clinical cases of diphtheria in the city of Goteborg; three of the patients died. A satellite outbreak occurred in Stockholm after a few months' delay. Using a new genetic probe, we analyzed 36 strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolated in Sweden and Denmark during the period 1976 to 1986. Although the 36 strains can be classified in 17 different groups of C. diphtheriae (several of them containing toxigenic strains), all the clinical and fatal cases of diphtheria were caused by isolates from the same group, strongly suggesting that the outbreak in Sweden was caused by a single strain that possibly had a virulence factor separate from toxigenicity. This strain may have been imported into Sweden from Denmark, since it was isolated for the first time in Copenhagen in 1983, before the outbreak in Sweden.\r"

Because food and water are generally considered basic elements of humane care, representing love and concern for the helpless, it is often thought that they must always be provided. In a landmark decision, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled that a feeding tube could be removed from a patient in a persistent vegetative state if this was consistent with his previously expressed wishes. The case of Paul E. Brophy, Sr., is part of an emerging medical and legal consensus on the withholding of artificial feeding from adult patients. The view is growing that tube and intravenous feeding should be likened to other medical interventions and not to the routine provision of nursing care or comfort. Competent patients have the right to refuse such feeding. Feeding can also be stopped incompetent patients who have earlier stated such a wish.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian G proteins transduce information from extracellular signals, including neurotransmitters, hormones and sensory stimuli, into regulation of effector enzymes or ion channels within cells. Triggered by appropriate extracellular signals, receptor proteins specifically activate members of the G protein family by catalysing replacement of GDP by GTP at the guanine nucleotide binding site. Like the receptor proteins, the heterotrimeric G proteins exhibit impressive structural similarities, suggesting that all receptor-G protein interactions use homologous structural elements and a single molecular mechanism. Topologically equivalent portions of each G protein may therefore interact with the appropriate receptor. We recently predicted the secondary structure of a composite G protein alpha-chain and proposed that a predicted amphipathic alpha-helix at the extreme carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide directly contacts receptors. This proposal has now been confirmed by sequencing complementary DNAs of the gene that encodes the alpha-chain (alpha s) of the stimulatory regulator (Gs) of adenylyl cyclase in wild-type cells and in a mutant mouse S49 lymphoma cell line, unc, in which Gs cannot be activated by hormone receptors. The sequences reveal a point mutation in the unc gene that substitutes a proline residue for an arginine near the carboxy-terminus of the alpha s-polypeptide. Expression of recombinant alpha s-unc in genetically alpha s-deficient S49 cells reproduces the unc phenotype.\r"

  ".U": "88094709\r", 
  ".W": "The activation of a guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein is an essential step in coupling certain receptors to the inhibition of voltage-activated calcium channels. We have previously observed that analogues of GTP potentiate the effect of receptor agonists and inhibit calcium currents in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. A residual sustained 'L-type' component of the calcium channel current is resistant to inhibition by internal guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate (GTP-gamma-S). Because calcium channel antagonists such as D600, nifedipine and diltiazem inhibit L currents, we examined their effect on GTP-gamma-S-modified currents. These compounds all produced a rapid and very marked potentiation of calcium channel currents in the presence of internal GTP-gamma-S and this effect was prevented by pertussis toxin which ADP ribosylates the G proteins Gi/Go (for review see ref. 10). We suggest that this potentiation indicates that activated G protein can interact with the calcium channel, and that this enhances the action of calcium channel ligands at their agonist sites on the channel in its resting state. These results represent the first electrophysiological evidence that guanine nucleotides are able to influence cellular responses to calcium channel ligands.\r"

  ".W": "The growth of mature T lymphocytes is regulated by interaction between interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor. Three distinct binding sites for IL-2, namely low- (Kd 10 nM), intermediate- (Kd 100 pM) and high- (Kd 10 pM) affinity sites, have been found on human and primate T lymphocytes. Chemical crosslinking of labelled IL-2 to human T cells shows that two polypeptide chains, p55 (L chain) and p75 (H chain), bind IL-2 with low and intermediate affinities respectively. The high-affinity binding was shown to arise from ternary complex formation of IL-2, L and H chains. Construction of mutants of the L-chain complementary DNA indicated that the L chain is not directly involved in growth signal transduction. Nevertheless, expression of the IL-2 receptor L chain is tightly regulated by antigen or mitogen stimulation. To investigate the L chain function, we have produced transgenic mice using human L-chain cDNA of the IL-2 receptor under the control of a constitutive promoter. Studies on the L-chain transgenic mice showed that functionally active IL-2 receptors with high affinity were expressed on unstimulated spleen and thymus cells. The results indicate that the H chain of the IL-2 receptor is constitutively expressed in T cells.\r"

A net savings of $6 million would be realized in the first year, with annual savings eventually increasing to over $13 million, from the prevention of chlamydia-associated pelvic inflammatory disease and other long-term sequelae such as tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Over $60 million could be saved in the first five years of such a statewide screening program. In populations with infection prevalence of 2% or more, such screening will pay for itself and can be considered \"cost-effective.\" Screening of asymptomatic women for chlamydia should be carried out in most American family planning clinics.\r"

Older patients generally consumed a disproportionately higher share of resources. Length of hospital stay, intensive care unit use, blood transfusion requirements, and overall hospital cost generally increased with age. Although mean Diagnostic Related Group reimbursement per patient also rose with age, it plateaued for patients 65 years of age and older. However, our hospital did not sustain a loss in providing care under Diagnostic Related Groups for older patients, except for the group of patients between the ages of 75-79 years. Although older gynecology patients generally had higher hospital resource consumption than younger patients, the current Diagnostic Related Group system seemed to adequately reimburse our hospital for their care.\r"

Sixteen episodes occurred in 14 babies. GDE accounted for 8 of 19 (42%) episodes of neonatal bacteremia during the epidemic period vs. only 8 of 159 (5%) episodes during the remaining 4.5 years (endemic period) (P less than 0.001). Blood isolates were all identified as Streptococcus faecalis. A combination of three strain-typing methods successfully distinguished the epidemic organisms from endemic nursery strains of GDE and from \"background\" GDE flora in the hospital. Nursery isolates were all susceptible to ampicillin, intermediate or resistant to the aminoglycosides and variably resistant to the newer cephalosporins. There were no differences in antibiotic susceptibilities of the GDE or in characteristics of the patients that were unique to the epidemic. Neonates with GDE sepsis had a mean birth weight of 913 g, a mean gestational age of 27 weeks and a mean age of onset of sepsis of 8.5 weeks. Twenty-five controls, matched for birth weight and admission date, were identified. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) between cases and controls included: use of a nonumbilical central line (71 vs. 32%); days central line in place (26.5 vs. 6.5 days); and bowel resection (29 vs. 4%). This is the first reported outbreak of S. faecalis sepsis in neonates. GDE are important nosocomial pathogens that must be considered in late onset neonatal sepsis.\r"

Sixteen babies received only parenteral nutrients for five to 21 days. Ten of these received a typical regimen by peripheral vein (1.91 +/- 0.16 g/kg/d of amino acids and 44.7 +/- 4.4 kcal/kg/d) and six received a typical regimen through a central vein (2.39 +/- 0.11 g/kg/d of amino acids and 95.9 +/- 14.5 kcal/kg/d). Mean weight gain of the peripheral vein subgroup was 10.3 +/- 10.6 g/kg/d; mean nitrogen balance was 230 +/- 66 mg/kg/d. Both the mean rate of weight gain (17.2 +/- 5.1 g/kg/d) and the mean rate of nitrogen retention (267 +/- 49 g/kg/d) of the central vein subgroup were similar to intrauterine rates. In these two subgroups as well as the total population, plasma concentrations of all amino acids except phenylalanine were within the 95% confidence limits of the plasma concentrations observed in LBW infants fed sufficient amounts of human milk to result in a rate of weight gain similar to the intrauterine rate. However, although plasma tyrosine and cyst(e)ine concentrations were within the 95% confidence limits of the plasma concentrations goals, the LBW infant's ability to use N-acetyl-L-tyrosine and cysteine HCl appears to be even less than that of the term infant and older child. In toto, these data support the efficacy of the amino acid mixture evaluated for LBW infants. Of equal importance, they suggest that the LBW infant's ability to use parenterally delivered amino acids is not as limited as commonly thought.\r"

They must consider not only the best interests of their patients but also the interests of a cost-conscious society. To meet their new societal obligations, physicians trained solely to serve the patient's best interest must now learn how to do so at the least expense. This implies knowing both the costs and the performance characteristics of the diagnostic tests ordered in follow-up. The authors analyze this dilemma as it applies to follow-up of patients following primary treatment for colon cancer or nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Principles of cost-effective patient management are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Sucrose is transported into Bacillus subtilis cells by way of a phosphotransferase system, which consists of a specific enzyme II, a nonspecific enzyme I, and a histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein. Mutations in the sacP locus abolish the specific transport of sucrose. The B. subtilis sacP gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and transformed cells could transport and phosphorylate sucrose. This indicates that the sacP gene product is enzyme II of the sucrose phosphotransferase system of B. subtilis. The nucleotide sequence of the sacP gene was determined and was found to overlap with the sacA gene at the tetranucleotide ATGA, which may allow a translational coupling between sacP and sacA. The two genes are therefore probably organized in an operon structure with the promoter located 5' to sacP gene. The deduced amino acid sequence gave a Mr of 48,945 for the sucrose-specific enzyme II polypeptide. The amino acid sequence was compared to that of three other known enteric bacterial enzymes II (beta-glucoside-specific enzyme II, mannitol-specific enzyme II, and glucose-specific enzyme II). Homology was found with beta-glucoside enzyme II, and well conserved regions were identified through the comparison of the proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The homology of angiogenin and pancreatic RNase A provides a compelling reason to systematically compare the characteristics of the two proteins using the chemical modification approaches that proved essential to understanding the action of RNase. Reagents specific for histidine, lysine, and arginine markedly decrease the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin, much as has been observed for RNase A. Activity is abolished by reduction of the disulfide bonds and is restored by reoxidation. Methionine, tyrosine, and carboxyl group reagents have no significant effect. From the point of view of reactivity, the histidine and lysine residues in angiogenin are severalfold less susceptible to modification than those in RNase A. Arginine reagents, on the other hand, inactivate angiogenin considerably faster than RNase A. Considering specificity, bromoacetate inactivates angiogenin at pH 5.5 by modifying 1.5 histidines, but lysine and arginine reagents are less specific. Thus, 3.8 and 6.3 residues, respectively, are modified by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and by formaldehyde plus cyanoborohydride, under conditions where activity decreases by approximately 80% in both cases. With phenylglyoxal, 6.7 arginines are lost when there is 92% inactivation. Poly(G) prevents inactivation by lysine and arginine reagents, and phosphate protects against the effects of lysine modification. Thus, the functional consequences of these modifications likely reflect the loss of critical residues rather than general conformational effects.\r"

The receptor was synthesized as a 145-kDa precursor, which, when incubated with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H), underwent a 15-kDa decrease in molecular mass. This indicates that the size of the core protein is about 130 kDa and that the 145-kDa form represents a receptor precursor carrying high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide groups. Within 15 min after synthesis, the receptor was converted to a 165-kDa form. This form was entirely resistant to endo H treatment and probably represents a receptor molecule that has undergone further posttranslational modification, including O-linked glycosylation. Subsequently, within 30 min, a molecule of 170 kDa--i.e., the size of the mature receptor--appeared. A slightly larger molecule, of 175 kDa, which could be immunoprecipitated from PDGF-stimulated 32P-labeled cells, probably represents a receptor further modified by autophosphorylation. The 170-kDa molecule had an isoelectric point of about 4.5. Addition of PDGF increased the turnover rate of the 170-kDa PDGF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase is an enzyme, possibly analogous to rhodopsin kinase, that multiply phosphorylates the beta-adrenergic receptor only when it is occupied by stimulatory agonists. Since this kinase may play an important role in mediating the process of homologous, or agonist-specific, desensitization, we investigated the functional consequences of receptor phosphorylation by the kinase and possible analogies with the mechanism of action of rhodopsin kinase. Pure hamster lung beta 2-adrenergic receptor, reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, was assessed for its ability to mediate agonist-promoted stimulation of the GTPase activity of coreconstituted stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein. When the receptor was phosphorylated by partially (approximately 350-fold) purified preparations of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, as much as 80% inactivation of its functional activity was observed. However, the use of more highly purified enzyme preparations led to a dramatic decrease in the ability of phosphorylation to inactivate the receptor such that pure enzyme preparations (approximately 20,000-fold purified) caused only minimal (approximately 1off/- 7%) inactivation. Addition of pure retinal arrestin (48-kDa protein or S antigen), which is involved in enhancing the inactivating effect of rhodopsin phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase, led to partial restoration of the functional effect of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-promoted phosphorylation (41 +/- 3% inactivation). These results suggest the possibility that a protein analogous to retinal arrestin may exist in other tissues and function in concert with beta-adrenergic receptor kinase to regulate the activity of adenylate cyclase-coupled receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88097395\r", 
  ".W": "Four alanine-based peptides were designed, synthesized, and tested by circular dichroism for alpha-helix formation in H2O. Each peptide has three glutamic/lysine residue pairs, is 16 or 17 amino acids long, and has blocked alpha-NH2 and alpha-COOH groups. In one set of peptides (\"i+4\"), the glutamic and lysine residues are spaced 4 residues or 1 residue apart. In the other set (\"i+3\"), the spacing is 3 or 2 residues. Within each of these sets, a pair of peptides was made in which the positions of the glutamic and lysine residues are reversed [Glu, Lys (E,K) vs. Lys, Glu (K,E)] in order to assess the interaction of the charged side chains with the helix dipole. Since the amino acid compositions of these peptides differ at most by a single alanine residue, differences in helicity are caused chiefly by the spacing and positions of the charged residues. The basic aim of this study was to test for helix stabilization by (Glu-, Lys+) ion pairs or salt bridges (H-bonded ion pairs). The results are as follows. (i) All four peptides show significant helix formation, and the stability of the alpha-helix does not depend on peptide concentration in the range studied. The best helix-former is (i+4)E,K, which shows approximately 80% helicity in 0.01 M NaCl at pH 7 and 0 degree C. (ii) The two i+4 peptides show more helix formation than the i+3 peptides. pH titration gives no evidence for helix stabilization by i+3 ion pairs. (iii) Surprisingly, the i+4 peptides form more stable helices than the i+3 peptides at extremes of pH (pH 2 and pH 12) as well as at pH 7. These results may be explained by helix stabilization through Glu-...Lys+ salt bridges at pH 7 and singly charged H bonds at pH 2 (Glu0...Lys+) and pH 12 (Glu-...Lys0). The reason why these links stabilize the alpha-helix more effectively in the i+4 than in the i+3 peptides is not known. (iv) Reversal of the positions of glutamic and lysine residues usually affects helix stability in the manner expected for interaction of these charged groups with the helix dipole. (v) alpha-Helix formation in these alanine-based peptides is enthalpy-driven, as is helix formation by the C-peptide of ribonuclease A.\r"

Since transduction of growth factor signals may require proteins encoded by cellular ras oncogenes, we have tested whether a mutationally altered Harvey ras expression vector, by itself, can prevent establishment of a differentiated phenotype in BC3H1 mouse myoblasts. Transfection with the valine-12 allele of the human Harvey ras gene, under the control of its own promoter, was sufficient to prevent the induction of both muscle creatine kinase activity and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor following mitogen withdrawal but did not inhibit withdrawal from the cell cycle. The loss of creatine kinase activity resulted from a corresponding block to induction of muscle creatine kinase mRNA. Similarly, mitogen withdrawal elicited little or no alpha-actin mRNA in ras-transfected cells. These results suggest that an activated ras allele can inhibit myogenesis through a mechanism independent of cell proliferation and can preclude activation of genes whose up-regulation normally accompanies mitogen withdrawal.\r"

Transcripts of the alpha 1-subunit gene were detected in all tissues tested, whereas alpha 2- and alpha 3-subunit mRNA species were expressed predominantly in brain. The pattern of expression of beta-subunit mRNA also was complex and tissue specific but was distinct from that of any of the alpha-subunit mRNAs. Cell lines derived from the rat central nervous system and the pheochromocytoma PC12 expressed the mRNAs for all three alpha-subunit isoforms, whereas beta-subunit mRNA was detected only in PC12 cells. The distinct expression patterns of rat Na+,K+-ATPase mRNAs suggest that different members of the ATPase family may have specialized functions.\r"

The expression of specific receptors for peptide hormones in such a translation system would facilitate studies on the structure and regulation of cell-surface receptors as well as their coupling to membrane transduction mechanisms. The expression of receptors for calcium-mobilizing hormones in Xenopus oocytes was sought by analysis of phospholipid turnover in hormone-stimulated oocytes. For this purpose, Xenopus oocytes were injected with mRNA extracted from bovine adrenal and pituitary glands and incubated with myo-[3H]inositol to label plasma-membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The expression of functionally active receptors for angiotensin II (AII) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was demonstrated by the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate production by AII and TRH in the mRNA-injected, [3H]inositol-prelabeled oocytes. The ability of AII and TRH to act by way of newly synthesized receptors from mammalian endocrine tissues to stimulate phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate hydrolysis in Xenopus oocytes suggests a generalized and conserved mechanism of receptor coupling to the transduction mechanism responsible for activation of phospholipase C in the plasma membrane.\r"

The breakpoints of these karyotypic abnormalities occur in chromosome bands 14q11 and 14q32--the same bands in which the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes have been mapped, respectively. Patients with ataxia-telangiectasia are particularly prone to development of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia with such chromosomal abnormalities. We now describe DNA rearrangements of the TCR alpha-chain gene in an ataxia-telangiectasia-associated leukemia containing both a normal and an inverted chromosome 14. The normal chromosome 14 has undergone a productive join of TCR alpha-chain variable (V alpha) and joining (J alpha) gene segments. The other allele of the TCR alpha-chain gene features a DNA rearrangement, about 50 kilobases from the TCR alpha-chain constant (C alpha) gene, that represents the breakpoint of the chromosome 14 inversion; this breakpoint is comprised of a TCR J alpha segment (from 14q11) fused to sequences derived from 14q32 but on the centromeric side of C mu. These results imply that 14q32 sequences located at an undetermined distance downstream of the immunoglobulin C mu locus can contribute to the development of T-cell tumors.\r"

The amino acid sequence encoded by the C lambda 6 gene is compared with the constant region sequences of various monoclonal Bence Jones lambda proteins.

In this process segments of variable sequence information, the minicassettes, are transferred from silent storage loci into an expression locus. As a putative consequence of the rearrangement in the pilE gene, gonococci can enter a different phase of pilin production. Although the removal of a 7-amino acid leader peptide results in the production of typical P+ pilin used to form pili, the loss of an additional 39 amino acids yields S-pilin, a soluble form of pilin that is efficiently secreted into the extracellular environment. Both pilin types can coexist in an apparently homogeneous culture. Ps cells usually are piliated, although less extensively with regard to the length and the number of the pili when compared with P+ cells. Ps cells form T3/T4-type colonies also typical of nonpiliated cells (P-). The observations further suggest that the classical nonsecretory P- phenotype is not generated as a rule by precise gene conversion but rather by genetic changes that cause the production of an over-length pilin (L-pilin).\r"

The gene sequence predicts a protein with characteristics typical of the porins of other Gram-negative bacteria. A clone expressing P.I in Escherichia coli was obtained by removing a portion of the P.I gene promoter and reconstructing the entire P.I gene in a position just downstream from a phage T7 promoter. Expression of P.I was then achieved by introducing this recombinant plasmid into an E. coli strain containing an inducible T7 polymerase gene. The clone produced a protein that was identical in size to native P.I and reacted with anti-P.I monoclonal antibodies. Prolonged expression of the protein apparently was lethal for E. coli, possibly explaining failures to clone an intact P.I gene with its own promoter.\r"

A total of six RFLP, three for the constant region and three for variable region gene segments, were examined in the present studies. Most enzyme and probe combinations tested revealed no polymorphism and those finally selected for the study showed limited polymorphism in that only two or, in one case, three allelic forms of the gene were seen. In spite of limited variability at this level, extensive heterogeneity was observed for the combinations of markers present in haplotypes, suggesting that frequent recombination events have occurred. Most strikingly, multiple combinations of RFLP occurring in close proximity of the TCR alpha constant region gene were observed in this study. A high recombination frequency for the TCR alpha gene complex is further supported by the observation that two children, one in each of two families, inherited recombinant TCR alpha haplotypes.\r"

The approach is analogous to a powerful method of bacterial genetics, the random generation of operon fusions, that enables the isolation and characterization of genes simply by knowing or postulating their pattern of expression; it is not necessary initially to screen for mutant phenotypes. To apply this approach to Drosophila, we have used the expression of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli from the P-element promoter in germ-line transformant flies to screen for chromosomal elements that can act at a distance to stimulate expression from this apparently weak promoter. Of 49 transformed fly lines obtained, approximately 70% show some type of spatially regulated expression of the lacZ gene in embryos; many of these express lacZ specifically in the nervous system. The P-lacZ fusion gene is, therefore, an efficient tool for the recovery of elements that may regulate gene expression in Drosophila and for the generation of a wide variety of cell-type-specific markers.\r"

This control was concomitant with a decreased rate of transcription of the IgM gene while \"polymerase pausing\" was induced in the IgD gene. The suppression was resistant to treatment with cycloheximide, indicating that it was not caused by a labile repressor protein. The down-regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression affected only the secretory form of immunoglobulin, while the mRNA levels for the membrane-bound form of immunoglobulin remained unaltered. We conclude that the mechanisms controlling immunoglobulin gene expression in untransformed B lymphocytes differ from those operating in tumors derived from the same cell lineage.\r"

The supernatants from these activated clones induced the proliferation of highly purified resting B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood. The B cells exhibited a cell size and a surface-antigen pattern (4F2 antigen and transferrin receptor) of phase G0 B cells, and they were functionally resting. In response to T-cell supernatants a large fraction of the B cells enlarged and expressed 4F2 antigens and transferrin receptors. In gel filtration, the corresponding activity migrated with an apparent Mr of 12,000-15,000. Our findings strongly support the existence of a human B-cell-activating factor acting on resting B cells and causing them to enter phase G1 of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".U": "88097447\r", 
  ".W": "mRNAs specifying immunoglobulin mu and delta heavy chains are encoded by a single large, complex transcription unit (mu + delta gene). The transcriptional activity of delta gene segments in terminally differentiated, IgM-secreting B lymphocytes is 10-20 times lower than in earlier B-lineage cells expressing delta mRNA. We find that transcription of the mu + delta gene in IgM-secreting murine myeloma cells terminates within a region of 500-1000 nucleotides immediately following the mu membrane (mu m) polyadenylylation site. Transcription decreases only minimally through this region in murine cell lines representative of earlier stages in B-cell development. A DNA fragment containing the mu m polyadenylylation signal gives protein-DNA complexes with different mobilities in gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from myeloma cells than with nuclear extracts from earlier B-lineage cells. However, using a recently developed \"footprinting\" procedure in which protein-DNA complexes resolved in gel retardation assays are subjected to nucleolytic cleavage while still in the polyacrylamide gel, we find that the DNA sequences protected by factors from the two cell types are indistinguishable. The factor-binding site on the DNA is located 5' of the mu m polyadenylylation signal AATAAA and includes the 15-nucleotide-long A + T-rich palindrome CTGTAAACAAATGTC. This type of palindromic binding site exhibits orientation-dependent activity consistent with the reported properties of polymerase II termination signals. This binding site is followed by two sets of directly repeated DNA sequences with different helical conformation as revealed by their reactivity with the chemical nuclease 1,10-phenanthroline-copper. The close proximity of these features to the signals for mu m mRNA processing may reflect a linkage of the processes of developmentally regulated mu m polyadenylylation and transcription termination.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we reported evidence for the existence of an immunoglobulin lambda light chain (lambda x) whose variable region differs from those encoded by the known V lambda gene segments V lambda 1 and V lambda 2. Expression of lambda x was detected in some hybridomas elicited by treatment of a BALB/c mouse with rabbit anti-lambda 2 antibodies coupled to bacterial lipopolysaccharide [Sanchez, P. & Cazenave, P.-A. (1987) J. Exp. Med. 166, 265-270]. We constructed a cDNA clone from one hybridoma (B6) that expresses the lambda x chain and determined the complete nucleotide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of V lambda x is 30-33% identical with those encoded by V lambda 1 and V lambda 2 and by V kappa gene segments. The third hypervariable region of V lambda x is four codons longer than those of the other murine variable gene segments. The expression of lambda x requires a genomic rearrangement that juxtaposes the V lambda x gene with the J lambda 2-C lambda 2 joining-constant gene pair. Rabbit anti-V lambda x antibodies detected the lambda x light chain in the normal sera of all laboratory mice tested. Lambda x expression seems to be independent of lambda 1 expression, since both SJL and SJA strains, which are defective in lambda 1 production, express normal levels of lambda x chain.\r"

  ".U": "88097455\r", 
  ".W": "Four distinct human B-lymphoid cell lines possess the ability to circumvent the mechanism regulating intracellular transport of immunoglobulin protein. These cells do not produce light chains, yet they express mu heavy chains on the cell surface at comparable levels to B-cell lines that produce native forms of both proteins. The mu-chain mRNA produced in all four cell lines was found to contain an identical deletion of most of the heavy-chain variable (VH) region (75% of the 3' portion), with no apparent alteration in constant (C) region structure. The truncated mu (mu*)-chain mRNA in these cells was created through the use of a cryptic splice donor site found within the human VH gene(s) utilized by these B-cell lines. The truncated mu chains exhibited a decreased ability to associate with the intracellular transport regulatory protein, heavy-chain binding protein (BiP). This result indicates that VH region structure, in addition to C mu 1 region structure, influences the formation of the BiP recognition site on the heavy chain. Furthermore, it suggests that the mechanism allowing for cell-surface expression of the mu* chains in the absence of light-chain pairing is the inability of BiP to bind to the mu* chains and hence prevent their intracellular transport. The high frequency with which the mu-only surface immunoglobulin positive phenotype is present in our collection of human B-cell lines and the isolation of one of the cell lines from a healthy individual also suggest that B cells of this type may represent a significant subpopulation among the normal human B-cell repertoire.\r"

By using a rapid and sensitive dot-blot screening procedure based on the combination of in vitro amplification of RAS-specific sequences and oligonucleotide hybridization we additionally screened 15 myelodysplastic syndromes, 26 Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelocytic leukemias in chronic or acute phase, and 19 other chronic myeloproliferative disorders. A mutation within NRAS codon 12 could thus be demonstrated in a patient with idiopathic myelofibrosis and in another with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Moreover, mutated NRAS sequences were detected in lymphocytes, in granulocytes, as well as in monocytes/macrophages of the latter case.\r"

Using a probe for the alpha constant-region gene segments, we detected a rearranged band by Southern blot analysis. This rearranged band was cloned and mapped. A subclone free of repetitive sequences was shown to be from chromosome 19 by analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, confirming that the rearranged band contains the translocation breakpoint junction. This probe may be used to identify a gene on chromosome 19 adjacent to the breakpoint that can contribute to the malignant development of B lymphocytes.\r"

The posttherapy lung scans were compared with baseline, pretherapy scans with use of two semiquantitative methods--an anteroposterior view method, similar to that used in the Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial, and a segmental method that emphasized pulmonary anatomy. There was an improvement in the defect score from 0.35 to 0.14 (P less than .01) when the anteroposterior view method was used and from 0.37 to 0.16 (P less than .01) when the segmental method was used. These encouraging results in the early posttherapy period suggest that rt-PA is especially effective in improving regional perfusion after pulmonary embolism and that a larger controlled trial of therapy with rt-PA for acute pulmonary embolism should be performed. Scoring lung scans with a segmental method is feasible and appropriate for present-day lung scan technique and should be considered in future studies.\r"

Treatment of hypogonadal women with an antagonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone substantially decreased serum FSH bioactivity with minimal changes in immunoreactivity. Chromatofocusing and size fractionation of the serum samples indicated the secretion of immunoreactive FSH isoforms that are devoid of bioactivity but that are capable of blocking FSH action in ovarian granulosa cells. These findings provide the first demonstration of naturally occurring circulating antihormones. These FSH antagonists may play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the gonads.\r"

Later, it is transiently expressed in a specific subset of neuronal precursor cells, neurons (such as aCC, pCC, RP1, and RP2), and glia in the developing central nervous system (CNS). The function of ftz in the CNS was determined by creating ftz mutant embryos that express ftz in the blastoderm stripes but not in the CNS. In the absence of ftz CNS expression, some neurons appear normal (for example, the aCC, pCC, and RP1), whereas the RP2 neuron extends its growth cone along an abnormal pathway, mimicking its sibling (RP1), suggesting a transformation in neuronal identity.\r"

  ".W": "Tau protein is a family of microtubule binding proteins, heterogeneous in molecular weight, that are induced during neurite outgrowth and are found prominently in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The predicted amino acid sequences of two forms of tau protein from mouse brain were determined from complementary DNA clones. These forms are identical in their amino-terminal sequences but differ in their carboxyl-terminal domains. Both proteins contain repeated sequences that may be tubulin binding sites. The sequence suggests that tau is an elongated molecule with no extensive alpha-helical or beta-sheet domains. These complementary DNAs should enable the study of various functional domains of tau and the study of tau expression in normal and pathological states.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of prolactin on lactation and reproductive organs are well known. However, the other possible target organs and physiological consequences of altered levels of circulating prolactin remain poorly understood. In this study, mice were treated with bromocryptine, a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits pituitary prolactin secretion. Bromocryptine treatment prevented T-cell-dependent induction of macrophage tumoricidal activity after the intraperitoneal injection of Listeria monocytogenes or Mycobacterium bovis. Coincident treatment with ovine prolactin reversed this effect. Of the multiple events leading to macrophage activation in vivo, the production by T-lymphocytes of gamma-interferon was the most impaired in bromocryptine-treated mice. Lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with mitogens in vitro was also depressed in spleens of bromocryptine-treated mice, and coadministration of prolactin also reversed this effect. Bromocryptine treatment also reduced the number of deaths resulting from inoculation of mice with Listeria; exogenous prolactin significantly reversed this effect. The critical influence of pituitary prolactin release on maintenance of lymphocyte function and on lymphokine-dependent macrophage activation suggests that, in mice, lymphocytes are an important target tissue for circulating prolactin.\r"

This study compared the metabolic effects of administering standard amino acid solutions with a solution enriched with branched chain amino acids (BCAA). A prospective, randomized clinical study was performed in patients who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy or hemicolectomy, and subsequently cared for in the metabolic care unit. The patients were selected from specific entry criteria so that two groups of individuals were comparable. All patients underwent operation without complications. The plasma concentrations of valine and leucine were significantly increased (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) two days after administration of solutions enriched with BCAA and throughout the entire postoperative period. The plasma glutamine concentrations tended to decrease in both groups; no concentration difference occurred between groups. Nitrogen balance tended to be more positive in the group receiving BCAA but there was no significant difference between groups after operation. Urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine tended to increase postoperatively in both groups, but no difference occurred between groups. However, the urine excretion of isoleucine increased significantly in the patients receiving infusions enriched with BCAA. Both standard balanced amino acid and amino solutions enriched with BCAA were well tolerated in all patients.\r"

Bolus injection of endotoxin (20 units per kilogram of body weight) to four volunteers resulted in peak serum cachetin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels of 358 +/- 166 picograms per milliliter within 90 minutes after challenge (p less than 0.05 versus base line) and peak serum interleukin-1 levels of 2.14 +/- 0.89 units per milliliter within two hours after challenge. By contrast, the infusion of a lethal dose of live Escherichia coli to four baboons revealed peak serum cachectin/TNF levels of 20,500 +/- 9,890 picograms per milliliter within 90 minutes after bacteria were given (p less than 0.05 versus base line) and peak interleukin-1 levels of 14.2 +/- 10.1 units per milliliter three hours after bacterial challenge. No detectable monokine levels were observed in either model six hours after challenge. Interferon-gamma levels reached a peak of 2.67 +/- 1.66 nanograms per milliliter in baboon sera at eight hours after bacterial infusion and was no longer detectable by 12 hours. Interferon-gamma was not detected in the sera of humans. These results suggest that the transient release of cachectin/TNF, followed by interleukin-1 and interferon-gamma, may participate in the cascade of events noted in overwhelming bacterial invasion.\r"

The relationship between the organisms was studied by determining the individual change in colony-forming units (CFUs) of the two bacterial components that induces abscesses in mice, compared to the CFUs of each of the isolated when inoculated alone. Of the eleven combinations, the CFUs of S. faecalis increased in seven and decreased in two. The CFUs of anaerobic bacteria were never increased and were decreased in two. A mutual decrease in growth occurred only in the combinations of S. faecalis and B. melaninogenicus group. This study demonstrates the potential for pathogenicity of S. faecalis in mixed infections with the B. fragilis group and anaerobic cocci.\r"

The study included 31 patients with obstructive jaundice (bilirubin, 3 mg/dl or higher) randomly allocated in two groups to receive (n = 17) or not receive (n = 14) preoperative mannitol. Sixty-five percent of patients had a creatinine clearance below 70 ml/min before surgery. Serum bilirubin and bacteribilia had no relation with preoperative renal function. No relation was found between serum bilirubin value and the percentage fall in postoperative creatinine clearance. Compared with the preoperative values, the postoperative creatinine clearance was significantly impaired in the mannitol group (p = 0.03) and remained almost unaltered in the no-mannitol group. Three patients (9.7%) died of acute renal failure; two were in the mannitol group and one was in the no-mannitol group. Serum fibrin degradation products were not sensitive markers for impending renal failure. There was no significant difference in postoperative serum sodium concentration or in the urinary sodium excretion. Administration of mannitol did not improve the postoperative renal function of jaundiced patients, nor did it prove beneficial in preventing renal failure. Our results suggest that severe disturbances of body-fluid compartments may be the basic mechanism underlying kidney dysfunction in obstructive jaundice and that further water depletion induced by mannitol may indeed prove detrimental.\r"

After 10 days of nutritional depletion (nothing by mouth; 5% dextrose with electrolytes administered intravenously) animals were randomized to receive one of four TPN diets for 10 days. The depletion/repletion cycle was repeated, after 1 month of caged free feeding, until all animals had received the four TPN diets. Two levels of nonprotein caloric intake (155% and 100% of primate resting energy expenditure) and two levels of nitrogen intake (200% and 100% of primate nitrogen requirement) were used to make the four different diets. Nitrogen balance (p = 0.01) and serum total iron-binding capacity response (p = 0.02) were significantly influenced by the level of nitrogen intake but not by nonprotein calorie intake, which significantly influenced only weight gain (p = 0.03). Fluid balance was not significantly different for any diet. Fat and protein stores may be selectively repleted in this model by adjusting the nonprotein calorie and nitrogen content of TPN.\r"

Both agents at both doses caused similar baseline bronchodilatation, confirming the presence of resting bronchomotor tone. The overall mean increases as percentages of control were 33% in specific airway conductance (sGaw), 10% in maximal flow after expiration of 50% of vital capacity, and 3.7% in FEV1. Hypocapnia (mean end tidal carbon dioxide tension 2.2 kPa) was produced by three minutes of voluntary hyperventilation and resulted in a mean fall in sGaw of 0.49 s-1 kPa-1 (20%). After inhalation of 0.25 mg salbutamol hypocapnic hyperventilation still produced a mean fall in sGaw of 0.55 s-1 kPa-1, whereas salbutamol 2.5 mg reduced this response to 0.15 s-1 kPa-1 (6%). After both doses of ipratropium the decrease in sGaw caused by hyperventilation was similar to the control. This suggests that bronchoconstriction in response to hypocapnic hyperventilation in normal subjects is not mediated via a cholinergic reflex.\r"

Vasodilator responses to induced hypercapnia were tested during inhalation of 5% CO2 in 95% O2 while regional cerebral blood flow was measured by fluoromethane inhalation positron emission tomography. Mean RES% for 24 normal MCA territories was 5.2 +/- 0.8%. Mean RES% for 15 patient nonischemic MCA territories was 3.8 +/- 1.3% and for 15 ischemic MCA territories was 2.8 +/- 1.9% (both p less than 0.001). Individual RES% values and symmetry ratios between ischemic and nonischemic regions were also determined and compared with angiographic data. Areas of diminished, asymmetric, or paradoxical (two patients) CO2 reactivity appear to correspond to areas of compensatory vasodilation. We found this technique to be a safe and reproducible method for defining and recording localized areas of cerebral tissue at apparent risk for hemodynamically related damage.\r"

  ".W": "Diltiazem given 48 hours before experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage protects the cerebral vasculature of monkeys against the widespread cerebrovascular spasm seen on angiography after 5-6 days and against associated neurologic defects. In vitro examination of the cerebral arteries from treated monkeys shows that compared with untreated animals, the functional changes in the vascular smooth muscle cells, the increase in arterial wall stiffness, and the decrease in contractility, all of which were prominent in untreated monkeys, were relatively small. Other changes such as abnormal spontaneous myogenic tone, decreased responsiveness to constrictor and dilator nerve activation, and other indexes of neuronal function were little influenced by the drug. We suggest that chronic cerebrovasospasm may be initiated by the combined action of exceptionally high concentrations of a number of putative spasmogens causing injury to the larger cerebral arteries. However, the later development of intractable spasm is related to the location of blood clot and to the involvement of the vascular wall in an inflammatory process. The combined insult results in pathologic changes in the artery wall resulting in increased thickness and stiffness. Diltiazem acts on cerebrovascular smooth muscle in lower concentrations than on smooth muscle in other vascular beds, interfering with calcium entry through receptor-operated and potential-sensitive channels, and may protect against calcium-induced cell death through these and additional actions. Protection against early events presumably prevents the genesis of the subsequent chronic state.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1974 and 1978, 258 patients with clinical Stage C adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston. Of these, 208 were considered evaluable for a review of the impact of transurethral resection (TUR) on the dissemination of disease. After TUR, the incidence of disease progression was 38.9 per cent, compared with 36.4 per cent for patients who did not undergo TUR. There were significant differences in both incidence of progression (31.2% versus 55.6%, p = 0.002) and time to progression (p less than 0.001) when patients were divided into Stages C1 and C2 (presence or absence of pelvic side wall fixation) irrespective of their TUR status. Therefore, it appears that for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, the degree of tumor burden and not the TUR status has a significant influence on disease progression.\r"

The glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA clearance) increased from the follicular to the luteal phase by a median of 7.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.7-10.3%). Endogenous overnight (22.00-08.00 hours) creatinine clearance increased by a median of 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 1.0-14.6%). The urinary creatinine excretion rate also increased with a median of 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 1.5-11.9%) whereas the serum concentrations of creatinine and beta 2-microglobulin, urine flow and urinary excretion rate of urea did not change. The results confirm previous observations of an increase in creatinine clearance in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and indicate that the increase in overnight creatinine clearance reflects a true change in glomerular filtration rate.\r"

By evaluating the antihypertensive effects of ritanserin the aim of this investigation was to indirectly elucidate the mechanism of action of ketanserin. Thirteen patients with essential hypertension were treated with placebo and ritanserin, 10 mg b.i.d., in a double-blind, cross-over design (4-week periods). At the end of the treatment periods blood pressure as well as plasma concentrations of ritanserin were evaluated for 24 hours. Despite high steady state and peak plasma concentrations of ritanserin the compound did not lower the blood pressure compared with placebo. Since chronic selective 5-HT2-receptor blockade by means of ritanserin did not lower the blood pressure, it is concluded that the 5-HT2 blocking properties of ketanserin cannot alone be responsible for the antihypertensive effects of ketanserin.\r"

The incidence of endocarditis in this group of patients was only 0.4% as compared to 4.7% in other patients with staphylococcal bacteremia (p less than 0.01). The lower incidence of endocarditis complicating bacteremia in these patients may justify a shorter course of therapy than usually recommended for suspected endocarditis. Patients with hematological malignancies and other patients with agranulocytosis had a higher mortality (49 and 46%, respectively) than other patients with S. aureus bacteremia (33%). The highest mortality was found in patients with multiple myeloma (71%, p less than 0.01), the lowest in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (28%, p less than 0.01). The higher mortality in these patients may indicate that empiric antibiotic regimens in granulocytopenic patients should include a specific anti-staphylococcal agent.\r"

Successful recanalization of the infarct vessel was achieved in 46 (92%) patients after therapy with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, or both. Follow-up angiography in 44 showed early reocclusion in 10 patients (23%). Intermittent patency during acute arteriography was always associated with reocclusion; suboptimal (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] class 2) flow was associated with a 50% rate of reocclusion. Although residual stenosis of greater than 50% alone was not predictive of rethrombosis, 90% of all reocclusions were associated with either stenosis greater than 50%, TIMI 2 flow, or intermittent patency. Absence of these angiographic risk factors predicted a 95% patency rate at follow-up. In-hospital cardiac complications occurred in 17 of 23 (74%) patients with residual stenosis of greater than 50% (death in four, ischemia in 13), and late revascularization was required in 53% of survivors. Only 15% of the group with less than 50% stenosis had an in-hospital ischemic event (p less than 0.001). Thus, after acute intervention, an infarct vessel with intermittent patency or suboptimal flow is associated with a high rate of reocclusion. Residual stenosis greater than or equal to 50% appears to predict a high incidence of negative in-hospital clinical outcomes and the need for subsequent revascularization.\r"

Endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 32 subjects. Results from six were normal. Ventricular failure in the other 26 was idiopathic (n = 15), familial (n = 3), alcohol induced (n = 5), or related to doxorubicin therapy (n = 3). The biopsies were analyzed for total, mitochondrial, Na+-K+, Ca++, and Mg++ ATPase activities. Total and mitochondrial ATPase activities correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.65 and 0.67, respectively; both p = 0.0001). Residual Mg++ ATPase activity correlated weakly with ventricular function as measured by echocardiography (p = 0.05). Na+-K+ ATPase activity was depressed in patients receiving digitalis (p = 0.01). These results suggest that progressive ventricular dysfunction may be associated with a progressive loss of total ATPase, mitochondrial ATPase and, to a lesser extent, Mg++ ATPase activity. Although depressed mitochondrial ATPase activity is not likely to be the primary cause of ventricular dysfunction, it could perpetuate failure by leading to inadequate production of adenosine triphosphate. Further study of ATPase activities may provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of cardiac failure.\r"

Both drugs significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered pulmonary artery wedge pressure and blood pressure and increased cardiac output. Isosorbide dinitrate required fewer retitration episodes and less increases in dosage than nitroglycerin at 24 hours. In the patient with acute myocardial infarction complicated by high pulmonary artery wedge pressure who requires intravenous nitrates for 24 hours, isosorbide dinitrate may offer the benefit of a more stable hemodynamic effect.\r"

Concomitant antianginal medications were permitted. Entry criteria required reproducible exercise times to both onset of angina and 1 mm of ST-segment depression.

All patches were worn only from 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. daily. Exercise testing was repeated before patch application and then 4 and 8 hours after application on both the first and the last day of each treatment arm. Eleven patients completed the randomized crossover phase. Exercise time to the onset of angina and to the onset of 1 mm of ST-segment depression was significantly prolonged during the first day of therapy at both 4 and 8 hours after active nitroglycerin patch application compared with placebo (p less than 0.01). During sustained use, the benefit at 4 and 8 hours after nitroglycerin patch application was still evident (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively).

By substituting MgCl2 for MgSO4 in an amino acid infusate for parenteral nutrition, we were able to examine prospectively the effect of an altered SO4 load on S metabolism. In comparing 21 low-birthweight infants on the experimental MgC2 infusate with 14 subjects on the control MgSO4 infusate, we observed a 40% decrease in urinary excretion of free SO4 and a 31% decrease in excretion of total acid-labile sulfoesters.

At 7 d the mean ketone body concentration in the blood of patients fed the ketogenic diet was 1.21 +/- 0.33 mM. This ketosis was associated with a significant reduction of the concentration in blood of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate (p less than 0.05).

Five subjects, maintained on formula diets, received L-[13C1]lysine (27 mumol/kg) as an IV bolus and L-[15N2]lysine (27 mumol/kg) as an oral bolus 4 h postprandially. Milk samples were collected at 30, 45, 90, 150, 240, and 360 min. Tracer lysine levels in the hydrolysate of unfractionated milk protein were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry isotope ratiometry. After a delay of at least 45 min, significant labeling of milk protein was detected and reached a maximum at 150 min with cumulative percent does recovery over 6 h of 0.5%. Human-milk proteins can be labeled for nutritional investigations and in vivo kinetics of milk protein synthesis can be studied with stable isotope techniques.\r"

Peak hydrogen production after a milk-based food supplement was delayed 2 h as compared with a lactose solution. Addition of a breakfast meal further delayed peak hydrogen production by 1 h. Hydrogen production was significantly lower (p less than 0.03) for the first 4 h after ingestion of the supplement plus meal compared with the supplement alone. Nine subjects experienced intolerance symptoms after consumption of the supplement alone but only three experienced them after consumption of the meal plus supplement. Severity of symptoms was significantly reduced with the ingestion of the supplement compared with an equal lactose load and was further reduced with the consumption of food, presumably due to delayed gastric emptying. Thus, lactose malabsorbers should consume food simultaneously with lactose-containing beverages to reduce intolerance symptoms.\r"

A peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) sequence for the demonstration of type IV collagen has been applied to routinely processed paraffin-embedded sections of these specimens. Blood vascular structures of all calibers were clearly demonstrated, as were lymphatic sinuses. Structures recognizable as the latter were generally lacking in HD, but the sinus structures in the cases of RFH were well defined. Blood vessels were highly active on type IV collagen staining in the interfollicular areas of reactive nodes but were relatively scanty in lymphocyte-predominant, mixed-cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted HD. However, in the nodular sclerosing Rye subtype, blood vessels containing type IV collagen were as numerous as in RFH and could be seen within and around the cellular nodules. A similar number of type IV collagen-containing blood vessels were also apparent in the cellular variant of nodular sclerosing HD. The results are compared with those obtained on immunostaining for Factor VIII-related antigen and on binding of Ulex europaeus lectin I, and type IV collagen is considered to be the most sensitive vascular marker compared with these.\r"

Gastric secretions were recovered in 15-min fractions for the ensuing 2 h, and the pH, H+ concentration and output, volume, and pepsin concentration and output were determined. Doses of 150 mg and 300 mg nizatidine depressed the secretory response significantly more than did cimetidine. The antisecretory effects of 75 mg nizatidine was no different than that of 300 mg cimetidine. Nizatidine 300 mg inhibited pepsin output significantly more than volume. Although pepsin concentration was reduced more than volume, the difference was not significant. These observations, in contrast to results of previous studies, suggest a direct inhibition of pepsin secretion, although to a lesser extent than that of acid.\r"

A retrospective study in 17 patients revealed a high incidence of biliary stasis during the early postoperative period and improvement by the initiation of enteral nutrition. Furthermore, the contractility of the gallbladder recovered remarkably soon after the operation. This first randomized prospective study concerning prophylaxis of biliary stasis in 26 patients showed that postoperative biliary stasis was prevented by early initiation of enteral nutrition.\r"

Patient demographic data, along with ESRD etiology and comorbid conditions noted by the physician, were compared across various modalities of dialysis. Characteristics of the treatment provided were differentiated by the mode of dialysis and the location of the patient encounter. Results of the analysis show that patients on peritoneal dialysis are more likely to be female and have higher rates of diabetes compared with hemodialysis (HD) patients. Statistically, patients on intermittent peritoneal dialysis are older, more likely to be black, and have a higher incidence of cardiovascular conditions. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients have greatest problem severity and require more physician time and more complex services, whereas home HD patients require the greatest number of diagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures. Hospital inpatient care shows greater case-mix severity and more intensive treatment, but this does not differ by the mode of dialysis. Finally, patients of freestanding dialysis facilities are more likely to have hypertensive renal disease, whereas patients at hospital-based facilities are older, more likely to be seen in the hospital, have more urgent and severe problems during dialysis rounds, and require more physician time, more complex services, and more diagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures.\r"

Two variants detected by MspI and SstI were in strong linkage disequilibrium; but when conventional statistical tests were used, a third variant (PstI), located between the MspI and SstI markers, appeared to be in linkage equilibrium with these two \"outside\" markers. Similar discrepancies from the expected monotone relationship between physical distance and linkage disequilibrium have been reported by others. To investigate these discrepancies, the power to detect linkage disequilibrium was calculated. It could be shown that, for the gene frequencies encountered, very large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate negative (i.e., repulsion-phase) linkage disequilibrium. Such numbers are usually very difficult to attain in human studies. Failure to demonstrate linkage disequilibrium by conventional methods therefore does not imply its absence. Appropriate nomograms and tables are provided.\r"

Patients receiving both total parenteral nutrition and parenteral H2-receptor antagonists may benefit from receiving the drug in combination with the total parenteral nutrition admixture. Parenteral cimetidine and ranitidine are stable in various total parenteral nutrition fluids. Clinically, cimetidine has been studied more extensively than ranitidine.

Twelve patients had clinical symptoms, and five died with hepatitis being the cause of death in two and a contributing factor in three. Liver biopsy specimens showed early chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. In addition to increases in liver enzymes, 13 patients had increases in alkaline phosphatase levels. All but two patients who contracted hepatitis had been given 50 mg/kg per week or more of intravenous immunoglobulin. Lymphocyte counts, T/B cell ratios, and T-lymphocyte function did not differ between those in whom hepatitis developed and those in whom it did not develop. The hepatitis was associated with more than one batch of a Swedish intravenous immunoglobulin, the immunoglobulin being derived from United States sources as well as from European plasma. Three previous brief reports in the literature have also associated non-A, non-B hepatitis with the intravenous infusion of various immunoglobulins. Biologic materials given to patients, including immunoglobulin, should, whenever possible, be prepared so as to ensure absence of viruses.\r"

The mean preoperative level of ANP was 75 +/- 18 pg/ml, which was found to be significantly higher than the normal range for this laboratory (8 to 24 pg/ml) (p less than 0.05). This value was also significantly higher than the value of 21 +/- 5 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) obtained in six patients with cirrhosis but without ascites. Following shunt insertion, an immediate natriuresis and diuresis were observed in five of the six cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. In these five, right atrial pressure and ANP rose immediately, followed by a rise in the level of urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The sixth subject had a delayed rise in right atrial pressure, and correspondingly the rise in ANP, the diuresis, and natriuresis were delayed. The changes in ANP following PVS were positively correlated with changes in right atrial pressure (p less than 0.05), urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (p less than 0.05), urinary sodium excretion (p less than 0.05), and urine volume (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that ANP may be important in mediating the acute response to PVS.\r"

The mean pretreatment glucose level was 190 +/- 69 mg/dl and rose to 397 +/- 163 mg/dl after one month of encainide therapy in patients in whom hyperglycemia developed (p less than 0.025). The glucose level was 111 +/- 27 mg/dl in nonhyperglycemic patients before encainide administration and 108 +/- 22 mg/dl after one month of encainide therapy (p = NS). There was no difference in age or encainide dosage between hyperglycemic and nonhyperglycemic patients. Treatment for hyperglycemia was given during four of the five encainide treatment periods in hyperglycemic patients. Encainide was discontinued in each of the five hyperglycemic episodes; therapeutic requirements for hyperglycemia markedly decreased. Hypoglycemic reactions to insulin occurred in two patients when encainide was stopped. Thus, encainide exacerbates hyperglycemia in some patients. These patients usually have mild hyperglycemia not requiring therapy before administration of encainide but may require insulin while receiving encainide. Treatment requirements for hyperglycemia decrease following withdrawal of encainide. The mechanism of this effect and the consequences of long-term encainide therapy on glucose metabolism are unknown.\r"

She previously had been unresponsive to courses of therapy with steroids, vincristine, and splenectomy. When treatment with danazol and purified immunoglobulins was unsuccessful in controlling her rapidly progressive course, an 8-day plasma exchange procedure was initiated in combination with platelet transfusion therapy and immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and vincristine. Within 2 days, her clinical state improved markedly, correlating with a drop in her serum antiplatelet antibody level. She continued to improve and was discharged on a regimen of cyclophosphamide and danazol. Her antiplatelet antibody level had fallen to within the normal range, despite a typical platelet count of 5,000/microL during the 8-day period. Two weeks later her platelet count rose to 65,000/microL. This case suggests that a course of therapeutic plasma exchange may have a temporizing role in the acute management of life-threatening chronic ITP relapse, generating time for the more definitive therapy of immunosuppression to take effect.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-five patients who had been started on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) more than 1 year previously were surveyed to determine the difference between those who had continued and those who had discontinued CSII. These retrospective results were used to determine characteristics that predict a suitable candidate for CSII which could be tested in a future prospective study and would guide our clinical choice of candidates for CSII. Twenty patients had discontinued CSII (Group D) and 35 patients had continued CSII (Group C). Group D contained younger patients, more likely to be women who had had a shorter duration of diabetes, more frequent antecedent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and more frequent doctor visits. The major rationale for starting CSII in Group D was poor control with keotacidosis whereas Group C started CSII for poor control with hypoglycemia. The reasons for stopping CSII in Group D were interference with lifestyle (40%), needle site abcesses (40%), psychological rejection (10%), and poor insulin absorption (10%). Group D patients had a significantly higher incidence of psychological rejection of CSII, dermatological problems, and needle site abcesses. For patients in Group D, glycosylated hemoglobin levels during CSII were similar to those prior to CSII. Group C patients had improved glycosylated hemoglobin levels and were more satisfied with CSII despite a slightly higher incidence of pump runaway. Group C patients had a trend toward more frequent hypoglycemia while on CSII; however, in patients who had reported severe hypoglycemia before starting CSII, there was a significant decline in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine predictors of postoperative morbidity in elective cholecystectomy patients, the authors examined prospectively the consequences of age, sex, active and past smoking, respiratory history, obesity, type of surgical incision, and preoperative pulmonary function, upon the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and length of hospitalization. They identified 31 (14.8%) complications in 209 patients; 21 had atelectasis, 8 purulent bronchitis, and 2 pneumonia. These patients averaged 1.5 days longer in the hospital (p less than 0.001 by analysis of variance) than control patients. Abnormal spirometry (MEFV) and the single-breath nitrogen test (SBN2) were significant predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications (p less than 0.001 by discriminant analysis method). Active smoking and history of respiratory disease were associated with abnormal small airway function (p less than 0.001 by chisquare test), but did not predict postoperative morbidity. By analysis of variance, only a reduction in preoperative FVC emerged as predictive of prolonged hospitalization (p less than 0.001). These results were used to determine if the selection of patients by preoperative pulmonary function testing permits more cost-effective administration of respiratory therapy (RT) services. Neither the MEFV nor SBN2 had sufficient specificity to enhance the cost effectiveness of postoperative RT.\r"

Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling now enables access to the fetal circulation and thereby allows more precise evaluation of fetal anemia and direct intravascular transfusion. A variation of this technique was used in three pregnancies complicated by fetal pericardial effusion, scalp edema, and abdominal ascites before 26 weeks' gestation. Twelve ultrasound-guided percutaneous transfusions of 30 to 85 ml packed red blood cells were administered into the umbilical cord at its placental insertion. In each fetus the hydropic changes completely resolved and pregnancy outcome was successful. Neither adjunctive therapy with digoxin or Lasix nor exchange transfusions were used. Percutaneous umbilical transfusions appear to have the potential to improve the prognosis for the severely isoimmunized fetus.\r"

  ".W": "The early hormonal changes that lead to follicular maturation and/or hyperstimulation in women requiring ovulation induction with either human menopausal gonadotropin or gonadotropin-releasing hormone have not been elucidated. This study was undertaken to assess the relative contribution of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone to estradiol secretion and follicular maturation in patients receiving human menopausal gonadotropin or gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The study group consisted of 10 women (26 to 38 years of age) with secondary amenorrhea as a result of hypothalamic dysfunction who had failed to ovulate when given clomiphene citrate. The patients were randomly assigned to either human menopausal gonadotropin (n = 5) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (n = 5) treatment. On day 5 after the onset of induced menses, all women had baseline blood samples obtained at 10-minute intervals for 4 hours. At this time either 150 U of human menopausal gonadotropin or 75 ng/kg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone administered hourly was given, and blood sampling every 10 minutes was continued for an additional 6 hours. Thereafter, patients were evaluated daily until ovulation. A significant and sustained increase in the mean plasma follicle-stimulating hormone level was first measured during the third hour after human menopausal gonadotropin administration (p less than 0.05. The area under the curve of the mean plasma follicle-stimulating hormone value after this initial increase was significantly greater than its baseline (2119 +/- 240 versus 1425 +/- 188 mlU/ml; p less than 0.01). This rise in mean follicle-stimulating hormone level was followed in less than 2 hours by a significant and uniform rise in mean plasma estradiol concentration (p less than 0.05). In contrast, no immediate change in the mean levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or estradiol occurred after gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. The mean daily levels of luteinizing hormone were similar in both groups; however, mean daily follicle-stimulating hormone (20.0 +/- 1.1 versus 9.2 +/- 1.4 mlU/ml) and estradiol (1004 +/- 174 versus 495 +/- 83 pg/ml) levels were significantly higher in patients treated with human menopausal gonadotropin than in those treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively). In addition, only in patients receiving human menopausal gonadotropin was a positive correlation found between mean daily plasma estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (r = 0.685, p less than 0.05) levels and between mean daily plasma estradiol and prolactin (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001) levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Each subject received a dose between 50 and 800 mg RU 486 on days 6 to 8 after the luteinizing hormone surge and blood samples were taken over the following 48 hours. Another group of five patients received a single oral dose of 200 mg RU 486 and blood sampling was extended for 14 days. Menses were induced in all women but one within 3 days after RU 486 administration. Two distinct patient populations emerged. In nine of the subjects, there was a single bleeding episode and the treatment cycle was significantly shorter (p less than 0.05) than the following cycle. In 16 of these 25 patients a second bleeding episode occurred 19.0 +/- 0.8 days after the luteinizing hormone surge. The total treatment cycle was significantly prolonged (p less than 0.05) when compared with the following cycle. In the group with a single bleeding episode, there was a significant decline in follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, and progesterone over the 48-hour sampling period, but there was no change in these values in the group with two bleeding episodes. These two groups could not be separated on the basis of RU 486 dose or serum levels. After the four higher doses, there was a dose-dependent rise in serum prolactin. There were no alterations in mean cortisol values with the three lower doses, but there was a significant increase at 24 and 48 hours after the higher doses. Serum levels of RU 486 were maximal between 1 and 4 hours and the half-life of serum RU 486 was determined to be 24 hours.\r"

  ".W": "RU 486, a synthetic steroid with antiprogesterone receptor activity, was used to investigate the importance of progesterone on gonadotropin secretory dynamics in the midcycle of the normal menstrual cycle. Six normally cycling women were followed for three consecutive cycles. During each cycle, blood samples were obtained beginning on day 10 and continued until menses. After a control cycle, 100 mg RU 486 was given orally between days 10 and 17. The patients were followed for a posttreatment cycle with no medication. When RU 486 was given before the midcycle, the luteinizing hormone surge was delayed by 15.0 +/- 2.1 days after ingestion of the last pill, resulting in cycles of 40.6 +/- 2.6 compared with 28.0 +/- 2.3 days (p less than 0.01). During RU 486 administration and at the time a normal luteinizing hormone surge was anticipated, an attenuated luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone surge was noted that was not followed by a rise in progesterone. After the attenuated surge a normal luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone level occurred, with a normal rise in progesterone. Estradiol levels during RU 486 administration decreased during treatment, indicating a possible direct action of RU 486 on the ovary.\r"

Immunocytochemical studies that used monoclonal antibodies against class I (HLA-A, B, and C) antigens revealed that both cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts can express HLA heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin. Expression of these antigens increased with time in culture. The addition of recombinant gamma-interferon (1000 U/ml) to the cultures significantly increased cellular staining for these antigens over controls throughout the 72-hour time course studied. In addition, we noted that gene expression for HLA class I heavy chain was also markedly augmented by the addition of gamma-interferon. Expression of class II (HLA-DR) antigens was not detected in any of the experiments. These results suggest that during in vitro differentiation, cytotrophoblasts can express class I HLA antigens and the genes controlling their production can be regulated. Alterations in the expression or suppression of these antigens during pregnancy could be responsible for some pregnancy complications.\r"

Group 1 all exhibited nonperiodic fetal heart rate decelerations, without the classical appearance of early, late, or variable decelerations, and four of the six had fetal bradycardia. In three group 1 cases, there was no active intervention because of early gestational age, and fetal death occurred at 23, 27, and 27 weeks, respectively. The other three patients in group 1 received betamethasone and were delivered by cesarean section at 28 to 30 weeks. There were no cases of respiratory distress syndrome or neonatal death. Five of the six infants in group 1 were small for gestational age. The nonperiodic fetal heart rate decelerations were absent in both groups 2 and 3 who all had normal fetal outcomes at term. The abnormal finding of women with nonperiodic fetal heart rate decelerations at 20 to 28 weeks may detect the fetus at risk for intrauterine death in pregnancies complicated by systemic lupus erythematosus or circulating anticoagulant. Continued surveillance, steroid induction of lung maturity, and delivery should be considered in these cases.\r"

Because of the prolonged waiting time, expense, and operative risk, we have treated a group of women with empiric human menopausal gonadotropins/human chorionic gonadotropin before in vitro fertilization. A study group of 97 couples with well-documented, long-standing idiopathic infertility received up to four cycles of empiric human menopausal gonadotropin therapy before in vitro fertilization. This group was compared with a control group of 48 couples who did not receive human menopausal gonadotropin before in vitro fertilization. The 12 (12.4%) conceptions and eight (8.2%) term births resulting from empiric human menopausal gonadotropin therapy in the study group was significantly higher than the number of spontaneous conceptions and births (1%) in the study group (p less than 0.003) and was also greater than the spontaneous conception and birth rate (4%) in the control group (p less than 0.07). The conception rate with empiric human menopausal gonadotropin (12.4%) compared favorably with that after in vitro fertilization (7.9%) and 8 of 12 (66.7%) of empiric human menopausal gonadotropin conceptions resulted in term births, compared with two of seven (28.6%) of the in vitro fertilization conceptions. Preovulatory serum estradiol levels were similar for all study patients undergoing empiric human menopausal gonadotropin therapy, control patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, and patients receiving empiric human menopausal gonadotropin during conception cycles. It therefore appears appropriate to offer a 4-month trial of empiric human menopausal gonadotropin to that specific group of couples with long-standing idiopathic infertility.\r"

Umbilical arterial blood was more acidotic and had a greater base deficit, while the umbilical venous PO2 was 4.8 mm Hg higher in the samples with adult hemoglobins than in those with fetal hemoglobin.

  ".U": "88103974\r", 
  ".W": "A group of 63 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (variants of diffuse large cell lymphomas often diagnosed as \"malignant histiocytosis\") was characterized on both morphologic criteria and expression of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and Ki-1 antigen (CD30). On the basis of the reactivity of these tumors with anti-EMA and anti-Ki-1 antibodies, four subtypes could be distinguished. In the majority of cases (n = 49), neoplastic cells coexpressed EMA and Ki-1 antigens. Nineteen of these cases were tested for IL-2R, and all were positive (Type I, EMA+, Ki-1+, IL-2R+). In the second group (n = 5), the neoplastic cells expressed EMA but not the Ki-1 antigen. These cases were not tested for the presence of IL-2R (Type II, EMA+, Ki-1-, IL-2R?). There were tumors with similar morphology expressing only Ki-1 antigen (Type III, EMA-, Ki-1+, IL-2R-) or negative for both EMA and Ki-1 antigens (Type IV, EMA-, Ki-1-, IL-2R-). EMA appeared to occur predominantly on activated cells, as has been previously shown for Ki-1 antigen. Analysis using monoclonal antibodies to T-cell, B-cell, or macrophage-associated differentiation antigens showed that these tumors were heterogeneous in terms of cell lineage. Tumors coexpressing EMA, Ki-1, and IL-2R (Type I), were most commonly of T-cell origin (n = 12); the remainder in this type expressed B-cell markers (n = 4), a mixed B/T phenotype (n = 2), or no clear phenotype (n = 9). By contrast, tumors of Types II, III, and IV were mainly from B-cell origin (n = 6) or showed a mixed B/T phenotype (n = 1). Despite the fact that a significant proportion of these cases were initially classified morphologically as \"malignant histiocytosis,\" only 3 of the 63 cases were possibly of histiocytic origin. These results confirm that true malignant histiocytosis is rare and that most tumors with histologic features currently regarded as being consistent with this diagnosis are lymphocytic in origin and express activation antigens such as EMA, Ki-1 antigen, and IL-2R.\r"

  ".W": "The authors administered the growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) stimulation test to 19 patients with major depression and 19 age- and sex-matched control subjects to test the hypothesis that a blunted growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine reflects a central alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subsensitivity in depression. GH response to GRF was significantly higher in patients with depression than in control subjects. This group difference was mainly attributable to three of the 19 depressed patients who exhibited markedly high GH responses to GRF. These results suggest that the blunted GH response to clonidine seen in patients with depression is not due to a pituitary defect in GH secretion.\r"

Compared with resection, operative morbidity and mortality rates were lower, length of hospitalization was shorter, and the cost of treatment was lower. There was no significant difference in survival. In choosing candidates for resection, the surgeon must balance the meager chances for cure (less than 1 percent) with the considerable operative hazard and the risk of lethal, costly complications. In our view, resection should be considered only for physiologically young patients with small localized lesions. These patients should be referred to surgeons specializing in pancreatic surgery who have had operative mortality rates of less than 10 percent. Pancreatic resection must, therefore, be deprived of its appeal as a procedure to which every surgeon must aspire.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of two dosage regimens of intravenous naloxone were compared to avoid nonrespiratory side effects and respiratory depression and yet to preserve analgesia (maximum tolerance to periostial pressure over the tibia) after administration of 200 micrograms epidural fentanyl. Three groups of eight patients were studied: group 1 patients received a loading dose of 0.4 mg IV naloxone followed by naloxone infusion at a rate of 10 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1. Group II patients received a loading dose of 0.2 micrograms naloxone followed by a naloxone infusion at a rate of 5 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1. Group III patients received a saline infusion at a rate of 20 ml/hr. Epidural fentanyl significantly increased tolerance to periostial pain in all three groups (respectively, +38 +/- 20%, +36 +/- 16%, and +35 +/- 14%) (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05). The naloxone infusion significantly reduced this effect in groups I and II, respectively, -40 +/- 20% and -37 +/- 28% below prenaloxone levels) (P less than 0.05). Nonrespiratory side effects were also reversed in groups I and II. In group III, neither periostial analgesia nor nonrespiratory side effects were affected. The baseline slopes of VE/PETCO2 were 2.34 +/- 1.01, 2.14 +/- 0.66, and 2.68 +/- 1.14 L.min-1.mm Hg-1, respectively, in groups I, II, and III. Epidural fentanyl significantly decreased the slope below baseline levels in each group: -21 +/- 16%, -22 +/- 17%, and -19 +/- 32%, respectively, in groups I, II and III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A major reason for quantitating the relationship of drug dose to plasma concentration is to design optimal drug administration schemes (i.e., those that can achieve desired target concentrations of a drug). Recently, the authors completed a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the new opioid alfentanil using the computer program NONMEM. This analysis quantified the effects of age, weight, and sex on disposition of alfentanil in 45 patients, and determined the average pharmacokinetic profile of the drug for the group. Using these population pharmacokinetic parameters, one can predict (estimate) the plasma concentration time course of alfentanil for any given dosage scheme. The present study evaluated the accuracy with which one could use these population data to predict plasma concentrations of alfentanil in a different group of surgical patients given iv boluses and a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil for induction and maintenance of anesthesia for abdominal and superficial surgery. A total of 597 plasma concentrations of alfentanil were measured for 19 patients. For each measured concentration, we used the population pharmacokinetic parameters obtained previously with NONMEM to calculate a predicted concentration. Accuracy and precision of the prediction were assessed by the mean bias of the prediction and by the mean absolute prediction error, respectively. The mean bias (+/- SE) (systematic over- or underprediction) was -7.9 +/- 5.2%. The mean absolute error (+/- SE), a measure of the precision, was 22.3 +/- 2.9%. Therefore, the authors' previously described population pharmacokinetic parameters for alfentanil appear to be \"robust,\" and can be used to design computerized schemes for administration of alfentanil for general surgery.\r"

Five-point MPAP/CI plots were constructed by opening an arterio-venous femoral fistula or by stepwise inflations of a balloon in the inferior vena cava. These MPAP/CI plots were rectilinear in all experimental conditions. Over the entire range of CI studied, 1-5 l.min-1.m-2, hypoxia increased MPAP in seven dogs (\"responders\"), and did not affect MPAP in six other dogs (\"nonresponders\"). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) was restored in \"nonresponders\" by administration of 1 g acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intravenously. In \"responders,\" nitrous oxide partially inhibited HPV. In \"nonresponders\" with a hypoxic pressor response restored by ASA, nitrous oxide enhanced both normoxic and hypoxic pulmonary vascular tone, and did not affect HPV. These results suggest that pulmonary vascular effects of nitrous oxide depend on preexisting pulmonary vascular tone, and may be modulated by cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism.\r"

The PR-group showed about fourfold increases in IgG antibodies in season when compared with pretreatment levels (P less than .001). IgG antibody changes from before season to season in other groups and IgE antibody changes in all three groups were not significant. Despite this, IgG antibodies in season had fallen from their peak achieved with PR. About one-third of PR-treated patients still manifested significant symptomatology irrespective of changes in IgG antibodies. We thus conclude that although changes in specific IgG may be an important correlate in PR-immunotherapy, additional mechanisms for clinical responsiveness remain to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "H1-receptor antagonists appear to be absorbed rapidly after oral administration, with peak serum concentrations being reached one to three hours after a dose. For most of these drugs, the absolute bioavailability is unknown because no intravenous formulations are available for comparative purposes. The serum elimination half-life values of these agents are variable: a few hours for terfenadine and triprolidine; about 9 hours for cetirizine, azatadine, and loratadine; from 20 to 25 hours for hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine; and from 5 to 14 days for astemizole. Few pharmacokinetic studies of H1-receptor antagonists in children have been reported. However, it is known that chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, and terfenadine have shorter elimination half-life values in children than in adults. Regardless of the age of patients, for most of the H1-receptor antagonists the apparent volumes of distribution and total body clearances appear to be large (3.4 to 18.5 L/kg and 4.4 to 32.1 mL/min/kg, respectively). Cetirizine is an exception, with values of 0.8 L/kg and 0.5 mL/min/kg. Urinary excretion of unchanged antihistamine is higher after cetirizine (60% of dose) than any other H1 blocker. For H1-receptor antagonists with long half-life values, steady state may not be reached for several days (chlorpheniramine and brompheniramine) or several weeks (astemizole), and significant accumulation of drug occurs if the dosing interval is more frequent than every half-life. There is no evidence for the introduction of metabolism of H1-receptor antagonists, even after months of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "First-generation H1-antagonist antihistamines such as hydroxyzine have a significant ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation, which limits their usefulness in the treatment of allergic disorders. Cetirizine, a carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, possesses the parent compound's antihistaminic activity but does not cause sedation. This lack of CNS effects may be due to cetirizine's greater selectivity or potency at H1 receptors in the brain, compared with its effects at the receptors involved in sedation, or it may result from the agent's relative exclusion from the CNS compartment. We compared cetirizine's activity at central H1 sites with the activity of hydroxyzine and terfenadine. We also compared the abilities of cetirizine and three other antihistamines to cross the blood-brain barrier. We found the drugs' potency at H1 receptors in the CNS to be similar to their activities in other tissues. However, their selectivity varied widely. Cetirizine, in fact, failed to bind at any of the receptors investigated except H1 sites, even at concentrations as high as 10 micron. Both hydroxyzine and D-chlorpheniramine crossed the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts. Terfenadine did so to a much lesser extent, and cetirizine passed into the CNS only half as readily as terfenadine. We suggest that cetirizine's reduced incidence of sedative side effects may stem partly from its selectivity for H1 receptors over sites involved in sedation, and partly from its relative exclusion from the CNS.\r"

Of 1,146 persons with nonsignificant reactions to Test 1, 13.8% had significant reactions on Test 2, and of 769 persons with nonsignificant reactions to Tests 1 and 2, 8.7% had significant reactions on Test 3. Males, nonwhites, and persons between 50 and 79 yr of age had a greater proportion of significant reactions for each of the first 2 tests but not for the third test. These data indicate that continued boosting of the tuberculin reaction occurs in a substantial number of persons who receive a third sequential test. Marked increases in the size of reactions caused by boosting may explain high apparent conversion rates found in facilities where the third test is delayed for one year.\r"

The effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the response to paraquat infusion were studied in awake sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas. Seven sheep were infused with paraquat (30 mg/kg) alone. Six sheep received methylprednisolone (1.0 g plus 0.5 g/h intravenously), beginning 30 min before paraquat (pretreatment), and 5 received methylprednisolone, beginning 4 h after paraquat (post-treatment). Neutrophil accumulation in the lung was measured in biopsy tissue taken at baseline and at postmortem. Methylprednisolone pretreatment significantly prevented the increase in lung lymph flow (paraquat, from 4.4 +/- 0.3 to 11.1 +/- 0.8 ml/h, p less than 0.05; pretreatment, from 4.8 +/- 0.9 to 3.7 +/- 0.3, NS), and the increase in lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (paraquat, from 0.69 +/- 0.02 to 0.80 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05; pretreatment, from 0.66 +/- 0.06 to 0.60 +/- 0.02, NS) during 8 h after paraquat infusion. Treatment with methylprednisolone after paraquat also reduced the changes in lung lymph flow and protein clearance. Methylprednisolone prior to paraquat significantly inhibited accumulation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in lymph and plasma, but did not significantly inhibit accumulation of TxB2 in lymph or plasma. The number of neutrophils in the paraquat lungs was 3 to 4 times that in the control lungs, with or without methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone pretreatment prolonged the survival time, but did not prevent death within 48 h after paraquat infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because inflammatory mediators generated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) may be important in the pathogenesis of airway hyperreactivity, the effects of theophylline upon PMN activation were studied. Theophylline (9 micrograms/ml, 50 microM) inhibited PMN leukotriene B4 generation by 50%, oxygen metabolite generation by 60%, and decreased the concentration of isoproterenol required to cause 50% maximal inhibition (EC50) from 13 to 3.3 nM. The same theophylline concentration increased PMN cAMP by 196% at 45 s after cell activation. A higher theophylline concentrations (18 micrograms/ml, 100 microM) decreased leukotriene B4 generation by more than 90%. Eight healthy volunteers were studied before and after 1 wk of oral theophylline administration (mean plasma theophylline level achieved was 9.4 micrograms/ml). Basal and 1-min postactivation cAMP concentrations were increased 160 and 157%, respectively, in PMN specimens after theophylline administration. The EC50 for isoproterenol was reduced by 50%, and the cAMP elevation induced by isoproterenol was increased by 200%. Because theophylline inhibition of PMN function appeared to be associated with both an increase in cAMP and a decrease in intracellular calcium, these effects may be relevant to both the therapeutic and adverse pharmacologic actions of theophylline. Because inflammatory mediator release was reduced by low drug concentrations, inhibition of PMN function may be an effect of therapeutic theophylline administration.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies on arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by pulmonary macrophages in vitro, we observed that the presence of serum in the culture medium influenced the profile of AA metabolites released. To further characterize this phenomenon, rat alveolar macrophages were placed in plastic tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere in the presence or absence of 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1 h. Adherent cells were then maintained in medium (equilibration) with or without FBS for 3.5 h before stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187. The release of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) (the stable metabolite of TXA2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) during culture was measured by radioimmunoassay and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, respectively, at the end of each culture step. Cell adhesion to the plastic substrate in FBS-free medium induced an intense stimulation of AA metabolism, with the release of both TXB2 and LTB4. Adhesion and the accompanying TXB2 release appear to be mediated by trypsin-sensitive components since trypsin-pretreated macrophages showed a dramatic reduction in both adherence and TXB2 synthesis. The presence of FBS during the attachment phase of culture reduced both adhesion and release of TXB2 and LTB4 by more than 50%. On the other hand, addition of FBS to cells that had completed adhesion in serum-free medium stimulated release of both metabolites. When challenged with calcium ionophore after 4.5 h of culture, macrophages that had adhered in FBS-free medium released a much smaller amount of TXB2 than did macrophages that had been cultured in the presence of FBS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mounting evidence suggests that reactive oxygen metabolites can initiate the release and metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA). We therefore examined the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a biologically relevant oxygen metabolite, on AA release and cyclooxygenase metabolism by the rat alveolar macrophage (AM). At concentrations between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M, which were largely noncytotoxic as assessed by chromium release, H2O2 exposure for 30 min caused a steep dose-dependent increase in AA release that peaked at approximately 5-fold stimulation at 10(-3) M H2O2. AA release induced by H2O2 was inhibited by the H2O2 scavenger catalase, but not by inactivated catalase or by scavengers of superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, or ferric iron. An evaluation of cyclooxygenase metabolite formation by specific radioimmunoassays and high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated a greater than 2-fold increment in thromboxane (Tx)A2 (measured as TxB2) synthesis at 10(-4) M H2O2, but no increment in prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis. H2O2-induced TxB2 synthesis was cyclooxygenase-dependent, since it was inhibited by indomethacin (1 microM). There was no significant degradation of either PGE2 or TxB2 in AM cultures by H2O2 at concentrations to 10(-2) M. The effect of H2O2 on agonist-induced cyclooxygenase metabolism was also examined. H2O2 at 10(-4) M inhibited PGE2 synthesis induced by zymosan and A23187, whereas agonist-induced TxB2 synthesis was either unaffected (zymosan) or augmented (A23187) by H2O2. These findings suggest inhibition by H2O2 of PGE2 synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normal saline and one-half strength Traumacal were infused alternately at 50 cc/hr for 24 hours and gastric pH was measured every other hour. If gastric pH dropped to 4.5 or below, patients received 30 cc of antacid via nasogastric tube. A total of 324 gastric pH determinations were made and 93 doses of antacids were administered. Average gastric pH during Traumacal infusion was 5.34 and did not significantly differ from the average pH (5.37) during saline infusion. Using multivariate analysis to control for antacids, along with diurnal and day-to-day variations, no statistically significant effect of jejunal feeding on gastric pH could be demonstrated. These results suggest that prophylaxis for stress ulceration needs to be maintained in severely injured patients fed via the jejunum.\r"

It has been adopted by several trauma centers across the country as part of their armamentarium for managing moderate to severe duodenal injuries. Most series report using a polyglycolic acid (PGA) suture in performing the exclusion, anticipating a 3- to 4-week interval before pyloric patency is re-established. A comparison of polypropylene (PP), polyglycolic acid (PGA), and polydioxanone (PDS) sutures in the dog model suggests, however, that only PDS reliably accomplishes this goal. The low (approximately 5-10%) but finite incidence of fistula formation reported with pyloric exclusion using PGA may be improved by using PDS instead.\r"

DESIGN: A survey of two cohorts of patients with AIDS who participated in nonrandomized, unblinded, non-placebo-controlled investigations of the toxicity and efficacy of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. SETTING: Clinical research unit in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive samples of 52 patients given interleukin-2 and 22 patients given interferon-gamma. Selection criteria for referred patients included a diagnosis of AIDS, hemoglobin level of greater than 100 g/L (2.0 mg/dL), creatinine level of less than 176.8 mumol/L, bilirubin level of less than 25.65 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL), the absence of active infection, and the absence of other drug therapy for 2 weeks before entry. Four patients given interleukin-2 failed to complete the study. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of natural-product or recombinant human interleukin-2, 250 to 10,000,000 U/day for 23.4 +/- 1.5 (SE) days, or recombinant human interferon-gamma, 0.001 to 1.0 mg/m2.d for 17.7 +/- 4.8 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty nonopportunistic bacterial infections occurred in 17 of 52 patients given interleukin-2, whereas non occurred in 22 patients given interferon-gamma (P less than 0.05). Bacteremia accounted for 12 of the infections. Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli accounted for 16 of the isolates. Opportunistic infections occurred in 6 patients during interleukin-2 infusion and in 1 patient during interferon-gamma infusion (P greater than 0.5). Clinical and immunologic variables and methods of management of intravenous catheters were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A marked disparity in infection with nonopportunistic bacteria, but not with opportunistic organisms, occurred in patients with AIDS who were treated with interleukin-2 as compared with those who were treated with interferon-gamma. A high incidence of bacteremia and localized bacterial infection should be anticipated in patients with AIDS who receive interleukin-2.\r"

Primary cultures of normal AP cells were continuously exposed to crude IgG from an LES patient or from healthy control subjects, and the incubation media were assayed for prolactin (PRL) or growth hormone (GH). The LES IgG caused a time- and concentration-dependent reduction of PRL and GH release compared with control IgG over 0.5 to 48 hours using concentrations of 0.01 to 4.0 mg/ml. The calcium-channel activator maitotoxin stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake and PRL release from AP cells under control conditions, and the LES IgG significantly reduced both actions of maitotoxin. Thus LES IgG appears to modulate an AP antigenic site, perhaps representing an integral component of voltage-gated calcium channels that may share properties with similar presynaptic elements at the neuromuscular junction.\r"

With optimal fixation and histochemical methods, we show the normal axonal location of tau protein in human cerebral cortex and the striking alterations of tau distribution that affect the cortical neuropil in Alzheimer's disease. Normally, cortical tau-immunoreactive fiber bundles form a pattern resembling that seen with myelin stains. The prominence of white matter staining suggests that tau may be especially enriched in projection systems. Alzheimer's disease causes massive axonal disruption and the dislocation of tau protein from its usual axonal domain into neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and presynaptic regions. The normal pattern of axonal staining in cortex is disrupted and white matter staining is reduced. Prominent abnormal tau-immunoreactive neuropil fibers are densely present even in cortical regions without classical neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque formation. The striking neuropil abnormalities, revealed by the aberrant localization of tau protein, are likely to contribute to neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

However, this significant difference is accounted for by the patients who had gastrojejunostomy with vagotomy. Vagotomy with antrectomy, antrectomy alone, and subtotal gastrectomy were not significantly different. The apparent influence of vagotomy on gastrojejunostomy may be due to a type II statistical error.

  ".W": "This study quantifies lung water in acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis to determine the degree to which pulmonary dysfunction occurs subclinically, before alterations in the arterial blood gases can be measured. Pancreatitis was induced in ten dogs by injecting 0.5 ml/kg of bile into the pancreatic ducts, which had been surgically cannulated. Pulmonary and systemic blood gases and blood pressures, heart rate, extravascular lung water, and lung blood flows were studied over 5 hours while cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were maintained at control values by Ringer's lactate infusion. The percentage of water in lung tissue was determined at the time of sacrifice using gravimetric measurements. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, reflecting intravascular volume status, did not change through at the experiment. By contrast, major disturbances were measured in the pulmonary bed with pulmonary artery pressures rising from 15.6 +/- 1.8/8.1 +/- 1.3 mmHg to 22.0 +/- 1.2/15.6 +/- 1.7 mmHg over 5 hours (p less than 0.01). Peripheral vascular resistance rose from 3.6 +/- 0.6 units to 6.6 +/- 0.4 units (p less than 0.05), whereas bronchial blood flow to the lung fell significantly. These changes in pulmonary hemodynamics were not reflected by changes in the arterial blood gases. Arterial oxygenation was maintained during 5 hours of pancreatitis. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide and the serum pH did not change significantly. There was, however, a progressive rise in extravascular lung water measured by the double-dilution technique from 10.2 +/- 0.8 ml/kg at control to 18.1 +/- 2.8 ml/kg (p less than 0.01) at 5 hours. This was confirmed by direct gravimetric measurements, which revealed an increase in the water content of the lung from 78.1 +/- 0.3% to 86.4 +/- 2.4% over the course of the experiment. Arterial blood gases, therefore, do not necessarily reflect the pulmonary deterioration in acute pancreatitis. These data supported a mechanism of lung dysfunction independent of the circulatory compromise, which often accompanies the disease in the clinical setting.\r"

Medications known to precipitate hypophosphatemia were a causative factor in 82% of the patients, with glucose administered intravenously, antacids, diuretics, and steroids being the most common agents associated with profound hypophosphatemia. Gram-negative septicemia was observed in 16 patients, and it was the second most common cause of severe hypophosphatemia. The mortality rate was 20% in patients with a serum phosphorus concentration between 0.36 and 0.48 mmol/L (1.1 and 1.5 mg/dL) (group A) and 30% in patients with a serum phosphorus concentration of less than or equal to 0.32 mmol/L (less than or equal to 1.0 mg/dL) (group B). The cause of death and its temporal association with the lowest observed values of phosphorus concentration indicate that severe hypophosphatemia might be a contributory factor to mortality. Our data indicate that severe hypophosphatemia in hospitalized patients is the result of a combination of factors. Surgery, followed by a period of fasting with intravenous administration of glucose, and gram-negative septicemia are the most common causes.\r"

In the healthy subjects, CO2 produced dose-related increases in anxiety, somatic symptoms, vital signs, and plasma cortisol levels. In the patients, the frequency of panic attacks (in eight of 14 patients) and the increases in anxiety and somatic symptoms induced by 5% CO2 exceeded those in the healthy subjects and were similar to those induced by 7.5% CO2 in the healthy subjects. The physiologic and biochemical measurements obtained did not elucidate the mechanisms underlying CO2-induced anxiety or the greater anxiogenic effects of CO2 seen in patients with panic disorders.\r"

Plasma homovanillic acid level increased significantly in patients who had poor responses to treatment but not in patients who obtained good clinical responses. Although bupropion is characterized preclinically as a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor without appreciable effects on norepinephrine (NE) reuptake, it reduced whole-body NE turnover without altering plasma NE levels at rest and following orthostatic challenge. There was a trend toward a reduction in cerebrospinal fluid 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and homovanillic acid concentrations following bupropion treatment, although these changes did not achieve statistical significance. Reduction in whole-body NE turnover has now been described for six disparate antidepressant treatments. Poor clinical outcome following treatment with bupropion may be related to perturbations in dopaminergic systems.\r"

The metabolites hydroxybupropion (HB), threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion predominated over the parent compound in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at steady state. Plasma concentrations of each metabolite correlated with cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Higher plasma metabolite concentrations were associated with poor clinical outcome. This relationship was most striking with HB; plasma HB levels were greater than 1250 ng/mL in all five nonresponders and less than 1200 ng/mL in all seven responders. Plasma HB levels correlated with postreatment plasma homovanillic acid levels. High levels of bupropion metabolites may be associated with poor clinical outcome due to toxic effects involving dopaminergic systems. Alternatively, a curvilinear dose-response relationship may exist for bupropion metabolites. Future studies should explore the clinical utility of plasma metabolite measurements in enhancing the efficacy of treatment with bupropion.\r"

Using immunohistochemical techniques, we identified two morphologically similar lymphocyte populations, which could be stained for either mu and kappa or mu and lambda. The peripheral blood contained a majority of mu/kappa-containing cells (kappa/lambda = 17.5:1), while the bone marrow only contained a modest excess of cells staining for mu/kappa (kappa/lambda = 2.4:1). The clinical significance and prognosis of biclonal IgM gammopathies is uncertain, since so few cases have been reported. Our patient has now been followed up for more than four years.\r"

Transferred patients (n = 97) had significantly higher resource utilization (ie, hospital costs) than nontransferred patients (n = 2976) within the same surgical DRGs as follows: total mean cost per patient, $17,348 vs $9,460; mean length of stay 21.4 days vs 10.9 days; mean laboratory cost per patient, $1849 vs $975; and mean radiologic cost per patient, $794 vs $397. Transferred patients generated a yearly deficit of $238,717 ($4922 loss per patient) for the hospital, whereas other patients within the same DRGs generated a profit of $727,632 ($489 profit per patient). These data support the hypothesis that DRG reimbursement will provide a financial disincentive for teaching hospitals to accept surgical transfer patients from other acute care hospitals, thus potentially decreasing the access of care for the complexly ill surgical patient.\r"

Disease was induced by a single footpad injection of purified retinal S-antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant. In those animals that did not receive B Pertussis the clinical features were those of a retinal vasculitis with disc edema, periphlebitis, and deep retinal infiltrates. In contrast, animals that received B pertussis developed lesions in the pigment epithelium and choroid. Histopathologic studies disclosed focal photoreceptor necrosis associated with mononuclear cell infiltration in both groups of animals. However, in the group that did not receive B pertussis the disease was predominantly a retinitis associated with perivascular infiltration of retinal vessels, whereas in the group that did receive B pertussis the main feature was a focal choroiditis, with superficial retinal lesions being rarely observed. Retinal photoreceptors were the target tissue in both groups of rats, but the route by which they were damaged was altered from predominantly retinal to choroidal by the addition of Bordetella pertussis as an adjuvant. This change may be ascribed to the ability of B pertussis toxin to sensitize vascular endothelium to local mast cell products, these cells being plentiful around choroidal vessels but absent in the retinal circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic alcohol consumption has long been known to interfere with reproductive function and sexual behavior, but specific effects of acute alcohol ingestion on sex hormones have been studied only recently. An attempt is made in this review to summarize and explain conflicting results from studies of the acute effects of alcohol on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, with healthy non-alcoholic men and women as subjects. In men, moderate to high doses of ethanol have been reported to suppress plasma testosterone. Although some clinical studies have not supported this observation, considerable evidence documents direct alcohol inhibition of testosterone biosynthesis in the testis. After alcohol ingestion, plasma LH remains unchanged or increases, probably because of reduced androgen negative feedback. In analogous studies with women during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, alcohol does not decrease plasma estradiol or alter LH levels. Furthermore, it has been reported that plasma levels of estradiol, progesterone and testosterone increase during alcohol treatment in the midluteal phase, while gonadotropins tend to decrease. Alcohol has no effect on LH secretion in post-menopausal women. Because reports on the acute effects of alcohol in men have not been consistent, it remains to be determined if acute alcohol effects in men and women are really different. In men, provocative tests of gonadotropin response to LHRH stimulation were normal during periods of intoxication and hangover, indicating that ethanol has no significant direct effect on LH secretion at the pituitary level. It seems more likely that alcohol changes plasma levels of sex steroids by altering hepatic, gonadal, and possibly adrenal metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similar signs, but much more short-lived, can also be precipitated by injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, RO-15-788.\r"

We found a 22-36% reduction in the levels of the (Na + K)ATPase, Ca++ATPase, acetylcholinesterase and 5'-nucleotidase from PAE rats. This reduction was greater in PPAE animals. The transition temperature in Arrhenius plots of the synaptosomal (Na + K)ATPase activity from PPAE rats was lower than in control rat membranes, indicating an alteration of lipid-protein interactions. No change in transition temperature was noted in PAE animals. Also, there was a decreased cholesterol content in PPAE synaptic membranes, vs. controls, while there was no change in PAE membranes. Kinetic parameters of the synaptosomal (Na + K)ATPase from PPAE rats, revealed a decrease in the Km and Vmax for potassium. These findings indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure probably delays synaptic development, whereas continued alcohol exposure during lactation may, in addition, alter the physicochemical structure of synaptic membranes.\r"

After fasting over night the subjects received ethanol (1.0 g/kg of body weight) during 1.5 hours in the morning. Thereafter 100 micrograms of GHRH were given intravenously and the blood or serum concentrations of ethanol, glucose, GH, sometomedin C, free fatty acids and acetate were monitored for 4 hours. Every subject served as his own control by participating in an identical session during which water was served instead of ethanol. In 6 out of 9 subjects ethanol augmented the response of GH secretion to GHRH. Interestingly, serum concentrations of somatomedin C were higher after ethanol intake than without ethanol. Ethanol had no effect on blood glucose but serum concentrations of free fatty acids were lower and those of acetate higher during the ethanol session than in the control experiment. The results favour the suggestion that ethanol does not inhibit the GH release at the hypohyseal level. In contrast, ethanol may enhance the effect of GHRH, possibly through its influence upon serum levels of free fatty acids.\r"

In these experiments, the effect of ethanol in vitro on human gel-filtered platelets activated with A23187 or with collagen was studied at different levels of mechanical stimulus (stirring rate) in the platelet aggregometer. The dose response curve obtained by varying the concentration of aggregating agent at constant stirring rate was shifted to the right in the parallel fashion by ethanol. A23187-induced aggregation was inhibited to a greater extent than that due to collagen. When a stirring rate: response curve for platelet aggregation was obtained at a constant concentration of either chemical aggregating agent ethanol shifted the curve to the right in a non-parallel fashion, its effect being greater at greater levels of mechanical stimulus. The effects of acetylsalicylic acid, known to act at a step subsequent to PLA2 activation, were completely unlike those of ethanol. The results are consistent with an inhibitory effect of ethanol on activation of phospholipase A2 by mechanical stimuli which deform platelet membranes.\r"

The covalent binding of acetaldehyde to lysine-dependent enzymes selectively inhibited their catalytic activity. Acetaldehyde adduct formation with tubulin also decreased its ability to assemble into microtubules. In addition, certain lysine residues in the alpha-chain of the tubulin dimer had a selective and enhanced reactivity toward acetaldehyde. This selectivity of binding to the alpha-chain occurred for stable adducts but not unstable adducts, and impaired tubulin assembly correlated with stable adduct formation. These studies indicate that acetaldehyde may preferentially bind to certain key lysine amino groups in proteins, and the resultant binding can cause marked alterations in biological function.\r"

Incubation of the cells with [3H]-arachidonic acid resulted in labeling of most phospholipids and triacylglycerols, although individual phospholipids exhibited different rates for acquiring the label. Labeled arachidonate was first incorporated into phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylinositols prior to equilibriation with other phospholipids. In short term incubation (8 hr), ethanol (128-255 mM) enhanced the incorporation of labeled arachidonate into most phospholipids. In addition, ethanol at 128 mM enhanced the labeling of the triacylglycerols, and the difference was greater with increasing time of ethanol exposure. It is concluded that ethanol enhanced the uptake and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into the cell membrane lipids. This study further indicates the feasibility of using the RBA-1 cells in culture to probe the effects of ethanol on membrane lipid metabolism.\r"

In the present study we tested this hypothesis on ultrasonic distress crying in neonatal rats separated from mother and litter-mates. The results showed that both ethanol and diazepam reduced crying in a dose-dependent manner and at doses not affecting the level of motor activity. It was found that the effects of diazepam, but not that of ethanol, was antagonized by the specific benzodiazepine-receptor-antagonist Ro 15-1788. The effects of ethanol were antagonized by the GABA-ergic antagonist picrotoxin. Assessing the sedative/ataxic effects of ethanol and diazepam by the surface body righting response, it was found that the effect of diazepam, but not of ethanol, was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. The results support the hypothesis that ethanol exerts similar anxiolytic actions as diazepam, but that the effects are mediated by different mechanisms.\r"

In five men not progressing beyond persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and two progressing to AIDS, HIV-Ag was detected once in 'free' configuration before HIV-Ab seroconversion and persistently or intermittently 'complexed' thereafter; in six of these men HIV core antibodies were continuously present with a declining level in one. In two men not progressing beyond PGL and five progressing to AIDS HIV-Ag was detected 'complexed' before HIV-Ab seroconversion once and persisted predominantly in 'free' configuration thereafter, while no HIV core antibody was detected in six of these men and a declining level in one. HIV-Ag was detected in 37% (14 out of 38) of HIV core antibody seropositive samples, mostly in 'complexed' form, while HIV-Ag was detected in 86% (43 out of 50) of HIV core antibody seronegative samples, mostly in both 'complexed' and 'free' configuration. Antibodies to HIV envelope antigen were detected in all HIV-Ab seropositive samples. These results indicate that the level of HIV-Ag expression is the primary determinant of detectability of HIV core antigens as well as antibodies. Enhancement of HIV-Ag expression, in a significant number of cases associated with clinical deterioration, appears to lead to clearance of HIV core antibodies in immune complexes, while HIV envelope antibody levels remain relatively unaffected.\r"

In vitro studies have shown that PFA is also an effective inhibitor of HIV (HTLV III/LAV) at doses readily attainable in vitro. A pilot study was therefore performed with a 3-week intravenous infusion of PFA in 11 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). Viral isolations were performed before and at regular intervals up to 3 months post-infusion on treated patients, as well as on four untreated control patients. Virus isolation was negative after therapy in eight patients, six of whom were negative throughout the follow-up period. Virus was isolated on 70% of attempts from the four control subjects and on 20% of attempts from treated subjects. Three patients showed an improvement in delayed hypersensitivity responses. No obvious improvement was seen in patients' OKT4 positive lymphocyte counts. Treatment was not limited by side-effects with the exception of one patient who developed an axillary vein thrombosis within 4 days of treatment via a subclavian line. Treatment was therefore discontinued following administration of only one dose and the patient was excluded from further study. A further patient had reversible renal dysfunction. Other side-effects were minor, consisting of headache or thrombophlebitis at the site of infusion. These results suggest that a further trial with PFA administered over a longer period and with a longer follow-up period in AIDS and ARC patients may be warranted, particularly if an oral preparation becomes available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Foscarnet was administered by continuous intravenous infusion in 15 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in an open, uncontrolled study. Mean steady state serum concentrations of foscarnet was 261 mumol/l. Treatment was given for 6-21 days, median 14 days, being interrupted prematurely due to renal function impairment in seven patients, and due to other reasons in three patients. Foscarnet therapy was accompanied by improvement of some, probably cytomegalovirus (CMV) related, symptoms but did not otherwise affect the clinical condition of the patients. The occurrence of positive CMV cultures decreased significantly during therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection by culture was positive in 70-80% of cultures and was unaffected by foscarnet treatment. Eight patients had detectable, free HIV antigen in serum before therapy, and in five of these HIV antigen disappeared during therapy, but reappeared 4-23 weeks after therapy. No patient lost HIV antigen, except during foscarnet therapy. No patient became HIV antigen positive during foscarnet therapy. Immunological parameters did not change during or after foscarnet therapy. Renal function impairment was seen in 9 patients (95% confidence limits, 32-84%), apparently due to reversible tubular damage. At follow-up, serum creatine was normal in all surviving patients. Concomitant medication may have contributed to the renal side-effects. Severe renal function impairment, i.e. serum creatinine above 0.25 mumol/l, was only seen in patients who at the start of foscarnet therapy were chronically affected by their disease. Thus, foscarnet reduces HIV antigen production in AIDS patients. Renal function impairment limits foscarnet use in AIDS patients, but in individuals with less severe manifestations of HIV infection, this side effect may be less frequent.\r"

Twenty-two people were retrospectively found to have seroconverted to HIV during the interval. Each seroconverter was matched to two seronegative and two seropositive controls. Matched case-control analyses using the seronegative controls determined that the following symptoms lasting for 3 or more days were associated with new HIV infection: fever greater than 37.7 degrees C, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats and headaches. Matched case-control analyses using the seropositive controls determined that the following symptoms lasting for 3 or more days were associated with new HIV infection: fatigue, fever greater than 37.7 degrees C, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats and headaches. It was notable that the majority of seroconversions were not associated with any symptoms lasting for 3 or more days. Due to their non-specificity, symptoms associated with seroconversion are not likely to have a high positive predictive value. In high risk populations, however, appearance of these symptoms may facilitate identification of early infection that may be important for studies of natural history or for optimal timing for initiating antiviral therapy.\r"

Logistic regression analysis identified significant relative risks for HIV infection associated with the frequency of drug injection and the proportion of injections in 'shooting galleries'. Additional risk among men was associated with a history of homosexual relations. Traditional efforts taken by subjects to clean syringes between uses, such as washing with water or alcohol, showed no evidence of being protective. Programmes aimed at prevention of HIV infection should focus on reducing use of shooting galleries and sharing of needles and syringes as well as reducing intravenous drug abuse generally.\r"

Our data clearly demonstrated that for early analysis of HIV infection only the detection of IgM antibodies to viral protein bands of the Western blot technique provides reliable results and that scanning and advanced integration analysis of the Western blot peaks offer the advantage of direct quantitative comparison of the results, not just qualitative description. Further, this direct quantitative comparison of antibodies to HIV virus protein bands can be used as a prognostic marker for disease states.\r"

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, colonoscopy, biopsy, stool parasitology and culture were performed. Endoscopy revealed oral and/or oesophageal candidiasis in 22 patients. Stool examination and histology of the upper GI tract showed that 11 patients had cryptosporidiosis and three had isosporiasis (total of 61% of patients with coccidian enteritis). One case of possible Mycobacterium avium mycobacteriosis was also identified. Enteropathic AIDS in Uganda presents with a spectrum of infections similar to that found in developed countries, but the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and isosporiasis is higher.\r"

  ".U": "88107295\r", 
  ".W": "Ventilatory effects of propofol, used as a sole agent for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, were studied in 14 healthy unpremedicated patients. Subarachnoid anaesthesia was established before induction of general anaesthesia. Induction was with propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 given while the patients breathed 100% oxygen. We intended to start an infusion of propofol 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1; maintain it for at least 25 min; make a first set of quasi-steady-state observations; double the infusion; and repeat observations after 25 min. The single induction bolus plus single rate infusion was not totally satisfactory: further boluses were usually needed. At induction there was apnoea in all but three patients, sometimes lasting more than 3 min; hyperventilation before induction, combined with hyperoxia, probably exaggerated this. Established ventilatory rates were generally 30% higher than awake. One patient became bradypnoeic. Tidal volume and minute ventilation, and the Tl:Ttot ratio, were reduced. Doubling the infusion rate had no clear effect on frequency or tidal volume, but it further reduced the Tl:Ttot ratio and caused an increase in PE'CO2 of 1 kPa. The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was 58% of baseline awake control (95% confidence limits +/- 26%) at the lower infusion rate, with further slight depression when the infusion rate was doubled. Doubling the rate of infusion of propofol did not give twice the effect on ventilation, and probably is not giving twice the \"depth\" of anaesthesia. We cannot say if this is for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons.\r"

In conscious responses, breath-by-breath minute ventilation (VI) generally correlated better with end-tidal carbon dioxide than did tidal volume (VT), but VT correlated better than VI in the anaesthetized responses. The source of this difference was that, whereas VT and the inspiratory period were both smaller and less variable when subjects were anaesthetized rather than conscious, the expiratory period was no less variable, and this disturbed the usual inverse relation between VT and the duration of the ventilatory cycle. Anaesthesia stabilized the switch from inspiration to expiration, but not that from expiration to inspiration. In some patients, it produced a disturbance pronounced enough to suggest bimodality of the timing of expiration.\r"

Tidal volume (VT), minute volume (VE), maximal inspired (PICO2) and end-tidal (PE'CO2) carbon dioxide tensions and airway pressure were measured. VE, set to produce a PE'CO2 of about 4.5 kPa and measured at a high FGF (minimal rebreathing), was unchanged throughout the study and the regression equation for VE and weight was: VE (ml min-1) = 146 x kg + 482, r = 0.92. Measurements were then repeated at FGF:VE ratios reduced to 1.5 and 1.0. To achieve minimal rebreathing (PICO2 less than 0.5 kPa), FGF:VE ratios greater than 1.8 (range 1.8-4.9) had to be used. At FGF:VE ratios of 1.5, some alveolar rebreathing occurred, indicated by increased inspired (P less than 0.001) and end-tidal (P less than 0.001) carbon dioxide tensions. At FGF:VE ratios equal to 1.0, alveolar rebreathing was more pronounced and hypercapnoea occurred with a PE'CO2 (mean +/- 1 SD) of 5.89 +/- 0.53 kPa. At this FGF setting, change in I:E ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 did not influence the level of alveolar rebreathing. A minimal FGF (ml min-1) setting of 1.5 x VE (that is, 1.5 (146 x kg + 482), approximated to the expression (200 x kg + 1000) is recommended for controlled ventilation to avoid hypercapnoea when using the T-piece system in children weighing less than 20 kg.\r"

Experiments were performed on 15 male Wistar rats with chronically implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. The threshold for pain induced by brief passage of electric current between pairs of electrodes placed on the tail and the skin of the neck was measured before and after subarachnoid injections of midazolam. Intrathecal midazolam caused a significant (P less than 0.02) increase in the threshold for pain in the tail, but not in the neck; this response was not produced by intrathecal injections of vehicle and was blocked by prior intraperitoneal injections of the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788. We also performed experiments on frog sciatic nerves which showed that midazolam did not have a local anaesthetic action. We conclude that intrathecal midazolam causes spinally-mediated analgesia by binding to benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "The retention equations upon which the Multiple Inert Gas Method is based are derived from basic principles using elementary algebra. It is shown that widely disparate distributions produce indistinguishable sets of retentions. The limits of resolution of perfused compartments in the VA/Q distribution obtainable by the use of the multiple inert gas method are explored mathematically, and determined to be at most shunt and two alveolar compartments (\"tripartite\" distribution). Every continuous distribution studied produced retentions indistinguishable from those of its unique \"matching\" tripartite distribution. When a distribution is minimally specified, it is unique. Any additional specification (increased resolution--more compartments) of the distribution results in the existence of an infinitude of possible distributions characterized by indistinguishable sets of retention values. No further increase in resolution results from the use of more tracers. When sets of retention values were extracted from published multiple inert gas method continuous distributions, and compared with the published \"measured\" retention sets, substantial differences were found. This illustrates the potential errors incurred in the practical, in vivo application of the multiple inert gas method. In preliminary studies, the tripartite distribution could be determined with at least comparable accuracy by blood-gas (oxygen, carbon dioxide) measurements.\r"

Arterial blood-gas tensions have higher resolution than inert gas retentions in terms of distinguishing a single VA/Q compartment from a progressively broadening lognormal distribution. The maximum number of compartments determinable by arterial blood-gas tensions is three; VA/Q distributions containing more compartments are non-unique. Without utilizing 100% inspired oxygen, arterial blood-gas tensions cannot resolve the relative perfusion in shunt and low-VA/Q compartments, but the total perfusion in these compartments is determinable. The way in which the arterial blood-gas tensions vary with the variables of two and three-compartment distributions is described. Two- and three-compartment VA/Q distributions are derivable from either arterial blood-gas tensions or inert gas retentions.\r"

They then received no further ventilation, 10 breaths, or 20 breaths of hyperventilation with 100% oxygen from a non-rebreathing system with a high fresh gas flow. Transcutaneous oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SaO2) was monitored continuously and E'CO2 was measured before and after the seizure. Observation of an isolated forearm was used to time the seizure duration. SaO2 remained greater than 90% in all patients. Passive hyperventilation with 20 breaths significantly reduced E'CO2 and prolonged seizure duration. E'CO2 before the seizure and change in E'CO2 during the seizure did not correlate significantly with seizure duration.\r"

Ventilation of the lobe with 7% oxygen in nitrogen resulted in a 37% reduction in Ql/Qt at the beginning and end of the main procedure, thus confirming that the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response was unchanged throughout the study. The effects of varying mean airway pressure to the right lung by changing inspiratory:expiratory time ratio and by the addition of a positive end-expiratory pressure were studied when the left lower lobe was insufflated with oxygen or 7% oxygen in nitrogen, or was collapsed. Insufflation of the lobe with 7% oxygen in nitrogen and collapse reduced Ql/Qt by 61% and 66%, respectively. However, changing mean airway pressure in the right lung produced no significant changes in Ql/Qt in any of the different lobar conditions or when collapse was produced after fluid loading. Fluid loading during collapse increased cardiac output and pulmonary vascular pressures and increased Ql/Qt to a value which was not significantly different from lobar ventilation with 7% oxygen in nitrogen. It is concluded that moderate increases in mean airway pressure do not increase Ql/Qt when this has been reduced by exposure of the lobe to mixed venous blood-gas tensions.\r"

The cells were obtained after delivery from four groups of women: following spontaneous labour at term (38-42 weeks gestation), at elective caesarean section at term before the onset of labour, after induced labour at term, and after uncomplicated preterm (27-36 weeks) labour. Chorionic cells had a high progesterone output with relatively low cortisol and PGE production, whereas decidual cells had a high cortisol and PGE production rate. Free arachidonic acid stimulated PGE production in both decidual and chorionic cells. There were no significant differences in either steroid or PGE production among the four groups studied. These data suggest that steroid dehydrogenase activity in choriodecidual cells is not related to the mode of onset of labour and that the increased prostaglandin production in intrauterine tissues associated with parturition is due to enhanced availability of arachidonic acid.\r"

Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) was administered when oestradiol levels were less than or equal to 1700 pg/ml and the leading follicles between 17 and 22 mm in diameter. During the withholding period follicular growth continued in all patients, while oestradiol levels declined in all but three. These three patients conceived. Ovulation was observed in six additional women. Ovarian hyperstimulation did not occur in any of the 12 patients. We conclude that a rescue of 'overstimulated cycles' is sometimes possible. Conception seems to depend on a continuing rise of E2 levels and early detection of 'overstimulation'.\r"

With 1.25 mg/day, oestradiol concentrations reached levels similar to those achieved during the control follicular phase, with a concomitant decrease in FSH secretion.

We suggest that in this patient the leukemic T cells arose from one of the rare T cells bearing a gamma-delta rather than an alpha-beta TCR heterodimeric molecule. In the other patient several discrete TRG gamma rearrangements were detected. Because her leukemic cells were shown to be monoclonal on the grounds of their karyotype, we suggest that her leukemia originated before any rearrangement had taken place.

  ".W": "In T cell malignancy, rearrangements of chromosome 14 have been observed with a break in the band that contains the alpha chain gene for the T cell receptor (TCR). Because the beta chain TCR gene is in chromosome band 7q34, we searched for and report finding specific rearrangements of 7q34 exclusively in T cell malignancies. The rearrangements were reciprocal translocations between 7q34 and other points: 1p34, 9q32, 9q34, 15q22, and 19p13. The malignancies containing a 7q34 translocation were either T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias or T cell lymphoblastic lymphomas that had similarities in clinical, enzyme, immunologic, and cellular characteristics. Hybridization using a probe to the beta-TCR gene disclosed unique rearrangements consistent with clonality in every case. A common pattern with chromosome breakpoints involving TCR genes may be emerging in T cell neoplasia.\r"

  ".U": "88108160\r", 
  ".W": "The plasmid pUC18 contains a lacZ alpha-complementation gene that codes for a small peptide that can complement the delta M15 mutation of the Escherichia coli lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene, converting bacteria carrying that mutated gene from the lacZ- to the lacZ+ phenotype. This plasmid was used in experiments designed to study mutagenesis by human neutrophils. E coli carrying pUC18 were incubated with neutrophils under conditions in which little ingestion of the bacteria took place; the plasmid was then isolated and transformed into an E coli strain (BOZO) that carries the lacZ delta M15 mutation. Of these transformants, 11 of 205,000 were lacZ, suggesting that in these 11, alpha-complementation had been lost through a mutation. No lac- colonies were detected among several hundred thousand BOZO transformed with plasmid isolated from incubations in which phagocytosis could take place, nor from incubations from which neutrophils were omitted. Despite the lac- phenotype of these 11 transformants, plasmids reisolated from nine of them showed normal alpha-complementing ability when transformed into fresh BOZO. These findings indicated that in these nine, the mutations were located in the chromosomes of the transformed BOZO. It thus appears that on exposure to activated neutrophils, a plasmid may acquire a lesion (? mutation) that can somehow be transferred to the genome of a recipient microorganism, resulting in repair of the damaged plasmid accompanied by mutation of the recipient's chromosome. Restriction mapping of the DNA from four of these nine chromosomal mutants suggested that the mutations did not represent major insertions or deletions in the portion of the bacterial chromosome corresponding to the pUC18 lac operon insert, nor in the remainder of the lacZ delta M15 gene. These results confirm previous work showing that exposure to activated neutrophils can induce mutations in biological systems, and provides an experimental model in which the mechanism of neutrophil-mediated mutagenesis may be examined.\r"

Since IL-2 can act directly on unstimulated T-cells to induce IFN-gamma production we have now examined the effect of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) on purified resting T lymphocytes from RA patients. Treatment with rIL-2(25 U/ml) of lymphocytes from 15 controls led to an increased production of 72-h supernatant EBV-inhibitory activity (19 +/- 4% SE without; 48 +/- 7% with rIL-2), but had only minimal or no effect on gamma-interferon production by E-rosetting lymphocytes from 15 patients with active RA. This defect could not be corrected by adding indomethacin to RA cultures.\r"

Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.\r"

The drug is formulated as a 3.6 mg depot dispersed in a matrix of d,l-lactide-glycolide copolymer, which is totally biodegradable. This formula releases drug continuously for at least 28 days and reliably suppresses serum testosterone into the castrate range. The effect of the depot was studied in 29 patients with locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Average age at entry was 71 years (range 52-87) and follow-up was from 13.5 to 34.5 months (median 23). Endocrine studies showed that medical castration was maintained in all cases. Three patients experienced bone pain in the first month of treatment and two others had temporary nephrostomies for worsening ureteric obstruction. Subjective improvement was seen in 23/28 cases (82%). There were no complete responses, but partial response was seen in 24/28 (85.7%) using our own criteria, 24/28 (85.7%) using the criteria recommended by the British Prostate Group (BPG) and 15/28 (53.6%) using NPCP criteria. Stable disease was seen in 3/28 patients (10.7%) by our own or BPG criteria, and in 12/28 patients (42.9%) according to NPCP criteria. Progression of disease was measurable in 21 patients (72.4%) whatever criteria were applied; 11/29 (37.9%) have died, giving a median survival of 10 months (range 2.4-26). Following these encouraging results, a multicentre randomised comparative study with stilboestrol 3 mg daily is being undertaken.\r"

As well as the usual clinical and radiological assessments of extent of disease, we used an immunoradiometric assay of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (Hybritech Europe) and normal laboratory enzymatic assays of acid phosphatase (AP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) for biochemical assessment. The upper limit of normal for PSA was taken as 10 micrograms/l. The range of PSA was wide and differed significantly from that of AP and to a lesser extent ALKP in metastatic cases. PSA outperformed both AP and ALKP in both the local and advanced groups in terms of sensitivity. There was no correlation, however, between histological grade and level of PSA, AP or ALKP (the latter in cases with bone disease). In patients with metastatic disease diagnosed by bone scan, nine patients had one abnormal site/one \"hot spot\", and all of these had a PSA greater than twice the normal upper limit. Early death due to prostate cancer was noted in four patients with levels of PSA greater than 2500 micrograms/l. PSA is more sensitive than either enzymatic AP or ALKP in both locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer and is useful in identifying those advanced cases who have single lesions on bone scan. In this series PSA gave an overall sensitivity of 89%, compared with 63% for AP and 64% for ALKP in patients with metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The main iron chelator used for transfusional iron overload is desferrioxamine, which is expensive, has toxic side effects, and has to be given subcutaneously. An orally active iron chelator is therefore required. The effects of oral 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one on urinary iron excretion were studied in eight patients who had received multiple transfusions: four had myelodysplasia and four beta thalassaemia major. Different daily doses of the drug up to 100 mg/kg/day, alone or in combination with ascorbic acid, were used. In three patients with thalassaemia the effect of the drug was compared with that of subcutaneous desferrioxamine at the same daily dose. In all eight patients a single dose of oral 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one resulted in substantial urinary iron excretion, mainly in the first 12 hours. Urinary iron excretion increased with the dose and with the degree of iron loading of the patient. Giving two or three divided doses over 24 hours resulted in higher urinary iron excretion than a single dose of the same amount over the same time. In most patients coadministration of oral ascorbic acid further increased urinary iron excretion. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one caused similar iron excretion to that achieved with subcutaneous desferrioxamine at a comparable dose. In some cases the iron excretion was sufficiently high (maximum 99 mg/day) to suggest that a negative iron balance could be easily achieved with these protocols in patients receiving regular transfusions. No evidence of toxicity was observed on thorough clinical examination or haematological and biochemical testing in any of the patients. None of the patients had any symptoms that could be ascribed to the drug. These results suggest that the oral chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one is as effective as subcutaneous desferrioxamine in increasing urinary iron excretion in patients loaded with iron. Its cheap synthesis, oral activity, and lack of obvious toxicity at effective doses suggest that it should be developed quickly and thoroughly tested for the management of transfusional iron overload.\r"

After tobacco smoking had been controlled for men who smoked non-tobacco cigarettes showed significant decreases in expiratory flow rates at low lung volumes and in the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second to the vital capacity. This effect on pulmonary function in male non-tobacco cigarette smokers was greater than the effect of tobacco cigarette smoking. These data suggest that non-tobacco cigarette smoking may be an important risk factor in young adults with respiratory symptoms or evidence of airways obstruction.\r"

A mean (median) time of two (one) days elapsed before arrival when summaries were delivered by hand and a mean (median) of four and a half (four) days when they were posted; at least 55% of summaries delivered by hand arrived within one day of the day of discharge compared with 8% of those posted. If all interim discharge summaries were given to patients to deliver communication between hospitals and general practitioners would be accelerated and considerable savings might be made.\r"

Statistics were collected from the 13 hospitals that admit acute psychiatric patients in the Greater Manchester area, and the figures for 1980-1 were compared with those for 1984-5. Changes in use of the different sections were examined in university units, large psychiatric hospitals, and district general hospital units. The use of emergency orders decreased and the use of treatment orders increased; the use of observation orders remained unchanged. Many more patients exercised their right of appeal in 1984-5, but the number discharged by tribunals remained small. The nurses' holding power was used infrequently. The different types of hospital are now more concordant in their use of these orders than before the 1983 act.\r"

Sixteen actions concerned minor problems that are an unavoidable risk of treatment, and 39 were due to natural causes. In other cases it was debatable whether a medical accident or negligence was responsible. At the end of three years 73 actions had been withdrawn, 12 settled out of court, and one lost in court by the plaintiff, and 14 were pending. Of these 14, nine were likely to reach court on charges of negligence. Contributory causes were failure of communication in 27 and matters connected with the patient's attitude or personality in 20. Because much time and money are spent on cases that should never have started a doctor should sit on the legal aid panel to give advice for medical cases. Also, solicitors should obtain an independent medical opinion when a complaint is first received from a patient. Consent forms should be more informative and give details of what can reasonably be expected from treatment and its possible risks.\r"

  ".W": "In 1985, as part of a national random household omnibus survey by a market research company, 30,976 Australians (mostly of European origin) were asked whether they had ever been treated by a doctor for skin cancer. The treating doctor or hospital was then approached for confirmation of the diagnosis of all those people who claimed to have been so treated within the past 12 months. Demographic data were also collected, permitting analysis by age, sex, country of birth, current residence, and skin reaction to strong sunlight. Melanomas accounted for less than 5% of the tumours treated. The world standardised incidence of melanoma was 19/100,000 population. The standardised incidence of treated non-melanocytic skin cancer in Australia was estimated to be 823/100,000. The standardised rates for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were 657 and 166/100,000 respectively, yielding a standardised rate ratio of about 4:1. Standardised rates based on medically confirmed cases only were 555, 443, and 112/100,000 for all non-melanocytic skin cancers, basal cell carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas respectively. Significant differences and trends in incidence were noted with respect to age and sex. Rates in men were higher than those in women but significantly so only after the age of 60. People born in Australia had a rate of 936/100,000 compared with 402/100,000 in British migrants. Rates for non-melanocytic skin cancer showed a gradient with respect to latitude within Australia. The rate in people residing north of 29 degrees S was 1242/100,000 compared with a rate of 489/100,000 in those living south of 37 degrees S. A person's skin reaction to strong sunlight was a good indicator of the risk of skin cancer, tanning ability being inversely related to its incidence. The rate in those who always burnt and never tanned when exposed to strong sunlight was 1764/100,000 compared with a rate of 616/100,000 in those who always tanned and never burnt. These findings have important implications for public education programmes in relation to exposure to sunlight in Australia.\r"

  ".W": "To see whether general practitioners could effectively carry out training in relaxation and management of stress to reduce mild hypertension a study was carried out with a subsample of phase 2 of the Medical Research Council's treatment of mild hypertension trial. In the main mild hypertension trial patients had been receiving either an active drug or placebo for six years. In phase 2 a subsample of these patients were randomly allocated either to continue or to stop receiving the active drug or placebo. In a further subsample patients were again randomised to receive or not to receive relaxation therapy. This factorial design presented an additional opportunity to assess whether patients controlled with active drugs might have their blood pressure maintained by this behavioural therapy once drug treatment was stopped and to assess whether blood pressure might be further reduced by this therapy in patients who had been under regular medical supervision for as long as six years and who had already received non-pharmacological advice. The therapy was conducted by general practitioners in group sessions once a week for eight weeks. The training in relaxation was accompanied by galvanic skin resistance biofeedback. At one year follow up blood pressure in the relaxation subgroups was either maintained (in the group who had stopped receiving drugs) or reduced further (in the group who had continued receiving drugs and in both placebo groups), while in the control group it had increased in all the subgroups, but particularly in those who had stopped receiving drugs. Differences in changes in blood pressure between the relaxation and control groups were significant. There were five new cardiovascular events, including evidence of myocardial ischaemia in blindly coded electrocardiograms in the control group, compared with one in the treatment group. General practitioners, if motivated, can successfully apply this technique of training those with mild hypertension in relaxation and management of stress.\r"
