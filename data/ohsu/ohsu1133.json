Features that help distinguish erysipelas are acute onset, erythema, warmth, edema, pain, fever, and isolated regional involvement with clearly demarcated margins. High ASO titers and response to penicillin therapy are reassuring. Simple uncomplicated erysipelas or cellulitis in adults can usually be treated on an outpatient basis. Extensive facial involvement with fever and a toxic appearance warrants hospitalization. Facial cellulitis or erysipelas in children, unless quite limited, requires hospitalization because of the high risk of Hemophilus influenzae infection and sepsis. Hospitalized patients should show visible signs of resolution and be afebrile for at least 24 hours prior to discharge. They should be maintained on oral antibiotic therapy at home for an additional 7 to 10 days.\r"

However, large data bases designed for other purposes, such as hospital discharge abstract systems and medical claims systems, are the primary source of data for AIDS research. Thus, methodologies must be developed that enable researchers to investigate AIDS using data bases designed for other purposes. In this report, we describe a methodology for utilizing Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) data to conduct health services research on AIDS. We developed an ICD-9-CM diagnosis-based algorithm that accurately identified the majority of AIDS cases, both before and after AIDS-specific ICD-9-CM codes became available in October 1986. Using diagnostic categories that we had developed previously to identify AIDS cases among disabled young men in California on Medicaid, we expanded the methodology to include children, men, and women of all ages in California and New York. The algorithm worked best with young disabled males, older males, and females between 18 and 50 years of age. The algorithm worked least well with nondisabled males, females over age 50 years, and children. We also developed methodologies for defining Medicaid AIDS onset, risk group, and date of death. Our research resulted in the identification of a study population representing the majority of Medicaid AIDS cases between 1983 and 1986 in California and New York. The AIDS study population data base was used in further research on eligibility patterns, the epidemiology of the AIDS epidemic, lifetime Medicaid utilization and expenditures, and the development of a survival-based severity index for Medicaid recipients with AIDS.\r"

The epidemic affected the New York and California Medicaid programs in several similar ways. The total number of cases grew rapidly over the study time period. In both states, the epidemic was mostly confined to the young adult (21-44 years) age group. Cases were geographically concentrated and highly localized even within counties, but evidence of geographic dispersion to counties outside of the urban centers was also evident. Some dramatic differences were also found between California and New York. Patients with claims histories of drug use were far more likely to be found in the New York population and the proportion of other adult males (our proxy for the homosexual risk group) was higher in California. A much higher proportion of New York's population was female (30 vs. 5%). New York also had many more pediatric cases. Most importantly, New York's raw number of cases was substantially higher than California, with approximately three times as many cases during the time period (1983-1986). There is also substantial evidence that transmission of the disease to heterosexual partners of drug users places heterosexual urban minorities at grave risk of contracting the disease through interaction with infected persons.\r"

The study analyzed what eligibility groups or categories and which financial standards PWAs were using to qualify for Medicaid. States have many options with regard to the categories of people they cover under Medicaid and where they set their financial thresholds. The study findings are useful in showing how these policy decisions affect PWAs. A major conclusion of the study is the importance of medically needy coverage for PWAs. Medically needy coverage, which is optional to states, opens up Medicaid to persons of any income level, assuming their medical expenses are high enough. The study also found that PWAs who qualify only through the medically needy provisions have much shorter enrollment and lower lifetime Medicaid expenditures than other PWAs on Medicaid. Presumably, most medically needy only enrollees have other sources of health care coverage in the early stages of the illness. Study data also suggested significant administrative obstacles for PWAs in dealing with the Medicaid eligibility process. Finally, an unexpected study result was that all states may not be aggressively utilizing federal Medicaid financing options for covering the medical assistance expenditures for a significant proportion of the low-income AIDS population.\r"

To address the shortage of information in these areas, this study examined average Medicaid expenditures and service use for the time period a person has AIDS. The study population was Medicaid enrollees with AIDS in New York and California who died between October 1985 and September 1986. The study focused on the differences between the two states and between four groups that were proxies for at-risk populations: children, women, drug-using men, and non-drug-using men. Mean lifetime Medicaid expenditures were about $30,000 in New York and $20,000 in California. Inpatient use was higher and outpatient service use was lower in New York than in California after controlling for risk group, diagnosis, and Medicaid eligibility group (a proxy for income level). In California, women had higher expenditures and inpatient use than men. In New York, women and drug-using men had higher expenditures and use of inpatient and outpatient services (except home health care) than the non-drug-using men. Children in New York had higher expenditures and hospital use than adults but similar outpatient service use. Multivariate analyses suggest that differences between risk groups were largely attributable to differences in diagnosis and income level (as measured by Medicaid eligibility group).\r"

The resulting conceptual model included 19 AIDS-defining conditions and 80 subsequent AIDS-related complications. This model was tested on longitudinal disease histories of 3,937 AIDS patients in the New York State Medicaid Program diagnosed between 1983 and 1986 and followed through 1988. The initial AIDS diagnosis and complications within 3 months of AIDS onset were identified from coded diagnoses recorded on inpatient and outpatient claims. Three AIDS-defining diagnosis groups were created; survival times from least to most severe group were 25, 10, and 7 months. To determine the influence of subsequent complications on risk of death, the survival times associated with combinations of defining diagnosis groups and four severity levels of subsequent complications were determined. Median survival ranged from 43 months for the least severe defining diagnosis group without early complications to 12 months for the group with severe defining diagnoses and serious complications. The matrix of AIDS-defining diagnoses and complications was divided into four severity categories with significantly different survival curves. This severity measure uses longitudinal data commonly available to clinicians and researchers to create distinct AIDS prognostic categories.\r"

Although the majority were celibate or monogamous during the prior year (men 52.5%, women 64.3%), many IVDUs had multiple sexual partners in that time, including 19.6% of men and 7.2% of women reporting five or more. Married male and female IVDUs were more likely to have multiple sexual partners than married people in general population samples. Only 38.5% of male and 35.4% of female IVDUs ever used condoms during the previous 5 years. Percentage of sexual encounters in which condoms were used correlated significantly with the number of partners for women (r = 0.37, p less than 0.01), but not for men (r = 0.03, ns). Use of intravenous drugs in the prior year, sharing of needles, use of stimulants, exchange of sex for money or drugs, and combining sexual events with drug use were all associated with greater numbers of sexual partners. A subset of male IVDUs engages in the dual-risk behaviors of needle sharing and unprotected intercourse with multiple partners. This group could act as a highly efficient vector for human immunodeficiency virus transmission and should become a focus of intensive preventive intervention.\r"

Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent.\r"

Both HIV-1- and HIV-2-seropositive individuals responded well to a peptide, JB-8pc (a.a. 427-448), representing the C-terminal end of the putative CD4-binding site of gp120 of HIV-1. The frequency of reactivity to three selected HIV-1 gag peptides derived from p17 and p15 was 60-70% in both HIV-1 and HIV-2-positive sera. To distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, the sera were titrated against the peptides. Although there was a high degree of cross-reactivity at lower serum dilutions, it was possible to discriminate the infections at higher dilutions to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 gp41/gp36 peptides JB-4c and JB-16c. Analysis of serum reactivity to several selected peptides thus allowed the identification of HIV infection, and the discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Liposomal encapsulation of AZT enhanced localization in the liver, spleen, and lung, and reduced localization in bone marrow. AZT administered i.v. (0.08-50 mg/kg/day) had significant bone marrow toxicity (30-50% reduction in cellularity) after five injections, maximum toxicity occurring at greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg/day. Parallel reductions in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes were observed. AZT encapsulated in liposomes had no bone marrow toxicity at doses of 0.08-10 mg/kg/day, and erythrocyte and leukocyte numbers remained normal. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus suppressed T- and B-cell mitogenic responses. Treatment of LP-BM5 retrovirus-infected mice with 2 mg/kg AZT three times weekly partially protected the mitogenic response at 4 but not at 7 weeks postinfection. Treatment with liposomal AZT resulted in normal T- and B-cell mitogenic responses at both 4 and 7 weeks postinfection.\r"

Resistance to acyclovir (ACV) and related compounds was linked to a thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) phenotype. After ACV discontinuation and a course of treatment with foscarnet, a new isolate was recovered, characterized by loss of the ACV-resistant trait and production of a functional TK enzyme. Data presented stress the need for monitoring chemosensitivity of HSV isolates in AIDS patients while suggesting that for better control of the infection, these patients should benefit from alternative treatments with drugs aimed at different viral targets.\r"

  ".W": "The tendency for older people with HIV infection to progress more rapidly to AIDS than younger people was studied in a group of 111 anti-HIV-positive haemophiliacs followed for up to 10 years from seroconversion. After 7 years of seropositivity, those aged over 30 years at the time of the first positive anti-HIV test had a cumulative progression rate to AIDS of 50%, compared with only 12% for those aged 10-19 years (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Overall, the relative risk of developing AIDS by any given time after seroconversion was 1.45 for each 10 year increase in age (p = 0.002; 95% confidence limits of 1.15, 1.85; Cox proportional hazards model). After adjustment for the CD4+ T-cell count (median of 10 count measurements per patient, fitted as a time-dependent covariate), the relative risk fell to 1.31 but remained statistically significant (p less than 0.05; 95% confidence limits of 1.03, 1.67). This implies that older people may be at higher risk of progression than their younger counterparts, even if their CD4+ T-cell counts are the same. Hence, prophylaxis against opportunistic infections may be indicated at higher CD4+ T-cell counts in older people than in younger people.\r"

Using a nested case control design, 54 asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositives who later progressed to AIDS were compared with 54 HIV-1 seropositives who did not progress and 54 seronegatives (mean follow-up time 2.5 years). Serum levels of copper and zinc were estimated from frozen serum samples, tissue levels from stored toenail samples, and dietary intakes from a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Neither dietary copper and zinc nor their levels in toenails were associated with HIV-1 seropositivity or progression to AIDS. However, serum copper levels were higher (p = 0.002) in HIV-1-seropositive progressors (mean = 115.6 micrograms/dl; SD = 17.1) than the seropositive nonprogressors (mean = 109.0 micrograms/dl; SD = 15.8) and the seronegatives (mean = 101.9 micrograms/dl; SD = 16.7). Conversely, serum zinc levels were lower (p = 0.016) in the seropositive progressors (mean = 85.2 micrograms/dl; SD = 11.5) than the seropositive nonprogressors (mean = 90.7 micrograms/dl; SD = 12.0) and the seronegatives (mean = 92.0 micrograms/dl; SD = 14.7). Furthermore, in a logistic regression, higher serum copper (odds ratio per 20-micrograms/dl increase = 2.23; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-4.87) and lower serum zinc (odds ratio per 20-micrograms/dl increase = 0.30; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.66) predicted progression to AIDS independently of baseline CD4+ lymphocyte level, age, and calorie-adjusted dietary intakes of both nutrients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, these studies have used general measures of frequency of both drinking and sexual behavior, giving insufficient information to establish that drinking and risky sex occur in the same sexual encounters. This article presents data from a mail survey of the adult population of San Francisco in which respondents were queried about the circumstances of specific sexual encounters that took place in conjunction with alcohol consumption. The results showed that subjective intoxication was related to practice of unsafe sex among homosexual men and heterosexual women but not among heterosexual men. In addition, respondents whose sexual partners were met in locations construed as \"pickup\" environments were more likely to practice safe sex. A focus on specific sexual events can contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of sexual encounters and of the predictors of risky sex in these encounters.\r"

  ".U": "91366580\r", 
  ".W": "This article investigates the supply and demand dynamics of sexual behavior in a simple epidemiological model of heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The supply and demand dynamics of sexual behavior are modeled by specifying implicit sexual behavior change (ISBC) mechanisms. These mechanisms specify how males and females modify their rates of sex partner change in response to changes in the availability of the opposite sex. During an epidemic, the availability of both sexes will change owing to recruitment and mortality; consequently, implicit sexual behavior changes will be induced. These behavior changes will be independent of any explicit sexual behavioral changes that may occur as a result of intervention strategies. We investigate four different ISBC mechanisms: the two extremes of the continuum of possible mechanisms (where only one sex changes behavior), as well as two intermediate possibilities (where both sexes change behavior). The results show that the epidemiological effects of these ISBC mechanisms depend upon the transmission speed of the virus. If HIV transmission is slow, the epidemiological effects of the four ISBC mechanisms cannot be differentiated. If HIV transmission is fast, the four ISBC mechanisms differ considerably in the degree to which they modify the gender-specific rates of sex partner change, but the sexual behavioral changes occur too late to significantly decrease the cumulative number of infected persons. However, if HIV transmission is moderately fast, the four different ISBC mechanisms produce significantly different epidemics. The differences between the epidemics, produced by the four ISBC mechanisms, are magnified as the degree of asymmetry between the heterosexual transmission efficiencies increases. We discuss the implications of our results for both the future number of AIDS cases that will be observed in the \"real world\" and the number of AIDS cases that will be predicted from mathematical models. We also discuss the implications for studies that evaluate the causation of sexual behavior changes.\r"

Alcohol time- and dose-response curves were constructed for changes in TIF volume and the bioactive concentrations of testosterone and immunoreactive beta E (i-beta E). Alcohol (3 g/kg) decreased TIF volumes and increased TIF i-beta E secretion 0.5 to 6 hr after injection and decreased TIF testosterone 1 to 6 hr after injection. These effects were dose-related at 2 hr postinjection. The possible role of alcohol-induced reductions in serum luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels in mediating the effects of alcohol on TIF volume was also examined. We found that pretreating rats with human chorionic gonadotropin, which reversed alcohol-induced suppression in levels of serum gonadotropins and testosterone, failed to reverse the effects of alcohol on TIF volume and the secretion of testosterone and i-beta E. These results indicate that alcohol decreases TIF volume, inhibits TIF testosterone secretion and stimulates TIF i-beta E secretion and, furthermore, suggest that these effects are not indirectly mediated by decreased levels of gonadotropins or testosterone, but by direct effects of alcohol on gonadal function. The strong inverse correlation between TIF i-beta E and testosterone secretion after alcohol administration and previous evidence that testicular opioids inhibit the biosynthesis of testosterone suggest that alcohol may act through testicular beta E to suppress the synthesis and release of testosterone in the testes.\r"

All of these drugs increased both punished and unpunished responding, although higher doses decreased responding. The order of potency for increasing punished responding was MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoa(a,d)-cyclohepten-5,1 0-imine] greater than [1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine] = PCP greater than (+)-N-allylnormetazocine = (-)-N-allynormetazocine. There was a high correlation (0.95) between the relative potency of these drugs in increasing punished responding and their relative affinity for PCP receptors. Because some of these drugs also bind to sigma receptors, drugs with a high affinity for sigma receptors, such as haloperidol, BD 737 [1S,2R-(-)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-N- methyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexylamine] and (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine, were also studied for their effects on punished and unpunished responding. These drugs produced only rate-decreasing effects. The correlation between the relative potency of drugs in increasing punished responding and their relative affinity for sigma receptors was low (-0.19). These data suggest that the PCP receptor is involved in some drug-induced increases in punished responding.\r"

Periodically after a bolus i.v. dose of CPFX (10 mg/kg), alone or with fenbufen (20 mg/kg), to rats, aliquots of CSF and blood were collected and then the whole brain was readily excised from the animal after sacrifice by microwave irradiation. Serum levels of CPFX in the terminal phase were significantly elevated by the coadministration with fenbufen. However, the extent of CPFX binding to serum protein was not affected by fenbufen. Immediately after the coadministration with fenbufen, brain and CSF levels of CPFX were raised by about 15 to 70% and 70 to 100%, respectively. Both brain/serum unbound and CSF/serum unbound level ratios were increased by fenbufen at relatively early periods after drug injection. Analysis based on physiological models indicated that fenbufen significantly increased the apparent diffusion clearances of CPFX across blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers. These findings suggest that coadministered fenbufen may facilitate the entry of CPFX into the central nervous system not only by elevation of serum level but also by enhancement of permeability across the blood-brain or blood-CSF barrier.\r"

Cellular uptake was regarded as indicating transport across the basolateral cell membrane inasmuch as the isolated tubules had no visible lumen under nonperfusing conditions. Cimetidine was accumulated in a concentrative manner in all segments of the proximal tubule. The cellular accumulation was, however, significantly higher in S2 and S3 segments than in the S1 segment. An analysis of cimetidine uptake by the S2 segment at cimetidine bath concentrations ranging from 5.10(-7) M to 10(-3) M provided evidence for the operation of a saturable and an apparently nonsaturable accumulation process. The saturable mechanism was assumed to represent a carrier-mediated active transport process. The intracellular cimetidine concentration was higher than expected from the electrochemical gradient and could be decreased by cooling the bath temperature from 37.5 degrees C to 22 degrees C. Potassium cyanide (10(-2) M) decreased the cimetidine cell/bath concentration ratio from 79.2 +/- 12.2 to 40.8 +/- 8.1. At a cimetidine bath concentration of 2 x 10(-7) M the cellular uptake of cimetidine was decreased to 40.8 +/- 6% of the control value by increasing the K+ concentration of the incubation medium from 5 mM to 35 mM. At a cimetidine concentration of 10(-3) M the uptake was decreased to 44.7 +/- 3.4% by the same experimental maneuver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The antidiuretic effect is progressive, reaching maximal levels in 4 to 5 days, and sustained, persisting for at least 24 hr after cessation of treatment. The antidiuretic profiles associated with these antagonists do not coincide with the profiles of potent ADH agonists, arginine vasopressin and 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. To investigate the mechanism of the antidiuretic effect of ADH antagonists, male diabetes insipidus rats were administered antagonists selective for the renal [adenylate cyclase-coupled (V2)] or pressor (phosphytidyl inositol-coupled) vasopressin receptor and urine output (volume and osmolality) and renal vasopressin receptor properties (concentration and affinity) were determined and compared to rats treated with arginine vasopressin or 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. After acute administration, only the V2-acting antagonists were antidiuretic, but were 3 orders of magnitude less potent than 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. Following chronic administration, all of the antagonists were antidiuretic, but the level of antidiuresis achieved with the phosphytidyl inositol-coupled vasopressin receptor-selective antagonist was 2- to 3-fold lower than for analogs with V2 activity. Maximal antidiuretic effects were realized in 5 days and were apparent at 24 hr after cessation of treatment. The antidiuretic activities and potencies of the ADH antagonists appeared to be increased following chronic antagonist administration. Finally, renal vasopressin receptor concentration was significantly elevated 24 hr after cessation of antagonist treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This has been modeled with a composed sigmoid Emax equation. To challenge this model, a selective antagonist, sulpiride, was administered simultaneously with apomorphine. Four short intravenous infusions of apomorphine, at different rates, were administered to rats, while a steady state concentration of sulpiride was maintained by intravenous infusion. Another group of rats was infused with apomorphine at the same rates of infusion as in the above groups, together with saline. In this latter group a biphasic concentration-response relationship was observed, while in the group receiving sulpiride and apomorphine no bradycardia was detected. A sigmoid Emax model with one term describing bradycardia and one tachycardia was used for the saline plus apomorphine data. For the sulpiride plus apomorphine data a single-term sigmoid Emax model was used. The maximal induced tachycardia was found to be the same in both groups. The tachycardia occurred at lower concentrations in the sulpiride group, probably as a result of an antagonist-induced shift of the bradycardia towards higher concentrations. The obtained results show that a composite concentration-effect curve of apomorphine has experimental validity and that it is possible to separate its pharmacodynamic characteristics on heart rate into its components, bradycardia and tachycardia, by sulpiride.\r"

Because Kupffer cells may contribute to hepatic xenobiotic metabolism, the current studies evaluated the presence and inducibility of P450 2E1 in rat Kupffer cells. Hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were isolated from the livers of control and acetone-treated (1% v/v acetone in the drinking water for 7 days) rats. P450 2E1 was immunochemically detectable at low levels in Kupffer cell homogenates from untreated rats and was induced greater than 10-fold by acetone-treatment. The presence of P450 2E1 in Kupffer cells from untreated rats was confirmed by inhibition of benzene hydroxylation with anti-P450 2E1 immunoglobulin G. Benzene hydroxylase activity was induced 16.3-fold in Kupffer cells isolated from acetone-treated rats and remained 70% inhibitable by anti-P450 2E1 antibody. The benzene hydroxylase activity of hepatocytes from the same animals was induced 3.9-fold by acetone treatment. The specific activity for benzene hydroxylation of Kupffer cell homogenates from acetone-treated rats was nearly equal to that for the hepatocytes from the same animals. The presence and inducibility of P450 2E1 in Kupffer cells suggests that, under conditions where P450 2E1 is induced, Kupffer cell-generated metabolites may contribute to Kupffer cell toxicity, as well as general hepatic injury.\r"

  ".U": "91366591\r", 
  ".W": "[D-Pen2,4'-125I-Phe4,D-Pen5]enkephalin ([125I]DPDPE) is a highly selective radioligand for the delta opioid receptor with a specific activity (2200 Ci/mmol) that is over 50-fold greater than that of tritium-labeled DPDPE analogs. [125I]DPDPE binds to a single site in rat brain membranes with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value of 421 +/- 67 pM and a receptor density (Bmax) value of 36.4 +/- 2.7 fmol/mg protein. The high affinity of this site for delta opioid receptor ligands and its low affinity for mu or kappa receptor-selective ligands are consistent with its being a delta opioid receptor. The distribution of these sites in rat brain, observed by receptor autoradiography, is also consistent with that of delta opioid receptors. Association and dissociation binding kinetics of 1.0 nM [125I] DPDPE are monophasic at 25 degrees C. The association rate (k + 1 = 5.80 +/- 0.88 X 10(7) M-1 min-1) is about 20- and 7-fold greater than that measured for 1.0 nM [3H DPDPE and 0.8 nM [3H] [D-Pen2,4'-Cl-Phe4, D-Pen5]enkephalin, respectively. The dissociation rate of [125I]DPDPE (0.917 +/- 0.117 X 10(-2) min-1) measured at 1.0 nM is about 3-fold faster than is observed for either of the other DPDPE analogs. The rapid binding kinetics of [125I]DPDPE is advantageous because binding equilibrium is achieved with much shorter incubation times than are required for other cyclic enkephalin analogs. This, in addition to its much higher specific activity, makes [125I]DPDPE a valuable new radioligand for studies of delta opioid receptors.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine which amino acid residues between positions 8 to 12 are directly involved in ensuring high affinity and antagonist properties at CGRP receptors. In brain, atrium and vas deferens membrane preparations, hCGRP8-37 and hCGRP9-37 demonstrated affinities similar to or much higher than that of the native peptide hCGRP alpha. Shorter fragments such as hCGRP 10-37 and hCGRP 11-37 possessed less than 20% of the affinity of hCGRP alpha in these various assays demonstrating the critical importance of the Thr residue in position 9 for maintenance of adequate receptor affinity. In the in vitro guinea pig left and right atria bioassays, both hCGRP8-37 and hCGRP9-37 behaved as potent and competitive antagonists (pA2:7.0-7.7) of positive chronotropic and inotropic effects induced by hCGRP alpha. hCGRP 10-37 and hCGRP 11-37 were at least 10 times less potent (pA2: 6.1-6.6). Interestingly, both hCGRP 8-37 and hCGRP9-37 were much less potent (pA2: 6.2-6.3) in blocking the effects of hCGRP alpha in the rat vas deferens whereas only slight inhibition was observed at 1.0 microM with hCGRP10-37 and no blocking activity was detected with hCGRP11-37 at a low micromolar concentration. These results are in accordance with binding data and demonstrate further the importance of residues in positions 9 (Thr) and 10 (His) to ensure potent antagonistic properties of N-truncated hCGRP fragments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Evidence from contractile, radioisotope ion flux and electrophysiological studies suggest that minoxidil sulfate (MNXS) acts as a K+ channel opener in vascular smooth muscle. This study was designed to examine possible biochemical mechanisms by which MNXS exerts such an effect. Experiments performed in the isolated rabbit mesenteric artery (RMA) showed that MNXS, 5 microM, but not the parent compound minoxidil, was a potent vasodilator. Whereas the relaxant effects of an another K+ channel opener vasodilator, BRL-34915 (cromakalim), were removed by washing with physiological saline solution, the effects of MNXS persisted after repeated washout attempts. Furthermore, after an initial exposure of segments of intact RMA to [35S] MNXS, greater than 30% of the radiolabel was retained 2 hr after removal of the drug. In contrast, retention of radiolabel was not detected with either [3H]MNXS (label on the piperidine ring of MNXS) or [3H]minoxidil (each less than 3% after a 2-hr washout). These data suggested that the sulfate moiety from MNXS was closely associated with the vascular tissue. To determine if proteins were the acceptors of sulfate from MNXS, intact RMAs were incubated with [35S]MNXS, and then 35S-labeled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by fluorography. Preferential labeling of a 116 kD protein was detected by 2 and 5 min of treatment. A 43 kD protein (resembling actin) also showed significant labeling. A similar profile of 35S-labeled proteins was observed in [35S] MNXS-treated A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the majority of proteins labeled by [35S]MNXS in intact RMA were components of smooth muscle cells.

  ".W": "The effects of cisapride on intestinal contractility and on release of acetylcholine (ACh) were examined using the longitudinal muscle with the myenteric plexus preparation from the guinea pig ileum, as related to the 5-hydoxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor. 5-HT exerted a dual effect, transient increase in ACh release (EC50 = 2 X 10(-6)M) via the 5-HT3 receptor, followed by inhibition (EC50 = 5 X 10(-9)M) via the 5-HT1 receptor. Cisapride at low concentrations (10(-9)M to 10(-8)M) enhanced electrical stimulation -evoked contraction and ACh release. The effect of cisapride was mimicked by methysergide and was not altered by ICS 205-930. Cisapride antagonized the 5-HT (5 X 10(-9) M)-induced inhibitory effect and the IC50 of cisapride was 1.5 X 10(-9) M. These findings indicate that enhancement by low concentrations of cisapride may be due to a block of the inhibitory 5-HT1 receptor. Cisapride at medium concentrations (10(-8) M to 3 X 10(-7) M) induced enhancement of electrical stimulation-evoked twitch contractions and ACh release evoked by electrical stimulation which were antagonized by 10(-6) M ICS 205-930, while this compound antagonized the 5-HT (2 X 10(-6) M)-and 2-methyl-5-HT-induced excitatory effects, and the IC50 of cisapride was 5.2 X 10(-8) M. Thus, cisapride acts on the putative 5-HT4 receptor as an agonist and the 5-HT3 receptor as an antagonist. Cisapride at high concentrations (10(-6) M to 10(-5) M) evoked contraction and the release of ACh, and these effects were antagonized by ICS 205-930 (10(-6) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thapsigargin (TSG), a putative selective Ca(++)-ATPase inhibitor, has been used to study Ca++ mobilization in many non-excitable cell types. This study aims to determine whether TSG is effective as a selective microsomal Ca++ uptake inhibitor by studying its ability to affect repletion of the phenylephrine (PE)-sensitive Ca++ pool in rat aorta and dog mesenteric artery evaluated by contractility studies. TSG caused a concentration-dependent contraction that was dependent on the concentration of extracellular Ca++. Ca++ influx promoted by TSG was found to occur mostly through L-type Ca++ channels in the dog mesenteric artery but not in the rat aorta. When arterial rings, depleted of their PE-sensitive internal store, were allowed to replete their stores in normal Krebs' solution or in the presence of elevated K+ levels, it was found that repletion was significantly enhanced in the presence of elevated K+. In TSG-treated rings, however, repletion was significantly inhibited under both conditions as indicated by the subsequent PE-induced contraction in Ca(++)-free medium. While the rate of contraction induced by elevated K+ levels was slow immediately after pool depletion in controls, it was rapid in TSG-treated arterial rings. The slow onset of K+ contraction may reflect Ca++ uptake into the pool which was absent in TSG-treated arteries. Differences in the behavior of the two arteries were noted and these may reflect differences in the size of their Ca++ store and their coupling to the extracellular space. Single cells isolated from the dog mesenteric artery were also found to shorten in response to TSG to an amount comparable with that obtained from whole tissue experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mice were administered 1 KE of OK432 and 10(4)U/g of rIFN alpha A/D starting 24 hr after viral inoculation for 14 days. The survival rate of mice having the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of untreated mice on day 21 (15 of 20 vs. 6 of 20, P less than .001), whereas the viral titer in the heart, the heart weight/body weight ratio and the scores for myocardial inflammation and necrosis were significantly lower. On the other hand, therapy with OK432 or rIFN alpha A/D individually improved neither the survival rate nor the extent of myocardial damage. The natural killer cell activity in the combination therapy mice on day 3 after infection was significantly increased in comparison with untreated mice (46.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 37.7 +/- 2.8%, P less than .01), and the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages was increased (45.0 vs. 26.7%). Thus, the combination therapy of OK432 and rIFN alpha A/D was more effective than the therapy with OK432 alone or rIFN alpha A/D alone against acute viral myocarditis when the treatment was started early after infection, and the stimulation of host immunologic response by OK432 may be important for this combination therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Human osteoblasts derived from long bone periosteum were induced to mineralize in culture in the presence of 2 mM alpha-glycerophosphate, with typical characteristics of mineralization, namely, accumulation of hydroxyapatite and increases in alkaline phosphatase activity and in osteocalcin production. Mineralization was also enhanced by 10(-8) M 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In this system, a prostaglandin A1 derivative, TEI-3313, with the chemical structure 5-[(Z,2E)-4,7-dihydroxy-2-heptenyridene]-4-hydroxy-2-methylthio-4- (4- phenoxybutyl)-2-cyclopentenone, was found to enhance mineralization as effectively as 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, although its potency was 10 times lower than that of the vitamin D3 metabolite. Osteocalcin, a bone-specific noncollagenous matrix protein, accumulated onto the cell layers by treatment with TEI-3313 to a much greater extent than those released into the culture medium. TEI-3313 also enhanced collagen synthesis. Based on the finding that TEI-3313 enhanced the synthesis of both collagen and noncollagenous protein, it is speculated that TEI-3313 enhanced the mineralization by stimulating the expression of various genes in osteoblasts.\r"

Female DBA mice were implanted with jugular cannulas and infused with saline or various doses of nicotine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/hr) for 10 days. The animals were then sacrificed and the brains were removed and frozen in isopentane. Cryostat sections were collected and prepared for autoradiographic procedures as previously described. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors were labeled with L-[3H]nicotine or alpha-[125I]bungarotoxin; [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was used to measure muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding. Chronic nicotine infusion increased the number of sites labeled by [3H]nicotine in most brain areas. However, the extent of the increase in binding as well as the dose-response curves for the increase were widely different among brain regions. After the highest treatment dose, binding was increased in 67 of 86 regions measured. Septal and thalamic regions were most resistant to change. Nicotinic binding measured by alpha-[125I]bungarotoxin also increased after chronic treatment, but in a less robust fashion. At the highest treatment dose, only 26 of 80 regions were significantly changes. Muscarinic binding was not altered after chronic nicotine treatment. These data suggest that brain regions are not equivalent in the mechanisms that regulate alterations in nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding after chronic nicotine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of these studies was to determine whether the muscarinic receptor-mediated autoregulation of the basal release of acetylcholine (ACh), like the modulation of evoked release, involves 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive potassium channels. To accomplish this, striatal and hippocampal slices were incubated with 4-AP in the absence or presence of atropine, and the release of ACh was measured. 4-AP increased the release of ACh in a concentration-dependent manner; a maximal effect (280% of control release) was achieved in the presence of 100 microM. The maximal release of ACh from hippocampal slices was approximately 150% of control release and was achieved in the presence of a broad range of concentrations (33-333 microM 4-AP). Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) totally abolished the 4-AP-induced release of ACh from hippocampal slices, but only attenuated the 4-AP-induced release from striatal slices, i.e., in the presence of tetrodotoxin, the 4-AP-induced release of ACh from the latter was significantly greater than control release by 54%. Atropine (0.1 microM) increased significantly the basal release of ACh from striatal slices by 61%. When striatal slices were incubated with 4-AP in the presence of this maximally effective concentration of atropine, ACh release was significantly greater than release from slices incubated with either atropine or 4-AP alone, suggesting that atropine and 4-AP increase neurotransmitter release by independent mechanisms. Although oxotremorine did not alter either the 4-AP- or atropine-induced release of ACh, it prevented the potentiated response exhibited by slices incubated with both atropine and 4-AP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous and intraportal venous infusions of exogenous adenosine (0.04-1.0 mg/kg/min) did not recirculate to cause increases in superior mesenteric arterial conductance (SMAC) or arterial plasma adenosine levels except at the higher doses tested (0.4-1.0 mg/kg/min). After administration of dilazep, however, even low doses (0.04-0.1 mg/kg/min) of exogenous adenosine significantly increased SMAC and elevated arterial plasma adenosine concentration. The increased adenosine levels were highly correlated with the increased percentage of change of SMAC and values for Rmax and EC50 were 193.4 +/- 27.3% change of SMAC and 2.8 +/- 1.3 microM, respectively. Administration of bolus doses of 8-phenyltheophylline abolished the ability of dilazep to potentiate vasodilation, but did not affect isoproterenol-induced relaxation. Together, these results suggest that potentiation of the vasodilating effect of exogenous adenosine by dilazep is mediated through inhibition of adenosine uptake in vivo which increases the availability of plasma adenosine to act on adenosine receptors.\r"

DT and RT in the ventricular wall perfused with pH 7.9 media for 6 min during reperfusion were 40 +/- 5.9 and 285 +/- 13%, respectively, of the preischemic values (P less than .05 vs. pH 7.2 group). The Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA), effectively antagonized the detrimental effect of pH 7.9 media. A pH 6.5 media inhibited DT recovery and the rise in RT in the first 6 min of reperfusion. Subsequent reperfusion with pH 7.2 media resulted in cardiac dysfunction similar to that observed when reperfused at pH 7.2 only. Cellular Na+ and Ca++ were significantly elevated after 6 min of reperfusion at pH 7.2. Na+ and Ca++ levels were increased further if reperfusion was carried out at pH 7.9. Inclusion of 20 microM DMA during reperfusion at 7.9 significantly reduced cellular Na+ and Ca++. Creatine phosphokinase activity in the coronary effluent rose significantly during reperfusion at pH 7.2 and this was exacerbated if the reperfusion pH was 7.9. DMA treatment during reperfusion could significantly inhibit this elevation. The data lend further support for an important role of Na(+)-H+ exchange in the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"

In this study, the effect of stimulation rate on action potential characteristics was studied in Cs-treated and TEA-loaded canine Purkinje fiber preparations. Action potentials of Purkinje fibers from Cs-treated and TEA-loaded preparations had longer durations than action potentials of Purkinje fibers from normal preparations. Greater prolongation of action potential duration was observed when the rate of stimulation was reduced in Purkinje fibers from Cs-treated and TEA-loaded preparations than those from normal preparations. Whereas the increase in action potential duration of Purkinje fibers from Cs-treated preparations was accompanied by a significant membrane depolarization, no change in membrane potential was observed in Purkinje fibers from TEA-loaded preparations. In some Cs-treated and TEA-loaded preparations, the prolonged duration observed at slow stimulation rates was associated with the appearance of early afterdepolarizations. Lidocaine and cromakalim, agents known to reduce action potential duration in normal Purkinje fibers, also shortened action potential duration in Purkinje fibers from both Cs-treated and TEA-loaded preparations. However, lidocaine and cromakalim caused a significant membrane depolarization in Cs-treated Purkinje fibers but not in TEA-loaded Purkinje fibers. Our results suggested that although Cs and TEA are capable of producing rate-dependent prolongation of action potential duration and the occurrence of bradycardia-dependent early afterdepolarization, differences exist in Cs-treated Purkinje fibers in terms of the appearance of membrane depolarization at reduced stimulation rate and in the presence of lidocaine and cromakalim.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of receptors for LTB4 on highly purified guinea pig alveolar eosinophils was investigated. Massive infiltration of eosinophils in alveolar spaces was induced in guinea pigs by i.v. injections of Sephadex beads G50 (16 mg/kg). Alveolar eosinophils (50 x 10(6) cells) were purified to approximately 98% by Percoll continuous density gradient centrifugation. The binding studies indicated that alveolar eosinophils bind LTB4 in a saturable, reversible and specific manner. Scatchard analysis indicated the existence of high-affinity binding sites (Kd1 = 1.00 +/- 0.22 nM; Bmax1 = 966 +/- 266 sites/cell) and low-affinity binding sites (Kd2 = 62.5 +/- 8.9 nM; Bmax2 = 5557 +/- 757 sites/cell). The metabolism of LTB4 by alveolar eosinophils in binding conditions was assessed by RP-HPLC and no significant degradation of [3H]LTB4 was observed. LTB4 dose-dependently stimulated eosinophil migration in both chemokinesis and chemotaxis assays with an EC50 value of 1.30 +/- 0.14 and 18.14 +/- 1.57 nM, respectively. LTB4 caused a dose-dependent increase in the production of superoxide anion with an apparent EC50 value of 50 X 10(-9) M in our experimental conditions. LTB4 also induced a dose-dependent increase in the generation of TxA2 with an EC50 value of 46.2 X 10(-9) M. Taken together, our results demonstrated that guinea pig alveolar eosinophils express two classes of specific receptors for LTB4. The high-affinity binding sites seem associated to chemokinesis and chemotaxis whereas the low-affinity binding sites seem associated to superoxide anion production and generation of TxA2. The existence of LTB4 receptors in eosinophils could explain the presence of these cells in hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

  ".U": "91366606\r", 
  ".W": "This study was concerned with the role of Cu and Cu-MT (metallothionein) in oxidative stress. Because hepatic Cu and Cu-MT concentrations are known to be high in the 3-day-old guinea pigs but decline to low adult levels by 7 days of life, the hepatotoxicity of ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA) in the developing guinea pig was used as the experimental model in the present study. Results of this study showed that the hepatotoxic response to FeNTA (3.5 mg Fe /kg i.p.) as measured by elevation in serum aspartate aminotransferase activity, increase in lipid peroxidation, decrease in reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio and histopathological changes was higher in 3-day-old than in 7-day-old and adult guinea pigs. Furthermore, pretreatment of 7-day-old guinea pigs with cupric sulfate (0.5 mg Cu++/kg i.p.) increased hepatic Cu and Cu-MT levels and enhanced susceptibility to FeNTA. FeNTA treatment resulted in the oxidation of MT thiolates and reduction in the metal binding capacity and Cu content of MT in the 3-day-old and Cu-pretreated 7-day-old animals, providing evidence for the interaction between Cu-MT and cellular oxidants. In vitro study with FeNTA and hepatic microsomes revealed no age-related differences in microsomal lipid peroxidation; however, this parameter was stimulated in the presence of control or heat-treated cytosols isolated from 3-day-old but not those of 7-day-old animals. These observations were consistent with the involvement of Cu-MT, a heat-stable metalloprotein, in the sensitization of hepatic tissues to oxidative injury in the 3-day-old animal. Moreover, in vitro study involving the use of D-penicillamine, a Cu chelating agent, showed that the sensitization effect of Cu-MT was mediated by Cu ions. The results of this study suggest that Cu-MT may have a prooxidative property and tissues with high Cu-MT levels may be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress.\r"

Incubation of human washed platelets with CPT, SQ 14,534, TPR, ENA, MPG or NAC (0.1-0.5 mM) did not modify their aggregatory responses to thrombin. However, the antiaggregatory properties of endothelial cells cultured from bovine aorta were potentiated by CPT, SQ 14,534, MPG or NAC but not by TPR or ENA (40-100 microM). CPT (100-500 microM) or NAC (50-200 microM) but not ENA (100 and 500 microM) also potentiated the antiaggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside (1.0 microM) or iloprost (0.2 nM). The ability of the thiol-containing compounds (CPT or NAC) to potentiate the antiaggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside or iloprost was not associated with an elevation of platelet cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP levels, respectively. Thus, CPT and other sulfhydryl-containing compounds can synergize with antiplatelet compounds, thereby enhancing the ability of endothelial-derived autocoids to inhibit platelet aggregation. The mechanism responsible for this potentiating effect of thiols on platelet aggregation is not known, but may relate to the ability of thiol-containing compounds to act as intracellular scavengers of oxygen-derived free radicals.\r"

Lectins from Limax flavus and Triticum vulgaris, both of which have affinity for sialic acid, were antagonists of the various serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin and tetanus toxin. When tested against the high affinity binding site for botulinum neurotoxin type B, the lectin from Limax flavus had a Ki of 3.1 x 10(-7) M and the lectin from Triticum vulgaris had a Ki of 3.75 x 10(-7) M. When tested against the high affinity binding site for tetanus toxin, the lectins from Limax flavus and Triticum vulgaris had Ki values of 1.5 x 10(-7) and 1 x 10(-6) M, respectively. In all cases the lectins behaved as competitive antagonists. In reverse experiments, neither botulinum toxin nor tetanus toxin was a very effective antagonist of lectin binding to brain membranes. Studies on isolated neuromuscular preparations showed that the lectin from Triticum vulgaris did not affect transmission at concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-3) M, but at a concentration of 3 x 10(-5) M the lectin produced highly statistically significant antagonism of the neuromuscular blocking properties of botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, C, D, E and F as well as tetanus toxin. The lectin did not antagonize beta-bungarotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PCP on release of the two pituitary hormones also derived from the adrenocorticotropin precursor, namely, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin (beta-E), synthesized in the neurointermediate and anterior lobes of the pituitary. At behaviorally active doses, PCP administered i.c.v. increased plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-E (i beta-E) without affecting the concentration of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, suggesting that PCP increased the release of beta-E from only the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Dexamethasone pretreatment blocked the PCP-induced increase in i beta-E which indicated further the anterior lobe effects of PCP. MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), a selective PCP ligand, at behaviorally active doses also increased the plasma concentration of i beta-E. The dose-response curves for induction of behavior was very different from that for increasing the concentration of i beta-E in plasma. The increase in release of i beta-E was stereoselective as (+)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine but not (-)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine increased release of i beta-E. The increase in plasma levels of beta-E was not due to an interaction with opioid receptors because naloxone did not block PCP-induced release of beta-E. In vitro, PCP also significantly increased release of i beta-E from anterior lobe of the pituitary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in the rabbit aortic rings, precontracted with norepinephrine, to determine the subtype(s) of muscarinic receptors involved in endothelium-dependent relaxation and contraction in the absence of endothelium elicited by cholinergic stimuli. Acetylcholine (ACh) and arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), a M2 and M3 agonist, produced a dose-dependent relaxation and contraction in endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rabbit aortic rings, respectively. Both of these responses were blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. M1 selective agonist McN-A-343 [4-[N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy]-2-butinyltrimethylammonium+ ++ chloride] did not produce any effect on the tone of precontracted aortic rings. ACh- and APE-induced relaxation in aortic rings with intact endothelium was selectively blocked by M3 receptor antagonists hexahydrosila-difenidol and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pA2 of 7.84 and 7.18) but not by M1 antagonist pirenzepine or M2 receptor antagonists AF-DX 116 [11-(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]- 1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-[2,3-b][1,4]-benzo-diazepin-6-one] and methoctramine. ACh- and APE-induced contraction was inhibited by M2 receptor antagonists AF-DX 116 and methoctramine (pA2 of 7.11 and 6.71) but not by pirenzepine, hexahydro-sila-difenidol or p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol. ACh- and APE-induced relaxation or contraction were not altered by nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium or cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. These data suggest that relaxation elicited by cholinergic stimulin in endothelium-intact aortic rings is mediated via release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor consequent to activation of M3 receptors located on endothelial cells, whereas the contraction in aortic rings denuded of their endothelium is mediated via stimulation of M2 receptors located on smooth muscle cells.\r"

High doses of caffeine can produce subjective feelings of anxiety, dysphoria and depression. The present study was designed to model these different subjective states in rats using a discrete trial shock avoidance/escape drug discrimination paradigm. Rats were trained to discriminate between i.p. injections of saline and either 10 or 56 mg/kg of caffeine. Rats trained at 10 mg/kg of caffeine acquired the discrimination in an average of 93 sessions and generalized completely to a variety of xanthine and nonxanthine behavioral stimulants including: d-amphetamine, apomorphine, 7-(beta-chloroethyl)theophylline, 9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5,6-dihydro-1, 2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-imine (CGS 15943), cocaine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, diethylpropion, beta-hydroxyethyltheophylline, methylphenidate, phenidimetrazine and theophylline. Rats trained at 56 mg/kg of caffeine acquired the discrimination in an average of 43 sessions and generalized completely only to theophylline. A variety of drugs representing diverse pharmacologic classifications including: benzodiazepine inverse agonists, pentylenetetrazol, yohimbine, ethylketocyclazocine and phencyclidine, were not generalized from either training dose, demonstrating the pharmacologic specificity of the discrimination. The discriminative effects of 10 mg/kg of caffeine appear to derive from a state of behavioral arousal, possibly mediated by catecholamines, and parallel the subjective effects produced by low doses of caffeine in humans. The discriminative effects of 56 mg/kg of caffeine are qualitatively different from those of 10 mg/kg but cannot be defined further at this time.\r"

One group of rats was pretreated with a specific and highly efficacious competitive antagonist of bradykinin receptor (BKRA), whereas the other group received only a vehicle infusion. The left kidney was denervated in each animal and the right kidney remained intact. After control observations, the extracellular fluid volume was expanded by a continuous i.v. infusion of 0.9% NaCl at a rate of 0.25% of body weight per minute for 40 min (VE). During VE urine flow and sodium excretion increased significantly from both kidneys in each of the two treatment groups. The diuretic response was greatest in the denervated kidneys of vehicle-pretreated rats, where urine flow increased by 70 +/- 13 microliters.min(-1).g kwt(-1). This exaggerated diuresis was blunted by pretreatment with the BKRA. In the denervated and BKRA-treated kidneys, the VE-induced mean urine flow increase was limited to 31 +/- 5 microliters.min(-1).g kwt(-1) (P less than .05 compared with vehicle-pretreated, denervated kidneys).

  ".W": "A biochemical basis for the development of tolerance to morphine has yet to be defined. Although a number of models have been proposed, none can account for complete tolerance to this drug. Previous studies in our laboratory indicated that the development of complete tolerance to certain morphine-induced behaviors (antinociception, catalepsy and respiratory depression) is associated with changes in the activity of some form(s) of phosphodiesterase with cyclic GMP as substrate (cGMP-PDE) activity in the brain areas that mediate these behaviors (periaqueductal gray, striatum and medulla). In the present study, experiments were performed in which Cyclo(Leu-Gly), a dipeptide that inhibits the development of tolerance to morphine, was administered daily (2 mg/kg) to morphine-naive rats, coadministered with morphine or coadministered with morphine to morphine-tolerant rats and the cGMP-PDE activity was measured. The development of tolerance to the effects was inhibited or reversed by administration of cyclo(Leu-Gly) and there were corresponding changes in cGMP-PDE activity in various brain regions. Differences in cGMP hydrolysis between brain regions from morphine-tolerant animals, tolerance-inhibited animals and tolerance-reversed animals strengthens the evidence for direct involvement of cGMP-PDE(s) in tolerance phenomena.\r"

This pathway is also intricately involved in the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine and the progressive increases (sensitization) in this behavior observed after repeated administration of cocaine and other psychomotor stimulants. By using single-cell electrophysiological recording and microiontophoretic techniques, we demonstrated previously that repeated cocaine administration (10 mg/kg i.p., twice daily, 14 days) renders impulse-regulating somatodendritic A10 DA autoreceptors subsensitive, thereby increasing impulse flow within the mesoaccumbens DA system. In striking contrast, inhibitory responses of NAc neurons to iontophoretic DA were significantly increased in cocaine-treated rats tested 16 to 24 hr after the last cocaine injection. In the present study, iontophoretic application of selective D1 (SKF 38393) and D2 (quinpirole) DA receptor agonists was utilized to determine the extent to which each of these DA receptor subtypes is altered by repeated cocaine administration. After 2 weeks of twice daily cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p.) injections, significant increases in the inhibitory responses of NAc neurons to SKF 38393, but not quinpirole, were observed. In addition, this D1 receptor sensitization was still evident when animals were tested either 7 days or 1 month after the final cocaine injection. After 2 months of withdrawal from cocaine treatment, D1 receptor sensitivity in the NAc had returned to control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of central serotonin 5HT2 receptors is believed to be the primary mechanism whereby lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and other hallucinogens induce psychoactive effects. This hypothesis is based on extensive radioligand binding and electrophysiological and behavioral studies in laboratory animals. However, the pharmacological profiles of 5HT2 and 5HT1C receptors are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between effects due to activation of one or the other receptor. For this reason, it was of interest to investigate the interaction of LSD with 5HT1C receptors. Agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in rat choroid plexus was used as a direct measure of 5HT1C receptor activation. (+)LSD potently stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in intact choroid plexus and in cultures of choroid plexus epithelial cells, with EC50 values of 9 and 26 nM, respectively. The effect of (+)LSD in both systems was blocked by 5HT receptor antagonists with an order of activity consistent with interaction at 5HT1C receptors. Neither (+)-2-bromo-LSD nor lisuride, two nonhallucinogenic congeners of LSD, were able to stimulate 5HT1C receptors in cultured cells or intact choroid plexus. In contrast, lisuride, like (+)LSD, is a partial agonist at 5HT2 receptors in cerebral cortex slices and in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with 5HT2 receptor cDNA. The present finding that (+)LSD, but not its nonhallucinogenic congeners, is a 5HT1C receptor agonist suggests a possible role for these receptors in mediating the psychoactive effects of LSD.\r"

  ".W": "The disposition of the beta-2 adrenoreceptor agonist, ritodrine, has been examined in the fetal lamb during and after constant rate fetal intravenous infusion (8-24 h). Samples were collected from the fetal femoral artery, umbilical vein, maternal femoral artery, uterine vein, fetal trachea and the amniotic activity for ritodrine quantitation. The amniotic fluid was also analyzed for conjugated metabolites of ritodrine. Ritodrine appears to be cleared across the sheep placenta only to a limited extent (placental clearance 9.2 +/- 2 ml/min/kg; mean +/- S.E.M.). There is, however, significant fetal nonplacental clearance of ritodrine (fetal nonplacental clearance 52.8 +/- 8.0 ml/min/kg). At least part of this clearance appears to be due to fetal drug metabolism, as evidenced by the accumulation of glucuronide conjugates of ritodrine in the amniotic fluid. Ritodrine was also shown to accumulate in the amniotic and fetal tracheal fluids and persist after fetal arterial plasma ritodrine concentrations became undetectable. The accumulation of ritodrine in the tracheal fluid may be of pharmacologic significance, given the well documented, potent effects of beta-2 agonists on fetal lung function and development.\r"

  ".W": "In cerebellar granule cells, baclofen acted with micromolar concentrations at proposed gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptors to inhibit the formation of cyclic AMP and depolarization-induced release of glutamate. Nanomolar concentrations of baclofen inhibited depolarization-induced influx of calcium. All three responses to baclofen were attenuated after pertussis toxin pretreatment of cell cultures. The inhibition of calcium influx and glutamate release were reversed by the cyclic AMP analog, 8-(4-chlorphenylthio)-cyclic AMP. The release of glutamate was dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium, which enters the cell through dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent calcium channels. Because the decrease in calcium influx by baclofen and nifedipine were additive, the baclofen-mediated decrease in calcium influx may not involve a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel. These results show similarities between the baclofen-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP formation and glutamate release, suggesting a relationship between these two events. The baclofen-mediated inhibition of calcium influx may not be related to baclofen's inhibition of glutamate release.\r"

We used Na(+)-sensitive microelectrodes to measure changes in intracellular Na+ activity (aiNa) associated with positive inotropic and toxic effects of acetylstrophanthidin (AS) and a semisynthetic agent, actodigin. Measurements of aiNa, twitch tension and transmembrane potential were made in sheep Purkinje fibers stimulated at 0.03, 1 and 2 Hz. Ca(+)+i overload toxicity was indicated by the presence of transient depolarizations (TD). The following results were obtained: 1) at a stimulation frequency of 1 Hz, aiNa was significantly higher at peak tension with AS (13.6 +/- 1.1 mM) than with actodigin (11.0 +/- 0.4 mM, P less than .01), yet TD occurred at the same aiNa (10.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 11.9 +/- 0.7 mM, respectively, N.S.); 2) at frequencies of 1 to 2 Hz, aiNa was lower when TD occurred (10.4 +/- 0.9 mM at 2 Hz) than at peak tension (12.1 +/- 0.8 mM, P less than .05) during exposure to AS, whereas aiNa was the same at peak tension (10.6 +/- 1.1 mM) and when TD occurred (10.5 +/- 1.1 mM, N.S.) during exposure to actodigin; 3) the degree of positive inotropy at a high stimulation frequency (2 Hz) was significantly greater with actodigin (about 12-fold increase in force compared to control) than with AS (about 6-fold increase in force).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of rats were trained to discriminate either a low (1 mg/kg) or a high (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneal dose of diazepam from vehicle injections in a two-lever, food-reinforcement procedure. Comparison of the dose-response curves demonstrated a difference in the intensity of the stimulus effects. A number of benzodiazepine agonists and partial agonists were tested for stimulus generalization. The stimulus effect in both groups of rats generalized fully to triazolam, alprazolam, adinazolam and pentobarbital. Ro 17-1812 occasioned nearly full generalization in both groups of rats with a shallow dose-response slope. The low-, but not the high-dose stimulus effect generalized to the following compounds: CL 218872, ZK 91296 (ethyl-5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate), CGS 20625 (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydrocyclohepta(b)pyrazo lo(3,4- d)pyridin-3-one) and U-78875 (3-(5-cyclo-propyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-(1- methylethyl)imidazol(1,5-a)quinoxalin-4(5H)-o-ne). Flumazenil, FD-7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide), buspirone and morphine occasioned predominantly vehicle-appropriate responses in both groups of rats.

Concentration-dependent uptake of acetic acid was observed, and the kinetic parameters were estimated as follows: the Michaelis constant, Kt, was 3.41 +/- 1.87 mM, the maximum uptake rate, Jmax, was 144.7 +/- 55.7 nmol/mg of protein/min and the nonsaturable first-order rate constant, Kd, was 6.66 +/- 1.98 microliters/mg of protein/min. At medium pH below 7.0, the uptake rate of [3H]acetic acid increased markedly with decreasing medium pH, whereas pH-independent uptake was observed in the presence of 10 mM acetic acid. An energy requirement for [3H]acetic acid uptake was also demonstrated, because metabolic inhibitors (2,4-dinitrophenol and rotenone) reduced significantly the uptake rate (P less than .05). Carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone, a protonophore, inhibited significantly the uptake of [3H]acetic acid at medium pH of 5.0 and 6.0, whereas 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilben-2,2'-disulfonic acid did not. Several MCAs inhibited significantly the uptake rate of [3H]acetic acid, whereas di- and tricarboxylic acids did not. The uptake of [3H]acetic acid was competitively inhibited by salicylic acid, with an inhibition constant, Ki, of 3.60 mM, suggesting a common transport system between acetic acid and salicylic acid. Moreover, at the medium pH of 7.4, salicylic acid and valproic acid inhibited significantly the uptake of [3H]acetic acid, demonstrating that the transport of MCA drugs could also be ascribed to the MCA transport system at the physiologic pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, maximally effective doses of these drugs occasioned an average of only 54 to 77% responses on the cocaine-associated lever and markedly reduced response rates.

A variety of xanthine adenosine receptor antagonists did not suppress the responses to the adenosine analog 5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. However, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and certain related xanthines inhibited antigen (dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin, DNP-BSA)-induced generation of inositol phosphates, the increase in level of free cytosolic Ca++ and exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells that were primed with a monoclonal DNP-specific immunoglobulin E (from hybridoma H1 DNP-epsilon-26.82). The same compounds inhibited the binding of antigen to cell attached DNP-specific IgE in a highly selective manner. Incorporation of an aromatic or cycloalkyl group in the 8-position of IBMX or theophylline, for example, resulted in compounds that were more potent inhibitors than the parent compounds. Conversely, substituents in the 7- or 9-position of IBMX resulted in inactive compounds. 1,3-Diethylxanthine and 1,3-dipropylxanthine had no activity, suggesting that substituents as large as ethyl or propyl are not tolerated at the 1-position. Inhibition by IBMX was not observed when cells were activated by nonimmunological stimulants or when cells were primed with certain other monoclonal preparations of DNP-specific IgE and stimulated by DNP-BSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neutrophils (1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(8) cells/10-ml organ chamber) were added to organ chambers filled with a physiological salt solution (37 degrees C; pH 7.4; 21% O2; 100 U/ml of superoxide dismutase) containing a ring or strip of an isolated tissue contracted with an appropriate contractile agent. Neutrophils caused relaxations in all vascular tissues tested, with the dog coronary artery being the most sensitive (IC50 approximately 1 x 10(5) cells), followed by the dog femoral artery, rabbit aorta and dog saphenous vein, respectively. In the rabbit fundic strip, approximately 1 x 10(7) cells were required to induce 50% relaxation, with 1 x 10(8) cells producing less than 35% relaxation in the dog, guinea pig and rat tracheas. In contrast, nitroprusside- and cromakalim-induced relaxations in all the smooth muscle tissues tested. The response to cromakalim was similar in all tissues with nitroprusside being more active in the vascular tissues. Methylene blue (1 x 10(-5) M) abolished the neutrophil induced relaxations in the rabbit aorta and dog femoral artery but had no effect on the responses to nitroprusside or cromakalim in the rabbit aorta, dog femoral artery or guinea pig trachea.

Either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist LY53857 was infused i.v. at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a constant infusion of 2 mg/kg/min beginning 5 min before left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and continuing throughout the duration of the ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Verification of functional 5HT2 receptor antagonism in the circulating blood of the LY53857-treated dogs was monitored throughout the experiments by periodic assessment of ex vivo platelet reactivity to exogenous serotonin. After 5 h of reperfusion, the hearts were excised and analyzed utilizing histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium, which demarcates myocardial infarct size and anatomical area of myocardium at risk of infarction. There was not a significant reduction of infarct size with LY53857 treatment: control infarct/area at risk = 38.6 +/- 4.7%, n = 9 LY53857 infarct/area at risk = 33.4 +/- 3.8%, n = 6. Similarly, when myocardial infarct size was analyzed as a function of myocardial collateral blood flow, there were no significant effects of drug treatment on the relationship between collateral blood flow and infarct size. The effects of 5HT on neutrophil activation were determined by measuring the potential ability of 5HT to enhance the chemotactic peptide-induced production of superoxide. 5HT did not activate human neutrophils in vitro and LY53857 had no effect on neutrophil superoxide production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The highest [125I]VIP binding was located in the P2 fraction and was correlated with the locations of maximal [3H]saxitoxin binding and VIP-immunoreactive content. This correlation indicates that VIP receptors are present on synaptosomes of canine small intestinal mucosa. A fraction enriched in synaptosomes contained a high density of saturable VIP receptors (352 +/- 26.40 fmol/mg) having high affinity (Kd, 0.23 nM) for [125I]VIP. Studies of association and dissociation of [125I]VIP to this site revealed that binding was fully reversible and yielded a Kd value similar to that from equilibrium binding. Competition binding experiments suggested the presence of two binding sites, a high and a low affinity binding site. The order of competition potency was VIP greater than peptide histidine isoleucine greater than secretin greater than peptide histidine methionine greater than or equal to [D-Ala4]VIP greater than or equal to [Phe1]VIP greater than VIP10-28 greater than [4-Cl-D-Phe6-Leu17]VIP. All these competitors displaced all specifically bound VIP. VIP, peptide histidine isoleucine and secretin interacted differentially with each of the two binding sites. Peptide histidine methionine, [D-Ala4]VIP, [Phe1]VIP, VIP10-28 and [4-Cl-D-Phe6-Leu17]VIP interacted with a single low affinity at all binding sites.

  ".W": "The binding profiles of the class I antiarrhythmic agents disopyramide, pirmenol and pentisomide (CM7857) to cardiac muscarinic receptors were characterized by the binding assay using [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS) as a ligand and their anti-muscarinic actions were investigated functionally in left atrial preparations. All the agents displaced the specific binding of 200 pM [3H]NMS from guinea pig left atrial membranes. Computer-assisted analysis indicated that pirmenol interacted with a single class of binding sites, but the displacement curves of disopyramide and pentisomide were shallow and best fitted to a two-site model. When the concentration of [3H]NMS was increased to 1 nM, the displacement curve of pirmenol was best fitted to a two-site model. In higher concentrations, these agents inhibited the dissociation of [3H]NMS initiated by 1 microM atropine in a concentration-dependent manner, thus revealing allosteric interactions. Two enantiomers of pirmenol possessed qualitatively the same binding properties as the racemate. In guinea pig left atria, disopyramide, pirmenol and pentisomide shifted the concentration-response curves for the negative inotropic effect of carbachol in a parallel manner. The slopes of Schild plot were not significantly different from unity, indicating that they act as a competitive antagonist of cardiac muscarinic receptors. Excellent correlation between the high affinity pKi values and the pA2 values was established for the antiarrhythmic agents. These findings suggest that disopyramide, pirmenol and pentisomide all interact with cardiac muscarinic receptors in both a competitive fashion and an allosteric one. The dual mode of the interaction with cardiac muscarinic receptors seems to be independent of their chiralities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The serotonin (5-HT) receptor-related compounds metergoline, pirenperone, ketanserin, cyproheptadine, pizotyline, methysergide, lysergic acid diethylamide, mianserin and cinanserin were studied in pigeons trained to discriminate l-5-hydroxytryptophan (l-5-HTP) (18.0 mg/kg) from saline and in pigeons trained to discriminate quipazine (1.0 mg/kg) from saline. Metergoline did not generalize to either quipazine or l-5-HTP but did antagonize drug-appropriate responding in both groups. Ketanserin potently blocked the quipazine discriminative stimulus and neither generalized to nor attenuated the l-5-HTP discriminative stimulus. Pirenperone, cinanserin, cyproheptadine, methylsergide, pizotyline and mianserin attenuated the quipazine discriminative stimulus at low doses and, at higher doses, generalized to the l-5-HTP discriminative stimulus. No antagonism of the l-5-HTP-discriminative stimulus or generalization to the quipazine-discriminative stimulus were observed with these compounds. A correlation coefficient of 0.93 was calculated between the potencies of 5-HT compounds to generalize to the l-5-HTP stimulus and the binding affinities of these compounds for a 5-HT1 receptor in rat brain. In addition, a correlation coefficient of 0.78 was calculated between the potencies of 5-HT compounds to attenuate the quipazine stimulus and the binding affinities of these compounds for the 5-HT2 receptor in rat brain. These observations suggest cyproheptadine, pizotyline, methysergide, lysergic acid diethylamide, mianserin and cinanserin are agonists at the 5-HT1 receptor in the l-5-HTP discrimination and antagonists at a 5-HT2 receptor in the quipazine discrimination in pigeons.\r"

  ".U": "91366748\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--The A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene has been earlier reported to occur in 69% of alcoholics, compared with 20% of controls. Other research has reported no significant difference in the prevalence of the A1 allele in alcoholics vs controls and no evidence that the DRD2 gene was linked to alcoholism. We hypothesized that these seemingly conflicting results might be because increases in the prevalence of the A1 allele may not be specific to alcoholism. Thus, we examined other disorders frequently associated with alcoholism or those believed to involve defects in dopaminergic neurotransmission. DESIGN.--Case comparison study. To minimize the effect of racial differences in gene frequencies, the study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites. SETTING.--Ambulatory and hospitalized patients. RESULTS.--Among all known controls (n = 314), 77 (24.5%) carried the A1 allele. Of the 69 controls known not to be alcoholics, 10 (14.5%) carried the A1 allele. The prevalence of the A1 allele was significantly increased in patients with Tourette's syndrome (44.9%, n = 147), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (46.2%, n = 104), autism (54.5%, n = 33), alcoholism (42.3%, n = 104), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45.7%, n = 35). After correction for multiple comparisons (requiring P less than .0009 for significance), all remained significant except posttraumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. The prevalence of the A1 allele in drug addiction and schizophrenia was only significant when compared with that of controls who were not alcoholics, and no correction was made for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION.--These results suggest the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with a number of behavior disorders in which it may act as a modifying gene rather than as the primary etiological agent.\r"

DESIGN.--We compared allele frequencies at the previously described Taq I restriction fragment length polymorphism system of DRD2 in alcoholics and random population controls. SUBJECTS.--The alcoholic subjects were 44 unrelated white individuals, diagnosed by direct structured interview to have alcohol dependence (by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, criteria). The subjects in our random population control group (N = 68) were also white. RESULTS.--For the control group, allele frequencies at DRD2 were 0.20 (A1) and 0.80 (A2). For the alcoholic group overall, allele frequencies were 0.23 (A1) and 0.77 (A2). There were no significant differences in allele frequencies at the DRD2 locus between alcoholics and controls. The allele frequencies in both groups agreed closely with those observed in most previously described control populations. Subtyping the alcoholic group according to presence or absence of family history of alcoholism, presence or absence of antisocial personality disorder, age of onset, presence or absence of physical withdrawal symptoms, or recent alcohol consumption (as a measure of severity) did not in any case reveal significant differences in allele frequencies. CONCLUSION.--We were not able to replicate the results previously reported. We conclude that our data do not support an allelic association between the A1 allele at DRD2 and alcoholism.\r"

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center at the University of South Florida, Tampa, where all patients in the case group received their diagnoses and histological confirmations. PATIENTS.--Forty consecutive women newly diagnosed with endometrial cancer and 40 controls matched for age and Quetelet index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Anthropometric measurements were taken for the abdomen, thigh, suprailiac, subscapular, biceps, and triceps skin fold thicknesses; waist and hip circumferences, weight, and height. Relative risks for endometrial cancer were calculated according to these anthropometric measurements. RESULTS.--Case patients with endometrial cancer had significantly greater waist-to-hip circumference ratios (P less than .001), abdomen-to-thigh skin fold ratios (P less than .01), and suprailiac-to-thigh skin fold ratios (P = .02) compared with control subjects matched for age and Quetelet index. The relative risk for endometrial cancer increased with an increasing waist-to-hip circumference ratio (less than or equal to 1.14 = 1.0; greater than 1.14 = 15.0), with an increasing abdomen-to-thigh skin fold ratio (less than or equal to 0.82 = 1.0; greater than 0.82 = 5.0), and with an increasing suprailiac to-thigh skin fold thickness ratio (less than or equal to 0.67 = 1.0; greater than 0.67 = 3.50). CONCLUSION.--Upper-body fat localization is a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer in women matched for age and Quetelet index.\r"

Therefore, we investigated the levels of mtDNA damage and OXPHOS transcripts in normal and ischemic hearts, and then in other forms of heart disease. DESIGN.--DNA was extracted from the heart and the levels of the common 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion were quantitated as an index for mtDNA damage. Total RNA was extracted from hearts and analyzed for OXPHOS transcript levels. RESULTS.--In control hearts, the 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion appeared at age 40 years and reached a maximum deletion of 0.0035%. Much higher levels were found in ischemic hearts (0.02% to 0.85%), as well as in three of 10 cases with other types of heart disease (0.017% to 0.16%). The OXPHOS transcripts were increased in all diseased hearts. CONCLUSION.--Ischemic hearts have increased mtDNA damage and OXPHOS gene expression, suggesting that mtDNA damage is associated with OXPHOS deficiency. Oxidative phosphorylation defects may also play a role in some other forms of cardiac disease.\r"

Both studies analyzed an area of public health concern, radiation as a risk for cancer. DESIGN.--Seven computerized on-line databases were screened for daily newspapers published in North America during the week following JAMA's publication of the two studies. These databases had full-text access to 168 daily newspapers. Newspapers identified with reports of the two studies were analyzed for length and quality of the reports. RESULTS.--Seventeen newspapers, publishing 19 reports on the two studies, were identified. Nine reports were dedicated solely to the positive study and 10 reports covered both studies. None of the reports were dedicated to the negative study only. In reports covering both studies, the mean length of the positive reports was significantly longer than the mean length of the negative reports (354 +/- 181 words vs 192 +/- 178 words; P = .04). The mean quality score of the positive reports was significantly higher than that of the negative reports (10.1 +/- 3.4 vs 5.9 +/- 4.9; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS.--The number, length, and quality of newspaper reports on the positive study were greater than news reports on the negative study, which suggests a bias against news reports of studies showing no effects or no adverse effects.\r"

  ".U": "91366869\r", 
  ".W": "In hamster ascending thin limb of Henle's loop (ATL) perfused in vitro, we examined halogen selective permeability and effects on Cl- transport. Relative permeabilities for halogens to sodium (PX/PNa) were determined by single salt dilution voltage. (PF/PNA, PCl/PNa, PBr/PNa and PI/PNa were 0.47 +/- 0.09, 3.23 +/- 0.22, 3.23 +/- 0.26, and 0.47 +/- 0.09, respectively. Simultaneous determination of 36Cl and 125I fluxes confirmed that addition of 10(-4) M 5-nitro-2-(3-phenyl-propylamino)-benzoate (NPPB), a Cl- channel blocker, to the bath decreased the flux coefficient for 36Cl (10(-7) cm2/s) from 67.0 +/- 11.7 to 29.5 +/- 7.9 without affecting that for 125I. NPPB also reduced both PCl/PNa and PBr/PNa from 2.67 +/- 0.20 to 0.95 +/- 0.12 and from 2.33 +/- 0.24 to 1.32 +/- 0.12, respectively. Addition of 100 mM Cl- or I- decreased 36Cl flux coefficient from 124.8 +/- 14.3 to 87.7 +/- 13.0 or to 41.0 +/- 11.6 without affecting that for 125I. All other halogens and SCN- also exhibited inhibitory effects on 36Cl flux. These findings support the hypothesis that the putative Cl- channel in the ATL is highly permeable to both Cl- and Br- but less permeable to I-, F-, and SCN-. They suggest that there are at least two functionally distinct components in the process of Cl- transport across the ATL, the binding site and the selective barrier. All halogens may compete against Cl- at the binding site.\r"

The route for this transepithelial Cl- movement appears to be the paracellular pathway, and the driving force is the lumen positive voltage generated by the process of electrogenic H+ secretion. Currently, there is no evidence to support the existence of a significant transcellular route for transepithelial Cl- movement. Although the primary function of the OMCDi is related to urine acidification, Cl- plays an important role in this process. The basolateral membrane of the OMCDi cell contains a band-3 related Cl-/HCO3- antiporter and a Cl- conductance. The Cl-/HCO3- antiporter serves as the primary route for the efflux of HCO3- generated during the process of H+ secretion. The Cl- conductance allows Cl- brought into the cell by the antiporter to recycle across this membrane. This conductance also serves to maintain cell charge balance. Accordingly, for each equivalent of H+ leaving the cell across the apical membrane, a Cl- equivalent exits the cell across the basolateral membrane. Based on whole-cell patch-clamp studies, this Cl- conductance is blocked by the Cl- channel blocker DPC. This conductance may also have a finite permeability to HCO3-, and thus could serve as a secondary route for cellular HCO3- efflux. Lastly, the conductance is activated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol.\r"

The effect of acidosis on the Na/H antiporter can be reproduced by preincubating cultured proximal tubule cells chronically in acid media, suggesting that low extracellular fluid pH is an important signal in acidosis. The specific extracellular signals in chronic K deficiency and chronic hyperfiltration have not been elucidated. The effect of acid preincubation on Na/H antiporter activity in cultured proximal tubule cells is dependent on protein synthesis and is associated with increased abundance of mRNA for the Na/H antiporter. The cell signalling pathways which mediate these effects have not been determined. However, the common response in chronic acidosis, chronic K deficiency, and chronic hyperfiltration to the demand for increased H transport, suggests that a common signalling pathway will be found in all these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The rat MTAL secretes protons into the tubular fluid and thus absorbs bicarbonate at substantial rates. Yet the cellular mechanisms of H+/HCO3- transport in the rat MTAL remain largely unsettled. We have performed intracellular pH recovery studies with use of the fluorescent probe BCECF in suspensions of rat MTAL fragments. Luminal H+ secretion occurs by two mechanisms (each responsible for 50% of the normal pHi recovery rate): (1) an electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter that has an Na-Km of about 11 mM and is inhibited by amiloride (Ki = 2.8 x 10(-5) M); (2) a primary H+ pump that is inhibited by 10(-4) M NEM and 10(-4) M omeprazole, but not by 10(-4) M vanadate or removal of external K. These results suggest the presence of a vacuolar H(+)-ATPase rather than a H(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Basolateral HCO3 exit occurs predominantly by a Cl(-)- and Na(+)-independent electroneutral K+/HCO3- symporter, that has an HCO3-Km of about 17 mM, and is partially inhibited by 10(-4) M DIDS. Basolateral HCO3- efflux was not accompanied by variations of membrane potential monitored with the Em-sensitive fluorescent probe DIS-C3-5, and was not affected by maneuvers that depolarize the cells. It was strongly inhibited by cellular K depletion and dependent on transmembrane K gradient. We conclude that the rat MTAL should secrete protons through both Na+/H+ antiporter and H(+)-ATPase, and that basolateral HCO3- exit should occur through an electroneutral K+/HCO3- symporter.\r"

The OMCDi cells of the rabbit appear to be ideal for studying the mechanism and regulation of proton transport in a cell which is functionally similar to the alpha intercalated cell of the cortical collecting tubule. Characterization of the specific transporters at the apical and basolateral membrane allows us to explore further the mechanism whereby hormones and their second messengers regulate net transport in these cells. Simultaneous electrophysiologic measurements and determination of intracellular ion activities with fluorescent dyes, a technique we are currently employing in studies of single alpha and beta intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubule, will be required to make progress in our study of regulation. Finally, characterization of the transporters has demonstrated that these cells are more complex than initially thought. Especially exciting is the possibility that the apical membrane proton extrusion step may be accomplished by more than one mechanism, i.e., a proton ATPase or an H(+)-K(+)-ATPase.\r"

  ".W": "Brush-border membranes from rat kidney cortex are transiently exposed to cholate to reorient ATP-driven H+ pumps to the outside of the vesicles. The carboxyl group reagent, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), inhibits ATP-driven H+ uptake into cholate-pretreated vesicles irreversibly. Complete inhibition requires treatment of vesicles with 0.2 mM DCCD for greater than or equal to 15 min. ATP and ADP do not protect the H+ pump from inactivation suggesting that DCCD modifies pump subunits involved in H+ translocation, but not those related to ATP hydrolysis. With [14C]DCCD a 16 kDa protein is strongly labeled in brush-border and endosomal membranes, but not in basolateral membranes. Molecular mass of this protein and distribution similar to H(+)-ATPases suggest a role as H(+)-conducting subunit of the H+ pumps. The SH-group reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), also inhibits ATP-driven H+ uptake irreversibly. As opposed to DCCD, ATP and ADP protect the pump from irreversible inhibition indicating that NEM modifies SH-groups in the proximity of ATP hydrolysis sites. Finally, 15 nM of a potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases, bafilomycin B1, abolishes ATP-driven H+ uptake. Inactivation by DCCD and NEM, labeling of 16 kDa subunits by [14C]DCCD, and high sensitivity to bafilomycin indicate that the H+ pump (H(+)-ATPase) in rat renal brush-border membranes belongs to the class of vacuolar ATPases. Bafilomycin may prove a valuable tool for specific inhibition of the renal H(+)-ATPase in future studies.\r"

Proton pumps in proximal-tubule epithelial cells are located in a band of apical membrane at the base of the brush border. To determine the effect of microtubule disruption on proton-pump polarity in these cell types, we immunolocalized proton pumps in normal and colchicine-treated rat kidneys. In addition, NEM-sensitive ATPase was measured in brush-border (BBMV) and basolateral membrane vesicles from kidney cortex. Rats were injected with colchicine, and kidneys were fixed 4-24 h later. In both cortical and medullary IC, proton pumps were localized on vesicles that were scattered throughout the cell. A- and B-type ICs were no longer distinguishable on the basis of proton-pump polarity. In the medulla, no concentration of proton pumps at the basolateral pole of ICs was detectable. In proximal tubules, pumps were also scattered on vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. NEM-sensitive ATPase was reduced by over 60% in BBMV, and was also reduced in basolateral membranes, indicating no increased insertion of NEM-sensitive ATPase into basolateral membranes after colchicine treatment. We conclude that a change in the polymerization state of microtubules is not sufficient to account for the differential targetting of proton pumps in subpopulations of intercalated cells.\r"

Recently, a cDNA encoding a human Na(+)-H+ exchanger of unknown tissue origin was cloned, and Northern blot analysis revealed that structurally similar transcripts were expressed in rabbit kidney and porcine renal epithelial cells (LLC-PK1). To clone these renal transcripts we employed cDNA library screening and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We obtained 2.5 kb and 1.4 kb cDNAs corresponding to the 5' untranslated region and the membrane-associated domain of a rabbit renal Na(+)-H+ exchanger. From LLC-PK1 cells we obtained 1.5 kb and 1.3 kb cDNAs encoding the membrane-associated and cytoplasmic domains. The sequences of cDNAs from these three species were very similar and suggested a high degree of evolutionary conservation. Immunolocalization of synthetic oligopeptides derived from the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the cloned cDNAs encoded the amiloride-sensitive form of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger present in basolateral membranes of epithelia. cDNAs were also used to study regulation of Na(+)-H+ exchanger gene expression in the kidney, and we found that metabolic acidosis stimulated both the transport rate and steady-state transcript levels of the basolateral Na(+)-H+ exchanger in LLC-PK1 cells.\r"

Second is a compensatory Ca2+ movement associated with an ATP-dependent H+ pump catalyzed by H(+)-ATPase in endosome. Third is a mitochondrial Ca2+ movement driven by an electrophoretic H+ driving force. All these processes must play a critical role on transfering messages between Ca2+ and H+. Data indicate that an ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump is an electroneutral Ca2+/H+ antiporter in renal tubular cells as well as in other nonrenal cells. The existence of this process is compatible with the physiological phenomena of Ca2+ and H+ transport in renal tubules, although we still lack direct evidence to comprehend the role of the Ca2+/H+ pump in the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "We have described the overall process that is responsible for the efficient transfer of ammonium from its production site in the proximal tubule cells to the final urine. The mechanism depends on direct NH4+ transport at a number of sites. There appears to be a predominance of NH3 over NH4+ transport in net total ammonia transport only in the collecting ducts and possibly the descending limbs of Henle's loop. Several examples of physiologically important direct NH4+ transport in the kidney were described. First, coupled Na/NH4/2Cl transport across the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop mediates secondary active transport of ammonium, which drives countercurrent multiplication of ammonium in the renal medulla. Second, part of the NH4+ uptake across the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb may occur as a result of penetration by NH4+ through apical K+ channels. It is unknown whether NH4+ penetrates K+ channels in other tubule segments. Third, NH4+ can be actively transported into cells by substitution of NH4+ for K+ on the Na-K-ATPase. This NH4+ transport process is likely to be rapid enough to be physiologically significant only in the inner medulla, where NH4+ concentrations are high enough to successfully compete with K+. Fourth, NH4+ penetrates the paracellular pathway in some nephron segments such as the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. Simple passive diffusion of NH4+ via the paracellular pathway is thought to be physiologically important in the thick ascending limb where it contributes to net NH4+ absorption.\r"

Frozen sections were immunostained with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the proliferation index determined using static image analysis. Pure intraductal carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma coexisting with invasive disease, and metastatic sites coexisting with primary tumors were studied. The proliferation index of pure intraductal carcinomas (mean 4.5%, median 1.8%) was not significantly different from invasive mammary cancers (mean 5.1%, median 2.2%). The proliferation index determined for the in situ component of primary cancers (mean 3.8%, median 1.5%) was not significantly different from values obtained from the invasive component of growth (mean 4.2%, median 2.1%). Variability between in situ and invasive components for individual cases was minimal in tumors whose proliferation index was less than 3.0%; for tumors with higher proliferation indices, the differences were greater. However, there was no trend toward a decrease or increase in growth fraction for the two components of primary tumor growth. The mean proliferative index for primary tumors (mean 4.9%, median 4.0%) was not significantly different from the mean proliferative score from a matched group of metastatic sites in the same patients (mean 5.7%, median 5.5%). Comparison of individual cases uncovered differences in some tumors; again no consistent trends in either direction were noted. An increase (or decrease) in growth activity does not accompany the transition from intraductal (in situ) disease to invasive mammary cancer, nor does a change in growth fraction necessarily accompany progression of mammary cancer from the primary to regional metastatic site.\r"

Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls. The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer. The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems. Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation. It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer.\r"

In 226 of 261 patients who died with metastatic disease there were 25 cases of ILC, 195 cases of IDC, 4 cases of mixed IDC-ILC, and 2 cases of mucinous carcinoma. There was no statistically significant difference in frequency of metastases to common metastatic sites, such as the liver, bone, and pleura, with the exception of the lungs, in which IDC metastases prevailed (P less than 0.006). By contrast, a statistically highly significant prevalence of ILC metastases to the peritoneum/retroperitoneum, hollow viscera, internal genital organs, leptomeninges, and myocardium was found (P values of less than 0.006- less than 10(-6). The metastases to these sites were characterized by diffuse growth of neoplastic cells that infiltrated in a lymphoma or leukemia-like fashion. Such metastases may remain clinically silent for a long time, in spite of their extensiveness. The difference of metastatic pattern between ILC and IDC is insufficiently appreciated in most of the published studies on ILC.\r"

DFMO showed a dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect against human colon tumor xenograft and lung adenocarcinoma cells. Growth-inhibitory activity of DFMO against T6 cells was reversed completely when the cells were treated simultaneously with putrescine (PU) (10(-6) M) and DFMO (10(-3) M). When 5-FU and DFMO were used in combination against T6 cells, no antagonism or synergism between the two drugs was seen. However, in the case of A549 cells, when DFMO was used in combination with DX, there was a consistent increase in growth inhibition that surpassed the inhibition of either agent given alone.\r"

Significant increases in 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival were noted as we changed from the melphalan trial, in which only 14% underwent optimal debulking surgery, to PAC-H, in which 57% and the PAC trial in which 90%, respectively, underwent optimal debulking surgery. However, for those patients whose tumors were optimally debulked in the three trials, there were no statistically significant differences in median survival, median progression-free survival, 5-year survival, or 5-year progression-free survival in those patients treated with melphalan, PAC-H, or PAC. Without optimal debulking surgery, Cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy offered a small survival advantage. These results are similar to that reported by Gruppo Interregionale Cooperativo Oncologico Ginecologia, in which survival curves were identical for all the subgroups of chemotherapy regimens for those patients with residual disease less than 2 cm at the onset of chemotherapy whether they received (1) cyclophosphamide; (2) cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin; (3) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin; (4) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and hexamethylmelamine; (5) Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide; (6) low-dose Cisplatin; (7) high-dose Cisplatin; or (8) carboplatin.\r"

Arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets and vessel walls may also contribute to the metastatic process. Several preliminary trials of platelet inhibitory agents have been performed. Ketoconazole (inhibitor of lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthetase), verapamil (calcium antagonist), forskolin (stimulator of platelet adenylate cyclase), and indomethacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) were examined, alone and in combination, to investigate their effects on platelet aggregation and on hepatic metastases from human pancreatic tumor cells (RWP-2) in nude mice. The tumor cells were injected intrasplenically, and the animals were divided into control, single-drug and combination treatment groups. The agents were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before and every 24 hr after the tumor cell injections for 6 days. Statistically significant differences were observed between the control and single-treatment groups on the reduction of liver tumor nodules (range P less than 0.001-0.032) and in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (range P less than 0.001-0.013). Furthermore, when these agents were combined, similar reductions in liver tumor nodules were noted (range P less than 0.001-0.008), while even greater inhibitory effects were seen in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (P less than 0.001) compared with the single-treatment groups. Also, the combination studies strongly inhibited RWP-2-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma.\r"

Seven patients underwent potentially curative resections and 28 patients presented with metastatic (stage IV) disease. Sixty-four patients had locally advanced and unresectable primary lesions. A total of 51 patients received I-125 seed implantation. There was no statistically significant difference in morbidity (33% vs. 30%) or mortality (6% vs. 8%) between patients receiving I-125 implantation and those undergoing palliative surgical procedures without implantation. Operative mortality was highest in patients presenting with stage IV lesions (11%). In those patients with locally advanced and unresectable carcinomas, there was a nonsignificant increase in survival (12.8 mo vs. 10.7 mo) in those receiving intraoperative I-125 implants when compared to those who did not when both groups received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. Based on these encouraging results, it is concluded that I-125 implantation can be performed safely and shows a trend toward improving long-term survivorship in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma when used in conjunction with chemotherapy and external beam radiation.\r"

In the present study, flow cytometry and several different monoclonal antibodies recognising T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell populations as well as activation and cell adhesion antigens were used to study 147 individuals with CFS. Compared with healthy controls, a reduced CD8 suppressor cell population and increased activation markers (CD38, HLA-DR) on CD8 cells were found. The differences were significant (p = 0.01) in patient with major symptoms of the disease. These immunological indices were not observed in 80 healthy individuals, in 22 contacts of CFS patients, or in 43 patients with other diseases. No correlation of these findings in CFS patients with any known human viruses could be detected by serology. The findings suggest that immune activation is associated with many cases of CFS.\r"

The abilities of psychosocial stress, somatic symptoms, and subjectively assessed cognitive impairment to predict delayed recovery from common whiplash were investigated in a follow-up study. 78 consecutive patients referred 7.2 (SD 4.5) days after they had sustained common whiplash in car accidents were assessed for psychosocial stress, negative affectivity, personality traits, somatic complaints, and cognitive impairment by semistructured interview and by several standardised tests. On examination 6 months later 57 patients were fully recovered and 21 had persisting symptoms. The groups' scores for the independent variables assessed at the baseline examination were compared. Stepwise regression analysis showed that psychosocial factors, negative affectivity, and personality traits were not significant in predicting the outcome. However, initial neck pain intensity, injury-related cognitive impairment, and age were significant factors predicting illness behaviour. This study, which was based on a random sample and which considered many other possible predictive factors as well as psychosocial status, does not support previous findings that psychosocial factors predict illness behaviour in post-trauma patients.\r"

  ".W": "From January, 1988, to March, 1989, a widespread outbreak (118 cases) of poliomyelitis type 1 occurred in Oman. Incidence of paralytic disease was highest in children younger than 2 years (87/100,000) despite an immunisation programme that recently had raised coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) among 12-month-old children from 67% to 87%. We did a case-control study (70 case-patients, 692 age-matched controls) to estimate the clinical efficacy of OPV, assessed the immunogenicity of OPV and extent of poliovirus spread by serology, retrospectively evaluated the cold chain and vaccine potency, and sought the origin of the outbreak strain by genomic sequencing. 3 doses of OPV reduced the risk of paralysis by 91%; vaccine failures could not be explained by failures in the cold chain nor on suboptimum vaccine potency. Cases and controls had virtually identical type 1 neutralising antibody profiles, suggesting that poliovirus type 1 circulation was widespread. Genomic sequencing indicated that the outbreak strain had been recently imported from South Asia and was distinguishable from isolates indigenous to the Middle East. Accumulation of enough children to sustain the outbreak seems to have been due to previous success of the immunisation programme in reducing spread of endemic strains, suboptimum efficacy of OPV, and delay in completing the primary immunisation series until 7 months of age. Additionally, the estimated attack rate of infection among children aged 9-23 months exceeded 25% in some regions, suggesting that a substantial proportion of fully vaccinated children had been involved in the chain of transmission.\r"

  ".W": "A case of infectious leprosy in residential accommodation in the UK prompted a study of the cellular and humoral response to Mycobacterium leprae in two groups of individuals who were in contact with the index case for almost a year. In the younger staff group (mean age 44 years) 23 of 30 individuals had positive Mitsuda skin tests, 25 showed lymphocyte transformation to a soluble sonciate of M leprae and 2 had slightly raised IgM antibody concentrations to the terminal disaccharide of M leprae phenolic glycolipid-1. In the older group of residents (mean age 83 years) 7 of 36 individuals were skin-test positive, 25 of 33 were positive by lymphocyte transformation, but none had raised antibody levels. When retested on two further occasions, the same 2 individuals in the younger group still had raised antibody concentrations, 1 of whom had a persistent lepromin skin-test response for over 8 months and showed a pronounced increase in lymphocyte transformation to mycobacterial antigens. The findings suggest that transmission of M leprae may have occurred in these 2 contacts, who were therefore given 6 months' chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin.\r"

The original purpose of the essential drug list was to itemise the minimum number of essential drugs. Many additions were due to a change in perception about the usefulness of a particular drug, not scientific advances.

A total absence of intact inhibitor was shown in one 10-week-old dystrophic hamster. In contrast, there was little difference in CANP inhibitor from heart between dystrophic and control hamsters at 4 weeks.

  ".W": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the scalp in man to magnetic stimulation of various skeletal muscles. The potentials consisted of several components, the earliest of which decreased in latency as the stimulated site moved rostrally, ranging from 46 msec for stimulation of the gastrocnemius, to 14 msec for stimulation of the deltoid. Experiments were performed to distinguish the mechanisms by which magnetic stimulation of the muscle was effective in evoking these cerebral potentials. For the gastrocnemius, the intensity of the magnetic stimulus needed for evoking cerebral potentials was less than that required for activating mixed or sensory nerves in proximity to the muscle belly (eg, posterior tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa, sural nerve at the ankle). Vibration of the muscle or passive lengthening of the muscle, procedures which activate muscle spindles, were accompanied by a significant attenuation of the potentials evoked by magnetic stimulation of the muscle. Anesthesia of the skin underlying the stimulating coil had no effect on the latency or amplitude of the early components of the magnetically evoked potentials, whereas electrically evoked potentials from skin electrodes were abolished. Thus, the cerebral potentials accompanying magnetic stimulation of the muscle appear to be due to activation of muscle afferents. We suggest that magnetic stimulation of muscle can provide a relatively simple method for quantifying the function of muscle afferents originating from a wide variety of skeletal musculature.\r"

While conventional electrodiagnostic criteria may localize an ulnar neuropathy to the elbow, separating retroepicondylar compression from humeroulnar arcade compression is more difficult. In 130 cadaver elbows, we examined the relationships between the medial epicondyle, flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar nerve. The humeroulnar arcade lay from 3 to 20 mm distal to the medial epicondyle, the intramuscular course of the nerve through the flexor carpi ulnaris ranged from 18 to 70 mm, and the nerve exited the flexor carpi ulnaris 28 to 69 mm distal to the medial epicondyle. In 6 specimens, dense fibrous bands bridged directly between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon proximal to the cubital tunnel proper; accessory epitrochleoanconeus muscles were present in 14 specimens: both may cause ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Anatomical variations may contribute to the difficulty in separating causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.\r"

Following a subnormal period with slowed conduction, most of the muscle fibers tested in healthy subjects showed a period of supernormal propagation velocity starting at 3 to 12 ms, with a peak between about 5 and 15 ms, a mean increase of 7%, and an approximately logarithmic decay toward 1 second. The onset of supernormality was earlier in muscle fibers from patients with muscular dystrophy and significantly delayed in those from denervated muscles. Denervated muscle fibers also had a significantly longer refractory period.\r"

The parameters of interest were resting membrane potential (RMP), qualities of the active state, the amount of alpha bungarotoxin (BUTX) binding, and chemosensitivity, as measured by the strength of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contractures. In all aspects, the changes recorded after insulin, were in the same direction as with direct stimulation, however, owing to the time limitations of in vitro testing, were smaller. It is suggested that the effects of electric shocks on denervated muscles are the result of activation of the insulin receptor, or some similar macromolecule, which appears to be sensitive to the membrane potential. The possible interrelations between acetylcholine and insulin receptors in neurotrophic control are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Measurements were done on the biceps muscles of 6 healthy volunteers to record simultaneously the surface electromyogram (EMG) and vibromyogram (VMG) by means of a piezoelectric device (accelerometer). The VMG is generated by mechanical waves due to the contraction mechanism and often measured as sound. The frequency spectrum and integrated value (IEMG and IVMG) of both signals were calculated. Both IEMG and IVMG showed a clear linear correlation with force, although at high forces, the variability of the VMG became rather high. Two series of experiments were performed to study the EMG and VMG changes in relation to changes induced by fatigue: (1) during constant force at 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and recovery; (2) for one 1 minute during declining force at MVC. The main finding was that the IVMG was related to the absolute force, irrespective of the fatigue state of the muscle. In contrast, the IEMG showed the well-known changes during fatigue, such as an increase during endurance. The spectral changes of the two measurements also showed a divergence. The spectra of the EMG shifted to lower frequencies in both fatigue protocols. In contrast, the spectra of the vibratory signal did not shift, except for several measurements at MVC. However, the shape did change to a somewhat flatter spectrum with less pronounced peaks. Possible explanations for this different behavior are discussed. It is concluded that the vibratory energy generated by the contraction mechanism is linearly related to force. Changes induced by fatigue do not alter this relationship: this contrasts with the behavior of the EMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intact muscle fibers or resealed fiber segments from 7 patients with recessive generalized myotonia were studied in vitro. All fibers had normal resting membrane potentials and normal resting [Ca2+]i several hours after removal. Contractions were characterized by slowed relaxation which was due to electrical after-activity. Often spontaneous depolarizations were recorded intracellularly. In all fibers, the steady state voltage-current relationship was abnormal, due to a reduced Cl- conductance. However, this conductance ranged from 0% to 66% of the total membrane conductance, whereas, in normal muscle, it was 80%. Theoretically, myotonic after-discharges would not appear until the Cl- conductance is below 20%. Thus, the membrane hyperexcitability must be due to another defect, at least in the preparations in which the Cl- conductance was only slightly reduced. In all patches from all patients investigated with the patch clamp technique, we observed reopenings of the Na+ channels throughout depolarizing pulses (such behavior was absent in normal muscle). If a patch was polarized to potentials less negative than the resting potential, the duration of the reopenings increased. We conclude that a combination of reduced Cl- conductance and the reopenings of Na+ channels underlie the electrical after-activity in recessive generalized myotonia.\r"

Three neuromuscular blockers, curare, flaxedil, and alpha-bungarotoxin, did not prevent mechanical myotonia of EDL and soleus muscles from the two mutants. Furthermore, electrical myotonia was demonstrated in isolated ADR muscle fibers devoid of nerve endings. We conclude that neither release nor reception of acetylcholine are important for the mechanism of myotonia in mouse mutants. The previously described suppression of myotonic aftercontractions by high concentrations of curare (Muscle & Nerve 1987;10:293-298) could not be reproduced; rather, a prolongation of aftercontractions was found. The other drugs had no significant effect on myotonic aftercontractions. Because neuromuscular transmission is not involved in human myotonias, this result supports the use of myotonic mice as a model, at least for recessive generalized myotonia (Becker).\r"

This study was designed to determine whether the occurrence of abnormal coronary vasoconstriction, detected by means of hyperventilation testing before angioplasty, influences the risk of restenosis after successful dilation. METHODS. Hyperventilation testing was performed 0 to 4 days before coronary angioplasty in 106 consecutive patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was considered present if hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia occurred during the recovery phase of the test. All patients had follow-up angiography 8 to 12 months after angioplasty. RESULTS. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was observed in 48 patients (group 1), whereas 58 patients (group 2) had either a negative response throughout the test or a positive response only during the overbreathing phase of the hyperventilation test. Angioplasty was successful in 40 patients in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Restenosis was documented in 29 patients (73 percent) in group 1 and 13 (25 percent) in group 2 (relative risk of restenosis, 2.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.28; P less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following three characteristics were independently related to the risk of restenosis (in descending order of importance): ST-segment elevation during spontaneous ischemic attacks (P less than 0.001), hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.001), and the presence of a lesion more than 10 mm long in the left anterior descending coronary artery (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease who have been selected for coronary angioplasty, the presence of hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction identifies a subgroup at high risk for restenosis.\r"

This injury may be the result of chronic glomerular hyperfiltration. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent on residual renal function and morphology in humans. METHODS. We evaluated long-term renal function in 14 patients with a solitary kidney who had undergone partial nephrectomy for renal-cell or transitional-cell carcinoma. In 12, the first kidney had been removed 2 months to 21 years previously for the same type of cancer; in 2, the other kidney was congenitally atrophic. Before surgery, no patient had clinical or histopathological evidence of primary renal disease. All 14 patients underwent partial nephrectomy to remove a localized tumor, with 25 to 75 percent of the solitary kidney being excised. They were evaluated 5 to 17 years after surgery (mean, 7.7). RESULTS. Twelve patients had stable postoperative renal function, and end-stage renal failure developed in two. There were no changes in blood pressure in any patient during follow-up. Nine patients had proteinuria, which was mild (0.15 to 0.8 g of urinary protein per day) in five. The extent of proteinuria was inversely correlated with the amount of remaining renal tissue (P = 0.0065) and directly correlated with the duration of follow-up (P = 0.0005). Four patients with moderate-to-severe proteinuria had renal biopsies, which revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in three patients and global glomerulosclerosis in one. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term renal function remains stable in most patients with a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent. These patients are, however, at increased risk for proteinuria, glomerulopathy, and progressive renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although asthma diagnosed by a physician is known to be related to serum IgE levels, it is not known whether there is a relation between the level of IgE and airway hyperresponsiveness to a methacholine challenge. The characteristics of asymptomatic persons that predispose them to airway hyperresponsiveness are also unknown. METHODS. We studied the relation between the serum total IgE level and airway hyperresponsiveness in the presence or absence of asthma and other atopic diseases in a birth cohort of children. Data from a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms, plus measurements of the serum total IgE level and airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, were obtained for 562 11-year-olds in New Zealand. RESULTS. The boys had a higher prevalence than the girls of current diagnosed asthma (13 percent vs. 6 percent), current symptoms of wheezing (22 percent vs. 15 percent), and airflow obstruction at base line (6 percent vs. 1 percent) and had a wider distribution of IgE levels, although mean IgE levels (120.8 IU per milliliter in the boys and 98.1 IU per milliliter in the girls) did not differ significantly between the sexes. The prevalence of diagnosed asthma was strongly related to the serum IgE level (P for trend less than 0.0001). No asthma was reported in children with IgE levels less than 32 IU per milliliter, whereas 36 percent of those with IgE levels greater than or equal to 1000 IU per milliliter were reported to have asthma. This relation with the serum IgE level was not explained by a concomitant diagnosis of allergic rhinitis or eczema. Airway hyperresponsiveness to a methacholine challenge also correlated very highly (P less than 0.0001) with the serum IgE level. This relation remained significant even after the exclusion of children with diagnosed asthma (P less than 0.0001) and of all children with a history of wheezing, allergic rhinitis, or eczema (P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Even in children who have been asymptomatic throughout their lives and have no history of atopic disease, airway hyperresponsiveness appears to be closely linked to an allergic diathesis, as reflected by the serum total IgE level.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Many state Medicaid programs limit the number of reimbursable medications that a patient can receive. We hypothesized that such limitations may lead to exacerbations of illness or to admissions to institutions where there are no caps on drug reimbursements. METHODS. We analyzed 36 months of Medicaid claims data from New Hampshire, which had a three-drug limit per patient for 11 of those months, and from New Jersey, which did not. The study patients in New Hampshire (n = 411) and a matched comparison cohort in New Jersey (n = 1375) were Medicaid recipients 60 years of age or older who in a base-line year had been taking three or more medications per month, including at least one maintenance drug for certain chronic diseases. Survival (defined as remaining in the community) and time-series analyses were conducted to determine the effect of the reimbursement cap on admissions to hospitals and nursing homes. RESULTS. The base-line demographic characteristics of the cohorts were nearly identical. In New Hampshire, the 35 percent decline in the use of study drugs after the cap was applied was associated with an increase in rates of admission to nursing homes; no changes were observed in the comparison cohort (RR = 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.6). There was no significantly increased risk of hospitalization. Among the patients in New Hampshire who regularly took three or more study medications at base line, the relative risk of admission to a nursing home during the period of the cap was 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.1), and the risk of hospitalization was 1.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.6). When the cap was discontinued after 11 months, the use of medications returned nearly to base-line levels, and the excess risk of admission to a nursing home ceased. In general, the patients who were admitted to nursing homes did not return to the community. CONCLUSIONS. Limiting reimbursement for effective drugs puts frail, low-income, elderly patients at increased risk of institutionalization in nursing homes and may increase Medicaid costs.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction is a serious complication with a high mortality rate, but little is known about whether its incidence or outcome has changed over time. As part of an ongoing population-based study of acute myocardial infarction, we examined trends over time in the incidence and mortality rate of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. We studied 4762 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area between 1975 and 1988. We determined the incidence of and short-term and long-term mortality due to cardiogenic shock in each of six years during this study period. RESULTS. The incidence of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction remained relatively constant, averaging 7.5 percent. Multivariate regression analysis that controlled for variables affecting incidence revealed significant though inconsistent temporal trends in the incidence of cardiogenic shock. As compared with the risk in 1975, the adjusted relative risk (with 95 percent confidence interval) was 0.83 (0.54 to 1.28) in 1978, 0.96 (0.63 to 1.48) in 1981, 0.68 (0.42 to 1.12) in 1984, 1.16 (0.70 to 1.92) in 1986, and 1.65 (0.99 to 2.77) in 1988. The overall in-hospital mortality rate among patients with cardiogenic shock was significantly higher than that among patients without this complication (77.7 percent vs. 13.5 percent, P less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality among the patients with shock did not improve between 1975 (73.7 percent) and 1988 (81.7 percent). Long-term survival during the 14-year follow-up period was significantly worse among patients who survived cardiogenic shock during hospitalization than among patients who did not have shock (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this observational, community-wide study suggest that neither the incidence nor the prognosis of cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction has improved over time. Both in-hospital and long-term survival remain poor for patients with this complication.\r"

In this study we examined the analgesic effects of the intraarticular, as compared with intravenous, administration of morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery. METHODS. In a double-blind, randomized trial, we studied 52 patients who had received one of four injections at the end of surgery. The patients in group 1 (n = 18) received 1 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; those in group 2 (n = 15), saline intraarticularly and 1 mg of morphine intravenously; those in group 3 (n = 10), 0.5 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; and those in group 4 (n = 9), 1 mg of morphine and 0.1 mg of naloxone intraarticularly and saline intravenously. The volume of the intraarticular injections was 40 ml, and that of the intravenous injections was 1 ml. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours, postoperative pain was assessed with a visual-analogue scale, a numerical-rating scale, and the McGill pain questionnaire. The need for supplemental analgesic agents, the patients' vital signs, and the occurrence of side effects were monitored. RESULTS. All pain scores were lower in group 1 than in group 2 at all times. The differences were significant (P less than 0.05) at three, four, and six hours (mean [+/- SD] visual-analogue score at six hours, 9 +/- 13 mm vs. 37 +/- 31 mm). The mean (+/- SD) consumption of supplemental analgesic medication per 24 hours was significantly lower in group 1 (36 +/- 51 mg of diclofenac and 1.2 +/- 3.4 mg of meperidine) than in group 2 (75 +/- 42 mg of diclofenac and 14 +/- 18 mg of meperidine, P less than 0.05). The visual-analogue scores in group 3 were slightly but not significantly higher than those in group 1 at all times except 6 and 24 hours after injection. The visual-analogue scores were significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1 one to four hours after injection (P less than 0.05), indicating that the analgesic effect of intraarticular morphine was reversible by naloxone. CONCLUSIONS. Low doses of intraarticular morphine can significantly reduce pain after knee surgery through an action specific to local opioid receptors that reaches its maximal effect three to six hours after injection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Helicobacter pylori are gram-negative spiral bacteria that are associated with chronic gastritis, a known precursor of gastric carcinoma. Persons at high risk for gastric carcinoma have been shown to have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS. We studied the relation of H. pylori infection and gastric carcinoma in a cohort of Japanese American men living in Hawaii. The 5908 men were enrolled and examined from 1967 to 1970. By 1989, 109 cases of pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma had been identified. The store serum of each patient with gastric carcinoma and of each matched control subject were tested for the presence of serum IgG antibody to H. pylori. RESULTS. Ninety-four percent of the men with gastric carcinoma and 76 percent of the matched control subjects had a positive test for H. pylori antibodies, for an odds ratio of 6.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 17.3). As the level of antibody to H. pylori increased, there was a progressive increase in the risk of gastric carcinoma (P for trend = 0.0009). The association was strong even for men in whom the diagnosis was made 10 or more years after the serum sample was obtained (odds ratio, 10.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 44.8). CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is strongly associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma. However, most persons infected with H. pylori will never have gastric carcinoma. Therefore, other factors that increase the risk of gastric carcinoma among persons infected with H. pylori need to be identified.\r"

  ".U": "91367231\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin is attributed to its inhibition of the enzyme prostaglandin G/H synthase, which is necessary for the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets. Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist. However, the formation of prostacyclin by vascular endothelium also requires prostaglandin G/H synthase, and prostacyclin exerts opposite effects on platelet function and vascular tone. We wanted to see whether controlled-release aspirin would affect the formation of thromboxane A2 but not prostacyclin by reducing the aspirin concentration that reaches the posthepatic circulation. METHODS. A controlled-release formulation containing 75 mg of aspirin, designed to release 10 mg per hour, was developed to inhibit prostaglandin G/H synthase in platelets in the prehepatic circulation. The effects of the controlled-release preparation on plasma levels of aspirin and salicylate, serum levels of thromboxane B2, and urinary dinor metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane B2 (measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) were compared with those of conventional immediate-release aspirin in normal volunteers. Prostacyclin release was stimulated by intravenous bradykinin. RESULTS. Steady-state inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 required two to four days and appeared slower with 75 mg of controlled-release than with the same amount of immediate-release aspirin. Maximal inhibition was achieved rapidly by adding a single loading dose of 162.5 mg of immediate-release aspirin to the regimen. Over a 28-day period, suppression of thromboxane A2 with this regimen was comparable to that with immediate-release aspirin taken either as 162.5 mg daily or as 325 mg on alternate days, despite the minimal systemic bioavailability of controlled-release aspirin. Bleeding time was prolonged to a similar degree with each of the three regimens. The five- to sixfold increase in the prostacyclin metabolite induced by bradykinin was depressed by pretreatment for four days with 75 mg of immediate-release aspirin, but not by 75 mg of controlled-release aspirin. CONCLUSIONS. Maximal inhibition of platelet thromboxane A2 production was sustained during long-term dosing with controlled-release aspirin, whereas basal prostacyclin biosynthesis fell only slightly and systemic synthesis of prostacyclin stimulated by bradykinin was preserved. Controlled-release aspirin may facilitate determination of the clinical importance of preserving prostacyclin during platelet inhibition in humans.\r"

Information that first appears in the scientific literature is frequently retransmitted in the popular press. Does popular coverage of medical research in turn amplify the effects of that research on the scientific community? METHODS. To test the hypothesis that researchers are more likely to cite papers that have been publicized in the popular press, we compared the number of references in the Science Citation Index to articles in the New England Journal of Medicine that were covered by The New York Times with the number of references to similar articles that were not covered by the Times. We also performed the comparison during a three-month period when the Times was on strike but continued to prepare an \"edition of record\" that was not distributed; doing so enabled us to address the possibility that coverage in the Times was simply a marker of the most important articles, which would therefore be cited more frequently, even without coverage in the popular press. RESULTS. Articles in the Journal that were covered by the Times received a disproportionate number of scientific citations in each of the 10 years after the Journal articles appeared. The effect was strongest in the first year after publication, when Journal articles publicized by the Times received 72.8 percent more scientific citations than control articles. This effect was not present for articles published during the strike; articles covered by the Times during this period were no more likely to be cited than those not covered. CONCLUSIONS. Coverage of medical research in the popular press amplifies the transmission of medical information from the scientific literature to the research community.\r"

  ".W": "Many invertebrates and vertebrates are sensitive to the polarization of light. The biophysical basis of invertebrate polarization sensitivity is an intrinsic dichroism, the alignment of chromophores along the photoreceptor microvilli. But such dichroism to axially propagating light is not present in vertebrate photoreceptors, whose chromophores are free to rotate in the plane of the outer-segment disc membranes, and a biophysical mechanism responsible for vertebrate polarization sensitivity has not been established. We hypothesize that the roughly elliptical cross-sectioned double-cone inner segment acts as a birefringent, polarization-sensitive dielectric waveguide, and that the double cone mosaic generates a 'polarization contrast' neural image. Here we confirm three predictions derived from these hypotheses: (1) 90 degrees periodicity for polarization sensitivity; (2) polarization sensitivity maxima corresponding to the absolute orientation of the axes of the double-cone inner-segment cross-sections; and (3) action spectrum for polarization sensitivity corresponding to the absorption spectrum of the double cones. We also present evidence for a polarization-opponent neural encoding in vertebrates.\r"

Peptide is critical in class I heavy-chain folding and/or stable association with beta 2-microglobulin. Although data exist suggesting a relationship between class II structure and peptide association, no equivalent positive contribution of peptide to the folding state or stability of class II dimers has yet been demonstrated. We report here that most purified E alpha k E beta k molecules leaving low pH in the absence of specific peptide lack a compact, stable dimeric structure. Brief exposure to the appropriate peptide just before and during neutralization promotes this specific conformation in proportion to stably bound peptide, indicating that peptide is important in determining class II MHC structure. Our results also indicate that efficient generation of long-lived peptide-class II complexes involves two stages: initial peptide binding in an acidic environment, which enhances the ability of class II to enter a conformation, from which stabilization upon neutralization results in high-affinity binding of previously associated peptide.\r"

  ".U": "91367262\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclins are regulatory subunits which associate with kinases to form complexes that control many of the important steps in cell-cycle progression. The best characterized of the cyclin-containing complexes is the association of cyclin B with the p34cdc2 kinase. The p34cdc2/cyclin B complex is required for the G2 to M transition (see refs 1-4 for review), but the physiological role of other cyclin complexes is unclear. Human cyclin A binds independently to two kinases, associating with either p34cdc2 or a related protein, p33 (refs 5-7). In adenovirus-transformed cells, the viral E1A oncoprotein seems to associate with p33/cyclin A but not with p34cdc2/cyclin A (B. Faha, M.M., L-H.T. and E.H., manuscript submitted). To isolate the gene for p33, we have cloned several novel human cdc2-related genes. The protein product of one of these genes, cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2), shares 65% sequence identity with p34cdc2 (ref. 8) and 89% identity with the Xenopus Eg-1 gene product. Immunochemical characterization and partial proteolytic mapping show that the cdk2 gene product is the cyclin A-associated p33. Immunoprecipitations of the p33cdk2 protein suggest that it can act as a protein kinase in vitro. As p33cdk2 is bound to cyclin A and is targeted by the viral E1A protein, we suggest that the p33cdk2/cyclin A complex has a unique role in cell-cycle regulation of vertebrate cells.\r"

  ".W": "T cells express T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) for the recognition of antigen in conjunction with the products of the major histocompatibility complex. They also express two key surface coreceptors, CD4 and CD8, which are involved in the interaction with their ligands. As CD4 is expressed on the early haemopoietic progenitor as well as the early thymic precursor cells, a role for CD4 in haemopoiesis and T-cell development is implicated. Thymocytes undergo a series of differentiation and selection steps to become mature CD4+8- or CD4-8+ (single positive) T cells. Studies of the role of CD4+ T cells in vivo have been based on adoptive transfer of selected or depleted lymphocytes, or in vivo treatment of thymectomized mice with monoclonal antibodies causing depletion of CD4+ T cells. In order to study the role of the CD4 molecule in the development and function of lymphocytes, we have disrupted the CD4 gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. Germ-line transmission of the mutation produces mutant mouse strains that do not express CD4 on the cell surface. In these mice, the development of CD8+ T cells and myeloid components is unaltered, indicating that expression of CD4 on progenitor cells and CD4+ CD8+ (double positive) thymocytes is not obligatory. Here we report that these mice have markedly decreased helper cell activity for antibody responses, although cytotoxic T-cell activity against viruses is in the normal range. This differential requirement for CD4+ helper T cells is important to our understanding of immune disorders including AIDS, in which CD4+ cells are reduced or absent.\r"

  ".W": "Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous.\r"

Nine of these patients were also tested with identically appearing placebo. Thirteen of the 17 patients (76%) given 4-AP showed clinically important motor and visual improvements compared with three of nine in the placebo group. Average peak improvement scores were 0.40 for 4-AP and 0.12 for placebo. Seventy percent of the daily 4-AP improvements lasted 7 to 10 hours. The improvements for two consecutive doses of 4-AP lasted a mean of 7.07 hours (83% of the average 8.53-hour treatment-observation period) compared with 2.36 hours for placebo (26% of the average 9.06-hour treatment-observation period).

Five patients had complete suppression, and two had significant suppression of Gd enhancement following treatment. In addition, six of seven patients had Gd-enhancing lesions that explained their clinical signs; in five of six of these patients, suppression of the Gd-enhanced lesions temporally correlated with clinical improvement.

The EMG showed abundant brief motor units with numerous fibrillations. Dystrophic features without vacuoles were best seen in the biceps femoris muscle. Asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation was present years prior to the development of weakness. The disorder appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

Oligoclonal IgA and IgM bands were mainly detected in CSF samples from patients with active neuro-Behcet's disease and were documented to disappear when neurologic manifestations remit. Oligoclonal IgG bands, however, were not related to disease activity and were also found in some neurologic controls. High immunoglobulin index values were detected in both active and quiescent diseases and were high in some patients with impaired blood-CSF barriers. The study presented here demonstrates that CSF oligoclonal IgA and IgM may be helpful in monitoring CNS disease activity in neuro-Behcet's and could be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Immunocytochemistry with antibodies to ubiquitin is currently the most sensitive method for detecting cortical Lewy bodies, which are a sine qua non for the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), an increasingly recognized form of primary degenerative dementia. In the systematic application of ubiquitin immunocytochemistry to sections of hippocampus from control subjects and patients with a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, we noted the frequent occurrence of ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites in the CA2-3 region in DLBD. The nature of these neurites was investigated with immunocytochemistry in DLBD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), normal elderly subjects, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the number of neurites varied from case to case, they were virtually always detected in DLBD but not in normal, AD, or PD brains. Double immunolabeling studies with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated a small fraction of double-stained neurites with antibodies to neurofilament or Alz-50, but no double staining with an antibody to Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. These results are different from those for neurites in AD, which are rarely seen in CA2-3 and which are immunoreactive with all these antibodies. Neuritic degeneration in the CA2-3 region of the hippocampus appears to be a specific histopathologic feature of DLBD.\r"

We have investigated the possibility of allelic variation among some forms of SMA and hexosaminidase deficiency. Recombination between the Hex B and SMA loci eliminates this enzyme as a candidate site for defects causing the illness. Furthermore, we show that, despite previous evidence to the contrary, the GM2-activator locus does not map to chromosome 5, thereby eliminating it as a candidate gene for SMA.\r"

Among 14,352 twin pairs contained in the Virginia and Norwegian twin panels for whom questionnaire information was available, there was a history of epilepsy in one or both members of 286 pairs; febrile seizures were reported in 257 pairs. Analyses of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences in concordance rates between Virginian and Norwegian twins for either epilepsy or febrile seizures. Probandwise concordance rates for epilepsy were 0.19 in monozygotic twins and 0.07 in dizygotic twins. Analogous rates for febrile seizures were 0.33 (monozygotic) and 0.11 (dizygotic). These results provide further evidence that genetic factors do have a role in the expression of epilepsy and febrile seizures.\r"

This increase was not attributable to pupil size or retinal image distortion, but probably reflects neurodegeneration in the primary visual pathway. We compared the motion sensitivity of patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) with results from a subset of the visual normals of similar age. In SDAT patients, there were significant threshold elevations, which were more pronounced in the patients with more severe dementia. These findings confirm previous reports of visual system involvement in SDAT and indicate motion testing may reveal preclinical visual system involvement in SDAT.\r"

Threshold for biceps on each side was significantly higher than ADM, but there was no side-to-side difference. Assessing handedness using a standard handedness index, those who had less tendency to use the right hand for everyday tasks had greater differences between hemispheres for ADM thresholds. The lower threshold of the left-hemisphere projection to hand muscles is probably related to the asymmetry of corticomotoneuronal monosynaptic connections; a greater number project to the motor neuron pool of the right- than left-hand muscles.\r"

The results for serum and urine show that VPA induced a significant increase in renal clearance of acylcarnitine without affecting that of free carnitine, whereas CBZ, PHT, and PHB significant increased clearance of free carnitine but not that of acylcarnitine. Thus, VPA appears to reduce tubular resorption of acylcarnitine, and CBZ, PHT, and PHB appear to reduce tubular resorption of free carnitine.\r"

We selected patients who did not have tremor but had predominant rigidity with asymmetric body involvement. On the rigid side of the PD patients, the threshold to cortical stimulation was lower than on the contralateral side or than normal values. On average, patients had normal central conduction times, but their motor evoked potentials (MEPs) on the rigid side were larger than those of controls when the cortical stimulus was at rest or during slight tonic contraction of the target muscle. In the latter condition, a silent period shorter than that of controls followed MEPs, whereas the peripheral silent period following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist was prolonged. Alpha motor neuron excitability, tested by the F-wave method, was enhanced on the rigid side at rest. In rigidity, spinal motor nuclei may be more responsive than normal to descending inputs from motor cortex, or the entire corticomotoneuron system may prove hyperexcitable under given conditions.\r"

To help clarify the extent to which M-6-G may cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to measure the concentrations of M-6-G and morphine in the plasma and either ventricular (three patients) or lumbar (eight patients) CSF of cancer patients receiving chronic morphine therapy. The mean ratio of morphine in ventricular CSF:morphine in plasma was 0.71; the same ratio for M-6-G was only 0.077. The average molar ratio of M-6-G: morphine in ventricular CSF was 0.207, and the average molar ratio in plasma was 1.89. Although sampling problems render the lumbar CSF results less reliable, they were very similar. Thus, plasma contained approximately twice as much M-6-G as morphine, whereas CSF contained only one-fifth to one-third as much. These data confirm that M-6-G in plasma is distributed into CSF, but to a far lesser extent than morphine. They help explain animal data demonstrating much higher potency of M-6-G on administration into CSF than systemic administration and indicate that the degree to which M-6-G contributes to morphine effects in humans remains an unresolved question.\r"

Equally compelling is the evidence that its accumulation in the brain causes the neuropathology characteristic of scrapie. We measured the regional concentration of PrPSc in nine brain regions throughout the course of scrapie in the Syrian hamster following intrathalamic inoculation of prions. PrPSc was compared to the regional concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a measure of reactive astrocytic gliosis. PrPSc was detected first in the thalamus 14 to 21 days postinoculation and next in the septum at 28 days. Initiation of PrPSc synthesis and accumulation in the thalamus was attributable to the inoculum and in the septum to ventricular spread of de novo synthesized PrPSc. The timing and pattern of PrPSc accumulation in all other brain regions suggested transmission along neuroanatomic pathways. Reactive astrocytic gliosis followed PrPSc accumulation in each region by 1 to 2 weeks. Brain PrPSc, determined by summing the concentrations in each brain region, correlated well with scrapie infectivity titers throughout the course of infection (correlation coefficient = 0.975; slope of linear regression line = 1.136). Our results support the hypothesis that PrPSc participates in both the etiology and pathogenesis of prion diseases.\r"

We identified five male patients with an abnormal dystrophin pattern diagnostic of Becker muscular dystrophy, and two female patients with dystrophin patterns consistent with a manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy diagnosis. Thus, 17% of our limb-girdle patients showed a dystrophinopathy, indicating that they in fact had a disorder related to Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy. Misclassification of isolated male limb-girdle patients was 31% (4/13), while misclassification of isolated female limb-girdle patients was 13% (2/15). Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction analyses of small amounts of muscle biopsy DNA confirmed a dystrophin gene deletion in all five male Becker dystrophy patients identified. This study emphasizes the clinical overlap between limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and dystrophinopathies, and reinforces the necessity of dystrophin protein and gene studies for the accurate clinical diagnosis of isolated cases of muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "To better define the pathogenic mechanisms in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the morphology and electrophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in anconeus muscle biopsy specimens from eight patients with MG and seven control subjects. There were inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junction in seven of the eight biopsies from MG patients. The endplate index (length of the postsynaptic membrane divided by the length of the apposed presynaptic membrane) was abnormally reduced in all the MG patients, and fiber type grouping, suggestive of reinnervation, was present in six of the eight MG patients. Intracellular recording revealed diminished amplitude of miniature endplate potentials and miniature endplate currents in the MG patients compared with the controls. The time constant of decay of miniature endplate currents did not differ from that of controls, suggesting no change in mean channel open time of the acetylcholine receptor. The endplate receptor sensitivity to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine was also decreased in MG patients compared with controls. The quantal content of neurally evoked endplate potentials was reduced in six of the eight MG patients, demonstrating abnormal presynaptic function as well. The presence of inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junctions of limb muscles in MG reconciles an apparent disparity between the animal model of MG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and the human disease. This study also demonstrates a frequent presynaptic component to the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in MG.\r"

We found that the motoneuron pools of homologous left and right hand muscles received common synaptic input from abnormally branched presynaptic axons. The results of electromagnetic brain stimulation, cutaneomuscular, and tendon reflex testing suggested that these common inputs are provided by abnormally branched corticospinal tract fibers whose origin is the undamaged motor cortex.\r"

  ".W": "The first operated eyes of 435 patients undergoing radial keratotomy in the Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy (PERK) study were evaluated by photokeratography to document the preoperative and postoperative corneal shape. We determined by regression analysis and analysis of variance that the corneal shape preoperatively improved the prediction of the corneal shape 6 months postoperatively in the 3-mm-clear-zone population. The reduction of myopia in all 435 eyes ranged from 1.25 to 9.75 diopters. We studied the effect of the preoperative corneal shape on this variability in the outcome of the surgery using rings 2 and 7 on photokeratography and corneal diameter. In the 3-mm-clear-zone group, eyes with flat prolate corneas had a greater reduction in myopia (4.65 D); those with steeper, more spherical corneas had less reduction in myopia (3.48 D). In addition, eyes with a 3-mm clear zone and flat central corneas alone (8.0 mm = 42.19 D) flattened approximately 0.75 D more than those with steep central corneas (7.0 mm = 48.21 D). In the 3.5-mm and 4.0-mm clear zone groups, the change in corneal curvature was not related to the preoperative curvature. A stepwise regression analysis of the 151 eyes in the 3.0-mm-clear-zone population demonstrated the following predictive equation for radial keratotomy; change in cycloplegic refraction = -14.55 + [-2.097 x average ring-2 radius] + [3.605 x average ring-7 radius] + [0.69 x horizontal corneal diameter] + [0.079 x age] + [-0.379 x spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction]. There was a 1.17-D observed difference in the effect of radial keratotomy between those eyes with a steep/steep corneal topography (7.2% of the 3.0-mm-clear-zone population) and the flat/flat topography (29% of the 3.0-mm-clear-zone PERK population). A knowledge of corneal topography provides an additional tool for understanding the operative variability of radial keratotomy.\r"
