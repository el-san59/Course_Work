  ".W": "Tumor invasion of the carotid artery is a potential indication for brachytherapy, which delivers a high dose of irradiation to residual tumor while limiting the dose to adjacent healthy tissues. The tolerance of carotid-sheath contents to varying doses of brachytherapy, however, has not been clearly established. In order to evaluate brachytherapy effects on carotid-sheath contents, after-loading catheters were implanted bilaterally in 3 groups of 6 rabbits each (18 rabbits). Iridium 192 brachytherapy doses of either 5000 cGy (rad), 9000 cGy, or 13,000 cGy were delivered unilaterally, with the contralateral neck serving as a nonirradiated control in each animal. There were no carotid ruptures and wound healing was normal. Two animals from each group were killed at 6, 20, and 48 weeks. Even at the highest dose (13,000 cGy), nerve conduction studies performed on the vagus nerve prior to sacrifice revealed no increased latency, histologic changes were minimal, and carotid arteries were patent. These observations suggest that the carotid-sheath contents in healthy rabbits could tolerate high doses (up to 13,000 cGy) of low-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy without complications.\r"

While the illness is often associated with a characteristic rash, erythema migrans, patients may also present with a variety of complaints in the absence of the rash. The otolaryngologist may be called upon to see both groups of patients, with any number of signs and symptoms referable to the head and neck, including headache, neck pain, odynophagia, cranial nerve palsy, head and neck dysesthesia, otalgia, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, temporomandibular pain, lymphadenopathy, and dysgeusia. We review our institutional experience with 266 patients with Lyme disease, 75% of whom experienced head and neck symptoms. We also summarize the diagnostic and treatment modalities for this illness.\r"

Seventy-two infants and children under age 16 with a normal chest radiogram have now been evaluated for chronic cough persisting for longer than 4 weeks. Cough-variant asthma was the most common cause of cough, followed by sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, aberrant innominate artery, psychogenic cough, and subglottic stenosis. Chronic cough is best managed by first following an individualized diagnostic protocol designed to determine the etiology of the cough. This is followed by specific therapy to treat the underlying disorder. Children with persistent cough and normal chest radiograph are best served when referred promptly for evaluation by an otolaryngologist when the primary physician's initial efforts at diagnosis and treatment are not effective. Endoscopy is underutilized in practice and its importance understated in the literature. It is particularly helpful in establishing a precise diagnosis in infants under 18 months of age.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-one children with congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear seen from 1978 through 1989 are reviewed. The most common presentation was that of an asymptomatic white mass behind a normal intact tympanic membrane. Computed tomography (CT) scan was useful in documenting extension beyond the mesotympanum. Surgical removal was performed using an extended tympanotomy for lesions in the middle ear and tympanomastoidectomy for those that had extended into attic and mastoid air cells. Observation over an average 3.1-year period indicated that 80% of children were free of disease after initial surgery. Residual disease that required further surgery was present in 20%. The importance of early diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma is strongly advocated. The prognosis is better when the cholesteatoma is confined to the anterosuperior quadrant of the middle ear. Seventeen patients in this study had such a lesion, and extended tympanotomy allowed removal of an encapsulated closed cholesteatoma with normal postoperative hearing and no residual cholesteatoma. The average age was 2.3 years. Temporal bone histopathological studies of three cases of congenital cholesteatoma demonstrate two distinct pathological types of congenital cholesteatoma. A \"closed\" keratotic cyst in the anterior mesotympanum, which is easily removed, and an \"open\" infiltrative type in which there is no containment of the keratotic debris and the cholesteatoma matrix is in direct continuity with middle ear mucosa. Surgical extirpation of the \"open\" type is difficult and more likely to be associated with residual disease.\r"

In 97% of these patients, hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates was found by acoustic rhinometry, while increased nasal resistance of various degrees was measured in 93% of all patients by active anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated that the most resistive segment was located in the anterior parts of the nasal cavity and was built up by two compartments: the region of the isthmus nasi and the region of the head of the inferior turbinate. In our snoring patients, the cross-sectional areas at the head of the inferior turbinate were always smaller than the cross-sectional areas in the isthmus nasi, which in normal controls presented the minimal cross-sectional values of the whole nasal cavity. While rhino-manometry can only measure the amount of nasal resistance, acoustic rhinometry can clearly determine the exact size and location of the different stenoses in the nasal cavity that contribute to the increased nasal resistance.\r"

Histological studies showed that tissue superficial and deep to the fascia is frequently involved with the infectious inflammatory process, even in early stages of the disease. These pathologic changes were also found in healthy-appearing tissues at the periphery of the lesions. The early recognition of the disease and the prompt and aggressive surgical and medical therapeutic approach have resulted in far lower mortality rates (7%) than those reported in the literature. Frozen-section examination contributed to the maximal eradication of the pathologic process. This successful outcome was achieved in spite of the adverse associated clinical conditions, such as old age, debilitating disease, or complications, observed in half of the patients.\r"

In a serological follow-up study, 17 (85%) of 20 patients showed a correlation on the change of antibody levels to EBNA2 and clinical progression.

The toxin or saline was injected into each thyroarytenoid muscle under electromyographic and laryngoscopic guidance. Botulinum toxin A markedly reduced perturbation, decreased fundamental frequency range, and improved the spectrographic characteristics of the voice. Fundamental frequency and phonation time remained unchanged. Patients injected with botulinum toxin A noticed significant improvement in their voices in comparison with the placebo-treated group. Excessive breathiness of the voice occurred in two patients, and mild bleeding in one patient in the botulinum toxin A-treated group. Injection with saline resulted in edema of the vocal cord in one patient. Botulinum toxin A proved to be an effective and safe treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia.\r"

The results of Bekesy audiometry, auditory brainstem response, and electrocochleography in the patients were also suggestive of brainstem pathology. Surgical records revealed that all of them had excessively short perforating arteries surrounding the entry zone of nerves VII and VIII, so that they had to be stretched during surgery. Occlusion of perforating arteries is suspected to have caused lateral brainstem infarction around the entry zone of nerves VII and VIII, and resulted in low-frequency SNHL.\r"

IgG+ and IgM+ T cells were present at all time points, with IgA+ lymphocytes forming the majority of mucosal immunoglobulin-bearing cells at 2 weeks. The cochlear scala tympani contained Lyt-1+ and Mac-1+ cells and two endolymphatic sacs stained diffusely with anti-IgA and -IgG antibodies. Lyt-1/L3T4+ T lymphocytes greatly outnumbered B lymphocytes, suggesting that helper/inducer T cells play a more important role in acute otitis media than has been recognized.

There has been a yearly increase in the total number of cases of airway foreign bodies removed in our hospital. Fifty-eight percent of the children presenting were from the countryside; 42% were townspeople. Approximately 90% of the patients were under 3 years of age, with the peak incidence of foreign body inhalation occurring between 1 and 2 years of age (57.8%). The male-female ratio was about 1.2:1. About 95% of the removed foreign bodies were organic in origin. The majority of the foreign bodies were found most often in the right bronchial tree (46%). A positive history of foreign body inhalation was obtained in 98% of the cases. Twenty-eight percent of the children presented at the hospital within 24 hours, 71% within 1 week, and 29% more than 1 week after inhaling the foreign body. The most common presenting symptoms of laryngotracheal foreign bodies were cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and hoarseness; those of bronchial foreign bodies were cough, wheezing, decreased air entry, and rhonchi. More than two-thirds of the children with larygotracheal foreign bodies had normal x-ray findings. The most common fluoroscopic findings in those children with bronchial foreign bodies were mediastinal shift (36.8%), obstructive emphysema (35.7%), and normal findings (35%). A total of 348 (87%) bronchial foreign bodies were removed by rigid bronchoscopy (81%), rod-lens bronchoscopy (5%), and spontaneous expulsion (1%); 52 (13%) laryngeal and tracheal foreign bodies were removed by direct laryngoscopy (12%) and tracheotomy (1%). A single endoscopic procedure successfully removed 92.5% of 400 foreign bodies detected in the airways. One child died during bronchoscopy, for a mortality rate of 0.25%.\r"

In normal ears, endolymphatic pressure always approximated perilymphatic pressure. Endolymphatic pressure exceeded perilymphatic pressure in all ears with hydrops, except one in which these pressures were equal. The effect of postural inversion on inner ear pressures were studied in both normal and hydropic inner ears. Normal ears showed endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure to rise equally during this maneuver. In hydropic ears, the difference between endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure was notably reduced from measurements obtained in the prone position. This study indicates that an alteration in pressure regulation within the inner ear may be important in the pathogenesis and manifestation of experimental endolymphatic hydrops in the guinea pig. Physiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of these results are described.\r"

Sixty-four cases have been treated and evaluated prospectively using this technique. Fifty-three of the patients had the soft-tissue defect restored with a myocutaneous flap, 8 had a free cutaneous tissue flap, 2 were reconstructed with tongue flaps, and 1 closed primarily. The stainless steel plate of the A.O. type was used in 53 cases and the titanium plate system and hollow screws in the other 11 cases. A success rate of 78.9% was found with a median follow-up of 384 days. Thirty of the 64 cases had preoperative irradiation and 15 were treated postoperatively. A plate failure rate of 23% was encountered in those treated with preoperative irradiation and in 20% with those having postoperative irradiation. Forty-nine of the 64 patients or 76.5% experienced no perioperative complications. Five or 7.8% of the complications were minor. Ten patients or 15.6% experienced a major complication with one death due to a myocardial infarct. A radiation dosimetric model was employed using both stainless steel and titanium. The results from this study showed that, when using a parallel pair of beams, an excess dose of irradiation for the lowest energy cobalt-60 is 13%, for 6 mV it is 15%, and for 18 mV it is 20%. The excess tissue dose, both for stainless steel and titanium plates, extends for about 0.2 mm for cobalt-60, 1.1 mm at 6 mV, and for 25 mm at 18 mV. Patients with plates, therefore, can be treated safely with postoperative irradiation using either cobalt-60 or 6-mV energy.\r"

Over several years, evidence has accumulated to suggest that primary diseases of skeletal muscle, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, may be susceptible to this approach. This review makes a critical examination of such background evidence, and also of more recent data directly addressing the concept of therapy by means of grafts of normal myogenic cells. It is concluded that the data establish the principle that such grafts effect an alteration of the genetic constitution and phenotype of skeletal muscle and, therefore, might be used to alleviate recessively inherited myopathies. Several obstacles to the therapeutic application of this method to human disease are also identified; these seem to be problems of a technical nature rather than of basic principle, and none appears insuperable.\r"

Epitopes of the 72 kD heat shock protein were expressed in the areas of abnormality in this case and in a case of hypokalemic periodic paralysis with tubular aggregates.

While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality.\r"

In almost every case the percentage of motor fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was greatest in EDB fibers. Conversely, the percentage of conduction block was greatest in the AL motor fibers. As clinical recovery is dependent on AL muscles rather than EDB, electrophysiological study of the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked fibers in the former should provide a more reliable measure of outcome than similar studies of EDB. Conduction velocity distal to the fibular head was not slowed despite the large loss of EDB motor fibers. Evidence for selective involvement of the larger myelinated fibers is, therefore, lacking. The location of the major conduction abnormalities was in almost every case between the mid-fibular head and popliteal fossa.\r"

The low acid alpha-glucosidase activity and glycogenosomes in this clone corresponded to AMD. This clone, in spite of loading glycogenososmes, was competent not only as to proliferation without contact inhibition but also as to myogenic differentiation to some extent. Dexamethasone promoted the formation by the transformant of multinucleated myotubes, which expressed acetylcholine receptors. The existence of glycogenosomes did not seem to affect the proliferation or differentiation of myoblasts. The aberrant acid alpha-glucosidase expressed in the transformed myogenic clone was shown to be biochemically identical to that in AMD fibroblasts. This transformant should be of great value for investigating the pathogenesis of AMD because of the possibility of supplying semi-permanently a uniform myogenic cell line expressing AMD.\r"

With stimulation of all 3 nerves, the propagation velocity along the spine was nonlinear: it was faster over cauda equina and midthoracic cord than over caudal spinal cord. Over the mid-thoracic cord, TN-K SSEP propagation was faster than that of TN-A and SN-A SSEPs, whereas over the caudal spinal cord these values were similar on stimulation of all 3 nerves. These data suggest that fast conducting second order afferent fiber systems contribute to spinal cord SSEPs evoked by stimulating both mixed and cutaneous peripheral nerves.\r"

At birth, muscle fiber number was found to be reduced by 26% in the biceps brachii but was unaltered in the soleus muscle. An examination of the muscles at ages through gestation revealed that any reduction in fiber number was associated with a reduction in the secondary/primary fiber ratio. There was a stage in soleus myogenesis at which fiber number was significantly lower than the control. The deficit was corrected by the continuation of secondary fiber hyperplasia beyond the time of usual cessation. A similar delay was found in the biceps brachii but it did not enable recovery to a full complement of fibers. The difference between the 2 muscles was thought to be related to the relative proportions of primary fibers in the muscles, primary fiber development being apparently unaffected by undernutrition in utero.\r"

DD of the right EDL was produced at the age approximating the onset of dystrophy in the mdx model, and mice recovered for 2 weeks. Contralateral unoperated EDLs from mdx and control mice served as internal controls for histopathology, myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and ultrastructure of fiber regeneration in DD-EDL. Mdx DD-EDL were composed of small, uniformly mature myofibers with mostly peripheral nuclei. This contrasted with control DD-EDL in which fibers were centrally nucleated. In addition, the unoperated mdx EDL exhibited the central nucleation of spontaneous recovery from dystrophy. The CSA distribution of mdx DD-EDL myofibers was significantly shifted toward smaller CSA compared with unoperated mdx EDL, although mean CSA did not differ between the two mdx muscle groups. The CSA distribution of control DD-EDL was significantly different and shifted toward smaller CSA from both unoperated control EDL and from mdx DD-EDL distributions. Ultrastructural features of dystrophy were present in both mdx DD-EDL and in the unoperated mdx EDL, although they appeared more prevalent in the latter. These results suggest that short-term plasticity of mdx muscle recovery from imposed injury may be greater than that of normal muscle in establishing a regenerating fiber population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Spinal-cord injury is devastating; until recently, there was no medical treatment to improve recovery of the initial neurologic deficit. Studies in animals have shown that monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM-1) ganglioside enhances the functional recovery of damaged neurons. METHODS. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of GM-1 ganglioside was conducted in patients with spinal-cord injuries. Of 37 patients entered into the study, 34 (23 with cervical injuries and 11 with thoracic injuries) completed the test-drug protocol (100 mg of GM-1 sodium salt or placebo intravenously per day for 18 to 32 doses, with the first dose taken within 72 hours of the injury) and a one-year follow-up period. Neurologic recovery was assessed with the Frankel scale (comprising five categories) and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score (a scale of scores from 0 to 100, derived from strength tests of 20 specific muscles, each scored from 0 to 5). RESULTS. There was a significant difference between groups in the distribution of improvement of Frankel grades from base line to the one-year follow-up (improvement of 0, 1, 2, and 3 grades in 13, 4, 1, and 0 patients, respectively, in the placebo group and 8, 1, 6, and 1 patients, respectively, in the GM-1 group; P = 0.034 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). The GM-1-treated patients also had a significantly greater mean improvement in ASIA motor score from base line to the one-year follow-up than the placebo-treated patients (36.9 vs. 21.6 points; P = 0.047 by analysis of covariance with the base-line ASIA motor score as the covariate). An analysis of individual muscle recoveries revealed that the increased recovery in the GM-1 group was attributable to initially paralyzed muscles that regained useful motor strength rather than to strengthening of paretic muscles. CONCLUSIONS. This small study provides evidence that GM-1 enhances the recovery of neurologic function after one year. A larger study must be conducted, however, before GM-1 is considered efficacious and safe in treating spinal-cord injury.\r"

In this study we examined the associations between variability in body weight and health end points in subjects participating in the Framingham Heart Study, which involves follow-up examinations every two years after entry. METHODS. The degree of variability of body weight was expressed as the coefficient of variation of each subject's measured body-mass-index values at the first eight biennial examinations during the study and on their recalled weight at 25 years of age. Using the 32-year follow-up data, we analyzed total mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, and morbidity due to coronary heart disease and cancer in relation to intraindividual variation in body weight, including only end points that occurred after the 10th biennial examination. We used age-adjusted proportional-hazards regression for the data analysis. RESULTS. Subjects with highly variable body weights had increased total mortality (P = 0.005 for men, P = 0.01 for women), mortality from coronary heart disease (P = 0.009 for men, P = 0.009 for women), and morbidity due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.0009 for men, P = 0.006 for women). Using a multivariate analysis that also controlled for obesity, trends in weight over time, and five indicators of cardiovascular risk, we found that the positive associations between fluctuations in body weight and end points related to mortality and coronary heart disease could not be attributed to these potential confounding factors. The relative risks of these end points in subjects whose weight varied substantially, as compared with those whose weight was relatively stable, ranged from 1.27 to 1.93. CONCLUSIONS. Fluctuations in body weight may have negative health consequences, independent of obesity and the trend of body weight over time.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Infants are at risk for both the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and accidental suffocation. On postmortem examination, however, it is difficult to distinguish one from the other without information from the scene of death. Healthy infants are assumed to be able to turn their heads and, if not otherwise restrained, to obtain fresh air. We assessed this assumption in an investigation of infant deaths that occurred during sleep on cushions filled with polystyrene beads. METHODS. We obtained data on 25 deaths from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also used mechanical and animal models to study physiologic aspects of ventilation relevant to these results, by simulating the effects on an infant of breathing into a cushion. We measured the effects of softness, malleability (molding of the cushion about an infant's head), airflow resistance, and rebreathing of expired gases. RESULTS. All 25 study infants were prone when found dead, and at least 88 percent were face down with nose and mouth obstructed by the cushion. SIDS was the diagnosis in 19 of the 23 infants who underwent autopsy. Our findings show, however, that the cushion would have limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the amount of rebreathing we estimated to have occurred in the infants was lethal in a rabbit model. CONCLUSIONS. Accidental suffocation by rebreathing was the most likely cause of death in most of the 25 infants studied. Consequently, there is a need to reassess the cause of death in the 28 to 52 percent of the victims of SIDS who are found with their faces straight down. Safety regulations setting standards for softness, malleability, and the potential for rebreathing are needed for infant bedding.\r"

Most physiological, and computational models of lightness perception invoke early sensory mechanisms that act independently of, or before, the estimation of other scene attributes. In contrast to the modularity of lightness perception assumed in these models are experiments that show that supposedly 'higher-order' percepts of planar surface attributes, such as orientation, depth and transparency, can influence perceived lightness. Here we show that perceived surface curvature can also affect perceived lightness. The results of the earlier experiments indicate that perceiving luminance edges as changes in surface attributes other than reflectance can influence lightness. These results suggest that the interpretation of smooth variations in luminance can also affect lightness percepts.\r"

To understand the mechanisms responsible for its various actions, the receptor for angiotensin II has long been sought, but numerous attempts to purify the receptor have been unsuccessful owing to its instability and low concentration. We report here the expression cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a bovine angiotensin II receptor to overcome these difficulties. The receptor cDNA encodes a protein of 359 amino-acid residues with a transmembrane topology similar to that of other G protein-coupled receptors. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed specific and high-affinity binding sites for angiotensin II, angiotensin II antagonist and a non-peptide specific antagonist for type-1 receptor. Dithiothreitol inhibited ligand binding. The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ and of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate increased in the transfected COS-7 cells in response to angiotensin II or angiotensin III, indicating that this receptor is the type-1 receptor for angiotensin II. Northern blot analysis revealed that the messenger RNA for this receptor is expressed in bovine adrenal medulla, cortex and kidney.\r"

Its importance is manifested by the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II interacts with two pharmacologically distinct subtypes of cell-surface receptors, AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors seem to mediate the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Here we report the isolation by expression cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a unique protein with the pharmacological specificity of a vascular AT1 receptor. Hydropathic modelling of the deduced protein suggests that it shares the seven-transmembrane-region motif with the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Knowledge of the AT1 receptor primary sequence should now permit structural analysis, definition of the angiotensin II receptor gene family and delineation of the contribution of AT receptors to the genetic component of hypertension.\r"

The mutations include deletions but also duplications and point mutations. Individuals with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) carry a common A-to-G substitution in a highly conserved portion of the gene for transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)). Although the MELAS mutation may be comparable to the defect in the tRNA(Lys) gene associated with MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres), it is also embedded in the middle of a tridecamer sequence necessary for the formation of the 3' ends of 16S ribosomal RNA in vitro. We found that the MELAS mutation results in severe impairment of 16S rRNA transcription termination, which correlates with a reduced affinity of the partially purified termination protein for the MELAS template. This suggests that the molecular defect in MELAS is the inability to produce the correct type and quantity of rRNA relative to other mitochondrial gene products.\r"

This modification of DNA methylation in the embryo has also been observed in transgenic mice and in transfection experiments. Here we report the fate in mice of an in vitro-methylated adenine phosphoribosyltransferase transgene. The entire 5' CpG island region became demethylated, whereas the 3' end of the gene remained modified and was even methylated de novo at additional sites. Transfection experiments in vitro show that the demethylation is rapid, is specific for embryonic cell-types and affects a variety of different CpG island sequences. This suggests that gene sequences can be recognized in the early embryo and imprinted with the correct methylation pattern through a combination of demethylation and de novo methylation.\r"

The phosphatase(s) involved in p34cdc2 dephosphorylation is unknown, but the product of the fission yeast cdc25+ gene, and its homologues in budding yeast and Drosophila are probably positive regulators of the transition from G2 to M phase. We have purified the inactive p34cdc2/cyclin B complex from G2-arrested starfish oocytes. Addition of the purified bacterially expressed product of the human homologue of the fission yeast cdc25+ gene (p54CDC25H) triggers p34cdc2 dephosphorylation and activates H1 histone kinase activity in this preparation. We propose that the cdc25+ gene product directly activates the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex.\r"

  ".W": "In rapidly growing cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell cycle is regulated chiefly at Start, just before the G1-S boundary, whereas in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the cycle is predominantly regulated at G2-M. Both control points are present in both yeasts, and both require the p34cdc2 protein kinase. At G2-M, p34cdc2 kinase activity in S. pombe requires a B-type cyclin in a complex with p34cdc2; this complex is the same as MPF (maturation promoting factor). The p34cdc2 activity at the G1-S transition in S. cerevisiae may be regulated by a similar cyclin complex, using one of the products of a new class of cyclin genes (CLN1, CLN2 and WHI1 (DAF1/CLN3)). At least one is required for progression through the G1-S phase, and deletion of all three leads to G1 arrest. WHI1 was isolated as a dominant allele causing budding yeast cells to divide at a reduced size and was later independently identified as DAF1, a dominant allele of which rendered the cells refractory to the G1-arrest induced by the mating pheromone alpha-factor. The dominant alleles are truncations thought to yield proteins of increased stability, and the cells are accelerated through G1. Without WHI1 function, the cells are hypersensitive to alpha-factor, enlarged and delayed in G1. Heretofore, this G1-class of cyclins has not been identified in other organisms. We have isolated a G1-type cyclin gene called puc1+ from S. pombe, using a functional assay in S. cerevisiae. Expression of puc1+ in S. pombe indicates that it has a cyclin-like role in the fission yeast distinct from the role of the B-type mitotic cyclin.\r"

  ".W": "The major FK506 binding protein (FKBP, relative molecular mass approximately 11,800; Mr 11.8K) and cyclophilin (Mr approximately 17K) belong to a class of proteins termed immunophilins. Although unrelated at the amino-acid sequence level, they both possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities which are inhibited by immunosuppressants that block signal transduction pathways leading to T-lymphocyte activation. FK506 and rapamycin strongly inhibit the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of FKBP, whereas cyclosporin A inhibits that of cyclophilin. The significance of this enzyme activity and the role of the immunophilins in immunoregulation is unknown. To understand better the function of the immunophilins and their interaction with inhibitors, we are investigating the solution structures of FKBP and FKBP-inhibitor complexes by multidimensional NMR methods. Here we report the solution conformation of FKBP, as generated by NMR, distance geometry and molecular dynamics methods. The regular secondary structure of FKBP is composed mainly of beta sheet (approximately 35%) with little helical structure (less than 10%). The hydrophobic core of the molecule, containing the buried side chains of six of the protein's nine aromatic amino acids, is enclosed by a five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet on one side, a loop and a short helix at residues 51-56 and 57-65, and an aperiodic loop at residues 81-95. Examination of the structure suggests a possible site of interaction with FK506.\r"

In contrast, only 3% of the CSF samples taken from control patients or patients with neurologic symptoms other than PD possessed this antibody. The production of this antibody might contribute to disease progression but does not appear to be the etiologic factor responsible for PD. In other experiments, concentrates of the CSF of patients with PD enhanced growth of mesencephalic cultures relative to control CSF. Both the antibody and the growth-promoting activity found in CSF are associated with degeneration of the SN and might therefore be useful as potential diagnostic markers for PD.\r"

Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a \"slow toxin\" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease.\r"

A list of questions regarding possible risk factors, specific symptoms, and observations of family members could be combined in a self-administered questionnaire that might identify individuals with a high probability of early, but otherwise undiagnosable, Parkinson's disease. Identification of subtle motor features is another possible screening method. For example, handwriting and speech are commonly affected prior to diagnosis; thus, automated analysis of these motor actions might also provide detection of incipient disease.\r"

In addition to an apparent stability of marriages and lack of alcoholism, patients with PD are less likely than controls to be smokers. It has been suggested that nicotine and its byproducts are not actually protective against PD, and it could be postulated that higher-than-average intrinsic dopamine may facilitate addiction. Smoking for the patient who is later to develop PD may be particularly unrewarding. In addition, the postulated personality for PD may predispose to hard work, perspiration, and increased exposure to putative trace elements in the water supply.\r"

  ".W": "Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate.\r"

The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs.\r"

Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase. If hepatic enzyme abnormalities contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease, molecular genetic techniques may allow the development of screening tests to identify at-risk subjects in order to intervene with protective therapies.\r"

Fatality rates and neurologic sequelae were compared for the 2 treatment groups in the 160 patients who had cerebrospinal fluid cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The overall mortality rate of 51% reflects the delay in receiving appropriate therapy (79% with symptoms for more than 2 weeks) and the severity of illness on admission (56% in coma, 39% drowsy). The fatality rate was significantly lower in the group receiving dexamethasone (43% vs. 59%, P less than 0.05), particularly in the drowsy patients (15% vs. 40% P less than 0.04), and in patients surviving long enough to receive at least 10 days of treatment (14% vs. 33%, P less than 0.02).

  ".W": "In June, 1989, an outbreak of nosocomial listeriosis occurred in Costa Rica. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 9 ill infants 4 to 8 days old who were born after the delivery of an infant with early onset listeriosis. One nosocomial infection was fatal, 2 required mechanical ventilation and 1 resulted in hemiparesis. A higher proportion of cases than other infants born during the outbreak were delivered by cesarean section (55% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). Compared with the mothers of 36 random controls, case mothers were more often primiparous (odds ratio, 6.2, P = 0.03) or received general anesthesia before delivery (odds ratio, 4.4, P = 0.09). All infants were bathed with mineral oil from a multidose container. Culture of the oil by cold enrichment grew L. monocytogenes 4b with the same electrophoretic enzyme type as the outbreak strain. We hypothesize that aspiration of contaminated oil may have resulted in systemic listeriosis. General anesthesia may have increased the risk of aspiration. Lung tissue from the infant who died showed lipid-laden macrophages consistent with oil aspiration and had evidence of L. monocytogenes DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction. This is the first nosocomial outbreak of listeriosis in which a common source suggested epidemiologically was microbiologically confirmed. The high attack rate (greater than 200 times the United States rate of perinatal listeriosis) emphasizes the susceptibility of healthy neonates to L. monocytogenes. The results of our study led to the discontinuation of the use of mineral oil for bathing neonates in Costa Rica.\r"

Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. A thickened pleural \"peel,\" scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).\r"

Murine typhus, more an urban disease, was milder and half the patients presented exclusively because of night fever. Slightly enlarged liver and skin rash were the only significant physical signs. Lacking the classical textbook presentations, both rickettsioses often were missed or diagnosed as enteric fever. Recognition is important because patients with either disease respond well to treatment with chloramphenicol or doxycycline.\r"

Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.\r"

Among 630,157 recipients of measles-mumps-rubella trivalent (MMR) vaccine containing the Urabe Am9 mumps vaccine, there were at least 311 meningitis cases suspected to be vaccine-related. In 96 of these 311 cases, mumps virus related to the vaccine was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The unusually high incidence may have been partly a result of the adverse media publicity of the problem at the time of surveillance. We analyzed clinical features of 165 and 27 laboratory-confirmed mumps vaccine-related meningitis cases that occurred among the recipients of MMR and monovalent mumps vaccines, respectively, during a 1-year period after the introduction of MMR vaccine. The incidence of vaccine-related meningitis was similar among the recipients of MMR and monovalent Urabe Am9 mumps vaccines. Meningitis was generally mild and there were no sequelae from the illness. The complication was more frequent among male than among female children.\r"

Ribavirin determinations were made by high performance liquid chromatography. A 5- to greater than 20-fold decrease in ambient ribavirin concentrations was observed with the containment system compared with those detected with a single oxyhood in use. The personal breathing zone concentration was 566.0 micrograms/m3 with the oxyhood alone and fell to a mean concentration of 43.81 +/- 33.40 micrograms/m3 with the containment system.

Despite yearly increases in the number of cases of acute flaccid paralysis reported to the surveillance system, a decline in reported confirmed cases of polio has occurred since 1986 to record low levels in 1989. Cases in 1989 were reported from only 0.7% of the counties in the Americas. The occurrence of 24 wild-type virus isolates in 1989 were limited to only three geographic areas: northwestern Mexico; the northern Andean Region; and northeastern Brazil. At this writing the clock is ticking with only 3 months left to achieve the goal of interrupting transmission by the end of 1990. If the current level of effort is sustained and special efforts are directed at the remaining foci of infection, the eradication of the transmission of wild-type poliovirus from the Americas can be achieved. Continued external financial support will be critical if the effort is to succeed. The prospect of poliomyelitis eradication in the Americas led the 41st World Health Assembly of WHO to adopt a resolution in May, 1988, to eradicate the indigenous transmission of wild-type poliovirus from the world by the year 2000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between January 1985 and February 1989, 45 cases of meningitis and 27 cases of non-CNS infection due to ampicillin-resistant Hib were documented at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Of the 45 children with meningitis, 26 (57.8%) were treated with cefotaxime, 11 (24.4%) with chloramphenicol, and three (6.7%) with cefuroxime; five children (11.1%) were initially given chloramphenicol but later received cefotaxime instead. In addition, 14 chloramphenicol-treated patients from a previous study were included in this analysis. There were no significant differences in terms of neurologic sequelae or other complications (except diarrhea) between the cefotaxime and chloramphenicol groups. The efficacy of cefotaxime was equivalent to that of chloramphenicol for the treatment of ampicillin-resistant Hib meningitis. Cefuroxime was as safe and effective as chloramphenicol or cefotaxime for the treatment of non-CNS infections due to ampicillin-resistant Hib.\r"

We describe four patients with neutropenia and progressive malignancy who had symptomatic L. buccalis bacteremia, and we review an additional four cases from the literature. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (range, 7-73 years), with an equal number of males and females. The number of positive blood cultures in each case ranged from one to four (mean, two); these cultures became positive after 48-120 hours (median, 54 hours). All tested isolates were sensitive to the beta-lactam agents, clindamycin, tetracycline, and metronidazole; five of seven were sensitive to chloramphenicol; and not one was sensitive to the aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Seven patients had one or more possible portals of entry for bacteremia, including mucositis (four patients), mucositis plus esophageal lesions (two), and possible mucositis plus diverticulitis (one). L. buccalis should be considered a potential pathogen in neutropenic patients, especially when breaks in the mucosal breaks in the mucosal barriers are present.\r"

The possible etiology of the JHR is discussed, and comparisons with the changes occurring in septic shock are made; a study of either condition facilitates the understanding of the other. Tumor necrosis factor is hypothesized to play a key role in both. Current treatment of the JHR consists of general clinical support. Specific measures such as oxpentifylline therapy may play a role in the future.\r"

Because acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was the most common underlying disease in patients with candidemia, risk factors for candidemia were analyzed in this subset of patients. A case-control study comparing the eight ALL patients who had candidemia with 18 ALL control patients revealed that previous bacteremia, prolonged neutropenia, prolonged fever, prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents, treatment with multiple antimicrobial agents, and a relatively high concentration of Candida organisms in stool were significant risk factors for candidemia. In a logistic regression analysis, however, only receipt of vancomycin and/or imipenem was identified as an independent risk factor for candidemia. Further analysis showed that administration of vancomycin promoted proliferation of Candida organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and that this proliferation was associated with an increased risk of candidemia.\r"

In contrast to N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. lactamica lacks virulence properties. As 100% of N. lactamica strains are susceptible to penicillin and all three previously described patients with N. lactamica meningitis have recovered with penicillin treatment, the reason for distinguishing the organisms in this context is primarily to prevent unnecessary anxiety and prophylaxis among contacts.\r"

Two of the patients, including one with what is thought to be the first reported case of meningitis due to C. luteola, had complications caused by prosthetic material. A review of the literature revealed 14 well-described cases of infection with C. luteola or F. oryzihabitans, the majority of which were cases of bacteremia or peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis. The presence of foreign material and the use of corticosteroids may predispose to and influence the course of disease. As prosthetic material becomes even more widely used, the incidence of infection with bacteria of the Ve group will likely increase and the manifestations of the infections will probably become more varied.\r"

High serum CPK levels were detected in 70 (28%) of 247 febrile patients but in only six (6%) of 105 afebrile control patients (P = .0001). Elevated CPK levels were not related to any specific diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis identified five factors that correlated both significantly and independently with elevation of CPK values: increased blood urea nitrogen level, low serum phosphate level, a stuporous or comatose state, tremor, and muscle tenderness. Myoglobinuria, detected in 14 patients, was predictive of a fatal outcome, but a high CPK level by itself was not an independent correlate of mortality. In summary, CPK elevation is not uncommon in febrile diseases, but because it does not reflect a specific etiology it does not necessarily indicate that an extensive diagnostic work-up is required.\r"

Cetrimide became the local scolecidal agent of choice; a role for albendazole in systemic chemotherapy is anticipated. Elective surgery in 30 patients was safe, but urgent surgery in seven patients with acute complications from cyst rupture was followed by substantial morbidity and mortality.\r"

Examination of trends in the incidence of shigellosis in Israel between 1951 and 1987 showed a period of declining rates followed by an increase in the reported incidence beginning around 1969. This increase was mainly due to Shigella sonnei; rates of infection with Shigella flexneri remained relatively constant. Trends showed marked differences between age groups and between ethnic groups. In comparison, the rates in the United States--much lower than those in Israel--began to decline in the early 1950s and have remained low. The incidence in Israel is now about 20 times higher than that in the United States. Thus shigellosis remains a major and growing public health problem in Israel, a country that has enjoyed a dramatic improvement in basic sanitary services and infrastructure over the past few decades. This disturbing finding lends urgency to efforts to control the disease.\r"

We describe three cases of polymicrobial infection secondary to infection with group Ve organisms, including the first reported case (to our knowledge) of CNS infection due to F. oryzihabitans. These three cases and a review of literature suggest an association between the presence of indwelling catheters and polymicrobial infections with CDC group Ve organisms. F. oryzihabitans and C. luteola should be added to the expanding list of nosocomial pathogens with a propensity to infect critically ill patients who have undergone surgical procedures and/or had indwelling catheters placed. The isolation of either of these organisms from clinical specimens should prompt a search for a device-related source.\r"

When these results were combined with our previous data (from a study of diagnostic stool samples), the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among children less than 5 years of age in the Helsinki area was calculated to be less than 0.18%. The worldwide prevalence of Cryptosporidium among asymptomatic children is less than 0.5% if a few exceptional localities with high prevalences (which probably have a local explanation) are excluded from the calculations. Since the Helsinki area turned out to be no exception, the age distribution of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis also needs further study that would take into account simultaneous asymptomatic carrier rates and a significant local variation.\r"

Large studies of nosocomial fungemia are also summarized to emphasize the growing contribution of NAC to the total number of infections in humans, especially immunocompromised patients. The infrequency of ocular involvement in NAC infection is supported by studies in experimental animals that demonstrate a lower incidence of NAC endophthalmitis than of C. albicans endophthalmitis in the presence of disseminated infection. Since endophthalmitis in the absence of exogenous infection suggests disseminated candidal infection and since most NAC strains are relatively resistant to amphotericin B, it is important to recognize and appropriately treat endophthalmitis due to NAC.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews functionally important insights into the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The major sequela of this infection is early and progressive involvement of the immune system, with widespread immune dysfunction. This pathogenetic feature has a major impact on strategies for control of the infection. The immunosuppression caused by the virus leads to higher levels of viral replication and enhanced potential for development or selection of variant viruses, including forms that are more virulent or even drug resistant. Therefore, control of HIV infection and disease may require antiviral agents and CD4 receptor competitors as well as recombinant DNA-derived lymphokines and subunit vaccine immunotherapies. To be successful, such therapies must work to counter infection in monocytes and nonlymphoid cells as well as in T4 lymphocytes. Because many limbs of the immune system are affected by HIV infection, the complexities of this pathogen can be unraveled only by the careful study of immune functions during the disease and of effective interventions to control infection and disease and to restore immune functions.\r"

  ".W": "During the 15th and 16th centuries in England, there were five epidemics of a disease characterized by fever and profuse sweating and associated with high mortality. This disease became known as the English sweating sickness. The first epidemic occurred during 1485 at around the time of Henry Tudor's victory at Bosworth Field, and the last took place during the reign of Edward VI in 1551. The disease tended to occur during the summer and early autumn. The relatively affluent male adult population, particularly the clergy, seemed to suffer the highest attack rates, and, except in one epidemic, the disease appears to have attacked only individuals native to England. Despite the reputation of the English sweating sickness as a disease with a high fatality rate, records of burials and wills in Chester suggest that the 1551 epidemic did not have a marked effect on the demographics of the population. The etiologic agent is still unknown, although an enterovirus seems to this author to be the most likely pathogen.\r"

We report on five cases of adverse reactions due to bacterial contamination of blood products, and we review 76 similar cases reported in the English-language literature. Most cases (70%) have been reported from the United States. Various sources of contamination have been suggested, including infection in the donor and invasion of the blood product during the process of collection, preparation, and storage. Frequent clinical manifestations are fever (80%), chills (53%), hypotension (37%), and nausea or vomiting (26%). The overall mortality is 35% (28 of 81 patients). In 38 patients (47%) the adverse reactions have appeared during transfusion; in the others the interval between completion of the transfusion and appearance of symptoms has ranged from 15 minutes to 17 days. A wide spectrum of bacteria have been implicated as causes of adverse reactions, with Pseudomonas species involved in 28% of episodes. Many such reactions are probably misdiagnosed or overlooked, the result being underestimation of the extent of the problem.\r"

The purpose of this workshop was to present and discuss current information on the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CMV disease in mothers and their infants. The participants concluded that congenital CMV disease is a significant public health problem that, to date, has been largely ignored. They also agreed that certain child-rearing practices, such as the common use of day-care centers and breast-feeding, have changed the epidemiology of CMV in the United States and that the next decade may bring an increase in congenital CMV disease in certain groups. Therefore, a national system for surveillance of congenital CMV disease was established; its goals are to characterize trends over time, to identify risk groups, and to lay the groundwork for evaluation of future intervention programs. In addition, the surveillance system will be used to educate the medical and lay communities about congenital CMV disease and to facilitate collaborative efforts in research.\r"

We prospectively studied 100 consecutive SICU admissions, looking for predictors of early death in the SICU and the cost implications of these findings. Serial APACHE II scores on days 1, 3, and 5 were subjected to multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of death in the SICU on day 1. Survivors had significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean day-1 APACHE II scores than had nonsurvivors (13.6 vs 22.1). Half of the patients with scores greater than 18 died, and all patients with scores on day 1 of 25 or greater died. Significant predictors of death on SICU day 1 were APACHE II scores, Acute Physiology Score, Glasgow Coma Score, creatinine level, and Chronic Health Evaluation Score. Forty-one patients had been transferred from community hospitals as a results of acute illness; this population accounted for two thirds of the deaths in the SICU. Ten of 18 nonsurvivors were predicted on day 1, with these patients incurring a total cost of approximately $1 million. If therapy had been modified on days 5, 10, or 15, the potential cost savings would have been $340,000, $240,000, or $140,000, respectively. Integration of the results of this study into the management decision-making process and treatment guidelines may reduce the cost of care in the SICU.\r"

Mice were treated with a single intravenous dose of saline, rTNF, rIL-1 or both cytokines and challenged within 2 hours to 10 days with a lethal dose of rTNF. Mice treated with rTNF showed significant protection against the lethal effects of TNF when the treatment dose was given only 2 hours before the lethal dose, but maximal protection required a 24-hour interval and lasted as long as 8 days. The treatment dose of rTNF was toxic, and it resulted in occasional treatment deaths. Mice treated with rIL-1 showed maximal protection when treatment was given only 2 hours before challenge and protection lasted for 8 days. No toxicity was apparent secondary to IL-1 treatment. The combination of rIL-1 and rTNF was not as effective as either cytokine alone. The results suggest that rTNF or rIL-1 may be clinically useful in the prevention and treatment of sepsis lethality by the induction of tolerance to the lethal effects of TNF. The more promising cytokine appears to be rIL-1 because it has less toxicity and more rapid induction of full therapeutic effectiveness.\r"

The microcapsules consisted of in vitro dissolvable polymolecular poly L-lactic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). The 5Fu-mc was about 200 microns in diameter and had a 5Fu content of about 40% (weight/weight). 5Fu-release time from the microcapsules was about 50 hours in vitro and about 48 hours in vivo. After the release of the 5Fu, the poly L-lactic acid was metabolized very slowly in the peritoneal cavity. The 5Fu-mc caused fewer side effects than the equivalent dose of a 5Fu solution. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of various abdominal organs revealed no toxic effects from the microcapsules. After administration of 5Fu-mc into the abdominal cavity of rats with AH-130 carcinomatous peritonitis, the 5Fu concentration remained at a high level for an extended period in the ascites but fell rapidly to low levels in the plasma. In conclusion, the present studies indicated that the 5Fu-mc were much more effective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing hosts while producing less systemic side effects than a 5Fu solution.\r"

The Universal Medical Student Performance Profile System involved the use of a standardized student evaluation form completed by surgery clerkship directors to summarize student performance. These student profile forms were then forwarded to general surgery program directors to whom each student applied. Twenty-five surgery clerkship directors volunteered to complete student profile forms on students pursuing surgical careers for the classes of 1986 and 1987. Program directors who had accepted students in their programs on whom these standardized evaluation forms had been completed were asked to complete a similar form based on the graduate's first year of residency performance. Findings showed statistically significant relationships in several assessment categories between clerkship and program directors' ratings. A survey of program directors showed they agreed with the concept of a standardized medical student evaluation form and found the student profile forms helpful in making decisions on resident selection. We concluded form this baseline study that the use of a standardized student evaluation form will have limited predictive validity, unless clerkships improve efforts to standardize clerkship objectives, expectations, and performance measures.\r"

  ".W": "The standard stainless steel Greenfield filter was modified by extending the limbs at the apex to permit loading into a 12F carrier for percutaneous insertion. This model was tested for fixation and resolution of experimental embolism in dogs (six filters in four dogs) and sheep (eight suprarenal filters in eight sheep). Serial radiographs and venacavography at 2 and 4 weeks allowed measurement of migration and suspected caval penetration, confirmed by direct examination at autopsy. Caval penetration was graded according to visibility of point (0), hook (1+), or limb (2+) for each limb of the filter. Oxidized cellulose-induced thrombi were injected and trapped in two dogs and four sheep without proximal filter displacement or thrombus propagation. Thrombi showed incomplete resolution during 4 weeks' observation by interval venacavography and subsequent autopsy but no tendency for proximal propagation. Distal migration occurred in four of six filters in dogs, and caval wall penetration was seen (score 1.8/filter). Less migration was seen in sheep (2/8), but there was evidence of hook penetration in four animals (score 0.88/filter). Intravascular ultrasonography, 20 MHz, with a 6.5 F catheter assembly successfully visualized all 10 filters in which it was attempted and showed thrombi attached to the filter or caval wall, all of which were confirmed at explant. No thrombi were missed; however, intravascular ultrasonography was limited in assessment of caval wall penetration by lack of position control and reverberation artifact. Although it performs well as a filter, the elasticity of the percutaneous stainless steel greenfield filter allows distal migration and caval penetration comparable to the titanium Greenfield filter and will require further modification of hook design to improve performance.\r"

An ultrasonic duplex scanner was used to document the presence of reflux in all segments of the superficial and deep system. In the entire group of 25 limbs with ulceration, valvular incompetence was noted in 22 limbs at levels involving segments that communicated with the ulcer-bearing area. Of the 17 limbs with normal ankle skin, in only two instances was a single segment of posterior tibial vein in midcalf found to be incompetent. For those patients with normal ankle skin and a history of varicose veins, the deep veins below the common femoral vein level were always competent.\r"

In about one fourth of the cases, routine gonadal phlebography was not technically feasible or did not correlate exactly with the operative findings. Some cases of male varicocele showed recurrence after surgery. These facts, in addition to the scarce information provided by anatomy textbooks, induced us to study thoroughly the gonadal veins. One hundred cadaver dissections (200 veins) were done for length, diameter, number, and location of valves and collaterals, number of trunks in each side, and mode of termination in the renal vein and vena cava. Topographic division of the veins by thirds facilitated the information. Variations from the classic anatomic description were encountered frequently. As to the number of trunks, at the middle third, where the vein is usually divided, only 60% have one trunk on the left and only 75% have one on the right side. The rest are multiple; as many as four and six trunks in the lower third were found. The knowledge of these anatomic variations, not clearly described before, is of great importance to both surgeons and invasive radiologists and conducive to successful results.\r"

Numerous clinical studies in the past have attempted to address this controversy but have failed to resolve the issue for different reasons. These include retrospective design, inclusion of only selected cases, and randomization before surgery. In this study 479 patients undergoing cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to a drainage group (a high-pressure suction drain in Morison's pouch for 48 hours) or a nondrainage group. Randomization was performed at the time of peritoneal closure. All patients undergoing cholecystectomy, both elective and urgent, were included and the operations were performed by all grades of surgeons. There were two deaths from cardiopulmonary causes, both in the drainage group. No patient required reoperation in either group. The incidence of both wound infections (15 vs 5; p less than 0.05) and chest infections (56 vs 19, p less than 0.02) was significantly higher in the drainage group. Three hundred fifty-six patients underwent abdominal ultrasonography 72 hours after surgery. The number of subhepatic fluid collections thus detected was significantly higher in the patients who received a drain (17 vs 6, p less than 0.05). None of these collections was clinically significant. The postoperative hospital stay was longer in the patients with drains (10.3 vs 9.1 days), but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. We conclude from this study that the use of a drain after cholecystectomy serves no useful purpose and is potentially harmful. This practice should be abandoned.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients undergoing curative resection for colorectal cancer were studied to determine the effect of the tumor on lymphocytes circulating through it. In the venous blood draining the tumor, there was an increased percentage of natural killer (NK) cells (p = 0.001), no difference in overall NK cell function, and decreased T-lymphocyte activation (p = 0.035) and proliferation (p = 0.002) compared with the lymphocytes in the arterial blood supplying the tumor. There were no significant differences in the control group of 16 patients. Local effects of colorectal cancer may include the ability to down-regulate T and NK cell function while increasing the number of NK cells. Means of enhancing antitumor activity therapeutically in an adjuvant setting, possibly through the portal vein during surgery, need to be considered, especially in the light of the immunosuppressive effects of surgery.\r"

Results showed that gastric motility and emptying time of dogs after PAFPG were close to normal. PAFPG was applied to 125 consecutive patients with gastroduodenal ulcers (gastric ulcer, 15 patients; duodenal ulcer, 94 patients; and combined ulcers, 16 patients) confirmed by barium examination and fibro-gastroendoscopy. All patients recovered smoothly, none of them had postoperative complication. Gastric acid output reduction rates were as follows: basal acid output, 85.05% +/- 8.13%; maximal acid output, 81.76% +/- 10.85%; peak acid output, 81.42% +/- 10.15%. The incidence of postoperative enterogastric reflux (endoscopically) and the concentration of cholic acids in gastric juice were significantly lower in patients after PAFPG than after Billroth I or II gastrectomy. Results suggest that PAFPG reduced gastric acid outputs definitely and overcame adverse motility consequences after Billroth I or II gastrectomy desirably.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-6, which has been shown to be increased in patients with burn injuries, is produced by activated monocytes and endothelial cells and has many in vitro activities, including stimulation of acute-phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes, immunoglobulin synthesis in B lymphocytes, and stimulation of growth of megakaryocytes. In 13 patients with a mean of 31% full-thickness burns, we studied the relation of serum interleukin-6 to clinical parameters and parameters of the acute-phase response and immunoglobulin production. Interleukin-6 was already elevated within hours after the injury was sustained, and it remained elevated for several weeks. All components of the acute-phase response were observed: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis with an associated left shift, elevation of C-reactive protein and alpha 1-antitrypsin, and a decrease in albumin levels. In the second week after burn injury, immunoglobulin M levels peaked, followed by a prolonged elevation of immunoglobulin G levels. Thrombocyte counts initially decreased and rebounded to supranormal levels after 2 weeks. Interleukin-6 levels were positively correlated with acute-phase responses. We believe that the production of interleukin-6 induces the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. High interleukin-6 levels may also be an etiologic factor in the marked immunoglobulin response observed. Likewise, the relation between the megakaryocyte-promoting activity of interleukin-6 and the rebound thrombocytosis requires further investigation.\r"

Lewis isografts and Lewis Brown Norway F1 allograft recipient rats had comparable degrees of morphologic (increased bowel diameter, crypt depth, and villus height) and functional (absorption of 3H-glucose, 14C-maltose, and cyclosporine) compensation. These changes were already present by day 25 and persisted until at least day 150. The results were independent of the loss of extrinsic innervation or the intramuscular administration of cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day). These observations support the usefulness of segmental intestinal transplantation in the treatment of surgically induced short bowel syndrome.\r"

Sinus disease, colds, allergies, abrupt temperature changes and dry heat produce fragile and hyperemic nasal mucosa that bleeds easily with nose blowing or mild abrasion. Anterior epistaxis can be reached easily and stopped by pinching the nostrils, applying silver nitrate cautery or lightly packing the anterior nose. Posterior epistaxis may be severe and may be more difficult to locate and control. Occurring more often in the elderly, posterior nosebleeds are frequently associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis and conditions that decrease platelets and clotting function. Visualization of the bleeding site is enhanced by proper positioning of the patient, use of topical vasoconstricting anesthesia and suctioning. Anterior and posterior nasal packing, hospitalization, antibiotics and close follow-up may be required to control posterior nosebleeds.\r"

Unlike chronic middle ear effusion or recurrent otitis media, a cholesteatoma inexorably destroys the middle and inner ear. Delayed diagnosis increases the chance of otologic complications, such as permanent hearing loss, permanent balance dysfunction, infection and facial paralysis. Initial management includes careful cleansing of the ear and topical and oral antibiotics. Definitive treatment requires surgical excision.\r"

Morbid obesity is characterized by an increased number of adipocytes and a degree of irreversibility. Overeating increases the size of adipocytes; however, once adipocytes achieve their maximal size, proliferation is induced and massive, irreversible obesity may result. A syndrome of restrained eating produced by chronic dieting leads to hunger, frustration and rebound overeating. Treatment may be unsuccessful because of the failure to address specific causes of obesity in individual patients and the use of reducing regimens that are not designed to maintain weight loss. Recognition of the diverse clinical forms of obesity and their different etiologies permits treatment regimens to be more specific, increasing the likelihood of success. Even with this approach, treatment failure is common.\r"

Dystonic movement disorders in the cranial-cervical region, including essential blepharospasm, Meige syndrome and spasmodic torticollis, are characterized by uncontrollable squeezing movements in the face and neck. These disorders typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Essential blepharospasm is particularly debilitating, as the involuntary eyelid closure that accompanies this condition may result in functional blindness with an otherwise normal visual pathway. Hemifacial spasm is an intermittent, unilateral, spasmodic contraction of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. This disorder usually presents in the third or fourth decade and has a different underlying pathophysiology than the dystonias. Botulinum A toxin therapy has largely supplanted surgical intervention in the treatment of essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm.\r"

PET studies using 60 mCi of Rb-82 were performed at baseline and after intravenous infusion of 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole in conjunction with handgrip stress. Tl-201 SPECT was performed after dipyridamole-handgrip stress and, in a subset of patients, after treadmill exercise. Sensitivity, specificity and overall diagnostic accuracy were assessed using both visually and quantitatively interpreted coronary angiograms. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET for detection of coronary artery disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) were 84, 88 and 85%, respectively. In comparison, the performance of SPECT revealed a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 53% (p less than 0.05 vs PET) and accuracy of 79%. Similar results were obtained using either visual or quantitative angiographic criteria for severity of coronary artery disease. In 43 patients without prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity for detection of disease was 71 and 73%, respectively, similar for both PET and SPECT. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between imaging modalities when 2 different modes of stress (exercise treadmill vs intravenous dipyridamole plus handgrip) were used with SPECT imaging. Thus, Rb-82 PET provides improved specificity compared with Tl-201 SPECT for identifying coronary artery disease, most likely due to the higher photon energy of Rb-82 and attenuation correction provided by PET. However, post-test referral cannot be entirely excluded as a potential explanation for the lower specificity of Tl-201 SPECT.\r"

Dobutamine (2.5 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) was infused in 3-minute stages. Digital echocardiograms were recorded on-line at baseline, during low- and high-dose dobutamine infusion, and at recovery. An echocardiogram positive for CAD was defined as one showing a new wall motion abnormality induced by dobutamine. Compared with coronary angiography, the overall sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography for detecting CAD was 86%, specificity 95% and accuracy 89%. The sensitivity for detecting 3-vessel CAD was 100%, 89% for 2-vessel and 69% for 1-vessel CAD. The accuracy of predicting multivessel disease by 2 methods was 71% and 84%, respectively. Heart rate at the echocardiographic ischemic threshold was lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (89 +/- 17, 95 +/- 18 and 118 +/- 18 beats/min, respectively, p less than 0.01); rate-pressure product was also lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (12.7 +/- 3.6, 13.7 +/- 2.8 and 18.9 +/- 44 x 10(3) beats/min x mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.01). Heart rate was the most important physiologic determinant of ischemia induced by dobutamine. There were no major complications during the study. Thus, dobutamine digital echocardiography is an excellent test for identifying CAD and should be beneficial in patients unable to exercise.\r"

The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the hemodynamic and antiischemic effects of this compound given as an adjunctive to conventional medical therapy in 113 patients with unstable angina. Fifty-nine patients received esmolol and 54 received matching placebo infusions. Esmolol was titrated in a step-wise manner at dosages of 2 to 24 mg/min until a 25% reduction in the double product was achieved; thereafter, esmolol was continuously infused for up to 72 hours. Esmolol caused a significant and persistent decline in heart rate and blood pressure throughout the entire study period. Clinical events, such as development of acute myocardial infarction or the need for urgent revascularization, occurred in 3 esmolol compared with 9 placebo patients (p = 0.06). There was also a trend toward reduction of silent ischemia as judged by Holter monitoring (mean [+/- standard deviation] duration/patient/24 hours, 21 +/- 81 minutes in the esmolol and 35 +/- 128 minutes in the placebo groups). Esmolol-related adverse effects were mostly cardiovascular in origin and could be managed promptly by downward dose titration or cessation of drug infusion. Thus, esmolol appears to be a safe and effective drug for patients with unstable angina because it permits a large degree of flexibility in adapting the desired level of beta blockade to the patient's changing clinical presentation.\r"

It is hypothesized that, unlike markers of platelet activation and fibrin formation, D-dimer, a product of plasmin-mediated proteolysis of cross-linked fibrin, is not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and could be used to study intracoronary fibrin degradation during angioplasty. No significant difference in D-dimer levels was noted in serial plasma samples obtained from an 8Fr arterial sheath and the wire lumen of an angioplasty balloon catheter, indicating that sampling through the catheter lumen did not induce artifactual D-dimer elevations. Translesion (proximal and distal to the lesion) coronary blood samples were collected in 31 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty pretreated with aspirin, dipyridamole and heparin. In 20 of those in whom translesion coronary samples for plasma D-dimer levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were collected before balloon dilation, there was no evidence of ongoing intracoronary fibrinolysis (proximal D-dimer levels, 289 +/- 145 ng/ml; distal, 299 +/- 156 ng/ml; difference not significant). After coronary angioplasty (n = 31), there was a relatively small, but significant (p less than 0.001) increase (45 +/- 71 ng/ml) in translesional D-dimer levels (proximal, 396 +/- 223 ng/ml; distal, 441 +/- 257 ng/ml). The results from this study suggest (1) D-dimer levels are not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and may be useful for assessment of intracoronary fibrin metabolism, and (2) intracoronary degradation of fibrin can be detected after (but not before) routine coronary angioplasty despite pretreatment with antithrombotic therapy, presumably in response to balloon-induced arterial injury and fibrin formation.\r"

Criteria of positivity were: for the exercise electrocardiography test, an ST-segment shift greater than or equal to 0.1 mV from baseline, 0.08 second from the J point; for the dipyridamole echocardiography test, a transient dyssynergy of contraction, absent or of a lesser degree than that in the baseline examination. The exercise electrocardiography and dipyridamole echocardiography tests revealed a similar feasibility (91 vs 87%, difference not significant). Both tests could be performed in 75 patients. For detection of restenosis or disease progression, or both, the exercise electrocardiography test revealed a sensitivity similar to the dipyridamole echocardiography test (71 vs 71%, difference not significant), but a lower specificity (61 vs 90%). It is concluded that the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test is equally feasible but more accurate than the exercise electrocardiography test for noninvasive detection of severe asymptomatic restenosis or disease progression at 1 year after successful coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Silent myocardial ischemia has been inferred from transient ST-segment depression during continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Recently, continuous ambulatory monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function using a radionuclide technique (VEST) has demonstrated episodes of significant silent LV dysfunction in the absence of electrocardiographic changes. To validate the demonstration of silent LV dysfunction with this technique, 12 men were studied during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A total of 18 left anterior descending coronary artery balloon inflations were performed. Balloon inflations at 8 +/- 2 atm (4 to 10 atm) lasted 70 +/- 16 seconds. Seventeen of 18 inflations were associated with a decrease in LV ejection fraction greater than 0.10. Mean LV ejection fraction decreased from 0.53 +/- 0.08 to 0.28 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.0001). In contrast, there was pain in only 10 inflations and ST-segment changes in 7. LV dysfunction was associated with a minimal increase in end-diastolic volume (4 +/- 3%, p less than 0.003), and a major increase in relative end-systolic volume (69 +/- 43%, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that continuous monitoring of LV function with the VEST can sensitively detect silent ischemic decreases in LV function occurring during angioplasty, and provide further validation of the use of this technique for detecting silent myocardial ischemia.\r"

The emergency room admission electrocardiogram was analyzed for ST-segment deviation greater than or equal to 1 mm/lead and T-wave changes. Unfavorable outcomes were recurrent ischemic pain, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization with angioplasty or surgery. In patients who underwent coronary arteriography, a myocardium in jeopardy score ranging from 0 to 10 was assigned, based on the number of vessels with a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 70% and the location of the stenoses. Considering all 90 patients, an admission electrocardiogram with ST-segment deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads had a positive predictive value for adverse clinical events of 79% and a negative predictive value of 64%. In the subset of patients without left ventricular hypertrophy and whose admission electrocardiograms were recorded during chest pain (62 of 90), the positive predictive value of ST deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads improved to 89% and the negative value to 72%.

There was a positive linear correlation between the total number of leads with ST-segment deviation and the myocardium in jeopardy score (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A Medtronic 7216A pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 16 patients (mean age 56 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and organic heart disease with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Endocardial and epicardial defibrillation shock efficacy was evaluated before or at implant using 1 to 3 shock patterns, i.e., monophasic single, sequential or simultaneous shocks with dual and triple electrode configurations. Endocardial leads used a common right ventricular cathode and dual anodes, whereas epicardial leads used 2 or 3 helical coil patches. VT termination was evaluated using pacing or shock therapy, or both, whereas only shocks were used in VF. Programmable bradycardia pacing, individual zones for VT and VF detection and individualized pacing and shock therapy for VT and VF were used. Monophasic shocks had epicardial defibrillation thresholds ranging from 3 to 18 (mean 10) J and were comparable for sequential and simultaneous shocks (p greater than 0.2). VT detection rates ranged from 340 to 470 ms and VF detection rates from 270 to 330 ms. VT or VF induction, or both, was performed noninvasively in 13 patients after implant and was reproducibly terminated by rapid pacing alone (5 patients), low-energy shocks (2 patients), high-energy shocks (3 patients) and combined therapy (3 patients). Intermediate or high-energy shocks terminated all induced VF episodes. During follow-up (2 to 12 months), there have been 2 noncardiac deaths. Electrical therapy was delivered in 7 patients, for VT (3 patients), VT and VF (3 patients) and indeterminate tachyarrhythmia (1 patient). All VT/VF episodes were successfully terminated, with 78 of 96 (81%) spontaneous VT episodes terminated by pacing. Follow-up reprogramming was required in 5 patients. It is concluded that successful application of individualized electrical therapy prescriptions in patients with VT/VF is feasible. Pacing therapies, which are effective for induced VT, can be reliably used for effective long-term spontaneous VT termination in conjunction with shock therapy and can permit reduced patient exposure to shock therapy. Thus, a programmable hybrid pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator system provides nonthoracotomy implantation, effective VT/VF termination, demand ventricular pacing and noninvasive modes for arrhythmia induction, event monitoring and clinical trouble-shooting.\r"

  ".W": "Orthotopic cardiac transplantation is occasionally complicated by unexplained bradyarrhythmias. Sinus node injury as a consequence of operation or acute rejection has anecdotally been linked to the development of bradycardia early after transplantation. These arrhythmias are empirically managed by pacemaker implantation, the indications for which remain poorly defined. This retrospective study examined the 20-year experience of our institution with bradyarrhythmias after transplantation to determine the predisposing factors and indications for pacemaker implantation. Forty-one of 556 patients in our cardiac transplant program (7.4%) received permanent pacemakers between 1969 and 1989. The predominant rhythm disturbances were junctional rhythm (46%), sinus arrest (27%) and sinus bradycardia (17%). Most patients were asymptomatic (61%), and presented in the early post-transplant period (73%). Four possible predisposing factors were evaluated: (1) graft ischemic time, (2) rejection history, (3) use of bradycardia-inducing drugs, and (4) anatomy of blood supply to the sinoatrial (SA) node. No significant differences existed between patients with and without pacemakers with regard to the first 3 variables. However, after transplantation angiograms showed that prevalence of abnormal SA nodal arteries was greater in patients with than without pacemakers (p less than 0.02). Pacemaker follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months showed persistent bradycardia (60 to 90 beats/min) in 88, 75 and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common pacemaker complication (15%) was lead displacement at time of biopsy. These results suggest that disruption of the SA nodal blood supply may be an important predisposing factor in the development of bradycardias.\r"

Ventricular ejection fraction was estimated by radionuclide angiocardiography. Before Fontan surgery, ejection fraction was 0.57 +/- 0.10 (mean +/- standard deviation). This differed significantly from the normal mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.68 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.001) derived in our laboratory by radionuclide angiocardiographic methods. Age, ventricular morphology and the presence of pulmonary artery band or systemic to pulmonary artery shunts had no statistical relation to ventricular ejection fraction in patients with a single ventricle. Serial preoperative evaluation in 15 patients over 3.8 +/- 1.3 years revealed no significant change in ventricular ejection fraction; however, increased atrioventricular valve regurgitation was documented in 4 of these 15. Modified Fontan procedure was performed in 24 of the 47 study patients; 7 have died, 1 has undergone cardiac transplantation and 1 faces possible transplantation. No difference was noted in preoperative ejection fraction between survivors and nonsurvivors. Ventricular morphology, age at Fontan surgery and operative factors such as bypass and cross-clamp time were not related to functional outcome. Preoperative ejection fraction of 0.52 +/- 0.08 decreased to 0.39 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.001) when evaluated 1.16 +/- 0.44 years after Fontan surgery. In patients with a single ventricle (1) ventricular ejection fraction is less than that of the normal systemic ventricle; (2) during childhood, ejection fraction is not related to age or ventricular morphology; and (3) ventricular ejection fraction frequently decreases after a Fontan repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The forward flow velocity pattern was biphasic in 37 of the 53 subjects, with each of the 2 peaks in systole and diastole; flow was triphasic with 2 peaks in systole and the other peak in diastole in the remaining 16 subjects. Peak systolic and diastolic flow velocity ranged from 28 to 84 cm/s and from 27 to 71 cm/s, respectively. Mean systolic flow velocity was significantly greater than mean diastolic flow velocity (53 +/- 12 vs 47 +/- 11 cm/s, p less than 0.01). Systolic flow velocity and the ratio of systolic to diastolic flow velocity increased and diastolic flow velocity decreased with aging (r = 0.52, p less than 0.001, r = 0.70, p less than 0.001 and r = -0.49, p less than 0.001, respectively). Reverse flow occurred during the atrial contraction phase and its velocity (mean 20 cm/s) increased with aging (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001). The parameters of PVFVP were compared with the ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity to peak filling velocity at atrial contraction (E/A ratio) measured in the transmitral flow velocity pattern. As E/A ratio increased, systolic flow velocity and systolic/diastolic flow ratio and peak reverse flow velocity decreased (r = -0.40, p less than 0.01, r = -0.67, p less than 0.001 and r = -0.68, p less than 0.001, respectively) and diastolic flow velocity increased (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Central hemodynamics were assessed by right-sided cardiac catheterization and simultaneous radionuclide angiography. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were calculated from the stroke volume (by direct Fick) and the corresponding left ventricular ejection fraction. Men were larger than women (1.85 +/- 0.11 vs 1.65 +/- 0.13 m2, p less than 0.001) but groups were matched for age (39 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 9 years, p = 0.27). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was higher in men than in women (2.51 +/- 0.50 vs 1.74 +/- 0.30 liters/min, p less than 0.001) but was not different when adjusted for body weight (31.5 +/- 8.1 vs 28.4 +/- 6.4 ml/kg/min, p = 0.14), indicating similar levels of overall fitness in the 2 groups. At rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise, stroke volume and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were higher in men than in women, but there were no intergroup differences in stroke volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic or end-systolic volume indexes. Comparison of derived regression equations of cardiac index, stroke volume index and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes revealed no differences in the time course or magnitude of changes with respect to oxygen consumption, expressed as percentage of peak oxygen consumption, in the 2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, as a noninvasive and high-resolution imaging modality, has been shown to be reliable for determining absolute left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction. A relatively new gradient echo cine NMR approach using 2 orthogonal long-axis planes (2- and 4-chamber) aligned with the true axes of the left ventricle has been previously developed and validated against radiographic biplane LV cineangiography. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the reproducibility of this more rapid cine NMR approach for the measurement of LV volumes and ejection fraction. Eighteen normal subjects underwent 2 cine NMR studies, on different days, using a 1.5-tesla clinical imaging system. Studies were analyzed on-line and blindly by 2 independent observers. Intraobserver error was also determined in a blinded manner. Mean values of measurements determined by this method in this group of normal subjects were end-diastolic volume (120 +/- 20 ml), end-systolic volume (39 +/- 9 ml) and ejection fraction (67 +/- 4%). Paired analysis of data revealed no significant bias between interstudy, interobserver or intraobserver measurements, except for interobserver end-diastolic volume, where the first observer measurements were slightly elevated (5.6 +/- 7.8 ml) compared with the second. This resulted in a small difference in ejection fraction (1.7 +/- 2.3%) between observers. The absolute variation between measurements (square root of variance components) was low for all interstudy, interobserver and intraobserver comparisons: end-diastolic volume was less than +/- 6.7 ml, end-systolic volume less than +/- 3.5 ml and ejection fraction less than +/- 2.4%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 26 influenza virus isolates obtained from 528 clinical specimens, 17 were more efficiently isolated by the centrifugation assay compared with conventional culture methods. Centrifugation-assisted methods were found to be efficient in the recovery of 17 of 20 isolates (85%) not identified on first passage by conventional techniques. The number of isolates obtained with centrifugation was 1.5 times as high as that obtained with no centrifugation after three passages. The two assays were significantly different in the isolation of influenza virus (P less than 0.01). Since low-speed centrifugation may increase the infectivity of influenza virus in cell culture, this technique may prove useful in the efficient and rapid isolation of this virus from clinical specimens.\r"

Twenty-six patients had positive cultures and 27 had H. pylori identifiable in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The gastric biopsy specimens from the 29 patients with culture and/or histologic findings positive for H. pylori showed active gastritis in 27 cases (93%), compared with 26 cases (37%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.0001). Chronic gastritis was present in 25 cases (86%) with H. pylori and 40 cases (56%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.01). Twenty patients had positive Gram-stained smears. Fifteen patients had positive 1-hour urease tests, and 3 had delayed positive 24-hour urease tests. There were no false-positive Gram's stain results, three false-positive 24-hour urease tests, two false-negative histologic results, and three false-negative cultures (one inadvertently incubated anaerobically). The sensitivities of the methods were as follows: 62% for the 24-hour urease test, 69% for direct Gram's stain, 90% for culture, and 93% for histologic examination. The authors conclude that the urease test used in this study has low sensitivity and limited specificity; that the direct Gram-stained smear is a useful, highly specific, rapid screening test; and that the lengthier methods of culture and histologic examination have comparably high sensitivity for the definitive diagnosis of H. pylori gastritis.\r"

Results of the rapid LBC were compared, alone and in combination with the foam stability index (FSI), with the results obtained by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The study used 90 consecutive amniotic fluid specimens from 82 patients. Rank ordering of the data suggested cutoff points of 19,000/microL for the rapid LBC and 46 for the FSI. Statistical analysis indicated that the addition of the LBC improved the sensitivity of the FSI (P less than 0.01 by the McNemar test), although the reverse was not the case (P greater than 0.1). The linearity and reproducibility of the LBC were considered acceptable.\r"

  ".W": "The determination of amniotic fluid lamellar body number density (LBND) has recently been shown to correlate well with other established indicators of fetal lung maturity. The authors have compared the LBND with a fetal lung phospholipid profile in predicting the clinical outcome in 52 well-documented cases. If a cutoff of 30,000/microL was used to indicate fetal lung maturity, there were no false-negative results for the LBND whereas there was one for the fetal lung profile. On the other hand, this cutoff resulted in 22 false-positive results for the LBND, whereas there were only 7 false-positive results by the fetal lung profile. The number of false-positive results by the LBND can be decreased by using a separate cutoff of less than 10,000/microL to indicate high risk for development of respiratory distress, while leaving the cutoff for predicting mature lung at 30,000/microL. This resulted in only four false-positive results for the LBND; each of these were from the same patients who also had false-positive results by the fetal lung profile. Care must be taken to ensure that the particle counter used is properly calibrated and that the appropriate cutoffs for both lung maturity and immaturity are used.\r"

Of these cases, 42 (48%) were immunoblastic (IB), polymorphous subtype; 17 (19%) IB, plasmacytoid; 8 (9%) IB, clear cell; 6 (7%) IB, not otherwise specified; and 15 (17%) DLC-follicular center cell (DLC-FCC) type. Of 34 cases successfully phenotyped from paraffin sections, 13 were T cell and 9 were B cell; of the remaining cases, 8 were suggestive of T-cell lineage, 3 of B-cell lineage, and 1 of histiocytic differentiation. Although histologic subtype did not correlate with clinical features or outcome, it did correlate with immunophenotype among those cases for which lineage could be unequivocally assigned (5 of 18 IB vs. 4 of 4 DLC cases were B cell; P = 0.02) Immunophenotype was also correlated with stage of disease (11 of 13 T-cell vs. 3 of 9 B-cell cases had stage III-IV disease; P = 0.03). (Stage III includes all primary thoracic tumors; stage IV includes all with central nervous system and/or bone marrow involvement.) Significant prognostic features were clinical stage and era (thus type) of therapy (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that most cases of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children are of IB morphologic type, most frequently of T-cell lineage, and those with T-cell phenotype appeared to have more advanced disease.\r"

Primary HD appeared in the stomach (three patients) and the duodenum (one patient); recurrent HD after diagnosis in a conventional nodal site appeared in the stomach (one patient) and the colon (one patient). One of the cases of primary gastric disease was a composite lymphoma consisting of HD and diffuse large cell lymphoma. In view of the rarity of GI tract involvement by HD, a diagnosis of primary GI HD should be viewed with skepticism; support for such a diagnosis may be provided by both classic histopathologic features of HD and immunostaining, but no single feature can be regarded as pathognomonic.\r"

Sternberg-Reed cells or their variants were found adjacent to all of these foci, as well as within some MBC clusters that were free of necrosis. These findings suggest that the presence of necrosis within MBC clusters has diagnostic utility. In two cases, evidence of HD was detected only within MBC clusters and nowhere else. In the third case, HD was found primarily within MBC clusters. These observations imply that HD arose within MBC clusters. Minimal involvement of lymph node by HD can occur within MBC clusters and should be recognized as such on the basis of morphologic features. The earlier a diagnosis of HD can be made, the better is the patient's outlook for survival.\r"

Buffy coat smears were studied that were prepared from the PB of 11 children with documented Bp infection, whose ages ranged from one month to four years. The white blood cell count ranged from 8.4 to 72.9 X 10(9)/L, with a mean of 28.6 X 10(9)/L. In all cases, the percentage of PB lymphocytes was in the normal range; the absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 6.5 to 54.8 X 10(9)/L, with a mean of 20.3 X 10(9)/L. SLCCN represented 12-56% of the lymphocyte population. B and T lymphocytes, identified with monoclonal antibodies with the use of an immunoalkaline phosphatase method, accounted for a mean of 21% and 53%, respectively, of the total nucleated cells (TNCs) on buffy coat smears. The T-helper and T-suppressor subsets represented 38% and 16% of the TNCs, respectively, resulting in a CD4-CD8 ratio of 2.4. Most SLCCN were of the T-helper phenotype; SLCCN of the T-suppressor subset and, rarely, of the B-cell type also were identified. These observations document that the lymphocytosis associated with Bp infection in infants and young children is characterized by the presence of morphologically abnormal cells that are predominantly CD4 positive and appear to represent an expansion of an immunophenotypically normal lymphocyte population.\r"

This study demonstrates that, compared with that of adults, bone marrow of hematologically normal children has an increased percentage of B cells and B-cell precursors. Dual-parameter flow cytometric methods demonstrated subpopulations of B cells at various stages of differentiation; the percentage of cells in these subsets is highest in the very young and decreases with increasing age.

The authors describe the case of a 13-year-old child in whom a remarkable lymphocytosis developed during a period of pancytopenia associated with a febrile syndrome resembling Ehrlichiosis. Most of these lymphoid cells were morphologically similar to large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), but many appeared to be less mature. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated most of these lymphoid cells to be immature T cells at an \"intermediate\" or \"transitional\" stage of thymocyte differentiation characterized by the CD1-CD3+CD4-CD8- phenotype, as well as positivity for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In T-cell ontogeny, this stage represents a transition between thymic precursors and mature thymocytes. Their presence in the peripheral blood of this child is thought to represent a lymphocytic leukemoid response to his infection. Cases such as this may be confused with malignancy.\r"

Size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular involvement were also significant predictors of outcome. Histologically atypical carcinoids with diploid DNA content pursued a less aggressive course than did their aneuploid counterparts.\r"

These proteins were detected by immunoperoxidase techniques in 126 breast carcinomas that had been evaluated clinically for more than six years. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein was present in 58% of the carcinomas, whereas alpha 1-antichymotrypsin was seen in 55% and alpha-lipoprotein in 52%. These markers showed a relationship with clinical outcome. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-lipoprotein were unfavorable determinants, whereas alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein was detected in lesions with a favorable evolution. Taken individually, these markers have similar but rather weak associations with five-year survival rates; roughly 20% of patients in the \"favorable\" group died, compared with 33% in the \"unfavorable\" group. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein in grade 1 tumors was a marker with marginally favorable significance, but alpha 1-antichymotrypsin significantly worsened the prognosis of grade 2 and 3 tumors. Furthermore, stratification of patients according to the number of positive unfavorable markers yielded striking results. Eight percent of patients with none of the unfavorable markers were dead at five years, compared with 55% of those whose lesions expressed three unfavorable markers.\r"

Blood group antigen (BGA) expression in the tumors was determined immunohistochemically and compared with blood type and antigen reactivity in adjacent normal mucosa. A loss of BGA expression was seen in 27 tumors. This finding was correlated with high stage but was not significantly linked to survival. DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissues. Forty-one of 52 tumors were aneuploid, and 14 had two or more separate aneuploid populations. However, survival was not correlated with ploidy status. The degree of differentiation and stage of the tumors were the only two independently significant prognostic indicators in this study.\r"

The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC.\r"

Striking mesangial deposits of both IgA and IgM were found in glomeruli, whereas C3 deposits were absent or present in slight amounts. The light microscopic findings ranged from mild mesangial glomerulonephritis to more advanced forms of sclerosing glomerulopathy. Electron microscopic examination disclosed an increase of mesangial matrix, together with mesangial and paramesangial electron-dense deposits. Two of the patients had microscopic hematuria associated with proteinuria, and one had isolated proteinuria. The authors propose that this group of cases may represent a new subgroup of primary mesangial glomerulonephritis that has not been described previously. They differ immunohistologically from both IgA nephropathy and IgM nephropathy, and therefore could be designated as IgA-IgM nephropathy.\r"

An immunocytochemical (ICC) panel using commercially available antibodies (to carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], B72.3, Leu-M1, cytokeratin [CK], leukocyte common antigen [LCA], S-100 protein, and vimentin) was applied to cell blocks fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution that were from 55 consecutive pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial fluid specimens. The results were correlated with data from clinical records and routine cytologic studies. Final cytologic diagnoses included 26 of adenocarcinoma and 1 of mesothelioma. The remaining 28 cases were considered to be benign (reactive) proliferations. EMA, CEA, B72.3, and Leu-M1 were present in 96%, 77%, 58%, and 42% of adenocarcinomas, respectively. These determinants were absent in the mesothelioma and the reactive effusions, although anti-CEA yielded strong background staining of inflammatory cells. The CK markers identified malignant cells in 93% of cases, but consistently stained mesothelial cells as well. Antivimentin strongly labeled mesothelial cells in all cases, with weak to absent staining of malignant cells. In 3 of 26 carcinoma cases (12%), the ICC panel identified malignant cells that were not recognized initially on routine cytologic examination. In 1 of 26 cases (4%), the panel was falsely negative. Use of this approach can improve the diagnostic accuracy of cytologic examination of serous fluids. The ICC panel is especially helpful when atypical mesothelial proliferation is present, or in cases that are clinically suspect for malignancy, but cytologically negative because there are only a few malignant cells, or those that are cytologically bland.\r"

Because all but one of the lesions were intermediate or high-grade neoplasms, a diagnosis of lymphoma was often possible by conventional light microscopic examination alone. Monotypic light chain expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical techniques in six patients, and positivity for B-cell markers was observed in an additional case. In one instance, two stereotactic biopsy specimens were interpreted as being suggestive of lymphoma, but necrosis and inflammation prevented a definitive diagnosis. Nine patients had no known risk factors for cerebral lymphoma, and the diagnosis often was unsuspected clinically.\r"

The resected gland showed chronic sialadenitis with sialolithiasis and psammoma bodies. In a series of 81 resected nonneoplastic submandibular glands from 72 patients, psammoma bodies, nonlaminated microcalcifications, or both were found in 46 (57%). They were located most commonly just outside of striated or intercalated ducts. When examining fine-needle aspiration specimens from the submandibular gland, it is important that one be aware that psammoma bodies may occur in normal, inflamed, irradiated, and neoplastic conditions.\r"

One hundred forty-six families were included in the final sample, resulting in an 80% response rate. The aims of the survey were to characterize the child's current and past health status, to determine access to and use of medical services, and to determine the serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and tuberculin skin test status of the children. In addition, psychological tests were administered to both child and parent to assess developmental level and psychological problems. Finally, detailed questions were asked concerning the reasons for the homeless condition. The important reasons for homelessness cited in the survey included physical abuse, substance abuse, disagreements with landlords, and poor living conditions. The children's health problems included a high incidence of reported accidents and injuries, burns, and lead toxicity; the parents suffered from depression, physical abuse, and substance abuse. School-aged children tended to have low scores on tests of expressive vocabulary and word decoding, and preschoolers seemed to be below age expectations in receptive vocabulary and visual motor skills. The findings of this study suggest that homeless children tend to score poorly on developmental and psychological tests and tend to sustain serious burns and accidents. Policy implications of the survey include suggestions for health screening, rehabilitation, and education.\r"

  ".W": "The number of children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is rapidly increasing. Most infected children acquire their infection by vertical transmission from an infected mother, and this increase in the number of infected children reflects a similar increase in the number of infected women. Many features of HIV infection in children differ from those in adults, and it is important for the physician to be familiar with the varied presentations of pediatric HIV infection. Transmission of HIV during adolescence, by sexual contact and illicit drug use, is also a growing problem, accounting for most cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) seen in young adults in their 20's. The HIV-infected child represents only one member of a family affected by the HIV virus; frequently, multiple other members of the family are infected as well. These families are predominantly underpriviledged, coming from inner city minority populations with limited access to medical care and social service support. Pediatric AIDS is a preventable disease, by the prevention of HIV infection in women. In short term, it is likely that education will have the greatest impact on altering the course of the AIDS epidemic. Most infected children are cared for in a limited number of public inner city hospitals, and the ability of these hospitals to continue to provide adequate care will be threatened by the rising number of cases. A multidisciplinary approach to providing care for these children and their families is essential, with the primary care physician coordinating this effort. Rapid advances in the treatment of HIV and its associated opportunistic diseases raise difficult questions concerning the access of women, including pregnant women, and children to clinical trials of investigational agents. The commitment of individual health care workers and an increased level of financial support will be necessary to provide the care that these children and their families require and deserve.\r"

  ".W": "Although 95% of children have had a full course of vaccines by the time they enter school, immunization levels among poor inner-city preschoolers may be substantially lower. Among the factors responsible for the disparity are the lack of a uniform data system to identify children who need vaccine; missed opportunities to offer immunizations; overinterpretation of contraindications; and administrative barriers to immunization. Remedies lie in a multifaceted approach: a tracking system that will prompt a reminder and then sound an alarm when an immunization is overdue; means of informing parents, probably best accomplished by an outreach worker of the same racial or ethnic background as the parent; removal of administrative barriers and increased access to services; incentives, either positive or negative, to raise the priority of immunizations; and more education for health care providers to ensure that they understand contraindications and do not miss opportunities to offer vaccines. Other possibilities are \"express lane\" services to immunize all children who come to a health care provider and the delivery of immunizations in child care settings and in programs such as Women, Infants, and Children, and Aid to Families With Dependent Children.\r"

In Michigan, a broad spectrum of groups has studied the issue of the uninsured and, despite the diversity of the groups, arrived at a consensus that providing coverage to uninsured children is an urgent priority. The Caring Program for Children, a private program initiated by Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania to provide primary and preventive health care coverage to children in low-income, uninsured families, gained support from the Michigan legislature and advocacy and provider groups as a means to address the problem. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and the Michigan Department of Social Services joined to expand the Caring Program for Children from a private program to a public-private venture funded by federal and state funds and private donations that has the potential to provide coverage to more than 12,000 children. The Michigan experience may be instructive to other states attempting to devise immediate local solutions to the problem of the uninsured.\r"

It would be of considerable interest to know how the polarized morphology develops during embryogenesis. Both the tubular and glomerular epithelial cells of the kidney develop from mesenchymal stem cells during embryogenesis. A unique conversion of nonpolar cells to polarized epithelial cells thus occurs in the embryonic kidney. This conversion also occurs in vitro if the mesenchymal cells are properly induced. Organ cultures of mesenchymal cells from the mouse embryonic kidney have therefore been much used to study the development of epithelial cell polarity. We have used this model system to study the role of basement membrane glycoproteins in development. The results obtained suggest that laminins are particularly important for epithelial cell development. There are many different types of laminins. Developing kidney tubule cells synthesize a laminin isoform with the chain composition A-B1-B2, and it seems to promote development by interacting with specific integrin receptors on the cell surface. The mesenchymal stem cells also produce laminin B chains, but not the A chain, and they also lack the integrin receptor that interacts with A-B1-B2 laminin.\r"

Among those expressed at especially high levels in the fetal tissue was the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We were able to detect mRNA (by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] amplification) and peptide (by specific radioimmunoassay) for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in fetal kidney, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide was undetectable in midgestation kidney and amniotic fluid.

The overall strategy has been to obtain donor renal tissue from avian and murine embryos and to implant this into the host avian mesonephric mesoderm or into the cortex of murine neonatal kidney. In both models, donor cells were distinguished from the host by the presence of characteristic nuclear or cytoplasmic markers. Examination of quail to chick transplants showed the tandem development of mesonephric tissue in the form of bilobed organ. In the mouse chimeric kidney, examined 2 to 4 weeks postnatally, transplanted metanephric tissue grew and developed glomeruli, proximal tubules, and cords of cells, which extended into the medulla of the host kidney. Before death, intravenous FITC-dextran was administered to the host mouse. Some transplanted tubules were connected to filtering glomeruli, as judged by the presence of fluorescein within their lumens. These experimental models provide novel means with which to study nephrogenesis in vivo. Finally, if the embryonic donor tissue could be genetically engineered before implantation, the prospect of \"nephron therapy\" arises, in which altered implanted nephrons could deliver therapeutically useful molecules into the urine or kidney interstitium.\r"

Renal growth in K depletion nephropathy was studied in culture by reducing the K concentration of the medium, which accelerated cell proliferation. This response appeared to be mediated by release of a growth-promoting activity that has an apparent molecular weight of 12,000 to 30,000. Growth stimulation was also observed when the Na concentration of the medium was reduced and was associated with the appearance of two growth-promoting factors (apparent molecular weight, 6,200 and 9,000) that exhibited cell-type specificity. Thus, modest reductions in the extracellular concentration of K or Na result in rapid appearance of autocrine factors that could modulate cell function along the nephron. The most powerful mitogen for BSC-1 cells is adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This nucleotide stimulates expression of several cell cycle-specific genes and proto-oncogenes, and induces secretion of a platelet-derived growth factor-like protein that is not mitogenic for BSC-1 cells. Release of this growth factor by renal epithelial cells in vivo would represent a paracrine mechanism to initiate proliferation of neighboring stromal or vascular cells.\r"

In the proximal tubule, EGF binding and EGF receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity are localized to basolateral membrane, and functional responses in collecting duct are observed only with basolateral administration of EGF. A number of renal responses to administration of EGF have recently been described, including modulation of glomerular hemodynamics, renal metabolism, tubular transport functions, and eicosanoid synthesis. In addition, EGF has been shown to be a potent mitogen in vitro for a variety of cell types in the kidney and may be an important mediator of renal repair following injury.\r"

Using monolayer epithelial cultures derived from individually microdissected human ADPKD cysts and immunolocalization studies in vivo, the roles of matrix and growth factors in aberrant ADPKD cell proliferation have been studied. Abnormal ADPKD basement membrane ultrastructure was associated with increased turnover of 35S-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) by comparison to normal renal tubule epithelia in vitro. Mitogenic assays demonstrated significant increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation into ADPKD epithelia grown on type I and type IV collagen by comparison to normal proximal straight tubules (PST), collecting ducts, and thick ascending limbs of Henle (TAL). Proliferation on laminin or fibronectin matrices was unchanged and immunolocalization of matrix proteins was polarized and restricted to basal membranes of both ADPKD cysts and renal tubule epithelia in vivo. ADPKD epithelia in vitro were hypersensitive to the mitogenic action of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF immunoreactivity was detected in ADPKD cyst lining epithelia, in cyst fluid, and in conditioned media from confluent ADPKD cultures, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of growth regulation. In addition, inhibition of epithelial proliferation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which was 100% in normal renal tubule epithelia, was reduced to 41% in ADPKD epithelia.\r"

The relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression to the increase in constitutively expressed cellular proteins were examined in mouse kidneys undergoing compensatory growth following unilateral nephrectomy (UNI-NX). Over the 14-day study period, total protein per kidney increased by up to 37%. Northern blot analysis of the expression of the mRNAs for a number of genes associated with cell growth indicated that there was no significant increase in steady-state levels of these selected genes in nephrectomized compared with sham-operated animals. In vitro assays to measure transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes in compensatory growth showed no increase in the rate of transcription. However, transcription of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was increased 24 hours after nephrectomy. Immunoblots of two representative proteins showed that the concentration of these proteins in total kidney protein remained constant in the different experimental groups. Since total protein increased, the concentration of these proteins in the hypertrophied kidney must have increased. Taken together, these data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms may account for the increase in at least some constitutively expressed proteins in cells undergoing compensatory growth.\r"

The transport adaptations are specific or selective, since bicarbonate transport in these CCD is unchanged. Mineralocorticoids may play an important role in the hypertrophy and increased sodium transport, since plasma aldosterone increases early after reduction of renal mass. Also, adrenalectomy abolishes the changes in size and sodium transport, even with supplementation of aldosterone to unstressed physiologic levels. Epidermal growth factor also has immediate effects on CCD sodium transport; however, the direction of the effect is opposite--an inhibition of transport.\r"

In chronic hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, mitochondrial ammoniagenesis is stimulated directly.

Does the lack of insulin, and/or the effect of insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) on renal tubule protein synthesis play a role in diabetic renal hypertrophy? To answer these questions, we determined the rates of 3H-valine incorporation into tubule proteins and the valine-tRNA specific activity, in the presence or absence of insulin and/or IGFI, in proximal tubule suspension isolated from kidneys of streptozotocin diabetic and control rats. The rate of protein synthesis increased, while the stimulatory effects of insulin and IGFI on tubule protein synthesis were reduced, early (96 hours) after induction of experimental diabetes. Thus, hypertrophy of the kidneys in experimental diabetes mellitus is associated with increases in protein synthesis, rather than with decreases in protein degradation. Factor(s) other than the lack of insulin, or the effects of IGFI, must be responsible for the high rate of protein synthesis present in the hypertrophying tubules of diabetic rats.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), kidney weight relative to body weight, thickness of inner stripe of the outer medulla, volume of epithelium in early thick ascending limb, and internephron heterogeneity are all decreased by chronic water diuresis and increased by chronic stimulation of urine concentration. It was further shown that the intrarenal pattern of hypertrophy observed after high protein (HP) intake, but not that observed after compensatory hypertrophy or normal growth with age, is exactly similar to that observed after chronic stimulation of urine concentration. Since solute-free water reabsorption (TcH2O) is markedly enhanced by HP diet, this suggests that the increases in GFR and renal mass observed after HP intake are, at least in part, an adaptive response of the kidney to increased urinary concentrating activity. The beneficial effects are induced by protein restriction in chronic renal failure (CRF) could thus be due, in part, to the reduction of this concentrating activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by an experiment performed in rats with experimental chronic renal failure (CRF) in which a chronic increase in water intake, reducing urine osmolality and TcH2O, without any change in food composition or consumption, reduced proteinuria, systemic hypertension, kidney hypertrophy, incidence of glomerulosclerosis, and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Primary renal disease of immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms induces loss of substantial nephron population. It is presumed that the initial loss of functioning nephrons causes alterations of function and metabolism in remnant nephrons, which per se are self-inflictive, leading to further loss of nephrons. The ultimate outcome of this vicious cycle is the end-stage kidney. The potential role of various pathophysiologic mechanisms has been explored. These studies have shown a tight link between glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Analysis of individual glomeruli show a biphasic pattern of these two parameters. Early development of glomerular sclerosis takes place along with the hypertrophy of the glomerulus, and further advancement of sclerosis occurs with shrinkage in glomerular size. Thus, we propose that, after initial nephron loss, the remnant glomeruli are exposed to increased growth-promoting factors, which are self-inflictive in nature due to their capacity to produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix in the mesangial area. When the excessive matrix obliterates the glomerular capillary lumen, a typical sclerotic lesion appears. This is a vicious and accelerating process, since sclerosis induces further reduction in the nephron population, thereby imposing greater influence of growth-promoting factors even on glomeruli that are initially resistant.\r"

  ".W": "The role of glomerular endothelium has been barely considered, let alone investigated, but this is in large part due to the extreme difficulty in isolating and growing it in culture. The glomerular capillary is part of the arterial system and is better perceived as a \"hemiarteriole.\" The mesangium and its response to hemodynamic events in the glomerular capillary is equivalent to the smooth muscle cell wall of an arteriole. The capability of cytokines, derived from the endothelium, to act in an autocrine and paracrine manner is clearly demonstrated by angiogenesis. The glomerular endothelial cell is likely to play a crucial role in the glomerulus in health and disease.\r"

  ".U": "91253610\r", 
  ".W": "Mesangial cell proliferation constitutes a frequent finding in a number of glomerular diseases that progress to glomerular sclerosis. The factors responsible for mesangial cell growth regulation in vivo are ill defined. However, cell culture data indicate that an array of mediators may have mitogenic or antimitogenic effects on these cells. This brief review discusses the relevance of selected factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in this context. In vitro data indicate that PDGF is one of the most potent mesangial cell mitogens, that it may have autoregulatory properties, and that it may represent the final common pathway for a number of other mitogenic peptides. In contrast to PDGF, the relevance of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) for mesangial cell proliferation is less evident, with growth-inhibitory to weakly growth-promoting effects on mesangial cells. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) appears to be unique in that it has a concentration-dependent mitogenic or antimitogenic effect on mesangial cells. Prostaglandins may also have variable effects, ranging from mitogenic (PGE2 alpha) to growth inhibitory (PGI2, PGF2, TxA2). These data support the notion that mesangial cell growth in vivo is regulated by a complex network of synergistic or antagonistic growth factors. The relative importance of each of these growth factors in the in vivo situation will have to be elucidated by future studies using specific receptor antagonists or neutralizing antibodies.\r"

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a growth-promoting peptide likely to play a role in the development of kidney growth. We observed an increased renal IGF-I content in two experimental models of accelerated kidney growth in the rat. By contrast, diabetic renal hypertrophy is abolished in the absence of growth hormone (GH). Dietary protein manipulations affect the expression of compensatory renal growth (CRG), as well as renal IGF-I content. The renotrophic effect of a high-protein diet on CRG seems GH-dependent and IGF-I-mediated. GH also appears to have a permissive role on the development of progressive renal scarring following extensive renal ablation in rats, as dwarf rats seem somewhat resistant to the development of accelerated scarring and renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it has been shown that inflammatory and noninflammatory glomerular diseases are often complicated by changes in the tubulointerstitial system, mostly caused by renal interstitial fibrosis (IF). To analyze pathomechanisms of these tubulointerstitial lesions, growth behavior and expression of cell surface molecules of tubular epithelial cells and renal fibroblasts in culture, established using renal biopsies of IF, were studied. Furthermore, the capacity of renal fibroblasts in culture to produce extracellular matrix was investigated. Expression of MHC-class II antigens on proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) has been induced by supplementing the culture medium with interferon gamma. Renal fibroblasts, the major cell types growing out from renal biopsies with interstitial fibrosis, form so-called hillocks in culture and synthesize collagen type I, III, and V. Further analysis using cocultures of tubular epithelial or renal endothelial cells on the one hand, and defined renal fibroblasts on the other, will clarify the interaction between these cell types, which probably will lead to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms causing disease progression.\r"

Furthermore, FKIF cells synthesize four to five times more total collagen per cell as compared with NKF cells, and the relative amounts of the collagen types produced (type I, III, and V) are significantly different from controls. Thus, the in vitro cell system of FKIF cells may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering the induction and progression of renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo.\r"

Of these, 28 patients were treated with oral prednisolone (PSL) at 1 mg/kg/d for from 4 to 8 weeks depending on their response, followed by PSL, at gradually tapering doses for 1 year. Five severely nephrotic patients received 1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously (IV) for 3 days, followed by 40 mg/d oral PSL for 4 to 8 weeks and finally PSL in gradually reduced doses. Sixteen patients (48%) were free of proteinuria within 4 weeks, and 25 (76%) within 8 weeks. Two patients required cyclophosphamide for induction of remission. Age at presentation was not significantly correlated with response time to corticosteroid therapy. Thirty-two (97%) went into remission, and relapse occurred in 11 (34%) of these. As assessed by the life-table method, 84% of patients were still in remission at 6 months after induction of remission, 75% after 1 year, and 63% during the follow-up period (mean, 47.1 +/- 29.1 months; range, 6 to 123 months). Incidence of relapse was not correlated with remission induction time, ie, earlier (less than or equal to 4 weeks) or later (greater than 4 weeks), but was greater in younger (less than 30 years of age) patients than older (greater than or equal to 30 years) patients (P less than 0.03).

We studied patients treated with low-dose CsA, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin ([ALG] n = 205) versus conventional (three-drug) immunosuppression (n = 368) and evaluated the impact of CsA, acute rejection episodes, and other clinical parameters on serum lipids.

In a cross-over study, subjects were given either calcium citrate, 950 mg four times a day, or placebo during the 3 days of aluminum hydroxide ingestion (2.4 g/d). Plasma aluminum levels were measured on the second control day and the third day of aluminum hydroxide ingestion. Baseline urinary aluminum excretion was 0.02 +/- 0.004 (6.5 +/- 1.1 micrograms/g creatinine) and 0.03 +/- 0.005 mumol/mmol creatinine (7.4 +/- 1.3 micrograms/g creatinine). These values increased during aluminum hydroxide therapy, but values were much greater when calcium citrate was ingested with aluminum hydroxide. On 3 consecutive days, urinary aluminum excretion levels were 11.1 +/- 3.23, 8.8 +/- 2.9, and 5.3 +/- 0.7 times greater during the administration of calcium citrate with aluminum hydroxide than with aluminum hydroxide alone. Plasma aluminum levels did not differ in the two treatment groups.

The 327 readmissions, including 42 patients who were readmitted more than once during the study period, accounted for 12% of medical admissions. Nearly 75% of readmissions were due to previously diagnosed medical conditions; complications of drugs or therapeutic procedures caused 29%, and patient compliance contributed to 11%. Three reviewers judged 28 (9%) readmissions to be potentially preventable. These 28 readmissions constituted 1% of all admissions to the medical service and did not result in any fatalities, indicating that the quality of care was generally very good. One third of the potentially preventable readmissions were thought to be related to medical system failures, one third to an unfulfilled hope that the patient would improve after discharge, and one third to other suboptimal judgements in evaluation or treatment. Of the 28 potentially preventable readmissions, 89% occurred within 10 days of discharge. We conclude that potentially preventable readmissions would nearly always be detected by review of readmissions within 10 days of discharge and that many may be amenable to systematic interventions such as standardized predischarge assessment and better coordination of post-discharge follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine whether former intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) demonstrate reductions in pulmonary function, especially in the diffusing capacity (DLCO), after adjustment for the effects of their ubiquitous smoking habit. Knowledge of baseline DLCO in this high-risk group is important in evaluating the effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and ensuing opportunistic infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements of single-breath DLCO, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were compared with predictive values that adjust for the effects of smoking. Patients were 98 ambulatory former IVDAs regularly attending a methadone maintenance program (62 men and 36 women; 94 current smokers, two ex-smokers, and two nonsmokers). RESULTS: When adjusted for smoking, FEV1 and DLCO were no different in the study sample than in cross sections of the general population: mean FEV1 105% predicted (men) and 97% predicted (women), mean DLCO 95% predicted (men) and 99% predicted (women). Eleven percent of the IVDAs had abnormal values for DLCO; only one subject had a value less than 50% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Most former IVDAs who regularly attend an ambulatory methadone program have normal DLCO values when the effects of smoking are taken into account. A decrease in DLCO in such subjects is presumptive evidence of superimposed disease, most likely related to opportunistic infections or HIV-associated malignancy or alveolitis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To retrospectively study the prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients and to relate the frequency of this fungal disease to any causal or modifying factors that could be identified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1977 and 1988, 130 patients underwent 158 intensive treatment episodes to control acute leukemia, lymphoma, and aplastic anemia, and the frequency of complicating aspergillus infection was determined. RESULTS: Proven invasive aspergillus infections occurred in 22 cases, 12 of which were fatal. Invasive aspergillosis was suspected in a further 16 cases and all these patients recovered with amphotericin B treatment. Colonization by Aspergillus in the absence of clinically significant infection was seen in 31 treatment episodes. Invasive aspergillosis involved mainly the upper and lower respiratory tract and skin. Control of the infection was closely related to the control of the underlying disease, with subsequent return of normal marrow function and resolution of neutropenia. The incidence of aspergillus infection has decreased dramatically since 1985, most probably due to the introduction of intranasal amphotericin B. This occurred despite the persistence of aspergillus spores in the hematology ward air during the 1986 to 1988 period. CONCLUSION: Intranasal aerosolized amphotericin B may protect against invasive aspergillosis, even when neutropenic patients are cared for in conventional wards without HEPA filtration.\r"

DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Because the secretory diarrhea of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the gut induces serious metabolic and nutritional disturbances, this study was initiated to assess the use of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, as adjunctive therapy for severe GvHD of the gut with massive diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a pilot study, six patients with biopsy-confirmed acute gut GvHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation received octreotide 50 to 250 micrograms three times a day subcutaneously. RESULTS: Three of the six treated patients had a prompt and dramatic reduction in stool volume within 1 to 3 days of initiation of octreotide therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Somatostatin and its analogues have been used successfully in diarrheal states by antagonism of neuropeptide overproduction, although other potential therapeutic mechanisms include inhibition of fluid secretion, enhanced salt absorption, and inhibition of gut motility. Somatostatin and its analogues may be promising adjunctive agents in the treatment of gastrointestinal GvHD, although assessment in a controlled trial will be required to confirm their therapeutic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of liver toxicity from the long-term administration of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of 15 studies examining the relationship between long-term, low-dose methotrexate administration and biopsy evidence of liver fibrosis. PATIENTS: A total of 636 patients from 15 studies. RESULTS: The incidence of progression of liver disease (defined as worsening of at least one grade on the histologic classification of Roenigk) among 636 patients was 27.9% (95% confidence intervals 24.3 to 31.6). The rate of progression of liver disease in the 15 studies was associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.01). Patients on average had a 6.7% (95% confidence intervals 2.1 to 11.4) chance of progressing at least one histologic grade on liver biopsy for each gram of methotrexate taken. The overall incidence of advanced pathologic changes on liver biopsy (grades IIIB or IV) among 636 patients was 5.0% (95% confidence intervals 3.5 to 7.0). The development of advanced histologic changes was not associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.08). Patients who according to their history were heavy drinkers (at least 100 g of alcohol per week) were more likely to have advanced changes on liver biopsy (17.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.0003) and to show histologic progression (73.3% versus 25.9%, p = 0.0002). Patients with psoriasis were more likely than patients with rheumatoid arthritis to have advanced changes (7.7% versus 2.7%, p = 0.003) and histologic progression (33.1% versus 24.3%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of liver toxicity in patients undergoing long-term, low-dose methotrexate therapy is substantial, and that risk increases with the total cumulative dose and with heavy consumption of alcohol. Heavy users of alcohol should not receive long-term methotrexate therapy. For most patients who are not heavy users of alcohol, liver biopsies should be done periodically to monitor for the occurrence of liver toxicity.\r"

  ".U": "91253654\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was compared in elderly patients and younger patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Clinical characteristics, surgical complications, and long-term survival rates were compared between the two age groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 54 elderly patients (greater than 65 years) and 79 younger patients (less than 65 years) who had had AICDs implanted for recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: In 85% of elderly patients and 78% of younger patients, coronary artery disease was the underlying disease (NS). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.4 +/- 14.3% in the elderly patients and 35.7 +/- 17.6% in the younger patients (NS). Concomitant myocardial revascularization was performed in 37% of elderly patients and 29% of younger patients (NS); however, only 4% of elderly patients had concomitant left ventricular resection or cryoablation, compared with 15% of younger patients (p less than 0.001). Two patients in each age group died perioperatively (4% versus 3%, NS), and no significant difference in surgical morbidity or length of hospital stay following AICD implantation was noted between the age groups. In conjunction with AICD, elderly patients more commonly received antiarrhythmic drugs, with 54% of elderly patients taking amiodarone at the time of hospital discharge compared with 29% of the younger patients (p less than 0.008). In contrast, beta-blockers were more commonly used in younger patients (16% versus 2%, p less than 0.03). At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 11 (20%) elderly patients and 16 (20%) younger patients had died. Six deaths in elderly patients and five deaths in younger patients were classified as arrhythmic deaths (NS); however, only one younger patient and three elderly patients died suddenly (NS). Calculated survival curves demonstrated similar survival rates in the two age groups with approximately 90%, 87%, and 80% of the patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Theoretic survival curves calculated from appropriate AICD shocks demonstrated significantly lower survival compared with actual survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AICD is a very effective treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and this benefit applies to elderly patients as well as younger patients.\r"
