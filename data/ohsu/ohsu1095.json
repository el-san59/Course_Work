  ".W": "Homeobox proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins initially implicated in the control of gene expression in developing tissues; however, there is increasing evidence that these proteins are important in gene regulation in adult tissues. A cDNA for the homeobox gene HOX-2.3 was isolated from an adult human B-lymphocyte cDNA library. Northern blot analysis showed expression of a 1.1 and a 1.6 kb messenger RNA (mRNA) in a human B-cell line. RNase protection assays demonstrated variable expression in both human B- and T-cell lines. Virally transformed and nontransformed lymphocyte cell lines expressed HOX-2.3 transcripts. Essentially no transcripts were found in unactivated normal B and T lymphocytes; however, B-cell activation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or T-cell activation with phytohemagglutinin and PMA were accompanied by a rapid induction of HOX-2.3 expression even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. In situ hybridization was performed to examine HOX-2.3 expression in lymphoid tissues. HOX-2.3 mRNA was detected in the thymic cortex from an 8-year-old child, in the germinal centers in adult tonsil, and in a limited number of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow. These findings suggest the involvement of HOX-2.3 in regulating gene transcription not only in developing tissues but in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues as well.\r"

  ".W": "A new human leukemia cell line, designated as ME-1, was established from the peripheral blood leukemia cells of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (M4E0). This cell line has the characteristic chromosome abnormality of M4E0, inv(16) (p13q22). When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, ME-1 cells were monoblastoid, but with the addition of cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, or medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral leukocytes (PHA-LCM), the cells exhibited differentiation to macrophage-like cells. PHA-LCM also promoted eosinophilic-lineage differentiation of this cell line, although IL-5 did not do so. To elucidate the mechanism of proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells, we studied the effect of a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), on colony formation of ME-1 cells. H-7 inhibited colony formation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF dose dependently, but had little inhibitory effect on colony formation by IL-4. These results indicate that the proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF were related to the activation of protein kinase C, while those by IL-4 involved other regulatory systems. ME-1 cells should be useful for studying the pathogenesis of M4E0 and the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of leukemic and normal progenitors by cytokines.\r"

Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL.\r"

  ".W": "Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 622 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and successful G-banding chromosome studies disclosed seven cases with the t(11;14)(p13;q11) and one with the t(11;14)(p15;q11). Leukemia cells in all eight cases had a T-cell immunophenotype. The t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurred in 6.8% and the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in 1% of T-cell ALL cases (n = 103). The t(11;14) was associated with presenting clinical features typical of T-cell ALL: male predominance (n = 6), age greater than 10 years (n = 3), hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, n = 5), relatively high hemoglobin level (median, 10.8 g/dL), high serum lactic dehydrogenase level (median, 3248 U/L), presence of mediastinal mass (n = 6), and central nervous system leukemia (n = 2). While there were no significant differences in presenting features between T-cell ALL cases with or without the t(11;14), leukemic cells from patients with the translocations were more likely to coexpress CD4 and CD8 antigens (6 of 6 v 35 of 86 cases tested, P less than .05). Adverse events have occurred in six patients: three central nervous system relapses [including the one with t(11;14)(p15;q11)], two secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and one hematologic relapse. Our results indicate that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurs exclusively in T-cell malignancies of intermediate- or late-stage thymocyte differentiation. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of these translocations.\r"

  ".U": "91300106\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) on a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-dependent human myeloblastic leukemic cell line, OCI-AML1a, was investigated. IL-4 suppressed the clonogenic cell growth in methylcellulose culture, inhibited the uptake of 3H thymidine in a dose-dependent manner at 5 to 100 U/mL, and consequently suppressed the growth of clonogenic cells in short- and long-term suspension cultures. In addition, IL-4 markedly increased the number of adherent cells. These adherent cells were alpha-naphthyl-butyrate (alpha-NB) esterase-positive and showed macrophage-like appearance, increased expression of CD14, CD11b, CD23, and Ia, and significantly decreased clonogenicity. On the other hand, nonadherent cells growing in suspension showed only slight increase in proportion of alpha-NB esterase-positive or monocyte/macrophage-like cells and increased CD23 expression by an addition of IL-4. The clonogenicity of the nonadherent cells was not significantly influenced by IL-4. By addition of the media conditioned by OCI-AML1a cells in the presence of IL-4, the clonogenic cells growth of OCIAML1a cells was suppressed and adherent cells were markedly increased. The suppressive and differentiative effects on OCI/AML1a cells of the conditioned media and IL-4 itself were almost completely abolished by anti-IL-4 antibody. Furthermore, the neutralizing antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-6 did not influence the effect of recombinant IL-4. Taken together, IL-4 was shown to suppress the growth and induce differentiation toward adherent macrophage-like cells of the G-CSF-dependent myeloblastic cell line. The effect of IL-4 may be direct, and not secondary via inducing production of other cytokines such as TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, or IL-6 by leukemic cells.\r"

A B-cell origin was confirmed by the expression of CD19 and HLA-DR. Four stages of B-cell leukemias were defined: stage I (pro-B) as CD10-, cytoplasmic mu- (c mu-), surface Ig- (sIg-); stage II (cALL) as CD10+/c mu-/sIg-; stage III (pre-B) as CD10+ or -/c mu+/sIg-; and stage IV (B) as CD10-/c mu-/sIg+. A linear correlation was found between immunohistochemical and radiochemical determination of 5'NT (r = .86). 5'NT expression was low in T-cell leukemias and stage I, high in stages II and III, and low again in stage IV of B-cell leukemias. 5'NT expression was not related to c mu, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, but was significantly related to CD10 and inversely related to kappa/lambda expression. However, the 5'NT activity in CD10+ leukemias (stages II and III) shows a very wide range. Within the group of CD10+ leukemias no differences were detected between 5'NT+ and 5'NT- cells in their expression of other B-cell antigens. We conclude that the place of 5'NT in leukemias corresponding to early stages of B-cell development has been characterized. 5'NT is expressed in CD10+ stages and decreases before the expression of sIgs. Future studies should make clear whether a high expression of this enzyme in CD10+ stages is a normal maturation phenomenon or a malignant phenomenon.\r"

Previous studies have suggested an association between t(11;14) chromosomal translocations and bcl-1 rearrangement in centrocytic and related intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas. To further characterize the association between bcl-1 and centrocytic lymphoma, Southern blot analysis was performed on samples from 23 patients using four separate bcl-1 breakpoint probes spanning 63 kb of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Rearrangements were identified in six patients with the major translocation cluster (MTC) probe and in another six with probe p94PS, located about 24 kb 5' of MTC. Eleven of these 12 cases showed comigration of rearranged bcl-1 and Ig heavy chain-joining genes, consistent with the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation. No rearrangements were observed with the bcl-1 locus probes p210 or p11EH located 5' of p94PS, nor with bcl-2 or c-myc oncogene probes. No bcl-1 rearrangements were identified in B-cell follicular NHL (15), small noncleaved cell (Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's) NHL (8), T-cell NHL (4), multiple myeloma (14), and pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (9). One of 23 B-cell NHL of large cell type and one of 19 chronic lymphocytic leukemias or small lymphocytic NHL had MTC rearrangement. Thus, bcl-1 rearrangement occurred at MTC or p94PS in 12 of 23 centrocytic lymphomas (52%), confirming a nonrandom association and suggesting a pathogenetic role for the bcl-1 locus in this immunohistologic subtype of NHL.\r"

A cDNA for one of the monocytic enzyme variants (HMSE1) was cloned from a U-937 lambda gt11 cDNA library by screening with an oligonucleotide mixture designed according to amino acid sequence data of the purified enzyme. The cDNA contains 1,727 bp with an open reading frame of 1,512 bp coding for a protein of 503 amino acid residues. HMSE1 cDNA represents the first cloned monocyte/macrophage-specific serine esterase and its sequence shows up to 77% homology to other known serine esterases of different species. The amino acid composition of the putative active site of HMSE1 as deduced from the nucleotide sequence corresponds with the active sites of other serine esterases but not with the active sites of serine proteases.

The high numbers of peritoneal macrophages presumably result from an influx of blood monocytes into the peritoneum, and/or from local proliferation of peritoneal macrophages. Once in the peritoneal cavity, monocytes differentiate into tissue macrophages. Mononuclear phagocyte proliferation and differentiation are influenced by different cytokines, including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of M-CSF levels in human PF and plasma to the macrophage content, and to the patient diagnoses. Mean concentrations of PF M-CSF were higher than plasma levels (2.44 +/- 0.13 v 0.95 +/- 0.06 ng/mL, respectively). The mean concentrations of plasma M-CSF did not differ in samples from women of different diagnostic groups (normal, peritoneal adhesions, endometriosis, inactive pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine fibroids, and idiopathic infertility), but the PF concentration was slightly higher in normal women. The absolute (total) amount of PF M-CSF in normal women was lower than in those of the other diagnostic groups. The total amount of PF M-CSF in all women correlated closely with the total number of peritoneal macrophages. The tubal patency status (open versus closed) did not influence the plasma and PF concentrations of M-CSF, nor the PF absolute amount of M-CSF. The PF M-CSF may have come from peritoneal macrophages, fibroblasts, mesothelial cells, or endothelial cells. PF M-CSF may play important roles in the proliferation and/or the differentiation of peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Spectrin Nice (beta 220/216) is a spectrin variant associated with a shortened beta chain found in a patient with elliptocytosis. The shortened beta chain (beta' chain) appeared as an additional band of approximately 216 Kd on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was defective in its ability to be phosphorylated. There were increased amounts of spectrin dimers in crude spectrin extracts from the propositus and the association constant of spectrin dimer self-association was decreased. There was an associated increase of the alpha I 74-Kd fragment from the alpha chain after partial trypic digestion of spectrin. To identify the underlying molecular defect, we analyzed cDNA for beta spectrin obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed reticulocyte messenger RNA from peripheral blood of the propositus. DNA sequencing of individual as well as pooled subclones showed that two extra bases (GA) are inserted in codon no. 2046 in one allele of the beta-spectrin gene. The insertion results in a frameshift mutation and generates an aberrant C-terminus truncated by about 4 Kd, consistent with the estimated size of the beta' chain observed. By allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, the insertion was shown to be present in the propositus and absent in his parents, confirming a previous proposal that it is a de novo mutation. The determination of the location of the mutation in spectrin Nice points to specific regions of the beta-spectrin chain where phosphorylation may occur. A model is proposed to describe the interaction between the alpha- and beta-spectrin chains and to explain the effects of the mutation found in spectrin Nice on the trypsin digestion pattern of its associated alpha chain.\r"

We have been studying the mechanisms responsible for attenuation of MHC class I gene expression in an H-2 heterozygous (H-2b x H-2d) Abelson-Murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed leukemic cell line (designated R8). Here we report that treatment of the R8 cell line with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) increased H-2Kb steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels several fold. The induced H-2Kb mRNA transcripts were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to be translated into immunoprecipitable H-2Kb alloantigen. H-2Kb null variants derived from the R8 cell line were shown to be the product of both cis- and trans-acting mechanisms, insomuch as the treatment of R8-derived H-2Kb non-expressor lines with CHX re-established expression of H-2Kb mRNA to the same extent as transfection of the variant cell line with the wild-type H-2Kb gene. Such findings indicate that downregulation of MHC class I gene expression is constitutive for the R8 leukemic cell line, a phenomenon that may be related to the immature pre-B-cell phenotype of this A-MuLV transformant.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective two year screening survey. SETTING--Regional paediatric cardiology service, Northern Ireland. PATIENTS--81 newborn infants with Down's syndrome born in Northern Ireland between November 1987 and November 1989. INTERVENTIONS--Clinical examination, chest radiography, and electrocardiography soon after birth followed by cross sectional Doppler echocardiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic ability of clinical examination, radiography, and electrocardiography compared with echocardiographic findings. RESULTS--34 babies had congenital heart disease detected by echocardiography (13 had atrioventricular septal defects, seven secundum atrial septal defects, six a solitary patent ductus arteriosus, five isolated ventricular septal defects, and three combinations of heart defects). Individual examination methods were insensitive (the sensitivity of clinical examination was 0.53, of radiography 0.44, and of electrocardiography 0.41) but highly specific (the specificity of clinical examination was 0.94, of radiography 0.98, and of electrocardiography 1.0), although sensitivity improved when the three techniques were combined (the sensitivity was 0.71, the specificity 0.91). CONCLUSION--Echocardiography performed early in life can detect congenital heart disease that might otherwise be missed. Early detection may help prevent complications such as pulmonary vascular disease that may adversely affect the outcome of cardiac surgery.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To describe the epidemiology of cerebrovascular events in patients given or not given fibrinolytic treatment and to assess the prognostic implications and risk factors. DESIGN--Case series derived from the GISSI randomised trial. SETTING--176 coronary care units in Italy giving various levels of care. PATIENTS--5860 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 1.5 million units of intravenous streptokinase and 5852 patients not given fibrinolytic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cerebrovascular event, sex, age, blood pressure, history of previous infarct, site of infarction, and Killip class. RESULTS--99 of 11,712 patients (0.84%) had a cerebrovascular event. Older age, worse Killip class, and anterior location of infarction seemed to be risk factors for cerebrovascular events (40/3201 aged 65-75 v 42/7295 aged less than 65, odds ratio 2.18; 9/437 class 3 v 55/8277 class 1, 1.81; and 57/4878 anterior v 24/4013 posterior, 1.96). No significant difference was found in the rate of cerebrovascular events between patients treated with streptokinase and controls (45/5852 (0.92%) streptokinase v 54/5860 (0.77) control). More patients in the streptokinase group than in the control group had cerebrovascular events (especially haemorrhagic strokes) on day 0-1 after randomisation (27 streptokinase v 7, control), although this was balanced by late events in control patients (54 streptokinase v 45 control at one year). The mortality of patients who had a cerebrovascular event was higher than that of those who did not (47% (47/99) v 11.6% (1350/11,613]. CONCLUSIONS--Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events complicating myocardial infarction was low, they increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with streptokinase did not significantly alter the incidence, but age and poor haemodynamic state were associated with an increased risk.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients and their household contacts. SETTING--Royal Children's Hospital (the major paediatric hospital) in Victoria, Australia, with catchment population of 4.2 million, including 300,000 children aged under 5 years. SUBJECTS--234 patients (age range 6 weeks to 8 years) with 235 episodes of all types of invasive H influenzae type b disease admitted during 1988-9 and their contacts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Positive cultures of H influenzae type b from throat swabs taken at admission and six weeks subsequently; recording of rifampicin prophylaxis. RESULTS--The percentage of patients with positive throat cultures fell from 69% (33/48) on day 1 of admission to 9% (4/47) after three days' treatment; at six weeks' follow up 32% (32/99) of patients who had not received rifampicin and 8% (5/61) who had, had positive throat cultures. Among household contacts, 33% (62/190) of children and 7% (25/359) of adults were colonised, and the colonisation rates were similar in contacts of patients with all types of H influenzae type b disease. Rifampicin prophylaxis was indicated in 85 families; in 34% it was not prescribed at all for contacts and in 41% not as recommended. The colonisation rates at follow up were significantly less in siblings given rifampicin (12%, 9/78), particularly in families in which all members were treated (3%), than in those in which they were not (36%) (odds ratio 21.5; 95% confidence interval 3.0 to 103.4). CONCLUSIONS--The rate of throat colonisation with H influenzae type b was similar among siblings of children with all types of invasive H influenzae type b disease. Colonisation in contacts can be reduced by rifampicin prophylaxis, but some contacts remained colonised or were recolonised by the time of follow up. Medical staff complied poorly with current recommendations for rifampicin prophylaxis, which reduces its intrinsically limited value in preventing H influenzae type b disease.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective questionnaire survey completed by consultants on each patient seen during October 1989 to May 1990. SETTING--Outpatient pain clinics of five teaching and five district general hospitals in Scotland and northern England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of new referrals and their source, and characteristics of pain at presentation. RESULTS--4354 forms were completed by 21 consultants over 29 weeks, corresponding to 2241 patients, of whom 981 were new referrals. The proportion of consultations at which new referrals were seen varied among the 10 clinics from 15% to 34%. The difference could not be accounted for by type of hospital. Sources of new referrals varied widely between the clinics (for example, range 22% to 78% for general practitioner referrals), as did new referrals by the type of pain (range 10.8% to 55.2% for low back pain, 10.5% to 32.5% for pain associated with surgery). However, these differences in types of patients seen could not be accounted for by variations in referral patterns among clinics. Problems identified in performing an audit of outpatients included the difficulty of obtaining firm diagnoses, the need for a method to link successive patient contacts, and the complexity of the presenting problem in many patients. CONCLUSIONS--It is possible to collect data for audit routinely in outpatient clinics. Observation of current practice in the clinics suggested possible unmet need or inappropriate management, which may require changes in practice.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective review by a chest physician and audit assistant of a random sample of 76 case records of patients by a criterion based questionnaire developed from hospital guidelines on management of acute asthma. SETTING--One district general hospital. PATIENTS--76 adult patients with acute asthma: 38 admitted with a relevant primary diagnosis between April 1988 and March 1989 and a further 38 admitted through the accident and emergency department between April 1989 and March 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Conformity with recognised standards for assessment and management of acute asthma before and after the audit and by chest physicians and general physicians. RESULTS--Age and sex did not differ significantly between the different groups of patients. Overall, deviations from the guidelines occurred in recording measures of severity of asthma, emergency treatment with beta 2 agonists (60/76, 79%) and steroids (43/76, 57%), and prescription of antibiotics in accordance with at least one criterion of the guidelines (29/45, 64%). Chest physicians were more rigorous than general physicians in recording severity measures, especially serum potassium concentration (chi 2 = 3.6, df = 1, p = 0.06), emergency steroid treatment within the correct period (chi 2 = 3.9, df = 1, p = 0.05), and referral for follow up at an outpatient chest clinic. Recording of arterial blood gas tensions improved significantly between the 1988-9 and 1989-90 samples (chi 2 = 7.0, df = 1, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS--The questionnaire proved easy to use for both doctor and audit assistant. The audit improved few standards of care and emphasises the need for further reinforcement and feedback.\r"

  ".U": "91300221\r", 
  ".W": "The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease demands a quick, reliable, non-invasive technique for initial assessment. We have devised a new method which combines the two physical principles that (1) Doppler shift is proportional to blood velocity and (2) blood velocity is inversely proportional to arterial cross-section with the ability to track probe position using a non-contacting method. An image of the probe track and any arterial narrowing is shown superimposed on an outline of the patient. Pressure measurement, scan and graphics with final report take about 20 minutes. The accuracy of this system in peripheral vascular disease was evaluated. Thirty-one patients underwent quickscan (QS) and arteriography within an average time of 7 days. Abdominal aorta, common iliac-common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal artery segments were graded independently as normal, significant stenosis (greater than 50% of diameter) or occluded by both techniques. Of 197 segments, QS correctly assessed 106 normal, 22 stenosed and 28 occluded segments. Four equivocal angiographic stenoses were normal on QS and three severe stenoses were graded occlusion. Fifteen segments on angiography and five on QS were not assessed. For the iliac and superficial femoral artery segments, sensitivity and specificity averaged 77% and 86%, respectively, for all grades. Aortic statistics were invalid (only one significant lesion). Six out of eight popliteal occlusions were correctly diagnosed by QS, but no popliteal stenoses were detected out of six shown on arteriography. Low numbers may contribute to this discrepancy but an improved popliteal scanning method may be necessary. We find initial QS an invaluable aid to direct percutaneous angiography and to indicate potential sites for angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The aetiology of splenomegaly is seldom clear from either clinical or imaging assessment of the spleen. In the majority of cases sonographic assessment of the spleen produces a homogeneous enlargement of variable echodensity, but with very poor correlation with pathology. A study has been undertaken to assess the Doppler characteristics of the splenic artery in splenomegaly, excluding cases of portal hypertension in an attempt to provide further diagnostic information. Duplex assessment of 18 normal subjects and 10 patients with splenomegaly due to five different causes was undertaken. Analysis of waveform, peak frequency and pulsatility index were compared and failed to demonstrate any significant change. In the normal subject there is a broad systolic spectrum related to the tortuosity of the splenic artery, with persistence of forward flow throughout diastole, a reflection of the low peripheral resistance of the spleen. In splenomegaly the broad systolic spectrum is unchanged, since vessel tortuosity persists. Pathological and physiological assessment of the spleen in splenomegaly shows that a low resistance circulation persists, explaining maintenance of the diastolic flow pattern in splenomegaly. Increased blood flow to the spleen in splenomegaly occurs either as a result of an increase in vessel diameter or an increase in flow velocity, or a variable combination of the two which does not seem to be governed by specific pathology. An increase in peak frequency in some cases reflected some increase in flow velocity but provided no useful correlation. Analysis of the pulsatility index supported the above findings without adding further information.\r"

Clinically it presents as an enlarging mass within muscle, usually of an extremity, and is often mistaken for a soft tissue neoplasm. The diagnosis is made by biopsy which reveals characteristic histological changes of inflammation, focal degeneration and regeneration, and some evidence of denervation. The CT findings include irregularity and enlargement of the muscles involved, with diffuse, poorly defined fatty infiltration of the muscle planes, but no evidence of an associated mass. We present two cases of focal myositis of the calf, both of which mimicked a soft tissue neoplasm, and in which CT was helpful in determining the nature and extent of the abnormality, for needle biopsy, and follow-up.\r"

We have used an automated computerized technique to isolate tumour and measure PHR from computed tomography images of 22 patients. Tumour identification was achieved by establishing local histogram-based thresholds at liver-tumour boundaries displaying clear bimodal histogram distributions. There was a significant association between measured PHR and independent visual estimates of PHR stage defined in quartiles (p less than 0.001). When the measured value of PHR differed from the PHR stage, the visual estimate was always higher. The accuracy of PHR measurement was assessed on stimulated liver computed tomography images. It seems likely that visual estimates of PHR from computed tomography images tend to overestimate tumour extent. The automated technique is probably more accurate and will be useful for assessing and monitoring patients.\r"

Eight healthy young women were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine T1 and T2 times of the normal cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated, in 22 patients, during radiation therapy and at follow-up. During treatment and follow-up, patients with complete tumour response showed a significant T1 reduction compared with the pre-treatment values. With persistence of palpable or visible tumour, T1 times showed a small decrease during therapy, and a marked increase at subsequent examinations. The results suggest that the modifications of T1 times, during radiation therapy and follow-up, could be considered as a useful discriminant between patients with differing tumour response.\r"

The procedure was successful in 95.5%. 12.5% of the fetuses had an abnormal karyotype. Fetal bradycardia was observed in two fetuses (1.8%) and intraperitoneal bleeding in three (2.7%). There were three procedure-related losses but these were not due to the intrahepatic vein sampling itself. Fetal blood sampling is the method of choice for rapid karyotyping in the second and third trimesters, and the intrahepatic vein is an alternate site when access is difficult or failure to sample occurs at the placental cord insertion. Additional advantages of fetal blood sampling at the intrahepatic vein include absence of cord complications, reduced risk of fetal blood loss and fetomaternal haemorrhage, and the lack of need to confirm the fetal origin of the sample.\r"

Increasing degree of the investigation was associated both with increasing frequency of breast self examination (10% were practising breast self-examination at least once a week before screening compared with 24% for women after special assessment and 35% of women who had had an open biopsy (p less than 0.001)), and with greater confidence that any malignancy in the breast would have been found. Psychometric scores showed no increase of general levels of anxiety or depression in the screened groups. For anxiety, percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 2 and 6 for the four groups, respectively, and for depression the percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 4 and 6, respectively; 10% of screened women were more anxious about having breast cancer as a result of the screening. At least 10% of women proceeding to open biopsy of benign lesions require professional counselling and support. Psychological ill effects were not detected by the psychometric test among women who did not proceed to this final investigation. Behavioural changes did suggest a raised awareness or fear of potential cancer among the screened population.\r"

All registrations for 1985 aged over 50 years were staged from case notes and, to assess whether a stage drift is already occurring, cases that presented in 1975 were also staged. The accuracy and completeness of the Wessex Cancer Register for this particular cancer was assessed and further sources of registration identified. There was a significant difference between 1975 and 1985 stage distributions. If the Southampton and Salisbury service achieves the same success as the Gavleborg County trials, 4.61 deaths will be prevented at 5 years for each annual cohort of cases. For individual breast screening programmes, effectiveness is better monitored by analysis of stage distribution than of mortality rates.\r"

Fractional doses of 2 Gy to a total of 50 Gy were administered with the tangential technique. An additional 10 Gy (2 Gy x 5) was given as direct booster. Dynamic and static lung volumes, distribution of ventilation and gas transfer were measured before irradiation and at varying intervals up to 1 year after the completion of therapy. There was a small, but statistically significant decrease in the forced vital capacity (mean 63 ml) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean 79 ml) measured 3 months after irradiation (p less than 0.05). These changes were reversed within 1 year. The reduction in total lung capacity (mean 240 ml) after 3 months was nearly significant (p = 0.06). The remaining variables did not change to a significant degree. We conclude that a slight restrictive ventilatory impairment may occur when a combined tangential and direct booster technique is applied. The changes are, however, small and reversible, and imply no clinical importance.\r"

The subject was a head phantom (a human skull embedded in tissue-equivalent material), which was exposed to X rays over a range of tube voltages (50-90 kVp) for each of the four filter systems. These were 2.7 mm aluminium alone (the existing total filtration) or with added 0.1 mm erbium, 0.1 mm yttrium or 0.05 mm niobium. The radiation dose was measured at four selected sites along the primary beam. These were the entrance skin dose, the exit skin dose and intra-orally both in front and behind the dental film packet. The exposure times and radiation doses required to produce an equivalent density (degree of blackening) on a radiograph of an upper molar tooth were determined. Within the usual diagnostic range of 60-80 kV the use of the thin K-edge filter resulted in a doubling of the exposure time (owing to the additional attenuation of the added filters). However, the skin dose and the total dose imparted to the patient were significantly reduced.\r"

The radiation doses measured in a phantom for such examinations have been compared with the predictions of the \"numerical\" method. Dosimetric measurements with thermoluminescent dosemeters attached to the patient's skin along with measurements of the dose-area product during the examination have enabled us to derive organ doses and to estimate the effective dose-equivalent. Mean frequency weighted values of dose-area product, energy imparted to the patient, doses to a set of organs and effective dose-equivalent in the area of Madrid are reported. Comparisons of the results with those from similar surveys in other countries have been made.\r"

Histology confirmed the presence of fibrosis and a variable chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify the inflammatory cells. B and T lymphocytes were present with the majority of T lymphocytes of the T helper phenotype. The majority of lymphocytes and macrophages and most vascular endothelial cells were HLA-DR positive. Ki67 and BerH2 staining was found in B cells and T helper cells, indicating that these cells were proliferating and activated. These findings compare with the characterisation of inflammatory cells associated with \"inflammatory aneurysms\" and with the inflammatory cells present in the spectrum of inflammation seen as a complication of advanced atherosclerosis--conditions known as \"chronic peri-aortitis\". It is suggested that our findings support the view that idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis represents clinical chronic peri-aortitis seen in an undilated aorta.\r"

Symptoms of stress incontinence in the absence of symptoms of urge incontinence had a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 84% and predictive value of 87%. Symptoms of urge incontinence in the absence of symptoms of stress incontinence excluded genuine stress incontinence. Information on age, parity, enuresis, nocturia, frequency, urgency, cystocele, prolapse and hysterectomy did not contribute to a correct diagnosis. It was concluded that urodynamics are unnecessary in most women presenting with urinary incontinence in general practice.\r"

Measurements were carried out at the bladder neck, midurethrally and distally in the urethra in 30 healthy women during coughing and squeezing. Statistically significant variations were found in pressure and power generation between the 3 sites of measurement both during coughing and squeezing. Power generation and the pressure increase were significantly greater during coughing than during squeezing along the entire length of the urethra. The presence of a dynamic active closure mechanism was demonstrated at the bladder neck in addition to that located midurethrally. This bladder neck mechanism is thought to be due to the vagino-levator sling system (the urethral supports).\r"

Measurements were performed at the bladder neck, midurethrally and distally in the urethra. A statistically significant decrease in power generation was found at the bladder neck and midurethrally during squeezing compared with the values in healthy females. During coughing the power generation was significantly decreased midurethrally and measurement of pressure generation revealed similar results. These findings indicate that the active closure mechanisms at the bladder neck and midurethra are significantly weakened in females with GSI. The results do not support the concept that impaired passive pressure transmission to the urethra is an important pathophysiological factor in GSI.\r"

Upper tract studies revealed dilation of 4 of 22 renal units and 1 patient required endourological intervention. Serum electrolyte studies revealed slightly elevated chloride levels in 6, mild hypocarbia in 3, and reduced vitamin B12 levels in all patients, but no megaloblastic anaemia.

Between January 1979 and January 1988, 36 patients aged from 76 to 84 years (median 78) consented to cisplatin combination chemotherapy. Eighteen patients received 1 to 7 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (median 5). This resulted in a drop in creatinine clearance rate from 70 +/- 28.5 ml/min to 49 +/- 20 ml/min. Eight patients (44%) are alive without evidence of disease, with a whole group median survival of 23 months. The dose intensity of cisplatin was found to predict recurrence. Eighteen other patients were treated for metastatic disease; 39% had an objective response after receiving 2 to 9 cycles (median 7). Only 2 patients (11%) are alive and free of disease. In this group no significant kidney damage occurred and the dose intensity of cisplatin did not predict response. Treatment resulted in a significant sepsis rate (39%) and 6 patients (17%) withdrew from treatment because of toxicity. It was concluded that cisplatin combination chemotherapy can be administered without treatment-related death and its efficacy is similar to that in younger patients. Age should not exclude patients from the potential benefit of such therapy. An important cause of reduced benefit from chemotherapy among elderly patients may be the reduced dosage of cisplatin.\r"

Both trials failed to recruit their target numbers of 250 patients in the West Midlands and 320 in Australia. Since they had similar treatment protocols and eligibility criteria, they were combined in an overview analysis, achieving a total number of 255 patients. Each treatment group was compared with its own control group and the differences were pooled to give an overall result. There was no difference in survival between treated and control patients. The odds ratio was 1.13 with the control groups faring marginally better than the chemotherapy groups. Even with 255 patients the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio was wide (0.80-1.57). Although there is no clear evidence of a clinically worthwhile benefit from neo-adjuvant cisplatin, this approach must be tested in a larger study using combination treatments with greater activity in metastatic disease.\r"

TRUS was more sensitive in the detection of tumour and in the detection of direct extracapsular spread. MRI was more sensitive in the detection of tumour involvement of the seminal vesicles and bladder base. MRI allowed the detection of lymphadenopathy and bone metastases in the lumbosacral spine and pelvis. During MRI the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence was found to be particularly useful for the detection of tumour spread. TRUS and MRI are complementary investigations and for the accurate staging of prostatic malignancy both investigations should be used.\r"

However, 49 men with normal bone scans were found to have similarly raised serum PAP. (Such patients are defined as having skeletal metastases in the current Medical Research Council immediate versus deferred orchiectomy study and stratified accordingly). The actuarial survival of this group was calculated by life table methods and was compared with that of 2 other subgroups: those patients having metastases demonstrated on bone scan, and those patients having both normal bone scans and normal serum PAP. The survival of the \"metastatic by acid phosphatase\" group was significantly better than that of the \"metastatic by bone scan\" group but did not differ from that of patients having both normal scans and PAP. For patients with no scintigraphic evidence of skeletal metastases at diagnosis, those with a raised PAP were at a significantly greater risk of scan conversion, although this was more powerfully predicted by high histological grade.\r"

Serial measurements were made in all patients operated on in the past 3 years; 131 had undetectable levels and 59 had levels in the detectable range. Only 10% of the patients with undetectable PSA following surgery had seminal vesical involvement or positive lymph nodes. None of the patients with undetectable PSA have had clinical recurrence within the 41 months of mean follow-up. In 14 patients who had PSA serially measured since surgery, detectable levels were found within 6 months of operation and 7 of these patients had clinical progression within 2 years; 39 patients had detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy with no clinical evidence of recurrence. Biopsy of the anastomosis was performed in 11 patients with isolated detectable PSA after surgery and local recurrence was established in 4. PSA was detectable later in the follow-up of 45 patients operated on before the PSA assay became available but the date when PSA actually became detectable is not known. A relatively new method of estimating that date and constructing a corresponding Kaplan Meier curve is presented. PSA is an effective marker for monitoring patients after radical prostatectomy as it often detects early persistent disease in patients with detectable measurements 6 months post-operatively or recurrent disease in patients with later rising levels.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about changes in bladder compliance and bladder capacity in myelodysplastic patients following anti-reflux surgery. A study group of 70 patients was divided as follows: group A included 20 myelodysplastic patients who had been operated on for reflux and whose subsequent treatment was conservative. Group B comprised 31 myelodysplastic patients who had been treated conservatively; a third group of 19 non-myelodysplastic patients, treated by anti-reflux surgery because of primary reflux, formed the control group. The follow-up period for group A averaged 61 months (extending from a urodynamic study 3 months after surgery to the most recent test). In group B the mean follow-up period between the initial test and the latest test was 86 months. Bladder compliance in group A patients did not increase significantly (from 5.5 to 6.9), but patients in group B did show a significant increase (from 5.9 to 10.7). Compliance in the 19 non-myelodysplastic patients decreased only marginally 6 months after surgery (from 29.6 to 26.3). Changes in bladder capacity showed a similar trend. In their most recent test, however, the bladder capacity of group A patients increased to the same volume as that of group B. A high correlation between radiological bladder deformity and bladder compliance was found. We propose a bladder compliance of 10.0 as the lower limit for myelodysplastic patients' preferred range. It was concluded that anti-reflux operations prevent any improvement in bladder compliance (but not in bladder capacity) compared with conservative treatment.\r"

Evidence indicates that tissue damage is largely caused by activated neutrophils which accumulate when the tissue is reperfused. If the area of ischaemic tissue is large, neutrophils also sequester in the lungs, inducing non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Ischaemia reperfusion injury is initiated by production of reactive oxygen species which initially appear responsible for the generation of chemotactic activity for neutrophils. Later, once adherent to endothelium, neutrophils mediate damage by secretion of additional reactive oxygen species as well as proteolytic enzymes, in particular elastase. Therapeutic options for limiting ischaemia reperfusion injury include inhibition of oxygen radical formation, pharmacological prevention of neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, and also the use of monoclonal antibodies which prevent neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, a prerequisite for injury.\r"

Twenty patients (14 males, six females) underwent the Duhamel operation over a 17-year period for this condition. The mean age at operation was 25 years; the mean age of onset of constipation was 3 years; and the mean follow-up period was 4.5 years. All the resected colons were of enlarged diameter. There was agreement between the preoperative radiographs and the operative specimens with regard to which parts of the rectum and colon were dilated. Subjective feelings of well-being were generally improved by surgery, as was bowel frequency in ten patients. Soiling, straining, abdominal pain and distension were, however, common after operation. Early complications were also common and five patients required further surgery for constipation. The Duhamel operation for megarectum and megacolon is characterized by an improved sense of well-being and improved bowel frequency, but it is associated with the persistence of many symptoms and further surgery is often required.\r"

This technique was evaluated in 16 patients with colorectal tumours (14 cancers, one adenoma, one lipoma) with the 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody (MAb) ICR2 which recognizes the tumour-associated epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). At operation counting was carried out (3 x 20 s per site) using a hand-held radiation probe over the primary lesions and any palpable lymph nodes in the mesocolon. The tumour to normal colon (T/NC) ratio of counts recorded at operation was more than 1.5:1 in eight of the 14 patients with cancer (mean(s.d.), 1.54(0.41):1) and 0.91:1 and 1.06:1 respectively in the two patients with benign tumours. Node to normal colon ratios were higher in lymph nodes containing metastases. The uptake of radiolabelled antibody (T/NC ratio) was higher in EMA-expressing cancers than in those not expressing the target antigen (mean(s.d.), 2.45(0.65):1 versus 1.40(0.20):1, P = 0.019). An abdominal tumour model was also developed. Radioactively filled containers of 0.5-10 ml representing tumour deposits were suspended in a tank of 111In solution representing the background activity found in normal tissues. The ratio of radioactivity in the 'tumour' to that of background varied from 2:1 to 8:1. The 'tumour' was considered to be detectable if the mean counts recorded over the 'tumour' exceeded the mean of counts recorded over background by three standard deviations. At a ratio of 2:1 only 'tumours' greater than 5 ml could be detected with a sodium iodide probe and those over 10 ml could be detected with a cadmium telluride (CdTe) probe. At a ratio of 8:1, 'tumours' of 0.5 ml could be detected with either probe. At all ratios and counting periods the NaI probe was more sensitive than the CdTe.\r"

Our aim was to determine whether suture technique affected the incidence of perianastomotic tumours in experimentally induced colonic cancer. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups. A 1 cm longitudinal colotomy was repaired with four interrupted 6/0 polypropylene monofilament sutures, using either a transmural technique (n = 18) or a seromuscular technique (n = 18). Control animals (n = 18) had a sham laparotomy. All animals received nine, weekly, subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg/kg) starting 6 weeks after laparotomy. Surviving animals were killed 32 weeks after laparotomy. Five animals from each group were given intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg) 1 h before being killed. At death, perianastomotic tumours occurred more frequently in animals with transmural sutures than in either controls or those with seromuscular sutures. This difference was associated with a greater mucosal bromodeoxyuridine crypt cell labelling index in the transmural suture group. We conclude that a transmural anastomotic suture technique promotes the development of experimental perianastomotic colonic tumours.\r"

Lesions were multiple in 71 per cent and over half were situated below the knees. Ulcerative colitis was active in 11 patients (50 per cent) and Crohn's disease was active in nine (75 per cent) when pyoderma gangrenosum was diagnosed. Associated illnesses--most commonly a seronegative arthritis affecting large joints--were present in 55 per cent and 92 per cent of cases respectively. A diffuse pustular rash appeared in six patients, synchronously with pyoderma in five. In a further seven patients (two with ulcerative colitis, five with Crohn's disease) the onset or course of pyoderma might have been linked to the presence of non-dermatological suppuration. Pyoderma resolved without intestinal resection in two-thirds of patients. When present at the time of surgical resection (15 procedures in 13 patients), pyoderma healed promptly in six cases, only with additional therapy in four cases and very slowly or not at all in five cases. Pyoderma gangrenosum occurs in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Healing after intestinal resection is unpredictable both with respect to timing and extent of resection.\r"

The policy in outline consists of conservative treatment for acute obstructive episodes, resection or strictureplasty for recurrent obstructive episodes, surgical treatment for abscess and fistula formation and specific medical treatment (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy or metronidazole) for symptomatic non-obstructive disease. Twenty-nine patients had a benign course without resection. The remainder were treated surgically at some time but only 28 of these patients had specific treatment before operation. Thirty-three needed more than one resection and five needed more than three surgical procedures. Immediate, early or delayed surgical treatment did not affect the reoperation rates or the long-term outcome. Eleven patients died, ten of causes unrelated to Crohn's disease. Of the 128 living patients, 114 are fit and well, and only two are currently taking specific medication. Fourteen are unwell of whom six either need or have refused further surgery which could restore them to good health. This management policy has achieved excellent long-term results in nearly all patients, and our findings suggest that the timing of surgery and its nature are more important in determining outcome than specific medical therapy.\r"

Videoproctography with synchronous sphincteric electromyography and anorectal manometry was performed. There were no differences between the two groups, suggesting that slow transit constipation is not secondary to any abnormality in anorectal function and may therefore be a primary disorder of colonic motility. There was no correlation between electromyographic evidence of anismus (pelvic floor contraction on defaecation) and the ability of the patient to evacute the rectum or symptoms of obstructed defaecation. Electromyography findings alone can be misleading and should be related to proctographic evidence of incomplete rectal evacuation before functional anismus can be said to be present.\r"

  ".W": "The problem of the biochemical quantification of long term human wound healing was approached by measuring collagen synthesis in reincisions using specific radioimmunoassays for the wound fluid concentrations of the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP). First-day wound fluid PICP concentration after reincising a 3 week old scar was 25 times higher than the mean value in 20 reference standard incisions but scars older than 3 months did not show this difference. Wound fluid taken in subsequent days demonstrated that the initial acceleration of synthesis disappeared by the fourth day. When wound fluid PIIINP was assessed, high concentrations were found in reincisions of wounds for up to 5 months after the previous operation. The acceleration was also lost more slowly during the first postoperative week. The duration of a high rate of type I collagen synthesis compares well with studies in experimental wounds which show increased gain of strength if they are made not more than 6 weeks after previous surgery. The longer activity of the metabolism of type III collagen related antigens could reflect their function in the regulation of collagen fibril formation.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous blood transfusion in surgery for cancer has been avoided because of the metastatic potential of reinfused malignant cells. This study determined whether viable tumour cells remain in the red cell concentrate after separation and whether blood transfusion filters remove these tumour cells before reinfusion. Units of banked blood were inoculated with tumour cell lines: breast cancer SKBr3; colon cancer COLO 320; lymphoma Daudi; erythroleukaemia K562. After processing with the Cell Saver, aliquots of the red cell concentrate and waste saline wash were examined for tumour cells and cultured. Tumour cells from all four cell lines were identified in the red cell concentrate but not in the waste saline wash. All the cell lines except Daudi grew from the red cell concentrate. Experiments on two of the cell lines (SKBr3 and COLO 320) were performed in which the red cell concentrate was either unfiltered (control) or filtered with SQ40S blood transfusion filter or RC100 leucocyte depletion filter. Both cell lines were present in the control samples and after filtration with SQ40S filters, and cells from these samples grew normally in culture. No tumour cells were evident after filtration with the RC100 filters and no growth of either cell line was found after 1 week in culture. The Cell Saver in combination with RC100 filters may be suitable for use during the surgical treatment of malignant disease.\r"

Thirty-three patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection (septicaemia, meningitis or pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization) and three developed overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. The incidence and mortality rates of severe late postsplenectomy infection were 0.42 and 0.08 per 100 person years exposure respectively and for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection the incidence and mortality rates were 0.04 per 100 person years exposure. There were 628 splenectomies after trauma, giving 3922 person years exposure. Eight patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection of whom one had overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. Following trauma, the incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection was 0.21 per 100 person years exposure, with the incidence and mortality rates of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection being 0.03 per 100 person years exposure. Patients undergoing splenectomy have a 12.6-fold increased risk of developing late septicaemia compared with the general population. Splenectomy following trauma gives an 8.6-fold increased risk of late septicaemia. The majority of severe late postsplenectomy infections did not occur within the first 2 years and 42 per cent of severe late postsplenectomy infections occurred greater than 5 years after splenectomy. The low incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection and overwhelming postsplenectomy infection makes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics, vaccination and splenic repair most difficult.\r"

Treatment was by simple mastectomy (37 cases), cone excision of the nipple-areola complex (ten cases) and tamoxifen (one case). DCIS was found in 45 operative specimens (96 per cent); eight had associated invasion. The DCIS was predominantly large cell solid/comedo in type and was multifocal in seven cases (19 per cent). At a median (range) follow-up of 56 (18-96) months, four of the ten patients treated by cone excision have developed a local recurrence, two of these patients have also developed metastases. Two of the 37 patients who underwent mastectomy developed loco-regional recurrences; both had invasive foci at their first operation and remain disease free at 8 years. We no longer feel that cone excision is appropriate treatment.\r"

Recent work has suggested that venous distension plays a role in initiating the process. Our previous work has shown that the deep veins of the lower limb distend in patients undergoing surgical procedures. We have investigated 40 patients receiving surgical treatment on the abdomen or neck. A medial gastrocnemius vein was studied using ultrasound imaging during the operations. In half the patients a graduated compression anti-embolism stocking was applied to the limb under study at the start of the operation, immediately after initial measurements of vein diameter. The median vein diameter in both groups was the same at the start of the operative procedures (control, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.3 mm; stocking, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.7 mm). After application of a stocking the median diameter in this group fell to 1.6 mm (interquartile range 1.3-2.8 mm) and then decreased slightly at the end of the operation. In the control group the vein diameter increased to 2.9 mm (interquartile range 2.3-4.0 mm) during the operative procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1986 and 1988, 38 patients (29 men and nine women), median age 65 years (range 38-85 years), underwent local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy for acute lower limb ischaemia. Three patient groups were identified: 15 with acute on chronic ischaemia (group 1), 12 postangioplasty (group 2) and 11 postfemorodistal bypass (group 3). Distal arteriographic run-off was a significant discriminant between success and failure in group 1 (n = 15, chi 2 = 11.5, P = 0.001) and in the overall group (n = 38, chi 2 = 17.2, P less than 0.001). In group 2, four patients with good run-off had an unsuccessful outcome; this was due in all cases to technical problems (haemorrhage in two and intimal dissection in two). In group 3, two patients with good run-off had unsuccessful streptokinase infusions. In both cases the graft failed in the early postoperative period (less than 30 days). By contrast, the four patients whose grafts occluded after 30 days had successful streptokinase infusions and long-term graft patency was achieved by further surgery and balloon dilatation. In all groups, no patient with a poor run-off had a successful outcome following streptokinase administration. The role of local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy in the critically ischaemic limb remains controversial, but these results suggest that an adequate run-off is an important factor in the selection of patients for treatment.\r"

DESIGN: Recipient-blinded study; first-time vaccinees were randomly assigned to receive either of the vaccines from one manufacturer in the 1989-90 influenza season. Subjects were asked to complete a symptom questionnaire during the 48 hours after immunization. SETTING: Annual influenza program for staff of a tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers were sought among approximately 2200 members of the hospital staff. Of the 358 vaccinated for the first time, 333 (93%) returned the questionnaire. RESULTS: During the 48 hours after vaccination 13% of the SVV recipients reported generalized aching, as compared with 26% of the WVV recipients (p less than 0.01). Also, the SVV group reported fewer visible local reactions and more transient arm soreness, but the actual differences between the two groups were small. The occurrence of mild symptoms was equally common in the two groups (local reactions in at least 70% of cases, systemic reactions in at least 33%). In each group 1% of the subjects reported missing work because of the vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SVV reduces the rate of the most objectionable of the common adverse effects of influenza vaccination. Therefore, as with children, it might be more acceptable to health care workers than the current use of WVV.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the use of acute care hospital services for diseases of the circulatory system in Ontario. DESIGN: Observational study. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on diagnoses, procedures and demographic characteristics was obtained from routinely collected computerized abstracts of separations from all acute care hospitals in Ontario during 1979-80, 1983-84 and 1988-89. The data were combined with population estimates to calculate overall separation rates and rates specific for age, diagnosis and procedure. Resource intensity weights were used to estimate changes in resource use. MAIN RESULTS: The overall separation rate increased by 3% and the resource-intensity-weighted separation rate by 12% from 1979-80 to 1988-89. The overall medical separation rate increased by 2%, whereas the surgical rate increased by 12%. The surgical separation rate increased among patients 55 to 79 years of age but decreased in all the other adult age groups. The separation rates for coronary artery bypass surgery and cardiac valve surgery increased rapidly among patients 65 years of age or older. The medical separation rate decreased for patients of all ages except those less than 5 years and those 80 years or more. The medical separation rates decreased by less than 1% for diagnoses related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and increased dramatically for coronary artery revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing elderly population has not resulted in large increases in acute care hospital utilization for diseases of the circulatory system. The impact of an aging population has been balanced by decreased utilization rates in the younger groups. The intensity of hospital care has risen primarily because of increases in surgical rates, especially in the elderly population. The large decrease in the rate of death from IHD over the past two decades has not been associated with similar decreases in acute care hospital utilization for this disorder.\r"

Both drugs were given by continuous intravenous infusion. Among 27 patients with well-differentiated carcinoid tumors or islet cell carcinomas, only two partial objective tumor regressions were observed (7%). Among 18 patients prospectively classified as having anaplastic neuroendocrine carcinomas, however, there were nine partial regressions and three complete regressions, an overall regression rate of 67%. For anaplastic disease, the median duration of regression was 8 months (range to 21 months). Tumor response was unrelated to primary site, endocrine hyperfunction, or prior therapy experience. The median survival of all patients with anaplastic tumors was 19 months; this seemed favorable when considering the small experiences with these rare tumors reported in the literature. Toxicity, which was severe for most patients, consisted primarily of vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy. The anaplastic neuroendocrine tumor is strongly responsive to therapy with combined etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with undifferentiated carcinomas, originating in typical neuroendocrine tumor sites (small and large bowel, pancreas, and stomach) or of unknown origin, who have consistent histologic findings by light microscopy should be evaluated for this possibility with appropriate immune staining or electron microscopy.\r"

  ".W": "A novel chemotherapeutic approach was designed for the treatment of intermediate and high-grade histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using augmented (but subtransplantation) doses of chemotherapy administered at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. For the initial evaluation of this regimen, poor prognosis patients were treated with a projected long-term survival rate of less than 25% in response to standard therapy. Between March 1982 and May 1988, 56 previously untreated patients were entered into this study; all patients had either high-grade histology (20 patients) or predominantly large cell lymphoma (36 patients). Median age was 41.5 years (range, 18 to 69 years). Poor prognosis features included: Stage IV, 71%; poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, 2 to 4), 55%; multiple extranodal sites of disease, 52%; elevated lactic dehydrogenase (greater than 300 IU/l), 43%; and bulky (greater than 10 cm) tumor masses, 30%. Thirty-three of 56 patients (59%) were in Shipp's Category 3. During the 6-year study, the chemotherapy regimen was modified in an attempt to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. However, most patients received a 2-month course of therapy as follows: cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, and 29; etoposide 400 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 and 100 mg/m2 on days 29, 30, 31; doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV on days 29, 30; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; bleomycin 10 units/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; methotrexate 200 mg/m2 IV on days 15 and 43 followed 24 hours later by leucovorin 15 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours for six doses; and prednisone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 7 and 29 to 35. The complete response (CR) rate was 77% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 86%). There were ten relapses, only one of which occurred after 18 months of follow-up. Overall event-free survival (EFS) was 52% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 68%), with a median follow-up of 36 months. Eleven of 13 patients with small noncleaved lymphoma had CR; actuarial EFS in this subgroup was 61%. Myelosuppression occurred in all patients, with severe leukopenia (less than 1000/microliters) lasting a median of 12 days (range, 3 to 29 days); toxic deaths occurred in five patients (9%; 95% confidence interval, 4% to 19%). This intensive approach improved the response and survival of very poor risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.\r"

Of 44 patients evaluable for response, 28 (64%) had an objective response, including seven (16%) who had a complete response. The median duration of response was 4 months (range, 0 to 38 months), and the median survival from the time of entry was 14 months (range, less than 1 to greater than 45 months). Myelosuppression was the most common dose-limiting toxicity, with 54% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (including 28% with granulocytopenic fever and one septic death), and cumulative Grade 3 anemia occurred in 28% of patients. Grades 3 to 4 stomatitis was observed in 18% of patients. An active, although highly toxic regimen when used as first-line therapy in MBC, M-VAC has a response rate and survival duration similar to existing, less toxic combination regimens. As such, M-VAC cannot be recommended in preference to other combination chemotherapy regimens in this clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, multiple primary lung cancers have been reported with greater frequency, partly as a result of technologic advances in the detection of lung cancer and therapeutic achievements in its management. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new therapy used with increasing frequency in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies, including central lung cancers. In PDT, the differential retention of an injected photosensitizer by malignant tissue is exploited by treatment with a low-power laser beam delivered endoscopically. Since 1980, 145 patients with central lung cancers, including 35 cases of endoscopically evaluated early-stage lesions were treated with PDT at Tokyo Medical College. Thirteen of these 145 patients had multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas, five cases of which were synchronous with the rest, metachronous. Three of 13 patients with multiple tumors had early-stage lesions and were treated with endoscopic PDT alone. In the other ten cases, PDT was used to treat accessible early-stage foci although operative excision was required for advanced lesions. Mean survival after PDT, alone or in combination with surgery, was 38 months (range, 14 to 87 months), and seven patients remain alive to date. It was concluded that PDT is useful in extending the therapeutic options for, and improving the prognosis of patients with, multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas.\r"

After intrapericardial insertion of a catheter, a maximal volume of pericardial fluid was withdrawn with cytologic confirmation of malignancy. Five or 10 Klinische Einheit (KE) (KE is a unit used to express the strength of a preparation) of OK-432 diluted in 20 ml of saline was injected into the pericardial space in seven and three patients, respectively. It was repeated in case of reaccumulation. Seven patients were treated only once and the remaining three required a second treatment. Complete control of pericardial effusion was achieved in all patients for an average of 329 days (range, 54 to 790 days). Fever and chest pain were experienced in six and five patients, respectively, but were controlled with antipyretics. Two of three patients who received 10 KE of OK-432 experienced hypotension that was successfully controlled with vasopressor drugs with or without reaspiration of pericardial fluid. Rapid reactive reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid was thought to be a cause of hypotension. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in seven patients and a thickened pericardium was noticed in five; no patients had constrictive pericarditis. These results suggest that intrapericardial administration of 5 KE of OK-432 is an effective and safe treatment for malignant pericardial effusion.\r"

The overall cumulative 5-year survival rate was 89% and the mean age was 44.6 years. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 92%; 14 patients were explored for radical hysterectomy that was not performed due to high risk features and their survival rate was 50%. Ninety-seven patients underwent radiation therapy as initial treatment and had a 5-year survival rate of 86%. There was no significant difference when radiation therapy was compared with radical hysterectomy (P = 0.098). The survival rates for lesions 3 cm or smaller were 94% for radical hysterectomy and 88% for radiation therapy. When the lesion was larger than 3 cm, the survival rates were 82% with radical surgery and 73% with radiation therapy. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was present in 26 of the 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy. When 1 to 3 nodes were involved 16 of 19 patients survived and when 4 to 10 nodes were involved 3 of 7 patients survived. The addition of radiation therapy did not influence survival. Complications were similar in both treatment groups. Fistulas occurred in 4 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 1 of 111 undergoing radiation. Second surgery for a complication was required in 6 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 7 of 111 undergoing radiation. Survival and complication rates in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are equal with either radical surgery or radiation therapy.\r"

A total of 40 courses were given. Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity, with a maximum tolerated dose of 50 mg/m2/d of oral etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of IV cisplatin on day 1. Doses of 40 mg/m2/d of etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin for 1 day in four of eight courses (50%) were associated with Grade 3 or worse leukopenia that occurred between days 18 and 26. However, no Grade 3 or worse thrombocytopenia occurred at this dose level. Nausea and vomiting occurred in most patients at each dose level but were mild and could be controlled by antiemetics. Alopecia also occurred frequently. Significant mucositis (Grade 4) occurred in one patient, but no other toxicities were observed. Four partial responses that lasted from 1.3 to 5.8+ months were observed in patients with cervical (one patient), small cell lung (one patient), and squamous cell lung cancer (two patients); one of them had been heavily pretreated with platin analogue-containing regimens. The recommended doses for Phase II studies on this schedule are 40 mg/m2/d of oral etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of IV cisplatin on day 1. A combination regimen on this schedule seems particularly effective in patients with etoposide-sensitive malignancies.\r"

One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival.\r"

By contrast, the interval (less than or equal to versus greater than 12 months) between the two operations significantly affected survival (P = 0.0096) and DFI (P = 0.046). The DFI was also affected by the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for the primary tumor (P = 0.02). Using the Cox model, AC was the most independent predictor of DFI. These data support the inclusion of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with NSCLC and SBM.\r"

The overall ER-positive rate in the cytosol and nuclear fraction was 19.2%. The maximum binding site (Bmax) was 36.0 to 175.0 fmol/mg of protein, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.6 to 1.6 X 10(-9) in cytosol fraction. In the nuclear fraction, Bmax was 7.5 fmol/mg of DNA and Kd was 2.3 X 10(-9). Estrogen receptors were characterized in cytosol protein. In cytosol, the estrogen (E2)-ER complex was sedimented at approximately the 5S and 8S regions by 5% to 20% linear sucrose gradient centrifugation. A steroid specificity study of ER showed the presence of an binder in gastric cancer tissue. In conclusion, these results that gastric cancer tissue has E2 binding sites with the same biochemical characteristics as in breast cancer and endometrial cancer strongly suggest the hormonal dependency of gastric cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The need for second-look surgery after chemotherapy in children with advanced germ cell tumors is controversial, particularly when levels of the tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta HCG) are elevated at diagnosis. The authors evaluated the outcome of second-look surgery in relationship to tumor marker status in 27 patients with Stage III to IV disease who had completed four courses of chemotherapy. Markers were elevated at diagnosis in 19 patients. After chemotherapy, markers normalized in 12 of these patients. Second-look surgery confirmed complete response (CR) in these 12 patients, two of whom had residual masses on computed tomography (CT) scan (mature teratoma and necrotic tumor). The AFP decreased but did not normalize in seven patients; five had residual disease at second look and the other two later developed measurable disease. Of the eight patients with normal AFP at diagnosis, second look confirmed clinical CR in four. The other four patients had CT evidence of residual masses: surgery showed necrotic tissue in two cases, mature glial elements in one, and mature teratoma with glial elements in one. Thus second-look surgery added no information for treatment planning in children with elevated tumor markers at diagnosis and might best be reserved for patients without tumor markers at diagnosis and residual masses on CT scan, and those with persistent elevation of tumor markers and potentially resectable residual disease. Because of the possibility of small amount of residual tumor, second-look surgery may also be useful in patients whose markers normalize but who have residual masses on CT scans.\r"

Amplification of the c-erbB-2 protooncogene has been correlated with poor prognosis in invasive mammary carcinoma, and immunohistochemical evaluation for expression of the oncogene protein has been correlated with gene amplification. The authors retrospectively evaluated 62 cases of lobular neoplasia for expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product on formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections, using two monoclonal anti-erbB-2 (p185) antibodies (c-neu Ab3 and m-erb) and one polyclonal anti-erbB-2 antibody (pAb 1) by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. All 62 cases were negative with the pAb 1 antibody; one of 62 cases was weakly positive with the c-neu Ab3 in a membranous pattern. Expression of c-erbB-2 gene product was identified on adjacent invasive ductal carcinoma in one case and in adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ in another. None of 15 cases if infiltrating lobular carcinoma was positive with either of the two anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies. Strong positivity was found on benign epithelium in one case, demonstrating epitheliosis. In summary, evidence of expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product was found in one of 57 cases of LCIS and none of 15 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. This suggests that, in contrast to reported data concerning intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma, c-erbB-2 oncogene amplification and/or overexpression does not play a significant role in the progression of lobular breast neoplasia.\r"

Seven were classified into the massively penetrating (down growth) type, four into the superficially spreading (spreading growth) type, and five into the unclassified type. In the down growth type, the ratio of the submucosal area to the total (mucosa and submucosa) area was more than 0.2 (one fifth), and in the others that ratio was less than 0.2. The down growth type is characterized by a tendency toward elevated lesions, a high incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a poor prognosis after surgery. Lymphatic and/or vascular invasions were recognized in six of seven cases, and the 5-year survival rate was 0%. In contrast, the spreading growth and unclassified types was characterized by superficial lesions, a low incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a favorable prognosis. In only one with the spreading growth type was there lymphatic invasion. Three of the four with the spreading growth type survived over 5 years, and the other one with the spreading growth type and all of five with the unclassified type are alive without recurrences 15 to 52 months after surgery. Thus, growth patterns reflect well the prognosis of the submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

Of these, 99 were diagnosed cytologically as \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" and 9 as \"consistent with liver cell adenoma.\" The cytologic diagnoses were confirmed in the follow-up of all cases. Among the 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 10, 11, and 12 years, respectively. The nine patients with liver cell adenoma were all users of oral contraceptives over a period ranging from 5 to 10 years. Of these, two who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 8 and 10 years, respectively, had foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia within the adenomas. The cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of liver cell dysplasia included cytoplasmic and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism together with prominent nucleoli, hyperchromasia and multinucleation. The cytologic features of liver cell dysplasia strikingly mimic hepatocellular carcinoma. From this study, the foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia arising within the liver cell adenomas appear to be the missing link responsible for the transformation of liver cell adenoma to carcinoma. It is believed that liver cell adenomas are not premalignant and may undergo reversible change after withdrawal of causative agents, whereas liver cell dysplasia is an irreversible, premalignant change and will eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

All 76 borderline tumors expressed the tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) recognized by MoAb B72.3. Striking staining differences (P less than 0.0001) were observed between the hormone-related and the nonhormone-related tumors. Differences were also noticed between the staining of tumors from pregnant patients and that of previous, persistent, or recurrent tumors of the ipsilateral or contralateral ovaries when the same patients were not pregnant. Tumor MoAb B72.3 reactivity increased with progressive gestational age and fell to lower levels at term and during the postpartum period. Although it has been suggested by cell culture studies, enhanced TAG-72 expression in human tumors under hormonal stimulation has not been described before.\r"

In B-CLL, 145 cases were M-rosette+ (86.83%), 135 surface immunoglobulin (SIg)+ (80.84%), and 117 M-rosette+ SIg+ (70.06%). Of 32 SIg- cases, 28 were M-rosette+; and of 22 M-rosette-cases, 18 were SIg+. By combining results of the two assays and accepting positivity of either one or both as sufficient for diagnosis, B-CLL was diagnosed in 163 cases (97.60%). CD5 was performed in 49 cases of the 167 with paired data for SIg and M-rosettes. By combining the results of the three assays and accepting positivity of any two or all three as sufficient for diagnosis, all 49 cases (100%) were diagnosed. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between M-rosette, SIg, and CD5 expression. The results demonstrate the independent expression of the three markers, and their complementary role in immunophenotyping B-CLL. In RLC, all 119 cases were T-lineage and SIg-, and 115 were M-rosette-, indicating the role of the two markers in differentiating B-CLL from RLC. Three of the four M-rosette+ T-RLC were subsequently diagnosed as B-CLL, suggesting the necessity of follow-up of such cases.\r"

Age of patients ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a bimodal distribution, with peaks in the third and seventh decades. Lymphadenopathy was present in nearly all patients. Extranodal involvement, including skin, soft tissue, bone, central nervous system, lung, or small intestine was observed in a total of 54% of the patients, either at presentation or during the course of disease. \"Prototypic\" features of large cell anaplastic lymphomas were observed for eight T-cell lymphomas, with morphologic heterogeneity noted for the remainder. Eight patients, all with T-cell neoplasms (only one with prototypic morphology), have died of lymphoma (median survival, 5 months). An antecedent history of a lymphoproliferative disorder (mycosis fungoides, B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic lymphadenopathy) was apparent in seven patients. An 8-year history of Crohn's disease occurred in one patient with a T-cell lymphoma involving small intestine. Phenotypically, loss of one or more markers was typically noted for T-cell neoplasms. Leukocyte common antigen was detected in all cases, although partial loss of immunoreactivity was noticed in some cases. Nearly all cases evaluated for Ia antigen or alpha-1-antichymotrysin were reactive. Eleven of 16 T-cell, two of six B-cell, and two null cell lymphomas expressed epithelial membrane antigen. Ki-1-positive large cell lymphomas are characterized by clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic heterogeneity.\r"

Forty-one percent (9 of 22) of tumors classified as well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (WDNC) were aneuploid. In contrast, 85% (17 of 20) of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), and 73% (8 of 11) of intermediate cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (ICNC) were aneuploid. DNA content was not a significant independent predictor of patient survival within each histologic subtype (P greater than 0.05 for all subtypes). Yet, when all cases were examined as a single group, diploid cases showed better clinical survival than cases with DNA aneuploidy (P less than 0.02). However, the survival advantage for diploid DNA content did not quite achieve statistical significance when only cases of limited stage disease were analyzed (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05). Histologic subtype was also a prognostic indicator, with WDNC cases showing a significantly longer survival than either SCNC (P less than 0.05) or ICNC (P less than 0.02), for those cases with limited-stage disease. These results indicate information on clinical staging and the histologic subtype are important parameters to compare with DNA content analysis in determining independent prognostic factors in neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the lung.\r"

Five-year survival rates in Groups A, B, and C were 7.9%, 31.6%, and 57.6%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Cox's regression analysis showed that duodenal invasion is an independent prognostic factor in cases of a gastric antrum carcinoma. Gastric cancer with duodenal invasion (Groups A and B) most often was infiltrative and the incidence of serosal invasion, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis was high. Duodenal invasion was direct through submucosal or subserosal layers or through submucosal lymphatics.\r"

The authors reviewed pathologic material from all preoperatively treated unilateral Wilms' tumors registered on the third National Wilms' Tumor Study. Preoperative therapy was associated with increased ambiguity of tumor stage. The prevalence of anaplasia in the 83 evaluable specimens was similar to, although slightly increased over, that in comparable high-stage untreated Wilms' tumors (11% versus 5% to 8%), and it appeared to retain its adverse connotations. These data also suggest that alterations of tumor character and distribution by therapy provide useful prognostic information. All 17 children whose residual viable tumor was limited to intrarenal sites at the time of resection were alive and disease-free at last follow-up. Extensive (greater than 90%) tumor necrosis, low mitotic activity, and high degrees of differentiation of residual tumor were also associated with favorable outcomes. Although careful utilization of preoperative chemotherapy can be of value in children with otherwise difficult-to-manage Wilms' tumors, the potential benefits of preoperative tumor bulk reduction must be weighed against the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment as a result of increased ambiguity of tumor stage.\r"

The rate of decline was similar to the rate of rise in all 17 patients. Five of these patients had distant metastases (P less than 0.02) within 2 years of treatment. The PSA values after radiation therapy were employed to formulate a model of tumor kinetics. This model predicts the mean duration of G0. This parameter is correlated with the development of distant metastases within 2 years of treatment. For those patients at low risk for relapse, the mean G0 is calculated to be 22.5, and 13.6 weeks for those who have relapsed or are at high risk for relapse.\r"

Despite the presence of a minor fibroblastic component, the tumor did not conform to established criteria for a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Formation of frequent desmosome-like intercellular junctions raised the possibility of dendritic reticulum cell differentiation, since the latter cells seem to be the only elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system that display such specialized cell junctions. The results of immunostaining were discrepant with those reported for normal dendritic reticulum cells, but the currently available information makes it doubtful that the entire neoplastic spectrum of dendritic cell differentiation can currently be diagnosed in surgical pathology.\r"

Thirty-four of these patients had cranial nerve involvement at presentation; 30 of them had involvement of one or more of the third to sixth cranial nerves. Most cases of intracranial extension of tumor were accompanied by erosion of the base of the skull, but the reverse was not true. All patients with cranial nerve palsy involving the third to sixth cranial nerves had associated erosion of the ipsilateral base of the skull. The CT evaluation of patients with cranial nerve involvement who are believed to harbor NPC should include thin cuts of the base of the skull for detection of subtle bone erosion. This may be the only clue to the presence of a small NPC. The prognostic significance of cranial nerve involvement, base of the skull erosion, and intracranial extension of the tumor on the survival of the group of 84 patients who had T4 tumors was evaluated with regression analysis using the Cox model. Only cranial nerve involvement was found to be a significant factor influencing survival.\r"

Both node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+) patients had an improvement of survival rates at 10 years of the same magnitude: 6.8% and 5.9% respectively. Taking into consideration both the maximum diameter of the primary tumor and the status of axillary nodes it was found that in (1) both N- and N+ patients with a primary tumor of no more than 2 cm in greatest diameter, the improvement of survival was not statistically significant; and (2) both N- and N+ patients with a primary greater than 2 cm in maximum diameter had a better chance of survival in the second time period.\r"

Both groups had normal cardiac function at rest. Patients who had not received anthracyclines had a greater increase in M-mode shortening fraction (P less than 0.005), velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (P = 0.05), and Doppler aortic peak flow velocity (P = 0.01) than patients receiving anthracyclines. There were no significant differences in work performed, or increase in heart rate or blood pressure with exercise between the groups. These results suggest that subtle abnormalities in myocardial function exist which become apparent only after exercise in survivors of childhood cancer who have received anthracyclines and have normal resting cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease has seldom been investigated because of analytic difficulties. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are oxidized simultaneously at either ring A or ring D, and the rate of catechol estrogen formation (r2) is reciprocally related to the rate of 16 alpha-hydroxylation (r3). The rate of ovarian estrogen production (X10) can be summarized as to metabolic outcome: X10 = r10 + r2 + r3 + r(u), where r10 is the loss of E1 and E2 in urine, and ru is the fecal and urinary loss of unknown oxidative products. Assuming a constant r(u) between subjects: constancy of the X10 concentration between subjects during similar menstrual cycle phases. In the absence of xenobiotics, r2 x r3 are reciprocally interrelated: r2 x r3 = K (an oxidation constant whose limiting factor is the biologically available estrogen at the cell surface). To the extent that r10 approximates estrogens available for cellular metabolism, the rate of catechol estrogen metabolism may be determined from (Formula; see text) From published data K = 12.4 +/- 0.8 of the standard error of the mean. Pearson correlation coefficients between actual and estimated catechol estrogen excretion in groups of subjects ranged from 0.61 to 0.97 (median, 0.88). This method has been useful for clinical investigation of the relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease until better methods to measure catechol estrogen directly are available.\r"

Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area. The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03).

Gross thrombus formation was confirmed upon removal of the guidewire. The activated clotting time was found to be 191 s, suggesting heparin resistance. This report graphically illustrates the potential thrombogenicity associated with intravascular guidewire manipulation during procedures such as intravascular ultrasound imaging and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Moreover, this case suggests that adequate heparinization should be routinely verified by measuring the activated clotting time prior to introducing a guidewire into the arterial system.\r"

  ".U": "91300532\r", 
  ".W": "Hemodynamic changes due to intracoronary injections of nonionic contrast medium Omnipaque-350 (OM), ionic dimer Hexabrix (HB), and ionic contrast medium Renografin-76 (R76) were compared at baseline and during reperfusion after a 30-minute left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. In 11 open chest, anesthetized, and atrially paced dogs, 4 ml of either OM, HB, R76, or 0.9% NaCl were injected into the carotid-LAD bypass system. Coronary blood flow (CBF) and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) were measured before, during and after the intracoronary injection. The maximal hyperemic change (in percentage) from the preinjection value of CBF and CVR were calculated. The results at baseline and during reperfusion for CBF were: 104 +/- 14% vs. 85 +/- 10% for OM (NS); 76 +/- 11% vs. 39 +/- 9% for R76 (p less than 0.05); 57 +/- 8% vs. 33 +/- 5% for HB (P less than 0.05); and 30 +/- 7% vs. 9 +/- 4% for 0.9% NaCl (p less than 0.05). Consequently, the hyperemic changes of CVR at baseline and during reperfusion were: -49 +/- 3 vs. -42 +/- 4% for OM (NS); -44 +/- 3% vs. -24 +/- 6% for R76 (p less than 0.01); -36 +/- 3% vs. -24 +/- 4% for HB (p less than 0.05); and -18 +/- 4% vs. -7 +/- 3% for 0.9% NaCl (p less than 0.05). Thus, ischemia and reperfusion significantly dampened the coronary hemodynamic and vascular response to R76, HB, and 0.9% NaCl but not to OM. The preserved coronary vascular reserve with high flow in this canine post-ischemic reperfusion model may explain the advantage of nonionic over ionic contrast media used in emergency coronary angiography following thrombolysis.\r"

In 96 patients with mitral stenosis, the disparity between the 2 formulae was greater than 0.2 cm2 in 43 (45%) and greater than or equal to 0.35 cm2 in 21 (22%). The results of the simplified formula were especially likely to be disparate from those of the Gorlin equation in those whose heart rates were greater than 100 beats/minute. Thus, in the patient with mitral stenosis, the simplified formula should be used with caution and cognizance of its potential inaccuracy, particularly if the patient is tachycardic.\r"

Primary success of PTCA was achieved in 95%. Those treated with long balloons required fewer inflations (3.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.7 +/- 2.1, P = .0001) and showed fewer moderate or severe intimal dissections of the lesions (4/22 vs. 12/22, p = .028).

Seventeen native vessels (9 pre-PTCA and 8 post-PTCA) and sixteen saphenous vein grafts (12 pre-PTCA and 4 post-PTCA) were treated. All vessels were patent at the time of perfusion wire placement. Complete thrombus resolution, successful PTCA and sustained patency was seen in 31 of 33 patients. One native vessel treated post PTCA (originally occluded) re-occluded. One saphenous vein graft treated prior to PTCA showed improvement in thrombus but distal embolization with balloon inflation occurred. No significant complications related to the intracoronary infusion technique were observed. In conclusion, rapid lysis of intra-coronary thrombus can be accomplish safely using this technique and can result in improved PTCA outcome.\r"

Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas. Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance. Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains. Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas. This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study.\r"

The remainder either did not need a hearing aid or required further investigation and surgical or medical treatment. In addition there was significant evidence of lack of expertise amongst General Practitioners in recognizing ear disorders. It is imperative that any patient requiring a hearing aid be seen by someone experienced in otology rather than be dealt with by the General Practitioner alone.\r"

This hyper-responsiveness could not be demonstrated in patients with perennial non-allergic rhinitis, unless the patients were selected according to the predominant symptoms in the history. Patients with rhinorrhoea ('runners') proved to be hyper-responsive to methacholine compared with normal controls. The existence of two subpopulations was emphasized by hyper-responsiveness to both histamine and methacholine in the runners group compared with the patients with a stuffy nose ('blockers'). Patients with chronic nasal infections (characterized by recurrent episodes of purulent discharge) showed no hyper-responsiveness at all, indicating that either hyper-reactivity does not play an important part in this patient population or methods to detect hyper-reactivity in this group are inadequate. In contrast to our earlier observations in patients with atopic rhinitis, increased responsiveness to phentolamine could not be detected either in the patients with perennial rhinitis or in the patients with infectious rhinitis, indicating that the possible alpha-adrenergic dysfunction found in patients with atopic rhinitis is restricted to this group.\r"

The temperature relations of the latency of wave V are described by the regression equation: Latency (ms) = 11.06-0.146 x temp. (degrees C).

Tympanometry was carried out just before and after diving. The divers made 104 dives between them (median 5 each, range 2-7) at depths from 2 to 12 m (median 6 m). The results showed a significant increase in middle ear compliance on diving. The increase in compliance was significant at different depths, was transient, and fell to the initial level between the dives. We conclude that the strain exerted on the tympanic membrane and middle ear from barotrauma due to diving results in a reversible impairment of the recoiling capacity of the elastic fibrils of the tympanic membrane. This transient increase in compliance, we think, is the first measurable change in elasticity of the tympanic membrane. If barotrauma continue the changes could be irreversible.\r"

  ".W": "The monitoring of children with otitis media with effusion ties up considerable resources in audiology departments. Impedance audiometry is frequently used when investigating these children. It has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting middle ear effusion, but its value in identifying those children with a significant hearing impairment secondary to this is in question because of the wide range of hearing impairments possible with a type B tympanogram. This study quantified the sensitivity and specificity of impedance audiometry in detecting a hearing impairment greater than or equal to 25 dB HL due to otitis media with effusion. The subjects were 285 children of whom 20% had hearing thresholds greater than or equal to 25 dB HL. A peaked tympanogram (types A or C) virtually eliminated the possibility (98% confidence) of such a hearing impairment. A flat type B tympanogram was satisfactorily sensitive (93%) in detecting a hearing impairment, but non-specific (76%). The positive predictive value was 49%, i.e. 51% of ears with this type of tympanogram had hearing within acceptable limits. Assuming that a sensorineural impairment has been excluded and a population is being monitored for hearing impairment associated with otitis media with effusion, it is suggested that the presence of a peaked tympanogram indicates normal hearing, whereas those children with a flat tympanogram would require their hearing to be evaluated. Increased use of impedance audiometry to monitor children with otitis media with effusion would reduce the number requiring full pure-tone audiometry with a subsequent reduction in the workload of an audiology department.\r"

Seven patients were treated by primary radiotherapy and one by primary endoscopic laser excision. Four of those treated with radiotherapy developed recurrent disease which was treated by radical surgery in three and by endoscopic laser excision in one. The place of radiotherapy in the management of this condition requires further evaluation in view of the high rate of recurrence. Endoscopic laser excision may be a reasonable alternative to more radical surgery in this highly differentiated neoplasm.\r"

Comparison with a similar survey done in the same valley in 1977 revealed an apparent reduction in the prevalence of hearing loss and the prevalence of otitis media. This improvement appears to be due to a reduced prevalence of otitis media. An unexpected finding was that at least 2% of the children had a bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment.\r"

CEA levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced, e.g. stage IV, disease but a correlation between serum CEA concentration and prognosis was not found. Patients who smoked had significantly higher serum CEA levels than non-smoking patients. In the serial determinations slight CEA elevations could be found in only 50% of patients with tumour recurrence. Combined with the data from the literature we conclude that serum CEA determination is not useful in predicting the outcome in patients with a head and neck squamous carcinoma.\r"

All were asked to complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and a 12-item Throat Symptom Questionnaire. Seventy-two of these patients were sent a follow-up General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Replies were received from 89 patients (86%), 68 females and 21 males, a mean of 31 months after initial presentation. The feeling of something stuck in the throat had disappeared completely in 27% of patients, but only 4% were never aware of the throat. Throat symptoms showed a reduction with increasing age, but not with increasing interval since presentation. The 15 patients initially treated with antacid therapy had significantly greater dyspepsia scores at review than untreated patients, but no other difference was found between the two groups. GHQ scores showed a small but significant reduction over time. Of EPQ parameters, only the lower lie score in female patients showed any significant difference on repeat testing. Those with persistently high throat scores had significantly lower EPQ lie scores and a trend towards higher GHQ scores at follow-up. None of the psychological parameters measured at the first interview was found to be of prognostic significance. We conclude that, although there is a reduction in occult psychiatric morbidity in patients with the globus sensation over time, underlying personality traits remain stable and that there is a remarkable persistence of pharyngeal symptoms.\r"

Diagnosis was altered or added to in 79% of cases and management in 73% of cases. The trend after knowledge of antroscopic findings was towards more medical treatment and less surgical intervention. Such a change would clearly have significant resource implications.

True hypochlorhydria was defined as a peak acid output in response to a maximally effective stimulant of acid secretion that was below the lower limit of normal for 365 consecutive healthy subjects. In these healthy subjects, average basal pH was 2.16 +/- 0.09 in men and 2.79 +/- 0.18 in women. In 109 consecutive experiments in 28 subjects with true hypochlorhydria, fasting gastric pH averaged 7.44 +/- 0.11 in men and 7.65 +/- 0.33 in women. Fasting pH exceeded the upper 95% confidence limit of normal (5.09 in men and 6.81 in women) in 102 of the 109 experiments (94%).

Oral administration of acidified ethanol (60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl, 1 ml) produced hemorrhagic bandlike lesions in the gastric mucosa. Pretreatment of the animals with orally administered NEM (0.1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited these lesions (the inhibition was over 80% at 1 mg/kg or greater), and the effects were partially reversed by indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). However, when NEM (10 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously, this agent significantly worsened the lesions. Intragastrically applied NEM produced a dose-dependent reduction of the transmucosal potential difference (PD) and the mucosal nonprotein SH levels, an increase of the volume of gastric contents, and an inhibition of gastric motility, while these parameters remained unaltered after subcutaneous administration of the agent. The microvascular permeability in the mucosa was significantly increased by both oral and subcutaneous administration of NEM (10 mg/kg) but remained unchanged in response to lower doses of orally administered (less than 3 mg/kg). These results suggest that NEM given orally is cytoprotective to the stomach against ethanol, probably by acting as a mild irritant and due to dilution of an irritant and inhibition of gastric motility (muscle relaxation), but when given subcutaneously it aggravates the lesions by unknown mechanisms.\r"

In four dogs, duodenal perfusion and aspiration catheters were implanted, and serosal electrodes were placed along the proximal small bowel. Control studies of gastric emptying, output of bile acids and amylase, and plasma concentrations of peptide YY and neurotensin were performed on three occasions following ingestion of a 340-kcal mixed-nutrient liquid meal. The dogs then underwent our model of in situ jejunoileal neural isolation, and the meal studies were repeated. Neural isolation, when compared to control, did not affect either postprandial conversion of intestinal myoelectric activity to the \"fed\" pattern, gastric emptying (T1/2, X +/- SE of the liquid meal (74 +/- 6 vs 79 +/- 7 min; P greater than 0.05), or cumulative amylase output (373 +/- 59 vs 305 +/- 66 kU; P greater than 0.05). Neural isolation decreased cumulative postprandial bile acid output from 6.6 +/- 0.9 mM to 3.4 +/- 1.1 mM (P less than 0.05) and increased postprandial plasma concentrations of peptide YY and neurotensin. Our findings suggest that the jejunoileal denervation that accompanies the in situ neural isolation of the jejunoileum is not associated with changes in postprandial motility patterns, gastric emptying, or pancreatic amylase secretion. Loss of this innervation, however, may decrease postprandial output of bile acids and lead to a compensatory increase in the postprandial release of neurotensin and peptide YY.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of perfusion of the colon with a fatty acid (oleic acid) on peptone-stimulated gastric acid secretion and release of gastrin in conscious dogs. Gastric acid secretion was monitored by continuous intragastric titration. Perfusion of the colon with sodium oleate (24 mmol/hr) inhibited gastric acid secretion (14.2 +/- 2.6 meq/hr) stimulated by a peptone meal (1%) significantly (P less than 0.05) when compared to perfusion of the colon with saline alone (20.1 +/- 1.6 meq/hr). The serum elevation in gastrin in response to intragastric instillation of the peptone meal was not affected by the colonic perfusion of oleic acid. Plasma concentrations of peptide YY (PYY) increased significantly in response to perfusion of the colon with saline or sodium oleate, and the integrated release of PYY in response to sodium oleate [6.9 +/- 2.8 ng (60-120) min/ml] was significantly greater than the response to saline [3.1 +/- 0.7 ng (60-120) min/ml]. The results of this study indicate that inhibition of gastric acid secretion by perfusion of the colon with fat is not due to an inhibition of gastrin release. In addition, because PYY is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, it is possible that PYY participates as an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion by the colon.\r"

Inflation to 200 ml had no significant effect on intake (0.31 MJ/kg/day), whereas inflation to 500 ml significantly reduced energy intake to 0.14 MJ/kg/day (P less than 0.0001). An intragastric balloon does create aversion to feeding, presumably by producing satiety, but the effect is volume dependent.\r"

  ".W": "To test whether omeprazole would increase the susceptibility of the duodenum to damage, 200 to 250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 10 mg/kg of omeprazole (Losec) by gavage every morning for 29 days. Control rats were given gavage buffer alone. After fasting overnight, half the rats received 10 mg/kg indomethacin intraperitoneally; then all rats were given 2 ml of 50% ethanol by gavage. Three hours later the rats were killed and the stomach and duodenum removed and histologic injury to the duodenal mucosal was quantitated. In omeprazole pretreated rats, gavage with ethanol resulted in a significant twofold worsening of duodenal injury. Pretreatment with indomethacin to decrease endogenous prostaglandin production resulted in more severe ethanol-induced duodenal injury in both groups; however, there were no longer statistically significant differences between the omeprazole and control groups. Measurement of duodenal mucosal synthesis of prostaglandin E2 showed no difference between the omeprazole and control groups. Thus chronic administration of omeprazole appears to increase the susceptibility of the duodenal mucosa to ethanol injury in rats. The mechanism of this effect is as yet unknown but does not appear to be prostaglandin-mediated.\r"

The ulcer was completely healed in 27 (amantadine), 26 (bromocriptine), 23 (cimetidine), and in 24 (famotidine) patients. Relapse was noted in 34.7% (cimetidine) and 25% (famotidine) versus 11.7% (amantadine) and 7.7% (bromocriptine) DU patients. No significant difference was found in initial healing rates. However, the relapse rate in the cimetidine-treated group was significantly higher than in all the other test groups. Additional comparisons between all the treatment categories showed a significantly lower relapse rate with the dopamine-like agents. These important new results indicate that dopamine-like compounds are equally effective as H2 blockers in inducing DU healing and may offer a promising advantage over H2 blockers concerning their efficacy in preventing ulcer relapse in DU patients.\r"

In the alcoholics various parameters such as ethanol consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and alcoholic neuropathy were determined and related to gastrointestinal transit times. Although there was no significant overall difference of gastric emptying, abnormally delayed gastric emptying was detected in 23.9% of the alcoholics but no control subject (P less than 0.005). Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly prolonged in the alcoholics (P less than 0.001) with 14 alcoholics (37.8%) disclosing delayed mouth-to-cecum transit. No significant differences between both groups were detected concerning whole gut transit. In the alcoholics there was a significant correlation of dyspeptic symptoms with delayed gastric emptying (P less than 0.006), and alcoholics with diarrhea had an accelerated mouth-to-cecum transit as compared to those without diarrhea (P less than 0.05). Neither the presence of autonomic or peripheral neuropathy nor the presence of liver cirrhosis or ascites was significantly related to gastrointestinal transit times. However, the daily ethanol ingestion significantly correlated with gastric emptying (P less than 0.005). It is concluded, therefore, that in chronic alcoholics the small intestine and the stomach are most likely to be affected by gastrointestinal transit disorders and that these transit abnormalities are potentially related to toxic damage of gastrointestinal smooth muscle.\r"

Through the combined use of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, adenomatous polyps were detected in 47 of 114 individuals (41%). A total of 88 adenomas was found. Seventeen patients had isolated neoplasms in proximal colonic segments in the absence of distal adenomas. These patients represented 15% of screened subjects (17 of 114) and 20% of individuals who lacked adenomas on sigmoidoscopy (17 of 84). The majority of proximal neoplasms were small (less than 1.0 cm), tubular adenomas. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for screening asymptomatic men for neoplasia. However, it remains to be determined if a 20% miss rate (for those with a normal sigmoidoscopic examination) is significant and whether small proximal adenomas are worth finding.\r"

In these healthy individuals, a high-fiber diet had no effect on mucosal bleeding, but the increased fecal weight significantly lowered fecal hemoglobin concentration. Clinical implications are considered.\r"

The results were: (1) Endocrine tumors and similar lesions were found in 3% or 24 cases (25 lesions). Twenty lesions (20 cases) were found to be tumors and five lesions (five cases) were determined to be hyperplasia of Langerhans islets. (2) Incidence of tumor was 10% (6/60) in individuals having histological studies of all sections of the pancreas, and 1.6% (12/738) in individuals having histological studies of three random sections of the pancreas. (3) None of the cases with tumors and hyperplastic lesions showed symptoms of hormone production. (4) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed hormone production in all 20 tumor cases and multiple hormone production was found in 14 of these (70%). (5) Ductular or tubular structures were found in or adjacent to the tumors in 12 cases (60%) and hyperplasia in one case (20%). Langerhans islets, 500 microns or larger in size, were found in three lesions of the tumor (15%). Langerhans islets with the mean diameter of normal islets + 2 SD or larger also were found around five tumors (25%) and three hyperplasias (60%). The above findings suggest that endocrine tumors of the pancreas are prevalent and that they do not produce symptoms of excessive hormone production even though they do continue to produce hormones. Some of the endocrine tumors or hyperplasias develop from totipotent stem cells of the duct epithelia, and factors promoting the growth of Langerhans islets might exist.\r"

The geographic distribution of HCC is highly uneven, such that three distinct incidence areas are recognized. To clarify the reason(s) for this geographic variability of HCC, the risk factors in each incidence area were assessed. In parallel with the geographic distribution of HCC, HBsAg prevalence was highest in both HCC patients and in general population in Africa and Asia, where mothers of HCC patients are frequently HBsAg-positive, suggesting that hepatitis B virus hyperendemicity and perinatal infection account for the high HCC incidence in these areas. Cirrhosis, which is found on autopsy in 80% of the cases of HCC patients worldwide, is the most prevalent risk factor for HCC in areas where hepatitis B virus infection is less common. However, HBsAg carriage adds to the HCC risk carried by cirrhosis and explains the higher incidence of HCC in cirrhotics from Africa and Asia as well as elsewhere. Available data suggest that chronic HCV infection is a risk factor for cirrhosis and HCC. HBV vaccination should decrease HCC incidence rates worldwide; however, HCC prevention in regions where HBsAg carriage is infrequent may also require prevention of the other causes of cirrhosis in order for HCC rates to decline.\r"

Hepatocyte proliferation is central not only at the late steps in carcinogenesis, the cancer, but at the earliest known step, initiation. Compensatory or regenerative hepatocyte proliferation is essential to initiation with chemical carcinogens but primary hyperplasia is ineffective. During promotion, hepatocyte proliferation is the major change seen as clonal proliferation to generate nodules occurs. During progression, autonomous hepatocyte proliferation balanced by cell loss makes its appearance. This continues in a balanced fashion with only a slight excess of proliferation over loss until the earlier steps in malignancy at which time the balance is disrupted.\r"

Two other models have been described recently in the literature, in which development of hepatic neoplastic lesions occurs after protracted periods of liver cell injury, death, and regeneration, without exposure of the animals to chemical carcinogens. The possibility is considered that an abnormal increase in cell turnover may result in all of the genomic alterations that are required for initiation, promotion, and neoplastic transformation of liver cells in these models of hepatocarcinogenesis. The possible involvement, in the same models, of endogenously initiated liver cells also is discussed briefly.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that hepatoma (HCC) cells produce abnormal proteins such as erytropietin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and, recently, antithrombin III (AT III). In a preliminary report, we reported increased AT III levels in patients bearing HCC independent of their clinical liver status. The present study was performed to assess antithrombin III levels and other serological data present in patients with cirrhosis and in patients with cirrhosis and clinical findings of neoplastic disease. In 70 well-matched patients (47 with cirrhosis and 23 with cirrhosis and proven HCC) serum total cholesterol, albumin, prothrombin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, aminotransferases, and AT III were determined. Together with AFP and alkaline phosphatase, patients with HCC had higher values of AT III (88 +/- 7%) and total cholesterol (184 +/- 17 mg/100 ml), as compared with cirrhotic patients (AT III 56 +/- 3.6%; total cholesterol 113 +/- 5 mg/100 ml) (P less than 0.001). No difference was observed between these two groups for albumin, prothrombin, and aminotransferases. In HCC patients, AT III levels were related to the total cholesterol level (R2 = 0.317), whereas in the cirrhotic patients it correlated with the prothrombin level (R2 = 0.274). These data suggest that in HCC patients a greater rate of synthesis of AT III occurs, whereas in cirrhotic patients lower levels of AT III occur due to impaired synthesis or increased catabolism of the protein. The serial determination of AT III in cirrhotic patients as a means of detecting neoplastic transformation is suggested.\r"

Tumor diameter in those with hepatic cancer was assessed by angio-CT. Only ALF and AFP were significantly greater in patients with PHC and PHC + LC patients as compared to patients with LC alone. At an accepted cutoff level of 500 ng/ml, the AFP level provided 43% false negative tests. On the other hand, an ALF level exceeding 740 mumol/hr/ml provided a sensitivity of 84% with a specificity of 94%. No relationship between the ALF level and Child's criteria or with any liver injury parameter was evident. Considering all individual values, the ALF, rather than the AFP, correlated with tumor size. This finding suggests the ALF level may be of value in the early detection of PHC as well as in the follow-up of patients treated for PHC.\r"

  ".U": "91300983\r", 
  ".W": "The basic motor function of the colon is to mix and knead its contents, propel them slowly in the caudad direction, hold them in the distal colon until defecation, and provide a strong propulsive force during defecation. Infrequently, it also produces mass movements in the proximal colon. These motor functions are achieved in most species by three different types of contractions: the individual phasic contractions that include the short- and long-duration contractions, organized groups of contractions that include the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes, and special propulsive contractions (giant migrating contractions). The spatial and temporal patterns of all of these contractions are controlled by myogenic, neural, and chemical control mechanisms. The individual phasic contractions are highly disorganized in time and space in the colon. For this reason, they are effective in mixing and kneading and slow distal propulsion. The underlying cause of the disorganization of short duration contractions is the irregularity in the frequency and waveshape of colonic electrical control activity and its phase unlocking throughout the colon. The individual contractions in many species occur in cyclic bursts called contractile states. At least in some species, these contractile states exhibit mostly caudad and sometimes orad migration. However, there are also nonmigrating or randomly migrating contractile states in the colon. These two patterns of contractile states are called colonic migrating motor complexes and colonic nonmigrating motor complexes, respectively. The giant migrating contractions provide the strong propulsive force for defecation and mass movements. The neural control of colonic contractions is organized at three levels--enteric, autonomic, and central. The enteric nervous system contains cholinergic and peptidergic neurons and plays a major role in the control of colonic contractions. The autonomic nerves, the vagi, pelvic, lumbar colonic, hypogastric, and splanchnic nerves, seem to continuously monitor the state of the colon and provide a modulatory input when necessary. These nerves play a major role in the reflexive control of colonic motor function. The voluntary input from the central nervous system coordinates the motor activity of the colon, rectum, anal canal and sphincters for orderly evacuation of feces during defecation. The role of acetylcholine, nonadrenaline, and the yet to be completely identified nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter, possibly VIP, in the control of contractions is fairly well established. Besides these, there are several other peptides and chemicals that are localized in the colonic wall; their physiological roles remain unknown. Colonic motor activity has been studied in several disease states. The findings have not always been consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Interhospital transport is necessary for a large percentage of critically ill or injured children. The appropriateness of care received during the transport phase is a crucial component of the critical care continuum. There are few widely applicable or accepted standards in place for pediatric transport, partly because standards are in the developmental phase and partly because of the lack of uniformity of resources available in different geographical regions. A common sense approach to providing appropriate patient care should be used, keeping in mind the philosophic and practical considerations detailed above. The best interest of the individual patient should be the primary factor in making any transport decision.\r"

  ".W": "Recognition of the high-risk mother and fetus is an essential component of resuscitation if it is to be organized, accurate, and successful. Although many high-risk factors put the neonate in jeopardy, the first responder or ED physician can plan the initial approach to resuscitation by knowing the answer to three questions: (1) Is there particulate meconium in the amniotic fluid? (2) Is the fetus/baby premature? and (3) Is a multiple gestation pregnancy expected? Although the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation, chemical) of resuscitation adequately describe the parameters essential for adequate resuscitation, they do not relate to the actions necessary to accomplish this feat; therefore, it is important for participants in neonatal resuscitation to remember the acronym SOS--suction, oxygen, stimulation. Even infants with moderate depression (occasional respiratory effort) will generally respond to brief suctioning of the airway, 100% oxygen, and vigorous stimulation. If SOS is ineffective, PPV must be administered without hesitation. Resuscitation of the newborn is not a simple procedure, but rather a dynamic process involving continuous evaluation, action, and reassessment before, during, and after the actual resuscitation. A specially trained resuscitation team of physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist interacting in a dynamic evaluation approach is ideal but not practical for most community hospitals. Each hospital must develop its own protocol and train and maintain its resuscitation personnel. If each member of the team is prepared to take over in the absence of the others, neonatal resuscitation will remain fast, organized, and accurate.\r"

In this paper, we have reviewed our own work and that of others on the role of tubal ampullary cells (cocultures) to mimic the in vivo environment to bring about improved embryo quality and an increased number of blastocysts for replacement in IVF patients. The establishment, maintenance, and behavior of human tubal cell lines is first presented, followed by their use as cocultures for fertilization and cleavage of embryos. The mode of action, specificity, and cryopreservation of ampullary cells are also discussed. The currently available results of pregnancies after cocultures are presented together with future aspects of research that are necessary to refine the coculture system. The ultimate aim is to mimic in vivo conditions in vitro, so that at least the PRs of assisted conception can be parallel to normal fecundity in the human. Therefore, a very attractive future includes the freezing of blastocysts generated from coculture, thawing, and replacing them in natural cycles.\r"

Patients with bilateral proximal tubal obstruction underwent fallopian tube recanalization under ultrasonic observation. SETTING: This study represents patients evaluated for primary or secondary infertility at Humboldt University Hospital. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Proximal tubal obstruction had been diagnosed on previous hysterosalpingogram and with laparoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Tubal patency was assessed by hydrotubation under ultrasonic observation. RESULTS: Transvaginal catheterization was successful in 31 (91.2%) of the 34 tubes. In 19 patients with proximal tubal obstruction, patency of both or at least one tube was achieved in 16 (84.2%) women. Five (31.6%) of 16 patients successfully recanalized were found to have an intrauterine pregnancy at a 6-month follow-up interval. CONCLUSION: This catheterization technique should be investigated for possible use in diagnostic schedule early in the evaluation of the infertile patient. Also, the transvaginal recanalization of proximally obstructed tubes calls into question the application of microsurgical treatment of a selected group of patients.\r"

PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were studied, of which 113 had an intrauterine pregnancy and 19 had an ectopic pregnancy (EP). RESULTS: In 78 with singleton normal pregnancies, US revealed a normal crown-rump length, heart motion, and hCG levels between 1,000 to 107,000 mIU/mL. Of 16 patients with small crown-rump length, heart motion present, and normal hCG levels, 6 aborted and 10 reached term. Thus, 6 of 84 (7.14%) singleton with fetal heart motion aborted. Thirteen with small crown-rump and absent heart motion also aborted. All 8 with an empty gestational sac aborted. In 8, transvaginal US detected four twins, two triplets, and two quadruplets, whereas hCG was not discriminative. Transvaginal US revealed an empty uterus in 19 patients with an EP, whereas serum hCG varied between 37 and 10,500 mIU/mL. CONCLUSION: A fetal crown-rump length compatible with gestational age and fetal heart motion seen by transvaginal US can predict a term pregnancy in greater than 90% of patients.\r"

DESIGN: All patients with twin pregnancies between 1985 and 1989 were prospectively studied. Human chorionic gonadotropin was measured one to three times per week between days 12 and 52 after luteinizing hormone (LH) surge or day of hCG administration (day 0). Pelvic ultrasound (US) was performed weekly beginning on day 24. SETTING: The study was performed at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in an academic private practice setting of the Section of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. PATIENTS: Forty patients who conceived after treatment of infertility and who had two gestational sacs on US examination were included in the study after the following criteria were met: (1) both sacs progressed to exhibit a fetal pole and (2) day of LH surge and/or day of hCG administration was known. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The rate of rise of hCG was slower in vanishing twin pregnancies than in normally progressing twin gestations for the entire time period studied (P less than 0.05). RESULTS: A vanishing twin occurred in one third of the twin pregnancies. Forty-six percent of these losses occurred after fetal heart activity had been established. CONCLUSIONS: Vanishing twin phenomenon occurred in a large proportion of twin pregnancies in this infertility population. Fetal heart activity was not a reliable predictor of continuing fetal viability in early twin gestations. Vanishing twin conceptions were characterized by a slower rate of rise of hCG than normally progressing twin pregnancies.\r"

DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 241 cases with laparoscopically or laparotomically confirmed peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis consecutively admitted to three teaching hospitals in Northern Italy. The control group consisted of 437 women admitted to hospitals for acute conditions covering similar catchment areas. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the risk of endometriosis decreased with increasing number of births: the point estimates were 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, for those with one and two or more births (X2(1) trend = 50.3, P less than 0.001). No relation emerged with age at first birth and spontaneous miscarriages. Relative to women whose menarche occurred at age 11 or younger, the risk of endometriosis was slightly lower in those who experienced later menarche, but the trend in risk was not significant. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a lower frequency of the disease (relative risk, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5). The role of various factors was largely similar for different disease locations (ovary, peritoneum, and both) and indication for diagnostic surgery (sterility, pelvic pain, and other reasons). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that parity and irregular/long menses lower the risk of endometriosis. These findings were similar in different subgroups of disease location and indication for surgery, giving strong evidence of the consistency of the general results.\r"

DESIGN: Duplicate endometrial biopsies from 25 women were dated by five evaluators on two separate occasions to evaluate the overall precision of the measure. Using variance component analysis, estimates of intrauterine, intraevaluator, and interevaluator variability were determined. SETTING: Samples were obtained during outpatient fertility testing. Evaluators were colleagues at the same institution. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Women presenting with infertility undergoing routine evaluation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Variability in histologic dating of the endometrium. RESULTS: Inconsistencies between evaluators accounted for 65% of the observed variability, whereas 27% was because of inconsistencies in duplicate readings by the same evaluator. Regional differences in the uterus accounted for only 8% of the total variability. CONCLUSIONS: The overall error from these sources have the potential to result in a substantial false-positive rate for diagnosis of luteal phase defect.\r"

Diagnosis of LPD was based on determinations of serum P and premenstrual endometrial biopsy. SETTING: From Cairo University Hospitals. PATIENT, PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six women with LPD and 8 normal fertile women (controls) were chosen. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: beta-Endorphin, P, E2, and PRL concentrations were determined by the corresponding 125I radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Plasma beta-endorphin level in cases of LPD varied from 2.58 to 9.14 pmol/L, whereas the level of controls varied from 2.41 to 5.57 pmol/L. The mean value of plasma beta-endorphin in cases of LPD was significantly higher than that of controls by 146% (P less than 0.0005). In spite of the significant decrease of serum P in cases of LPD, serum E2 level did not differ significantly from that of controls. CONCLUSION: The possible sources of beta-endorphin rise and its implication in the etiology of LPD are explained.\r"

DESIGN: We retrospectively compared the gender outcome of conceptions of couples who conceived spontaneously with those who conceived secondary to an insemination with separated semen. SETTING: Private practice of one author (M.A.K.). PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: The study group consisted of 48 pregnancies of couples who conceived by the separation technique. The control group consisted of 46 pregnancies of couples who initially presented for consultation for gender selection but conceived spontaneously. INTERVENTIONS: In the study group, one timed intrauterine insemination with separated semen was performed per cycle, with a mean of 2.3 cycles per couple. Patients desiring a female were also treated with clomiphene citrate and human chorionic gonadotropin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The gender outcome of the pregnancies of the two groups was evaluated based on the known desired gender. RESULTS: The success rate for conceiving a desired male was 56.5% in the study group and 60.9% in the control group (P = 1.000).

The aim of the study was to measure the presence of cytokines, namely interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the conditioned medium (CM) of the oocytes, granulosa cells, cumulus cells, one to eight-cell embryos and sperm. DESIGN: The material was obtained from men and women undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We hypothesized that cytokines might affect embryonic growth and differentiation as they show a pleotropic effect on immune cells. RESULTS: All these cytokines are present in significant quantities in the CM and were shown to be expressed in a sequential manner; thus, some are present in the oocyte and its vestment, the corona-cumulus complex (IL-1, IL-6, and CSF-1), whereas TNF appears only at the stage of six to eight-cell embryos. Inflammatory cytokines could not be detected in sperm samples. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that these cytokines have a role in the regulation of embryonic development, maternal immunological recognition of pregnancy, and maintenance of proper hormonal environment.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Multiple follicular development was induced with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationships among FF steroid hormone, morphological maturity of oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes, and fertilization and cleavage of oocytes. RESULTS: Follicles with mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes and unfertilized oocytes contained significantly greater amounts of A (P less than 0.05) than those with mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes and fertilized ova, indicating the occurrence of atretic changes. Follicles yielding successfully fertilized and cleaved ova had significantly greater amounts of P (P less than 0.05) and A (P less than 0.01) but similar levels of 17 beta-estradiol compared with follicles yielding fertilized ova that failed to cleave. CONCLUSIONS: Follicles yielding oocytes that cleaved as a result of IVF have both a shift in steroidogenesis from estrogen to progestin accumulation and declining aromatase activity, thus reflecting progressive luteinization of the follicles.\r"

DESIGN: Twenty-two couples who failed at least one in vitro fertilization attempt because of lack of oocytes fertilization underwent a zona-slitting micromanipulative procedure. A total of 245 oocytes were retrieved and inseminated by three different modes: 151 oocytes underwent micromanipulation, 2 were damaged, and the remaining 149 inseminated by the husband's sperm (group A). Fifty-five oocytes were not manipulated and inseminated by the husband's sperm (group B), and 39 oocytes were not manipulated and inseminated by a donor sperm (group C). RESULTS: Fertilization rates were 26.8%, 5.5%, and 53.8% in groups A, B, and C, respectively, and differed significantly between group A and group B. The cleavage rates were lower for oocytes fertilized by the husband's sperm (48.6%) than that obtained by donor (90%), suggesting a sperm factor contributing to this phenomenon. The procedure was most efficient in patients with a total motile sperm count after preparation of greater than or equal to 5 million and with either normal sperm morphology or defects localized to the acrosome or tail region only. Sperm with nuclear morphological abnormalities demonstrated a marked reduction in fertilization potential. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the zona-slitting technique enhances fertilization of severely subfertile sperm, and its efficacy is affected by sperm morphology and a threshold concentration of motile cells.\r"

DESIGN: A sensitive enzyme immunoassay was used to determine half-lives of rTNF and confirm concentrations of cytokine throughout experimental conditions. Effect of rTNF on human sperm survival was measured by computer-assisted methodology, and effect on human sperm penetration was assessed by hamster ova penetration. Cytokine effect on murine gamete interaction was determined by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Murine preimplantation development was assessed by in vitro development of cryopreserved-thawed one-cell zygotes. RESULTS: The half-life of rTNF was reduced by the addition of sperm to culture media (P less than 0.001). Sperm motility (P = 0.245) and hamster ova penetration (P = 0.62) were not altered by incubations in the presence of concentrations of rTNF up to 10,000 U/mL. Mouse IVF (P = 0.60) and preimplantation development (P = 0.56) were not altered by rTNF in concentrations up to 5,000 U/mL.

Peritoneal fluid (PF) volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation, as well as the number of implants with adhesions, were compared with values obtained during the initial surgery. The effect of hormonal treatment on these factors was evaluated at a third laparotomy. RESULTS: There was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of adhesions in animals with endometrial implants. Peritoneal fluid volume, macrophage number, or macrophage activation were not increased in rabbits with endometrial implants as compared with controls, nor was there a response to hormonal manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PF volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation are not altered by endometrial implants in the rabbit model.

DESIGN: Thirty sexually mature female rabbits were randomly assigned to one of three surgical groups. The injury consisted of a linear incision along the long axis of both ovaries, from the cortex to the hilum, followed by immediate unilateral oophorectomy for evaluation of the acute tissue damage. The opposite ovary was left in situ to evaluate subsequent healing, steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, and ovulation. RESULTS: Minimal damage was observed after surgery with either laser or microelectrode. The ovarian stroma and follicles adjacent to the surgical site appeared normal both immediately and 15 days after all surgeries. Steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, and luteinization were similar among the three groups. The number of ovulated oocytes after human chorionic gonadotropin was significantly reduced after scalpel and laser surgery compared with microelectrode (P less than 0.05). The former groups appeared to have a higher incidence of unruptured luteinized follicles with untrapped oocytes, which were often covered with a cellular fibrous membrane. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that surgical trauma is well tolerated by the ovaries and does not impair subsequent ovarian function. However, rupture of the preovulatory follicle and its release of the oocyte may be influenced by the presence of ovarian adhesions and/or surgical trauma.\r"
