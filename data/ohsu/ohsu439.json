  ".W": "We determined the incidence of acute, major complications in a population of 28,395 patients who underwent lumbar laminectomy for discogenic radiculopathy in the United States in 1980. This population was drawn from a broad cross-section of community hospitals and represented 31% of all patients who underwent laminectomy that year for this condition. Our cohort excluded patients with a) operations exceeding two disc levels, b) fusion, c) previous lumbar laminectomy, or d) coexistent discitis, spondylosis, spinal stenosis, myelopathy, or arachnoiditis. The incidence of death was 5.9 per 10,000. The causes of death were septicemia, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary emobolus. The incidence of at least one major complication was 157 per 10,000. The incidences of specific complications were as follows: infection requiring intravenously administered antibiotics, 30.7; major neurological deficit, 29.8; pulmonary embolus, 10.7; and myocardial infarction, 5.6. We studied four additional categories of complication. Patients were counted only when a second operation was required to treat the complication. The categories and incidence per 10,000 were as follows: incisional hematoma, 8.7; cerebrospinal fluid fistula, 10.5; ventral perforation, 1.6; and retention of a foreign body, 0.7. Among the patients whose hospitalizations were otherwise normal, 6.7% received a blood transfusion; of the patients whose hospitalizations were complicated, 24% required transfusion. The demographic characteristics of transfusion. The demographic characteristics of patients with a normal hospitalization were tabulated separately from those whose hospitalizations were complicated. Neurosurgeons performed 60% of the operations, and orthopedic surgeons performed 40%. The speciality of the surgeon was not a factor in determining the risk involved in surgery. Spinal anesthesia was used in 7% of the cases, and no pattern of complications emerged that was uniquely related to that technique.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 16 patients with symptoms such as pain in the neck, occiput, shoulder and arm; numbness in the hands; and/or difficulty in walking, is described. Neurological examination of the upper extremities disclosed signs of nerve roots dysfunction in 5 patients and long tract signs in 12, whereas examination of the lower extremities disclosed long tract signs in every patient. Positive contrast cervical myelograms suggested mild posterior bulging of one or two intervertebral discs in every patient, but computed tomographic myelograms invariably demonstrated a coincident narrow cervical spinal canal, thus revealing the true compressive potential of the aforementioned mild disc protrusion on the spinal cord. All patients underwent anterior cervical microdiscectomy of the offending disc or discs, which were found to be degenerated. No case of frank rupture of the anulus was identified. Response to treatment was graded as excellent in 12 patients, who had complete relief of symptoms, and good in 4 patients, who had mild residual complaints. This study suggests that incompetence (bulging) of a cervical intervertebral disc may acquire important clinical significance in the presence of a narrow spinal canal by compressing the spinal cord and the corresponding nerve roots. Surgical removal of the diseased disc may result in restoration of neurological function.\r"

This was not seen in cortical or other gray matter structures. Autoradiographic examination correlated well, demonstrating isotope within the oedematous areas of the white matter in addition to the expected concentration in the leptomeningeal layers. These findings are discussed in the context of antibody binding to tumor tissue and the possible benefits conferred in the treatment of infiltrating tumor cells.\r"

All three had past histories pointing to the existence of a cerebellar lesion for many decades prior to surgery: Patient 1 had had nystagmus on lateral gaze on the side of the tumor since early childhood; Patient 2 had had sensorineural hearing loss on the side of her neoplasm for 38 years preceding the operation; and Patient 3 was diagnosed as having a brain tumor 51 years before the operation. (He has been blind because of pressure hydrocephalus for half a century, but otherwise managed to live a productive farming and family life until he sustained a head injury in a car accident, which forced him to undergo removal of his cerebellar tumor.) The neoplasms in all three instances were found by histological examination to be low-grade astrocytomas. These cases indicate that low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas, which are well known for their characteristically long postoperative courses, may at times manifest a slow growth potential with an exceptionally long preoperative course.\r"

Since such patients have an iatrogenically induced absence of neurological function, brain death cannot be diagnosed clinically. Furthermore, as demonstrated by two of our patients, monitoring of intracranial pressure, even in the face of brain death, may show a low intracranial pressure and an intracranial pulse, suggesting the presence of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and, therefore, brain viability. Under these circumstances, however, significant intracranial blood flow may be absent. Therefore, we suggest that a patient in barbiturate coma should undergo serial blood flow studies, even when the intracranial pressure is low and an intracranial pulse is present, to determine whether brain death has occurred.\r"

One patient had received anticoagulation therapy soon after lumbar puncture and the other had a low platelet count (63,000/mm3) at the time of lumbar puncture. In both patients a hematoma evolved, producing blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow. Clinical manifestations consisted of severe back and radicular pain with sphincteric disturbances followed by rapidly developing severe paraparesis. Of the methods of radiographic evaluation that were used, including computed tomography (CT) without contrast enhancement, myelography, CT with intrathecally administered contrast medium, and magnetic resonance imaging, we found the best study to be myelography via lateral cervical puncture followed by CT. Unfortunately, diagnosis was delayed, and surgical evacuation of the hematomas did not substantially improve the patients' conditions. The salient clinical and radiographic features of this disorder and its pathophysiology are reviewed. Prompt recognition of these lesions is necessary so that surgical intervention may maximize chances of recovery.\r"

The tethering was caused by a thick filum terminale in 6 patients. On MRI scans, the conus medullaris was at L4 in 2 patients, at L2 in 3 patients, and the filum terminale appeared thick in 1 patient. The spinal cord was tethered to an intradural lipoma correctly demonstrated by MRI in 6 patients. Increased epidural fat was misdiagnosed as an intradural lipoma in one patient and a lipomatous stalk was not identified in 2 other patients. Scar tissue resulting from repair of a meningocele had tethered the cord in the remaining 8 patients. On MRI scans, the conus medullaris was located between L3 and S3; in 5 of the patients, scar tissue was apparent on the MRI scan. This correlative study supports the use of MRI as the initial, and possibly the only, imaging modality when a tethered spinal cord is suspected. Improved or more recent MRI techniques will help demonstrate these anomalies better.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with dislocation of the cervical spinal with posterior ligamentous damage were treated with posterior internal fixation using a twisted pair of 22-gauge titanium wires and iliac crest bone fusion. Fixation using the titanium wire was compared with fixation using stainless steel wire for differences in surgical insertion, long term stability of bony fusion, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) artifacts near the implanted wire. MRI of the cervical spine is valuable for diagnosing the acute and chronic consequences of traumatic cervical spinal injury by providing anatomic evaluation of both the spinal cord and the supporting bony/ligamentous structures in the neck. Because MRI is an accurate and sensitive noninvasive test, it is especially useful for the long-term serial assessment of the region near the cervical dislocation site to detect the sequelae of spinal cord injury, including syrinx, arachnoid cyst, cord tethering, and persistent mechanical impingement on the spinal cord or spinal roots. Previous attempts at our institution to obtain useful MRI scans of the cervical region adjacent to stainless steel wires after posterior wire fixation have failed due to marked imaging artifacts from the ferromagnetic properties of these wires. Our substitution of biocompatible titanium wire (Titanium 6 A1-4V ELI alloy, Specialty Steel and Forge, Leonia, New Jersey) for stainless steel wire produced identical immediate stabilization and ultimate bony fusion of the fracture and yielded minimal MRI artifacts overlying the immediately adjacent spinal cord and neural canal; however, the installation was technically more difficult, because of the titanium wire's greater stiffness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The TMBJ significantly limited flexion/extension at each level of the cervical spine, as well as rotation and lateral bending (P less than 0.001). Flexion/extension at each cervical level was found to be equal to that allowed by the halo with body jacket at most levels and less at the occiput-C1, C3-C4, and C6-C7 (as reported in studies using similar methodology). The present study suggest that the thermoplastic Minerva body jacket is a valuable option for rigid external immobilization of the cervical spine.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 526 patients who underwent neurosurgery for nontraumatic conditions over a 5-year period revealed 36 (6.8%) patients with endoscopically and or surgically documented postoperative gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Two patients had GI bleeding and perforation, and the remaining patients had bleeding only. Multivariate analysis indicated 5 factors that were of independent significance in predicting the development of postoperative GI complications. These factors included 1) inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, 2) preoperative coma (Glasgow Coma Score less than 9), 3) the presence of postoperative complications, 4) age greater than or equal to 60 years, and 5) pyogenic infection of the central nervous system. Further analysis of the 36 patients with GI complications revealed that they could be divided into three groups with different clinical courses. In Group I (n = 10), all patients died as a result of their neurological conditions; GI complications were just preterminal events and did not require treatment. In Groups II (n = 11) and III (n = 15), GI complications were symptomatic and life-threatening events, respectively. Eleven patients from Group III died as a direct result of the GI complications. Separate multivariate analyses based on the patients in Groups II and III revealed that preoperative coma was the only significant factor that predicted the occurrence of life-threatening complications. Patients who are at high risk of developing postoperative GI complications can thus be identified, and intensive prophylaxis may be instituted.\r"

  ".W": "Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to assess collateral flow and to quantitate perfusion velocity changes in a group of 18 patients requiring temporary or permanent surgical occlusion of the internal carotid artery for treatment of their cerebrovascular lesions. Velocity measurements were correlated with times of occlusion and neurological outcome in order to assess safe vessel occlusion times and the need for an intraoperative shunt. These data were used to calculate a perfusion velocity index (PVi), which indicated that values greater than 2 were well tolerated, and values of less than 1 were associated with ischemic signs. In addition, preoperative TCD examinations were combined with compressive maneuvers of the carotid artery in the neck to evaluate the feasibility of carotid clamp ligation for the treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms deemed unsuitable for direct clipping. When maintenance of neurological function and intracranial vessel flow velocities were found to be normal, with aneurysmal flow velocities of zero, ligation of the carotid artery could safely be undertaken. Finally, TCD allowed continuous surveillance of cerebral hemodynamics, which gave immediate assurance of postoperative ICA patency, as well as the ability to identify high velocity states associated with hyperperfusion syndromes, which occurred in two patients.\r"

Significant statistical correlation between tissue loss as seen on a late MRI scan and neurobehavioral deficits could not be established. Among 9 patients with no tissue loss seen on MRI, 3 exhibited substantial cognitive dysfunction and 6 had mild impairment. Three patients showed minor but corresponding tissue loss and deficits. In 3 patients with pronounced pathological indications on MRI, evidence of cognitive dysfunction was absent in 2, and 1 patient showed substantial impairment. The remaining 5 individuals displayed moderate pathological indications on MRI, with no obvious correspondence to cognitive functioning. In 7 patients, small white matter lesions, probably silent infarcts not seen on computed tomographic scan, were discovered on MRI. There was a clear relationship between arterial hypertension prior to aneurysm rupture and the extent of tissue loss seen on MRI. Absence of pathological findings on MRI scan did not exclude cognitive malfunctioning, and vice-versa.\r"

All the patients were women and ranged in age from 38 to 74 years. Ten patients sought treatment initially for ophthalmoplegia, 9 for retro-orbital pain, 8 for facial paresthesia, and 3 for loss of vision. Two patients had symptoms of transient ocular or brain ischemia. The diameter of the aneurysm was greater than 3 cm in 10 patients. Ten patients underwent gradual occlusion of the ICA by Selverstone clamp under anticoagulation and monitoring of neurological status. One patient underwent ligation of a severely stenotic ICA under general anesthesia and electroencephalographic monitoring. Four patients underwent trapping of the aneurysm (after attempts at direct obliteration) under electroencephalographic and cerebral blood flow monitoring. Two patients with incompetent circle of Willis collaterals underwent prophylactic superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery prior to ICA occlusion. There was no postoperative clinical change in 9 patients. Ophthalmoplegia improved in 2 patients, and facial pain improved in 3. Three patients developed new extraocular muscle palsies within hours of ICA occlusion; these resolved in all patients by 1 week postoperatively. No change in aneurysm size was documented by serial postoperative computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans. After a follow-up of 5 to 6 years (range, 6 months-9 years), 11 patients have remained neurologically stable. Two patients experienced delayed transient worsening of visual or facial symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used intracerebral transluminal angioplasty to treat two episodes of symptomatic vasospasm in a patient recovering from an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The procedures were performed after medical therapies, intravascular volume expansion, and induced arterial hypertension failed to alleviate the patient's neurological condition. The first angioplasty, confined to the right middle cerebral and distal internal carotid arteries, took place more than 30 hours after the onset of left hemiplegia. Despite the subsequent discovery of a small parietal lobe infarct, it brought about a marked improvement in left motor function and may have also limited the spread of necrotic damage. The second angioplasty was necessitated when stenotic segments of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries caused a 24-hour decline in the patient's mental status. Although delayed in relation to the onset of symptoms, it successfully reversed the patient's comatose state. The use of transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm is generally limited to cases where it can be performed shortly after the onset of neurological symptoms; delaying the procedure increases the risk of hemorrhage from reperfused areas of infarction. Our experience with this patient demonstrates that delayed angioplasty can improve vascular flow to ischemic territory, even after infarction, without complications and with resultant improvement in neurological function.\r"

On the basis of these cases, experimental data, and theoretical considerations, we seriously question the wisdom of using staged surgical resection of cerebral arteriovenous malformation to prevent complications related to alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. The reasons for this concern are: the repeated occurrence of acute-on-chronic hypoperfusion during staged resection; a lack of understanding of the time course for the correction of a disordered autoregulation; risk of hemorrhage between the initial and final resection; difficulty in assessing and substantiating flow reduction after subtotal resection; the rapidity of collateralization; the divergence of flow from large, readily accessible feeding arteries to deep penetrating vessels; and attenuation of the wall thickness in collateral vessels as a consequence of increased flow.\r"

We describe 8 patients originally diagnosed as having MG by knowledgeable clinicians, in whom an intracranial lesion instead of, or in addition to, MG was later identified. The lesions included parasellar tumors and aneurysms. In patients presenting with clinical features of ocular MG, it is therefore essential to establish a definite diagnosis of MG, to exclude other possible causes of \"pseudomyasthenia,\" and to exclude other diseases that might be masked by coexisting myasthenic weakness. We recommend that patients with clinical features of MG limited to the ocular or cranial musculature be thoroughly evaluated for intracranial mass lesions, using CT or MRI if warranted.\r"

The tests selected for this study measured the primary cognitive manifestations of AD across a range of severity of the disorder, and discriminated between normal subjects and those with mild and moderate dementia. The batteries also detected deterioration of language, memory, praxis, and general intellectual status in subjects returning for reassessment 1 year later. Interrater and test-retest reliabilities were substantial. Long-term observations of this cohort are in progress in an effort to validate the clinical and neuropsychological assessments and to confirm the diagnosis by postmortem examinations. Although information on validation is limited thus far, the CERAD batteries appear to fill a need for a standardized, easily administered, and reliable instrument for evaluating persons with AD in multicenter research studies as well as in clinical practice.\r"

Compression of the cervical spinal cord by enlarged nerve roots occurred in our index patient. Multilevel decompressive laminectomies relieved the myelopathy. An unrelated patient who had syncope precipitated by neck rotation had hypertrophied nerve roots that eroded into the transverse foramina in juxtaposition to the vertebral arteries. In a 3rd patient, compression of hypertrophied nerve roots within the thecal sac and neural foramina was associated with spinal claudication and radiculopathy, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Gadolinium DTPA (Gd-DTPA) is a paramagnetic blood-brain barrier contrast agent for MRI that has been used primarily in adults. During May through October 1987, 17 children between the ages of 3 and 18 years with brain tumors underwent MRI examinations, before and after Gd-DTPA (11 gliomas, 4 medulloblastomas, 1 craniopharyngioma, and 1 child with neurofibromatosis and no pathologic diagnosis). We compared T1 and T2 Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI with concurrent unenhanced MRI and enhanced CT, and then correlated this with the clinical and pathologic findings. Gd-DTPA enhanced tumors in all 7 patients with newly diagnosed tumors and enhanced tumors in 7 of 10 patients without clinical evidence of progressive disease at the time of the study. In the 7 new patients, Gd-DTPA defined tumor margins in all, and demonstrated internal tumor architecture (vessels, necrosis, and cysts) in 5. Areas believed to represent surgical scars showed varying degrees of enhancement. Leptomeningeal tumor spread, including spinal, not seen on pre-Gd-DTPA MRI or on contrast CT, was evident in 2 patients. Gd-DTPA enhancement obscured hemorrhage within the tumor (methemoglobin) in 2 patients. There were no significant side effects. These results suggest that Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI (1) is safe in children, (2) demonstrates the extent and character of tumors better than unenhanced MRI and enhanced CT, and (3) may allow for noninvasive imaging of leptomeningeal disease, including the spine, not previously demonstrated by any other noninvasive neuroimaging technique.\r"

There were no significant differences between groups initially. All 3 groups improved dramatically when levodopa was given, but group A showed significantly less disability in years 4, 5, and 6 than did group C. The groups did not differ with respect to side effects. To determine if age at onset affected mortality, we sorted records from 4 geographically diverse centers into the same 3 groups. Results on 359 patients followed for 3,314 person-years, covering a period of 17 years after onset of symptoms, showed that group A had the most favorable observed-to-expected mortality ratio, 1.82, compared with 2.17 and 2.20 for groups B and C respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. Results from the disability analyses indicate that patients with onset of Parkinson's disease under 50 years of age may have a more favorable prognosis than those whose symptoms begin in later years.\r"

At concentrations above 1.5%, the parietal N20 disappeared in 6 patients whereas the P22 was clearly identified in 12. The central conduction time increased significantly whereas the spinal conduction was not delayed by increasing levels of isoflurane. These results show that isoflurane anesthesia is a useful pharmacologic model to demonstrate the independence of the N20 recorded over the parietal scalp and the P22 recorded over the frontal scalp.\r"

To distinguish between these 2 possibilities, we assessed changes in excitation-contraction coupling by measuring twitch tension (TT) and twitch potentiation (P-TT) of the human adductor pollicis and tibialis anterior, while we analyzed metabolic changes using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Low-intensity exercise produced a much greater fall of TT and P-TT than MVC, high energy phosphates, or intracellular pH (pHi). In addition, the recovery of TT and P-TT was much slower than recovery of MVC, high energy phosphates, or pHi. These results suggest that the greater fall of TT and the delayed recovery following low-intensity exercise are caused by impaired excitation-contraction coupling.\r"

Light microscopic evaluation of the excised specimen showed that it was a gland-forming benign tumor. It originated from the surface epithelium by the downward invagination of tubular formations that underwent secondary and tertiary ramifications. The surface epithelium overlying the mass was not normal conjunctival squamous epithelium, but it was a modification in the form of a superficial layer of columnar to cuboidal cells surmounting several nuclei similar to the cells lining the subepithelial lumen-forming units. Electron microscopy showed that both the surface and tumor epithelium contained apical lacrimal-type zymogen granules and basilar whorls of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. Scattered myoepithelial cells were associated with the acinar-type epithelium of the tumor, and there were goblet cells intermixed. Neither light nor electron microscopy disclosed the presence of true ducts. The authors conclude that the lesion was a benign proliferation of lacrimal secretory-type cells and suggest the term \"dacryoadenoma\" for this previously undescribed entity.\r"

Six patients with upper eyelid tumors and variable degrees of epibulbar pagetoid extension were treated without exenteration. All underwent wide local resections of their upper eyelids (repaired by Cutler-Beard procedures), with adjunctive cryotherapy to the involved epibulbar surfaces after preoperative map biopsies of the conjunctiva had been done. Cryotherapy was applied during the second-stage Cutler-Beard procedure after initial resection of the tumor bulk. Follow-ups ranging from 12 to 50 months, with conjunctival biopsies at 6-month intervals, showed no recurrence of pagetoid tumor. Although exenteration was avoided, dry-eye symptoms, symblepharon, corneal erosion, and vascularization were side effects, which the patients were willing to tolerate to avoid radical surgery. The complications were most severe in the two patients who were either elderly or had more than two quadrants of epibulbar pagetoid disease.\r"

An acceptable result at 6 weeks was defined as a lid level within 1 mm of the desired level achieved in 74% of lids with acquired ptosis. The amount of ptosis present preoperatively was the major factor in our study; levator function and type of anesthesia did not affect the success rate. The most significant finding was a lower long-term success rate due to a drop in lid level clustered at the 2- to 4-month period postoperatively. The authors speculate on the cause for this finding.\r"

  ".W": "While Graves' disease is the most common cause of enlarged extraocular muscles, other disorders may masquerade as dysthyroid orbitopathy. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of the computed tomographic (CT) scans of 60 patients with nonthyroid enlarged extraocular muscles to establish the differential radiographic features of these disorders. The diseases were classified as primary or local invasion of neoplasm (26%), inflammatory (25%), metastatic tumor (20%), vascular (13%), infection (12%), and acromegaly (3%). The inflammatory cases demonstrated more bilateral involvement (40%) and less involvement of the tendons (47%) than previously appreciated. The relatively high incidence of these features in the inflammatory group is important because both features have been considered pathognomonic for Graves' disease. Primary and metastatic tumors produced a nodular muscle enlargement with sharp borders and frequent bone changes. Certain tumors showed a predilection for certain muscle groups. Vascular cases involved multiple unilateral muscles and usually enlarged the superior ophthalmic vein. Infectious cases usually demonstrated fusiform muscle enlargement with blurred margins, whereas acromegaly caused moderate enlargement of all recti. Although certain diagnosis-specific radiographic patterns are described, no feature is pathognomonic for any disorder.\r"

The most common aneurysm location for superior division paresis of the oculomotor nerve was the superior cerebellar-posterior cerebral artery junction, where aneurysms (3) of the basilar artery compressed and flattened the interpeduncular oculomotor nerve from below. A superior cerebellar artery aneurysm and brain stem infarction affected the intra-axial course of the oculomotor nerve producing superior division paresis. Only an aneurysm of the intracavernous carotid artery resulted in superior division paresis at the expected anatomic site of bifurcation of the oculomotor nerve into its superior and inferior divisions. Because the superior division supplies innervation exclusively to the superior rectus muscle and levator palpebrae, an aneurysm involving this branch does not affect the pupillo-constrictor fibers. Consequently, cerebral angiography should be considered in the initial evaluation of this ocular motor deficit.\r"

In a series of 200 AIDS patients evaluated clinically, AIDS retinopathy was present in 66.5%. Sixty-four percent had cotton-wool spots, and 12% had intraretinal hemorrhages. Cytomegalovirus retinitis was diagnosed in 28% of AIDS patients. Neuro-ophthalmic lesions were found in 8% of all AIDS patients and were present in 33% of those patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome retinopathy was present in 40% of 35 patients with the AIDS-related complex (ARC) and in 1.3% of 232 patients with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, evaluated photographically. These results suggest that the prevalence of AIDS retinopathy increases with increasing severity of HIV infection, and that CMV retinitis presents a significant vision-threatening problem in AIDS patients.\r"

Chemodenervation of an extraocular muscle was not as successful as traditional strabismus surgery for treatment of infantile esotropia and other comitant deviations. Botulinum A toxin injection was ineffective in patients who had restrictive strabismus. This drug has limited application in the management of patients with strabismus.\r"

Mild IOOA did revert to normal in 12 patients after only horizontal surgery.

Retinoblastomas were reliably distinguished from Coats' disease, toxocariasis, and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous on the basis of MRI findings. Calcification cannot be reliably detected on MRI scans. Lesions elevated less than 4 mm may not be detected reliably by MRI at this time. Computed tomography (CT) can detect calcification with a high degree of accuracy. Retinoblastomas appeared as moderately hyperintense masses on T1- and proton-weighted MRIs. They became hypointense in T2-weighted MRIs. This MRI characteristic is similar to that of uveal melanoma. Intraocular calcification in children especially younger than 3 years of age is highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. In the diagnosis of retinoblastoma, MRI is not as specific as CT because of its lack of sensitivity in detecting calcification. However, MRI, because of its superior contrast resolution, offers more information in the differentiation of pathologic intraocular conditions responsible for leukocoria. The authors also describe their preliminary work of in vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of eyes with retinoblastoma and an eye with uveal melanoma in an 18-year-old black woman.\r"

Histopathologically, the lesions were predominantly or exclusively subepithelial melanocytic nevi and were demonstrated not to compress the punctum or canaliculus. Infiltration of the nevus cells within the orbicularis striated muscle fibers was a common finding owing to the latter's superficial location in the eyelids. If patients request excision for cosmetic reasons, these lesions are best managed by a horizontal circular shave excision with the temporary placement of a silicon punctual plug. The differential diagnosis includes cyst, papilloma, melanoma, and basal cell carcinoma.\r"

Whether reflective of a local or distant metastasis, all of the lesions histopathologically were located in the substantia propria, and were separated from the overlying epithelium by a thin mantle of collagen. There was no evidence of atypical intraepithelial melanocytic proliferation, as would be expected in association with a primary conjunctival melanoma. Two of the cutaneous metastases exhibited a binodular or multinodular appearance that correlated histopathologically with variably confluent micronodules suggestive of the origin of the clinical lesion from a shower of tumor cell emboli. Patients with local intralymphatic spread from a primary conjunctival melanoma may experience additional lesions in the conjunctival sac or eyelid skin and are at risk for regional or distant metastases. They should be examined closely several times a year. The patients with the distant metastases all had their previously diagnosed primary cutaneous tumors on the truncal skin (a similar tendency emerges from a review of previous ocular cases), typically had myriad other cutaneous lesions, and two of them had a neoplastic iridocyclitis and vitreitis. These patients tended to die of the disseminated tumors within 1 year after conjunctival metastases developed.\r"

We therefore examined the sectional anatomy of 24 fresh human temporomandibular joints at different gradations of jaw opening, protrusion, and laterotrusion. We found that the tissues of the posterior disk attachment expanded in volume and occupied the space behind the condyle when the mouth was opened, protruded, or laterotruded to the contralateral side. Volumetric expansion of the tissue seemed to be due mainly to distension of the venous structures in the retrodiskal area. In the lateral region of the joint, tissue from the superior aspect of the parotid gland also seemed to contribute to the filling of the space posterior to the condyle. Thus, the retrodiskal tissue appears to have a substantial capacity to expand and fill the mandibular fossa when the condyle translates anteriorly. The possibility of a dynamic vascular physiology is suggested.\r"

Very little is known about the possible ill effects of these talismans because there is no report of these radiographic findings in major dental journals. In the present series of 12 cases representing a total of 65 talismans, only one talisman was surgically removed. We believe that generally no definitive treatment is required.

The third molars were removed without any significant intraoperative or postoperative bleeding. Factor XII not only has an important function in the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, but it also plays a significant role in complement activation, kinin generation, and fibrinolysis. It would seem that a deficiency in this factor would have widespread clinical implications. In fact, the only clinical significance seems to be a predisposition to thromboembolism in factor XII deficient patients.\r"

Chlorhexidine had no effects of any clinical significance on parameters such as number of days with fever, number of oral lesions, plaque score, gingival bleeding score, or occurrence of candidiasis. There was, however, an increased number of patients who had a burning sensation in the mouth, and a tendency toward increased numbers of salivary enterococci, enterobacteria, and/or Pseudomonas in patients who rinsed with chlorhexidine. The results of the present study do not support the use of chlorhexidine mouthrinses in patients who are able to maintain good oral hygiene by mechanical means during their illness.\r"

An oral examination revealed multiple red 3 to 6 mm macules scattered over the oral mucosa, involving the buccal and labial mucosa, palate, and gingiva. The favored clinical diagnosis was candidiasis. Histologically, the biopsy specimen showed severe epithelial dysplasia. Three additional oral biopsies of different sites were performed and revealed similar histology. Immunohistochemical stains for human papillomavirus were done, and two of four lesions stained positively. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intranuclear viral particles consistent with human papillomavirus. Further questioning and examination of the patient revealed that he had lesions of the penis that were clinically and histologically bowenoid papulosis. In addition, he admitted to oral-genital sex during the period of therapy for Hodgkin's disease. This is the first reported case of oral bowenoid papulosis, and it supports a viral cause for this disease process.\r"

The gingival cyst appeared as a 1 cm palatal enlargement lingual to the maxillary alveolar ridge and demonstrated a thin epithelial lining with localized plaquelike thickenings and occasional clear cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. There was no familial history of congenital deformities, and no additional abnormalities were noted. These two epithelium-lined structures show a clear topographic and morphologic relationship, and they may share a common embryologic origin. It is suggested that they derive from epithelium remaining subsequent to the union of the maxillary process and medial nasal process mesoderms.\r"

This study assessed thermal symmetry of the face and neck in 20 normal subjects with the use of frontal and lateral views, at 1.0 degree C and 0.5 degree C sensitivity, under controlled conditions. Electronic thermographic images were analyzed for thermal symmetry, by means of a grid matching technique, in 12 anatomic regions and the overall face. Results indicated that thermal symmetry for the entire face was high (70.2%). The 12 specific facial areas demonstrated varying levels of thermal symmetry. Regions of high symmetry on frontal projections included the anterior portion of the neck (82.0%), the TMJ (80.0%), the lower lip (78.6%), and the upper lip (77.3%). The temporal region (46.7%) was found to be of relatively low thermal symmetry. Regions of high symmetry on lateral projections included the nasal region (69.5%) and the inframandibular region (67.0%). The posterior neck region (44.2%) was found to be of relatively low thermal symmetry. In general, normal subjects demonstrated high levels of thermal symmetry over most regions of the face. This pilot investigation is an early step in the evaluation of electronic thermography for future use in dentistry.\r"

Tomography was the technique of choice for imaging osseous changes. Double joint space arthrotomography was useful for examining articular disk position and morphology. Diagnostic arthroscopy, through direct visualization of surface morphology, showed localized surface pathosis, such as synovitis; provided data on the location and size of disk perforations; and contributed reliably to a diagnosis of disk displacement on the basis of associated pathosis such as stretching of the posterior attachment.\r"

Two, three, or even four approaches may be equally effective in some cases. In other cases, one approach may be successful in the hands of one surgeon whereas another approach is more appropriate for a different surgeon. This article presents nine cases that do not have clear-cut solutions. In some, the consultants clearly disagreed, whereas in others there was some uniformity in treatment plans.

  ".W": "In summary, revision endoscopic surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis can be performed safely by using the middle turbinate (or portion thereof) or the anterior wall of the sphenoid as a landmark. These cases are more difficult and may be more prone to bleeding and scarring. The surgeon should be thoroughly familiar with and not hesitate to switch to conventional techniques in the event of excessive bleeding, proptosis, or a loss of landmarks. Aggressive postoperative care and follow-up, including office endoscopic \"touch-up\" procedures, may be necessary to maintain control of aggressive disease, along with continued medical management and any indicated immunotherapy.\r"

Prolonged or repeated episodes of acute sinusitis may lead to irreversible changes in the mucosa, resulting in chronic sinusitis. In hospitalized and immunocompromised patients sinusitis may be caused by unusual and resistant bacteria or fungi. Although sinusitis is often considered as merely an annoyance, complications can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therapy of acute sinusitis is often empiric and directed against the most common pathogens. Fungal infections of the sinuses often require surgery as well as amphotericin-B therapy. In hospitalized or immunocompromised patients therapy should be directed at suspected nosocomial pathogens or be based on appropriate culture material.\r"

Sixty-six percent (33 of 50) of the corresponding amniotic fluids were colonized when the vagina was colonized with Mycoplasma hominis. When the amniotic fluid contained M. hominis, 26% (9 of 34) of the neonates were colonized. Sixty percent (66 of 110) of the corresponding amniotic fluids were colonized when the vagina was colonized with Ureaplasma urealyticum. When the amniotic fluid contained U. urealyticum, 32% (22 of 69) of the neonates were colonized. No neonates were colonized with M. hominis without prior colonization of both the vagina and the amniotic fluid.

Despite significant maternal serologic response, there was essentially no neonatal response. Mothers with M. hominis in the AF were significantly more likely than those with negative cultures for M. hominis to exhibit IgG seroconversion and had significantly greater changes in IgG concentrations. Their infants, however, did not exhibit a significant seroresponse regardless of the AF and neonatal culture results. There was also a significant maternal seroresponse to U. urealyticum. However, this did not correlate with the presence of U. urealyticum in the AF. Significantly fewer neonates exhibited a seroresponse to U. urealyticum, again with no relation to culture results.\r"

In 44 (14% of all tested infants, 0.9% of live births) chlamydial antigen was present. Because the rate of asymptomatic maternal chlamydial endocervical colonization is estimated to be 26% at our institution (previous prospective study), we calculated a minimal failure rate for erythromycin ocular prophylaxis of from 7 to 19.5%. A subsequent case-control study revealed that mothers of infants with chlamydial conjunctivitis were more likely to be primiparous (P = 0.03) and experience longer duration of rupture of membranes before delivery (P = 0.046). We conclude that a substantial percentage of infants exposed to Chlamydia develop chlamydial conjunctivitis despite receiving erythromycin ocular prophylaxis.\r"

In the patients in whom viral culture was negative or not performed, 6 were serologically identified as having a coxsackievirus B3 infection. Among 22 patients identified as having a coxsackievirus B3 infection 7 had typical herpangina and the others had pharyngitis with or without a few small vesicles. Serum alpha-interferon was detected in all but 2 cases (one with proved infection and another with indefinite infection).

There were significant differences between the rates of reactions by lot for all local and systemic reactions except convulsions and hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes. For these latter reactions there were insufficient cases for analyses. P was less than 0.0001 for local reactions, fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, anorexia and screaming and 0.017 for vomiting. No single lot was associated with the highest or lowest rate of reactions for more than 3 of the 11 reactions. There was a significant positive association of endotoxin unit (EU) content and the percent of vaccine recipients who developed fever (P = 0.004). Fever increased in frequency from 20.6% of children immunized with vaccine lots that contained 2500 EU to 55.1% of children immunized with vaccine lots containing 40,000 EU. There were significant positive associations of all local reactions and pertussis vaccine potency (P = 0.0004), and percent of mouse weight gain (P less than 0.0001). There was also a positive association of percent mouse weight gain and persistent screaming (P = 0.001). However, for the majority of reactions there was no clinically meaningful associations between reaction rates and the biological properties of the vaccine studied.\r"

The subjects were 33 preterm infants of less than 30 weeks' gestation studied at 44 weeks' postmenstrual age: 11 infants with periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, 7 with periventricular leukomalacia, and 15 without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. There were no differences in mean gestational age and birth weight between the three groups. However, infants without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia had significantly less respiratory distress syndrome. At 44 weeks postmenstrual age, infants with periventricular leukomalacia had a significantly delayed myelination pattern (stage M2) in comparison with infants without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia and infants with periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (stages M3 and M4). The latter two groups had myelination stages that were similar to those of healthy term infants at 44 weeks' postmenstrual age. The results demonstrate that periventricular leukomalacia causes delayed myelination of the cerebrum, whereas periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage does not.\r"

  ".W": "There are no clear criteria for administration of blood to premature infants. In the past, indications for transfusion have included tachypnea, tachycardia, poor weight gain, apnea, bradycardia, pallor, lethargy, decreased activity, or poor feeding. Some have suggested that erythropoietin levels may also be useful in determining the need for transfusion. Data were studied from 11 premature infants with birth weights less than 1500 g collected throughout 469 hospital days. During that period the infants received a total of 37 blood transfusions. No overall relationship was found between hematocrit of 19% to 64% and heart rate, respiratory rate, or the occurrence of bradycardia; ie, these variables proved to be clinically unreliable as indicators of hematocrit. Furthermore, no predictable effect of transfusion could be identified on heart rate, respiratory rate, or on the incidence of apnea or bradycardia. It was anticipated that frequent episodes of apnea or bradycardia might increase serum erythropoietin concentration. To the contrary, more frequent bradycardia was associated with the low erythropoietin levels because those infants tended to receive transfusions for \"symptomatic\" anemia. The data are consistent with the concept that \"anemia of prematurity\" is not predictably associated with symptoms classically attributed to anemia. Possible reasons for this are that the premature infant has a different inherent response to anemia; that it is inappropriate to extrapolate symptoms of severe acute anemia to persons with mild or moderate chronic anemia; or, most likely, that other determinants of heart rate, respiratory rate, and apnea/bradycardia are of more importance than mild or moderate anemia.\r"

In a 3-year study of 140 OKA/Merck vaccine recipients, duration of immunity was assessed by two measures. The first was persistence of varicella-zoster antibody measured by modified fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen test. Thirty-six toddler vaccinees 12 to 24 months of age had sera obtained at 6 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years. Geometric mean titer +/- SD at 6 weeks was 57.7 +/- 2.9; at 1 year, it was 12.4 +/- 3.9; at 2 years, it was 9.9 +/- 3.9. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant overall decrease in antibody titer with time (F = 30.62, P less than .001). Post hoc comparisons indicated that the 6-week and 1-year titers were significantly different (P less than .001), but the difference between 1 and 2 years was not (P = .138). Clinical reinfections were also examined for 3 years after vaccination. Suspected varicella cases were confirmed by a fourfold or more increase in titer. Of 84 toddlers, 68 were exposed one or more times, and 6 became reinfected. Of 49 siblings, 45 were exposed, and one became reinfected. All 7 children had less than 70 vesicles and 6 of 7 were afebrile. No cases of zoster occurred. It is concluded that OKA/Merck varicella-zoster vaccination leads to antibody persistence for 2 years and the few reinfections that do occur are greatly attenuated.\r"

Clinical diagnosis was determined neurologically and included (1) coma, (2) apnea, manifested by inability to sustain respiration, and (3) absent brainstem reflexes. Electroencephalograms were performed in all patients; 17 patients had adequate cerebral blood flow as estimated by radionuclide imaging. The results indicate that (1) neurodiagnostic tests such as electroencephalograms and radionuclide scanning reconfirmed clinically determined brain death in only one half to two thirds of patients; (2) electrocerebral silence in the absence of barbiturates, hypothermia, or cerebral malformations during 24 hours was confirmatory of brain death if the clinical findings remained unchanged; (3) absence of radionuclide uptake associated with initial electrocerebral silence was associated with brain death; (4) term infants clinically brain dead for 2 days and preterm infants brain dead for 3 days did not survive despite electroencephalogram or cerebral blood flow status; and (5) phenobarbital levels greater than 25 micrograms/mL may suppress electroencephalographic activity in this age group. The findings suggest that determination of brain death in the newborn can be made solely by using clinical criteria. Confirmatory neurodiagnostic studies are of value because they can potentially shorten the period of observation.\r"

The largest injury rate was in football (61%) followed by girls and boys gymnastics, wrestling, and boys basketball. Five sports had no injuries--boys' tennis, golf, boys' and girls' swimming, and girls' water polo. Severity of injury was measured by number of days lost per injury. Girls' track had the greatest number of days lost per injury (320) followed by girls' basketball, girls' cross country, boys' track, and boys' wrestling. Sprains and strains accounted for 57% of all injuries. Of the injured athletes, 87 were seen by a physician and only 5 athletes required surgery. The small number of serious injuries requiring surgery suggests that a motivated and competent pediatrician can play an integral role as a team physician.\r"

  ".W": "In 415 nonsmoking asthmatic children who were seen consecutively, asthma symptoms were more severe if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker. This applied to both sexes but was more marked in boys than in girls. There were also other indications that sons were the more severely affected: the forced expiratory volume at 1 second, the forced expiratory flow rate during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, and the provocation concentration of histamine needed to result in a 20% decrease in the forced expiratory volume at 1 second were significantly decreased only in the sons, and lung function test results were significantly less in sons than in daughters of mothers who smoked. When the 415 children were stratified according to age, lung function improved significantly with increasing age in the children of nonsmokers; in children of smokers, by contrast, symptoms and lung function test results became progressively worse. As well, there was a correlation between these indications of asthma severity and the number of years the child had been exposed to the mother's smoke. It appeared that, compared with girls, boys were more sensitive to passive smoking, and that its adverse effect increased with age and with duration of exposure.\r"

We studied 90 children with moderately severe to severe but stable asthma for (1) fitness levels using bicycle ergometry, (2) measures of asthma severity, (3) clinician's impression of child (Child Global Assessment Scale), and (4) mother's rating of child's behavior (Child Behavior Checklist). Fitness values ranged from 15% to 120% of normal values for age, sex, and body surface area: 48% were abnormal (less than 2 SD below mean) and 5% were borderline (1 to 2 SD below mean). Associations between levels of fitness and medical and psychologic criteria were tested using regression analyses. Of the 11 medical variables used to define the severity of asthma, recent exacerbation of disease, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and specific airway conductance together accounted for 8.1% of the variability in the workload ratios (ie, R2 = 0.081). The importance of the psychologic factors in determining the variability in the workload ratios was tested after the importance of the medical variables had been considered: Child Global Assessment Scale accounted for a significant amount of variability, improving the R2 to 0.180 (an increase to 0.100, P = .003). These data suggest that, within the spectrum of disease presented by the patients in this study, adjustment to the disease is at least as important as severity of disease in determining fitness.\r"

A survey of physicians and parents of children with chronic illnesses was conducted to evaluate the practice and views of pediatricians and compare their assessments with those of parents. Surveys were mailed to 360 physicians and 519 families with response rates of 39% and 63%, respectively. The majority of physicians (74%) thought that the primary care physician should provide case management. When compared with parents, physicians underestimated the parental need for information about the child's diagnosis (8% vs 52%, P less than .001), treatments (3% vs 54%, P less than .01), and prognosis (30% vs 78%, P less than .01). They also overestimated parental needs for information regarding financial aid (70% vs 58%, P less than .01), vocations (78% vs 54%, P less than .01), and insurance (62% vs 51%, P less than .05). Four services ranked by need by parents in the top 10 were not ranked in the top 10 by physicians. Rural physicians noted that services were more difficult to obtain than did those in nonrural areas. The physicians surveyed made several recommendations for steps that could be implemented to facilitate their role as case managers. If primary care physicians are to be effective case managers, alterations in the current system of care will be required including continuing education related to chronic illness, information about community resources, reimbursement for the time required to perform case management, and better communication between physician and parents.\r"

Height for age, weight for age, and weight for height were compared with the US growth reference. Birth weights, infant feeding patterns, and parental heights were also evaluated in relation to growth. Most of the height for age, weight for age, and weight for height (n = 833) were within the 25th and 75th percentiles of the US growth reference. The mean height for age and weight for age, however, were slightly less than the median of the reference population. For different age groups, the mean height ranged from 0.2 to 2.1 cm and the mean weight ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 kg less than the reference median. The largest height difference was observed at 1 to 3 years of age and may be partly the result of intrinsic irregularities in the US growth reference at those ages. By 10 years of age, children from The Farm averaged 0.7 cm and 1.1 kg less than the reference median, representing only 0.1 and 0.3 SD from the reference. Thus, these children have adequate attained growth, even though it was modestly less than that of the reference population.\r"

Prothrombin time values obtained 48 hours after ingestion were more likely to be prolonged (6/34, 17.6%) than values obtained 24 hours after ingestion (2/104, 1.9%) (P less than .005). The occurrence of an abnormal prothrombin time could not be predicted based on the history of amount ingested or on the presence of the characteristic green-blue product dye in or around the child's mouth. Acute toxicity was evidenced by transient abdominal pain, vomiting, and heme positive stools in 2 patients. The duration of prothrombin time prolongation could not be determined because of the few values obtained after 48 hours. To detect all possible abnormal prothrombin time values, 24- and 48-hour determinations are recommended after a child has ingested a superwarfarin.\r"

All of the patients underwent renal biopsy prior to treatment; 5 of the 12 showed mesangial proliferation; and in 10 of the 12, IgM deposits were seen within the mesangium of the glomerulus. Growth rates before treatment with the alkylating agent were 4.3 +/- 1.3 cm/y increasing to 8.7 +/- 2.5 cm/y (P less than .001) after therapy despite the relapses that occurred in 5 of the patients in the year following treatment. Short-term side effects of the treatment were minimal. The significant increase in growth associated with diminished use of steroids makes the use of alkylating agents reasonable for children with nephrosis who show signs of decreased growth velocity.\r"

  ".U": "89366498\r", 
  ".W": "In the first 3 months of life, crying and fussing in normal infants tend to increase until 6 weeks of age and decrease progressively thereafter. To determine whether feeding choice and early infant temperament are predictors of early crying, 374 healthy, full-term infants were observed prospectively from birth to 6 weeks of age. Feeding choice and sociodemographic characteristics were ascertained in the first few days postpartum. Parents completed a 17-item early infant temperament questionnaire at 2 weeks of age and a 24-hour behavior diary for 8 days at 6 weeks of age. Initially breast-fed infants cried and fussed more frequently throughout 24 hours compared with those who were formula fed, and increased frequency and duration of crying and fussing were predicted by \"more difficult\" temperament. Furthermore, a different pattern of crying and fussing within the day was found for infants who were changed from breast- to formula feeding. However, according to stepwise multiple regression models, daily duration of crying/fussing was significantly predicted only by the temperament score (but not initial feeding choice), which accounted for 7% of the variance. Frequency of crying/fussing were predicted only by socioeconomic status, temperament, and feeding frequency, which accounted for 12% of the variance. Breast- or formula feeding at 6 weeks of age was independently associated with crying/fussing only during the evening. It was concluded that early infant temperament predisposes to early crying and fussing but is of limited use as a clinical predictor. Later crying/fussing behavior is not predicted by initial feeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 32 children ascertained in a 6-month interval, the records of mothers of 19 (59.4%) were diagnostic or highly suggestive of current or previous victimization. Although the prevalence of documented violence against the mothers of children in the comparison group was an unexpectedly high 16%, the case-control difference was highly significant (P less than .001). Although differences were found in the (younger) ages and (higher) parity of mothers of abused children, these differences did not predict risk of mothers' exposures to violence in a multivariate analysis. The rate of violence against single mothers of child abuse victims, however, was four times the rate against mothers who were married (P = .022). These findings suggest a need to broaden the diagnostic conceptualization of child abuse to include maternal victimization and argue for including data concerning maternal risk in formulating diagnoses and disposition plans for abused children.\r"

The type of environment in which the teaching occurs and the strategies utilized in patient education facilitate the information exchange. The nurse and client must develop trusting relationships built on effective communication skills by both client and nurse.

The most sweeping change that has come with the advent of prospective pricing for the acute care setting is in the financing of health care for the aged and disabled. Prospective pricing, which uses the diagnosis-related group system, is the method chosen by federal agencies to restrain Medicare costs. For almost two decades, the hospital has been the reservoir for the impaired elderly who could not be returned home or to the community without support services. The system now encourages shortened hospital stays. Continuing care planning is the key to balancing the care of the elder through the process of discharge planning. We must assure patients and families that their needs will be met in the community when the patient is discharged. Balancing care of elders between health care settings through discharge planning is identified in three simple words: A Complex Process. As health care professionals, we must be ready to accept this challenge.\r"

  ".W": "Nursing has become more aware of the importance of community-based health care for elders. Community supports assist older adults to maintain or improve their health, care for themselves, and continue living at home as long as possible. A variety of community services are needed by older people to achieve these purposes. Many of the services provide support for health promotion and self-care activities. These are activities in which people engage to enhance their well-being and increase their personal fulfillment and self-actualization. Health promotion program topics include exercise, nutrition, stress reduction, and physical and mental health. Self-care is the method by which people implement the lifestyle changes necessary to promote their health. As the move toward health promotion and self-care activities grows, nurses need to be alert to the issues that impact the development of community-based programs. These issues include the utilization of community health services by older adults, the allocation of health care resources to wellness-oriented as well as illness-oriented services, and reimbursement for both health promotion and nursing services. Future directions in community care for elders will include a continuing concern for cost containment. Research therefore will be needed to demonstrate the potential for cost effectiveness of health promotion and self-care activities. Interdisciplinary health care teams working with elders in the community may be the most effective means to support the quality of life that we all desire for our later years.\r"

Cognitive ability (eg, verbal fluency, maintaining attention, achieving goals) may also be diminished. Neurologic signs may include abnormal reflexes, increased or decreased motor behavior, and loss of ability to complete purposeful movement. If the damage is caused by trauma, treatment begins with care of the acute injury. Any resulting seizures should be treated with an anticonvulsant and the patient observed carefully for side effects. Another agent (eg, a stimulant, antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressant) may be needed as well, depending on the individual patient, to restore as much psychological function as possible. Counseling of both the patient and the family is important to help them avoid some difficulties and frustrations that may accompany the change in personality.\r"

Sequence analysis of DNA fragments from the B6a clone demonstrated a high degree of sequence similarity at the amino acid level with regions corresponding to portions of the heme and FAD/NADH-binding domains of tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana nitrate reductases and human NADH cytochrome b5 reductase. The identity of the cloned gene as nitrate reductase was confirmed by its ability to complement a nit-1 mutation upon transformation. The nitrate reductase gene produced a 3.4-kilobase transcript in cells derepressed with nitrate; the transcript was undetectable in cells grown in the presence of ammonium. In cells that contain a mutation in the putative regulatory gene nit-2, significantly lower levels of the 3.4-kilobase transcript were found, indicating that the wild-type nit-2 gene is involved in the control of nitrate reductase transcript levels.\r"

In experiments with L929 mouse fibroblast and Krebs 2 ascites carcinoma cells, it was found that cellular uptake of oligodeoxynucleotide derivatives is achieved by an endocytosis mechanism. Uptake is considerably more efficient at low oligomer concentration (less than 1 microM), because at this concentration a significant percentage of the total oligomer pool is absorbed on the cell surface and internalized by a more efficient absorptive endocytosis process. Two modified proteins were detected in mouse fibroblasts that were treated with the alkylating oligonucleotide derivatives. The binding of the oligomers to the proteins is inhibited by other oligodeoxynucleotides, single- and double-stranded DNA, and RNA. The polyanions heparin and chondroitin sulfates A and B do not inhibit binding. These observations suggest the involvement of specific receptor proteins in binding of oligomers to mammalian cells.\r"

As others have reported, we find that DNA replication facilitates nucleosome assembly. We show here that replication-dependent nucleosome assembly occurs in at least two steps. The first step requires replicating DNA; the second step occurs after replication has been completed and is promoted by a nuclear extract. Consistent with this multistep model, we observe that the replicated simian virus 40 minichromosome is organized into a repeating array of DNA-protein particles that are structurally distinct from mature nucleosomes. These particles may be precursors in a pathway of nucleosome assembly since in the second, replication-independent step the nuclear extract converts this nascent chromatin into nucleosomes.\r"

  ".U": "89367269\r", 
  ".W": "Following the criticism by Chock and Gutfreund [Chock, P.B. & Gutfreund, H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 8870-8874], that our proposal of direct transfer of NADH between glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-GDH; EC 1.1.1.8) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) was based on a misinterpretation of the kinetic data, we have reinvestigated the transfer mechanism between this enzyme pair. By using the \"enzyme buffering\" steady-state kinetic technique [Srivastava, D.K. & Bernhard, S.A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4538-4545], we examined the mechanism (random diffusion vs. direct transfer) of transfer of NADH between rabbit muscle alpha-GDH and pig heart LDH. The steady-state data reveal that the LDH-NADH complex and the alpha-GDH-NADH complex can serve as substrate for the alpha-GDH-catalyzed reaction and the LDH-catalyzed reaction, respectively. This is consistent with the direct-transfer mechanism and inconsistent with a mechanism in which free NADH is the only competent substrate for either enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The discrepancy between this conclusion and that of Chock and Gutfreund comes from (i) their incorrect measurement of the Km for NADH in the alpha-GDH-catalyzed reaction, (ii) inadequate design and range of the steady-state kinetic experiments, and (iii) their qualitative assessment of the prediction of the direct-transfer mechanism. Our transient kinetic measurements for the transfer of NADH from alpha-GDH to LDH and from LDH to alpha-GDH show that both are slower than predicted on the basis of free equilibration of NADH through the aqueous environment. The decrease in the rate of equilibration of NADH between alpha-GDH and LDH provides no support for the random-diffusion mechanism; rather, it suggests a direct interaction between enzymes that modulates the transfer rate of NADH. Thus, contrary to Chock and Gutfreund's conclusion, all our experimental data compel us to propose, once again, that NADH is transferred directly between the sites of alpha-GDH and LDH.\r"

The duplicated unit shows high sequence homology to the proposed energy-coupling subunit of bacterial periplasmic transport proteins. We have cloned and characterized the mouse mdr1 gene and have analyzed the genomic organization of the two homologous halves forming the mdr1 protein. The gene spans 68 kilobases, is split into 28 exons, and the two homologous halves are encoded by 14 and 13 exons. The transcriptional initiation site of the gene has been mapped and putative TATA and consensus CAAT sequences have been found at positions -27 and -83, respectively. Discrete structural domains of the mdr1 protein are encoded by separate exons: Ten of the 12 putative transmembrane domains are encoded by individual exons and the two nucleotide-binding sites are each encoded by three exons. The exon/intron organization of the gene is conserved in the two highly homologous regions encoding the nucleotide-binding sites. The conservation of certain pairs of introns, together with the high degree of sequence homology, indicate that the mouse mdr1 gene originated from the duplication of an intron-containing ancestral gene.\r"

Characterization of the activities of these two viral promoters in a number of Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines has revealed exclusive usage of only one of these promoters in all cell lines examined. Transfection of reporter constructs containing Wp and/or Cp linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene into several different Epstein-Barr virus-infected cell lines generally supports a model in which the mutually exclusive use of Cp or Wp is determined by cellular factors and not by viral strain variation.\r"

Base substitutions within the consensus half of the operator affect binding more than base substitutions within the nonconsensus half of the operator. Furthermore, changing the nonconsensus base pairs to the consensus base pairs does not increase, but decreases, binding. Evidently, the two subunits of the lambda repressor dimer bind to the two halves of the operator differently. This is consistent with the recently determined crystal structure of the complex, which shows that the relative positioning of the amino acids to the DNA bases are slightly different in the two halves of the operator. The sequence-specific interactions indicated by the systematic base-substitution experiments correlate well with the locations of the specific contacts found in the complex. Thus, the amino acids of lambda repressor, mainly of alpha 3-helix and the N-terminus arm, seem to directly read-out the DNA sequence by forming specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts to the DNA bases. The observed asymmetric recognition suggests that no recognition code governs amino acids and DNA bases in protein-DNA interactions.\r"

Here we have used in vivo psoralen cross-linking to identify the region of pre-rRNA interacting with U3 RNA. Quantitative hybridization selection/depletion experiments with clones of rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) and cross-linked nuclear RNA showed that all of the cross-linked U3 RNA was associated with a region that includes the external transcribed spacer (ETS) at the 5' end of the human rRNA precursor. To further identify the site of interaction within the approximately 3.7-kilobase ETS, Southern blots of rDNA clones were sandwich-hybridized with cross-linked RNA and then probed for cross-linked U3 RNA. These experiments showed that U3 RNA was cross-linked to a 258-base sequence between nucleotides +438 and +695, just downstream of the ETS early cleavage site (+414). The localization of U3 to this region of the rRNA precursor was not expected from previous models for a base-paired U3-rRNA interaction and suggests that U3 plays a role in the initial pre-rRNA processing event.\r"

We have recently identified and isolated, from the purple photoautotrophic bacterium, Ectothiorhodospira halophila, a 13,000-dalton photoactive yellow protein (PYP) that has a photocycle with kinetics similar to sensory rhodopsin and a very high quantum efficiency. To study the structural chemistry of protein photoreception, we determined, refined, and analyzed the crystallographic structure of PYP at 2.4 A resolution and report here that it is composed of two perpendicular antiparallel beta-sheets that enclose the chromophore. Each of the 10 beta-strands of PYP is connected directly to its nearest neighbor with +1 topology. Globally, an asymmetric distribution of side chains places aromatic and acidic side chains in an ellipsoidal band around the chromophore with a cluster of basic side chains on one side. Locally, the electron density maps place an internal lysine and the chromophore in an apparent Schiff base linkage stabilized by a buried glutamate and a tyrosine side chain. To our knowledge, the atomic resolution structure of a protein with a reversible photoisomerization has not been reported previously. Furthermore, PYP may also represent a class of proteins that bind conjugated molecules and interact with a secondary receptor system.\r"

The second region, located at -160, binds the erythroid-specific factor NF-E2 and the ubiquitous factor AP1. Using UV cross-linking, we show that NF-E2 has a higher molecular weight than AP1, demonstrating that NF-E2 is not an erythroid-specific degradation product of AP1. By point mutagenesis of the NF-E2/AP1 binding site, we define mutations that abolish binding of either NF-E2 alone or AP1 and NF-E2 together. Regulation of transcription of the PBGD erythroid promoter is abolished by those mutations, suggesting that NF-E2 but not AP1 is necessary for correct regulation of this promoter in erythroid cells.\r"

In the most favorable case, with a 20-mer cholesteryl-phosphorothioate derivative, complete inhibition by all assays was obtained with an oligomer concentration of 0.2 microM. Even decamers were active, and some antiviral activity was observed for a heptanucleotide cholesteryl-phosphorothioate derivative, which binds very poorly to complementary oligonucleotides.

However, only limited information is available regarding the properties of the enzyme. This paper reports the cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA for Vargula luciferase and the expression of the cDNA in a mammalian cell system. The primary structure, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 555 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 62,171. Two regions of the enzyme show significant amino acid sequence homology with an N-terminal segment of the photoprotein aequorin.

  ".W": "A high-affinity iodinated agonist radioligand for the A2 adenosine receptor has been synthesized to facilitate studies of the A2 adenosine receptor binding subunit. The radioligand 125I-labeled PAPA-APEC (125I-labeled 2-[4-(2-[2-[(4- aminophenyl)methylcarbonylamino]ethylaminocarbonyl]- ethyl)phenyl]ethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) was synthesized and found to bind to the A2 adenosine receptor in bovine striatal membranes with high affinity (Kd = 1.5 nM) and A2 receptor selectivity. Competitive binding studies reveal the appropriate A2 receptor pharmacologic potency order with 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) greater than (-)-N6-[(R)-1-methyl- 2-phenylethyl]adenosine (R-PIA) greater than (+)-N6-[(S)-1-methyl-2- phenylethyl]adenosine (S-PIA). Adenylate cyclase assays, in human platelet membranes, demonstrate a dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP production. PAPA-APEC (1 microM) produces a 43% increase in cAMP production, which is essentially the same degree of increase produced by 5'-N- ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (the prototypic A2 receptor agonist). These findings combined with the observed guanine nucleotide-mediated decrease in binding suggest that PAPA-APEC is a full A2 agonist. The A2 receptor binding subunit was identified by photoaffinity-crosslinking studies using 125I-labeled PAPA-APEC and the heterobifunctional crosslinking agent N-succinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (SANPAH). After covalent incorporation, a single specifically radiolabeled protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa was observed on NaDodSO4/PAGE/autoradiography. Incorporation of 125I-labeled PAPA-APEC into this polypeptide is blocked by agonists and antagonists with the expected potency for A2 receptors (see above) and is decreased in the presence of 10(-4) M guanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate. Photoaffinity crosslinking of the A1 adenosine receptor binding subunit with 125I-labeled 8-[4-[2-(4- aminophenylacetylamino)ethyl]carbonylmethyloxyphenyl]-1,3-di propylxanthine (PAPAXAC) (an A1 selective photoaffinity probe) in the same tissue reveals a 38-kDa peptide that exhibits the appropriate A1 receptor pharmacology. 125I-labeled PAPA-APEC, therefore, has identified the A2 receptor binding subunit as a 45-kDa protein that is unique and distinct from the A1 binding subunit.\r"

Application of an analytical method that examines the difference between solvent-accessible surface areas in packed and partially unpacked bundles reduced the number of structures to 16. Angular requirements further reduced the list of bundles to 13. In 12 of these bundles, all pairs of neighboring helices were oriented in an anti-parallel fashion.

The inhibition of DNA synthesis by nigericin occurs without any significant decrease in the ATP concentration and in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The DNA synthesis inhibition is caused neither by a decrease in the intracellular [K+] nor by an increase in the intracellular [Na+] accompanying the nigericin effect (at least at low concentrations of the antibiotic). Nigericin should thus be regarded as a type of a cytostatic primarily affecting intracellular pH.\r"

The primary sequences of the four polypeptide chains making up the acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica contain many possible sites for glycosylation or phosphorylation. We have used liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry to identify posttranslationally modified residues and to determine the intact oligosaccharide structures of the carbohydrate present on the acetylcholine receptor. Asparagine-143 of the alpha subunit (in consensus numbering) is shown to be glycosylated with high-mannose oligosaccharide. Asparagine-453 of the gamma subunit is not glycosylated, a fact that bears on the question of the orientations of putative transmembranous helices M3, MA, and M4. The structures of the six major acetylcholine receptor oligosaccharides are determined: the major components (70%) are of the high-mannose type, with bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides making up approximately equal to 22 mol% of the total carbohydrate. This application of a multichannel array detector mass spectrometer provided a breakthrough in sensitivity that allowed us to identify the site of attachment of, and the sequence of, oligosaccharides on a 300-kDa membrane protein from only 5 pmol of the isolated oligosaccharide.\r"

We have analyzed the genetic interactions required for fla gene expression by determining the effect of mutations in 30 known fla genes on transcription from four operons in the hook gene cluster. These results show that the flaO (transcription unit III) and flbF (transcription unit IV) operons are located at or near the top of the hierarchy. They also reveal an extensive network of negative transcriptional controls that are superimposed on the positive regulatory cascade described previously. The strong negative autoregulation observed for the flaN (transcription unit I), flbG (transcription unit II), and flaO (transcription unit III) promoters provides one possible mechanism for turning off fla gene expression at the end of the respective synthetic periods. We suggest that these positive and negative transcriptional interactions are components of genetic switches that determine the sequence in which fla genes are turned on and off in the C. crescentus cell cycle.\r"

These genes are controlled in a positive trans-acting hierarchy that reflects the order of assembly of the flagellum. Using plasmids carrying transcriptional fusions of either a neo or a lux reporter gene to the promoters of three flagellar genes representing different ranks in the hierarchy (the hook operon, a basal body gene flbN, and the flaO gene), we have measured the level of chimeric gene expression in 13 flagellar mutant backgrounds. Mutants in the hook operon or in basal body genes caused overproduction of both hook operon and basal body gene chimeric mRNAs, suggesting that negative regulation is superimposed on the positive trans-acting control for these early events in the flagellar hierarchy. Mutants in the structural genes and in genes involved in flagellar assembly had no effect on flaO expression, placing the flaO gene near the top of the hierarchy. However, flaO expression appears to be under negative control by two regulatory genes flaS and flaW. Negative control, as a response to the completion of specific steps in the assembly process, may be an important mechanism used by the cell to turn off flagellar gene expression once the gene product is no longer needed.\r"

Twenty-six karyotypes are present among 42 animals. Observations of the natural population over a 7-year period and breeding experiments with captive animals indicate that heterozygous individuals suffer no detectable reduction in fitness.

We also demonstrate the application of this technique to identify the chromosomal locations of large fragments of the human X chromosome cloned in a yeast artificial chromosome and the general applicability of the method to the preparation of DNA probes from cloned human sequences. The technique allows rapid gene mapping and provides a simple method for the isolation and analysis of specific chromosomal regions.\r"

A unique intron probe isolated from the larger PCR product is used for the detection of intron-containing clones from recombinant DNA libraries that also contain pseudogene clones. This method has been used successfully for the selective isolation of an intron-containing rat L19 ribosomal protein gene in the presence of multiple pseudogenes. Analysis of a number of mammalian ribosomal protein multigene families by PCR indicates that they all contain only a single gene with introns.\r"

By utilizing the long-term marrow culture system, freshly isolated bone marrow cells were subjected to multiple infection cycles with cell-free supernatants containing high titers of viral vector and then maintained in long-term marrow culture in the absence of any overt selection pressure. By using this experimental protocol, about 30-40% of the hematopoietic progenitors were productively transduced with the viral vector, as judged by the appearance of G418-resistant colonies derived from granulocyte/macrophage and multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. The vector-encoded human ADA gene was expressed efficiently in both the myeloid and lymphoid progeny of the cultured bone marrow cells, reaching levels between 15% and 100% as compared to the levels of ADA in normal bone marrow cells. The efficiency of gene transfer and ADA production was proportional to the number of infection cycles. Furthermore, transduction of the ADA vectors into the bone marrow cells derived from an ADA-deficient patient restored the capacity of the cells to respond to phytohemagglutinin and interleukin 2.\r"

Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines based on adenovirus vectors have been developed to address global needs for effective control of hepatitis B infection. Although considerable progress has been made in the construction of recombinant adenoviruses that express large amounts of HBV gene products, preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy testing of candidate vaccines has remained difficult due to the lack of a suitable animal model. We demonstrate here that chimpanzees are susceptible to enteric infection by human adenoviruses type 7 (Ad7) and type 4 (Ad4) following oral administration of live virus. Moreover, after sequential oral immunization with Ad7- and Ad4-vectored vaccines containing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene, significant antibody responses to HBsAg (anti-HBs) were induced in two chimpanzees. After challenge with heterologous HBV, one chimpanzee was protected from acute hepatitis and the other chimpanzee experienced modified HBV-induced disease. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using orally administered recombinant adenoviruses as a general approach to vaccination.\r"

We show here that deletion of this sequence renders the envelope unable to elicit neutralizing antibodies. In addition, using synthetic peptide fragments of RP135, we have mapped the neutralizing determinant to 8 amino acids and found that a peptide of this size elicits neutralizing antibodies. This sequence contains a central Gly-Pro-Gly that is generally conserved between different HIV-1 isolates and is flanked by amino acids that differ from isolate to isolate. Antibodies elicited by peptides from one isolate do not neutralize two different isolates, and a hybrid peptide, consisting of amino acid sequences from two isolates, elicits neutralizing antibodies to both isolates. By using a mixture of peptides of this domain or a mixture of such hybrid peptides the type-specificity of the neutralizing antibody response to this determinant can perhaps be overcome.\r"

GPIX is a relatively small (Mr, 17,000) protein that may provide for membrane insertion and orientation of the larger component of the complex, GPIb (Mr, 165,000). Using antibody screening, we cloned a cDNA encoding GPIX from a human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library constructed in phage lambda gt11. Lacking a 5' untranslated region and start codon, the cDNA sequence includes 604 nucleotides, beginning with 495 bases at the 5' end coding for 165 amino acids, followed by a stop codon and 106 noncoding bases at the 3' end. By Northern blot analysis, the GPIX cDNA hybridizes with a single 1.0-kilobase species of platelet poly(A)+ RNA. Translation of the cDNA sequence gives a predicted protein sequence beginning with a truncated putative signal sequence of 5 amino acid followed by a sequence of 17 amino acids matching that determined directly by Edman degradation of intact GPIX. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature GPIX includes an NH2-terminal extracytoplasmic domain of 134 residues, a transmembrane domain of 20 residues, 6 intracytoplasmic residues, and 1 N-linked glycosylation site. GPIX contains a leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) sequence of 24 amino acids similar to conserved LRG sequences in GPIb and other proteins from humans, Drosophila, and yeast. \"Flanking\" sequences of approximately 22 amino acids are present at the NH2 and/or COOH sides of the \"central\" LRG sequence(s) in GPIX, GPIb, and the other human and Drosophila members of the LRG family.

Removal of the tumor eliminated most of the big IGF-II from the sera of two patients. Because specific IGF-binding proteins modify the bioactivity of IGFs, the sizes of the endogenous IGF-binding protein complexes were determined after neutral gel filtration through Saphadex G-200. Normally about 75% of IGFs are carried as a ternary complex of 150 kDa consisting of IGF, a growth hormone (GH)-dependent IGF-binding protein, and an acid-labile complexing component. The three patients with NICTH completely lacked the 150-kDa complex. IGF-II was present as a 60-kDa complex with variable contributions of smaller complexes. In the immediate postoperative period, a 110-kDa complex appeared rather than the expected 150-kDa complex. Abnormal IGF-II binding may be important in NICTH because the 150-kDa complexes cross the capillary membrane poorly. The smaller complexes present in our patients' sera would be expected to enter interstitial fluid readily, and a 4- to 5-fold increase in the fraction of IGFs reaching the target cells would result.\r"

Progesterone, in estrogen-primed rats, caused the induced oxytocin receptors to spread over the area containing the oxytocin fibers. Infusion of oxytocin into the ventromedial hypothalamus increased the display of lordosis behavior only in females primed with both estradiol benzoate and progesterone.

  ".W": "In a variety of mammalian neurons, a brief depolarization generates an afterdepolarizing potential that triggers the firing of a short series or burst of action potentials. Although such burst firing is thought to contribute to the processing of neural information, the ionic currents that underlie this phenomenon have not been established. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on dorsal root ganglion neurons, we have found that the current that underlies this type of burst firing is a transient low-threshold (T-type) Ca2+ current. The data suggest that the T-type Ca2+ current may play an important role in the processing of information in the nervous system by virtue of its ability to elicit burst firing in neurons.\r"

  ".U": "89367338\r", 
  ".W": "During neonatal development glucocorticoids potentiate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis by regulating the expression of myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (sn-glycerol-3-phosphate: NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8). The actual locus at which hydrocortisone exerts its developmental influence on glial physiology is, however, not well understood. Glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is glucocorticoid-inducible in oligodendrocytes at all stages of development both in vivo and in vitro. In newborn rat cerebral cultures, between 9 and 15 days in vitro, a 2- to 3-fold increase in myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein mRNA levels occurs in oligodendrocytes within 12 hr of hydrocortisone treatment. Immunostaining demonstrates that this increase in mRNAs is followed by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the protein levels within 24 hr. In vitro transcription assays performed with oligodendrocyte nuclei show an 11-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in response to hydrocortisone but no increase in transcription of myelin basic protein or proteolipid protein. These results indicate that during early myelinogenesis, glucocorticoids influence the expression of key oligodendroglial markers by different processes: The expression of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas the expression of myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein is modulated via a different, yet uncharacterized, mechanism involving post-transcriptional regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals contain a circadian clock that synchronizes behavioral and physiological rhythms to the daily cycle of light and darkness. We have been probing the biochemical substrates of this endogenous pacemaker by examining the ability of treatments affecting cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to induce changes in the phase of oscillation in electrical activity of rat SCN isolated in brain slices. Our previous work has shown that daytime treatments that stimulate cAMP-dependent pathways induce phase shifts of the SCN pacemaker in vitro but treatments during the subjective night are without effect. In this study we report that the phase of SCN oscillation is reset by treatments that stimulate cGMP-dependent pathways, but only during the subjective night. Thus, the nocturnal period of SCN sensitivity to cGMP is in antiphase to the diurnal period of sensitivity to cAMP. These results suggest that cAMP and cGMP affect the SCN pacemaker through separate biochemical pathways intrinsic to the SCN. These studies provide evidence that changing biochemical substrates within the SCN circadian clock may underlie some aspects of differential temporal sensitivity of mammals to resetting stimuli.\r"

Both the rate and extent of 45Ca2+ uptake into vesicles containing reconstituted calcium channels were increased severalfold after incubation with ATP and PK-A. The degree of stimulation of 45Ca2+ uptake was linearly proportional to the extent of phosphorylation of the alpha 1 and beta subunits of the calcium channel up to a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of phosphate incorporated into each subunit. The calcium channels activated by phosphorylation were determined to be incorporated into the reconstituted vesicles in the inside-out orientation and were completely inhibited by low concentrations of dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Mg2+. The results demonstrate a direct relationship between PK-A-catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha 1 and beta subunits of the purified calcium channel and activation of the ion conductance activity of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels.\r"

It activated with a delay, reached a peak value, and then inactivated with a time constant of approximately 1.5 s. Inactivation was complete or almost so. Recovery from inactivation, at -70 mV, had a time constant of roughly 1 s. The conductance could be blocked, at least partly, by 4 mM 4-aminopyridine. The second type of conductance (present in all cells) activated at membrane potentials more negative than -40 to -80 mV and reached full activation at -130 mV. Activation potential and maximal conductance were dependent on the extracellular K+ concentration. Inactivation of the conductance first became apparent at membrane potentials more negative than -100 mV and was a two-exponential process. The conductance could be blocked by external 5 mM Cs+ ions. The third type of conductance (present in all cells) activated at membrane potentials more positive than +30 mV. Generally, the conductance did not inactivate.\r"

Evaluations for function, active range of motion, and integrated EMG activity were undertaken five times before treatment (baseline measurements), after each series of 10 treatments, and at follow-up intervals for one year. Data from these evaluations were compared with those obtained over an identical time course from 14 chronic stroke and head-injured patients undergoing a motor copy procedure (MC Group) in which the patients matched EMG output viewed on a screen from homologous upper extremity muscles. Both groups showed appropriate significant changes among many independent variables. Changes within the TT Group, however, appeared more treatment-related, whereas changes among the MC Group were latent, occurring more frequently at follow-up evaluations. There were no substantial correlations between EMG activity, active ROM, or function, thus highlighting the continuing difficulty of identifying a causative relationship between physiologic change and enhanced motor capabilities among patients with neurologic disorders. Nonetheless, the results do suggest that both techniques are of clinical benefit, with the motor copy technique offering potential cost-effectiveness because patients can self-train.\r"

Subjects were grouped and analyzed according to the following age ranges: 1) 60 to 64 years, 2) 65 to 69 years, 3) 70 to 74 years, 4) 75 to 79 years, and 5) 80 to 86 years. The best time of three trials was used for data analysis. The maximum balance time for the sharpened Romberg test was 60 seconds. For the one-legged stance test, a maximum balance time was 30 seconds. No significant difference was found between right and left or dominant and nondominant limbs while performing the one-legged stance test. No significant difference was found in mean balance time between subjects who had fallen versus those who had not fallen, nor between shoes-on and shoes-off test performance. Subjects' performance on the eyes-open test was consistently superior to their eyes-closed test performance (p less than .0001). The one-legged stance test mean balance time decreased significantly as age increased. More subjects reached the maximum balance time on the sharpened Romberg test than on the one-legged stance test. The results of this study indicate that additional research is needed in the area of balance maintenance among the elderly population.\r"

Prior to and following three breathing technique training sessions, two blood pressure measurements were made by amplified auscultation during 10 isometric contractions of the quadriceps femoris muscle with the leg positioned at 65 degrees of knee flexion. Breathing patterns were recorded on an impedance pneumograph. Data were submitted to a 2 X 2 X 3 (time X trial X group) multivariate analysis of covariance using resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures as covariates. A significant (p less than .05) time-x-group interaction revealed posttraining blood pressure response to isometric exercise had significantly decreased in the NO-VAL Group (163/120 vs 148/112 mm Hg), and had not significantly changed in the CONT Group (157/117 vs 153/117 mm Hg). These data illustrate that training to avoid the Valsalva maneuver may help attenuate the pressor response observed during isometric contractions and provide a means for safer patient exercise.\r"

The device is an L-shaped thermoplastic jig with a metric tape measure embedded in it. A sliding beak-like marker, which can be anchored with a thumbscrew, is used to identify landmarks and to measure the amount of subluxation. Eight male and two female hemiplegic subjects, 40 to 80 years old, consented to be measured for subluxation. Three standardized subluxation measurements were taken by one investigator to determine the reliability with a single rater. One measurement was taken by a second investigator and compared with the first measurement obtained by the first investigator to determine the reliability using more than one rater. Both investigators were experienced physical therapists. Each measurement was read by the other investigator, who disassembled the jig and cleaned the marks from the patient between measurements. For both analyses, an analysis of variance for repeated measurements reflected no differences between measurements attributable to raters. The unbiased intraclass correlation coefficient for a single measurement by a single rater was .89 (p less than .01) and for more than one rater was .74 (p less than .01). The standard error of measurement was +/- 0.77 mm for a single rater and +/- 1.20 mm for more than one rater. We recommend the jig as a tool to measure shoulder subluxation in patients.\r"

Subjects were 25 rehabilitation inpatients. The two investigators each measured the patients' SLRROM twice on both the paretic and nonparetic sides using a gravity goniometer. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that SLRROM was significantly less on the paretic side than on the nonparetic side (F = 28.98, p less than .001). The ANOVA demonstrated no difference in the two raters' measurements of SLRROM. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[3,1]) and interrater reliability coefficients were all good to high (.874-.989). The SLRROM on the paretic side correlated significantly with time since onset of stroke (r = -.538, p less than .01). As a consequence of this study, we concluded that 1) patients with stroke tend to lose SLRROM on the paretic side, 2) SLRROM tends to decrease with time, and 3) measurements of SLRROM obtained with a gravity goniometer are reliable and sensitive.\r"

These films reveal the probable mechanism of injury and suggest a rationale for emergent reduction. Radiographs, along with the clinical impression, suggest the likelihood of associated soft tissue injury, possibly requiring further specific radiographic studies. Significant vascular injury most often accompanies disruption of the posterior pelvic ring. Bladder and urethral trauma may be suspected in any displaced type III pelvic fracture with suggestive clinical signs. Ideally, urethrography precedes bladder catheterization. Acetabular fractures must be recognized because of their implications for future hip joint function. CT is very helpful in definitive treatment planning of pelvic (especially acetabular) fractures but may be delayed until other life-threatening injuries have been addressed. Plain radiography is also well suited to evaluation of chest wall trauma. When multiple ribs are fractured in two places, the radiologist should suggest the possibility of flail chest. Sternal fractures and multiple rib fractures, including the first three ribs, may herald life-threatening vascular or cardiac damage. To summarize, the radiologist contributes most to the care of the trauma patient by recognizing roentgen patterns of injury, knowing which are commonly accompanied by damage to critical soft tissues, and performing the indicated radiographic studies efficiently.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary arterial changes in mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome were evaluated by retrospectively analyzing 62 coronary angiograms of 42 patients with abnormal coronary arteries. A total of 108 aneurysms on the initial studies were classified as follows: eight diffuse, 18 saccular, and 50 fusiform aneurysms and 32 localized areas of dilatation. These were also classified as large, medium, or small aneurysms. Approximately one-third of the aneurysms were in the right coronary artery and two-thirds in the left. Seventy percent of the aneurysms were located in the proximal portion of the coronary artery, 16% in the middle portion, and 14% in the distal portion. Sixteen patients were followed up with angiography for periods ranging from 4 months to 8 years 11 months. At follow-up, 48% of the 62 aneurysms had regressed to normal, 37% were diminished in size, and 10% were unchanged. Small and medium-sized aneurysms frequently showed complete regression. In contrast, large aneurysms tended to persist, and stenotic lesions formed at or adjacent to the aneurysm in 41%. Aneurysms larger than 9 mm in diameter, especially those that were diffuse in shape, carried a high risk of subsequent total occlusion.\r"

Conventional chest radiography was performed at 120 kVp with Lanex regular screens (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and Kodak Ortho-G or Ortho-C film (Eastman Kodak). The 253 volunteer patients were examined with both techniques. The chest radiographs were interpreted by four radiologists. The study group was composed of 58 normal and 195 abnormal posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs. In 31 cases there were two major radiologic diagnoses. The number of correct interpretations increased when the SER images were examined, compared with the conventional Ortho-G (chi 2 = 4.17, P less than .05) and conventional Ortho-C (chi 2 = 16.9, P less than .001) radiographs. The overall accuracy of disease detection improved for all radiologists with the SER system. There was no disease category in which the accuracy of interpretation decreased when the SER system was used. The SER system is a clinically reliable method of improving image quality and increasing diagnostic accuracy.\r"

For statistical purposes the result in each single bronchus from the level of the trachea to the segmental bronchi was considered separately. A total of 361 abnormal and 1,413 normal bronchi were confirmed with bronchoscopy or surgery. Observers A and B identified 100% and 99%, respectively, of the abnormal bronchi and 97% and 96%, respectively, of the normal bronchi on CT scans. For the standard CT examination (8-mm-thick sections) a sensitivity of 94% (observer A) or 91% (observer B) and a specificity of 99% (observers A and B) were found in the diagnosis of a normal or narrowed bronchial lumen. CT proved to be a reliable method for demonstrating tumor lesions of the bronchi.\r"

In the middle lobe, a medial subsegmental bronchus of a lateral segmental bronchus and a superior and inferior subsegmental bronchus of a medial segmental bronchus are always located medial to the corresponding artery. In other words, the anatomic relationship between the subsegmental bronchi and the corresponding pulmonary arteries in the upper lobe is opposite to that in the middle lobe. One hundred seventeen cases, including 54 cases of lobar volume loss, were reviewed with this method, and in each case it was possible to differentiate the upper lobe from the middle lobe without the contiguous section analysis.\r"

Of the 73 women in the study, 60 presented with clinical findings related to the tumor.

The right breast was the site of disappearing calcifications more often than the left. The most common configuration of disappearing calcifications was round or oval. All calcifications but one were found in dense glandular areas of the breast. Dense glandular tissue within 1 cm of the border with the stroma was the most common location. Only one of 20 foci suggested malignancy. The disappearance of breast calcifications is uncommon but probably not rare.\r"

Localization scores of I-131 MIBG accumulation in the primary tumor or metastatic site ranged from 0 to 3+ on the basis of comparison with normal liver. I-131 MIBG uptake varied greatly in different patients with carcinoid tumors. The localization scores in known tumor sites were related to the location of the primary tumor in the stomach (1-3+ in two of five patients), pancreas (1-3+ in four of five patients), cecum (3+ in two of two patients), appendix (0 in one of one patient), jejunum (0 in one of one patient), Meckel diverticulum (3+ in one of one patient), terminal ileum (2-3+ in 19 of 28 patients), bronchus (3+ in one of nine patients), thymus (1+ in one of two patients), and unknown (2-3+ in 18 of 28 patients). Tumors of midgut origin concentrated I-131 MIBG more frequently than those of foregut origin. Uptake of I-131 MIBG was more likely if neurohumor levels, particularly serum serotonin, were elevated. There was no relationship of I-131 MIBG uptake to carcinoid syndrome. I-131 MIBG is useful in the determination of the location and extent of some carcinoid tumors, particularly those of midgut origin.\r"

The most common predisposing causes were previous gastric outlet surgery and persimmon ingestion. Twelve patients underwent contrast material-enhanced studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and one patient underwent a barium enema study. These examinations revealed four gastric, two duodenal, and eight small bowel phytobezoars in 10 patients. The obstruction caused by small bowel phytobezoars frequently occurred in the jejunum or proximal ileum, more proximally than has been reported in previous series. Barium studies are useful in differentiating obstruction due to postoperative adhesions from obstruction caused by bezoars. In addition, barium studies enable the detection of residual gastric bezoars. This information has important implications in patient treatment because bezoar obstruction is unlikely to respond to conservative treatment, and concurrent gastric bezoars must be removed to prevent recurrent bowel obstruction.\r"

Intensity ratios between both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcted areas and normal myocardium increased significantly up to 15-20 minutes after administration of Gd-DTPA and were still elevated 30 minutes after injection (P less than .0001). In accordance with the findings in experimental studies, four distribution patterns of infarct enhancement were observed. The overlap in enhancement patterns and similar maximal intensity ratios after Gd-DTPA administration for both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts preclude a reliable differentiation on the basis of these factors alone. Significant enhancement of both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts allows adequate infarct imaging up to at least 30 minutes after administration of Gd-DTPA.\r"

At a follow-up period of 2-12 months, intravenous digital subtraction angiograms demonstrated patency of the vessels with stents in 40 of 45 patients. The mean Doppler ankle/arm index increased from 0.60 to 0.92 immediately after treatment and was 0.89 at follow-up. Early thrombotic stent occlusion occurred in two patients. Intimal hyperplasia was a late effect and led to stent stenoses in three patients after 5-9 months and stent occlusion in one patient after 6 months. In three patients, percutaneous recanalization with balloon and Simpson catheters was successful. Intravascular stents proved particularly useful for maintenance of patency after angioplasty in occlusions of the iliac and femoral arteries and in treatment of stenoses due to eccentric and severely ulcerated plaques. The stents also helped manage complications after angioplasty. Long-term results will depend on the degree, frequency, and progression of intimal hyperplasia narrowing the vascular lumen.\r"

In the normal testis, P-31 MR spectra had prominent phosphomonoester (PME) and adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) peaks. Testicular torsion dramatically reduced ATP to almost undetectable levels and significantly decreased the PME/Pi at 1 hour (1.18 +/- 0.22) in nine rats. In two rats, however, no spectral changes were present. Of the six rats in which detorsion was performed, three showed immediate regeneration of ATP and a normal PME/Pi (2.87 +/- 0.06) 3 hours later; testicles in the other three rats did not recover (PME/Pi = 0.72 +/- 0.01). Because gross morphologic observations and histologic findings prior to detorsion were unable to differentiate viable from nonviable tests, these preliminary data suggest P-31 MR spectroscopy may help clinicians diagnose testicular torsion and assess testicular viability.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine patients with Graves ophthalmopathy were examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 0.5 T with use of a surface coil. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images were obtained, and T2 relaxation times of eye muscles and retrobulbar fat were calculated from a multiecho sequence. Normal values for T2 relaxation times of eye muscle were obtained by examining nine control subjects. MR imaging demonstrated eye muscle enlargement in 23 patients. Visual examination of T2-weighted and calculated T2 images showed areas of high signal intensity in enlarged eye muscles of 12 of 23 patients. Calculated T2 relaxation times of eye muscles differed significantly between control subjects and patients with stage III and IV disease. Signal intensity characteristics of these changes, as well as their correlation with well-known histologic findings, suggested their interpretation as edema caused by acute inflammation. Since computed tomography is not able to depict eye muscle edema, the MR findings of structural changes within enlarged eye muscles might have an impact on therapeutic decisions concerning the application of anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

The benign lesions had nonhomogeneous appearances on MR images due primarily to varying degrees of free-water resorption and protein concentration. The tumors had primarily homogeneous low-to-intermediate signal intensities due to their highly cellular composition.\r"

MR imaging clearly demonstrated the course of the fifth nerve from its root entry zone (REZ) to the Meckel cave and its relationship to the surrounding vertebrobasilar system. In the six patients with trigeminal neuralgia, the presence of a vascular structure at the REZ of the fifth nerve was identified. In the 85 asymptomatic patients, examination of 170 trigeminal nerves revealed that 30% had contact between a vascular structure and the fifth nerve at the REZ, but only 2% had actual deformity. These results indicate that although neurovascular contact may be asymptomatic, MR demonstration of a vascular structure at the REZ of the fifth cranial nerve in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia may implicate this as the cause of symptoms, which may influence the treatment of choice. Because of the inherent limitations of computed tomography in the visualization of posterior fossa structures, MR imaging should be considered the initial screening procedure in the assessment of patients with trigeminal neuralgia.\r"

  ".W": "A decrease in the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging bandwidth can be used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at constant imaging time or to maintain the S/N for reduction of imaging time. The effect of bandwidth reduction from the default value of 16 kHz to 8 kHz was evaluated prospectively in 50 patients referred for MR imaging of the head. On intermediate (2,000/30 [repetition time msec/echo time msec]) and more T2-weighted (2,000/90) studies, there were no definite missed diagnoses and no diagnostically important changes in lesion characteristics when the reduced-bandwidth technique was used to obtain half- or quarter-time studies, excluding differences attributable to unintentional changes in patient position between image acquisitions. Chemical shift misregistration artifacts associated with reduced bandwidth are easily recognized with experience and do not interfere with diagnosis, as the artifacts occur in characteristic locations and diminish in most anatomic locations with increasing echo time. This study suggests the feasibility of reduced-bandwidth techniques in clinical MR imaging of the head at high field strength to achieve an increased S/N, to decrease imaging time, or to obtain images in additional projections.\r"

This combination of motion compensation also reduced motion artifacts more than did either technique alone. Further improvement in C/N was sought by using a variable-bandwidth pulse sequence, which was compared to a conventional spin-echo sequence. The variable-bandwidth technique increased the C/N of the second-echo image by 27%. The combined use of gating, flow compensation, and the variable-bandwidth option produced high-resolution brain images with a single excitation and retained flexibility in number of sections, number of echoes, and echo times.\r"

MR imaging documented the distribution of affected muscles and the absence of focal hematoma, fascial herniation, subsequent fibrosis, and fatty infiltration. Pain associated with strain and that occurring several days after exercise were both associated with prolongation of muscle T1 and T2. In a prospective evaluation of delayed-onset muscle soreness, abnormalities depicted at MR imaging persisted longer than symptoms by up to 3 weeks, indicating that MR imaging is sensitive to tissue alteration that is not apparent clinically. Highly trained marathon runners tended to have relatively mild abnormalities involving the myotendinous junctions.\r"

This was facilitated by the presence of a chemical shift artifact at the tumor-marrow interface on the T1-weighted images.

The T2 value of the tumor soft-tissue component decreased in patients who were deemed to have responded well to therapy. Two patients with very high T2 values after chemotherapy developed wide-spread metastatic disease and died. Phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy of five patients with osteosarcoma showed elevated levels of phosphomonoesters (PMEs), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and phosphodiesters (PDEs). PME and PDE peak areas decreased in three patients after chemotherapy, while Pi peak areas increased.\r"

Forty (19%) joints were considered normal; none of these exhibited osteoarthritis. One hundred thirty-nine (64%) joints were grade 1; osteoarthritis was found in 17%. Thirty-seven (17%) were grade 2; osteoarthritis was found in 95%. All forty normal joints had high or intermediate signal intensity in the disk. Osteoarthritic joints had a higher percentage of disks with diminished intensity (P less than .0001).

The authors' review of radiographs of both hands in nine patients and of both feet in six patients with Werner syndrome documented the frequent occurrence of phalangeal sclerosis related predominantly to endosteal thickening. In the hand, sclerosis was present in every patient, was generally symmetric in distribution, predominated in the distal phalanges, and demonstrated an ulnar predilection. Similar changes in the phalanges of the feet were demonstrated in only two patients. The presence of osteosclerosis in the phalanges of the hand alone or both the hand and foot, when combined with osteoporosis and periarticular calcification, suggests the diagnosis of Werner syndrome.\r"

The Y-90 microspheres were injected via a hepatic artery catheter. In this group of patients, no toxicity was observed for absorbed doses of between 5,000 and 10,000 cGy to the liver and up to 32,000 cGy to the tumor itself. Tumor response was seen only at the higher absorbed doses. The new Y-90 glass microspheres can safely deliver large doses of internal radiation to hepatic tumors as long as extrahepatic shunting can be excluded. Extrahepatic shunting will be the main limitation to this form of radiation therapy.\r"

Placement of a 12-F Silastic catheter in one procedure, a 10-F catheter in three, a 9-F catheter in one, and a 7-F catheter in two was successful and uncomplicated. Of the three surviving patients, two had a functioning catheter at 1 week and 32 months, respectively; in the third patient the catheter was removed after 3 weeks, a few days after successful bowel surgery. Two patients with functioning catheters died, one of metastatic breast cancer after 12 months and the other of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome after 5 weeks. One patient twice required removal of a functioning catheter due to sepsis, the first after 3 weeks and the second after 6 weeks. These results show this technique to be safe and successful for selected patients.\r"

The first cases involved attempted retrograde cholangiography through the jejunal limb in children who had undergone Roux-Y portoenterostomies, followed by cases of percutaneous placement of U tubes and an attempt at percutaneous creation of an hepaticojejunostomy. When a limb from the Roux-Y has been brought to the skin and marked with clips, jejunal puncture is easily performed, is well tolerated by patients, and may be repeated frequently. It also appears that after Roux-Y choledochojejunostomy, the Roux-Y limb is fixed and may be punctured with relative safety. Since access from below is more favorable for intrabiliary manipulations, the transjejunal approach expands the armamentarium of the interventional radiologist in the combined radiologic and surgical management of complex biliary disease.\r"

While palliation results from this procedure, one of the major drawbacks to its use is the immediate short-term side effects, especially the right upper quadrant and epigastric pain experienced by all patients. High doses of intravenous narcotics have been used for pain control. The data on 18 patients who received a celiac plexus block immediately prior to 31 HAE procedures were compared with those on 19 control patients who underwent 42 HAE procedures without celiac plexus block. All patients who received a celiac plexus block had relief of pain without requiring intravenous analgesic both during the procedure and for the first 8 hours after HAE. These patients also subsequently received substantially lower dosages of analgesics than the control subjects. Two patients had transient hypotension due to the celiac plexus block, but no other complications occurred. It is recommended that patients undergoing HAE first receive a celiac plexus block for pain control.\r"

One hundred four tube changes in 74 patients with percutaneous nephrostomy tubes and documented positive urine cultures were studied. Patients were arbitrarily divided into groups receiving and not receiving antibiotics before nephrostomy tube change. Asymptomatic bacteremia was documented in 11 of 104 tube changes (11%). Results of five blood cultures were positive in the group receiving antibiotics, and six cases of bacteremia occurred in the group not receiving antibiotics (P = .96). Routine nephrostomy/stent change can cause frequent, asymptomatic bacteremia in patients with colonization of bacteria in the urinary tract. Antibiotic prophylaxis was unsuccessful in preventing transient bacteremia, a factor that may have implications in patients with underlying valvular heart disease and other patients at risk for bacteremia.\r"

These documents are reviewed by all other RRCs, the parent organizations of the sponsoring RRC, and the ACGME and other interested groups. When all suggestions from these groups are answered by the RRC, the Committee for Review of Special Requirements of the ACGME must approve the program. The final step is ACGME approval. The program will then go into effect on the date specified in the Justification/Impact statement. The procedure is complex and time-consuming. However, in the final analysis, a subspecialty program accredited in this fashion will be a solid educational experience for the trainee and should have a well-defined role in the parent institution.\r"

PTA was accomplished through an antegrade puncture of the common femoral artery. The angiographic criterion for technical success was restoration of the vessel lumen with no significant residual stenosis. The authors report technical success in 64 (91%) of their patients, an improvement over a technical success rate of 74% in their previous series of 46 other PTA patients with occlusions 1-20 cm long. In this series, no complications related to PTA necessitated emergency surgical intervention. Refinements in PTA can be attributed to changes in patient selection and medication, improvements in balloon catheters and guide wires, and greater proficiency on the part of angiographers. This update reflects currently achievable results with standard angioplasty techniques, and it is against such results that all new vascular recanalization techniques, including laser-assisted PTA, should be compared.\r"

Several of these devices are now in multicenter investigative trials. The atherolytic reperfusion wire incorporates a 0.035-inch guide wire with a modified tip to recanalize the lumen through the totally obstructed vascular segment. Clinical experience in the initial 12 patients has been successful. The Kensey catheter, a high-speed rotational recanalization device, has been used in 110 patients in a multicenter trial. Technical success has been reported in 77% of the patients and clinical success in 55% of the patients, with follow-up periods of 3 months to 1 year. The transluminal extraction catheter (TEC) is a torque-controlled atherectomy catheter that incorporates an aspiration device into a distal rotational cutter. Consequently, distal embolization has not been a clinical problem in the 95 patients treated with the TEC catheter for peripheral vascular disease. Technical success has been accomplished in 87 (92%) patients. Three-month follow-up studies in 16 patients showed that restenosis occurred in four, two of whom had undergone combined atherectomy and angioplasty.\r"
