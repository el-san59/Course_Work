  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that a peptide enteral formula significantly attenuates the intestinal water and albumin loss in volume-expanded rats with acute hypoproteinemia. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative abilities of the fat, carbohydrate, and protein components of the peptide enteral formula to stimulate water absorption and attenuate albumin turnover in intact jejunal segments during hypoproteinemia induced by intravenous infusion of Tyrode's solution (2.5 ml/min/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Radio iodinated albumin movement from blood to lumen was used to estimate mucosal albumin clearance. Net transmucosal water was measured using a volume recovery method. When compared to luminal perfusion with Tyrode's solution (control animals), protein (as a protein hydrolysate) or protein combined with fat significantly enhanced fluid absorption (P less than 0.05) before and during volume expansion. This did not occur with carbohydrates or when carbohydrate was combined with the protein hydrolysate. However, the hypoproteinemia-induced increase in mucosal albumin clearance was significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated by all solutions containing the carbohydrate component of the diet. These findings indicate that the protein component of the enteral formula is responsible for the enhanced net transmucosal water movement in hypoproteinemic animals. However, the carbohydrate component is largely responsible for the decrease in intestinal albumin clearance.\r"

  ".W": "The introduction of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs into treatment schemes for the stimulation of ovulation has enabled the authors' in vitro fertilization (IVF) team to overcome two problems; they can now suppress spontaneous LH peaks and program their activity. Two hundred and five IVF cycles were investigated. The agent used was D-Trp-6-LH-RH, either in a sustained release formulation (112 cases, group 1) or in a standard form (93 cases, group 2). The quantity of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) necessary for adequate ovarian stimulation was much lower when the standard form of the analog was used. The number of oocytes recovered per puncture was greater in group 1 (7.6 compared with 5.1), but the difference was not significant when considering the number of embryos (2.4 compared with 2.1). The corrected pregnancy rate (with allowance for progressive introduction of freezing from the third embryo onwards) was identical in both groups. The authors conclude that systems in which LH-RH analogs are employed have a clear advantage over the classical treatment with clomiphene citrate/hMG, and that the immediate-action formulation of D-Trp-6-LH-RH is preferable.\r"

The aim of this study was to characterize hormonal changes induced by short-term administration of agonist, and to evaluate a putative impact of the flare-up effect on follicular recruitment and subsequent IVF. Eighteen highly selected patients were randomely divided in two groups. Nine patients received a short-term administration of Buserelin (Hoechst, AG, Franfurt/Main, FRG) (day 1). They were compared with 9 patients who were exposed to a long-term protocol (day 21), and 13 control patients. Agonist-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increase, in early follicular phase, stimulated follicular growth, shortened follicular phase, and induced a transient rise in progesterone. This was followed by a phase of reduced LH secretion associated with a significant modification of LH immunoreactivity. The short-term regimen did not improve the follicular recruitment, and appeared to reduce the oocytes fertilization rate and embryo quality when compared with prolonged administration of peptide.\r"

A modified laparoscopic follicular aspiration needle is described. Purified FSH/hMG ovarian stimulation significantly improved the mean serum estradiol levels, number of preovulatory follicles, and, therefore, the total number of oocytes recovered per cycle. The mean ratios of oocytes recovered per preovulatory follicle documented on ultrasound, and per aspirated follicle, increased significantly using sharpened needles.

Ova were recovered from three women between 96 and 144 hours after ovulation. However, no ova were recovered from the other three donors, two of whom were later noted to be pregnant. Retained pregnancies occurred despite postlavage administration of high-dose contraceptive pills, endometrial aspiration, and, in one case, RU 486. None of the infertile women became pregnant as a result of the trial. The authors conclude that, although superovulation may increase ovum production, without reliable contragestion, such practice is unsafe for ovum donors undergoing uterine lavage.\r"

The control group consisted of eight eumenorrheic women. Luteinizing hormone levels, LH amplitudes, and total urinary excretion/24 hours did not differ between ovulatory and anovulatory TUs, but were significantly higher compared with the control group. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in PCOD did not differ from normal cycles. Androgen values in the anovulatory TUs were significantly higher compared with the ovulatory TUs (P = 0.001). We conclude that LH-RH therapy may result in ovulation; however, it does not redress the intrinsic abnormality in PCOD and FSH, and androgen levels do not seem to be critical in ovulation induction.\r"

In 8 of 9 anovulatory women, there was no follicular development despite a significant rise in serum gonadotrophin concentrations within 3 to 5 days of starting CC. There were no significant differences between the ovulatory and anovulatory groups in the peak response of either luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The authors conclude that, in women with polycystic ovaries, the most common reason for the failure to ovulate is an absent ovarian response to an appropriate rise in serum FSH.\r"

Their growth did not change during ovulation induction with menotropins. Although the mechanism of ovarian cyst formation during GnRH agonist treatment is not clear, their presence does not appear to interfere with the fertility of these women.\r"

Patients (n = 27) with documented abnormal Insler scores in repetitive cycles and failure to conceive with traditional treatments were screened with conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for estrogen responsiveness of the cervix. Only 5 patients were found unresponsive. Seventeen patients with CEE-responsive cervices then were treated with human gonadotropins (hMG), initially 1 ampule days 5 to 11. If the mucus failed to improve, the hMG was increased to standard doses. Eight patients responded to 1 ampule hMG with improved mucus and conception. The remainder required 2 ampules hMG. In patient cycles with corrected cervical mucus, the viable fecundibility (fv) was 0.35. This is significantly higher than predicted for this population (fv = 0.09; P less than 0.01). In all, 14 of 17 patients conceived viable pregnancies during hMG treatment. It is concluded that graduated hMG is efficacious in treating patients with abnormal cervical mucus responsive to CEE. It is preferable to either in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer, based on both cost and efficacy for most patients.\r"

D-Trp-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) microcapsules were administered intramuscularly at menstruation and menotropin (hMG) stimulation was started 19 days (mean) later. In 3 cycles (2.7%), only early luteinization occurred. The mean number of oocytes per cycle was 6.7, with a fertilization and cleavage rate of 50 and 95%, respectively. A mean of 3.4 embryos were transferred per cycle. The 111 cycles resulted in 34 clinical pregnancies, 41% per cycle with embryo transfer. The early abortion, multiple pregnancy, and ovarian hyperstimulation rates were 24, 18, and 11%, respectively. It is concluded that D-Trp-6-LH-RH/hMG cycles are associated with a very low occurrence of early luteinization, high number of oocytes and embryos, and a substantial incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Between November 1977 and January 1987, 55 transplantations of pancreas segments from living donors related to their recipients were performed at the University of Minnesota. A preliminary analysis of metabolic test results in donors tested 1 yr after hemipancreatectomy showed an increase in mean glucose and a decrease in mean insulin values during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in 18 donors, a 14% increase in the mean of the mean glucose levels during 24-h metabolic profiles in 12 donors, and a decrease of 45% in the mean 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion in 21 donors. Including the studies performed postdonation, 11 of 31 (35%) donors developed an abnormal OGTT result. In a retrospective analysis, preoperative results of intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) and cortisone-stimulated OGTTs were found to be statistically significant predictors of an abnormal OGTT after hemipancreatectomy. The mean of the 5- to 50-min IVGTT insulin values was the best predictive test. With the cutoff value set at 62 microU/ml, this test result had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 83%, and a positive predictive value of 75% for identifying donors who developed an abnormal OGTT. The sum of the 5- and 10-min IVGTT insulin (cutoff 140 microU/ml) had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 67%, and a predictive value of only 60%, whereas the delta-insulin had values of 86, 71, and 60%, respectively. Both the IVGTT mean insulin and the sum of the 5-min and 10-min insulin test results were 100% predictive of an abnormal test (0% risk), but the IVGTT mean insulin excluded the lowest proportion of otherwise suitable donors (a low \"false-alarm\" rate). The IVGTT mean insulin can be used to identify or exclude potential donors who would develop an abnormal OGTT result should hemipancreatectomy be performed.\r"

The final islet volume was 240 microliter, with purity of 70-90% (large islets) and 20-40% (small islets). Perifusion with glucose elicited a biphasic release of insulin, with the response rising sixfold from basal secretion. Implantation of pure islets under the kidney capsule of normal or streptozocin-induced diabetic nude mice resulted in human C-peptide secretion and partial or complete reversal of hyperglycemia, confirmed by histological recovery. The data show that these methods provide large quantities of viable purified human islets.\r"

With MHC class II antibody OX6 (anti-I-A), M0-DCs were strongly labeled in both rat strains on the surface and on internal structures. Three of five particularly high titered batches of OX6 revealed MHC class II expression on VE and beta-cells.

In this study we examined the effect of gamma-irradiation on mouse islet-allograft survival. In a B6AF1 isograft model, irradiation up to 2400 rad did not induce deterioration of islet function over 200 days, but greater doses caused cessation of graft function between 83 and 186 days. When DBA/2 crude islets were transplanted into B6AF1 recipients, all nonirradiated allografts were acutely rejected. Marked prolongation of allograft survival was achieved by islet irradiation with doses between 800 and 12,000 rad. With higher doses, significant numbers of allografts survived beyond the controls, but many lost function between 78 and 180 days, with none surviving greater than 200 days. Irradiation with 16,000 rad caused acute radiation damage. Because most secondary islet allografts in recipient mice that lost primary islet-graft function between 84 and 195 days survived greater than 100 days, late functional loss was probably due to the radiation injury. Combined use of recipient treatment with cyclosporin A and graft irradiation (2400 rad) achieved prolongation of DBA/2 islets in B6AF1 mice.\r"

To define the role of autoimmune response to transplanted islets, the possibility of a rejection response must be prevented. To accomplish this in spontaneously diabetic BB rats, we induced neonatal tolerance. We found that recurrent autoimmunity in tolerant BB rats can be prevented by treatment of recipients with the monoclonal antibody OX8 (specific for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) but not W3/25 (specific for helper T-lymphocytes). These findings provide direct evidence for the role of OX8-bearing lymphocytes in autoimmune diabetogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The toxic effects of FK-506 (FK), a newly discovered immunosuppressive agent isolated from Streptomyces tsukubaensis, were studied in the human fetal pancreas (HFP) system. Human fetal pancreas explants (14-21 wk gestation) were cultured up to 72 h with either 10(-10) to 10(-7) M FK or 10(-8) to 10(-5) M cyclosporin A (CsA), then examined histologically and functionally with a stimulated insulin-release assay. Additionally, FK and CsA were tested for the ability to suppress cell-mediated immunity with a human mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Previous studies have demonstrated that near-complete immunosuppression is obtained with FK at 10(-8) M and CsA at 10(-6) M. When cultured up to 72 h throughout the concentration range, neither FK nor CsA altered HFP cellular architecture, and indirect immunoperoxidase staining for insulin demonstrated no change in quantity or distribution of insulin-producing beta-cells compared with control tissue. Drug-cultured HFP also retained the ability to release insulin in response to a glucose/theophylline challenge. Finally, 50% inhibition of a human MLR was achieved with FK at 2 x 10(-9) M and CsA at 2 x 10(-7) M, demonstrating the 100-fold greater potency of FK. Our results suggest that further work with FK will show that this immunosuppressive agent can be used with HFP transplantation into diabetic patients without toxicity to HFP.\r"

In the pancreatectomized dog, prior donor-specific kidney transplantation has an adverse effect on subsequent islet-graft survival.\r"

To assess the effect of the site of transplantation, we compared the hormonal responses to glucose (500 mg/kg i.v.) of intraportal (IP) and intrasplenic (IS) islet autografts in the cynomolgus monkey previously rendered diabetic by total pancreatectomy. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) 6 wk after IP grafting (n = 10) demonstrated nearly normal plasma glucose changes, with qualitatively normal but quantitatively reduced insulin and glucagon responses; only two animals have maintained these responses for greater than 2 yr. IVGTTs 6 wk after IS grafting (n = 4) demonstrated more abnormal plasma glucose changes, with qualitatively normal but weak insulin responses and glucagon levels that did not fall in response to hyperglycemia; only one animal has maintained fasting normoglycemia for greater than 9 mo. These results suggest that IS transplantation confers no benefit over IP transplantation in this model.\r"

By the use of a simple scoring system, the effect of the cooling rate, treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), rate of thawing, and postthaw culture were examined. These studies showed the most effective method to be a 24-h culture of islets, followed by partial incubation with 20% DMSO at 0 degrees C, followed by seeding at -8 degrees C in an alcohol bath. The islets were then cooled at a rate of -0.25 degrees C/min to -40 degrees C followed by quenching in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C. Rapid thawing at 37 degrees C was then followed by a 24-h culture. Islets from four Lewis rat donors were cryopreserved, counted, and transplanted intraportally into streptozocin-induced diabetic Lewis rats. Corresponding control transplants were performed with islets from four donors only cultured for 48 h. The results showed that reversal of hyperglycemia in severely diabetic rats was obtained at 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, or 8 days with cryopreserved islets from four donors, compared to reversal of diabetes at 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 days with islets from four donors subjected to culture alone. The new cryopreservation technique has several small modifications over previously described methods and results in a significant improvement in islet survival.\r"

Despite normal fasting glucose and insulin levels, glucose tolerance was reduced in the islet-transplanted dogs (1.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.4%/min in normal controls, P less than .002). The reduction in glucose tolerance was due to a reduced insulin response to glucose injection (4 +/- 1 vs. 32 +/- 5 microU/ml, P less than .001) and reduced glucose effectiveness (1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.6 x 10(2) min-1, P less than .005) but not to a reduction in insulin sensitivity (8.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) min-1.microU-1.ml-1, P greater than .5).

Four, 8, 14, or 56 days after the transplantation, 2 to 3 x 10(5) microspheres (10 micron diam) were injected into either the portal vein or the abdominal aorta of anesthetized animals. The presence of microspheres within the islet grafts was determined in stained sections of the livers. In general, the number of microspheres in the liver sections was greater than 10 times higher in mice given microspheres via the portal route. When the microspheres were administered via the arterial system 2 wk after transplantation, approximately 20-30% of the islet sections contained microspheres; only occasional spheres were found in the islets after intraportal administration. This was the case even when as many as 56 days had elapsed. Some but not all mice investigated 4 and 8 days after transplantation had islets that contained microspheres. The intraportally implanted islets in hyperglycemic animals had decreased revascularization compared with normoglycemic mice 2 wk after implantation. The results indicate that intraportally implanted syngeneic pancreatic islets become revascularized mainly from the hepatic artery and that this process starts as early as during the 1st wk postimplantation. Furthermore, hyperglycemia seems to influence this process.\r"

Some rats were rendered diabetic with streptozocin (STZ) before being implanted with the islets, and other rats received no STZ and thus remained normoglycemic. The number of implanted islets was insufficient to revert hyperglycemia, but the STZ-induced diabetic animals were treated with insulin according to one of the following protocols: 1) one daily subcutaneous insulin injection for 28 days after transplantation; 2) insulin injection on days 1-14; 3) insulin injection on days 15-28; or 4) no insulin. Four weeks after transplantation, the blood perfusion of the islet grafts was determined by a microsphere technique. Continuous hyperglycemia after implantation of the islets significantly decreased the volume of the graft and the blood flow per volume compared with normoglycemic animals also receiving islet transplants. Insulin treatment counteracted the decrease in both of these values. This result was achieved regardless of whether the insulin treatment was maintained throughout the 4-wk period or only during the first or second half. The mechanism behind the impaired blood perfusion of the grafts during continuous hyperglycemia is unknown, but it may reflect an effect on the revascularization of the graft or on the intrinsic regulation of the blood perfusion of the graft.\r"

Islets were isolated from hamster donors, and after a period in tissue culture, they were injected into the abdominal testes of diabetic rats. Postoperatively, the rats were divided into two treatment groups. Four ACl rats received antilymphocyte serum (ALS) injections over a period of 30 days, and 13 ACl, 15 W-L, and 13 BB/Wor rats were given cyclosporin (CsA) according to the following regimen: 25 mg/kg i.p. for 7 days, then 7 mg/kg i.p. for 23 days. On day 30, immunosuppression was stopped. The results showed that none of the ALS-treated ACl rats remained normoglycemic for greater than 9 days. However, CsA therapy resulted in an extended mean duration of normoglycemia in the ACl and W-L rats of 160.0 +/- 36.0 and 131.0 +/- 31 days, respectively. By contrast, the mean duration of normoglycemia in the BB/Wor rats was 33.0 +/- 4.0 days. Furthermore, all of the BB/Wor rats reverted to diabetes after CsA was stopped. Therefore, the concomitant administration of an antigenic islet xenograft with CsA led to a state of unresponsiveness only in diabetes-resistant but not in diabetes-prone rats. Because the BB/Wor rats have demonstrable T-lymphocyte dysfunction, they may be unable to generate the CsA-induced suppressor T-lymphocytes required for the long-term acceptance of the graft by the host.\r"

Hamster islets in groups of 400-1000 encapsulated in microbeads containing 11-14% (wt/wt) agarose were xenogenically transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of five diabetic mice. The longest normoglycemic period in these mice was 53 days, which was markedly longer than the normoglycemic period obtained by nonencapsulated islets. Agarose seems to be a suitable basic material for encapsulating islets, because the islets can easily be microencapsulated without any adverse effect on the islet function.\r"

In the current study we examined whether these effects of pH are evident in other models of ileal secretion, and in a model of increased absorption. Rats were anesthetized and transport was measured in ileal loops during respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. Decreases in arterial pH increased absorption equally in control loops and in adjacent loops perfused with a Ringer's solution containing ST toxin (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated secretion), hypertonic mannitol (passive, osmotically mediated secretion), or glucose. Decreases in arterial pH increased absorption in a similar way in loops exposed to cholera toxin (cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated secretion) that were then perfused with glucose-Ringer's solution. Alterations in arterial and luminal pH did not affect glucose absorption. These results suggest that the effect of arterial pH on ileal absorption occurs by a mechanism that is independent of these various means of altering transport.\r"

In the other 3 responders hepatitis B surface antigen persisted in the absence of hepatitis B e antigen, replicating hepatitis B virus DNA in the liver and inflammatory disease activity. Two of these responders with persistent hepatitis B surface antigen had hepatitis B virus DNA integrated into the hepatocyte genome and 1 responder had nonreplicating, episomal virus DNA. In the control group of 10 patients one spontaneous remission occurred. Antiviral treatment was significantly (p less than 0.05) more successful within the first 4 yr after infection (5 responders of 6 treated patients) than after longer disease duration (no responder of 4 treated patients).

We therefore studied bile acid and bile lipid metabolism in the following groups of rats, with and without bile fistula: (a) nonfasted, orally fed controls, (b) orally fed controls fasted for 20 h, and (c) after 7 days of total parenteral nutrition. Biliary bile acid concentration (35.4 +/- 2.5 mM) and secretion (253 +/- 20.0 mumol/100 g body wt.24 h) increased significantly in the rats on TPN and the rats fasted for 20 h (38.8 +/- 2.5 and 243 +/- 23.4 mM, respectively) when compared with the orally fed controls (26.5 +/- 2.5 and 178 +/- 23.5 mM, respectively). Bile flow, however, was unchanged. Bile acid pool size (Eriksson washout technique) also increased from 43.4 +/- 3.0 mumol/100 g body wt in the controls to 50.5 +/- 4.8 in the group fasted for 20 h and 65.6 +/- 5.3 in the TPN group (p less than 0.05-0.01). Similar bile acid pool sizes (carcass extraction method) were found in the nonfistulated animals. Biliary cholesterol secretion and saturation were significantly less in the TPN rats than in the other two groups. Liver microscopy indicated only minimal fatty change, but serum bile acid and alkaline phosphatase levels were increased in the TPN group (p less than 0.05). Thus, during TPN bile acids stagnate within the enterohepatic circulation, increasing biliary bile acid concentration and secretion rates and expanding the pool size. However, the absence of an associated choleresis, together with abnormal liver function tests, suggest that alterations in bile acid metabolism cause a relative cholestasis in this model.\r"

As starch is hydrolyzed to glucose that is subsequently oxidized to CO2, the excretion of 13CO2 after starch intake, compared with the excretion of 13CO2 after glucose intake, should be a measure of starch hydrolysis. In normal subjects both the hourly 13CO2 excretion rate and the cumulative percentage of 13CO2 excretion after starch ingestion were significantly different from those after glucose ingestion. Comparable differences were found with the patient group. In addition, the 13CO2 excretion after starch intake in normal subjects was markedly different from that of patients with pancreatic disease. Even after correction for endocrine pancreatic insufficiency by calculating the ratio of 13CO2 excretion after starch intake over 13CO2 excretion after glucose intake, the difference between the control group and the patient group was statistically significant. This study indicates that starch hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in starch digestion. It also confirms recent findings suggesting that starch digestion is impaired in some patients with pancreatic disease. The 13CO2 starch breath test may prove to be useful in evaluating the digestibility of various starch preparations in physiologic and pathological conditions.\r"

Isoproterenol or furosemide were given against a background infusion of 5% D-glucose (placebo day) or atrial natriuretic factor (experimental day). Atrial natriuretic factor abolished the rise in plasma renin activity caused by isoproterenol (p = 0.003) and significantly (p = 0.048) attenuated the rise in plasma renin activity after a bolus injection of furosemide. These results show that a pharmacological dose of atrial natriuretic factor inhibits stimulated renin release in humans. This attenuation is apparent with two heterogenous stimuli, which suggests a nonspecific effect.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of D-penicillamine (D-Pen) on angiogenesis, we have studied the effects of this drug on in vitro proliferation of human endothelial cells (EC) and in vivo corneal neovascularization. D-Pen, in the presence of copper sulfate, suppressed tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation into EC in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition was observed with D-Pen concentrations attainable in the serum and tissues of treated patients. Neither D-Pen nor copper ion alone significantly affected [3H]TdR incorporation into EC. The inhibition by D-Pen and copper was blocked by catalase (CAT) or horseradish peroxidase but not by boiled CAT or SOD. When rabbits were daily injected intravenously with D-Pen at the per kilogram dosage administered to rheumatoid patients, neovascularization as quantitated by the proliferation of corneal new blood vessels was significantly inhibited. These results suggest that hydrogen peroxide generated by D-Pen and copper exerts a pronounced antiangiogenic effect through inhibition of EC proliferation. It is, therefore, considered that D-Pen may suppress rheumatoid synovitis by reducing the number of small blood vessels available for the emigration of chronic inflammatory cells, and the proliferation of the synovial tissue.\r"

We have identified monospecific human autoantibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRP) in the sera of rheumatic patients. Since this nuclear enzyme has been extensively characterized, and its entire structure is known, we could investigate in detail the epitope specificity of the human autoantibodies, and their effects on the biological functions of the enzyme. All sera with autoantibodies to ADPRP recognized the NAD-binding domain of the enzyme, as demonstrated by either immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation of partially proteolyzed ADPRP. The autoantibodies also inhibited the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme, as measured by the transfer of ADP-ribose from [32P]NAD to either histones or to ADPRP itself. Because comparative structural analyses have shown that the active sites of enzymes are often conserved during evolution, we tested the ability of the autoantibodies to react with ADPRP from lower eukaryotes. The human autoantibodies reacted with ADPRP in cellular extracts from mammalian, avian, amphibian, arthropod, and protozoan cells, and also inhibited the catalytic activity of the various enzymes. Collectively, these experiments indicate that the human autoantibodies to ADPRP recognize a distinct group of evolutionarily conserved antigenic determinants that are closely related to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the epitope selectivity of human autoantibodies to ADPRP is influenced by cross-reactive antigens in the external environment.\r"

  ".W": "The isolated perfused hearts of rabbits previously subjected to in vivo left ventricular myocardial infarction (LVMI) show a 5-10-fold increase in f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) and bradykinin (BK)-stimulated eicosanoid metabolite production relative to noninfarcted hearts. This exaggerated arachidonate metabolism has been shown to occur primarily in the cardiac atria, a site remote from the zone of injury and to be associated with a 10-15-fold increase in atrial FMLP receptor number in the absence of atrial inflammation. All of these changes were temporally related to leukocyte infiltration into the infarct zone. To determine whether invading leukocytes mediate these responses, acute inflammatory cell influx was suppressed either by inducing leukopenia with nitrogen mustard or by administration of BW-755C, a mixed cyclooxygenase-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both pharmacological manipulations resulted in a decrease in inflammatory cells in the infarct zone and a marked suppression (50-70%) of ex vivo agonist-stimulated eicosanoid metabolite production from perfused hearts and isolated atria. These manipulations also resulted in reversal of ex vivo FMLP-induced coronary vasoconstriction as well as augmentation of BK-induced coronary vasodilation. Further studies in nitrogen mustard-treated animals revealed a suppression of the LVMI-stimulated increase in atrial FMLP receptor number. These data show that suppression of leukocyte invasion after LVMI attenuates enhanced cardiac and atrial eicosanoid metabolite production, and results in marked changes in coronary vascular reactivity. An additional finding was that basal and stimulated LTB4 production was markedly increased in infarcted hearts. In vivo suppression of the increase in LTB4 production by BW-755C was associated with inhibition of inflammatory cell influx into the infarct zone. It therefore appears that LTB4 may be an important proinflammatory mediator of leukocyte invasion after LVMI.\r"

Treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma alone had no stimulatory effect on melanin production, but when the cells were cultured with IFN in the presence of MSH, pigment production was significantly and synergistically increased relative to cells cultured with MSH only. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that levels of tyrosinase in the cells were not affected by MSH or by IFN, which suggests that stimulation of melanogenic activity occurred by activation of a preexisting cellular enzyme. Scatchard analyses showed that the number of MSH receptors on IFN-treated cells was significantly increased (approximately 2.5-fold) relative to untreated cells (approximately 61,000/cell). These findings demonstrate that IFN stimulate differentiation (that is, pigmentation) of melanocytes by increasing the expression of surface MSH receptors; this in turn suggests that such a mechanism may in part be responsible for postinflammatory skin pigmentation, and provides an additional basis for action in the clinical responses of melanoma to IFN treatment.\r"

PTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in renal membranes from senescent rats also declined, but forskolin-stimulated activity did not change. In addition, cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin-stimulated Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux and cAMP formation were blunted in cells from aged animals. Further, cells from aged rats had decreased Gs-alpha and Gi-alpha proteins, as detected by ADP-ribosylation. These findings would be consistent with the proposal of an age-associated heterologous desensitization that involved the G-proteins. Serum concentrations of iPTH were increased in the old rat, suggesting that the desensitization to PTH in the aging rat represented an adaptive response to prolonged stimulation by the hormone. This hypothesis was supported by the findings that the attenuated PTH-sensitive Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, cAMP formation, and adenylate cyclase activity in cells from old rats could be reversed by parathyroidectomy. The decreased label in cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylated Gs-alpha and pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylated Gi-alpha found in cells from aged rats was also largely negated by the surgery. In conclusion, the results suggest that the age-related blunting in the responses of renal cells to PTH was associated with a deficit in G-protein function and that this alteration could be reversed by removal of the parathyroid gland.\r"

Enhanced lysis of resistant lymphoid and certain other solid tumor cell lines was observed only when monoclonals used reacted to class I and II HLA molecules but not non-HLA molecules on tumor targets. Enhanced lysis was not due to antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity or due to an effect of antibody on NK effectors. Of importance, normal autologous and allogeneic human lymphocytes could not be lysed by NK cells despite blast transformation with mitogens or masking of HLA membrane determinants on blasts with monoclonal antibodies. Enhanced lysis, in the presence of antibody to HLA antigens, was not due to increased NK cell binding to tumor targets, but a consequence of enhanced postbinding lysis. Studies using granules obtained from NK cells indicated that masking of HLA antigens did not enhance the susceptibility of tumor targets to cytolysins. Such observations would suggest that HLA antigens on tumor targets inhibit the triggering of effector cells (and release of cytolysins) after recognition and binding of NK cells to target cells.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the expression of the atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) gene in the ventricle of the human failing heart, we have measured ANP and ANP messenger RNA (ANPmRNA) levels in left ventricular aneurysm obtained at operation, biopsy specimens of left ventricles from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and autopsy samples of old myocardial infarction (OMI) and DCM hearts, and compared the levels with those in the normal ventricle. The ANP level (mean +/- SE) was 17.5 +/- 6.9 ng/g in the normal ventricle, and increased to 660.3 +/- 122.2 ng/g in the left ventricular aneurysm tissues and to 3,138.6 +/- 1,642.1 ng/g in the biopsy specimens of the DCM ventricle. These levels were approximately 40 and 200 times higher than in the normal ventricle. The increase of ANP levels was observed in both infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the OMI heart, and in the entire ventricle of the DCM heart. A significant positive correlation was found between the ANP level in aneurysm tissues and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.85). The ANPmRNA level in the left ventricular aneurysm showed about a 10-fold increase compared with that in the normal heart and reached 23% of that in the atrium of the same heart. A similar increase in the ANPmRNA level was observed in the entire ventricle of DCM. These data clearly indicate that the expression of the ANP gene in the ventricle is augmented in the failing heart in accordance with the severity of heart failure. In the atrium of the failing heart, ANP and ANPmRNA levels were only two times higher than those in the normal atrium. Thus, the augmentation in the expression of the ANP gene was more prominent in the ventricle than in the atrium. Taking tissue weight into account, the total content of ANPmRNA in the ventricle of the failing heart is much the same as that in the normal atrium. The ratio of the ANP level to the ANPmRNA level in the ventricle is much smaller than that in the atrium. These results suggest more rapid secretion of ANP after synthesis in the ventricle. These findings demonstrate that the expression of the ANP gene is augmented in the human ventricle of the failing heart and suggest that the ventricle becomes a substantial source of circulating ANP in congestive heart failure.\r"

Plasma ANP levels in Ao, AIV, GCV, and CS were 454 +/- 360, 915 +/- 584, 1,308 +/- 926, and 1,884 +/- 1,194 pg/ml, respectively, in the patients with DCM and 108 +/- 42, 127 +/- 55, 461 +/- 224, and 682 +/- 341 pg/ml, respectively, in the control subjects. There was no significant difference in the plasma ANP levels between Ao and AIV in the control subjects. On the contrary, there was a significant (P less than 0.001) step-up in plasma ANP levels between Ao and AIV in patients with DCM. Thus, the difference in ANP levels between Ao and AIV was significantly increased in patients with DCM as compared with the control subjects (461 +/- 248 vs. 19 +/- 59 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). The difference in ANP levels between Ao and CS was also significantly increased in patients with DCM as compared with the control subjects (1,429 +/- 890 vs. 577 +/- 318 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). We conclude that ANP is released in increased amounts into the circulation from the left ventricle as well as from the heart as a whole in patients with DCM.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]f) were examined in freshly immunodissected rabbit cortical collecting tubule cells using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators fura-2 and indo-1. The addition of AVP to a cell suspension resulted in a rapid and transient increase in the [Ca2+]f. The 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (dDVP), a V2 receptor agonist of AVP that stimulated adenosine 3',5' cAMP production in these cells, had no effect on [Ca2+]f and did not affect AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]f. The AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]f but not cAMP production was blocked by the V1 receptor antagonist, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta-beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine] Arg8-vasopressin. The AVP-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]f appeared to be largely due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores as reduction of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA had little if any effect on the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]f. This AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]f was associated with an increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production and appeared to involve a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G), since the pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin for 4-6 h inhibited this effect. Finally, measurements of [Ca2+]f in single cells suggest that only the principal cells of the collecting tubules respond to AVP with an increase in [Ca2+]f. In summary, these results demonstrate that the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubule possess two distinct receptor systems for vasopressin, the well-known V2 receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase, and a V1 receptor system that leads to the mobilization of cytosolic calcium, coupled through a pertussis toxin substrate (G protein) to a production of inositol phosphates.\r"

Secondary to altered PKC activity, other cellular enzymes such as (Na,K)-ATPase could be affected. To test this hypothesis we examined the association between PKC activity, (Na,K)-ATPase activity, and sorbitol, myoinositol, and InsP levels in cultured bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells, a cell type prominently involved in diabetic retinopathy. Elevating glucose concentration in culture media from 100 to 400 mg/dl led to a 100% increase in sorbitol levels, which could be inhibited completely by sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor. In contrast, no changes were observed in myoinositol or InsP levels. Subfractionated PKC activities showed a 100% increase in the membranous pool with a parallel decrease in the cytosolic fraction. Adding sorbinil did not affect PKC activity, whereas the PKC agonist, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), stimulated translocation of PKC. Ouabain-inhibitable (Na,K)-ATPase activity was decreased 70% by elevated glucose levels. This decrease could be prevented by adding either PMA or sorbinil. Thus, in retinal capillary endothelial cells elevated glucose concentration can affect PKC and (Na,K)-ATPase activities, probably via different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "TCR-mediated granule exocytosis, as measured by the release of serine esterase activity, has been implicated in the lytic process of Ag-specific CTL. Exocytosis appears to be the mechanism of release of other lysis-relevant molecules including cytotoxic lymphokines and proteins that have the capacity to induce membrane lesions as measured by the hemolysis of non-nucleated SRBC. In the studies presented here, we assessed the contribution of exocytosis and lymphokine production in CTL lysis of nucleated and non-nucleated target cells by using a panel of murine CTL clones. Ag-mediated activation of cytolysis, lymphokine production, and exocytosis could be mimicked by mAb against the TCR/CD3 complex, or by stimulation with the combination of PMA + calcium ionophore, which appear to bypass the TCR (neither PMA nor calcium ionophore alone induced these functions efficiently in our CD8+ CTL clones). Although lysis, IFN-gamma production and exocytosis of N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysin esterase (BLTE) activity were induced by either stimulus, we were able to identify distinct activation requirements for each of these functions. We found that lymphokine production, exocytosis, and cytolysis could be selectively inhibited. Cycloheximide inhibited IFN-gamma production, but did not inhibit exocytosis of BLTE activity or cytolysis. In addition we showed that cyclosporine A (CsA) profoundly inhibited IFN-gamma production as well as exocytosis induced by stimulation through the Ag receptor or by PMA + calcium ionophore. In contrast, CsA had little or no effect on lysis of nucleated target cells that bear the relevant Ag. These findings indicate that our CTL clones can lyse target cells by a mechanism independent of exocytosis or (de novo) lymphokine production. To directly assess the capacity of our CTL clones to lyse target cells without inducing nuclear damage we developed a system of coating non-nucleated SRBC with anti-CD3 mAb for use as stimuli and as targets for lysis. We found that our cloned CTL were indeed activated to produce IFN-gamma by SRBC that were coated with anti-CD3 mAb, and, furthermore, they were able to lyse the SRBC in a short term cytolytic assay. Thus our CD8+ CTL are capable of lysing certain target cells by a mechanism independent of DNA degradation, presumably by inducing a membrane lesion. In addition, CsA did inhibit lysis of the non-nucleated SRBC targets as well as exocytosis of BLTE activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The human cell surface protein CD4 is not only an important accessory molecule in the activation of MHC class-II-restricted T cells, but has also been implicated to be a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-I on lymphoid and monocytic cells. We have found that a 24-h treatment of the promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 with rIFN-gamma decreases the expression of the CD4 Ag by 50% as measured by cytofluorographic analysis. The decrease in CD4 expression was dependent on the concentration of rIFN-gamma, with maximal effects occurring at 20 to 200 U/ml. The decrease appeared to be due to actual loss of the CD4 molecule from the cell surface rather than masking of a particular epitope, inasmuch as similar results were obtained with the OKT4 and OKT4A antibodies. The effect of rIFN-gamma to decrease CD4 expression was not due to a general loss of cell surface Ag, because the binding of OKM1 and anti-HLe-1 increased after rIFN-gamma treatment. Treatment of rIFN-gamma also decreased cell surface CD4 expression on the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and on the monocytic cell line THP-1, although the extent of the decrease was less than on U937 cells. Freshly isolated normal peripheral blood monocytes treated for 48 h with rIFN-gamma bound much less OKT4 or OKT4A antibody than cells incubated in the absence of rIFN-gamma. Moreover, treatment with rIFN-gamma reduced the percentage of peripheral blood monocytes that were positive for the CD4 Ag. In contrast with the decrease in CD4 levels on rIFN-gamma-treated monocytes, treatment with rIFN-gamma had no effect on CD4 levels on peripheral blood T lymphocytes or T cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "IL-4 was originally described on the basis of its ability to co-stimulate the proliferation of resting B cells treated with anti-IgM. Recently, this cytokine has been shown to have other effects on mast cells, T cells, B cells, and macrophages. We studied the ability of IL-4 to regulate the production of C2 by human monocytes and monocytic cell lines and compared this with stimulation of HLA-DR expression, another recently described activity of IL-4. Responses to IL-4 were compared to IFN-gamma, a cytokine with both activities. IL-4 up-regulated C2 production by human monocytes and this effect was not inhibited by neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibody. IL-4 also stimulated C2 production by HL-60 cells that had been pre-treated with vitamin D3 to induce monocytic differentiation. IL-4 did not stimulate C2 production by U937 cells. IFN-gamma, in contrast to IL-4, stimulates C2 production by all three cell types. Although IL-4 increased C2 production by HL-60 cells we could not detect C2 mRNA by Northern blotting. However, co-stimulation of these cells with IL-4 and low concentrations of IFN-gamma resulted in an additive effect on C2 production and a greater increase in C2 mRNA than was seen with IFN-gamma alone. As reported by others, IL-4-stimulated HLA-DR expression by monocytes. In contrast to our findings regarding C2 production, stimulation of HLA-DR expression was inhibited by neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma mAb and IL-4 did not stimulate HLA-DR expression by U937 or HL-60 cells. IFN-gamma stimulated HLA-DR expression by all three cell types. These results identify IL-4 as an additional cytokine able to directly stimulate C2 production by human monocytes and by a monocytic cell line whereas IL-4 stimulation of HLA-DR expression by monocytes appears to be IFN-gamma dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The idiotopic (Id) repertoire of antibody response to phosphocholine was studied in mouse strains with different IgH allotypes. The T15 idiotype-bearing (T15+) serum antibody and antibody plaque-forming cells (PFC) were characterized with four monoclonal anti-Id that recognize distinct Id determinants on T15+ antibody encoded by VH-1 (of the S107 gene family), DH FL16.1, JH-1 and Vk22 germ-line genes. We have previously shown that expression of the Id designated AB1-2 and B36-82 depends on the third hypervariable loop (D region), whereas the other Id, MaId5-4 and B24-44, are influenced by VH structures outside of the D region. All four Id were expressed in the PC-response of all mouse strains tested, except the Ighj strains (C3H/HeJ, CBA/H-T6, PL/j), where the D region-dependent Id, AB1-2 and B36-82, were absent. The other Id, however, were normally expressed on individual PFC as well as the serum antibody of the Ighj strains. Expression of AB1-2 and B36-82 on 50% of PFC occurred in (BALB/c-Igha x C3H/HeJ-Ighj)F1 mice. The absence of Id correlated with a unique RFLP of the S107 gene family in Ighj strains. Finally, Id expression segregated with the appropriate RFLP pattern in individual (BALB/c x C3H/HeJ)F2 mice. These data demonstrate a selective genetic linkage of discrete T15 Id determinants, AB1-2 and B36-82 with the Igh allotype. By comparing these results with the available Ig sequences, we suggest that the Ighj allotype may be associated with an allelic form of the DH-FL16.1 segment which with VH-1, JH-1, and the Vk 22 code for the phosphocholine-specific antibody in the mouse.\r"

  ".W": "As peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) differentiate into tissue macrophages, they undergo a variety of functional changes. One such difference which has been described is an enhanced metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway in alveolar macrophages (AM) as compared to PBM. In order to elucidate a possible mechanism for this difference, we compared the metabolism of endogenously released AA mobilized by agonists and of exogenously supplied fatty acid in adherent autologous PBM and AM obtained from six normal subjects. Exogenous AA was metabolized to larger amounts of both cyclooxygenase (CO) and 5-LO products by PBM as compared with AM. Although the two cell types released similar amounts of endogenous AA in response to ionophore A23187, marked differences in the pattern of its metabolism were observed. In PBM, a large proportion of released AA remained unmetabolized, and that which was metabolized was converted predominantly to CO products. In contrast, arachidonate released by AM was efficiently metabolized, predominantly via the 5-LO pathway. Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with the particulate zymosan, with PBM synthesizing mainly CO and AM, mainly 5-LO eicosanoids. In addition, culture of PBM for up to 5 days in an aerobic environment did not alter their response to A23187 stimulation. These results suggest that the lesser 5-LO metabolism by PBM than AM is not explained by lesser phospholipase or 5-LO activities, but rather a compartmentalization of the endogenous AA deacylated by phospholipase and the 5-LO enzyme in the PBM. The acquisition of the capacity to metabolize endogenous AA to large quantities of 5-LO products as mononuclear phagocytes differentiate in the lung may equip them with the ability to mount an inflammatory response in the alveolar space.\r"

The PMA-stimulated proliferation of our CTL clones (which do not make IL-2 mRNA or protein) occurs independently of IL-2 and is not accompanied by lymphokine release. We now report, however, that protein kinase C (PKC) translocation is induced by PMA in CTL clones as well as in Th clones, which lack a proliferative response to PMA. These results suggest that PKC translocation itself is not a sufficient regulatory mechanism to account for cloned T cell proliferation. Moreover, IL-2 did not induce PKC translocation in a CTL clone, which proliferates when stimulated with IL-2. Thus, PKC translocation may not be necessary for activation of CTL proliferation. Nonetheless, cellular PKC activity appears to be required for the proliferative response of T cell clones after stimulation by PMA/PMA + calcium ionophore (A23187) or by triggering through the TCR: chronic PMA treatment, which depletes intracellular PKC activity, abrogates the proliferative response of T cell clones stimulated by PMA/PMA + A23187 or triggered through the TCR. T cell clones depleted of PKC activity, however, retain the ability to proliferate when challenged with IL-2. Murine T cell clones, therefore, possess PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways of proliferation that are not regulated by PKC translocation alone.\r"

That the lymphatic endothelial cells may be important in this inflammatory process was shown by the ability of supernatants generated from filarial Ag-driven PBMC of individuals with filarial elephantiasis caused by W. bancrofti infection to up-regulate class I MHC expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells when compared to unstimulated control supernatants from the same individual (relative fluorescence intensity = 159% +/- 13.5; p less than 0.001). In contrast, individuals with the same filarial infection but manifesting no lymphatic disease were unable to generate, in response to filarial Ag the cytokines required for this activation (relative fluorescence intensity = 93% +/- 2.6). Supernatants induced by a non-filarial Ag (purified protein derivative) were able to effect class I MHC up-regulation in both patient groups. The same filarial Ag-driven supernatants did not cause detectable class II MHC staining on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results suggest a likely role for parasite Ag-driven, cytokine-mediated endothelial cell activation in the pathogenesis of lymphatic inflammatory/obstructive filarial disease.\r"

  ".W": "A significant proportion of monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) from patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia express a KIIIa L chain-associated cross-reactive idiotype, termed 6B6.6. Previously, we reported the isolation from a patient with a monoclonal RF of a Vk gene, termed Humkv328, whose deduced amino acid sequence differs by three and seven residues from the L chains of the 6B6.6-positive RF Les and Pom, respectively. To further delineate the genetic basis of the 6B6.6 cross-reactive idiotype, we isolated from the same patient another Vk gene, termed Humkv329, which differs from kv328 by only three bases over a stretch of 1331 nucleotides sequenced. However, kv329 has a stop codon at amino acid position 94, and is thus a pseudogene. Therefore, we screened a second genomic library from an unrelated individual and isolated two potential function Vk genes (i.e., Humkv328h2 and Humkv328h5) which are highly homologous to Humkv328. All three potential functional Vk genes differ from each other by one to six bases over a 1331-bp stretch and all encode the same Vk region amino acid sequence. Among the six bases by which Humkv328h5 differs from Humkv328, two are in the conserved pentadecanucleotide region, which is known to be important in the regulation of k L chain transcription. In the future it will be important to ascertain the potential association of polymorphisms in the conserved pentadecanucleotide region with RF associated autoimmune and lymphoproliferative diseases.\r"

Neither molecule inhibits in vitro proliferation of CE-2 cells. Administration at the tumor challenge site for 10 days of daily injections of 50 micrograms of peptide 163-171 induce a consistent, although limited, inhibition of tumor growth, whereas similar injections of 1 pg of IL-1 beta induced a more marked LATI. However, strong LATI was elicited when these injections were performed in mice challenged with tumor cells admixed at 1/10 cell ratio with nonreactive lymphocytes from CE-2-bearing mice. The L3T4+ lymphocyte subset is mainly responsible for this enhancement. This reaction is abolished when recipient mice are sub-lethally irradiated, treated with cyclosporin A, or when the reactivity of L3T4+ and asialo GM1+ cells is suppressed. A similarly efficient LATI is found on combining the daily peptide injections with that of 10 U of IL-2. LATI stemming from this association, too, is abolished when mice are irradiated or treated with anti-L3T4 antibody, whereas it is not affected by cyclosporin A or anti-asialo GM1 antibody. Finally, a tumor-specific immune memory is acquired by about 50% of mice after LATI induced by IL-1 beta or 163-171 peptide alone and by about 80% of mice after LATI induced by peptide and lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice or peptide and IL-2. These findings could lead to the building of a molecularly defined system to induce efficient immune recognition of tumor cells by using a peptide that does not cause any of the several inflammation-associated changes induced by the whole IL-1 beta.\r"

One millimolar ATP did not speed the binding of 67Ga or indium-111 (111In) to HoFE. ATP and pyrophosphate (PPi) at 1 mM, did not form high affinity complexes with 67Ga or 111In. ATP and PPi interacted directly with the [67Ga]TF complex and could within minutes increase the amount of nonprotein-bound 67Ga. Serum HCO3- concentration, 30 mM, prevented the ATP-induced dissociation of 67Ga from TF, whereas intracellular concentrations (0.4 and 5 mM) did not. Using a dialysis technique, ATP also stimulated the translocation of 111In from TF to HoFE; however, this process was much slower than with 67Ga. ATP caused an increase in the nonprotein-bound 111In compared to the control. These results suggest the formation of nonprotein-bound nuclide by these phosphate-containing compounds in a kinetically labile form is important to the translocation mechanism.\r"

Maximal SAA level was detected 3-4 days after onset of the event, and reached 216 +/- 41 SEM gm/ml (normal range less than 2 gm/ml), while maximal CPK level was detected on the same day and reached 530 +/- 242 SEM IU/L (normal range 24-195 IU/L). Fibrinogen, leucocytes, platelets, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and calcium (Ca) each showed its own typical pattern of change. Fever did not develop. Comparison of SAA levels after various acute events suggests that damage to the myocardium is the most powerful stimulus for SAA induction, followed by traumatic events, arthritis, viral infections, and malignant diseases. It seems therefore that although acute response is considered a generalized reaction, it is not completely independent of the localized events which induce it. Among the known parameters, SAA is the most sensitive marker for monitoring the intensity of events.\r"

Careful planning, organization, and coordination of the blood bank and other clinical services are necessary. In our first 100 orthotopic liver transplantations, our median intraoperative erythrocyte use was 12.6 units, and 30% of the erythrocytes were provided by intraoperative cell salvage. Thus, the need for homologous blood and the number of donors to whom recipients were exposed were reduced. Use of intraoperative cell salvage and expansion of our erythrocyte inventory through the use of AS-1 preservative helped us meet the demands of the liver transplant program without compromising the availability of blood products for all other surgical and medical patients.\r"

Our nutritional assessment data indicated that malnutrition was present preoperatively in all liver transplantation groups but that each group had distinct characteristics. The group with primary biliary cirrhosis seemed to have the best hepatic synthetic function despite extreme wasting of muscle and fat. On the basis of all criteria, the group with acute hepatitis was the most malnourished of the various disease groups. Aggressive nutritional support, which includes adequate intake of nutrients and supplementation of vitamins and trace minerals, should be encouraged for all potential liver transplant patients.\r"

Our proposal would create a framework that would encourage the efficient organization of care. Successful organizations would probably be those that attracted the loyalty and commitment of physicians, integrated insurance and the provision of care, and aligned the interests of doctors and patients toward high-quality, cost-effective care. The proposal's chief potential disadvantage would be its effect on the employment opportunities of low-wage workers, but this effect could be minimized. In addition, we discuss a proposal to mandate coverage by employers of full-time employees, legislation enacted recently in Massachusetts, high-risk pools, and the system followed in Canada, comparing each of these alternatives with our proposal.\r"

In the macaque monkey, the neurons projecting through the callosum are largely restricted to area 18 throughout ontogeny, whereas area 17 is characterized by few or no callosal projections. Here, we show that suppressing the peripheral input by prenatal removal of the eyes leads to a marked reduction in the extent of area 17, resulting in a large shift in the position of the histologically identifiable boundary between the two areas. Even so, the boundary continues to separate an area rich with callosal connections (area 18) from one poor in such projections (area 17), indicating there is no effect on the callosal connectivity of area 17. In contrast, in area 18, eye removal results in many more neurons with callosal projections than in normal animals. The results suggest that the factors that determine the parcellation of cortical areas also specify their connectivity.\r"

There is now a lot of evidence that the complexes between isolated class II MHC molecules and selected peptides have long half-lives of approximately one day. The reported equilibrium binding constants between antigenic peptides and class II MHC molecules however, are only micromolar, suggesting that the association rate constants are very low. The only reported association rate constant is for a chicken ovalbumin peptide (OVA323-339) binding to I-Ad, and is indeed remarkably low, about 1 litre per mole per second. Prompted by these unusual data, we have used the pigeon cytochrome-c peptide pCytc(88-104) and I-E reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers on glass slides to investigate further the kinetics of peptide-MHC reactions. We report the formation of two IEk-pCytc peptide complexes. One complex has slow apparent association and dissociation kinetics, very similar to those reported previously for the chicken ovalbumin peptide and I-Ad. The second complex forms and dissociates about a hundred times more rapidly. The short-lived complex shows peptide-MHC specificity and is a kinetic intermediate in the formation of the long-lived complex; the long-lived complex is recognized by specific T-helper cells.\r"

The proximal promoter is active primarily in first to early third-instar larvae, whereas the distal promoter is active in late third-instar larvae and adults. The Adh larval enhancer and the proximal promoter are separated by the Adh adult enhancer and the distal promoter. Because the proximal promoter is turned off just as the distal promoter is turned on, we considered the possibility that the distal promoter or adult enhancer has a role in the downregulation of the proximal promoter. We report here that transcription from the distal promoter is required to shut off the proximal promoter. In the absence of the distal promoter, the proximal promoter is active throughout larval development and in adults. The proximal promoter is also aberrantly active in adults when placed upstream of the distal promoter. These results suggest that the developmental switch from proximal to distal promoter is regulated by the stage-specific activation of the distal promoter, and the subsequent repression of the proximal promoter by transcriptional interference.\r"

The hydrogen-uptake activity was localized predominantly in a particulate fraction, was reversibly inhibited by O2, and coupled H2 uptake to the reduction of positive potential artificial electron acceptors. Comparisons between these results and those of the well-studied hydrogen-uptake hydrogenase from the mesophile Bradyrhizobium japonicum showed the two enzymes to be similar despite the very different natural environments of the organisms. However, the optimum temperature for activity differed greatly in the two organisms. We have also used immunological and genetic probes specific to the 65-kDa subunit of B. japonicum hydrogenase to assay crude extracts and genomic DNA, respectively, from P. brockii and found the enzymes to be similar in these respects as well. In addition, we report a formulation for artificial seawater capable of sustaining the growth of P. brockii.\r"

  ".W": "Muscarinic stimulation of fluid secretion by mammalian salivary acinar cells is associated with a rise in the level of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and activation of a calcium-sensitive potassium (K+) conductance in the basolateral membrane. To test in the intact cell whether the rise of [Ca2+]i precedes activation of the K+ conductance (as expected if Ca2+ is the intracellular messenger mediating this response), [Ca2+]i and membrane voltage were measured simultaneously in carbachol-stimulated rat parotid acinar cells by using fura-2 and an intracellular microelectrode. Unexpectedly, the cells hyperpolarize (indicating activation of the K+ conductance) before fura-2 detectable [Ca2+]i begins to rise. This occurs even in Ca2+-depleted medium where intracellular stores are the only source of mobilized Ca2+. Nevertheless, when the increase in [Ca2+]i was eliminated by loading cells with the Ca2+ chelator bis(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (Me2BAPTA) and stimulating in Ca2+-depleted medium, membrane hyperpolarization was also eliminated, indicating that a rise of [Ca2+] is required for the agonist-induced voltage response. Stimulation of Me2BAPTA-loaded cells in Ca2+-containing medium dramatically accentuates the temporal dissociation between the activation of the K+ conductance and the rise of [Ca2+]i. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that muscarinic stimulation results in a rapid localized increase in [Ca2+]i at the acinar basolateral membrane followed by a somewhat delayed increase in total [Ca2+]i. The localized increase cannot be detected by fura-2 but is sufficient to open the Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels located in the basolateral membrane. We concluded that a receptor-mobilized intracellular store of Ca2+ is localized at or near the basolateral membrane.\r"

The largest of the major oligosaccharides (Mr, 2122) consists of 3-deoxymanno-2-ketooctulosonic acid (KDO)-Hep2GalNAcGlcNAcGal4Glc2 (Hep, heptose) and phosphoethanolamine (PEA). The smaller oligosaccharides are truncated versions of this larger oligosaccharide.

A hexose (Hex)2-3 branch is attached to the heptose linked directly to KDO and a GalNAc-Hex3, GlcNAc, and PEA are separately attached to the second heptose. These oligosaccharides are the first structures to be determined for a gonococcal LPS and should further our understanding of the structural and antigenic diversity of these glycolipids.\r"

GA is one of the \"Finnish genetic diseases,\" a group of several rare monogenic disorders that occur with increased frequency in the Finnish population. Using a combination of RNase A protection, genomic cloning, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA, we found one of two missense mutant OAT alleles to be present in each of 16 Finnish GA pedigrees. The first mutation R180T, in which arginine-180 is replaced by threonine, was present in homozygous form in patients from two pedigrees. The second mutation L402P, in which leucine-402 is replaced by proline, was present in homozygous form in patients from 14 pedigrees. Neither mutation was present in 19 Finnish controls. L402P was not present in 18 non-Finnish GA patients but R180T was found in an American GA patient. We constructed full-length mutant cDNAs by amplifying patient cDNA with the polymerase chain reaction and cloning a restriction fragment containing the mutation into an otherwise normal human OAT cDNA. These mutant cDNAs were then expressed in CHO-K1 cells, which lack endogenous OAT. Both R180T and L402P inactivate OAT. These results show molecular heterogeneity in GA alleles even in the Finnish population.\r"

The transfectants present an idiotope of the lambda 2(315) light chain to class II-restricted T-cell clones. Recognition by the T cells requires processing of the lambda 2(315) light chain. From these data we conclude that B-lymphoma cells constitutively process and present their immunoglobulins. Secretion and reuptake of the light chain was not necessary for the presentation. Thus, B cells bear two types of idiotypes on their membrane, a native form as surface immunoglobulin and a processed form in the context of products of the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

  ".W": "Adjuvant arthritis in rats is a T-cell dependent \"autoimmune\" disease with close similarities to several forms of human arthritis. Injection of mycobacterial adjuvant leads to T-cell activation and proliferation, processes in which the de novo expression of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor plays a pivotal role. The subsequent massive mononuclear cell infiltration of the joints ultimately results in complete joint destruction. Because activation of the helper/inducer subset of T lymphocytes is critical to the establishment of disease, we reasoned that IL2-PE40, a cytotoxic IL-2-Pseudomonas exotoxin fusion protein that targets the membrane-penetration and ADP-ribosylation domains of the toxin to cells bearing the IL-2 receptor, would be an effective and specific therapy. Adjuvant-injected rats were randomized to treatment with IL2-PE40, phosphate-buffered saline, or either of two control proteins related to IL2-PE40 but lacking either the receptor-binding moiety or an enzymatically active toxin domain and previously demonstrated to lack cytotoxicity in vitro. Intraperitoneal IL2-PE40 given before the establishment of overt clinical disease proved an effective and specific modifier of adjuvant arthritis by clinical, histological, and radiographic criteria. Our data suggest that IL2-PE40 may be effective in those diseases in which activated T-cells play an important role.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have implicated proteases, acting extracellularly, in the mechanism of polyneuronal synapse elimination. Most studies have focused on mammalian, especially rodent, skeletal muscle, where retraction of subordinate nerve terminals occurs during a narrow time window 2-3 weeks after birth. To date no specific protease(s) has been detected that (i) coincides in time with maximal synapse elimination and (ii) is known to act extracellularly on specific extracellular matrix proteins. In previous studies of denervation in adult mouse muscle, rapid activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a neutral serine protease, was detected. This enzyme, by activation of plasminogen to plasmin, specifically degrades matrix components such as fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin in muscle. We now present evidence for an initial increase and subsequent decrease in soluble urokinase-type PA--and, to a lesser extent, tissue PA--in developing muscle, suggesting postnatal developmental regulation of these enzymes during the period of maximal synapse elimination. Although considerably higher in specific activity, membrane-bound PA activity followed the wave of synapse elimination, possibly indicating a longer half-life of membrane-bound enzyme(s).\r"

The complete exon/intron organization and nucleotide sequence of the rat NGFI-A gene have been determined. The gene spans 3789 nucleotides (nt) and is interrupted by a single intron at nt 588. All three zinc-finger DNA-binding domains are contiguously coded for within the 3' exon; this is in contrast to the structure described by others for the Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA gene. To analyze the transcription of this gene, we have determined the transcription start site and nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region. Transfection of PC12 cells with a fragment from the 5' flanking region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene revealed that it contains an element which imparts an NGF-inducible phenotype to the normally silent CAT gene. Several regions with homologies to recognizable sequence elements are present in this fragment, including a TATA box at nt -27, serum response elements at nt -84, -106, -370, and -408, a cAMP-responsive element at nt -140, and a transcription factor Sp1-binding site at nt -286. These results establish the genomic structure of this mammalian multifinger protein and demonstrate that an NGF-responsive element lies upstream of the NGFI-A gene.\r"

This highly purified Tetrahymena actin shares many essential properties with ubiquitous actin, including ion-dependent polymerization to microfilaments, binding with muscle heavy meromyosin to form arrowheads, and activation of the Mg2+-ATPase of muscle myosin subfragment 1. On the other hand, some properties of this purified Tetrahymena actin clearly differ from those of muscle actin: (i) Tetrahymena actin has 8 times less ability to activate the Mg2+-ATPase of muscle myosin subfragment 1 than muscle actin; (ii) Tetrahymena actin did not bind to phalloidin at all; (iii) Tetrahymena actin did not inhibit DNase I activity at all. In general, Tetrahymena actin has very unusual properties when compared to other actins described so far. This actin is expected to provide important clues for elucidating problems concerning the relationships between the structural and functional domains in an actin molecule.\r"

From the sequence we predict three open reading frames corresponding to frzA, frzB, and frzCD. The putative FrzA protein (17,094 Da) exhibits 28.1% amino acid identity with the CheW protein of Salmonella typhimurium. The putative FrzCD protein (43,571 Da) contains a region of about 250 amino acids which is similar to the C-terminal portions of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptor proteins of the enteric bacteria. FrzCD also contains a region with potentially significant similarity to the DNA-binding region of the Bacillus subtilis sigma 43. The putative FrzB protein (12,066 Da) shares no significant identity with known chemotaxis proteins. The sequence similarities between the putative Frz proteins and the chemotaxis proteins of the enteric bacteria strongly support the hypothesis that the frz genes define a system of signal transduction analogous to the enterobacterial chemotaxis systems.\r"

The first epidermal growth factor-like domain in factor IX (residues 45-87) was synthesized with aspartic acid in position 64, replacing 3-hydroxyaspartic acid. It was used as substrate in a hydroxylase assay with rat liver microsomes as the source of enzyme and reaction conditions that satisfy the requirements of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The synthetic peptide stimulated the 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation in contrast to synthetic, modified epidermal growth factor (Met-21 and His-22 deleted and Glu-24 replaced by Asp) and synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 60-71 in human factor IX. This indicates that the hydroxylase is a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase with a selective substrate requirement.\r"

Evidence was obtained using activation of AFB1 as monitored by umuC gene expression response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 and enzyme reconstitution, immunochemical inhibition, correlation of response with levels of P-450NF and nifedipine oxidase activity in different liver samples, stimulation of activity by 7,8-benzoflavone, and inhibition of activity by troleandomycin. Similar results were obtained when levels of 2,3-dihydro-2-(N7-guanyl)-3-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 formed in DNA were measured. P-450NF or a closely related protein also appears to be the major catalyst involved in the activation of aflatoxin G1 and sterigmatocystin, the latter compound being more genotoxic than AFB1 in these systems. Several drugs and conditions are known to influence the levels and activity of P-450NF in human liver, and the activity of the enzyme can be estimated by noninvasive assays. These findings provide a test system for the hypothesis that a specific human disease state (liver cancer) is linked to the level of oxidative metabolism in populations in which aflatoxin ingestion is high.\r"

We have identified the factors interacting with this region as 42- and 45-kDa proteins by DNA affinity chromatography, immunoblotting, and UV crosslinking. These proteins, which are candidates for conferring high-level expression to the histone promoter, share an antigenic epitope with the DNA-binding domain of Jun but diverge from it at the amino terminus. The interaction of these proteins with the promoter of a replication-dependent cellular gene provides evidence that members of the Jun oncoprotein family may play specific roles in the expression of genes essential for progression of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".U": "89098966\r", 
  ".W": "Endosomes maintain a slightly acidic internal pH, which is directly responsible for their ability to ensure proper sorting of incoming receptors and ligands during endocytosis. At least two distinct subpopulations of endosomes can be distinguished, designated \"early\" and \"late\" on the basis of their kinetics of labeling with endocytic tracers. The subpopulations differ not only in their functions (rapid receptor recycling and transport to lysosomes, respectively) but also in their capacities for acidification in intact cells and in vitro. To investigate the possible basis for pH regulation in endosomes, we have studied the transport properties and ion permeabilities of early and late endosomes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells. Using endosomes selectively labeled with pH-sensitive endocytic tracers, we found that ATP-dependent acidification is electrogenic, being accompanied by the generation of an interior-positive membrane potential which opposes further acidification. While membrane potential and, consequently, acidification was controlled by the influx of permeant anions and efflux of protons and alkali cations, acidification was further modulated in Na+ and K+-containing buffers by the ouabain- and vanadate-sensitive Na+,K+-ATPase, which appears to be a functional component of the endosomal membrane. The data suggest that electrogenic Na+ transport due to Na+,K+-ATPase activity contributes to the interior-positive membrane potential, thereby reducing ATP-dependent H+ transport. Importantly, inhibition of acidification by Na+,K+-ATPase activity was found only in early endosomes, consistent with their limited acidification capacity relative to late endosomes and lysosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Acidification of endocytosed ligands destined for lysosomes is biphasic, with a rapid drop to pH 6, followed by a slow decrease to pH 5. Continuous measurements of transferrin acidification have confirmed that the pH minimum in early (presorting) endosomes is approximately pH 6. On the basis of measurements of endosomal acidification in vitro, it has been proposed that the pH in the early endosome is limited by the internalization of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which generates an interior-positive membrane potential in this compartment [Fuchs, R., Schmid, S. & Mellman, I. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 539-543]. We present two lines of evidence that strongly implicate the Na+,K+-ATPase as a major regulatory element of endocytic pH in vivo. First, ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na+,K+-ATPase, interferes with the regulation of acidification in early endocytic compartments. Transferrin is normally rapidly acidified to pH 6.0-6.2, followed by alkalinization during recycling. In the presence of ouabain, the minimum pH of transferrin-containing endosomes decreases from 6.0-6.2 to less than 5.3. Second, ouabain eliminates the resistance to both the growth inhibitory and vacuologenic effects of chloroquine in the lysosomal acidification defective cell line CHL60-64. The phenotype of this cell line is consistent with a defect in the removal or inactivation of the early acidification regulatory elements from the late endocytic compartments. The ouabain data suggest that the defect in this cell line is due to improper localization of the Na+,K+-ATPase. A model for pH regulation and vacuolation by weak bases is discussed.\r"

Cured mice were found to be immune upon rechallenge with the same P. berghei strain 4 months after the initial infection and drug-induced cure. MDL 27695 rapidly inhibited the incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine into P. falciparum RNA and DNA, whereas the incorporation of [3H]isoleucine was not affected until much later. We conclude, therefore, that the major cytotoxic event may be direct binding of MDL 27695 to DNA with subsequent disruption of macromolecular biosynthesis and cell death.

Production was detected by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA assay in blood mononuclear cells in 54% of asymptomatic, 71% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, and 100% of AIDS patients. When the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated into monocytes and CD4+ T cells, we found that the CD4+ T-cell fraction was preferentially infected in the three clinical stages. The ability to isolate HIV from blood monocyte-derived macrophages was similar in the three stages (24-33%) and required coculture with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. Bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells cultured simultaneously yielded virus from both sources in 13 individuals. Again the prime source of virus was the nonadherent bone marrow mononuclear cells, which contained CD4+ T cells, and not the adherent monocyte-enriched fraction. We conclude that blood mononuclear cells yield productive virus more readily as disease progresses and that infection is detected in association with CD4+ T-cell-enriched fractions. In our large sample of patients, monocyte infection was detected in only a small fraction, suggesting that this cell type is neither a primary nor an exclusive reservoir of HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Mild to moderate lead toxicity (blood lead, 25-55 micrograms/dl) is a preventable pediatric illness affecting several million preschool children (\"lead-toxic children\") in the United States. In-hospital lead-chelation treatment is predicated upon a positive CaNa2EDTA test, which is difficult to perform and impractical in large populations. After the development of an L-line x-ray fluorescence technique (LXRF) that measures cortical bone lead content safely, rapidly, and noninvasively, this study was initiated in lead-toxic children to compare LXRF with the CaNa2EDTA test. Moreover, LXRF provided the opportunity to quantify bone lead content. From blood lead and LXRF alone, 90% of lead-toxic children were correctly classified as being CaNa2EDTA-positive or -negative. In 76% of 59 lead-toxic children, bone lead values measured by LXRF were equal to or greater than those measured in normal and industrially exposed adults. These results indicate that LXRF may be capable of replacing the CaNa2EDTA test. When considered with the known neurotoxic effects on children of \"low levels\" of exposure to lead, these results also suggest that either an excessively narrow margin of safety or insufficient safety is provided by present U.S. guidelines, which classify an elevated blood lead concentration as 25 micrograms/dl or greater.\r"

  ".W": "We measured the spatial-frequency tuning of cells at regular intervals along tangential probes through the monkey striate cortex and correlated the recording sites with the cortical cytochrome oxidase (CytOx) patterns to address three questions with regard to the cortical spatial-frequency organization. (i) Is there a periodic anatomical arrangement of cells tuned to different spatial-frequency ranges? We found there is, because the spatial-frequency tuning of cells along tangential probes changed systematically, varying from a low frequency to a middle range to high frequencies and back again repeatedly over distances of about 0.6-0.7 mm. (ii) Are there just two populations of cells, low-frequency and high-frequency units, at a given eccentricity (perhaps corresponding to the magno- and parvocellular geniculate pathways) or is there a continuum of spatial-frequency peaks? We found a continuum of peak tuning. Most cells are tuned to intermediate spatial frequencies and form a unimodal rather than a bimodal distribution of cell peaks. Furthermore, the cells with different peak frequencies were found to be continuously and smoothly distributed across a module. (iii) What is the relation between the physiological spatial-frequency organization and the regions of high CytOx concentration (\"blobs\")? We found a systematic correlation between the topographical variation in spatial-frequency tuning and the modular CytOx pattern, which also varied continuously in density. Low-frequency cells are at the center of the blobs, and cells tuned to increasingly higher spatial frequencies are at increasing radial distances.\r"

Only the 2.0-kb fragment, however, was correlated with testis determination. Polymerase chain reaction analysis suggests both Y loci are transcribed in adult testes. A 3.6-kb fragment was mapped to the X chromosome between the T16H and T6R1 translocation breakpoints, and a fourth (6.0 kb) was mapped to chromosome 10.

The extension of these methods to large peptides and proteins, for which folding of secondary structures into functional tertiary structures is critical, is discussed. Models of apolipoproteins, the homeo domain from the developmental protein encoded by the Antennapedia gene of Drosophila, a part of the Cro repressor, and the enzyme ribonuclease T1 and a structural analog have been synthesized with this method.\r"

Before recombination, the Schwann cells or the fibroblasts were labeled by infection with a defective recombinant retrovirus whose gene product, beta-galactosidase, is histochemically detectable in the progeny of infected cells. Perineurial cells were labeled when fibroblasts had been infected but not when Schwann cells had been infected. Thus, perineurium arises from fibroblasts in vitro and, by implication, in vivo as well.\r"

To determine whether a single NGF binding protein is common to both forms of the receptor, a full-length receptor cDNA was introduced in the NR18 cell line, an NGF receptor-deficient variant of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line. The transformant displayed (i) both high and low affinity receptors detectable by receptor binding; (ii) an affinity cross-linking pattern with 125I-labeled NGF similar to that of the parent PC12 cell line; and (iii) biological responsiveness to NGF as assayed by induction of c-fos transcription. These findings support the hypothesis that a single binding protein is common to both forms of the NGF receptor and suggest that an additional protein is required to produce the high affinity form of the NGF receptor.\r"

Both ANP (10(-11) M) and dibutyryl guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (10(-4) M) inhibited the channel in cell-attached patches, and cGMP (10(-5) M) inhibited the channel in inside-out patches. The inner medullary collecting duct is the first tissue in which ANP, via its second messenger cGMP, has been shown to regulate single ion channels.

Treatment of SHRs and WKYs with stannous chloride (SnCl2), which selectively depletes renal cytochrome P-450, restored BP to normal, coincident with a natriuresis, in young but not in adult SHRs and did not affect either BP or sodium excretion in WKYs.

No hybridization to the inhibin alpha subunit was detectable in the TM3 cells. Conditioned medium from TM3 cells and from primary cultures of rat and porcine interstitial cells stimulated the release of follicle-stimulating hormone in a pituitary cell culture assay.

The spoIVCB gene is now shown to be a truncated gene capable of specifying only the amino terminal half of sigma K. The carboxyl terminal half is specified by another sporulation gene, spoIIIC, to which spoIVCB becomes joined inframe at an intermediate stage of sporulation by site-specific recombination within a 5-base pair repeated sequence. Juxtaposition of spoIVCB and spoIIIC need not be reversible in that the mother cell and its chromosome are discarded at the end of the developmental cycle. The rearrangement of chromosomal DNA could account for the presence of sigma K selectively in the mother cell and may be a precedent for the generation of cell type-specific regulatory proteins in other developmental systems where cells undergo terminal differentiation.\r"

A 14-kD protein was also discovered that changes the specificity of sigma K-containing RNA polymerase, greatly stimulating spoIVCB transcription and markedly repressing cotD transcription. Both sigma K and the 14-kD protein are products of genes known to be required for expression of specific genes in the mother cell. Thus, sigma K directs gene expression in the mother cell and it is proposed that inactivation or sequestering of the 14-kD protein switches the temporal pattern of gene expression during the transition from stages IV to V of development.\r"

Nuclear extracts from F9 cells contained an octamer binding protein (NF-A3) that was unique to EC cells; the amount of NF-A3 decreased upon differentiation.

A pancreatic cancer cell line (MIA PaCa-2) was chosen and its growth in nude mice and sensitivity to lysis by human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were characterized. This line grew in 96% of the cases when young (4- to 6-week-old) Swiss/NIH nude mice were used. The line was highly sensitive to lysis by LAK cells in a standard chromium-51 release assay (67.8%), similarly to other cell lines known to be highly sensitive, such as K562 (75.6%) and the melanoma cell line SU.102 (53.1%). To assess their in vivo distribution, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and LAK cells were adoptively transferred into nude mice after labeling with indium-111 oxine. The results of this study show that adoptively transferred PBLs and LAK cells localize in this heterologous system as they do in autologous systems. PBLs are taken up mostly by the liver and spleen. The percentage of the administered dose of radioactivity taken up corrected by weight (percent dose per gram tissue) is 64.3 +/- 15.6%d/gm (liver) and 43.5 +/- 9.5%d/gm (spleen). LAK cells are taken up by liver (43.2 +/- 5.3%d/gm) and spleen (28.0 +/- 4.9%d/gm) but also localize significantly more than PBLs in other organs such as lungs (12.9 +/- 3.5%d/gm vs 1.4 +/- 0.3%d/gm, p less than 0.01), kidneys (19.1 +/- 2.1%d/gm vs 6.3 +/- 1.5%d/gm, p less than 0.001), and pancreatic tumors growing in orthotopic position (1.93 +/- 0.36%d/gm vs 0.56 +/- 0.06%d/gm, p less than 0.05). When the nude mice are pretreated with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor, localization of LAK cells compared with PBLs is even further enhanced both in tumors implanted in the pancreas (3.1 +/- 0.5%d/gm vs 0.56 +/- 0.06%d/gm, p less than 0.01) and in the subcutis (12.5 +/- 8.3%d/gm vs 0.95 +/- 0.29%d/gm, p less than 0.001).\r"

The step (approximately 20 mm Hg) was induced by rapidly deflating thigh blood pressure cuffs following a 2-minute inflation above systolic blood pressure. Instantaneous arterial blood pressure was measured by a new servo-cuff method, and cerebral blood flow changes were assessed by transcranial Doppler recording of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity. In hypocapnia, full restoration of blood flow to the pretest level was seen as early as 4.1 seconds after the step decrease in blood pressure, while the response was slower in normocapnia and hypercapnia. The time course of cerebrovascular resistance was calculated from blood pressure and blood flow recordings, and rate of regulation was determined as the normalized change in cerebrovascular resistance per second during 2.5 seconds just after the step decrease in blood pressure. The reference for normalization was the calculated change in cerebrovascular resistance that would have nullified the effects of the step decrease in arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow. The rate of regulation was 0.38, 0.20, and 0.11/sec in hypocapnia, normocapnia, and hypercapnia, respectively. There was a highly significant inverse relation between rate of regulation and PaCO2 (p less than 0.001), indicating that the response rate of cerebral autoregulation in awake normal humans is profoundly dependent on vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "During storage, human platelet concentrates progressively lose the capacity to survive and function in vivo after transfusion. A shape transformation from disc to sphere is the most reliable in vitro determinant for the loss of the in vivo survival of platelets. To find an objective measurement for platelet morphology, we studied the effect of anticoagulant, temperature, and storage on the apparent median platelet volume (MPV) as determined by a particle counter and on changes in platelet shape as measured and by light microscopy. Changes in MPV, light transmission, and morphology score by light microscopy were observed within 1 minute after collection of blood in CPDA. As compared to blood immediately fixed on withdrawal, in CPDA blood, the MPV increased from 4.1 to 5.7 fl, and light transmission difference decreased from 22 to 7 percent. A partial restoration of these determinants was found when the whole blood was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, before preparation of platelet-rich plasma. In the first 5 days of platelet storage, the MPV increased from 4.6 to 5.0 fl; thereafter, it started to decrease. An increase in fragmented platelets after 5 days was observed on light microscopy. The light transmission difference showed a slow disc-to-sphere transformation during storage. This transformation accelerated from Day 5 to Day 7; after 11 days, only spheres were detected. After 7 days the swirling pattern scores were still in accordance with the presence of discs, whereas the other structure-associated determinants showed already spheric and even fragmented platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The transfusion of blood may suppress the immune responses of patients with renal transplants and with malignant disorders. To study the in vitro suppressive effects of banked blood, 4 units of blood were stored in CPDA-1 and ADSOL at 4 degrees C for 14 days. Lymphocytes and plasma or ADSOL supernatants were harvested on Days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14. Subpopulations of lymphocytes were enumerated by flow cytometry. Recalcified and heat-treated plasma and supernatants from the units of blood were added to mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) composed of cells from normal individuals. No significant changes were noted in the proportions of T or B cells from blood stored under these conditions. A 60 +/- 3 percent inhibition in the proliferative response was observed when plasma from CPDA-1 units was added to MLCs (p less than 0.02). Supernatants from ADSOL units demonstrated a 29 +/- 4 percent inhibition (p less than 0.10) of the proliferative response, and this inhibition of response was observed on all 14 days of the study. When appropriate concentrations of dextrose or adenine were added to other MLCs, adenine (at the concentration found in ADSOL) caused a significant inhibition of the proliferative response. This inhibition was not, however, as marked as that observed with recalcified, heat-treated plasma from CPDA-1 units. We conclude that adenine plus some additional factor(s) found in the liquid portion of stored blood inhibits the proliferative response of normal lymphocytes. It is possible that these factors contribute to the immune suppression observed in vivo in some patients who receive blood transfusions.\r"

All prior studies of postperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have employed TENS stimulators which were designed for the control of chronic pain. Disadvantages to the use of standard TENS stimulators in postoperative patients include the high cost of the devices and their operative complexity which make it difficult for staff and patients to use them. FasTENS is a lightweight, relatively inexpensive disposable TENS stimulator which has been designed specifically for use in postoperative patients. We evaluated the effectiveness of FasTENS in patients who had implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis, radical retropubic prostatectomy, or radical nephrectomy. Patients treated with FasTENS used 60 percent less pain medication (P less than 0.001) and made 61 percent fewer requests for Demerol injections (P less than 0.001) than did control patients who were not treated with postoperative electroanalgesia. FasTENS was most effective in patients who had radical prostatectomy or penile prosthetic surgery. FasTENS was not cost-effective or practical in patients who had radical nephrectomy.\r"

The remaining eight patients who had surgery all had temporal lobectomies for intractable seizures; none had tumors. In the complex partial seizure subgroup of 34 patients, MR was positive in 44%, CT was positive in 29%, and EEG was positive in 80%. We consider MR to be the imaging procedure of choice for the detection of an epileptogenic focus in seizure patients.

During ExC all patients had ischemia (angina, and ST segment alterations); metabolic markers of ischemia (MMI) increased, as did the mean pulmonary artery pressure, from 19 to 41 mm Hg. However, during ExE ischemia was abolished (no angina, decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure to 24 mm Hg, and improvement in MMI) and there was some improvement in left ventricular pump function, whereas pre- and afterload decreased (pulmonary artery pressure by 40%, systemic vascular resistance by 10%), and heart rate, arterial pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) were all unchanged (p greater than 0.05). Comparative hemodynamics at RE vs RC showed a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (by 25%) and pulmonary vascular resistance (by 19%) and an increase in heart rate (by 11%), whereas arterial pressure and MVO2 were unchanged (p greater than 0.05). Enoximone did not induce changes in plasma catecholamine, prostaglandin, or thromboxane levels (p greater than 0.05), whereas the atrial natriuretic factor decreased (by 15%), probably because of unloading of the atria during exercise. We concluded that enoximone induces beneficial hemodynamic effects in coronary artery disease without causing ischemia, probably by enhancing myocardial contractility, vasodilation, and improved diastolic properties.\r"

During the development of the RBC GSHPx deficiency, enzymatic activity and protein content decreased. Plasma and RBC selenium content were similarly decreased as was cellular metabolism of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. When the replacement of Se (selenious acid) began, there was a rapid increase (within 6 h) in plasma GSHPx activity. Platelet and granulocyte (PMN) GSHPx activity, which were low when Se replacement began, became normal within a time consistent with the kinetics of platelet and PMN production. RBC GSHPx did not become normal for 3-4 mo. This is consistent with the time course for RBC production. It appears that the repletion of blood cell GSHPx requires the formation of these cells in the presence of Se.\r"

In females 24% had Fe-deficiency anemia, 13% Fe-deficient erythropoiesis, and 16% depleted stores. Multiple regression analysis failed to show any relationship in women between age, parity, and duration of menses and measurements of Fe status.

The prevalence of Fe-deficiency anemia (IDA) decreased from 22 to 5% in fortified females. Premenopausal women, multipara women, and women with prolonged menstruation or initial IDA benefitted most from fortification. The mean increase in body Fe stores in females with initial IDA was 9.0 +/- 1.3 mmol, representing an increased absorption of 12 mumol/d. Fortified subjects with normal Fe status did not accumulate excessive body Fe and there was no alteration in serum Zn concentrations. Targeted fortification is a safe and effective means of combatting Fe deficiency.\r"

In seven of the 15 patients, elevated serum aminotransferase levels decreased rapidly during therapy and eventually fell into the normal or nearly normal range. However, once the therapy was stopped, a prompt return of aminotransferase levels to pretreatment values usually was observed. After 3 months of follow-up, aminotransferase activities remained normal in only two patients in whom liver histology showed marked improvement in intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis of hepatocytes. Anti-interferon antibody was detected in four patients at the end of therapy, and decreased 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity occurred in two patients and in another with relapsed aminotransferase level.

Buserelin treatment was discontinued only in the presence of a positive pregnancy test result. Different responses were observed between the first and subsequent cycles. Whereas estradiol production and follicular growth were closely correlated in the first attempt, we recorded a dissociation between these two parameters of ovarian response during subsequent stimulations. Four clinical pregnancies occurred in these nine patients, and there was one abortion. This therapeutic approach can be successfully used to induce ovulation; however, prolonging pituitary suppression between treatment cycles changes the type of ovarian response and is not followed by better results.\r"

The role, if any, that atrial natriuretic peptide plays in regulating these changes is unknown, and little information is available on atrial natriuretic peptide levels at different stages of gestation in the rat. In this study we measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels by radioimmunoassay in the rat at each stage of the estrous cycle, during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy, and in the early postpartum period. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels did not change during the estrous cycle. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels were low on days 10 to 15 of gestation but rose to become significantly higher than nonpregnant levels on days 16 to 18. On day 21 shortly before delivery, levels were similar to nonpregnant values. Postpartum, atrial natriuretic peptide levels rose immediately and remained elevated for the next 48 hours. These findings suggest that factors other than blood volume may mediate plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\r"

In severe preeclamptic women, the mean 24-hour values of human atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate rose significantly compared with those in normal nonpregnant and pregnant women. Also, in severe preeclamptic women, circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate, and blood pressure confirmed the same circadian rhythm with acrophase during the middle of the night. Plasma cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate values did not differ significantly among the three groups and did not confirm a circadian rhythm. These results suggest that plasma human atrial natriuretic peptide may not strongly influence blood pressure, although it may induce the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles via the cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate system in preeclampsia.\r"

Group 1 (n = 5) was infused with saline solution throughout the experiment. In group 2 (n = 5) oxytocin was infused continuously (160 microU.kg-1.min-1) for 7 days whereas group 3 (n = 5) ewes received 960 microU.kg-1.min-1 for 5 minutes every 30 minutes for 7 days. Contracture frequency increased in both oxytocin-infused groups. With continuous infusion contracture frequency returned to preinfusion levels during the last 4 days of infusion, whereas the pulsatile infusion contracture frequency remained increased throughout the infusion period. Fetal arterial PO2 was decreased throughout the 7 days of infusion in both oxytocin-infused groups. Pulsatile group fetal arterial PO2 levels remained decreased after the oxytocin infusion was stopped. These findings show: (1) Myometrial response to oxytocin in late pregnant ewes is influenced by the mode of administration; (2) administration of oxytocin to pregnant ewes resulted in a decrease in fetal PO2, and thus fetal hypoxemia cannot be attributed exclusively to increased contracture frequency.\r"

On the basis of clinical and microbiologic parameters, 29 patients (60.4%) were diagnosed as having pelvic inflammatory disease. Neisseria gonorrhoeae only was isolated from the cervix of eight (27.6%) patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, five (17.2%) had only Chlamydia, and two (6.9%) had Neisseria and Chlamydia, whereas in 15 (48.3%) patients no pathogen was isolated. Interferon-gamma was present in significantly more sera (p less than 0.025) from patients with pelvic inflammatory disease (65.5%) than from women without pelvic inflammatory disease (15.8%). Sera from 10 healthy women lacked detectable interferon-gamma. In patients with only Neisseria, seven (87.5%) had circulating interferon-gamma; three (60%) of the women with only Chlamydia, one (50%) woman with Neisseria and Chlamydia, and eight (57.1%) with no identified pathogens were also positive for interferon-gamma. Sera from 11 of 28 patients with pelvic inflammatory disease (39%) but only one of 19 sera from women without pelvic inflammatory disease (5%) also inhibited the Candida-induced proliferation of control lymphocytes. This immunosuppressive activity was prevented by immunoprecipitation of interferon-gamma by anti-interferon-gamma antibody but not by treatment with anti-interferon-alpha antibody. The persistence of interferon-gamma in the sera of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease may aid in the differential diagnosis of this disease and increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of microbial-mediated tubal damage.\r"

The incidence of movement during skin incision was compared with the frequency of spontaneous lower esophageal contractions in 20 healthy patients anesthetized with halothane. Esophageal contractility was determined using the Lectron 302, which senses the pressure in a water-filled balloon positioned in the distal esophagus. Absence of SLEC in the 6 min preceding incision correlated with no movement, with one exception (n = 9). All but one patient having greater than or equal to 2 SLEC in the 6 min preceding skin incision moved (n = 8) (P less than 0.01). Sixteen additional patients anesthetized with nitrous oxide (70%) and alfentanil demonstrated no correlation between SLEC frequency and movement. These data suggest that the frequency of spontaneous lower esophageal contractions, and its ability to predict movement, depends on anesthetic type.\r"

HPV was induced by ventilation with a hypoxic gas mixture (FIO2 at 0.095), resulting in a fall in PaO2 to 23 +/- 2 mm Hg and a rise in pulmonary vascular resistance from 285 +/- 15 to 595 +/- 30 dyne/s/cm-5. After infusion of either U-60,257B (50 mg/kg, n = 13) or BW 755c (20 mg/kg, n = 8), the responses to repeated hypoxic challenges were recorded. After U-60,257B infusion the hypoxic pressor response was eliminated at 10 and 30 min and remained significantly (p less than 0.01) attenuated at 50 min. The pulmonary pressor response to angiotensin II infusion (0.2 micrograms/kg/min) was also ablated, whereas the systemic response was unchanged. In contrast, after BW 755c infusion there was a modest but sustained augmentation of HPV, maximum at 30 min (pulmonary vascular resistance, 158 +/- 23% control, p less than 0.01), and no alteration of the responses to angiotensin II. BW 755c inhibited the A23187-induced release of leukotrienes, but not histamine, from isolated porcine lung cells (IC50, 6.3 x 10(-5) M), whereas U-60,257B inhibited the release of both leukotriene (IC50, 1.1 x 10(-4) M) and histamine. These findings indicate that reduction of HPV by lipoxygenase inhibitors is not necessarily a consequence of inhibition of leukotriene synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that opiates increase the maximal external work performed at exhaustion in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanism responsible for this improvement in exercise tolerance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an oral morphine solution (0.8 mg/kg) on the exercise tolerance, perception of dyspnea, and arterial blood gases of patients with COPD. Thirteen eucapnic patients with stable COPD (FEV1 = 0.99 +/- 0.48) underwent duplicate incremental cycle ergometer tests to exhaustion (Emax) after the ingestion of placebo and after the ingestion of morphine. After the ingestion of morphine, the maximal workload increased by 18% (p less than 0.001) and the VO2 increased by 19.3% (p less than 0.001). Ten of the 13 patients had a higher ventilation at Emax after morphine ingestion. Despite the higher ventilation at Emax after morphine, the mean Borg score was not significantly higher. At Emax after morphine ingestion, the PaO2 (65.8 +/- 11.6 mm Hg) was significantly lower and the PaCO2 (43.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg) was significantly higher than at Emax after placebo (71.9 +/- 15.5 and 38.3 +/- 8.5, respectively). When data at the highest equivalent workload were analyzed, the ventilation and the Borg scores were significantly lower, whereas the VO2 and VCO2 were comparable. From this study, we conclude that the administration of opiates can substantially increase the exercise capacity of patients with COPD. The improved exercise tolerance appears to be related to both a higher PaCO2 resulting in lowered ventilation requirements for a given workload and also to a reduced perception of breathlessness for a given level of ventilation.\r"

We investigated the relationship between awake ventilatory drives to hypoxia and hypercapnia and sleep-disordered breathing in 21 subjects with sleep apnea syndrome. The awake hypoxic ventilatory drive, which was evaluated by occlusion pressure responses, was inversely correlated with the magnitude of maximal oxygen desaturation during sleep as well as the ratio of duration with more than 4 and 10% oxygen desaturation to total sleep time. On the other hand, the awake hypercapnic ventilatory drive was not correlated with these parameters of sleep desaturation. Apnea index and duration were not correlated with the degree of hypoxic or hypercapnic ventilatory drive, respectively. Our study concluded that sleep desaturation is better correlated with hypoxic ventilatory drive than with hypercapnic ventilatory drive in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. These results are different from the results obtained in the patients with COPD in our previous study.\r"

DC formed clusters with T-lymphoblasts within 30 min at 37 degrees C, whereas alveolar and peritoneal macrophages did not. Antigen-independent binding developed between macrophages and CD4+ blasts by 4 h at 37 degrees C. Binding by alveolar macrophages was trypsin sensitive, magnesium dependent, serum independent, and cold insensitive, whereas binding by DC required serum and was inhibited by cold. Cluster formation (cell aggregates greater than 250 microns 2) by macrophages and CD4+ blasts was increased by interferon-gamma and phorbol esters, but diminished by lipopolysaccharide. However, each of these factors increased cluster formation by blasts with DC. Efforts to promote antigen-independent binding of T cells by Ia+ macrophages did not alter their poor accessory cell capacities. The role of cluster formation in accessory cell activities was examined. Inhibitors of DC clustering, including trypsin, paraformaldehyde, and tunicamycin, abrogated the ability of DC to support antigen presentation and lectin-mediated proliferation. It is concluded that rapid antigen-independent binding to T-cells is a distinct property that is restricted to DC. Exposure to LPS may down regulate nonproductive binding of T-cells to alveolar macrophages. Our data further suggest that accessory cell activities in the rat are not a function of alveolar macrophages and may be limited to specialized Ia+ cells of dendritic lineage.\r"

The purpose of the experiments described here was to determine whether alveolar macrophages from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) differed from alveolar macrophages of normal subjects using a model system that assesses a component of cell-mediated immunity. Alveolar macrophages were tested for their ability to phagocytose and kill the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Because this system requires the stimulation of macrophages by antigen-specific T-cells, it allows the assessment of effector functions of macrophages found in the lower respiratory tract of patients with IPF. Data showed that alveolar macrophages from normal subjects both phagocytosed and killed those bacteria. However, alveolar macrophages from patients with IPF phagocytosed bacteria normally but expressed little bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Further, we found no difference in HLA-DR expression by normal and IPF alveolar macrophages. Therefore, it does not appear that this defect in bactericidal activity in IPF macrophages results from a defect in the antigen-presenting function of these cells. These data suggest that alveolar macrophages from patients with IPF express a functional deficiency in their ability to kill facultative intracellular bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation of cotton mill dust or condensed tannin, a major botanical component of cotton mill dust, induces an acute pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by a rapid influx of neutrophils into the airways. The development of neutrophil alveolitis caused by tannin inhalation is accompanied by the accumulation of low molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) in the airways. To determine if the alveolar macrophage is the source of this NCF, the ability of tannin to induce the secretion of NCF from rabbit alveolar macrophages was examined in vitro. Tannin did promote the secretion of NCF from alveolar macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Secretion began immediately after challenge and was maximal after 4 to 5 h. Maximal secretion occurred at a tannin concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Comparison with the dose response for NCF secretion by cotton dust extract indicated that tannin was the major component in the dust responsible for NCF secretion from alveolar macrophages in the time period examined. The NCF had an apparent molecular weight of greater than 800 as determined by gel chromatography. The NCF could be extracted into organic solvents, suggesting it was a lipid. Its secretion, however, could not be prevented by treatment of the macrophages with the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaretic acid, demonstrating that the NCF was not leukotriene B4. These data indicate that the action of tannin on resident alveolar macrophages results in the secretion of a NCF that may be responsible for the acute neutrophil alveolitis associated with inhalation of cotton dust.\r"

We therefore measured the release of arachidonate metabolites into sheep bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after local instillation of Ascaris antigen, using a highly specific and sensitive approach, gas chromatography-negative ion-chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Allergen instillation caused increases in the levels of the potent bronchoconstrictors prostaglandin (PG) D2 and thromboxane (TX) A2 (as reflected by levels of TXB2) and of their enzymatic metabolites, 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 and 11-dehydro-TXB2, respectively. Potential bronchodilators, PGI2 and PGE2, were also formed in increased amounts. Levels of the 5-lipoxygenase products, leukotriene (LT) B4 and C4, were not significantly increased. Pretreatment of sheep with cyclooxygenase inhibitors was associated with a decrease in the release of cyclooxygenase products and a concomitant increase in the allergen-stimulated release of LTB4 and LTC4. Eicosanoids are formed promptly in vivo in sheep after allergen instillation: inhibition of cyclooxygenase results in augmented generation of leukotrienes in the airways of sensitive sheep in response to antigen challenge.\r"

The percentage of originally added label remaining in lung or lavage was determined 2 min after instillation, with the remainder of the label having been transferred out of the lung. Peptidoleukotrienes were found to be largely (greater than 85%) retained in the lung after 2 min, and even after 15 min, more than 50% of the added radiolabel remained in the lung. In clear contrast, greater than 90% of the radiolabeled prostaglandin (PG) D2 was removed from the lung within 2 min after instillation. PGE2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene (LT) B4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) were also quickly removed from the lung, with less than 30% of the added label remaining in the lung after 2 min. Arachidonic acid and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were removed more slowly from the lung, with 40 to 70% remaining in the lung 2 min after instillation. The arachidonic acid remaining in the lung was largely esterified into phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine. The 5-HETE radiolabel remaining in the lung was also associated in part with phosphatidylcholine. The radioactivity remaining in the lung after [3H] LTB4, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGD2, and thromboxane B2 instillation reflected predominantly unmetabolized eicosanoids. The peptidoleukotrienes underwent a slow metabolism from LTC4 to LTD4 to LTE4. In addition, LTE4 was metabolized to a more polar product with chromatographic properties identical to those of N-acetyl LTE4. Rat lung slices and homogenates also metabolized peptidoleukotrienes via this pathway, although less N-acetyl LTE4 was produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In situ complement activation was induced in isolated, ventilated, and blood-free perfused rabbit lungs. Six to 11% human serum (vol/vol) was repeatedly admixed to the recirculating Krebs Henseleit buffer during 10-min periods, interrupted by rinsing phases with serum-free medium. This caused dose-dependent, reversible, and reproducible pulmonary artery pressor responses with pressure peaks or plateaus of 8 to 22 mm Hg. Pressor responses were paralleled by a marked release of thromboxane (TxA2) and prostaglandin I2 into the medium. Heat-inactivated serum, purified fluid-phase SC5b-9, and serum that had been activated with inulin in the absence or presence of a carboxypeptidase inhibitor all failed to elicit pressor responses. Both pressor response and prostanoid release were strictly dependent on complement factor C8, and evidence for C8 binding was obtained with the use of 125I-C8. Inhibitor studies collectively indicated that TxA2 was the predominant vasoconstrictive agent. Although repetitive short-term application of human serum induced no major lung weight gain, prolonged exposure to serum (40 to 80 min) without intermittent rinsing phases caused a delayed increase in the capillary filtration coefficient to maximally 3- to 4-fold values, with marked lung edema formation. We conclude that in situ activation of complement in the rabbit lung vasculature causes immediate intrapulmonary prostanoid generation and thromboxane-mediated vasoconstriction, independent of circulating leukocytes, but dependent on the formation of terminal membrane-complement complexes. Continuous complement activation results in a delayed increase in lung vascular permeability.\r"

DESIGN: A partially randomized phase I and II outpatient, dose-ranging study. SETTING: Four university medical centers involving government-supported referral AIDS Clinical Trial Units. PATIENTS: Sixty-one patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex and 100 pg/mL or more serum p24 antigen titers. INTERVENTIONS: Dideoxycytidine was administered orally at 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, or 0.005 mg/kg body weight every 4 hours for 3 to 6 months depending on tolerance and benefit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients receiving 0.06 and 0.03 mg/kg, diffuse erythematous rash, fever, and aphthous stomatitis occurred in the first weeks of therapy, but resolved later. Hematopoietic suppression was rare. Peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in patients receiving 0.06 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg and improved after discontinuation of therapy. Serum p24 antigen fell significantly (P less than 0.01) from baseline entry values in most of these patients. The CD4 lymphocytes rose transiently at the 0.03 mg/kg dosage. At the 0.005 mg/kg dosage, skin rash, fever, and aphthous stomatitis were mild or absent. Peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in all patients receiving 0.01 mg/kg was less severe than at higher dosages. At the 0.005 mg/kg dosage, peripheral neuropathy was occasionally seen. Significant suppression of serum p24 antigen was seen in most patients with AIDS-related complex receiving 0.01 mg/kg and less frequently in patients receiving 0.005 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Less toxic regimens of dideoxycytidine merit clinical assessment for advanced anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection. Several studies alternating dideoxycytidine and zidovudine are in progress.\r"

We studied a case of acute lithium carbonate intoxication characterized by a prolonged comatose state, severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and glucose intolerance. Of interest, the patient's symptoms and signs of toxic reaction developed after normalization of the plasma lithium ion levels. We reviewed the multisystemic toxic effects of lithium carbonate as well as its teratogenic potential and guidelines for its use during pregnancy. The management of acute lithium carbonate intoxication should include hydration with normal saline, intensive care monitoring, and dialysis if indicated.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine the dynamics of venous return and venous volume, using impedance volume measurements in the venous system. In order to develop a methodology for the assessment of venous volume and venous return in man, we first studied 17 endotracheally intubated and ventilated anesthetized closed-chest dogs. We measured central venous and inferior vena cava (IVC) pressure (micromanometer) and volume (impedance catheter). Studies were done above and below the diaphragm with normal ventilation, with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and with beta-adrenergic blockade and i.v. nitroglycerin. Intrathoracic IVC volume fell and extrathoracic IVC volume rose with lung inflation, while PEEP raised extrathoracic IVC volume and lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. Nitroglycerin lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. Beta blockade did not affect IVC volume, ventilatory variation, or response to PEEP and nitroglycerin. We performed similar studies in 14 human subjects during normal quiet respiration, with measurements above and below the diaphragm, and with interventions including Valsalva maneuver and i.v. nitroglycerin. Intrathoracic IVC volume fell and extrathoracic IVC volume rose with expiration and Valsalva maneuver. Nitroglycerin again lowered intrathoracic IVC volume. We conclude that venous volume and the dynamics of venous return can be assessed in animals and man with an impedance catheter. Specifically, we show the divergent effects of respiration, ventilation, PEEP, and nitroglycerin on IVC volumes above and below the diaphragm. Beta-adrenergic blockage does not appear to play a role in altering any of these effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which polyamino acids containing L-arginine, L-lysine or L-ornithine cause endothelium-dependent relaxation of bovine intrapulmonary artery and vein. Basic but not acidic or neutral polypeptides ranging in average molecular weights from 17 to 225 kDa elicited time- and concentration-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation in precontracted rings of artery and vein by endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Vascular responses were markedly inhibited by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, or potassium. The basic polyamino acids stimulated the formation and/or release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) identified as nitric oxide (NO) in perfused segments of both artery and vein as assessed by bioassay. The polyamino acids and A23187 released a similar endothelium-derived NO (EDNO) from artery and vein, as assessed by the similar half-life (3-5 seconds), antagonism by superoxide anion or oxyhemoglobin, enhancement by superoxide dismutase, and lack of influence by indomethacin. The basic polyamino acids elicited potent relaxant responses with EC50 values ranging from 3 x 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-7) M, and a direct correlation was obtained between molecular weight and relaxation potency irrespective of the basic amino acid incorporated. Prolonged contact of arterial or venous rings with basic polyamino acids resulted in the rapid development of marked refractoriness to relaxation and cyclic GMP formation on addition of polyamino acid. Moreover, refractoriness developed to the vascular responses of other endothelium-dependent vasodilators but not to glyceryl trinitrate or isoproterenol. The mechanism of refractory responses was attributed to interference with EDNO formation and release as assessed by bioassay and chemical assay. The hypothesis is forwarded that the basic polyamino acids serve as partial substrates for the enzyme system that catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine to NO. Prolonged contact between substrate and enzyme results in enzyme desensitization and the development of refractoriness or a form of tolerance to vasodilators whose action is mediated by EDNO.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that vasopressin potentiates the natriuresis produced by atriopeptin. In five anesthetized dogs of this study, we found that the potentiation was proportional to the dose of vasopressin infused. Sodium excretion was 46 +/- 16 mueq/min with atriopeptin (103-126) (AP24) alone (0.36 nmol/kg.min), was increased to 127 +/- 29 by concomitant intravenous infusion of 0.4 mU/kg.min vasopressin, was further increased to 301 +/- 75 by 1.2 mU/kg.min vasopressin and leveled off at 328 +/- 37 with 3.6 mU/kg.min vasopressin. To investigate whether the potentiation by vasopressin was due to an intrarenal action, we infused three doses of vasopressin (0.04, 0.12, and 0.36 mU/kg.min) into the renal artery during intravenous AP24 infusion in a second group of five dogs. The natriuresis, 128 +/- 18 mueq/min, was unaffected by any intrarenal dose of vasopressin. In a third group, we determined whether the potentiation produced by vasopressin was mediated by a mechanism involving the renal nerves by denervating the left kidney before AP24 infusion. In the denervated kidneys, sodium excretion was increased from a control value of 33 +/- 5 mueq/min to 303 +/- 38 with AP24 alone and was unresponsive to subsequent intravenous vasopressin administration. The exaggerated natriuresis with AP24 alone was of the same magnitude as that produced by AP24 plus the highest doses of intravenous vasopressin in the innervated kidneys of the first group. From these results we conclude that the potentiation of AP-induced natriuresis by vasopressin is mediated by a mechanism involving the renal nerves and probably results from the known effect of vasopressin to inhibit renal nerve activity.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin has been demonstrated to negatively regulate pancreatic growth in vivo. In this study we used the AR4-2J rat pancreatic acinar tumor cell line to investigate the effect of a stable somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS) on cell proliferation. SMS induced an antiproliferative effect on both serum or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell proliferation; exposure of the cells for 48 h to SMS caused a slight inhibition of serum-induced proliferation (maximal inhibition, 26%) and abolished the growth-promoting effect of EGF. Maximal effect was observed with 10 nM SMS, and half-maximal (IC50) effect with 0.06-0.1 nM SMS. Binding studies with an iodinated derivative of SMS, [125I-Tyr3]SMS, revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites on AR4-2J plasma membranes with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 +/- 0.03 nM and a binding site number of 1.1 +/- 0.07 pmol/mg protein. Addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5-[gamma-thio] triphosphate (GTP gamma S), increased the rate of dissociation of the specifically bound peptide in agreement with the coupling of somatostatin receptors with a GTP-binding regulatory protein. The good agreement between the IC50 for SMS inhibition of cell proliferation and the apparent Kd for binding indicates that the characterized binding sites are the somatostatin receptors that mediate the antiproliferative effect of SMS. When cells were grown in serum-free medium EGF stimulated AR4-2J cell proliferation with half-maximal (ED50) and maximal effects at 0.6 and 10 nM EGF, respectively. This stimulatory effect of EGF was mediated by specific receptors, since binding studies with [125I]EGF indicated that AR4-2J cells contained a single class of EGF receptors (13,000 sites/cell), with an affinity constant for [125I]EGF (Kd = 0.9 +/- 0.09 nM) close to the ED50 for EGF stimulation of cell growth. To examine if SMS-induced growth inhibition involved a cAMP-dependent mechanism we first studied the effect of SMS on cAMP production. SMS had no effect on basal cAMP, but completely inhibited VIP-stimulated cAMP production with an IC50 of 0.2 nM. Pertussis toxin, which is known to abolish the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on adenylate cyclase activity in AR4-2J cells, did not reverse the ability of SMS to inhibit cell proliferation as well as EGF-induced cell proliferation. These data indicate that the antiproliferative effect of SMS does not involve the GTP-binding protein-mediated negative coupling of somatostatin receptors to adenylate cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The cells were cultured in medium containing 5% fetal calf serum in the absence or presence of gonadotropins. Within several hours after the addition of hCG to cultured human granulosa cells, the cells acquired a rounded and aggregated morphology with numerous thin and long processes. Cells cultured without the gonadotropin had a flat and extended morphology on the substrate, with a well developed stress fiber system and numerous large vinculin-containing adhesion plaques. The [35S]methionine-labeled protein pattern of hCG-treated cells obtained by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a 7- to 10-fold decrease in the synthesis of vinculin and the nonmuscle tropomyosin isoforms, and a 2- to 4-fold decrease in the synthesis of alpha-actinin and actin, without a comparable change in alpha- and beta-tubulin synthesis. In the absence of gonadotropins, human granulosa cells synthesized both the intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin and cytokeratin-type IF proteins 8 and 18 and, to a lesser extent, cytokeratins 7 and 19. By immunofluorescence, both type of IF networks were detected in untreated cells, while hCG-treated cells synthesized and contained only vimentin-type IF networks. Thus, maintenance of the steroidogenic capacity in the presence of gonadotropins in human granulosa-luteal cells involves specific changes in cell shape and in both the organization and the expression of the microfilament and IF systems.\r"

The objectives were to determine whether PRF from the posterior pituitary regulates the proestrous PRL surge, and to examine if there are interactions between PRF and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Posterior pituitary lobectomy (LOBEX) and passive immunization against VIP were employed. Adult cycling rats were subjected at 0900 h on proestrus to LOBEX or sham surgery (SHAM) under short term anesthesia, and were injected iv at 1330 h with 0.75 ml anti-VIP serum or normal rabbit serum. Jugular blood was collected hourly from 1400-2300 h and analyzed for PRL and LH by RIA. Oviductal ova were examined on estrus. The rise in plasma PRL in normal rabbit serum-treated SHAM rats was biphasic, with an early peak between 1500-1700 h and a lower plateau between 1900-2100 h. This rise was similar in profile and magnitude to that seen in intact rats. In contrast, LOBEX significantly attenuated the early peak, but did not alter the plateau. Passive immunization against VIP of either SHAM or LOBEX rats mimicked the effect of LOBEX alone on PRL release. Neither surgery nor anti-VIP serum affected the profile of the LH surge which was sharp and symmetrical, and all rats ovulated with 15-16 ova per rat. To determine whether VIP is the posterior pituitary PRF, selected tissues removed on proestrus or diestrus-1 were analyzed for VIP by RIA. VIP was undetectable (less than 20 pg/organ) in the posterior pituitary on either day examined. The contents of VIP in the anterior pituitary, medial basal hypothalamus, and paraventricular nuclei were unchanged between diestrus-1 and proestrus. Conclusions: The proestrous surge of PRL consists of two components: an early peak and a late plateau. The peak phase appears to be dependent on PRF input from the posterior pituitary. This input might be regulated by VIP, and interactions between the two could occur at the level of the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, or both. The plateau phase of the PRL surge is independent of the posterior pituitary and VIP, and might involve hypothalamic dopamine.\r"

Since keratinocytes produce 1,25-(OH)2D, we explored the possibility that IFN gamma acted on keratinocytes in part by regulating 1,25-(OH)2D production. We cultured human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes for various periods of time in the presence of various concentrations of IFN gamma before assessing their ability to produce 1,25-(OH)2D. The production of 1,25-(OH)2D by preconfluent keratinocytes grown in the presence of serum (which retards differentiation) was stimulated by 1.8 nM IFN gamma. Postconfluent keratinocytes did not respond to 1.8 nM IFN gamma. The production of 1,25-(OH)2D by keratinocytes grown in serum-free medium was maximally stimulated by 0.006 nM IFN gamma and inhibited at concentrations greater than 0.06 nM. Keratinocytes grown in 0.1 mM calcium serum-free medium (which prevents differentiation) were more sensitive to both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of IFN gamma than keratinocytes grown in 1.2 mM calcium serum-free medium (which permits differentiation). The stimulatory effect of IFN gamma on 1,25-(OH)2D production was maximal after 2 days of incubation. Incubations longer than 2 days showed increasingly less stimulation at the low IFN gamma concentrations and increasingly greater inhibition at the higher IFN gamma concentrations. The inhibitory effects of IFN gamma on 1,25-(OH)2D production paralleled the inhibitory effects of IFN gamma on cell growth. Thus, IFN gamma does regulate 1,25-(OH)2D production by keratinocytes. However, this regulation is modulated by the state of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and is influenced by calcium and undefined factors in serum. The data are consistent with the possibility that IFN gamma alters keratinocyte differentiation in part by regulating 1,25-(OH)2D production.\r"

  ".W": "In the female rat the period from days 7-20 of age is special with regard to regulation of hypophyseal hormone secretion. This period is characterized by high FSH levels and the occurrence of sporadic LH peaks. As it has been reported that haloperidol could enhance both gonadotropins at 12 days of age and not at later ages, it was of interest to treat rats during the infantile period with pergolide, a dopaminergic agent of long action, and evaluate its effect on hormone levels and puberty onset. Three different schedules of drug injections were applied: 1) daily injections (0.05 mg/kg.day) on days 1-10, 2) daily injections on days 5-14, and 3) daily injections on days 11-20. It was found that only animals treated with daily injections of pergolide on days 11-20 showed an advance in the age of vaginal opening and first estrus compared to distilled water-injected controls. Thus, the rest of the experiments were performed using injection schedule 3. In this group of animals serum LH and FSH levels were decreased 3 and 6 days after the beginning of pergolide treatment (13 and 16 days of age); at 19 days of age pergolide did not modify gonadotropin levels. One day after the end of pergolide treatment (day 21 of age), there was a rebound in LH levels in drug-injected rats, and a nonsignificant increment in FSH levels was observed. There were no differences in serum gonadotropin levels on days 22, 23, and 25 or peripubertally (29, 33, or 36 days of age). On the other hand, pergolide did not significantly modify PRL levels during the treatment, probably due to the already low values of PRL at these ages. Furthermore, PRL levels were not different between control and pergolide-injected rats at all other ages studied. After puberty onset, animals were observed for eight consecutive cycles, and both groups cycled regularly. Furthermore, PRL and gonadotropins levels were similar at diestrus and proestrus. To evaluate if pergolide treatment during the infantile period had caused permanent alteration in dopamine receptor sensitivity, animals were injected with haloperidol (0.1 or 0.25 mg/kg), and PRL release was evaluated. There were no differences in the hyperprolactinemic effect of the drug between groups. Finally, gonadotropin sensitivity to LHRH was similar in adult female rats in proestrus of both groups. The present results suggest that chronic activation of dopamine receptors during the infantile period evokes specific responses on gonadotropin secretion and advances the age of puberty onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) levels and LH secretion are suppressed in the lactating rat. To determine if LH synthesis is also inhibited, we have measured LH subunit mRNA levels in the pituitary of lactating rats. We have also examined the temporal relationship among restoration of GnRH-R, LH secretion, and LH synthesis after withdrawing the sensory stimulus of suckling. Pituitary alpha-subunit and LH beta mRNA levels were sharply reduced on day 10 of lactation in both intact and ovariectomized (OVX) animals compared with those in cycling diestrous rats or OVX controls. Removal of the suckling stimulus from OVX animals led to significant increases in alpha-subunit and LH beta mRNA levels by 24 h. Upon removal of the suckling stimulus from intact rats, alpha-subunit mRNA levels were restored by 48 h, but LH beta mRNA levels did not return to diestrous levels until 72 h. Pituitary GnRH-R levels were clearly up-regulated within 1 day after pup removal. Some LH pulses were observed by 48 h, but consistent plasma LH pulses were not detected until 72 h. When pulsatile GnRH was administered during the 24 h after pup removal from intact rats, the regimen of pulsatile GnRH was successful in inducing LH secretion; however, the restoration of pulsatile LH was not accompanied by increases in alpha-subunit and LH beta mRNA levels. The present studies provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that during lactation, the suppression of pituitary gonadotroph function is mainly due to the loss of hypothalamic GnRH secretion. Our data also show that 1) the restoration of GnRH-R alone is not sufficient to activate LH subunit mRNA and LH secretion; 2) the normal restoration of pulsatile LH secretion and increases in LH subunit mRNA are temporally correlated, as increases in LH secretion appear to precede increases in LH subunit mRNA; and 3) the restoration of pituitary LH subunit mRNA levels and pulsatile LH secretion took longer in the intact rat than in the OVX rat, suggesting that ovarian steroids may play a role in the inhibitory effect of lactation.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of the GnRH agonist [DAla6,NMe-Leu7,Pro9Net]GnRH to bovine anterior pituitary membranes is inhibited by guanyl nucleotides. The effect of guanyl nucleotides is temperature dependent, in that significant binding inhibition is observed when the receptor-hormone interaction is measured at 37 C, and no inhibition is seen at 4 C. Micromolar concentrations of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] displace the bound agonist in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal displacement occurring in a concentration range of 0.1-0.5 microM, and maximum displacement occurring at a concentration of 50 microM Gpp(NH)p. At a concentration of 50 microM, the other nucleotides GTP and GDP inhibit binding to a lesser extent, while GMP, cGMP, 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate [App(NH)p], ATP, and cAMP have no effect on the binding. At 37 C, Gpp(NH)p reduces the affinity of the agonist by a factor of 6 and increases its dissociation rate. In the presence of Gpp(NH)p at 37 C, there is also a 2-fold increase in the total number of binding sites. Under the same conditions as those used for the agonist, there is no displacement of the bound antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1,4ClDPhe2,D3Pal3,DLys6,Lys8,D Ala10]-GnRH by doses up to 50 microM Gpp(NH)p. The modulation of the binding of the agonist, but not that of the antagonist, by guanyl nucleotides is characteristic of receptors that are coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Thus, the GnRH receptor appears to be coupled to a GTP-binding protein that may play a role in the mechanism of action of GnRH at the pituitary.\r"

  ".U": "89107066\r", 
  ".W": "Rat hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIF) release in vitro is inversely related to medium glucose concentration and is stimulated by agents interfering with neural glucose uptake or metabolism. The present studies examined monosaccharide specificity of this effect by comparing the ability of glucose and nonmetabolized sugars (ribose, fructose, and galactose) to reverse glucopenia-mediated SRIF release. Removal of glucose from incubation medium resulted in a 7-fold stimulation of hypothalamic SRIF release (24.9 +/- 3.0 to 169.0 +/- 46.2 pg/5 min) that was promptly and fully reversed by readdition of glucose (21.5 +/- 6.0 pg/5 min). Depolarizing concentrations of potassium (40 mM) added to medium after incubation in the presence or absence of glucose produced similar 4-fold biphasic stimulation of SRIF release, suggesting that tissue viability was unimpaired by short term glucopenia. By contrast, nonmetabolized sugars (ribose, fructose, or galactose) at concentrations up to 28 mM were unable to reverse glucopenia-mediated hypothalamic SRIF release. These findings suggest that neural metabolism of glucose specifically influences hypothalamic SRIF release, an effect likely to depend on glycolysis with resulting energy production. This explanation is supported by the finding that the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde were partly, and pyruvate completely, able to restore glucopenia-mediated SRIF release toward basal, with a maximal effect at 14 mM. Our present studies suggest that rat hypothalamic SRIF release reflects ambient glucose status, is stimulated by glucopenia, and may explain inhibition of GH secretion in the rat during hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "Both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and somatostatin (SRIH) have been shown to directly inhibit GH release and the total GH content of cultured pituitary cells. In the present study we evaluated the interrelationship between the effects of a recombinant human IGF-I analog ([Thr59]IGF-I) and SRIH on GH release by cultured normal rat pituitary cells together with the effects of glucocorticoids. In all experiments anterior pituitary cells were preincubated for 24 h without or with IGF-I, SRIH, and/or dexamethasone. Thereafter, 24-h incubations without or with IGF-I, dexamethasone, SRIH, and GHRH were performed. Both IGF-I and SRIH inhibited basal and GHRH-stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner; the maximal inhibitory concentrations were 5 nM IGF-I and 10 nM SRIH. These concentrations inhibited basal and GHRH-stimulated GH release by 23% and 40% (IGF-I) and 80% and 85% (SRIH), respectively. The combination of IGF-I and low concentrations of SRIH exerted an additive inhibitory effect on GHRH-stimulated GH release; IGF-I (1 nM) and SRIH (10 pM) together inhibited GH release by 50%, while the maximal inhibitory concentrations of 5 nM IGF-I and 10 nM SRIH virtually completely inhibited GH release (by 93%). Preincubation with 5 and 100 nM dexamethasone attenuated the sensitivity of somatotrophs to SRIH and completely abolished the inhibitory effects of IGF-I. This effect of dexamethasone could be reversed by coincubation with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 38486. High concentrations of 5-10 nM of the recombinant human IGF-I analog stimulated PRL cell content (5 and 10 nM) and release (10 nM), while a purified IGF-I preparation extracted from human blood exerted a parallel inhibitory effect on GH and PRL release. We conclude that 1) IGF-I and SRIH exert an additive direct inhibitory effect on basal and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion by normal cultured pituitary cells; 2) glucocorticoids directly attenuate the sensitivity of somatotrophs to SRIH, but completely prevent the inhibitory effects of IGF-I on GH secretion; and 3) in contrast to a purified IGF-I preparation extracted from human blood (which inhibits GH and PRL release) high concentrations of the recombinant IGF-I preparation (which inhibit GH release) stimulate PRL production.\r"

This method also permitted Scatchard analysis of the receptor binding in pellet fractions of human breast cancer biopsies remaining from estrogen and progesterone receptor assays. The potent agonist [D-Trp6]LHRH bound to at least two classes of receptor sites, one with high affinity and one with low affinity in both rat pituitary and human breast cancer samples. The analysis of displacement curves of LHRH by agonists and antagonists showed that LHRH also bound to two classes of receptor sites in pituitary and one receptor site with lower affinity in human breast cancer membranes. Among the antagonists synthesized in our laboratory, SB-030, SB-077, SB-088, and SB-090 appeared to be the most potent in displacing labeled [D-Trp6]LHRH and showed the highest binding affinity to the pituitary and breast cancer membranes. Labeled antagonists showed somewhat less affinity to membranes of pituitaries and human cancers than the agonists and bound to only a single class of receptor population. Both agonists and antagonists were able to bind to membranes of human breast cancer samples, and some antagonists were very potent in this respect. Certain LHRH agonists or antagonists could be capable of exerting direct inhibitory effects on breast cancers depending upon the presence and characteristics of LHRH receptors.\r"

For comparison, the effect of LTG on hippocampal afterdischarge duration was also studied in halothane anaesthetised rats, a species in which the anticonvulsant action of LTG has been widely investigated. The known anticonvulsants phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) were included for comparison. LTG reduced afterdischarge duration in a dose-dependent manner in rat and dog; it was approximately twofold more potent than PHT in the dog and three- to fourfold more potent than PB in both dog and rat (LTG ED50 values = 4.5 and 11.7 mg.kg-1 i.v. in dogs and rats, respectively). PHT was ineffective in the rat at sublethal doses (less than 40 mg.kg-1 i.v.). In limited studies in marmosets, i.v. administration of both LTG and PHT (both 5-15 mg.kg-1) reduced or abolished afterdischarge. Thus, LTG was a potent anticonvulsant in rat, dog, and marmoset in afterdischarge models of partial (focal) seizures and may be of utility in the treatment of partial seizures in humans.\r"

Seizure type was infantile spasms (IS) in 16, generalized tonic seizures in 8, secondarily generalized partial seizures in 4, generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 2, atypical absence in 5, myoclonic seizures in 1, and atonic seizures in 2 cases. All seizure types were classified by ictal EEGs documented by simultaneous EEG-VTR according to the International Classification of seizures, except for two with atonic seizures and one with IS. Factors analyzed were sex, age, etiology, neurologic abnormality, seizure types, seizure frequency, EEGs, duration of TRH therapy, and serum hormone [human growth hormone (HGH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] levels before and after TRH therapy. We showed that: (a) serum PRL level was significantly correlated to effectiveness of TRH therapy (the higher the PRL, the greater the response rate); (b) serum basal PRL decreased significantly, especially in good responders; and (c) serum basal PRL was elevated especially in patients with IS, which responded more to TRH therapy. These interesting findings seen in severe epilepsy of childhood deserve further neuroendocrinologic study.\r"

Seizure frequencies for the pre-AZM baseline period (CBZ monotherapy) were compared with the seizure frequencies at different daily doses of AZM. Patients with a 50% decrease in seizure frequency were considered responders. Twenty-one patients were responders (44%) and three became completely seizure-free. Effective doses ranged from 3.8 to 22.0 mg/kg/day. Effective plasma concentrations ranged from 1 to 22 micrograms/ml in selected patients. Durations of response time to AZM ranged from 3 to 30 months (average 12.9 months). Three patients lost response, one temporarily.

Eighteen women received intramuscular (IM) depot LA 3.75 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (group A); 20 women received IM placebo with the same injection schedule (group B). Group A patients had a mean reduction in pretreatment uterine volume from 505 +/- 93 cu cm (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 305 +/- 57 cu cm after 12 weeks (P less than 0.05 versus pretreatment) and 307 +/- 57 cu cm after 24 weeks of therapy (P less than 0.05 versus therapy (P less than 0.05 versus pretreatment). At 3 months after cessation of therapy, the mean uterine volume in group A had increased to 446 +/- 92 cu cm (P less than 0.05 versus week 24). Group B patients had no significant change in uterine volume over the 24-week treatment period. These results suggest that depot LA therapy may significantly decrease uterine volume in patients with leiomyomata, but that regrowth of uterine size occurs shortly after cessation of therapy.\r"

The HA women showed a greater acceleration of LH pulsatility after CC than EFP women but there was a decrease in their LH response to GnRH. Naloxone caused an increase in LH pulsatility in HA but not EFP women, although this effect was less than that seen with CC. We conclude that, in HA women, the GnRH pacemaker, but not the pituitary, is inhibited by increased sensitivity to the negative feedback effect of estradiol and increased opiate tone.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression before gonadotropin stimulation in 26 patients with failed prior in vitro fertilization (IVF) attempts and variable basal serum gonadotropin levels. Leuprolide, 1 mg subcutaneously per day, was administered from the midluteal phase of the cycle before IVF treatment. Concomitantly, stimulation was initiated on cycle day 3 with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Based on their prior IVF attempts and serum gonadotropin levels on cycle day 3, 9 patients were high responders with elevated mean basal luteinizing hormone (LH)/FSH, 8 were low responders with elevated mean basal FSH/LH, 7 were intermediate responders with normal mean basal FSH/LH and a history of premature LH surge, and 2 had elevated (perimenopausal) mean FSH and LH. Leuprolide was discontinued on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Prior IVF attempts in the same patients with the same protocol, but without GnRHa suppression, were used as controls. The mean number of ampules of hMG and FSH was significantly higher in leuprolide cycles than in controls. The mean day of hCG administration was also higher for leuprolide cycles than for controls. The mean LH and progesterone levels on the day of hCG were significantly lower in leuprolide cycles. The mean number of preovulatory oocytes aspirated and transferred was higher in leuprolide cycles. Cancellation and pregnancy rates were improved in leuprolide cycles. It is concluded that prior GnRHa suppression is beneficial for follicular recruitment for IVF. More patients with variable basal serum gonadotropin levels need to be studied before definite recommendations are made.\r"

Advanced endometrial histologic maturity was recorded in 9 of the 12 stimulated cycles. No in-phase endometria were seen when the preovulatory plasma estradiol (E2) was greater than 500 pg/ml or the day 16 plasma progesterone (P) greater than 10 ng/ml in natural or stimulated cycles. Significant negative correlations were noted between both preovulatory E2 and day 16 P and the concentration of cytosolic progesterone receptor (PRc). Advanced endometrial maturity tended to be associated with low concentrations of PRc. Regardless of endometrial maturity, the natural cycle was characterized by low cytosolic E2 receptors (ERc) and high PRc, whereas the concentration of both receptors was usually greatly reduced in stimulated cycles. It is concluded that the advanced endometrial maturation observed in stimulated IVF cycles is a consequence of the production of supraphysiologic levels of sex steroids by the corpus luteum that cause profound modifications of endometrial receptor dynamics.\r"

These declined thereafter but continued to fluctuate at abnormal levels for 32 weeks. Liver biopsies showed liver cell swelling and inflammation with focal necrosis. Portal tracts and areas around central veins were heavily infiltrated with mononuclear cells. A fourth animal (no previous exposure to hepatitis viruses) inoculated with GB was killed on Day 15 postinoculation. Serum and extracts of liver and feces from this day were used as inocula for three other animals. Only the serum and liver extract transmitted GB hepatitis. The fecal specimen did not transmit and a fecal extract taken at a later date from another animal was also noninfectious. GB hepatitis virus is distinct from the viruses causing Type A and blood-borne non-A, non-B-hepatitis. Although the virus is present in serum and has previously been transmitted per os, it is not shed in feces.\r"

However, this beneficial effect on splanchnic hemodynamics was accompanied by a significant reduction in arterial pressure. Using conscious dogs, we investigated the effect of the chronic oral administration of a new specific antiserotonergic drug, ritanserin (10 mg per day for 5 days), on portal pressure and systemic hemodynamics. Eleven dogs with secondary biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to chronic bile duct ligation were evaluated. One week prior to study, heparinized catheters were placed in the portal vein and brought subcutaneously to the dorsal cervical area. Measurements were made under baseline conditions, following ritanserin administration and 72 hr after the last dose. Ritanserin administration caused a significant reduction in portal pressure (from 17.3 +/- 3.1 mmHg to 13.6 +/- 4.5 mmHg; mean decrease: 23.1%; p less than 0.001). Maximal effects on portal pressure were reached on the fourth day. During the recovery period, hemodynamic parameters returned to baseline values. In six of the 11 cirrhotic dogs with successful chronic catheterization of the inferior vena cava and aorta, ritanserin administration did not cause significant changes in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. These data indicate that chronic implantation of venous and arterial catheters in dogs with secondary biliary cirrhosis is a useful experimental model for pharmacological studies of portal hypertension in conscious animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control of bleeding was assessed over a 12-hr period following entry into the trial. Patients in the vasopressin + nitroglycerin group were then treated by sclerotherapy, as were those in the sclerotherapy group who continued to bleed. At 12 hr, bleeding was controlled in 29 (88%) of the 33 episodes treated by sclerotherapy compared with 20 (65%) of 31 episodes treated by vasopressin + nitroglycerin (p less than 0.05). Recurrence of variceal bleeding occurred at the same frequency (31%). Although admission mortality was less in those initially treated by sclerotherapy compared to those managed by vasopressin + nitroglycerin, this did not reach statistical significance (27 and 39%, respectively, p greater than 0.20). Sclerotherapy carried out as the first treatment of the active variceal hemorrhage proved both safe and effective, even in the presence of major hemorrhage, and as compared to combined vasopressin and nitroglycerin it proved superior.\r"

The serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids and apolipoproteins AI and AIV increased significantly after 1 week of ethanol feeding, and they remained elevated up to 7 weeks of alcohol drinking. By contrast, serum total apolipoprotein E decreased or, sometimes, did not change. Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein E of the alcohol-fed rats increased in parallel and were about 2- to 2.5-fold over the controls. Whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, phospholipids, apolipoprotein AI and AIV increased 1.2-fold by chronic alcohol feeding, the level of high-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein E decreased to 70% of that of the control rats. The rates of secretion of apolipoprotein AI, E and AIV into the culture medium by hepatocytes isolated from ethanol-fed rats were 1.8-, 1.3- and 1.1-fold higher than those from control rats. These data indicate that (i) chronic ethanol feeding increases very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein in the rat; (ii) serum high-density lipoprotein particles of the ethanol-fed rats are deficient in apolipoprotein E, and (iii) chronic ethanol feeding increases hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein AI, E and AIV. Since the steady-state serum level of apolipoprotein E decreases or remains unchanged in the presence of increased hepatic apolipoprotein E secretion, this imbalance suggests that alcohol feeding either accelerates the rate of degradation of serum apolipoprotein E or suppresses apolipoprotein E synthesis by nonhepatic tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of thyroidectomy and of thyroid hormone administration on the hepatic transport of endogenous bilirubin were investigated in the Wistar R/APfd rat. Hypothyroidism resulted in an enhanced hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and in a decreased p-nitrophenol transferase activity. It caused a cholestatic condition with a 50% decrease in bile flow and bile salt excretion, and an increased proportion of conjugated bilirubin in serum. The biliary output of unconjugated and monoconjugated bilirubins decreased in parallel by about 65%, whereas the excretion rate of the diconjugate dropped by only 47%, resulting in an increased di- to monoconjugate ratio in bile. Hyperthyroidism was characterized by a decreased bilirubin and an increased p-nitrophenol transferase activity, and by an augmented bilirubin output in bile. The output of unconjugated and monoconjugated bilirubins increased in parallel by about 50 or 100%, whereas the excretion of the diconjugate increased by only 20 to 50%, depending on the dose of thyroxine administered; this resulted in a decreased di- to monoconjugate ratio in bile. A linear positive relationship was found between bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and the ratio of bilirubin di- to monoconjugates present in bile or formed by in vitro incubation of liver homogenates at low concentration of bilirubin (10 to 15 microM), indicating that bile pigment composition is mainly determined by the conjugation activity in the liver. The inverse relationship observed between hepatic beta-glucuronidase activity and the ratio of di- to monoconjugates in bile warrants further investigation to analyze whether this enzyme activity also plays a possible role in the changes in bile pigment composition in hypo- and hyperthyroid rats.\r"

At follow-up with a duration of as much as two years, there were no consistent differences in the clinical results between the three groups. The time lost from work and the proportion of excellent and good clinical results were also uninfluenced by the postoperative regimen. No adverse effects could be detected as a result of the patient's having walked before the syndesmosis screw had been removed.

Gonococci were either serum resistant in the absence but serum sensitive in the presence, of McAb 10, or serum sensitive or serum resistant regardless of the presence of McAb 10. Strain JS3, which fell in the former category, was used in subsequent studies. C1 zymogen formed by reassociation of isolated C1 subunits was not directly activated by JS3 in the presence or absence of C1-inhibitor. JS3 thus was unable to directly activate the classical pathway independently of antibody. When purified classical pathway components were used to deposit C3 on JS3 in the absence of serum regulatory proteins or antibodies, added C1-inhibitor reduced C3 binding to background levels. When McAb 10 was present, C3 binding was unaffected by C1-inhibitor. Covalently bound, large molecular weight C3 alpha-chain-gonococcal complexes were disbanded by methylamine release of ester linkages. Released 125I-C3 migrated as C3b without degradation by gonococcal proteases. Purified classical components alone or McAb 10 alone facilitated JS3 killing by neutrophils; when combined, the two provided maximal killing.

  ".W": "We ligated the left anterior descending coronary artery for 1 or 2 h in 31 purebred beagles. We did not detect any changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density or affinity when normal and ischemic zones were compared, either in the subendocardium or in the subepicardium. In the ischemic zones, there was a significant decline in all measures of adenylate cyclase activity, including activity mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. By contrast, after chronic beta-adrenergic blockade (1.5 mg/kg propranolol i.v. twice daily for 7 d), there was an increase in adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by (-)-isoproterenol relative to adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by guanyl-5'imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) in both normal and ischemic tissue, suggesting that one effect of chronic beta blockade may be to enhance coupling between the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) and the beta-adrenergic receptor, despite a reduction in the number or function of Gs units. Chronic beta blockade also led to up regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor density in subepicardial regions. After 20 min of reperfusion following 2 h of ischemia, adenylate cyclase activity tended to return to control levels, particularly in the subepicardium, where (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not different from normal myocardium. We conclude that chronic beta-adrenergic blockade may have beneficial effects during prolonged episodes of myocardial ischemia by preserving signal transduction mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The hypotensive, natriuretic, and diuretic actions of human atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126) (hANF) are accompanied by an elevation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in plasma and urine. However, the oxidized hANF analogue, human [Met-O110]ANF-(99-126) (Met-O-ANF), has been reported to be unable to increase cGMP (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 128: 538-546). We employed this oxidized peptide to evaluate the relationship between its biological effects and cGMP generation, with cGMP serving as a marker of the recognized property of ANF to stimulate particulate guanylate cyclase. Met-O-ANF appeared to be a partial agonist, exhibiting a decreasing order of relative potency of hypotensive, vasorelaxant, diuretic, and natriuretic functions compared to hANF. A lower degree of cGMP increases was achieved by this analogue in cultured smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Met-O-ANF doses, which led to a significant increase in diuresis, were neither natriuretic nor accompanied by an increase of urinary cGMP. We were thus able to dissociate the diuretic and natriuretic effects of ANF. High doses of the oxidized analogue were required to elevate cGMP levels in plasma and urine. In isolated kidney fractions, Met-O-ANF's action on cGMP was significantly lower in glomeruli (fivefold less), virtually absent in the collecting duct, yet only slightly different (20% less) in thick ascending limb. Our results indicate that the diuretic and natriuretic effects are exerted at distinct sites, with only the natriuresis being related to an increase of extracellular cGMP. The variability of differential potency of biological and biochemical effects from tissue to tissue of these two forms of human ANF support the notion of the heterogeneity of the ANF effector system.\r"

These stimulated keratinocytes presented herpes simplex antigen directly to autologous blood-derived T lymphocytes in four of four subjects (stimulation indices: 1.5-2.7), suggesting that keratinocytes may have an accessory herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigen-presenting role in addition to the Langerhans cells and macrophages in herpetic skin lesions. Blood mononuclear cells from eight herpes simplex seropositive subjects which were activated in vitro by HSV antigen for 6 d showed cytotoxicity specific for HSV in infected autologous keratinocytes. This was significantly increased by prestimulation with IFN gamma (51-56% to 83-85%). In four of eight patients some cytotoxicity also occurred against uninfected, IFN gamma-stimulated keratinocytes. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed that cytotoxicity against HSV-infected, IFN gamma-stimulated keratinocyte targets was mediated by both CD3+ T lymphocytes and Leu 11b+ natural killer cells. T lymphocyte cytotoxicity was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, suggesting a cytotoxic role for the activated CD4+ lymphocytes that initially predominate in herpetic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The severe complications of dengue virus infections, hemorrhagic manifestations and shock, are more commonly observed during secondary dengue virus infections than during primary infections. It has been speculated that these complications are mediated by cross-reactive host-immune responses. We have begun to analyze human T cell responses to dengue antigens in vitro to explain the possible role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of these complications. Dengue antigens induce proliferative responses of PBMC from dengue antibody-positive donors, but do not induce specific proliferative responses of PBMC from dengue antibody-negative donors. IFN gamma is detected in the culture fluids of dengue-immune PBMC stimulated with dengue antigens. The cells that proliferate in the dengue antigen-stimulated bulk cultures have CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD16-, and CD20- phenotypes. Dengue-specific T cell lines were established using limiting dilution techniques. They have CD3+, CD4+, and CD8- phenotypes, and produce IFN gamma in response to dengue antigens. Culture fluids from dengue-immune PBMC stimulated with dengue antigens, which contain IFN gamma, augment dengue virus infection of human monocytes by dengue virus-antibody complexes. These results indicate that PBMC from dengue-immune donors contain CD4+ T cells that proliferate and produce IFN gamma after stimulation with dengue antigens, and suggest that the IFN gamma that is produced by these stimulated dengue-specific T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome by increasing the number of dengue virus-infected monocytes in the presence of cross-reactive anti-dengue antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of estrogens on \"free\" and total calcitriol levels and on the calcitriol response to a hypocalcemic challenge in 12 postmenopausal women, age 55-74 yr. Endogenous calcitriol production was induced by intravenous Na-EDTA before and after conjugated estrogens, 1.25 mg/d for 30 d. Free calcitriol was determined by centrifugal ultrafiltration and by the molar ratio of calcitriol to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). Estrogen increased fasting total calcitriol from 38.5 +/- 3.8 to 62.3 +/- 7.0 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). This was accompanied by a rise in free calcitriol from 104.5 +/- 11.4 to 158.7 +/- 16.4 fg/ml (P less than 0.05). Vitamin D-binding protein increased from 348 +/- 16 to 428 +/- 12 micrograms/ml (P less than 0.001), and the ratio of calcitriol/DBP increased from 1.50 +/- 0.14 to 1.94 +/- 0.18 (P less than 0.005), confirming the rise in free calcitriol. Increases in free calcitriol and in calcitriol/DBP ratios were significantly correlated, r = 0.72. Hypocalcemia led to a rapid increase in circulating immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and to a rise in calcitriol at 24 h. The hypocalcemia-induced rise in total and free calcitriol was similar before and after estrogen, whether expressed as increments or as percent changes. We conclude that estrogen increases circulating levels of biologically active free calcitriol in postmenopausal women, but that a 30-d period of estrogen administration does not apparently improve the renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase response to a PTH challenge.\r"

BMMC depleted of either CD3, CD2, or both could replicate HIV-1 irrespective of the presence of macrophages/monocytes. Infected bone marrow cells were shown to differentiate during the culture into CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD1+ cells, whereas noninfected BMMC gave rise to CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells. Moreover, 9-14% of the cells also expressed the viral proteins p24 and gp120 on their surface. Double staining studies revealed that 72 and 83% of the CD4+ cells expressed the gp120 and p24, respectively, suggesting that virus replication occurred in CD4+ cells. T cell colony growth from infected BMMC, either unfractionated or depleted of mature T cells, was impaired in a time-dependent manner, and the differentiation capacity of T cell precursors was abnormal. Colony cells displayed an immature cell phenotype (CD1+ cells) and the viral proteins gp120 and/or p24 could also be detected on CD1+ cells. In addition, pooled colony cells derived from infected CD2- and CD3-depleted BMMC could infect normal mitogen-activated lymphocytes in coculture experiments. These findings strongly suggest that HIV-1 can infect immature bone marrow T cells and be transmitted to the progeny, but the massive viral replication occurs only when the cells differentiate toward CD4+ cells.\r"

Human subjects had lower plasma ANF concentrations in the pulmonary vein or the pulmonary capillary wedge position when compared with the pulmonary artery, and both sites yielded pulmonary ANF extraction ratios of 24%. Canine lung ANF extraction was 19 +/- 3% and pulmonary ANF clearance was 328 +/- 78 ml/min per m2 vs. 357 +/- 53 ml/min per m2 in man. Hepatic plasma ANF clearance was 216 +/- 26 ml/min with an extraction ratio of 30 +/- 3% in humans and 199 +/- 89 ml/min and 36 +/- 6% in the dog. Renal plasma ANF clearance in human subjects was 78 +/- 12 ml/min per kidney and correlated well with each kidney's creatinine clearance (r = 0.58, P less than 0.05). The mean renal ANF extraction ratio was 35 +/- 4% in human subjects and 42 +/- 6% in the dog. These data quantitate the specific organ ANF clearances by lung, liver, and kidney in human subjects and in dogs and provide a rationale for elevated plasma ANF levels in cirrhosis, renal failure, and diseases accompanied by reduced perfusion of these organs. These findings support the conclusion that plasma ANF concentrations are dependent upon both the stimuli for ANF secretion as well as the specific organ clearances of ANF.\r"

We examine the effects of the cytokine interferon (IFN) on barrier function of cultured monolayers of the T84 human intestinal epithelial cell line. Gamma IFN, in concentrations and exposures required to show its other biological effects, directly affects such monolayers. Monolayer resistance is substantially diminished by gamma IFN. Such effects were not due to cytotoxicity as judged morphologically and by LDH assays. Solute fluxes and dual Na+-mannitol flux analysis indicate that the resistance decrease is due to an effect of gamma IFN on tight junction permeability. The effects of gamma IFN on monolayer barrier function were not duplicated by the cytokines interleukin 1, interleukin 2, or tumor necrosis factor. We speculate that such products of activation of lymphoid cells might influence barrier function of intestinal, and perhaps other epithelia in disease states.\r"

For each treatment, greater than or equal to 25 of the patients reported headache; 4 additional patients dropped out because of severe headache and 2 others because of a coronary event in a washout period.

All patients received nitrates, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, a calcium channel blocker, aspirin and heparin. Pacing thresholds for ischemia and quantitative coronary stenosis were measured before and after infusion of the study medication. Intracoronary thrombus was identified angiographically before infusion of the study medication in 16 patients; 7 received rt-PA and 9 received placebo.

Three types of perturbations were made in guinea pigs: AH perturbation (electrodes inserted and the current was applied), anterior hypothalamic sham (AS) (electrodes placed as in the AH group but no current was passed), and posterior hypothalamic (PH) perturbation (electrodes placed and the current was applied). A control group was sham operated (electrodes not inserted). Eleven days after the operation, guinea pigs receiving brain perturbations and half the control group were sensitized to the antigen ovalbumin. The other half of the control group received vehicle only (nonsensitized). Twenty-five days after this procedure, lungs were perfused in situ, and the outflows were collected before and after injection of antigen. The perfusates were assayed for immunoreactive prostaglandin and histamine, and the lungs were assayed for cAMP, guanosine monophosphate, and histamine. Release of mediators and changes in lung cyclic nucleotides after perfusion with antigen were significantly greater in all the antigen-sensitized compared to the nonsensitized animals. Within the anaphylactic groups, significant reductions in mediators and in cyclic nucleotides were found in the animals with perturbations of the AH region compared to the CO animals. The time course of mediator release was not altered. The results extend to the biochemical level, the observation that the perturbation of the AH region can markedly modify the anaphylactic response, and indicate that this effect may be due to altered release of mediators.\r"

A pair of consensus sequences, X and Y, is found upstream from all class II genes and deletion of each of these sequences eliminates expression of transfected genes. Cells that express Ia demonstrate a coordinate response to lymphokines and other stimuli. These conserved sequences might, therefore, play a role in tissue specificity or lymphokine inducibility of Ia gene expression. The X box sequence of the murine class II A alpha gene diverges much more substantially from the X consensus than does the Y box motif of this gene. We demonstrate that this X box motif is nonetheless recognized by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, as is the more closely conserved Y box. Gel retardation assays and DNase I footprints were compared for a panel of Ia+ and Ia- cells as well as for cells stimulated with the Ia-inducing lymphokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma. The level, retardation pattern and region of DNA contact were comparable in all instances. Thus the availability of active DNA-binding X and Y box factors cannot alone account for the regulation of A alpha expression. To test whether the same set of proteins binds all class II MHC conserved motifs, oligonucleotide probe binding and cross-competition experiments with X box sequences from A alpha, E alpha, and E beta genes were performed. These studies demonstrated A alpha, E alpha, and E beta DNA-protein complexes with unique mobilities and specificities. In addition, all three X box oligonucleotide probes generated one faint complex with an affinity profile of E beta greater than E alpha much greater than A alpha. These three complexes comigrated and thus may represent a communal binding protein. The data are most consistent with the conclusion that multiple proteins bind class II MHC X boxes. For A alpha, the predominant complexes represent different specificities from the predominant E alpha and E beta X box binding proteins.\r"

They establish in addition that in nonproductive H chain loci which bear a DJH rearrangement the frequency of somatic mutations is more than 10 times lower (0.2%) than in VDJH loci expressed by the same cells (2.5%). Thus, the hypermutation mechanism operating in B cell differentiation is targeted at V genes rearranged to the J locus and may require nucleotide sequences associated with both V and J elements in order to be fully activated. An inversion of the JH2 segment was detected in one DJH locus. This inversion appears to be the result of a secondary joining event occurring occasionally in the course of B cell development.\r"

As a result of these studies, experiments were designed to examine the possible immunoregulatory function of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on the in vitro antibody response to the T cell-independent Ag BA-TNP. Our studies demonstrate that TRH at very low concentrations (pM) enhances the in vitro plaque-forming cell response to BA-TNP and also induces splenocyte production of TSH. Other hypothalamic-releasing factors were without effect. This enhancement effect by TRH was specifically blocked by rabbit antisera to the TSH-beta subunit, whereas addition of normal rabbit sera had no effect. These data suggest that TRH specifically enhances the in vitro antibody response via production of immunoreactive TSH.\r"

  ".W": "The fine specificity of anti-HLA-DR1 alloreactive, human T cells was investigated by using DR1-expressing human and murine stimulator cells. All three bulk cell lines and six out of seven T cell clones proliferated in response to DR1-expressing mouse L cells. In addition to these species non specific T cells, three clones were identified which proliferated only in response to DR1 expressed by human or by murine stimulator cells. The patterns of response of these clones may reflect specificity for species or lineage-specific peptides with DR1. The results of aldehyde fixation and cytotoxicity experiments suggested that some of the T cell clones which proliferated in response to human and murine DR1 stimulators also required to recognize species-specific antigens. The responses of four of the six clones were abolished by fixation of DR1-L cells but not of a DR-1 EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line before co-culture. In addition, these clones were also cytotoxic for DR1-expressing human targets. The same clones which failed to recognize fixed L cells also failed to lyse DR1-L cells in a short term chromium release assay. Taken together these results suggest that some alloreactive anti-DR1, T cells are specific for peptides of cellular proteins seen in the context of the allo-MHC molecule. It is envisaged that L cells when co-cultured with human T cells, process and present peptides derived from proteins that are shed or secreted by the human cells, for co-recognition with DR1 on the L cell surface. The presentation of multiple peptides derived from endogenous proteins by allogeneic cells may contribute to the high precursor frequency of allo-reactive T cells.\r"

  ".W": "IFN-gamma-producing (TH1) and IL-4-producing (TH2) clones were assayed for their ability to directly induce cytostatic activity in macrophages generated from splenic myeloid precursors (M phi-c). In the presence, but not in the absence, of antigen, TH1 clones activated the M phi-c to inhibit the growth of P815 tumor cells in vitro. TH2 clones were not able to activate such effector activity in the M phi-c. The M phi-c did effectively present Ag to the TH2 clones as evidenced by the proliferation of TH2 cells cultured with Ag in the presence, but not in the absence, of M phi-c. Therefore, although both TH1 and TH2 were activated by cognate interaction with antigen presenting M phi-c, only TH1:M phi-c interactions displayed reciprocity resulting in activation of the M phi-c. TH1-derived lymphokines or rIFN-gamma, in the presence of LPS, could activate proteose-peptone elicited M phi, resident peritoneal M phi, and M phi-c whereas neither TH2-derived lymphokines nor rIL4 could induce detectable activity in any of the 3 M phi populations. IFN-gamma, in the absence of LPS, could activate the elicited M phi and to a lesser and more variable degree, the resident M phi Only the M phi-c consistently required both IFN-gamma and LPS for induction of cytostatic activity. Since M phi-c consistently required at least two signals for activation, the ability of TH1-derived lymphokines to synergize with TH2 cells in M phi activation was examined. TH2 could activate the Ag-presenting M phi-c in the presence of IFN-gamma. The ability of added IFN-gamma to synergize with TH2 indicates that the cognate interaction between TH2 and antigen presenting M phi-c does result in delivery of at least one of the signal required for M phi activation.\r"

This anabolic effect in hepatoma cells suggested a potential in vivo role of the cytokine in mediating the hepatic response to inflammation. Injection of IL-6 into adult male rats elicited a cytokine-specific change in the liver expression of acute phase proteins. As predicted from in vitro studies, glucocorticoids were needed to achieve a maximal IL-6 response in vivo. Optimal conditions were found to be two i.p. injections of 35 to 120 micrograms IL-6 and 65 micrograms dexamethasone per kg body weight administered at 12-h intervals. Within 24 h, the plasma concentrations for alpha 2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, thiostatin, and hemopexin were increased to levels approximating those observed in acute phase animals. These results support the notion that direct interaction of IL-6 with the liver is an essential part in initiating the hepatic acute phase reaction.\r"

The DP alpha B variant was found in linkage disequilibrium with both DP beta B and DP beta D. Linkage disequilibrium was also encountered with alleles at the DR and DQ loci.

Immunochemical characterization of the hybridoma antibodies showed that 16.4.12E and 36.1.2D had cavity-type combining sites, recognizing the terminal non-reducing end of alpha(1----6)dextran, whereas 28.4.10A and 35.8.2H had groove-type sites, recognizing internal linear segments of the dextran. The V region cDNA of the H and L chains of the antibodies were cloned and sequenced. VH of 16.4.12E and VH of 36.1.2D belonged to the X24 and Q52 germ-line gene families, respectively. The VH and V kappa sequences of 16.4.12E and V kappa sequence of 36.1.2D were highly homologous to those of W3129, the only anti-alpha(1----6)dextran mAb with a cavity-type site thus far sequenced; 16.4.12E differed from W3129 in the D, JH, and J kappa. VH genes of 28.4.10A and 35.8.2H were homologous to those of several anti-alpha(1----6)dextrans with groove-type sites, but belonged to the J558 germ-line gene family, differed from the other J558 anti-alpha(1----6)dextrans, probably representing a different germ-line subfamily. The L chain sequence of 28.4.10A encoded by V kappa-Ars and J kappa 2 was almost identical to other groove-type anti-alpha(1----6)dextrans obtained by immunizing with the T-independent glycolipid Ag, stearyl-isomaltotetraose.

The anti-14C3 antiserum binds only to H chains in immunoblots, therefore suggesting that at least part of the ADC3 determinants may be encoded by H chain V region genes. Analysis of VH gene family usage among the anti-alprenolol mAb reveals that the expression of ADC3 correlates with utilization of VH genes that belong to the J558 gene family, regardless of the JH, Vk, and Jk genes. To determine whether the ADC3 determinants are general V region markers or whether they are unique to anti-alprenolol antibodies, we have extended our analysis to a random panel of antibodies that also use VH genes of the J558 family. Among 23 mAb of various specificities, 14 react with the anti-14C3 antiserum in immunoblot and in ELISA, irrespective of antibody specificity. Adsorption of the antiserum on one of these positive antibodies results in a loss of reactivity toward both anti-alprenolol and unrelated antibodies. Therefore, several but not all antibodies that use a J558 VH gene also express the complete set of epitopes defining ADC3. These results strongly suggest that ADC3 are markers of a subset of J558 VH gene products. The anti-14C3 antiserum may thus constitute a \"serologic probe\" for identification of a VH gene subgroup from the J558 gene family.\r"

In human GEC homologous C cytotoxicity was enhanced by antiserum to decay accelerating factor (DAF) indicating that homologous C activation was, at least in part, restricted by membrane DAF. Anti-DAF immunoprecipitated a 67-kDa protein from human glomeruli. In rat GEC, pronase and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (which are known to inactivate human DAF) enhanced cytotoxicity by homologous C. Thus, DAF is present on human GEC in culture and in human kidney glomeruli, and a DAF-like protein is present on cultured rat GEC.

  ".W": "The utilization of germline genes for the synthesis of autoantibodies has been suspected for many years based on the presence of cross-reactive idiotypes among patients as well as in some healthy first-degree relatives of patients with several autoimmune diseases including SLE. One such system of idiotypes involves anti-Sm antibodies, which are highly specific for SLE. To definitively establish the utilization of germline genes in the Sm system, we produced human-human B cell hybridomas from a patient with SLE who had circulating anti-Sm antibodies. One stable hybridoma designated 4B4 secretes an IgM-kappa mAb that binds Sm and shares idiotypic determinants with other anti-Sm antibodies. A second anti-Sm antibody (3C3), isolated from the same patient was also studied. Oligo(dT) priming was used to produce cDNA corresponding to full length IgM. Sequence analysis revealed that the VH gene segment (1-96) of 4B4 is identical to a VH sequence previously detected in a fetal liver cDNA library by Schroeder and his co-workers as well as a germline VH recently described by Berman and his associates. The identity of a lupus mAb and sequences derived from unrelated individuals provides strong evidence that this autoantibody is a direct copy of a germline gene.\r"

As a result of these studies, the genetic origins of autoantibody H chains and kappa L chains are better understood, but little remains known about the genetic bases of autoantibody lambda-chains. Thus, we have analyzed serologically the germ-line and somatic origins of lambda 1 L chains in antibodies of normal mice and in both antibodies and autoantibodies of autoimmune mice. This study finds an increased lambda 1 diversity in both Ag-stimulated mice and autoimmune mice. This study also finds that the lambda 1 L chains in antibodies of unstimulated normal mice have the gene segment-encoded variable region, V lambda 1. In contrast, additional genetic processes appear to make the lambda 1 V regions of antibodies in Ag-stimulated normal mice and the lambda 1 V regions of both antibodies and autoantibodies in autoimmune mice. The increased lambda 1 diversity that we found in both Ag-stimulated mice and autoimmune mice might be caused by mutational processes creating antibody diversities. Therefore, the same somatic processes might be able to make both antibody and autoantibody lambda 1 diversities.\r"

In order to better examine the hemorrhage-induced alterations in immune function, we determined the effects of blood loss in mice without any surgical manipulation on lymphocyte populations and subpopulations, cellular activation, and lymphokine production. Hemorrhage induced no changes in cell numbers in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. No alterations in the relative percentages of B (B220+, mu+) and T (Lyt-1+, Lyt-2+, T3+, L3T4+) cell subpopulations were found in any organ after blood loss. Significant decreases in splenocyte proliferation in response to Con A, IL-2R expression and blast formation occurred after hemorrhage. IFN-gamma production increased 24 and 48 h post hemorrhage. Decreases in IL-2, IL-3, and IL-5 generation were present 2 h after blood loss. IL-2 production remained significantly decreased for 48 h posthemorrhage, then increased to more than twice normal levels 72 h posthemorrhage, and subsequently returned to prehemorrhage values. These results demonstrate that hemorrhage produces widespread alterations in immune function without affecting lymphocyte population and subpopulation numbers.\r"

  ".W": "Substance P, a potent vasodilatory neuropeptide, is released from peripheral nerve endings of sensory neurons by various stimuli. Although in vitro incubation of rat and human mast cells with substance P causes their degranulation, it is not known whether inflammatory changes induced by substance P are mediated by degranulation of mast cells. We investigated this point by using genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv and WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice. The s.c. injection of substance P induced degranulation of mast cells in the skin of WBB6F1-+/+ mice, and then a marked eosinophil infiltration around the degranulated mast cells. However, WBB6F1-W/Wv and WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice showed little or no eosinophil infiltration in the skin after the injection of substance P. When the mast cell deficiency of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice was rescued either systemically by bone marrow transplantation or locally by injection of cultured mast cells, injection of substance P induced the infiltration of eosinophils, suggesting that substance P-induced eosinophil infiltration was mediated through degranulation of mast cells.\r"

Lymphocytes activated by pep M5 and pep M6 demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cultured heart cells, whereas pep M24-activated cells differentiated into suppressor T cells, which specifically blocked cytotoxic T lymphocytes against cultured human myocardial cells and not NK cell activity against K562 cells. Pep M5 and not pep M24 induced an increase in the number of CD4, 4B4, helper/inducer T cells. In addition, these M proteins appear to induce different biochemical changes in T lymphocytes. Both pep M5 and pep M24 induced the phosphorylation of a 35-kDa cytoplasmic protein; however, only pep M5 induced the phosphorylation of a 28-kDa membrane protein, primarily in CD4 T cells. These data indicate that the virulent M protein Ag of group A streptococci may exert their effect on the human immune system via different mechanisms. Determining these mechanisms and the biochemical pathways involved in T cell differentiation triggered by these Ag may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal diseases.\r"

The T suppressor effector factor (TseF) directly suppresses granuloma formation both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we probe the molecular basis of these TseF properties. Using techniques of heterodimeric chain reduction with DTT and in vitro functional complementation, chimeric molecules were constructed. By analyzing genetic restrictions, antigenic specificities, and phenotypic markers, the contributions of the component chains to 72 kDa TseF reactivity were determined. One chain bore an Ag receptor and imparted antigenic specificity. The other chain bore an IJ determinant, a TCR beta-chain allotypic determinant, a suppressor effector phenotypic determinant, and imparted functional genetic restriction. Functional activity required covalent, probably sulfhydryl mediated, linkage as succinylation prevented the separated component chains from reconstituting functional activity. Additional studies demonstrated that anti-serum directed against either the T cell receptor or the T3 epsilon-chain could abrogate functional activity. However, TseF bore no T3 epsilon-chain phenotypic marker per se suggesting that TseF effects T lymphocytes via transmembrane signal transduction. These studies suggest that a regulatory network is operative in granuloma modulation. This regulatory network is mediated by a soluble TseF that bears significant structural homologies to the classic TCR.\r"

The expression of this multi-gene family is highly regulated and this regulation is essential for the control of the immune response. Class II gene expression is constitutive in a limited number of cell types and can be induced by IFN-gamma in a number of class II negative cells. In this study, we have clarified two essential aspects of the regulation of HLA class II genes by IFN-gamma. 1) The induction mechanism operates at the level of transcription and there is a long lag phase in the signal transduction process. 2) The induction of class II genes requires the de novo synthesis of a new protein(s). On this basis, we propose that IFN-gamma regulates the transcription of HLA class II genes via the de novo synthesis of a trans-acting activator protein.\r"

  ".U": "89110434\r", 
  ".W": "A new operative approach has been designed for the relief of medically intractable focal epilepsy. It is intended particularly to be used in those cases where the epileptogenic lesion lies in \"unresectable\" cortex; that is, those cerebral regions subserving speech, memory, and primary motor and sensory function. The procedure is based upon experimental evidence indicating 1) that epileptogenic discharge requires substantial side-to-side or horizontal interaction of cortical neurons, and 2) that the major functional properties of cortical tissue depend upon the vertical fiber connections of the columnar units. The technique requires severing of tangential intracortical fibers while preserving the vertical fiber connections of both incoming and outgoing nerve pathways and of the penetrating blood vessels which also have a vertical orientation. In this study, the effect of multiple subpial transection was assessed on both function and seizure control. The effect on function was reviewed in 32 cases; only 20 cases were evaluated with respect to seizure control, since a follow-up period of 5 years or more (5 to 22 years) is required before conclusions can be drawn. Multiple subpial transection was applied to the precentral gyrus in 16 cases, the postcentral gyrus in six, Broca's area in five, and Wernicke's area in five. With respect to function, the major finding was that none of the 32 patients has suffered a clinically significant behavioral deficit (although subtle deficits could be detected by careful neurological examination). Complete control of seizures has been obtained in 11 (55%) of the 20 cases evaluated. Nine patients developed recurrent seizures consequent to progressive disease unsuspected before operation (Rasmussen's encephalitis in five, tumor in three, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in one). In none of these cases, however, did the recurrent seizures arise in the transected zone. Thus, the results indicate that multiple subpial transection is about as effective as standard excisional therapy, and can be successfully employed when epileptogenic lesions encroach upon cortical territories, the removal of which would be functionally incapacitating.\r"

The effects of the diets on various iron status parameters were determined and four enzymes were assayed: cytochrome P450 (P450) and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (P450-RED) in liver and intestine microsomes, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PG-DH) in liver, intestine and erythrocyte cytosol. Rats fed 6 mg iron/kg diet were severely anemic, whereas rats fed 18 or 23 mg iron/kg diet were moderately or mildly iron-deficient, as shown by their hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, red blood cell parameters, erythrocyte protoporphyrin and liver iron stores. P450 concentration and P450-RED activity in liver were unaffected by iron deficiency, but P450 concentration was markedly lower in the intestine of the three iron-deficient groups than in the controls. Activities of G6P-DH and 6PG-DH were not impaired in liver or intestine, except that liver 6PG-DH activity of severely anemic rats was less than that of control rats. However, severe and moderate iron deprivation resulted in a stimulation of G6P-DH and 6PG-DH activities per million erythrocytes. These results demonstrate that even moderate iron deficiency may alter fundamental enzymatic systems intervening in drug metabolism and in the pentose phosphate pathway.\r"

The meals were extrinsically labelled with 65Zn and absorption was determined from measurements of the whole-body retention of the isotope. The mean fractional zinc absorption for the 13 meals was 24.7 +/- 6.9% and was only influenced by the protein content of the meal to a limited extent (r = 0.45). However, the amount of zinc absorbed from the meals was strongly correlated with both the protein (r = 0.85) and zinc content (r = 0.86): 5.9 +/- 1.7 mumol of zinc was absorbed from the basal bean meal which had the lowest protein content; the addition of low zinc chicken doubled the protein content and increased zinc absorption to 10.3 +/- 2.0 mumol; the addition of zinc-rich beef also doubled the protein content, however, zinc absorption was increased to 15.9 +/- 4.7 mumol. It is concluded that the zinc content of the main protein source of the diet determines the amount of zinc absorbed to a large extent. However, relatively small amounts of animal protein can significantly improve the value of a legume-based meal as a source of zinc.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence suggest that dietary choline intake influences the metabolism of membrane phospholipids with possible effects on GABAergic neurotransmission. Based on these findings, the present experiments determined whether chronic choline supplementation or deficiency alters GABAergic function at the level of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine-chloride channel complex. To accomplish this, mice were fed diets containing 0% (deficient), 0.2% (basal) or 2.0% (supplemented) choline chloride for 28 days, and behavior, ligand binding at several sites in the complex and chloride uptake were determined in various brain regions. For both rotarod ataxia and open-field activity, mice receiving choline supplementation had a decreased response to clonazepam compared to those receiving basal and deficient diets. Choline supplementation significantly increased the in vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to cortex and cerebellum by 19% and 24%, respectively, and in vitro studies in cortical membranes indicated a significant 36% increase in the maximal number of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites without a change in affinity, as compared to basal controls. In contrast, [3H]Ro15-1788 binding in vivo in all brain regions from mice fed the deficient diet decreased significantly to 20 to 58% of control values. Dietary choline intake did not alter GABA levels in brain, the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the chloride channel or the coupling between GABA and either the t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate site or the benzodiazepine site. However, the function of the GABAA receptor, determined by muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes, was increased significantly in tissue from the supplemented group as compared to both control and deficient groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89110776\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work in anesthetized rats has demonstrated that the sensitivity to cardiotoxic actions of cardiotonic steroids is increased in senescence, and studies in crude homogenates and partially purified membrane preparations have suggested that this altered responsiveness is related to an aging-associated reduction in the sarcolemmal content of Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase. This decrease in Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase could enhance the sensitivity to digitalis-like compounds by reducing the reserve capacity of the Na+-pump and thus the extent of digitalis-induced pump inhibition required before the onset of toxicity. Current experiments examined dose-dependent actions of digoxin in atrial muscle isolated from 3-, 12- and 24- to 25-month-old rats and determined if alterations in responsiveness correlated with changes in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake rate, an estimate of Na+-pump activity. Atrial preparations from aged rats were more sensitive to the cardiotoxic actions of digoxin; however, the inotropic efficacy before the onset of toxicity was not affected by age. Both 1) the maximum attainable ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake rate and 2) the difference between maximum uptake rate and that monitored in preparations stimulated at 4.0 Hz decreased progressively with age. These results indicate that atrial muscle from aged rats is more sensitive to direct toxic effects of digoxin and suggest that this lower tolerance is mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in Na+-pump reserve capacity.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) acts to inhibit neurotransmission in the rabbit vas deferens. The vas deferens is a unique model of autonomic neurotransmission in that it is composed of primarily nonvascular smooth muscle and has both a purinergic or twitch contraction and an adrenergic or phasic contraction associated with its response to electrical stimulation. In this study ANF was found to inhibit both adrenergic and purinergic neurotransmission in the rabbit vas deferens. ANF inhibited both the electrically induced phasic contraction and electrically induced norepinephrine release in a concentration-dependent manner over the ANF concentration range of 10(-10) to 10(-7) M. ANF at a concentration of 10(-7) M had no effect on norepinephrine-induced or ATP-induced contractions. Therefore, the neuromodulatory effect of ANF in the rabbit vas deferens appears to be prejunctional, on the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and ATP from the nerve terminal and not postjunctional on the smooth muscle. Neither the alpha-2 antagonist rauwolscine nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had any effect on the inhibitory effect of ANF on electrically induced twitch or phasic contractions. Additionally, ANF did not affect vasa deferentia prostaglandin E production. Therefore, the inhibitory neuromodulatory ANF effect is not mediated via alpha-2 adrenergic receptors or prostaglandin E production. The observed inhibitory neuromodulatory effects in this study may be involved in the hypotensive effects of ANF including natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilation.\r"

Forskolin, NaF, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine had no effect on basal or DA-1 agonist stimulated phospholipase-C activity in these membranes. These studies indicate that DA-1 agonist stimulates adenylate cyclase and phospholipase-C activities independently. Phospholipase-C activity was also increased by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiophosphate). When DA-1 agonist and guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiophosphate) were added together there was a slight but significant increase in phospholipase-C activity. This increase was inhibited in the presence of guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). DA-1 stimulated phospholipase-C activity was found to be insensitive to both cholera and pertussis toxins. The present studies indicate a cyclic AMP independent transduction pathway for DA-1 receptor mediated through a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein associated phospholipase-C.\r"

The vascular activities of 20-HETE and the two isomers of 19-HETE were examined in rat aortic rings. The HETEs produced concentration-dependent contractions of the aortic rings. The contraction elicited by 20-HETE was abolished partially by removal of endothelium and was inhibited completely by treatment with indomethacin and reversed to a relaxation response by treatment with the endoperoxide and thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29548. These data suggest that the vascular effects of 20-HETE depend on subsequent metabolism by cyclooxygenase.\r"

When other benzodiazepines were tested, they consistently produced greater than 80% of midazolam-appropriate responding. The order of potency for substituting for midazolam was triazolam greater than alprazolam = diazepam = lorazepam greater than midazolam greater than flurazepam = nitrazepam greater than nordiazepam. The barbiturate phenobarbital (10-100 mg/kg) substituted for midazolam in three of four pigeons whereas pentobarbital (1.0-30 mg/kg) substituted in only two of five pigeons. Several nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics were also evaluated. Methaqualone (3.0-56 mg/kg) substituted in only one of four pigeons and meprobamate (30-100 mg/kg) failed to substitute in any pigeon tested. CL 218,872, when administered either i.m. (0.3-30 mg/kg) or p.o. (1.0-56 mg/kg), and buspirone (0.3-30 mg/kg) did not substitute for midazolam. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to midazolam also failed to substitute for midazolam. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 0.03-1.0 mg/kg) antagonized the discriminative stimulus properties of midazolam in a dose-related manner in all pigeons tested. However, this antagonism could not be overcome with increasing doses of midazolam in all pigeons. The results of the present study demonstrate that midazolam is an effective discriminative stimulus in the pigeon. Benzodiazepine anxiolytics, but not other compounds with sedative and/or anxiolytic properties, were found to reliably substitute for midazolam. These results suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam are pharmacologically selective.\r"

We also studied the effects of inhibition of endopeptidase (by phosphoramidon, 10 microM, and thiorphan, 100 microM), and of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (by indomethacin, 5 microM) on these responses. The order of potency of exogenous tachykinins was neurokinin A (NKA) greater than neurokinin B (NKB) greater than substance P (SP). Epithelium removal enhanced the sensitivity and magnitude of the contractile response to SP, and to a lesser extent NKA and NKB. Capsaicin induced only a weak contractile response in guinea pig trachea. Phosphoramidon and thiorphan increased the sensitivity to SP, but had no effect on acetylcholine responses. The leftwardshift due to epithelium removal was reduced, but not abolished, by phosphoramidon and thiorphan. NKA- and NKB-induced contractions were also enhanced significantly by phosphoramidon. The effect of epithelium removal was abolished for NKA, but not for NKB. Phosphoramidon also increased significantly the contraction to capsaicin in the presence of epithelium, without altering the response obtained in the absence of epithelium. Indomethacin potentiated the sensitivity and maximal contractile response to all the tachykinins with the greatest effect on SP responses, and to capsaicin. The combination of indomethacin with phosphoramidon or thiorphan abolished the effect of epithelium removal for all the tachykinins. We conclude that the effects of exogenous and endogenous tachykinins are enhanced by removal of epithelium and by inhibition of metalloendopeptidase and cyclooxygenase, suggesting that tachykinins may be degraded by epithelial enzymes, and may release relaxant prostanoids in airways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

U50,488H a selective kappa agonist, at concentrations between 0.1 to 1 microM, produced an inhibition of 5-HT-release lower than that observed in the presence of mu and delta agonists. The delta antagonist ICI 174,864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr1,Aib2,Aib3)Leu-enkephalin potently inhibited the effect of DPDPE but did not affect the inhibition produced by DAGO. In contrast, the mu-selective antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Nle-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 at 1 microM significantly reversed the inhibitory effect produced by a maximal dose of DAGO (0.1 microM) but not the corresponding effect produced by a maximal dose of DPDPE (1 microM). Naloxone was a competitive antagonist of DAGO but noncompetitive antagonist of DPDPE. Treatment of hippocampal slices with pertussis toxin did not alter the K+-evoked release of 5-HT but abolished the inhibitory effect of both DAGO and DPDPE.\r"

Previous studies based on urinary PG measurements have suggested that p.o. ASA can spare renal cyclooxygenase. We wanted to establish by direct measurement whether p.o. ASA has a renal sparing effect and to establish to which extent changes in renal cyclooxygenase activity can be predicted measuring urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2. Our results showed that in normal rats 10 mg/kg of ASA given p.o. partially inhibits platelet TxA2 formation (measured as serum TxB2) and does not inhibit glomerular and medullary PGI2 and PGE2 synthesis. Higher doses of ASA (30-200 mg/kg) effectively and completely inhibit platelet TxA2 independently if given p.o. or i.v., and also inhibit glomerular and medullary PG synthesis. The kinetics of the effect of ASA on platelet vs. renal cyclooxygenase is different: the inhibition being irreversible in platelets, but rapidly reversible in glomeruli and medulla. Six hours after the administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. and 30 mg/kg p.o., kidney cyclooxygenase activity recovers completely. This transient inhibition of renal cyclooxygenase is not reflected by urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 (6- and 24-hr collection periods). In conclusion our present results indicate that doses of ASA enough to inhibit platelet TxA2, transiently inhibit glomerular and medullary PGI2 and PGE2. Although the inhibitory effect on platelets is long lasting, the effect on renal cyclooxygenase is transient and rapidly reversible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Active sensitization was performed by two injections of 10 micrograms of ovalbumin in 1 mg of AI(OH)3 at a 2-week interval. The i.a. administration of increasing doses (1, 100 and 1000 ng) of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) into isolated perfused lungs from actively sensitized guinea pigs was followed by an enhanced bronchoconstriction as compared to that observed in lungs from nonimmunized animals. PAF-acether stimulation of actively sensitized lungs was accompanied by histamine secretion and by an increased release of leukotriene (LT)-like material (as detected by bioassay using guinea pig tracheal strips superfused with the lung effluent and by a radioimmunoassay for LTC4). Maximal PAF-acether-induced lung responses were observed 7 days after the booster injection of the antigen and remained at a plateau for at least 4 months. Lung response to antigen challenge occurred in parallel with the increase of the level of circulating immunoglobulin G and with the development of hyper-responsiveness up to 7 days after the booster injection. Then, a progressive decrease in the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and mediator release was observed. Lungs from animals in which the booster injection was omitted responded to PAF-acether in a similar fashion as lungs from nonimmunized guinea pigs, even though they underwent anaphylactic reaction upon antigen challenge. Enhanced bronchoconstriction, tracheal contraction, immunoreactive LTC4-like material release, but not histamine secretion were suppressed by BW 755C, a mixed cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The observed enzymuria was associated with significant elevation in total renal phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. In addition, gentamicin decreased the activities of renal cortical Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase, alkaline phosphatase as well as phospholipase C. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (250 mg/kg/day) administered i.p. for 4 or 14 days did not markedly alter the metabolic markers of kidney function. In rats simultaneously given pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and gentamicin for 4 days the vitamin failed to prevent either the antibiotic-induced decrease in renal phospholipase C and alkaline phosphatase or the increase in total renal phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. However, simultaneous pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and aminoglycoside treatment for 2 weeks proved effective in blockade of the gentamicin-induced kidney phospholipidosis, elevation in urinary beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, as well as reduction in renal phospholipase C and alkaline phosphatase. The gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was associated with a decrease in renal pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels. In the simultaneous 4-day-treated rat the renal concentration of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate returned to approximate control values, whereas after 2 weeks the level of vitamin B6 was approximately 2-fold higher than control. Although pyridoxal-5'-phosphate in the simultaneous group lowered kidney gentamicin content by 40% after 4 or 14 days, protection from aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity was apparent only after 2 weeks in our study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The in situ heart is exposed to blood-borne vasoconstrictor agents (e.g., vasopressin) which, if unopposed, may cause radically increased coronary vascular resistance (CVR). Release of endogenous vasodilator, such as prostacyclin (PGI2), is a possible mitigating mechanism. We investigated the ability of the heart to maintain CVR within a narrow range when exposed to exogenous vasoconstrictors. The isolated rat heart was perfused at constant flow rate (5-6 ml/min) with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (37 degrees C, pH 7.4), and was rendered quiescent by a local injection of lidocaine to the atrio-ventricular node. Changes of perfusion pressure, indicating changes of CVR, were monitored and the cardiac effluent was collected for analysis of 6-keto PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (stable metabolites of PGI2 and thromboxane A2, respectively) by radioimmunoassay. Hearts were infused with four different vasoconstrictors (i.e., serotonin, vasopressin, angiotensin II and the thromboxane A2/PGH2 mimetic, U46619). There was a linear relationship between the dose-dependent increase in CVR and PGI2 production in serotonin, U46619 and vasopressin-infused quiescent heart. Vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II was not dose-dependent and was unrelated to PGI2 production. Thus, PGI2 is produced in response to coronary vessel constriction, presumably to mitigate the constriction. No detectable thromboxane B2 was released by any of these vasoconstrictors. Partial inhibition (approximately 50%) of PGI2 production by aspirin (5.6 microM) treatment resulted in a paradoxically decreased vasoconstriction except at the lowest level of serotonin and vasopressin. Aspirin (1 mM) greatly reduced PGI2 production (approximately 90%) but the fall in CVR persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intrathecal pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and 6-hydroxydopamine reduced spinal 5-hydroxytryptamine and NE levels, respectively, but had no effect on adenosine release from dorsal spinal cord synaptosomes evoked by K+ or morphine. NE-evoked release of adenosine was unaffected by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine but increased by 6-hydroxydopamine. Subcutaneous pretreatment of neonatal or intrathecal pretreatment of adult rats with capsaicin increased nociceptive thresholds and reduced the release of adenosine evoked by K+ and morphine but not NE from dorsal spinal cord synaptosomes. Intrathecal capsaicin also inhibited morphine-evoked release of adenosine in vivo. K+ and morphine released only small amounts of adenosine from ventral spinal cord synaptosomes whereas NE released significant amounts. Exposure of dorsal, but not ventral, spinal cord synaptosomes to capsaicin produced a dose- and Ca++-dependent release of adenosine, which was reduced by capsaicin pretreatment (neonatal and adult) and inhibition of ecto-5'-nucleotidase. Capsaicin also released endogenous ATP from dorsal spinal cord synaptosomes. These results suggest that primary afferent nerve terminals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord release adenosine in response to morphine and K+, and a nucleotide (possibly ATP) in response to capsaicin. Adenosine does not appear to be released from the terminals of descending aminergic pathways. The source of purines released by NE is less certain.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oxidant stress on the active transport of serotonin (5-HT) into mouse platelets was examined. Oxidant stress was produced using either H2O2 or the xanthine-xanthine oxidase generating system that yields both superoxide anion and H2O2. H2O2 (6.25-100 microM) caused a rapid (2-4 min) stimulation of platelet 5-HT transport that returned to control levels after 15 min of incubation. Catalase (1500 U/ml) completely prevented the stimulation, and the hydroxyl radical trapping agents mannitol (1 nM) and thiourea (1 mM) failed to alter the stimulation. Fluoxetine (1 microM) totally blocked all 5-HT uptake into stimulated platelets. The xanthine-xanthine oxidase (3.12-25 mU/ml) generating system produced a response similar to that of H2O2. In this system, superoxide dismutase (250 U/ml) did not alter the stimulatory response, whereas catalase (1500 U/ml) totally prevented the stimulation. The kinetics of 5-HT transport showed that oxidant stress did not alter the Km of 5-HT transport (Km control = 8.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(-7) M versus Km H2O2 = 9.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(-7) M) but markedly increased the maximal rate of transport (Vmax control = 36.1 +/- 4.8 pmol/10(8) platelets/4 min versus Vmax H2O2 = 79.9 +/- 9.1 pmol/10(8) platelets/4 min). Washed platelets failed to be stimulated by H2O2; however, the addition of small amounts of plasma to the buffer medium fully restored the stimulating response to H2O2. These data suggest that a plasma factor regulates the active transport of 5-HT by platelets that are oxidatively stressed.\r"

In estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 cells, 17 beta-estradiol stimulated u-PA secretion in a similar fashion on plastic, laminin, fibronectin, or collagen but acted in synergy with laminin in the production and release of tissue-type PA.\r"

We determined the cytotoxicity of methotrexate and the lipid-soluble antifolate trimetrexate to various human carcinoma cells and their doxorubicin-resistant sublines. These multidrug-resistant cells were 17-fold to 26-fold more resistant to trimetrexate but as sensitive to methotrexate as their parental cells. Verapamil and quinidine, which are known to modulate the degree of pleiotropic drug resistance, reversed the cross-resistance to trimetrexate but did not alter methotrexate toxicity in multidrug-resistant cells. By flow cytometry, we show that multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells retained eightfold more fluorescein-methotrexate bound to dihydrofolate reductase upon competition with trimetrexate than the drug-sensitive cells did. However, methotrexate displaced fluorescein-methotrexate equally well in sensitive and multidrug-resistant cells. Furthermore, verapamil produced dose-dependent displacement of fluorescein-methotrexate from the multidrug-resistant cells in the presence of low concentrations of trimetrexate but had no significant effect on displacement of fluorescein-methotrexate from sensitive cells. Hamster cells that overproduce dihydrofolate reductase by 93-fold were 145-fold and 96-fold more resistant to methotrexate and trimetrexate, respectively, than their sensitive parental cells. This form of antifolate resistance was not altered by verapamil or quinidine. We conclude that the cross-resistance to trimetrexate in cells that do not overproduce dihydrofolate reductase is associated with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Possible implications of trimetrexate resistance in cancer chemotherapy are discussed.\r"

Also, its relationship to bilharziasis to the best of our knowledge has never been studied. We attempted to explore these 2 problems by reviewing the files and pathological slides of 25 patients whose diagnosis was proved histopathologically to be xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. We concluded that the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis preoperatively still is difficult. We believe that bilharziasis is an etiologic factor for the disease by increasing the incidence of urinary tract obstruction, infection and stone formation. We plan to study this relationship further by examining the freshly removed kidneys immunohistologically.\r"

  ".W": "Between March 1976 and June 1985, 1,000 consecutive adults with asymptomatic gross or microscopic hematuria in the absence of proteinuria were evaluated urologically. Lesions that could account for the hematuria were detected in 88.3 per cent of the patients. Life-threatening lesions were diagnosed in 9.1 per cent of the patients, while lesions requiring at least observation were present in 22.8 per cent. The incidence of life-threatening lesions increased with age, with a sharp increase after age 50 years. Life-threatening lesions were more common in men (13.6 per cent) than in women (4.9 per cent). In general, as the degree of hematuria increased so did the yield of life-threatening lesions; however, there was no \"safe\" lower limit of hematuria. Of the patients with life-threatening lesions 18.6 per cent had at least 1 urinalysis with less than 3 red blood cells per high power field within 6 months of the diagnosis. The direct medical cost of a hematuria evaluation was $777. The difference in direct medical costs to diagnose and treat localized versus metastatic genitourinary cancer was $48,070 in 3 matched pairs of patients. In this study group 77 of 84 patients (92 per cent) diagnosed with genitourinary cancer had localized disease. A hematuria evaluation was cost-effective for all groups studied. A literature-based estimate of the life-threatening risks of diagnostic studies applied to the study data resulted in a 1.1 per cent life-threatening risk per hematuria evaluation. For all categories studied, except for women less than 40 years old with microscopic hematuria, the risk of a hematuria evaluation was less than the incidence of life-threatening lesions discovered as a result of the evaluation. Asymptomatic hematuria, whether gross or microscopic, is a significant finding and warrants evaluation from a risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness standpoint.\r"

Between September 1985 and September 1987, 26 children with a variety of urological diseases required long-term central venous access, primarily for delivery of chemotherapy and blood products in 13 patients with malignancies, hemodialysis access in 7 undergoing renal transplantation, total parenteral nutrition in 5 (2 of whom were born with cloacal exstrophy), and fluid and antibiotic administration in 1 with dermatomyositis and acute pyelonephritis. Patient age at catheter placement ranged from 1 day to 15 years. A total of 11 complications was encountered during 4,500 catheter days: 10 were mechanical and 1 was infectious in nature. These complications led to replacement of the catheter in 3 patients and the remainder were managed successfully nonoperatively. The surgical techniques involved in placement of these catheters are discussed. The catheters not only allowed many of these patients to receive treatment on an outpatient basis but also ensured their survival. Our favorable experience with prolonged venous access in children should encourage urologists to include these techniques in their armamentarium.\r"

Catheters were placed percutaneously into new sites with or without a cuff and were dressed with polyantibiotic ointment containing polymyxin, neomycin, and bacitracin. Microbial colonization developed in 34.5% of 29 control and 7.7% of 26 cuffed catheters. Catheter-related bloodstream infection occurred with 13.8% of control vs 0% of cuffed catheters. The cuff was not associated with adverse effects. An unexpectedly large proportion (75%) of catheter infections were due to Candida albicans. This may have been due, in part, to the use of polyantibiotic ointment, as suggested by a pooled analysis of previous trials that demonstrated increased Candida colonization of catheters with the ointment, which is not fungicidal. These data suggest that the cuff can reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection among high-risk patients receiving catheter site care with an antibacterial ointment.\r"

Instead of reimbursing hospitals for the actual costs of patient care, the system pays them at fixed rates for each admission. In this study, we estimated the savings to Medicare from the use of prospective payment. We analyzed the expenditure projections published in 10 successive annual reports (1979 to 1988) by the trustees of the federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills for Medicare beneficiaries. To show the effect of prospective payment, these projections were adjusted to correct for the different assumptions about inflation and admissions made in each report. We also examined trends in expenditures from the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, which pays for outpatient services, to see whether the savings in hospital expenses were offset by higher spending for out-of-hospital services. We found that prospective payment has reduced Medicare's hospital costs substantially. Expenditures from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for 1990 are expected to be +12 billion less in 1980 dollars, and +18 billion in 1990 dollars, than was expected shortly before prospective payment went into effect--the equivalent of a savings of approximately 20 percent. By contrast, the effect of prospective payment on the supplementary fund has not been great. We conclude that the prospective payment system is having a major impact on Medicare's hospital expenditures and that the savings is not offset by an increase in outpatient expenditures.\r"

No differences in imputed total expenditures were observed for children assigned to the HMO or any of the fee-for-service plans. Children with cost-sharing fee-for-service plans, however, had fewer medical contacts and received fewer preventive services than those assigned to the HMO. Nonetheless, children with the cost-sharing fee-for-service plans were perceived (by their mothers) to be in better health overall than those assigned to the HMO. No significant differences regarding physiological outcomes (eg, visual acuity, hemoglobin level) were observed between the two groups. The results of this experiment neither strongly support nor indict fee-for-service or prepaid care for children.\r"

The product, which had not been tested for safety prior to marketing, was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in early April. To further investigate the reported associations, the FDA conducted a retrospective cohort study among seven neonatal intensive care units where the product had been used. Standardized abstraction forms were completed for infants admitted to a unit between Nov 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984. Included in the study were 379 infants weighing 2,000 g or less and surviving at least two days; 148 (39%) had been exposed to E-Ferol. Compared with the unexposed infants, the exposed infants were more likely to die and to have ascites, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and a combination of clinical events similar to the syndrome initially reported. We conclude that the use of E-Ferol in these neonatal intensive care units was associated with increased morbidity and mortality among exposed infants.\r"

Data were obtained at rest and during the steady-state phase of alpha-human-(1-28)-atrial natriuretic peptide infusion (0.5 micrograms/kg bolus, 0.05 micrograms/kg/min intravenously for 10 minutes). Mean blood pressure decreased from 105 +/- 3 to 98 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); pressure measurements and left ventricular (LV) angiograms suitable for analysis were available in 7 of 9 subjects at matched heart rate. The ANP infusion reduced LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes from 93 +/- 6 to 80 +/- 6 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01) and from 25 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 1 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05), respectively. The LV ejection fraction increased insignificantly from 72 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 4%. End-systolic pressure/volume ratio showed a slight but not significant increase (from 3 +/- 0.4 to 4 +/- 0.8). Initial plasma levels of ANP (48 +/- 12 pg/ml) increased to 1,890 +/- 423 pg/ml (p less than 0.001) during the infusion and individual hemodynamic responses were not related to plasma ANP concentrations. These data suggest that the administration of ANP has no negative effects on LV function and the ANP-induced changes on cardiac performance are related to the reduced cardiac load.\r"

  ".U": "89116341\r", 
  ".W": "Most Hodgkin's mononuclear cells and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells are characterized by the expression of the antigen CD30, but not of T or B cell markers. A few H-RS cells, however, may express a limited number of T or B cell markers. Whether this expression is sufficient to allow the conclusion that H-RS cells are derived from T and/or B cells has been debated vigorously. The present study examined whether CD30 and aberrant T and B cell markers are expressed in cell lines that are well documented as being derived from the granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte lineage. These cells included HL-60, KG-1, ML-1, THP-1, and U-937. Four other cell lines derived from patients with leukemias/lymphomas of monocytic or granulocytic origins also were studied. These cells included BV173, CML-Brown, CTV-2, and SU-DHL-1. If aberrant expression is detected, by analogy one may expect that rare T or B cell marker expression may occur in H-RS cells, because abundant evidence has indicated that H-RS cells may be related to cells in histiocyte lineage. In all nine of the cell lines studied, it was confirmed that numerous monocyte/granulocyte markers were expressed. The marker expression was enhanced after cells were induced to differentiate with phorbol ester (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It was noted that several T and B cell markers also were expressed by these cells. Unlike the expression of monocyte/granulocyte markers, the expression of T or B cell markers was not affected, or only minimally affected, by treatment of the cells with TPA or TNF. Five of the cell lines (BV173, CML-Brown, CTV-2, SU-DHL-1, and THP-1) were shown to be CD30-positive. In CTV-2 and BV173, the expression of CD30 was greatly increased after induction with phorbol ester or TNF. Based on these studies, the following conclusions were reached: 1) The expression of aberrant B or T cell markers is not an uncommon finding in granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte-related neoplastic cells. 2) The expression of granulocyte/monocyte markers in these cells is related to the state of cell differentiation, whereas the expression of T or B cell markers is not. 3) CD30 is not necessarily a proliferation-related antigen, and its expression is not a sole property of T or B cells, but can be present in granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte-related cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and LPS not only enhanced the accumulation of c-sis mRNA, but also induced IL-1 beta gene expression. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), in contrast, suppressed the accumulation of c-sis mRNA profoundly and PDGF-A chain mRNA to a lesser extent. The cytokine, in addition, suppressed the release of PDGF-like proteins by EC, while maintaining the growth of EC. IFN-gamma, however, augmented the levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in cultured EC in association with LPS or IL-1, suggesting that the suppression of c-sis expression was not mediated through modulation of IL-1 gene expression by IFN-gamma. These results raise the possibility that IFN-gamma may play a novel regulatory role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and vasculitis.\r"

By Northern blot analysis, the increase in Ia surface determinants correlates with an increased steady-state level of class II mRNA for both I-A and I-E. Ia expression on PT starts focally at around 2-months of age, often in proximity to vascular infiltrates, and precedes overt glomerulo-nephritis and proteinuria. Enhanced class II expression is not restricted to the kidney. MRL/lpr have also increased interstitial class II antigen expression in liver, lung, and spleen compared with normal C3H/FeJ mice. Thus, MRL/lpr mice have enhanced systemic Ia expression, but Ia antigen expression is particularly prominent in PT and may play a key role in the initiation and progression of lupus nephritis.\r"

All patients were given midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and etomidate 0.3 mg/kg followed by 8 mg of vecuronium to facilitate intubation. After nasotracheal intubation the patients were mechanically ventilated with an Erica Engstrom ventilator and connected to an Engstrom metabolic computer (EMC). Carbon dioxide production was measured using an infrared CO2 analyzer. Resting energy expenditure was calculated by the EMC, which incorporated an oxygen cell for VO2 measurement. VO2, VCO2, and REE were recorded 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after intubation. High values of the above parameters were observed 5 minutes after intubation, values that gradually declined during the next 25 minutes. At 25 and 30 minutes after intubation VO2 was 25% and 27% lower (P = 0.054) than the VO2 at 5 minutes after intubation. Carbon dioxide production and REE were also lower 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after intubation but were not significantly different from values obtained at 5 minutes. The increase in VO2 associated with nasotracheal intubation may be detrimental for patients already suffering from hypoxia.\r"

In each patient, CBF was determined at baseline and then again following SNP-induced reduction of MAP. Two groups were studied. In Group I (n = 9), PaCO2 was maintained near 42 mm Hg uncorrected for nasopharyngeal temperature (NPT). In Group II (n = 8), PaCO2 was maintained near 60 mm Hg, uncorrected for NPT. Nasopharyngeal temperature, MAP, pump oxygenator flow, PaO2, and hematocrit were maintained within a narrow range in each patient during both studies. Since the baseline CBF determinations were conducted at the higher MAP in all subjects, we corrected post-SNP CBF data for the spontaneous decline that occurs over time during CPB. In Group I, a reduction in MAP from 76 +/- 9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 50 +/- 6 mm Hg was associated with a reduction in CBF from 17 +/- 5 to 13 +/- 3 ml.100 g.min-1 (P less than 0.01), a decrease that became statistically insignificant once the time correction factor had been applied (16 +/- 4 ml.100 g-1.min-1). In Group II, MAP declined from 75 +/- 5 mm Hg to 54 +/- 5 mm Hg, and CBF declined from 25 +/- 10 to 17 +/- 7 ml.100 g.min-1 (P less than 0.01), but, again, after time correction, the CBF decline was statistically insignificant (22 +/- 8 ml.100 g-1.min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, during neurosurgical procedures, N2O is almost always given in combination with either volatile or intravenous agents, and generally after the institution of some degree of hypocarbia. Unfortunately, the modifying influence of such interventions are not well known, and, therefore, the cerebral effects of 70% N2O were studied in rabbits anesthetized with either 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane, or with a fentanyl/pentobarbital combination, during both normocarbia (PaCO2 approximately 40 mm Hg) and hypocarbia (PaCO2 approximately 20 mm Hg). Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBFc) and sagittal sinus blood flow (CBFss--as an index of \"global\" forebrain flow) were measured using the hydrogen clearance method. Cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was calculated, and intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the EEG were also recorded. CBFc during normocarbic halothane, isoflurane, and fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthesia was 69 +/- 23, 41 +/- 16, 53 +/- 26 ml.100g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SD) respectively, with a significant difference between halothane and isoflurane. The addition of 70% N2O to all three anesthetics significantly increased CBFc by 32%, 34% and 36% respectively during normocarbia and by 47%, 65% and 27% during hypocarbia. A similar pattern was seen for CBFss. There were no significant differences in the response to N2O based either on anesthetic or PaCO2, except that the increase in CBFss produced by N2O during normocarbic fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthesia (10%) was less than that noted during normocarbic halothane anesthesia (39%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Linear regression analysis for the group as a whole showed significant correlations between iBE and stroke index (SI), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PCW), and right atrial pressure (RAP), but not mean arterial pressure (MAP). Two patient subgroups were identified (P less than 0.001 by F-test): those with low SI and high iBE, or those with high SI and low iBE (cutoffs at 40 ml/m2 and 35 pg/ml, respectively). Correlations between hemodynamics and iBE were always stronger within the low-SI than the high-SI subgroups. These correlations were greater for patients with coronary artery than with valvular heart disease. Cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) correlated with iBE in valve-replacement and coronary-grafting groups. These findings were not an artifact of impaired iBE clearance due to renal dysfunction. Our results quantitate the importance of hemodynamic dysfunction for iBE secretion, and indicate that this relationship is particularly strong when stroke index declines below 40 ml/m2.\r"

Eighteen children were acyanotic; 9 with normal pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and normal intracardiac anatomy (normal group); and 9 with increased PBF (acyanotic group). Twenty-three children were cyanotic; 14 with right to left intracardiac shunts and decreased PBF (cyanotic (D) group); and 9 with mixing lesions with normal or increased PBF (cyanotic (I) group). Correlations between PaCO2 and PETCO2 in the four groups of children were carried out and the relationship of delta PCO2 to VD/VT and Qs/Qt was determined. PETCO2 correlated closely with the PaCO2 in the normal and acyanotic groups (r2 = 0.97 and 0.91, respectively) and the lines of regression for the relationship between PaCO2 and PETCO2 for both groups did not differ from the line of identity (P less than or equal to 0.05).

The relationship of delta PCO2 to VD/VT and Qs/Qt demonstrated that VD/VT was the most important determinant of delta PCO2, but in instances where Qs/Qt were large (e.g., cyanotic congenital heart disease) the percentage contribution of Qs/Qt to the delta PCO2 can be considerable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CBF and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) were determined during both normocapnia and hypocapnia (PaCO2 21-22 mmHg) at control cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and after reducing CPP (by hemorrhage) to 80%, 60%, 50%, and 40% of control. At control CPP hypocapnia decreased CBF from 75 +/- 5 to 48 +/- 3 ml.100 g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05). During both normocapnia and hypocapnia CVR decreased and CBF did not change as CPP was reduced to 60% of control. When CPP was reduced to 50% or 40% of control, CVR remained decreased and CBF fell sharply. The LLA during hypocapnia, 61 +/- 2% of control CPP, was not different than that during normocapnia, 59 +/- 3% of control CPP. Below the LLA the CBF-CPP slopes differed from zero but did not differ between hypocapnia and normocapnia. Hypocapnia does not produce a substantial shift of the LLA, and over the range of CPP values studied here, autoregulatory cerebral vasodilation only partially abolishes hypocapnia-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. The results suggest that when cerebral autoregulation is intact and in the absence of cerebrovascular disease, hypocapnia does not reduce global CBF to a level that is likely to produce ischemia and remains a useful therapeutic treatment so long as CPP remains above the LLA.\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMRglc) were measured simultaneously in the same animal subjected to hypocapnia or hypocapnia combined with induced arterial hypotension. The rCMRglc was measured with (3H) deoxyglucose and the rCBF with (14C) iodoantipyrine with the use of tissue biopsy methods and scintillation counting. Nineteen male Wistar rats were anesthetized with halothane and artificially ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen (70:30) and succinylcholine. Six rats were maintained at normocapnia, six rats were ventilated to a PaCO2 of 20 mmHg, and seven animals were ventilated to PaCO2 20 mmHg combined with arterial hypotension of 50 mmHg (mean blood pressure) induced by infusion of adenosine. Although hypocapnia alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease of rCBF except in hippocampus, hypocapnia combined with hypotension resulted in a significant reduction of rCBF in four of seven regions when compared with hypocapnia alone; rCMRglc values were unchanged during hypocapnia. However, the addition of hypotension induced by adenosine led to a significant decline of glucose utilization in five of seven brain regions. In the present study the authors observed no increase of regional glucose utilization and hence no signs of cerebral ischemia during hypocapnia alone or combined with hypotension induced by adenosine.\r"

The mechanical deformation of the cell surface induced a rapid, but transient, increase in ciliary beat frequency. In addition, the beat frequency of these ciliated cells was also increased in a dose-dependent manner by the beta-adrenergic drug isoproterenol (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) and by the calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-6) and 10(-5) M). To determine if drug and mechanosensitive activation of ciliary beat frequency arise from a common or different cellular mechanism, we investigated the effect of mechanical stimulation on beat frequency in the presence of isoproterenol or A23187. In isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-4) M), none of the parameters used to describe the ciliary beat frequency response to mechanical stimulation was altered. In A23187 (10(-6) M or above), the magnitude of the beat frequency response was significantly reduced or almost abolished, suggesting that mechanical stimulation acts, like A23187, to increase ciliary beat frequency by increasing intracellular calcium. Lower concentrations of A23187 had no effect. These results suggest that respiratory tract ciliated cells have at least two independent mechanisms for the control of ciliary beat frequency: one probably utilizing calcium, the other probably cAMP.\r"

In subsequent time-course studies, the bronchoconstrictor response to inhalation of the PC20 histamine was suppressed completely by terfenadine and the drug combination, but unaffected by flurbiprofen. Terfenadine alone and flurbiprofen alone inhibited bronchoconstriction provoked by the PC20 AMP by 49.8 +/- 5.5% (p less than 0.01) and 31.9 +/- 7.9% (p less than 0.01), respectively, when areas under the FEV1 time curves were compared with placebo, the difference between the two treatments not being significant (p = 0.06). The drug combination inhibited the response to AMP by 60.0 +/- 8.3% (p less than 0.01), this being significantly greater than with flurbiprofen (p less than 0.01), but not with terfenadine alone. These data implicate both histamine and cyclooxygenase products in the bronchoconstrictor response to AMP.\r"

Because it is ineffective at neutral pH in vitro, it is thought to owe its in vivo activity at least partly to acting upon tubercle bacilli (TB) in the helpfully low pH of macrophage (MP) phagolysosomes. However, when it was tested in TB-infected cultured human MP, it was not bactericidal and was able only to slow intra-MP bacillary growth. Recent evidence has suggested that human MP need hormonal support from certain vitamin D metabolites to resist TB. This support was not provided in the culture medium of the earlier experiments in which the PZA was relatively ineffective. Here, PZA has been retested in MP cultured in medium supplemented with the hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25D3). The MP were infected with virulent TB and incubated in various concentrations of PZA. 1,25D3 was added to postinfection medium at 4 micrograms/ml. Inhibition or killing of intracellular TB was quantitated by counts of culturable TB from samples of lysed MP taken at zero, 4, and 7 days after MP infection. Previous evidence for the protectiveness of 1,25D3 alone for human MP against TB was confirmed. The weak inhibition of TB in MP by PZA alone also was confirmed. The two used together synergized to decrease concentrations of PZA which were inhibitory and to switch the action of PZA from weakly inhibitory to bacteriostatic or mildly bactericidal. 1,25D3 had no direct anti-TB effect, and it did not synergize with PZA in the absence of MP, as determined with acidified bacteriologic culture medium in the BACTEC radiometric system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is an acute infectious illness characterized by fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. Research over the last 40 years has led to the discovery and characterization of the causative viruses, detailed knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease, development of sensitive diagnostic assays, and improvements in patient management, which in turn have led to significant reductions in mortality. Considerable progress has also been made in elucidating the pathophysiology of the disease, although much more needs to be learned. Recent data show that hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome has a wider geographic occurrence than previously thought. This syndrome must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure of unknown cause.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind, random assignment, six-week comparison of desipramine hydrochloride (n = 24), lithium carbonate (n = 24), and placebo (n = 24) treatments for cocaine dependence. Subjects were 72 outpatient cocaine abusers who met DSM-III-R dependence criteria for cocaine but not for other substance abuse. Subjects in each treatment group were similar in history of cocaine and other substance abuse, cocaine craving, sociodemographics, and other psychiatric comorbidity. Desipramine, compared with both other treatments, substantially decreased cocaine use. Lithium treatment outcome did not differ from that of placebo. Desipramine-treated subjects attained contiguous periods of abstinence substantially more frequently than subjects receiving lithium or placebo. Fifty-nine percent of the desipramine-treated subjects were abstinent for at least three to four consecutive weeks during the six-week study period, compared with 17% for placebo and 25% for lithium. Cocaine craving reductions were also substantially greater in the desipramine-treated subjects. Establishment of initial abstinence is the first stage in recovery from cocaine dependence. Our findings indicate that desipramine is an effective general treatment, for this first treatment stage, in actively cocaine-dependent outpatients.\r"

  ".W": "The current study tested the notion that a sense of control can mitigate anxiety and panic attacks caused by the inhalation of 5.5% carbon dioxide (CO2)-enriched air. Twenty patients with panic disorder inhaled a mixture of 5.5% CO2-enriched air for 15 minutes. All patients were instructed that illumination of a light directly in front of them would signal that they could decrease the amount of CO2 that they were receiving, if desired, by turning a dial attached to their chair. For ten patients, the light was illuminated during the entire administration of CO2. For the remaining ten patients, the light was never illuminated. In fact, all patients experienced the full CO2 mixture, and the dial was ineffective. When compared with patients who believed they had control, patients who believed they could not control the CO2 administration (1) reported a greater number of DSM-III-revised panic attack symptoms, (2) rated the symptoms as more intense, (3) reported greater subjective anxiety, (4) reported a greater number of catastrophic cognitions, (5) reported a greater resemblance of the overall inhalation experience to a naturally occurring panic attack, and (6) were significantly more likely to report panic attacks. These data illustrate the contribution of psychologic factors to laboratory induction of panic attacks through inhalation of 5.5% CO2-enriched air.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is vasodilatory and natriuretic, but whereas increased plasma ANP levels occur in spontaneously hypertensive rats, their elevated vascular resistance suggests inappropriate target tissue responsiveness to ANP. This study examines ANP-receptor binding properties (at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C) in cultured vascular aortic smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. [I125]-human ANP saturation (0.0625-12.0 nmol) profiles were analyzed using nonlinear regression (LIGAND). Vascular smooth muscle cells from WKY possessed both high affinity (KD1 0.3 nmol; R1 33 fmol/10(5) cells) and low affinity (KD2 15 nmol; R2 400 fmol/10(5) cells) binding sites for ANP. In contrast, for smooth muscle cells from SHR, two receptor forms could not be resolved using identical analytical protocols. Parameter estimates at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C were not different for either SHR or WKY. The number of receptors for SHR (Bmax approximately 100 fmol/10(5) cells) was lower than the total number of receptors for WKY (high plus low affinity approximately 430 fmol/10(5) cells). The intermediary KD value (approximately 1.0 nmol) for ANP binding in SHR suggests an ANP-receptor interconversion from high affinity to low affinity in smooth muscle cells from SHR. Competition-binding experiments also revealed a decreased affinity for ANP in SHR-derived smooth muscle cells. The cyclic GMP response (intracellular accumulation and extracellular levels) was decreased in SHR smooth muscle cells compared to WKY, although this difference was evident only after prolonged (one hour) stimulation with ANP. Our data indicate a reduced sustained vascular responsiveness to ANP in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients with anal canal cancers were treated with surgery and irradiation or irradiation alone during the period 1970-1982. All cases were treated by external megavoltage equipment. The overall 5-year survival was 50%, and the local recurrence rate 33%. According to the therapy, four major groups were analysed: radical surgery followed by post-operative irradiation (5-year survival 43%, local recurrence rate 38%), incomplete major surgery and post-operative irradiation with very inferior prognosis (none of the patients surviving beyond 52 months). Two groups of patients had sphincter-saving procedures: local surgery followed by irradiation (5-year survival 78%, local recurrence rate 22%) and primary irradiation (5-year survival 57%, local recurrence rate 14%). Lymph node positive patients showed a median survival of 24.5 months against 52 months in N0 cases (5-year survival 21% against 50%). Side-effects of radiotherapy were transient and mild, and no late severe sequelae were seen. The data indicate that post-operative external radiotherapy seems insufficient and unable to decrease the local recurrence rate, especially when surgery is incomplete. Both spincter-saving surgery and radiotherapy, as well as primary irradiation, are effective treatment modalities. These data are analysed and future aspects considering combined radiochemotherapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The replacement of old radiologic contrast media with supposedly safer but more expensive media has created a dilemma for radiologists and hospital administrators. To quantitate the nature of this trade-off we performed a cost-utility analysis using optimistic assumptions that favoured the new media. A complete conversion to the new media would result in an incremental cost of at least $65,000 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). For a selective strategy in which only high-risk patients would receive the new media the cost would be about $23,000 per QALY gained. However, the incremental cost for low-risk patients is over $220,000 per QALY gained. Conversion to the new contrast media, although not necessarily the most efficient use of scarce resources, has already occurred in Ontario, primarily because of press publicity, pressure from insurers and a political unwillingness of policymakers to decide the fate of identifiable victims. We found that funding of a new intervention associated with a high cost-utility ratio rather than interventions with lower ratios might save some identifiable victims at the expense of a larger number of unidentifiable ones.\r"
