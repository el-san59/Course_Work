  ".W": "Disaggregated chick osteoclasts sedimented onto bovine cortical bone slices excavate deep and sharply defined resorption lacunae that stain intensely with toluidine blue. We have used this observation to develop a simple light microscopic method for quantifying the bone resorptive activity of chick osteoclasts in vitro. Using this technique, we have found that disaggregated chick osteoclasts are strikingly less sensitive than rat osteoclasts to salmon calcitonin (sCT). Bone resorption by rat osteoclasts was completely abolished by synthetic sCT at a concentration of 10 pg/ml. In contrast, sCT at concentrations up to 100 micrograms/ml did not significantly inhibit bone resorption by chick osteoclasts. Bone resorption by chick osteoclasts could, however, be inhibited by prostaglandin E2 at concentrations of 10(-6) M or more. In time-lapse video experiments, the motility of rat osteoclasts was rapidly inhibited by sCT (5-50 pg/ml), prostaglandins I2 and E2 (less than or equal to 10(-4) M), and Bu2cAMP (2.5 X 10(-4) M), whereas chick osteoclasts failed to show such a response. These findings suggest that CT does not play an important role in the regulation of osteoclastic activity in the chick and may explain why injection of the hormone has generally not been found to evoke an acute hypocalcemic response in birds. This fundamental difference in response to CT may limit the utility of chick osteoclast systems as models of mammalian bone resorption.\r"

Plasma membranes were isolated from liver homogenates of animals after 0, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h of fasting. The changes observed in body weight, liver weight, plasma glucose, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate during the fast were consistent with those previously reported for a similar fasted rat model. During the transition from the fed to the fasted state there was a decrease in hepatic PGE receptor density (from 0.175 +/- 0.011 pmol bound/mg membrane membrane protein in fed rats to 0.060 +/- 0.009 in rats fasted for 24 h), with no change in binding affinity. This change was observed whether the data were expressed per mg membrane protein isolated or were corrected for total membrane recovery and normalized to initial body weight. Isolated hepatocytes prepared from fed and 24-h fasted animals also demonstrated a significant decrease in PGE-binding site density (from 0.98 +/- 0.05 pmol bound/10(6) cells in fed rats to 0.46 +/- 0.14 in fasted rats), with no change in binding site affinity. The change in binding site density in the hepatocytes was of a magnitude similar to that observed in the liver plasma membranes after the membranes were corrected for recovery and normalized to initial body weight (51% vs. 53%, liver plasma membranes vs. isolated hepatocytes). We conclude that fasting is associated with a decrease in the hepatic PGE receptor density and suggest that this decrease may reflect an increase in hepatic E-series PGs during starvation.\r"

Gastric mucosa was obtained at endoscopy. Synthesis of iPE2 and iTxB2 was inhibited in vitro by indomethacin; iTxB2 synthesis was also selectively inhibited by the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegrel. Prostaglandin catabolism was inhibited by carbenoxolone. Multivariate analysis showed that synthesis of iPGE2 from endogenous precursor during homogenisation was decreased in patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Mucosal inflammation was associated with significantly increased synthesis of iPGE2 and decreased prostaglandin catabolism. There were no differences between the mucosa of patients with or without gastric ulcers, nor between the ulcer rim and mucosa 5 cm away. Age, sex, smoking history and ingestion of antisecretory drugs appeared to exert no influence. In this study gastritis was the major influence on prostaglandin synthesis. It seems unlikely that prostaglandin deficiency is a strong predisposing factor for gastric ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "This paper demonstrates that in the presence of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 100% of the mice died when infected with live Listeria, whereas none of the animals died in the absence of the drug. The death of the animals correlated with the numbers of bacteria found extraperitoneally in the spleen and not with the Ia expression of the peritoneal macrophages. Increases in the spleen bacterial numbers between mice treated with either indomethacin or a specific thromboxane synthase inhibitor, OKY1581, and those not receiving either drug, were found as early as 2-4 h after infection. The differences in the initial increased bacterial spleen counts in the presence of indomethacin were reversed by administration of a stable thromboxane A2 analog or another potent vasoconstrictor, phenylephrine. Because thromboxane A2 does not regulate macrophage or T cell functions directly (Tripp, C.S., A. Wyche, E.R. Unanue, and P. Needleman, 1986, J. Immunol., In press; and Ceuppens, J.S., S. Vertessen, H. Deckmyn, and J. Vermylen, 1985, Cell Immunol., 90:458-463), but is probably generated at the site of an infection (Tripp, C.S., K.M. Leahy, and P. Needleman, 1985, J. Clin. Invest., 76:898-901), these data suggest an important role for the vasoconstrictive properties of thromboxane A2 in the regulation of immunity to Listeria infection.\r"

We have now determined that these Y' binders are 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3 alpha-HSD), bile acid-metabolizing enzymes. 3 alpha-HSD activity copurified with lithocholic acid-binding activity after sequential gel filtration, chromatofocusing, and affinity chromatography. Three peaks of 3 alpha-HSD activity (I, II, III) were observed in chromatofocusing and all were identified on Western blot by a specific Y' binder antiserum. 3 alpha-HSD-I, the predominant form, was purified and functioned best as a reductase at pH 7.0 with a marked preference for NADPH. Michaelis constant values for mono- and dihydroxy bile acids were 1-2 microM, and cholic acid competitively inhibited the reduction of 3-oxo-cholic acid. Under normal redox conditions, partially purified 3 alpha-HSD-I and freshly isolated hepatocytes catalyzed the rapid reduction of 3-oxo-cholic to cholic acid without formation of isocholic acid, whereas the reverse reaction was negligible. The Y' bile acid binders are therefore 3 alpha-HSD, which preferentially and stereospecifically catalyze the reduction of 3-oxo-bile acids to 3 alpha-hydroxy bile acids.\r"

It appears that the primary preventive measure is to maintain a high standard of oral hygiene and the elimination of gingival irritation. As stated by Tyldesley and Rotter, because the structures of the three drugs are different, the gingival changes may result from a metabolic by-product rather than the drugs themselves. Similarly acting metabolites of all the drugs may be involved. Further laboratory investigations and controlled clinical trials are needed for more understanding of this phenomenon.\r"

We report here that in various human tumor cells TNF-alpha upregulates constitutively expressed HLA genes. Further, in a priori HLA-negative tumor cells, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class I and class II HLA gene expression. In vitro transcription, Northern blot, and immunofluorescence analysis performed with the leukemic cell line K 562 reveal that TNF-alpha reversibly enhances IFN-gamma-induced HLA gene expression at the level of mRNA transcription. In addition, a posttranscriptional regulation of HLA gene expression by TNF-alpha is suggested from enhancement of HLA class I membrane expression in Colo 205 cells without measurable changes in steady state mRNA levels. Therefore, it is conceivable that TNF-alpha, similar to IFN-gamma, might provoke tumor rejection not only via direct tumoricidal action but also via enhancement of HLA antigens and induction of tumor-specific immune responses.\r"

Although the role of the Ii chain in the expression of cell surface Ia molecules is unclear, it has been suggested that the Ii chain helps in the assembly and intracellular transport of class II antigens. In this study, we demonstrate that the murine polymorphic class II antigens of an interspecies mouse-human hybrid, which has segregated the murine invariant chain gene, associates with the human invariant chain gene intracytoplasmically. The murine Ia antigens are expressed on the cell surface and can function as restriction elements in antigen presentation to T cells. The biochemical analysis demonstrates that the regions of the Ii gene that are critical to its interaction with Ia molecules are conserved between species.\r"

  ".W": "The release of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and histamine induced by antigen and compound 48/80 was studied using an in vitro model of anaphylaxis in guinea pig skin. Abdominal skin from ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs was cut into 0.5-1.0 mm-thick slices which were incubated in Tyrode solution at 37 degrees C with or without either ovalbumin or 48/80. Released PGD2 and PGE2 were measured by radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Release of PGD2 was detectable at 2 min after challenge (50 micrograms/ml ovalbumin), reaching a maximum at about 15 min. Histamine release was more rapid, achieving 50% of maximum at about 4 min compared to about 7 min for PGD2. In 11 experiments incubation with ovalbumin (50 micrograms/ml for 10 min) induced a significant 6-fold increase in PGD2 compared to unchallenged controls (399 +/- 53 and 67 +/- 19 ng/g dry weight skin, respectively; mean +/- SEM) and a net 47.2% histamine release. In contrast, a smaller (27%) rise in PGE2 was found. Indomethacin (14 microns) completely suppressed evoked PGD2 and PGE2 synthesis without evident effect on histamine release, suggesting that the release of histamine in this model is not dependent on prostaglandin production. The mast cell degranulating agent compound 48/80 (50 micrograms/ml) released significant amounts of PGD2 (340 +/- 86 ng/g skin compared to 89 +/- 30 ng/g for control skin, n = 5) but had no appreciable effect on PGE2. These results show that guinea pig skin can synthesize significant quantities of PGD2 in anaphylactic reactions. Prostaglandin D2 produced in acute allergic reactions in skin in vivo may contribute to the inflammatory reaction, either directly or in synergism with other mediators.\r"

Nine patients had hypopyon, and two had iris involvement only. Concomitant testicular relapse was present in two children and hematologic relapse in one. Ocular relapse occurred at 12 to 74 months (median, 36 months) from the data of initial diagnosis. Children who relapsed after therapy was discontinued did so within 1 year of completing therapy. Topical steroids and systemic chemotherapy were administered to all patients with ocular relapse; four also received radiation to the involved eye (600 to 1,050 cGy). Four children, each with a prolonged initial complete remission, remain free of disease for 15+, 32+, 34+, and 145+ months following anterior chamber relapse; three had received radiation therapy. Five patients died of recurrent leukemia, and two of infection while in remission. Aggressive retreatment appears warranted in cases of anterior chamber relapse of ALL, as some of these children may attain prolonged new remissions.\r"

Reserpine also enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of ACNU in C6/ACNU-bearing (C6/ACNU-meningeal gliomatosis) rats, in which ACNU resistance could be modulated by combined ACNU and reserpine therapy. When 10 microM reserpine was added to ACNU in culture, the concentration of drug required for 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) of ACNU for C6/ACNU cells decreased to the level of that for C6 cells. When 20 microM reserpine was added to the culture, intracellular uptake of ACNU in C6/ACNU cells increased further and the efflux of the drug from the cells decreased. In in vivo experiments in rats, combined chemotherapy with ACNU (1 mg/kg) and reserpine (250 micrograms/kg) by intrathecal injection significantly increased the life span of the rats as compared to results with ACNU chemotherapy alone. The enhanced cytotoxicity of ACNU in ACNU-resistant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo may be explained by the increase of intracellular concentration of ACNU resulting from the inhibition of ACNU efflux from the resistant cells by reserpine. It was concluded that ACNU resistance could be modulated in vitro and in vivo by combined therapy with ACNU and reserpine.\r"

This paper outlines the distinguishing features of Binder's syndrome, the treatment considerations, and presents 24 patients seen and treated. The facial and skeletal characteristics and developmental findings are emphasized to affirm the diagnosis of Binder's syndrome. A familial finding of Binder's features in five patients raises the possibility of a genetic mechanism, a previously undisclosed finding.\r"

Six adolescent female Macaca fascicularis monkeys were randomly divided into two surgical groups, and eight others served control. Prior to surgery, metallic implants were inserted in the anterior part of the cranial base, on opposite sides of craniofacial sutures, and in multiple sites of the maxilla and mandible. Group I animals underwent a Le Fort I advancement of 4 mm, while Group II animals had a 5-mm advancement and a 2.5-mm impaction. Lateral cephalometric head-films were taken at monthly intervals for a total follow-up of 12 months after surgery. At least two cephalograms were taken on each occasion, one with the teeth in occlusion and the other with the mouth wide open. The latter was used to ascertain accurately the outline of the mandibular condyle. Cephalometric superimposition methods were used to quantify the growth changes. The findings indicated that the growth changes in the maxilla and mandible were related to the extent of injury caused by maxillary surgery. The largest increments and rates of growth were observed respectively in the control animals, Group I animals (anterior maxillary repositioning), and Group II animals (anterior and superior maxillary repositioning). The most interesting finding was that mandibular growth pattern followed maxillary growth pattern in both experimental groups, and the immediate postsurgical occlusion in Class II molar relationship was maintained with increased overjet in both experimental groups throughout the postsurgical observation period.\r"

Forty-five patients undergoing surgical removal of impacted third molar teeth under local anesthesia were randomly allocated to the four treatment regimens under double-blind conditions. The first oral dose was administered one hour preoperatively and the second dose when the pain became moderate or severe, following the dissipation of the local anesthesia. Pain intensity and pain relief were assessed using standard verbal descriptor scales at 30 minutes and hourly for four hours after the postoperative dose. Measures of total effect, peak effect and duration of their effect were derived from these descriptors. Acetaminophen was no better than placebo. For peak and total effects, propoxyphene alone and the propoxyphene-acetaminophen combination were substantially superior to both placebo and acetaminophen alone. Duration of analgesia was also significantly longer with both propoxyphene-containing treatments. No side effects were reported. The results suggest that pretreatment with a narcotic agonist markedly improves postoperative analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "Development of a contingent tolerance to amphetamine (AMPH) anorexia has been reported with chronic s.c. injections in rats (Ghosh and Parvathy, 1973, 1976). Using this model, the present study examined the role of potential receptor sensitivity changes in the beta adrenergic and/or dopamine (DA) receptors in the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) during chronic central and peripheral drug injections. Chronic injections of AMPH into the PFH, or l-dopa injected s.c., resulted in persistent anorexia in the daily first 2 hr of eating on all test days compared with the next 2 hr that showed a progressive increase in eating with subsequent injections, the net effect being an apparent tolerance to its 4 hr anorexic effect. The tolerance patterns obtained with these two treatments were essentially the same as that of s.c. AMPH, suggesting a role for PFH catecholamine synapses, particularly at the postsynaptic receptor level. Selective beta adrenoceptor-mediated anorexia, as obtained with chronic PFH-injected nor-adrenaline and isoprenaline, was dose-dependent and persistent on all days, suggesting that no change in the sensitivity of PFH beta adrenoceptors had occurred. This contrasted with the PFH-injected DA, which produced a rapid tolerance development due to a progressive loss of effect in the first 2 hr. Present findings suggest that although beta adrenergic and DA mechanisms act in concert in eliciting the acute anorexic effects of AMPH, DA, rather than beta adrenergic system, has a predominant influence in the development of tolerance to the anorexic effect of AMPH.\r"

  ".W": "Norepinephrine (0.35 microgram/kg/min) was infused continuously for 20 min into either the carotid, femoral or superior mesenteric arteries of anesthetized, vagotomized and splenectomized dogs. Blood flow in these arteries was monitored continuously. Blood samples were taken from the aorta, jugular or femoral vein and the superior mesenteric and hepatic veins at 5-min intervals during a 20-min preinfusion period, the 20-min infusion period and a 20-min postinfusion interval. Blood samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay with antibodies raised against Leu- and Met-enkephalin. Norepinephrine infused into the carotid or femoral arteries did not affect plasma levels of enkephalin-like material. By contrast, plasma concentrations of both Leu- and Met-enkephalin-like material were more than doubled during norepinephrine infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, P less than .001. This increase in enkephalin-like material occurred in arterial as well as venous blood. Neither infusion of vasopressin nor prostaglandin F2 alpha into the superior mesenteric artery elicited a rise in plasma levels of enkephalin-like material. In adrenalectomized dogs, when norepinephrine was infused into the superior mesenteric artery, there was again a statistically significant elevation in plasma concentrations of both Leu- and Met-enkephalin-like material.\r"

  ".W": "Segments of rat aortic arch were studied to determine the existence of sexual dimorphism. The influence of the endothelium in mediating gender differences in contractility (maximum tension, Tmax) and sensitivity (ED50) to prostaglandin F2 alpha was measured. This was done in both intact and denuded vascular ring preparations which were dissected from adult male and female rats. Group I comprised untreated male and female rats; Groups II and III were treated with testosterone (10 mg/kg i.m.) or 17 beta-estradiol (2.5 mg/kg i.m.), respectively, on days 1, 3 and 6 and sacrificed on day 7. Intact vascular ring preparations from untreated females were significantly less sensitive (P less than .01) and less contractile (P less than .025) than those from the males. After the intimal surface of the aortic arch rings was rubbed the rings from females exhibited a significant increase in Tmax. However, in vessels from males endothelial denudation had no effect on either Tmax or ED50. Testosterone treatment of female rats significantly increased Tmax (P less than .01) and decreased the ED50 (P less than .01) when compared to rings from untreated females. Testosterone treatment did not significantly affect either parameter in vessels from females which had been rubbed. Testosterone treatment also had no significant effect in either intact or rubbed vessels from males. Estrogen treatment significantly increased the Tmax (P less than .05) of intact vessels from females and had no effect on other vessel segments. Thus, the gender difference in Tmax may relate to an attenuating effect of the endothelium on contractility in the rings from females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A complete crossover design was executed with all dogs receiving all doses of both naltrexone and morphine. The data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (dogs and treatments). Treatment variance was partitioned into a regression and residual component. A mathematical model for relating the intensity of abstinence (PAS) to the concentrations of morphine and naltrexone was developed using the law of mass action and assuming that the degree of morphine physical dependence is related directly to the number of mu receptors occupied by morphine and the intensity of PAS is proportional to the number of receptors from which morphine is displaced by the antagonist. Using the mathematical model the deviations of the observed values from the calculated values were minimized using an iterative curve-fitting procedure which varied the values of the dissociation constants of morphine (KA) and naltrexone (KB) and the activity coefficient for morphine (alpha). The analysis of variance showed that the treatment effect was significant and that the regression accounted for most of this variance. The values which provided the best fit were: KA, 1.58 mg/kg; KB, 0.95 microgram/kg; and alpha, 245.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Noninvasive tumors nearly always were hypodiploid or diploid. All invasive tumors showed hyperploid cells. Cytogenetically, there was no difference between invasive grade 2 and grade 3 tumors. During our limited followup tumor progression was found only in tumors with hyperploid cells. With a direct technique we found no difference in the frequency of marker chromosomes according to tumor stage and grade.\r"

We describe here the first response of the human seminiferous tubule to prostaglandins. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-9) M to 10(-6) M) produced contractions of the seminiferous tubules in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, prostaglandins F1 alpha (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M), E1 (10(-9) M to 10(-6) M) and E2 (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M) produced relaxations of the seminiferous tubules which were dose dependent. The results from these experiments suggest that prostaglandins modulate the in vitro contractility of the human seminiferous tubules and thus may regulate the transport of spermatozoa and tubular fluid to the rete testis.\r"

Women whose menopause occurred at or after age 50 were at increased risk relative to those whose menopause occurred earlier. There was no association between number of years of education and breast cancer in black women.

After 48 hours, the 50% growth-inhibition doses (ID50) of ET-18-OCH3 were found to be 0.78 microgram/ml (HL60), 1.53 microgram/ml (Raji), 4.41 micrograms/ml (K562), and 5.05 micrograms/ml (L1210), as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. At the same time, cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and revealed median lethal doses (LD50) of 3.5 micrograms/ml (HL60), 15 micrograms/ml (Raji), 24 micrograms/ml (L1210), and 38 micrograms/ml (K562). Since O-alkyl cleavage enzyme previously was suggested as being important in the detoxification of cytotoxic ALPs, the enzyme activity was compared with the susceptibility to ET-18-OCH3 in the distinct cell lines. In comparison to an approximate sevenfold to elevenfold (ID50 and LD50, respectively) difference in the susceptibility of the above leukemia cell lines to ET-18-OCH3, no significant difference in the specific activities (0.13-0.21 nmol/min/mg) of the O-alkyl cleavage enzyme was found in the above leukemia cell lines. Therefore, the differential sensitivity of the above lines investigated cannot be explained by differences in O-alkyl cleavage enzyme activity. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-18-OCH3 in Raji cells suggest, rather, a critical role for phospholipases C and/or D in ALP metabolism.\r"

The risk pattern for each of the four anatomic sites was quite distinctive, suggesting at least four different etiologic complexes. For each site the observed gradients of risk are nearly identical for each sex, usually with risk for immigrants intermediary between that for homeland residents and that for local natives; the differences between race-ethnic groups are consistent with known international patterns. Particularly notable is the contrast between the low risks of cancer of both the sigmoid and the rectum in Japan and the high risks for Japanese immigrants to Los Angeles, which are nearly double those of their U.S. white neighbors. In all instances, and especially for both the upper and lower colon, the influence of the adult environment predominates over that of the early environment. The environmental determinants of stomach cancer do not always appear in inverse correlation with those of colon cancer, since Japanese immigrants to Los Angeles and their descendants are at high absolute and relative risk of both neoplasms. Our findings suggest that patterns of risk in relation to migration are complex and defy simple dietary or other interpretation. Without more information about the impact of migration to the United States on qualitative and quantitative aspects of lifestyle, it is not possible to put forward simple hypotheses that explain all available facts.\r"

Among current cigarette smokers of 1-20 cigarettes per day and over 20 per day, the odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, race, alcohol consumption, estrogen use, and oral contraceptive use for breast cancer were 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-1.09] and 0.57 (95% CI 0.30-1.08), respectively.

If the comparison was ever versus never drinkers, the adjusted OR was 1.47 (95% CI 1.10-1.97); for current drinkers versus nondrinkers, the adjusted OR was 1.89 (95% CI 1.40-2.56). The ORs were adjusted for age, race, cigarette smoking, estrogen use, an oral contraceptive use. These data supports those reports showing an inverse association of cigarette smoking and a positive association of alcohol consumption with breast cancer risk.\r"

There are no conclusive data on the drug as a human carcinogen, but one of its metabolites, hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2), has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and mice. To assess the relationship of hydralazine to human breast cancer, 3,419 women with breast cancer and 3,219 hospital control subjects were studied. Data were obtained by interview in hospitals in the United States and Canada. A total of 1.4% of the cases and 1.2% of the controls had used hydralazine. Compared with never use, the relative risk (RR) estimate for hydralazine that was first used at least 18 months before admission was 0.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-1.7] after risk factors for breast cancer and the use of other antihypertensive drugs and diuretics were taken into account by multivariate analysis. The RR estimate for hydralazine use lasting at least 1 year was 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.7). RR estimates for longer durations of use (up to 5 or more yr), and for use within strata of risk factors for breast cancer, were close to 1.0. The results suggest that hydralazine does not increase the risk of breast cancer in humans in the short term. Whether the risk is increased after latent intervals of many years could not be evaluated.\r"

Statistically significant (P less than .05) increases in the incidence of intracranial gliomas were observed among several professional and white-collar occupations, possibly due in part to higher levels of diagnosis and reporting of this particular neoplasm. Significantly elevated rates were noted among male dentists, agricultural research workers, and public prosecutors and among female physicians and employees in the health care industry. For blue-collar workers, significant excesses were found among welders and metal cutters; glass, porcelain, or ceramic workers; cellulose plant employees; brick and tile workers; and women employed in the wool industry. Several findings of this survey may represent new clues to the etiology of intracranial gliomas, while other findings support observations reported in previous studies.\r"

  ".W": "The inducibility of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] binding by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) was examined in tumor-derived clonal bone cell lines, in established clonal cell lines derived from normal embryonic bone, and in cultured bone cell populations freshly isolated from 18- and 21-day fetal and 5-day-old neonatal rat calvaria. Levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding were determined using a single saturating dose (84 pM) of 3H-labeled 1,25-(OH)2D3. Bone-derived tumor cell lines (ROS 17/2.8, ROS 17/2, RCJ 3.2T.1, RCJ 3.2.4.1CAM, RCJ 3.2CE2.1) possessed high basal levels of binding and showed increases in 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding after culture for 24 hours in the presence of 10(-5) M RA. The non-tumor-derived established bone cell lines (RCB 2.2A, RCB 2.2B, RCB 2.2C, RCB 2.2D) showed low basal 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding levels and no change in response to RA, while first subcultures of bone cell populations derived from fetal and neonatal rat calvaria showed decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding, following similar treatment with RA. In representative cell populations, the dose dependency of the RA effect was established. The observed differences in response to RA in the cell lines tested seem to be dependent on whether the cells originated from normal or tumor tissue.\r"

Unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitoleic (16:1), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), linolenic (18:3), and arachidonic (20:4) acids, were significantly more effective killers of tumor cells in vitro than the corresponding saturated fatty acids of the same carbon length, including palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), and arachidic (20:0) acids. The saturated 16-carbon fatty acid (palmitic acid) was more toxic to tumor cells in vitro than the saturated 18-carbon (stearic) and 20-carbon (arachidic) acids. Injections of linoleic (18:2)-linolenic (18:3) acid combinations into rats inoculated with the tumor significantly enhanced the survival of the tumor-bearing animals. These results suggest that natural FFAs may under certain conditions be utilized as effective anticancer agents.\r"

  ".W": "The phagocytic capacity of 4 continuous rat glioma cell lines (BT2C, BT4Cn, BT5c, and 9L) and normal BD IX fetal rat glial cells in culture has been studied. This was done by flow cytometric measurements of single cells from monolayer cultures having ingested fluorescent bacteria, zymosan particles, red blood cells, or fragments of normal glial cells. In addition, phagocytosis was studied in a three-dimensional culture system. The BT4Cn, BT5C, and 9L cell lines were tumorigenic and invasive both in vivo and in organ culture in vitro. In contrast, BT2C has shown variable tumorigenicity and does not seem to be invasive. The phagocytic capacity of the cell lines was compared to their destructive properties during invasion. Depending on the particle type, 30-40% of the normal glial cells were phagocytic. The fractions of phagocytic glioma cells were dependent on the particle type and the prey load. Of the invasive cell lines, BT5C showed high phagocytic activity both in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures. Two of the invasive cell lines (BT5C and 9L) had about the same fraction of phagocytic cells as normal glial cells. These 2 cell lines showed highly destructive growth during invasion. In contrast, the third invasive cell line (BT4Cn) had almost no phagocytic cells. The BT4Cn cells showed single-cell invasion with little destruction of target tissue. The noninvasive cell line (BT2C) showed low phagocytic activity, and almost no destruction was observed in the border zone between tumor cells and normal tissue. Phagocytosis seems to be an inherent property of both normal and malignant glial cells, although the fraction of phagocytic cells varies from one cell line to another. In organ culture high phagocytic capacity of invasive glioma cells seems to be related to destructive activity on the normal brain tissue during invasion.\r"

Whereas the 2 antioxidants BHA and TC inhibited the incidence of both liver and pancreatic lesions, CA, itself giving rise to considerable numbers of enzyme-altered foci, enhanced carcinogenesis in the liver while inhibiting carcinogenesis in the pancreas. All 3 of these agents induced hyperplastic and papillomatous lesions in the forestomachs of treated animals, independent of prior DOPN treatment; these forestomach lesions were not evident in controls. Cellular atypia and invasive growth characteristics signifying malignant change were also observed in BHA-induced forestomach lesions. The results demonstrate that hepatocarcinogenesis in the Syrian golden hamster, like that in the rat, can be inhibited by antioxidants. The similar decrease in putative preneoplastic lesion yield evident in the pancreas of BHA- or TC-treated hamsters, considered in the light of similarities in altered enzyme phenotype in carcinogen-induced lesions of both organs, suggests that common biochemical changes can be an underlying factor in the modification of neoplastic development in liver and pancreas. The present results also provide further evidence that CA has carcinogenic potential for the liver and forestomach of experimental animals.\r"

Groups of male animals were given 8 weekly injections of one of these carcinogens and then were maintained on a basal diet or a diet supplemented with 1% butylated hydroxyanisole [(BHA) CAS: 25013-16-5], or they were given the respective carcinogens in the drinking water until they were sacrificed at week 34. While DENA specifically induced tracheal polyps and hepatocellular foci and nodules, DMH administration was associated with development of both hepatocellular and hemangiocellular liver lesions as well as forestomach papillomas and adenocarcinomas of the large intestine. DBN induced lesions in the urinary bladder, forestomach, and trachea, in addition to a few preneoplastic foci in the liver and lungs. In all organs studied, preneoplastic and neoplastic populations were essentially similar to those observed in other experimental animals, with colon and tracheal lesions demonstrating alteration in polysaccharide metabolism. While inhibiting the development of hepatocellular lesions, especially in the group initiated with DENA, and while itself inducing extensive papillomatous forestomach hyperplasia, BHA administration did not exert a significant modifying influence on tumorigenesis in other organs. The present results demonstrate the efficacy of Syrian golden hamster studies for investigation of comparative neoplasia. Of particular interest in this respect were differences in the degree of phenotypic instability demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive foci induced by the 3 carcinogens, which indicated a possible qualitative variation in \"initiation.\"\r"

Spleen cells of C57BL/6 mice immunized with a highly tumorigenic, chemically induced murine cultured colon 36 tumor (C-C36) of BALB/c origin were hybridized with NS-1, a hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient myeloma line of BALB/c mice. Screening of hybridomas revealed an antibody that reacted with C-C36 and transformed Swiss 3T3 cells growing in soft agar after transfection of 3T3 cells with C-C36 DNA. The hybridomas that did not react with nontransformed 3T3 and the less tumorigenic BALB/c hemangioendothelioma line D10 were then selected. An MoAb was designated \"#71295.\" This MoAb immunoprecipitated the antigen that consisted of 65,000- and 14,000-molecular-weight components with soluble C-C36 membrane antigens. It also reacted with 2 other chemically induced syngeneic colon tumor lines, cultured colon 26 tumor line and cultured colon 51 tumor line, and with fibrosarcoma Meth A. However, #71295 was not found in NS-1, D14, and BALB/c normal thymus, liver, colon, and kidney tissues. In addition, this MoAb could not inhibit the anchorage-independent growth of C-C36 and transformed 3T3 cells. These results suggest that although the molecule defined by #71295 might not be associated with the anchorage independence of cell growth, it could be a newly expressed determinant on the cell surface that is related to the events of cell transformation.\r"

Genetic markers were detected by hybridizing DNA extracted from tumors with a 32P-labeled bacterial gene. Clones containing unique genetic markers were mixed and injected into the footpads of normal syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Footpad tumors were amputated when they were 1 cm in diameter. Individual pulmonary metastases were harvested and expanded by implantation in nude mice. Although footpad tumors contained both genetic markers, virtually all (13/15) pulmonary metastases contained single unique genetic markers. Pulmonary metastases of both marker types were identified. Two examples of pulmonary metastases of mixed origin were detected. The Southern hybridization technique was sufficiently sensitive to detect a clone that was present at 5% of the total cell population.\r"

  ".W": "Two isolates of Fusarium moniliforme from corn were used in a chronic study with groups of 30 inbred male BD IX rats fed a semipurified diet that was marginally adequate nutritionally. Group 1 served as the controls and received the semipurified diet containing 5% cornmeal, group 2 received 5% of strain MRC 1069 culture material that was nontoxic to rats, and group 3 received 0.5% of strain MRC 826 culture material that was highly toxic to rats. The amount of the mutagen fusarin C detected in the culture material of strains MRC 826 and MRC 1069 was 104 and 364 mg/kg, respectively. Survival up to 2 years was good in all groups. Pathologic examination showed that many rats in group 2 had mild ductular cell hyperplasia. Almost all rats in group 3 had neoplastic nodules, gamma-glutamyltransferase-positive foci, adenofibrosis, and esophageal basal cell hyperplasia. Whereas no tumors were induced in groups 1 and 2, the 21 long-term survivors in group 3 developed 8 cholangiocarcinomas, 2 hepatocellular carcinomas, 4 carcinomas of the forestomach epithelium, and 1 esophageal papilloma. Since neoplastic lesions were confined to rats in group 3 and the diet of these rats contained much less fusarin C than that of group 2, it is highly unlikely that fusarin C was responsible for the carcinogenicity of the MRC 826 culture material. It appears that the toxicity of F. moniliforme strains may be related to their carcinogenicity, but the chemical nature of the toxic and carcinogenic metabolite(s) produced by F. moniliforme MRC 826 remains unknown.\r"

Rearrangement of int region DNAs associated with proviral amplification occurred more frequently in spontaneous tumors (19 of 27) than in tumors from HPOs (7 of 37) and rarely occurred in HPOs (1 of 29).

When athymic mice (NCR-nu) were inoculated with 10(6) cells, tumors appeared after 7-14 days with a 93-100% take rate and grew with an initial volume-doubling time of around 6 days. For optimizing the tumor disaggregation method, a comparison was made of two dissociation procedures and of different dissociation times. An enzyme cocktail (collagenase, DNase, pronase) resulted in total viable cell yields of 1-3 X 10(7) cells/g tumor tissue. Cell yield decreased with increasing tumor weight. Disaggregation with trypsin gave lower cell yields; and so, although the plating efficiencies (PEs) were higher, the enzyme cocktail was chosen for tumor disaggregation. On the basis of morphologic identification, cell suspensions prepared from WiDr tumors, by use of the enzyme cocktail for 2 hours, contained 49% malignant cells as well as a significant fraction of nonneoplastic cells. The major nonneoplastic host cell component was macrophage (33%); lymphocytes (13%) and granulocytes (5%) also were present. Host cells could be separated from neoplastic cells by centrifugal elutriation. By mixing various proportions of host and tumor cells, it was subsequently shown that the presence of host cells did not influence the malignant cell PE unless the cell suspensions contained greater than 90% host cells. Single-cell suspensions prepared from WiDr tumors, with use of the enzyme cocktail for 2 hours, were irradiated and then plated for survival (D0 = 1.5 Gy; n = 5) (D0, the 37% dose slope). A comparison was made of the sensitivity to radiation, after the different dissociation methods. The radiation sensitivities after 1.5-hour trypsinization and 2- and 6-hour enzyme cocktail administrations were similar, but after 0.5 hour of trypsin, the cells were more sensitive to radiation.\r"

HRCC lines were established in vitro from a surgical specimen (SN12C) or from a liver metastasis produced in BALB/c nude mice by cells from the original specimen implanted into their kidney (SN12L1). Cultured HRCC cells of both lines were injected into the subcutis and the renal subcapsule (RSC) of nude mice. Tumor growth and metastatic behavior were monitored. In both cell lines, tumor cells injected into the RSC displayed faster growth and produced more systemic metastases than did cells injected sc. The kidney tumors were large, invasive, highly vascularized, nonencapsulated, and with minimal central necrosis. In contrast, the subcutaneous tumors were highly encapsulated, with peripheral vascularization and extensive necrosis that developed as early as 2 weeks after sc implantation. The SN12L1 cells were also implanted into nude mice by iv, ip, and intrasplenic injections. The most dramatic production of metastasis occurred after the tumor cells were injected into the kidney. These results indicate that the biologic behavior of this HRCC is influenced by the implantation site in nude mice. At least for the HRCC tested, the kidney is the natural organ for growth. Implantation into the RSC is advantageous for the study of the biology and therapy of HRCC in nude mice.\r"

Because the cyclic nitrosocarbamate 3-nitroso-2-oxazolidinone (NOZ) is readily produced during the synthesis of HENU and can be confused with HENU, HENU was retested and NOZ was tested for carcinogenicity. Improved syntheses of both compounds are described. They were administered in drinking water to male MRC-Wistar rats for 1 year, starting at 3 or 9 weeks of age. The HENU-treated rats showed incidences of 48% for bone tumors, 32% for intestinal tumors (mostly duodenal adenocarcinomas), and 53% for lymphoma-leukemia. Of the bone tumors, which were evaluated microscopically and radiologically, 68% were osteosarcomas and 32% were osteoblastomas. The skeletal distribution of these tumors was similar to that of human osteosarcoma, with the tumors occurring most frequently in the lower limbs near the knees. Of the hematopoietic tumors, the majority were lymphoblastic lymphoma-leukemia, which showed a diffuse organ distribution resembling human B-cell (Burkitt's-like) lymphoblastic lymphoma-leukemia, and differed from the usual type of convoluted T-cell lymphoma-leukemia induced by other nitrosoureas in rats and mice. NOZ induced intestinal tumors (mostly duodenal adenocarcinomas) in 80% and liver tumors (mostly hepatocellular adenomas) in 53% of the rats.\r"

The children's growth slowed and they crossed height percentiles towards the end of or after treatment. The Z-score, which reflects the deviation of height measurements from the population mean, was used to assess height change. The mean Z-score was 0.16 at diagnosis, -0.30 2 years later, -0.71 4 years later, and -1.37 6 years later. Height for age had fallen by more than 1 standard deviation of the population mean in 32% of survivors 4 years after diagnosis and in 71% 6 years after diagnosis. Younger children and those tall for age at diagnosis were more severely affected. Growth-hormone (GH) response to standard provocation tests was measured in 46 patients; 30 had partial or complete GH deficiency. Mean pulsatile GH secretion was low in the 34 patients tested. Cranial irradiation is probably the most important causative factor in the development of GH deficiency in survivors of ALL.\r"

Of men who did not engage in receptive anal intercourse within six months before baseline and in the six-month follow-up period, only 0.5% (3/646) seroconverted to HIV. By contrast, of men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse with two or more partners during each of these successive six-month intervals, 10.6% (58/548) seroconverted. No HIV seroconversions occurred in 220 homosexual men who did not practise receptive or insertive anal intercourse within twelve months before the follow-up visit. On multivariate analysis receptive anal intercourse was the only significant risk factor for seroconversion to HIV, the risk ratio increasing from 3-fold for one partner to 18-fold for five or more partners. Furthermore, data for the two successive six-month periods show that men who reduced or stopped the practice of receptive anal intercourse significantly lowered their risk of seroconversion to 3.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Receptive anal intercourse accounted for nearly all new HIV infections among the homosexual men enrolled in this study, and the hazards of this practice need to be emphasised in community educational projects.\r"

The incidence of HIV-associated AIDS in the Ivory Coast is likely to rise sharply in the next few years.\r"

We report here that the valosin-specific complementary DNA clone from pigs codes for a polypeptide unlike most precursors of biologically active peptides. The predicted protein lacks a characteristic amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and contains no processing signals of the type acted upon by endopeptidases to generate other active peptides from precursors. Antibodies to synthetic valosin have been used to show that nearly all valosin immunoreactivity is in the cytoplasm and that the protein detected (valosin-containing protein, VCP), although smaller than the predicted product of the cDNA sequence, is much larger than valosin. Valosin-specific messenger RNA is found in extracts from many pig tissues, which contrasts with the restricted occurrence expected of a biologically active peptide. We conclude that valosin is an artefact of the purification procedure and does not occur in vivo.\r"

Distinct CA 125 assay trends have emerged from prospective serial monitoring. Among patients who were clinically and surgically free of disease after the completion of cytoreductive chemotherapy, the CA 125 assay always fell to levels under 35 U/mL within the first three months of cytoreductive chemotherapy, and stayed at low levels. Patients with partial cytoreduction operations had decreases in serum CA 125 levels only if there was a response to further therapy. The rate of fall of the CA 125 levels correlated with clinical outcome. All 13 patients with serum CA 125 above 35 U/mL after three months of treatment invariably had persistent tumors after subsequent chemotherapy, whereas in patients showing reduction of the CA 125 to levels below 35 U/mL, there were no surgically detectable tumors. Measurement of CA 125 during treatment might permit an early change to alternative and optimal forms of therapeutic management. The CA 125 level three months after treatment appears to be a critical predictor of response to therapy.\r"

Therefore, corneal studies were performed on infant monkeys wearing EWCL for the correction of surgical aphakia. Nine newborn monkeys underwent unilateral lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy. Seven eyes were fitted with aphakic EWCL postoperatively and two wore no lenses. After at least six months, corneas were studied with slit-lamp and specular microscopy, and with light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Small central corneal opacities developed in two aphakic eyes corrected with EWCL after episodes of keratoconjunctivitis. One of these corneas was found to have a mildly increased coefficient of variation (CV) of endothelial cell size (polymegathism). Although EWCL are well tolerated by the corneas of aphakic infant primates, their association with endothelial polymegathism, which may indicate physiologic compromise, mandates careful long-term follow-up.\r"

It could be demonstrated, with the use of metal markers attached to a dry human skull, that the radiopacities seen in the region of the hard palate represent the junction of the nasal septum and the hard palate and the junction of the maxillary sinus to the hard palate. The appearance of one or two lines depends on the angulation of the skull. A more inclined (chin-down) position of the skull produces two lines, whereas a chin-up position results in a superimposition of the two lines and produces only one line. The image of the junction of the bony septum and palate is unsharp because of the greater distance from the focal plane. The junction of the maxillary sinus to the hard palate is closer to the image layer and will appear as a sharp line.\r"

Its presence is ubiquitous in the middle class. \"Crack\" users can become dangerous to themselves and to others, even to the extent of committing murder. Cardiac irritability and hypertension are among the associated severe problems of \"crack\" abuse. The toxicity of cocaine is therefore a major problem. It is imperative that all practitioners become aware of the signs and symptoms of cocaine toxicity and its management. This awareness can help to avoid or alleviate a crisis in the clinic or office.\r"

Excellent posterior joint exposure, good lateral joint exposure, and fair anterior joint exposure are obtained. The risk of injury to the facial nerve is decreased. An extended modification of the postauricular incision was developed to overcome some of the disadvantages of the postauricular incision while maintaining its advantages. The incision begins inferiorly in a curvilinear manner, over the mastoid tip and progresses superiorly 3 mm posterior to the postauricular flexure. As it ascends superiorly above the level of the external auditory canal, it progresses posteriorly from the flexure. It then progresses superiorly in a curvilinear fashion in the temporal area slightly superior to the customary superior aspect of the preauricular incision. The dissection is carried to and through the temporalis fascia and periosteum, over the root of the zygomatic arch, and anteriorly after crosscut of the external auditory canal to the parotideomasseteric fascia. Dissection anteriorly deep to these fused structures allows a single flap to the skin. With this anterior dissection, the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve are protected and contained within the skin-fascia flap. The capsule is thus exposed and further dissection into the joint is described. A representative case presentation demonstrates the extended modified postauricular incision.\r"

The optimization of a reverse-phase isolation scheme has led to the purification of sufficient material to allow for the identification of six different related compounds. The structures of two of these compounds have been assigned as a set of epimeric dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol beta-D-glycosides.

As a step toward this goal, small (13- or 15-mer) synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides have been coupled at their 3' ends to epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues of poly(L-lysine) (Mr, 14,000). A 15-mer oligonucleotide-poly(L-lysine) conjugate complementary to the initiation region of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) N-protein mRNA specifically inhibits the synthesis of VSV proteins and exerts an antiviral activity against VSV when added in the cell culture medium at doses as low as 100 nM. Neither synthesis of cellular proteins nor multiplication of encephalomyocarditis virus was affected significantly by this oligonucleotide conjugate. The data suggest that oligonucleotide-poly(L-lysine) conjugates might become effective for studies on gene expression regulation and for antiviral chemotherapy.\r"

The results are equivalent to those provided by the steady-state formalism. While the latter applies uniformly to all schemes, the formalism presented here requires adaptation to each additional class of schemes. However, it has the merit of allowing one to leave unspecified many details of the scheme, including topological ones. Furthermore, it allows one to decompose a scheme into subschemes, analyze the parts separately, and use the intermediate results to derive the rate equation of the complete scheme. The method is applied here to derive general equations for one- and two-entry site enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamate decarboxylase (GDCase; L-glutamate-1-carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.15) was purified from whole rat brain approximately equal to 1300-fold to apparent homogeneity with a specific activity of 2.4 units per mg of protein by a combination of column chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and gel filtration, and preparative nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified preparation contained a single protein band that comigrated with GDCase activity in three diverse analyses: nondenaturing regular (5%) and gradient (3.6-25%) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing at pH 4-7. The native molecular mass was calculated to be 120 +/- 10 kDa from gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 110 +/- 10 kDa from gel filtration. Under the treatment with NaDodSO4 and 2-mercaptoethanol, GDCase dissociated into two subunits of 40 +/- 2 and 80 +/- 4 kDa, as estimated from NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis. However, only a 40-kDa subunit was detected when GDCase was treated with 4 M urea plus NaDodSO4 and 2-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the 80-kDa subunit is the dimer of the 40-kDa subunit. In immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies against GDCase reacted with both 40- and 80-kDa subunits, while monoclonal antibody reacted with only 80-kDa subunits. The isoelectric point of the native enzyme was 5.4. The Km for glutamate was 1.59 X 10(-3) M. In addition to L-glutamate, cysteine sulfinic acid was also decarboxylated at approximately equal to 10% of the rate of glutamate. The pH optimum was fairly broad, with a maximum at approximately equal to 7.3. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by carbonyl-trapping agents, sulfhydryl reagents, thiol compounds, and beta-methylene-DL-aspartate.\r"

  ".U": "87118232\r", 
  ".W": "The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein GRP78 is a stress-inducible protein ubiquitously expressed in animal cells. In this paper we show that the first exon of this endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein consists of an 18 amino acid leader sequence rich in hydrophobic residues, followed by a highly acidic mature N-terminus and an 11 amino acid domain that is shared by members of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family. The end of this shared domain also marks the beginning of the first intron of this gene. A DNA region upstream of the promoter element important for induction by calcium ionophore and by a temperature-sensitive mutation was identified by deletion analysis. Our results indicate that a region spanning from 85 to 480 nucleotides upstream of the major transcription initiation site is important for both induction conditions. With evidence suggesting that perturbations in protein glycosylation may be one of the common stimuli involved in transcription activation of the GRPs, we measured the rate of glycosylation during A23187, glucose starvation, and temperature-shift induced conditions. The inverse correlation observed between the rate of glycosylation and the steady-state level of the GRP78 transcripts lends support to this hypothesis.\r"

We also sequenced a partial cDNA clone from human fibroblasts that contained a 153-base-pair deletion within the coding sequence and found a second type of cDNA clone from placenta that contained the same deletion. Nuclease S1 mapping studies demonstrated two types of mRNAs in human placenta that corresponded to the two types of cDNA clones isolated. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determined for human spleen beta-glucuronidase agreed with that inferred from the DNA sequence of the two placental clones, beginning at amino acid 23, suggesting a cleaved signal sequence of 22 amino acids. When transfected into COS cells, plasmids containing either placental clone expressed an immunoprecipitable protein that contained N-linked oligosaccharides as evidenced by sensitivity to endoglycosidase F. However, only transfection with the clone containing the 153-base-pair segment led to expression of human beta-glucuronidase activity. These studies provide the sequence for the full-length cDNA for human beta-glucuronidase, demonstrate the existence of two populations of mRNA for beta-glucuronidase in human placenta, only one of which specifies a catalytically active enzyme, and illustrate the importance of expression studies in verifying that a cDNA is functionally full-length.\r"

  ".U": "87118238\r", 
  ".W": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) expression was studied in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells that differentiate in response to retinoic acid into cells resembling either parietal endoderm or visceral endoderm of the parietal or visceral yolk sac. F9 cells secreted newly synthesized apoE when incubated with radiolabeled amino acid. Upon differentiation to parietal endoderm-like cells, apoE synthesis and secretion were markedly down-regulated. In contrast, apoE secretion was up-regulated upon differentiation to visceral endoderm-like cells. These changes in apoE expression were due, at least in part, to regulation of apoE mRNA abundance since visceral endoderm-like cells contained 5- to 7-fold more apoE mRNA than parietal endoderm-like cells. The apoE phenotype reflected the differentiated state of the F9 cell since either the up-regulated or down-regulated pattern was stable to the removal of the retinoic acid inducer. To determine how well apoE regulation in F9 cells reflects regulation in visceral and parietal yolk sacs, apoE mRNA was measured in yolk sac tissues of the 12-day mouse embryo. Visceral yolk sac contained 109 +/- 11 pg of apoE mRNA per micrograms of RNA while parietal yolk sac contained 14.3 +/- 3.1 pg/micrograms of RNA. This 7- to 8-fold difference is similar to the difference in the apoE mRNA contents of visceral endoderm-like and parietal endoderm-like F9 cells. RNA gel blot analysis showed that apoE mRNA is the same size in F9 cells as in yolk sac tissues and fetal or adult liver. In addition, primer-extension analysis showed that transcription is initiated at or near the same site on the apoE gene in F9 cells and mouse tissues. These data suggest that both quantitative and qualitative features of apoE gene expression in development are retained in the F9 cell. The F9 cell should provide a useful system to study the developmental activation of endogenous apolipoprotein genes as well as exogenous apolipoprotein genes introduced by transfection.\r"

When applied to a linear four-state cyclic enzyme system, the formalism can be used to prove analytically the finding that an enzyme can extract the free energy from an externally applied fluctuating membrane potential and perform active free energy transduction.

The sequence of OEE2 cDNA, the deduced amino acid sequence of the preprotein, the N-terminal protein sequence of mature OEE2 protein, and the coding regions of the single OEE2 gene are presented. The protein is synthesized with a 57-amino acid N-terminal transit peptide that directs the transport of this polypeptide across three cellular membranes. A nuclear mutant of C. reinhardtii, deficient in oxygen-evolving activity, is shown to be specifically missing OEE2 polypeptides. This mutation, which results in the complete absence of all OEE2 mRNA and protein, does not affect the accumulation of other photosystem II polypeptides or their mRNAs.\r"

Chem. 257, 8386-8390] neutralized DNA polymerase alpha activity from rat embryonic fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive transformation mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (tsLA24). After centrifugation of a crude cytosol fraction from log-phase cells in a 5-20% linear sucrose gradient, polypeptides of Mr approximately equal to 185,000 and 220,000 were immunoprecipitated only from gradient fractions containing DNA polymerase alpha activity. When similar cultures were incubated in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate, it was found that the Mr 220,000 protein was phosphorylated but that the other peptides specific for polymerase alpha activity did not contain detectable amounts of phosphate. Phospho amino acid analysis of the high molecular weight immunoprecipitable proteins indicated that the labeled amino acid was phosphoserine. Incubation of 2.5 units of crude DNA polymerase alpha with 4 units of agarose-immobilized alkaline phosphatase resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha activity. Subsequent incubation of this preparation with 5 or 50 microM ATP, but not the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, restored the in vitro DNA polymerizing activity. These results demonstrate that a high molecular weight DNA polymerase alpha (Mr approximately equal to 220,000) is phosphorylated in cultured cells and that this protein is a substrate for a serine kinase rather than the tyrosine-specific protein kinase of Rous sarcoma virus. The results suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions modulate the activity of this polymerase.\r"

  ".W": "The Mov-13 mouse strain carries a retroviral insertion in the pro alpha 1(I) collagen gene that prevents transcription of the gene. Cell lines derived from homozygous embryos do not express type I collagen although normal amounts of pro alpha 2 mRNA are synthesized. We have introduced genomic clones of either the human or mouse pro alpha 1(I) collagen gene into homozygous cell lines to assess whether the human or mouse pro alpha 1(I) chains can associate with the endogenous mouse pro alpha 2(I) chain to form stable type I collagen. The human gene under control of the simian virus 40 promoter was efficiently transcribed in the transfected cells. Protein analyses revealed that stable heterotrimers consisting of two human alpha 1 chains and one mouse alpha 2 chain were formed and that type I collagen was secreted by the transfected cells at normal rates. However, the electrophoretic migration of both alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains in the human-mouse hybrid molecules were retarded, compared to the alpha (I) chains in control mouse cells. Inhibition of the posttranslational hydroxylation of lysine and proline resulted in comigration of human and mouse alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains, suggesting that increased posttranslational modification caused the altered electrophoretic migration in the human-mouse hybrid molecules. Amino acid sequence differences between the mouse and human alpha chains may interfere with the normal rate of helix formation and increase the degree of posttranslational modifications similar to those observed in patients with lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta. The Mov-13 mouse system should allow us to study the effect specific mutations introduced in transfected pro alpha 1(I) genes have on the synthesis, assembly, and function of collagen I.\r"

A panel of murine monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity towards rabbit proteoglycan were utilized to characterize the epitope specificity of the immune synovitis polyclonal anti-proteoglycan response. One murine monoclonal antibody, 6C11, inhibited the binding of the polyclonal antisera to proteoglycan in all nine animals with significant (greater than 40%) inhibition in six of nine rabbits. Further inhibition studies utilizing DEAE-cellulose-resolved proteoglycan tryptic peptides revealed that peptides poor in chondroitin sulfate were strong inhibitors of binding of the polyclonal antibodies to the proteoglycan substrate. In particular, keratan sulfate-containing tryptic peptides were most inhibitory on a per weight basis. These results indicate that, in chronic IgG-induced immune synovitis, anti-proteoglycan antibodies elicited are heterogeneous with regard to specificity, but a relatively large proportion predominantly recognized a portion of the proteoglycan molecule containing core protein and associated keratan sulfate.\r"

The MCF-7ras cell line was tumorigenic in the absence of estrogens and secreted 3- to 5-fold elevated levels of a high molecular weight form of a type alpha transforming growth factor-like growth factor, type beta transforming growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor I. MCF-7ras cells, in contrast to MCF-7, were less sensitive to further growth stimulation by estrogen, type alpha transforming growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor I and showed little change in receptor levels for these hormones. Conditioned medium from MCF-7ras cells as well as two of its component growth factors (insulin-like growth factor I and type alpha transforming growth factor) replaced estrogen in stimulating MCF-7 colony formation in vitro.

Infected liver tissue from patients with low levels of viral replication was analyzed for HBV DNA copy number per haploid cell genome. Total cellular DNA, with sufficient HBV DNA, was digested with the restriction endonucleases Msp I and Hpa II, to determine whether the HBV DNA was methylated, or HindIII, to determine whether the HBV DNA was integrated or episomal. The cleavage fragments were analyzed by Southern blotting and hybridization to 32P-labeled HBV DNA. In replicative chronic hepatitis B, hypomethylation of the HBV genome correlated with HBV expression in both virions and infected tissue. In carriers with nonreplicative infection, it was difficult to ascertain the role of methylation as copy number was low. HBV DNA copy number was also low in 17 out of 29 of the tumor tissues tested and as many as 14 out of 16 of the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues tested. Integrated sequences were hypermethylated in the PLC/PRF/5 cell line and in six of the tumor tissues suggesting that methylation plays a role in HBV gene repression. However, since DNA from five other tumors was hypomethylated, the belief that methylation per se is an absolute determinant of HBV core gene repression does not hold for human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. Additional factors, such as gene rearrangements, therefore, must influence HBV expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in lymphocytes have indicated similarities in the state of activation, the time kinetics, and the pathologic states associated with the expression of the c-myc oncogene, and the expression of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptor protein. Here, we have sought evidence for an association between c-myc and the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein in mammalian cells other than lymphocytes. Comparing two rat osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, one that produces constitutively relatively high levels of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein (ROS 17/2.8) and one in which the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein is practically undetectable (ROS 2/3), we found that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-expressing cell line also expressed c-myc mRNA. In contrast, the cell line in which the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor was undetectable did not express c-myc mRNA. Furthermore, we transfected mouse skin fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) with a recombinant plasmid carrying the human c-myc oncogene. We found a dramatic increase in the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor concentration in five separate clonal lines of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the c-myc-carrying plasmid compared to their nontransfected counterparts or to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the vector plasmid alone. The receptor protein of the transfected cells exhibited biochemical characteristics indistinguishable from those of classical receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The increased expression in the transfected cells appeared specific for the receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3; receptors for sex steroids were not detected in the nontransfected NIH 3T3 cells and remained undetectable after transfection with c-myc. Moreover, the level of the glucocorticoid receptor protein, which was expressed in the nontransfected cells, did not change upon transfection with c-myc.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether or not proteins circulating in plasma can be incorporated into megakaryocytes and platelets, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected intravenously into guinea pigs and these cells were examined for its uptake by electron microscopy and cytochemistry. Enriched samples of megakaryocytes enabled ultrastructural analysis of large numbers of these rare cells. In megakaryocytes, 50% of alpha granules contained HRP between 75 min and 7 hr after injection. At 24 hr, 25% of the megakaryocyte granules were peroxidase-positive, less were positive by 48 hr, and there were none at 4 days. Thus, the findings demonstrate that a circulating protein can be endocytosed by megakaryocytes and rapidly packaged into alpha granules. Platelet granules also contain HRP by 7 hr after injection, and they can secrete it in response to thrombin. Unfortunately, our present studies do not allow us to distinguish between direct endocytosis by the platelet and/or shedding of new platelets from recently labeled megakaryocytes. It is concluded that while some alpha granule proteins are synthesized by megakaryocytes, others may be acquired from plasma by endocytosis. In addition to providing evidence that some of the proteins of alpha granules may be of exogenous origin, this study has allowed the definition of a pathway whereby plasma proteins may be temporarily sequestered in megakaryocytes before reentering the circulation in platelets.\r"

  ".W": "During investigations of the evolution of experimental laboratory infections of woodchucks (Marmota monax) with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), eight hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were observed, six in newborns and two in young adult animals, all within 17-36 months after infection. The absence of an external cocarcinogenic effect in the well-monitored woodchucks indicates the carcinogenicity of WHV and suggests the same for the genetically and biologically similar human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Laboratory infections of woodchucks with two strains of WHV, not reported here in detail, resembled human and chimpanzee HBV infections histologically and serologically. In these studies, eight woodchucks became carriers of surface antigen of WHV for greater than 1 year. All eight woodchucks developed HCC, indicating a 100% risk of HCC in experimentally infected chronic WHV antigen carriers, which is analogous to the high risk of HCC in human hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. Histologically, the absence of cirrhosis in the examined pericarcinomatous tissue permits recognition of gradual transition from normal parenchyma to neoplastic nodules to HCC of rising anaplasia, indicating a continuum of increasingly more malignant neoplastic stages, as known for chemical carcinogenesis. The HCC developed in carrier woodchucks infected as newborns with only minor, if any, hepatitic changes but is associated with antigen-carrying hepatocytes and sometimes with hyperplastic nodules. This stage was preceded in infected adults by an early, acute, weeks-long hepatitis coinciding with the appearance of surface antigen. These findings are also analogous to typical HBV infection in human newborns and young adults, respectively. At the time of HCC development in all animals with adequate histologic material, an acute recent necroinflammation appeared around the tumor, associated with abnormal hematopoietic cells around and within the tumor. A promoting role in carcinogenesis of this necroinflammation of yet unestablished pathogenesis is being postulated, to be confirmed by determination of the status of the WHV DNA in the HCC and by prospective histologic study of the inflammatory reaction.\r"

  ".W": "2-(4-Phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol (AH5183) is a noncompetitive and potent inhibitor of high-affinity acetylcholine transport into cholinergic vesicles. It is reported here that [3H]AH5183 binds specifically and saturably to slide-mounted sections of the rat forebrain (Kd = 1.1 to 2.2 X 10(-8) M; Bmax = 286 to 399 fmol/mg of protein). The association and dissociation rate constants for [3H]AH5183 binding are 8.6 X 10(6) M-1 X min-1 and 0.18 min-1, respectively. Bound [3H]AH5183 can be displaced by nonradioactive AH5183 and by the structural analog (2 alpha,3 beta,4A beta,8A alpha)-decahydro-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperidinyl)-2- naphthalenol but not by 10 microM concentrations of the cholinergic drugs acetylcholine, choline, atropine, hexamethonium, eserine, or hemicholinium-3 or by the structurally related compounds 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine, (+/-)-N-allylnormetazocine (SKF 10,047), levoxadrol, or dexoxadrol. Quantitative autoradiography reveals that [3H]AH5183 binding sites are distributed heterogenously throughout the rat forebrain and are highly localized to cholinergic nerve terminal regions. At the level of the caudate nucleus-putamen, the highest concentrations of saturable [3H]AH5183 binding (713-751 fmol/mg of protein) are found in the vertical limb of the diagonal band and the olfactory tubercle, with lesser amounts (334-516 fmol/mg of protein) in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, and the primary olfactory cortex. At day 7 after transsection of the left fimbria, [3H]AH5183 binding and choline acetyltransferase activity in the left hippocampus were reduced by 33 +/- 6% and 61 +/- 7%, respectively. These findings indicate that [3H]AH5183 binds to a unique recognition site in rat brain that is topographically associated with cholinergic nerve terminals.\r"

  ".W": "The primary sequences of four molecular mass variants (14, 17, 18.5, and 21.5 kDa) of the mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) have recently been determined through analysis of cDNA clones of their mRNAs. The mRNAs coding for the four MBP variants are thought to arise by differential splicing of two exons (exons 2 and 6) from a single gene. In contrast, exons 2 and 5 may be spliced out in the posttranscriptional processing of the human MBP gene. To investigate the possibility that a third exon (exon 5) may also be differentially spliced out in the processing of the mouse MBP gene transcript, a mouse cDNA library was screened to search for cDNAs missing exon 5. A MBP cDNA was isolated whose coding region specified a fifth mouse MBP variant with a molecular mass of approximately equal to 17 kDa. The mass of this variant (17,257 Da) is so close to that of the other 17-kDa mouse MBP (17,224 Da) that the two would be indistinguishable on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of the sequence of the cDNA clone indicates that excision of exons 2 and 5 of the mouse MBP gene would produce the mRNA encoding this newly described 17-kDa MBP, whereas excision of exon 6 would produce the mRNA for the other 17-kDa MBP variant. Thus, the \"17-kDa\" mouse MBP consists of at least two molecular forms with very similar molecular masses but markedly different primary sequences. Of five full-length or near full-length cDNAs representing 17-kDa MBPs, one was missing exons 2 and 5 and four were missing exon 6.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of benzodiazepine receptors have been demonstrated in mammalian tissues, one which is localized on neuronal elements in brain and the other, on glial cells and in peripheral tissues such as kidney. In vivo administration of 3H-labeled PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide] or [3H]flunitrazepam with 5 mg of clonazepam per kg to rats with intracranial C6 gliomas resulted in high levels of tritiated-drug binding to the tumor as shown by quantitative autoradiography. Pharmacological studies indicated that the bound drugs labeled the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. Binding to the peripheral benzodiazepine site was confirmed primarily to malignant cells with little binding to adjacent normal brain tissue or to necrotic tissue. Tumor cell binding was completely inhibited by preadministration of the peripheral benzodiazepine blocking agent PK 11195 at 5 mg/kg. The centrally selective benzodiazepine ligand clonazepam had no effect on PK 11195 binding to the tumor cells. When binding to other tumor cell lines grown in nude mice and nude athymic rats was evaluated, little or no peripheral benzodiazepine binding was detected on human pheochromocytoma (RN1) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH) tumor cells, respectively. However, high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were observed on tumors derived from a human glioma cell line (ATCC HTB 14, U-87 MG). The presence of high concentrations of specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on glial tumors suggests that human primary central nervous system tumors could be imaged and diagnosed using peripheral benzodiazepine ligands labeled with positron- or gamma-emitting isotopes.\r"

Voltage-clamp experiments show that DPI 201-106 acts on neuroblastoma cells and rat cardiac cells. S-DPI (205-430) increases the peak Na+ current, slows down the kinetics of Na+ channel inactivation, and is cardiotonic on heart cells. Conversely, R-DPI (205-429) reduces the peak Na+ current and blocks Na+ channel activity and cardiac contractions. Binding experiments using radioactively labeled toxins indicate that DPI 201-106 and its enantiomers do not interact with sites already identified for tetrodotoxin or sea anemone and scorpion toxins. DPI 201-106 and its enantiomers inhibit binding of a 3H-labeled batrachotoxin derivative, [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate, to brain membranes. The dissociation constant of the complex formed between the Na+ channel and both R-DPI and S-DPI is Kd congruent to 100 nM. 22Na+ uptake experiments using different cell types have shown that R and S enantiomers of DPI 201-106 are active on the different Na+ channel subtypes with similar IC50 values. These results are discussed in relation with the cardiotonic properties of DPI 201-106 that are not accompanied by cardiotoxic effects.\r"

The conditions other than the drug administered for prophylaxis were equivalent in the two studies. The incidence of fatal fungal infections was significantly higher among patients given ketoconazole than among those given itraconazole (P = .02); this trend was especially evident with fatal infections due to Aspergillus (P = .0045). The level of protection from fatal fungal infection afforded by itraconazole was highly significant among patients who were granulocytopenic for more than 25 days (P less than .0001) and among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = .008). Failures of prophylaxis with itraconazole may have been due to inadequate levels of drug in plasma. Although these results must be interpreted with caution because they were obtained in consecutive nonrandomized studies, the use of itraconazole for antifungal prophylaxis in granulocytopenic patients seems to be a major advance and to be especially advantageous in hospitals, where the incidence of fatal aspergillosis in these patients is high.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing quantities of man-made organic chemicals are released each year into the biosphere. Some of these compounds are both toxic and relatively resistant to physical, chemical, or biological degradation, and they thus constitute an environmental burden of considerable magnitude. Genetic manipulation of microbial catabolic pathways offers a powerful means by which to accelerate evolution of biodegradative routes through which such compounds might be eliminated from the environment. In the experiments described here, a catabolic pathway for alkylbenzoates specified by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas was restructured to produce a pathway capable of processing a new substrate, 4-ethylbenzoate. Analysis of critical steps in the TOL pathway that prevent metabolism of 4-ethylbenzoate revealed that this compound fails to induce synthesis of the catabolic enzymes and that one of its metabolic intermediates inactivates catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), the enzyme that cleaves the aromatic ring. Consequently, the pathway was sequentially modified by recruitment of genes from mutant bacteria selected for their production of either an altered pathway operon regulator that is activated by 4-ethylbenzoate or an altered C23O that is less sensitive to metabolite inactivation. The redesigned pathway was stably expressed and enabled host bacteria to degrade 4-ethylbenzoate in addition to the normal substrates of the TOL pathway.\r"

The properties of the x proteins were analyzed by constructing mutant genes containing site-directed deletions and point mutations. The results demonstrate that the amino terminal 17 amino acids of the x protein constitute part of a functional domain that is critical for the transcriptional activating properties of the protein. Within this region, substitution of a leucine residue for a proline residue results in major changes in the trans-activation phenotype of the protein. The mutant HTLV-II x protein, though incapable of activating the HTLV-II long terminal repeat, will block trans-activation of the HTLV-II long terminal repeat by the wild-type protein. The altered phenotype of this mutant suggests a potential negative regulatory function of the x protein.\r"

Gerbils were sacrificed at 0, 5, and 30 minutes, and 4 and 24 hours after a 15-minute occlusion of both carotid arteries. Apart from 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, tissue prostaglandins determined by the extraction method were significantly increased 3 and 30 minutes after reperfusion. The most pronounced changes found by the ex vivo method were increased productions of PGD2 immediately after reperfusion (285% in cortex, 215% in hypothalamus) and PGE2 (350% in hippocampus, 320% in striatum) 4 hours after reperfusion. At 24 hours after reperfusion PGE2 and PGD2 synthesis were significantly decreased by 23-70% of the values obtained from sham-operated controls. Thromboxane increased slightly in all areas after recirculation and subsequently decreased to values below the control level in striatum. The results obtained by ex vivo incubation of tissue slices demonstrate that ischemia and subsequent recirculation cause site-, time-, and PG-specific changes of tissue eicosanoid production.\r"

Methods to define A were: analysis of artificially created false trios, calculation of the proportion of all exclusion cases (corrected for unexcluded men who were not fathers) in which the HLA system showed evidence of an exclusion, derivation from individual Random Man Not Excluded (RMNE) values, and derivation from individual Paternity Index (PI) values. The false trios were limited within the same ethnic group (whites and blacks) so that no mixed ethnic matings were considered. It was assumed that all of the men in the artificial trios were not fathers. Twenty-one percent of the observed exclusions were based on A locus markers, 36 percent on B locus markers, and 43 percent on both A and B markers. Among 510 false white trios, the man was excluded in 476 cases, yielding a power of exclusion (A) for whites of 93.3 percent. One hundred thirty men were excluded in 140 black artificial trios, giving a value of 92.9 percent for A in blacks. Similar values, 94.4 percent for whites and 93.6 percent for blacks, were derived from the proportion of all exclusions detected by the HLA system. A was also derived by computer analysis on the same cases with formulas that use RMNE and PI values. These results also agreed. This concordance by all four methods enhanced the validity of the A values of about 93 to 94 percent for both whites and blacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Progressive spinocerebellar degeneration was identified in six children with chronic cholestatic liver disease and attributed to severe vitamin E deficiency. In addition to areflexia, ataxia, dysmetria, and diminished vibratory and position sense, three patients had pigmentary retinopathy. Abnormalities were present on electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and electroretinography. Because the vitamin E deficiency was not corrected by oral administration of massive doses of vitamin E, vitamin E was administered by the intramuscular route. With doses of 50 to 100 mg of vitamin E every three to seven days, over a 32-month interval (range, 15 to 44 months), vitamin E deficiency and abnormal red blood cell peroxide hemolysis were corrected. Other than discomfort and occasional edema at the site of injection, there were no side effects of parenteral vitamin E therapy. In several other studies intramuscular vitamin E therapy has produced significant neurologic improvement in patients with similar characteristics. In this study clinical progression of spinocerebellar degeneration was arrested but improvement could not be demonstrated despite adequate vitamin E replacement.\r"

The modifying role of the patients' sodium/volume (S/V) status on renal prostaglandin inhibition was systematically evaluated by renal clearance and balance studies. After patients were S/V-depleted for five days, indomethacin (75 mg/d) decreased protein excretion by 45%. The decrement in proteinuria was greater than 2 times greater than the fall in creatinine clearance and was unrelated to baseline clearance. In acute clearance studies, 75 mg indomethacin administered orally immediately reduced protein excretion, effective renal plasma flow (CPAH), GFR (C inulin), Na, K, and free water excretion. Indomethacin responsiveness (reduced proteinuria) correlated with the change in PGE2 excretion. The effect of indomethacin on protein excretion and renal hemodynamics was apparent, but blunted, when dietary Na intake was increased to 200 mEq/d. Mean BP increased during indomethacin therapy only when patients were S/V-expanded.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between increased risk in relatives over population prevalence (lambda R = KR/K) and probability of sharing zero marker alleles identical by descent (ibd) at a linked locus (such as HLA) by an affected relative pair is examined. For a model assuming a single disease-susceptibility locus or group of loci tightly linked to a marker locus, the relationship is remarkably simple and general. Namely, if phi R is the prior probability for the relative pair to share zero marker alleles identical by descent, then P (sharing 0 markers/both relatives are affected) is just phi R/lambda R. Alternatively, lambda AR, the increased risk over population prevalence to a relative R due to a disease locus tightly linked to marker locus A, equals the prior probability that the relative pair share zero A alleles ibd divided by the posterior probability that they share zero alleles ibd, given that they are both affected. For example, for affected sib pairs, P (sharing 0 markers/both sibs are affected) = .25/lambda S. This formula holds true for any number of alleles at the disease locus and for their frequencies, penetrances, and population prevalence. Similar formulas are derived for sharing one and two markers. Application of these formulas to several well-studied HLA-associated diseases yields the following results: For multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and coeliac disease, a single-locus model of disease susceptibility is rejected, implying the existence of additional unlinked familial determinants. For all three diseases, the effect of the HLA-linked locus on familiality is minor: for multiple sclerosis, it accounts for only a 2.5-fold increased risk to sibs over the population prevalence, compared to an observed value of 20; for coeliac disease, it accounts for approximately a 5.25-fold increased risk to sibs, while the observed value is on the order of 60; for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, it accounts for a 3.42-fold increased risk in sibs, while the observed value is 15. In all cases, the secondary determinants must be outside the HLA region. For tuberculoid leprosy, an unlinked familial determinant is also implicated (increased risk to sibs due to HLA = 1.49; observed value = 2.38). For hemochromatosis and Hodgkin's disease, there is little evidence for HLA-unlinked familial determinants. With this formula, it is also possible to examine the hypothesis of pleiotropy versus linkage dis-equilibrium by comparing lambda AS with the increased risk to sibs due to the associated allele(s).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study, TMB-8, an intracellular calcium antagonist, and verapamil, an extracellular calcium antagonist, were used simultaneously to elucidate the role of calcium in the pulmonary vasopressor response induced by PGF2 alpha and U46619. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor action of these two agonists was evaluated in the canine isolated lung lobe preparation. Lobar arterial pressure was constantly monitored and changes in arterial pressure were recorded as a percentage from baseline. Control responses to PGF2 alpha (42.0 +/- 8.2%) and U46619 (47.2 +/- 7.0%) were obtained prior to the administration of TMB-8 and verapamil. After administration of TMB-8 and verapamil, the PGF2 alpha (7.4 +/- 3.1%) and U46619 (28.8 +/- 6.2%) responses were significantly attenuated. We conclude that the PGF2 alpha pressor response is dependent on a TMB-8-sensitive intracellular calcium pool and a verapamil-sensitive slow-channel calcium influx. In contrast, the degree of attenuation of the U46619 response was similar to the vasopressor response in the presence of verapamil alone, as described previously. This indicates a direct dependence on extracellular calcium. An additional source of calcium insensitive to verapamil and TMB-8 may also be activated and contribute to the pulmonary vasoconstrictor action. These results suggest that each agonist possesses a mechanism of action distinctly different from the other.\r"

We examined the effect of indomethacin on duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion and prostaglandin output in healthy subjects.

A 4-cm segment of proximal (the duodenal bulb) or distal (10 to 14 cm beyond the pylorus) duodenum was isolated and perfused with 154 mM NaCl containing a nonabsorbable marker. In the proximal duodenum indomethacin reduced both basal and acid-stimulated bicarbonate secretion by approximately 65% (p less than 0.01); in the distal duodenum indomethacin decreased basal and acid-stimulated bicarbonate output by approximately 45% (p less than 0.01). Oral indomethacin inhibited basal and acid-stimulated duodenal prostaglandin E2 output in both the proximal and distal duodenum. We conclude that, by decreasing duodenal mucosal bicarbonate production and prostaglandin output in humans, oral indomethacin, in two doses of 50 mg each, impairs an important duodenal defense mechanism.\r"

A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3.

The volume of distribution based on the area under the serum concentration-time curve was renal function independent, the average value being 0.270 +/- 0.075 liters/kg. The elimination-phase half-life (t1/2 beta) was 0.82 +/- 0.30 h in group 1, 1.38 +/- 0.36 h in group 2, 3.32 +/- 1.82 h in group 3, and 7.60 +/- 1.28 h in group 4. Cumulative 24-h urinary excretion accounted for 65.5 +/- 7.6% of the dose in group 1 and for 7.50 +/- 3.72% in group 4. Recommendations for dosage adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency are proposed based on the data obtained in this study. The effect of hemodialysis on cefmenoxime pharmacokinetics was studied in six patients in group 4; hemodialysis shortened the average t1/2 beta from 7.60 +/- 1.28 to 4.19 +/- 1.66 h.

Cefmetazole inhibited the growth of 71 strains of MR S. aureus at concentrations ranging from 1.56 to 50 micrograms/ml; the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole against these strains was enhanced approximately 4 times with the addition of fosfomycin at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml. The binding affinity of cefmetazole for the penicillin-binding protein 2' fraction specific for MR S. aureus was higher than that of methicillin, cloxacillin, cefazolin, and cefotaxime. A synergy experiment in vitro was performed by checkerboard titration with Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing various concentrations and ratios of cefmetazole and fosfomycin. The fractional inhibitory concentration index ranged from 0.09 to 0.75. Exposure of cefmetazole plus fosfomycin to exponentially growing cultures at a concentration at which both antibiotics had no bactericidal effect when given alone exerted bactericidal action. Combined administration of cefmetazole with fosfomycin at a ratio of 1:1 against systemic MR S. aureus infections with mice showed an excellent therapeutic efficacy as compared with administration of either antibiotic alone. Penicillin-binding protein 2', 2, and 4 fractions were scarcely detectable in MR S. aureus strains grown in the presence of fosfomycin at concentrations of 0.25 MIC and 0.5 MIC, respectively.\r"

Modules were given after four and roughly 19 weeks on treatment. Each included two doses of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2/day), cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/m2 twice daily X 5), etoposide (100 mg/m2/day X 5), and 6-thioguanine (80 mg/m2/day X 5). A total of 132 courses were given. This study included all new patients except girls aged 1-14 years with presenting leucocyte count less than 20 X 10(9)/l. Twenty patients with recurrent disease were also included. The first 32 patients were given cytosine as a 24 hour infusion, but combined with the other agents this was associated with severe intestinal toxicity, which necessitated a change to a less toxic 12 hourly bolus regimen. The complications of the module are reviewed in terms of myelosuppression, enterotoxicity, infection, and other clinical problems encountered. All patients became profoundly neutropenic and thrombocytopenic. The latter was significantly more severe after cytosine infusion. Overall, 64% received platelet transfusions and 85% were re-admitted with fevers requiring intravenous antibiotics for between four and 56 days. Gastrointestinal toxicity with the modified module occurred in 38% of patients and was severe in 13%. This intensification module has been adopted by the Medical Research Council Working Party on Childhood Leukaemia for use in a multicentre study (UKALL X) and the details of the problems encountered in the pilot study may be of value to other centres now using this protocol.\r"

The increment in HLA-DRw6 was higher in 32 patients who had both exophthalmos and who were antibody positive (37.5%). A significant increase in HLA-DR5 was found in a subgroup of patients who did not have exophthalmos and who were antibody-negative (83.3%). Our findings support previous evidence for immunogenetic heterogeneity in patients with toxic Graves' disease. In American blacks HLA-DRw6 is in some way associated with the disease in contrast to the well-recognized HLA-DR3 association in whites.\r"

A 75-year-old man with prolymphocytic leukemia was followed up over a period of 69 months. During that time, he was treated with high-dose chlorambucil plus prednisone; cyclophosphamide administered daily; combinations of vincristine sulfate, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide; irradiation to the spleen; and alpha-interferon without substantial antitumor effect. The patient had a brief response after splenectomy. When he received low-dose vincristine therapy daily with high-dose prednisone therapy given on alternate days, a fatal tumor lysis syndrome occurred. Although rare, this complication should be kept in mind, particularly in patients who had rapid reduction of tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "In a clinical phase I/II study, high-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone (HAM) were given in combination to 40 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia. All patients had received a 9-day combination of thioguanine, Ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD-9) as standardized first-line treatment. Refractoriness was defined as (a) nonresponse against two TAD-9 induction cycles, (b) early relapse within the first 6 months on monthly maintenance or after TAD-9 consolidation, (c) relapse after 6 months with nonresponse against one additional TAD-9 cycle, and (d) second and subsequent relapses after successful TAD-9 therapy at the preceding relapse. Therapy consisted of HD-Ara-C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1 through 4; mitoxantrone was started at 12 mg/m2/day on days 3, 4, and 5 and was escalated to 4 and 5 doses of 10 mg/m2/day on days 2 through 5 and 2 through 6. Of the 40 patients, 21 achieved a complete remission (53%), 1 patient had a partial remission, and 5 patients were nonresponders. Thirteen patients died in aplasia due to infections (n = 11), pericardiac effusion, or acute cardiomyopathy. Nonhematologic side effects consisted predominantly of nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms were observed during six treatment courses. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 27 days from the onset of treatment; the median time to complete remission was 36 days. Two of the 21 responders underwent successful bone marrow transplantations. The median remission duration for the remaining 19 patients is 4.5 months, and the median survival time is 9 months. These data emphasize that HAM has high antileukemic activity in refractory AML and strongly suggest starting the combination at earlier stages in AML therapy.\r"

MY10 and/or MY9 antigens were expressed on the surface of some megakaryoblasts, but MY7, and MY4, antigens specific to granulocytic or monocytic cells, were not. Some megakaryoblasts were positive for only anti-HLA-DR antibodies. It was speculated that, during the differentiation of the megakaryocytic lineage, MY9 antigen appears transiently on the surface of megakaryoblasts that have lost HLA-DR antigens and have gained the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen. This study also demonstrated that the proliferating blasts in some patients with TAM were mainly megakaryoblasts and suggested that the target cells in TAM are CFU-GEMM.\r"

The complete disappearance of rearranged restriction fragments of the bcr gene, which were a characteristic of the disease prior to Roferon-A therapy, was accompanied by the restoration of normal bone marrow and achievement of durable ongoing complete remission for 9 and 6 months, respectively, in two patients with Philadelphia-positive (Ph1+) CML. Molecular analysis is a valuable probe for monitoring the clinical course of disease in patients with Ph1+ CML.\r"

Twenty-eight children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who survived for more than 2 years were examined for the assessment of neurotoxicity induced by CNS prophylaxis and its treatment. The patients were stratified into three groups: Stratum I, prophylaxis with methotrexate; Stratum II, prophylaxis with cranial irradiation with methotrexate; and Stratum III, with CNS leukemia. Once CNS disease developed the sequelae were frequent and severe, due to the elevated methotrexate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. CNS prophylaxis with intermediate-dose methotrexate was less toxic to the developing CNS than prophylactic cranial irradiation, especially in children under 5 years of age. Electroencephalograms and evoked potentials are likely to find increasing application in defining the CNS sequelae of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and its treatment. Although the sample size was small, the findings delineate specific areas of neurotoxicity.\r"

A multivariate regression analysis selected maintenance therapy with POMP to be the only statistically significant factor associated with long-term remission duration. The type of maintenance chemotherapy is important in overall prognosis of patients with APL, and should be investigated further.\r"

Five patients with agranulocytosis had episodes of bacterial growth in the blood. Four patients had a clinical infection in the subcutaneous tunnel of the catheter. Bacterial growths on the tips of the catheters were found in three cases. Six patients died during the observation period, none of these was in remission. One of these patients had a growth of coagulase negative staphylococci in the blood, and another on the tip of the catheter, without any other known source of infection. The use of central venous catheters facilitates patient care and minimizes discomfort. It is associated with acceptable complications, necessitating meticulous insertion techniques, and careful daily care on the ward or at home.\r"

  ".W": "The enzyme xanthine: acceptor oxidoreductase found in rat heart equilibrates between three forms differing in electron acceptor specificity. Form D transfers electrons exclusively to NAD+ and accounts for 85% of total oxidoreductase activity. Form O transfers electrons to molecular oxygen and accounts for 8%. The D/O form prefers NAD+, but without NAD+ transfers electrons to oxygen. Interconversion from D to O and O to D forms is catalyzed by sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents: Cd2+, Cu2+, disulfiram, and heating with dithiothreitol. This suggests that sulfhydryl groups participate in the first stage of enzyme conversion. The NADH/NAD+ concentration ratio may regulate the dehydrogenase activity of xanthine:acceptor oxidoreductase (NAD+-dependent activity of D and D/O forms). Accumulating NADH inhibits hypoxanthine hydroxylation. The amount of form O increases during cardiac ischemia, facilitating superoxide radical-ion generation. Also, NADH/NAD+ does not regulate form O, promoting adenylate nucleotide pool depletion, especially in the heart which has low de novo purine nucleotide synthesis.\r"

In skeletally immature patients, prosthetic replacement of resected bones and joints is unrealistic because of continued expected growth in the limbs. A stump-lengthening procedure, the reduction-rotation-plasty, has become a valuable alternative to high above-knee amputation. A rhombus-shaped skin incision around the thigh and calf, originally described by Kotz and Salzer, led to a significant discrepancy of the circumference of the proximal and distal skin borders. A circumferential skin incision at the midthigh and a fishmouth-shaped incision at the upper calf was designed to decrease this disproportion. This incision has been used in five consecutive patients with osteosarcoma about the knee. The cosmetic results were excellent, prosthetic fittings were facilitated, and neither vascular nor wound healing problems were encountered.\r"

However, zimeldine was withdrawn from the market because of serious toxicity. We tested citalopram, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, in 39 male nondepressed early-stage problem drinkers (aged 19 to 61 years). Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either citalopram, 20 (n = 20) or 40 (n = 19) mg/day orally, or placebo in a double-blind, crossover trial. Citalopram administration and ethanol intake were assessed by self-report and objectively. Citalopram, 20 mg/day, did not show an effect. However, citalopram, 40 mg/day, decreased the number of drinks consumed (F1,17 = 5.27; P less than 0.05) and increased the number of abstinent days (F1,17 = 13.18; P less than 0.005). The effect is probably through modulation of the neurobiologic mechanisms regulating ethanol intake. Our results suggest a new pharmacologic approach to decrease ethanol intake.\r"

The highest levels of secreted protein were noted in four human erythroleukemia lines which, in addition to erythroid lineage markers, express one or more megakaryocytic lineage markers. Induction of these lines by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhanced the expression of megakaryocytic markers and increased secretion of PDGF-like proteins several fold. In concert with these changes, there was significant induction of c-sis/PDGF-B messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in all lines, whereas one line showed significant concurrent induction of PDGF-A mRNA expression. Whether PDGF-like secretion is part of the stem cell-like phenotype displayed by these lines or is secondary to their leukemic transformation remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these lines provide new cellular models for studying the expression and function of PDGF analogs in hemopoietic cells.\r"

In this study the airways effects of 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 were compared with those of its epimer 9 alpha,11 alpha-PGF2 (PGF2 alpha) and PGD2. 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 was a potent contractile agonist of isolated guinea pig trachea and 4-mm human airways in vitro; the potencies of the PGs relative to PGD2 (= 1.00) being 0.65 (NS) and 4.08 (P less than 0.001) for 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, and 0.52 (P less than 0.01) and 2.40 (P less than 0.001) for PGF2 alpha, respectively. When inhaled by asthmatic subjects, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 was a potent bronchoconstrictor agent, being approximately equipotent with PGD2 and 28-32 times more potent than histamine (P less than 0.01). These studies suggest that 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 is at least equipotent with PGD2 as a bronchoconstrictor agonist, and in being a major metabolite of PGD2, could contribute to the bronchoconstrictor effect of this mast cell-derived mediator in asthma.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we examined the modulation of MHC class II and class I gene products on BALB/c macrophages infected with the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania donovani. Our findings indicated that this organism suppressed macrophage expression of both classes of MHC antigens. These effects varied somewhat, depending on whether cells were in the basal state or were stimulated with interferon-gamma. Thus, class II density on interferon-gamma-treated infected macrophages was suppressed by as much as 90%, relative to lymphokine-stimulated control cells. Induction of H-2K and H-2D by lymphokine treatment of infected macrophages was also markedly reduced. In the basal (non-lymphokine-treated) state, infected cells also showed reduced expression of H-2K and H-2D, but not I-A or I-E. The latter result was related to minimal levels of class II molecules on normal, in vitro cultured macrophages. Suppression of MHC gene products correlated with both the duration and intensity of leishmania infection and could not be overcome by increasing doses of interferon-gamma. Culture of cells under conditions of cyclooxygenase inhibition completely abolished elevated synthesis of prostaglandin E2 by infected macrophages and augmented their responsiveness to lymphokine induction of class II antigens by 60 to 80%. These results indicate that L. donovani is capable of subverting a critical macrophage accessory function required for the induction of T lymphocyte immunity. This mechanism could account, at least in part, for defective parasite-specific cell-mediated immunity seen during infections with this protozoan.\r"

The mass quotients of total plasma cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are well-established predictive risk factors of cardiovascular disease. We evaluated and compared these lipoprotein cholesterol ratios of 80 patients treated systemically with isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and 81 patients treated with etretinate (aromatic retinoid). Lipoprotein cholesterol data were derived from 5 lipid studies on isotretinoin, including our own results, and 4 published lipid studies on etretinate. For all isotretinoin and etretinate lipid studies, significant increases in the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and significant decreases in the mean concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were demonstrated. In comparison with etretinate, oral isotretinoin gave rise to a nearly twofold percent increase of both lipoprotein cholesterol ratios from pretreatment levels. Furthermore, for isotretinoin, an approximately linear dose-related increase of the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol could be observed. If sustained over long periods, the mean differential rise of the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 0.92 +/- 0.51 for isotretinoin and 0.56 +/- 0.10 for etretinate indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease for both retinoids. Etretinate could be identified as the less harmful retinoid for prolonged oral therapy.\r"

HTLV-I was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of all four individuals, and both viruses were isolated from two of them. Evidence of HIV transmission was noted in the family contacts. Eight of 10 children of these four adults were seropositive for HIV, presumably because of perinatal transmission from infected mothers. Two of five spouses of these adults were examined; these spouses had antibodies to HIV and were positive for virus. No evidence of HTLV-I transmission was noted in these families.\r"

  ".W": "The water-soluble nitrosourea compound ACNU is also lipid-soluble at normal physiological pH levels. It lacks toxic effects on vision that nitrosoureas occasionally produce following intra-arterial administration. In 28 cases of both primary and secondary malignant brain tumors, ACNU was administered at surgery or angiography by three different modes: intravenous injection in Group I (10 cases), intra-arterial injection via the carotid artery in Group II (11 cases), and intra-arterial injection via the carotid artery after opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by means of mannitol in Group III (seven cases). Tumor tissue and blood samples were taken serially at various time intervals after ACNU injection, and ACNU was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The time-concentration curve for ACNU was calculated in each case by the two- and one-compartment open models for determination of ACNU levels in blood and tissue, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters including biological half-life, blood and tissue levels (0-t minutes and 0-infinity minutes), total plasma clearance, and distribution volume of the beta phase were compared. Statistical analysis of tissue ACNU levels at 0-t minutes revealed higher concentrations in Group III patients than in Groups II and I: levels in Group II were significantly higher than in Group I. Mean biological half-life was 30.3, 23.0, and 38.5 minutes in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. Levels of ACNU were significantly increased in tumor tissue as well as in peritumoral tissue in one Group III patient with multiple metastatic anaplastic adenocarcinoma. In this series, treatment of malignant brain tumor by intra-arterial administration of ACNU produced significantly higher tissue levels of ACNU than did the systemic intravenous route.\r"

Six cancer patients (five non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, one endodermal retroperitoneal sinus carcinoma) were imaged with [18F]FDG and [67Ga]citrate whole-body scintigraphies in order to compare the sensitivities of these two tumor imaging radiopharmaceuticals. Among the five untreated lymphoma patients, two 67Ga scans and four [18F]FDG scans were positive; in the patient with the retroperitoneal carcinoma who had a positive [18F]FDG scan before treatment, both scans were negative after treatment. Fluorine-18 FDG may be a more sensitive tumor-detecting radiopharmaceutical for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than [67Ga]citrate.\r"

Whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the F(ab')2 fragment of OST7 were labeled with radioiodine and indium-111 (111I), and injected into athymic nude mice bearing xenografts of human osteogenic sarcoma (KT005). All radiolabels retained their antigen-binding activities allowing clear visualization of transplanted tumors. Tissue distribution, however, varied. The net tumor concentration of 111In-lableled whole IgG was higher and was retained longer than that of radioiodinated one, but 111In-labeled antibody showed a lower tumor-to-liver and tumor-to-kidney ratio. In radioiodinated OST7, F(ab')2 fragments provided much better images with much higher tumor-to-tissue ratios than whole IgG. Using F(ab')2 fragments as a carrier for 111In, little image improvement was obtained due to the high radioactivity in the liver and kidney. The different distributions among these radiolabels suggest that the choice between intact igG and F(ab')2 fragments and between radioiodine and 111In depends on the intended use.\r"

All animals had dental maxillomandibular fixation secured by bonding the upper and lower teeth together with an orthodontic composite resin. In half of the animals, the use of circummandibular wires connected to pyriform aperture wires were additionally applied. Tantalum bone markers were placed and cephalograms analyzed during the first six postoperative weeks to evaluate skeletal stability. A statistically significant mean horizontal relapse at the mandibular symphysis occurred in the group without the skeletal wires, whereas no relapse occurred in the group with the skeletal wires. A significant difference in the vertical displacement of the anterior mandible occurred, with an inferior movement of the symphysis in the group without skeletal wires, and a superior movement of the symphysis in the group with skeletal wires. The results of this study indicate that the use of skeletal suspension wires is advantageous in the prevention of horizontal and vertical skeletal relapse.\r"

Reactivity of paracortex, follicular areas, and sinuses was assessed on a 0-3+ scale. Reactivity was prominent in paracortex and sinuses but varied from node to node within node groups. Nodes nearest to tumor showed least reaction; nodes at intermediate distances from tumor were most reactive, while those farthest away showed mostly little reaction. Variation of nodal reaction that correlated with the node position relative to the nearest melanoma (zoned reaction) was seen in 92% of patients with nodal metastases of melanoma and in 64% of patients with primary malignant melanoma. Follicular and sinusoidal reactions showed no significant zoning. S-100 protein-positive paracortical dendritic cells (PDCs) in tumor-oriented nodes were quantified. PDCs were infrequent in nodes partly replaced by melanoma or located near to melanoma but were numerous in nodes located farther from tumor. Changes of nodal activity (relative stimulation or suppression) correlate with the distance of the node from the nearest deposit of primary or metastatic melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "It has been determined in experimental animal models that the susceptibility of the mammary gland to chemically induced carcinogenesis is directly related to the rate of cell proliferation of the gland at the time of carcinogen exposure and inversely related to its degree of differentiation. Cell proliferation, in turn, depends on the topographic location of cells within the mammary gland tree and is modulated by age, among other factors. To determine whether age and gland topography similarly influence cell kinetic parameters in the breast of human females, the following study was done. Fifteen samples of normal human breast tissue were obtained from areas adjacent to histopathologically proved benign lesions. Tissue fragments were incubated in organ culture dishes containing [3H]thymidine ([3H]dThd) and processed for DNA labeling index (DNA-LI), length of cell cycle (Tc), and growth fraction (GF) determination; double labeling with [3H]dThd and [14C]thymidine was used for length of the S-phase determination. The mean values obtained revealed that both DNA-LI and GF were lower, with a concomitant lengthening of G1 and Tc in older women than in young women. The correlation of these values with the gland's topography revealed that in both young and older women, the highest GF and DNA-LI were observed in intralobular terminal ducts, decreasing in alveoli and ducts.\r"

Effects were evaluated by morphology and measurement of clonal growth rate (population doublings per day), cross-linked envelope (CLE) formation, and the enzymatic activities of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and plasminogen activator (PA). All compounds tested were inhibitory to clonal growth; concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition were estimated as 10 nM TPA, 6 nM T-2 toxin, 40 microM capsaicin, 8 micrograms CSC/ml, 540 mM ethanol, and 0.8 microgram CSC/ml with 220 mM ethanol. None of the compounds tested induced CLE formation, although calcium ionophore (A23187) could induce CLE in at least 60% of the cells. TPA (10 and 100 nM) decreased the ODC activity of cells, and capsaicin (100 microM) induced ODC by 220%. TPA (1-100 nM) and capsaicin (100 microM) also induced PA activity. Slight increases in ODC activity by CSC (10 micrograms/ml), CSC (1 microgram/ml) with ethanol, and T-2 toxin (1 nM) were observed, but PA activity was not affected by these compounds. The results indicated that the response of human esophageal epithelial cells to TPA is both similar to and different from that reported for human epidermal and bronchial cells in vitro. Enhancement of PA activity and decrease in ODC by TPA are found in all three human epithelial cell types. However, these changes are not associated in esophageal cells with increased CLE formation as reported in studies with the use of bronchial and epidermal epithelial cells. The results from these acute studies provide the basis for designing in vitro carcinogenesis investigations using these agents.\r"

For conduction of this examination, the detection processes of both the primary tumor and the recurrence were explored. The probability of detection of a recurrence per unit time was found to be nearly proportional to the tumor's diameter. Approximately 60,000 cells initiated the recurrence, and the distribution of doubling times of the recurrences was exponential, with a mean of 2.1 months. The probability of detection of the primary tumor per unit time was approximately proportional to its volume. The distribution of doubling times of primary tumors was nearly exponential; from other evidence, we inferred that the mean doubling time was also close to 2.1 months. Several techniques to measure growth rate agreement between the primary and recurrent tumors within individuals were developed, and all of them yielded the result that the growth rates are nearly unrelated.\r"

All these differences were significant (P less than .01) by multivariate analysis, adjusting for age and sex differences. Drinking and micturition habits were similar in both sexes, but urine concentration was significantly lower in females (P less than .01) in both the urban and rural groups. Incidence of bladder cancer is reportedly higher in urban versus rural populations and in males versus females, the differences being apparently unaccountable for by differences in smoking, an important risk factor for bladder cancer. Our findings of greater urine concentration and less frequent micturition (which augments urine contact with bladder epithelium) in high-risk groups for bladder cancer are consistent with the \"urogenous contact hypothesis.\" This hypothesis associates the etiology of bladder cancer with prolonged exposure to urine, on the basis of studies indicating carcinogenicity of urine. Further studies should indicate whether frequent drinking and urination are effective preventive measures against bladder cancer.\r"

Although correlation analyses have inherent limitations, the findings raise the possibility that recent changes in the detection and management of breast cancer have contributed to a lowered mortality from this cancer among young American women.\r"

Since at least 1 patient in each family was female and there were no cases outside the probands' sibships, the pattern of occurrence of SCID within the families was compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. The observed numbers of cancer cases and deaths did not exceed the expected numbers derived from population-based rates; and there was no cancer excess when incidence rates in blood relatives were compared directly to those in spouse controls, since the rate ratios were 1.2 and 1.0 for males and females, respectively. In addition, cancer rate ratios were not significantly elevated when calculated separately for the 9 families of adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient SCID patients and for the 15 families without evidence of ADA deficiency.\r"

The influence of therapy for the first cancer on subsequent leukemia risk was determined by a case-control study conducted on 25 cases and 90 matched controls. Treatment with alkylating agents was associated with a significantly elevated risk of leukemia (RR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2-18.9). A strong dose-response relationship was also observed between leukemia risk and total dose of alkylating agents, estimated by an alkylator score. The RR of leukemia reached 23 in the highest dose category. Radiation therapy, however, did not increase risk. Although doxorubicin was also identified as a possible risk factor, the excess risk of leukemia following treatment for childhood cancer appears almost entirely due to alkylating agents.\r"

All patients were diagnosed with HD between July 1977 and December 1982. CCPDS cases were slightly younger, more often of the nodular sclerosing histologic type, and presented with Stage II disease at diagnosis more often than did SEER cases. CCPDS and SEER cases were similar regarding the lymph node region of origin, sex, and race. The mortality rate among SEER patients was approximately 1.5 times that among CCPDS patients. This significant survival difference was observed within all stages and within all histologic subtypes and remained after controlling for the effects of age. Late-stage, older age, non-Caucasian race, and a more diffuse histologic appearance were all independent and significant predictors of poor survival. These findings suggest that the management of HD in CCCs results in improved outcome relative to that in the general population. Possible explanations for such effects are explored, and additional lines of pursuit are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "The LewisX (LeX) antigen [characterized by trisaccharide Gal beta 1----4 (Fuc alpha 1----3)N-acetylglucosamine] is an oncodevelopmental antigen in the human colon. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), anti-SSEA-1 and AH8-183, which recognize LeX antigen either on short oligosaccharide side chains or as a terminal immunodeterminant on longer carbohydrate side chains of glycoconjugates, bind to most colon cancer tissues but also to some normal colon mucosae. However, the monoclonal antibodies FH1, FH4, FH6, and IB9, which recognize extended difucosylated and trifucosylated LeX structures or their sialylated derivatives, are more cancer-associated because they rarely bind to normal colon mucosa. In the present study, these MoAbs were used to compare the expression of various LeX-related antigens in premalignant (adenomatous) and nonpremalignant (hyperplastic) colorectal polyps. Antigen expression in polyps was also compared to antigen expressions of normal colon mucosa and colon cancer tissues. The four MoAbs recognizing extended LeX antigens bound to adenomatous polyps (APs) significantly more than to hyperplastic polyps (HPs). In contrast, anti-SSEA-1 and AH8-183 recognizing monofucosyl LeX were less able to distinguish between APs and HPs. In APs, staining with the four MoAbs recognizing extended LeX antigens correlated with the premalignant parameters of larger polyp size, more severe dysplasia, and increased villose component. However, staining with AH8-183 correlated only with polyp size, and anti-SSEA-1 correlated only with polyp size and degree of dysplasia. In general, the staining frequency of HPs was similar to that of normal colon mucosa, although FH6, which did not stain any specimens of normal mucosa, stained a few HPs. The staining frequency of APs was less than that of colon cancer tissues, but these differences were generally not statistically significant. In conclusion, extended LeX antigens and their sialylated derivatives are cancer-associated antigens that are expressed preferentially in premalignant colon polyps, that tend to correlate with malignant potential in these polyps, and that may eventually help to define mechanisms involved in the polyp-to-cancer sequence.\r"

The third S-TAG was made up of Tn hapten groups of the structure alpha GalNAc-O-serine. MoAbs specific for TF-alpha and Tn were able to be generated. All MoAbs generated against TF-beta cross-reacted with TF-alpha but not with Tn. None of the TF-alpha-specific MoAbs reacted with human carcinomas, whereas several TF-beta and Tn MoAbs were found to react with most human lung, colon, and breast carcinomas. It is believed that this is the first report of the use of synthetic carbohydrate cancer antigens for the production of anticancer MoAbs.\r"

At 22 weeks, cystadenoma and hyperplastic ducts were common (60 and 53%), and 3 hamsters developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Fetal acinar antigens persisted in the acini and extended to irregular hyperplastic ducts and tumor cells. At 40 weeks, ductal proliferation was the main lesion in all pancreatic tissue, and 9 animals had adenocarcinoma. Acinar antigens were found in the remaining acini, in irregular hyperplastic ducts, and in tumor cells. Thus, once reexpressed, fetal acinar antigens persist in pancreatic lesions and pancreatic carcinomas in the hamster.\r"

The antitumor activities of 5'-dFUrd and of its parent drug FUra were evaluated after 7 days of continuous administration (by iv infusion, iv push, or po route) of doses ranging from 125 to 750 mg 5'-dFUrd/kg/day and from 12.5 to 55 mg FUra/kg/day. At the maximally tolerated dose, 5'-dFUrd (500 mg/kg/day) and FUra (25-35 mg/kd/day) were equally effective in producing cures when treatments were performed by either continuous iv infusion or iv push. 5'-dFUrd was more effective than FUra when these agents were administered orally (82% cures for 5'-dFUrd vs. 30% cures for FUra). Concentrations of 5'-dFUrd and its metabolite FUra in the blood and urine of normal and tumor-bearing rats were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography following administration of 500 mg 5'-dFUrd/kg. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that at comparable antitumor activity, systemic exposures to FUra derived from 500 mg 5'-dFUrd/kg administered by iv push, orally, or continuous iv infusion were 3.5 +/- 1.0, 3.2 +/- 1.1, and 1.5 +/- 0.3 mM X min, respectively. Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetic results obtained in this model system indicated that 5'-dFUrd is an active agent that can produce cures regardless of the route of administration employed and among the three methods of drug administration tested, comparable tumor-free survival can be achieved by continuous iv infusion of 5'-dFUrd with the concomitant lowest systemic exposure to the cytotoxic metabolite FUra.\r"

In general, these retinoids have more favorable therapeutic ratios, based on acute toxicity in adults, than all-trans-retinoic acid in cancer chemoprevention. In the present study, a single dose of (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8, 8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propen-1-yl]benzoic acid (Ro 13-7410; arotinoic acid), ethyl-(E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8- tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propen-1-yl]benzoate (Ro 13-6298; arotinoid ethyl ester), (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8, 8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propen-1-yl]phenylmethanol (Ro 13-8320; arotinoic methanol), or (E)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,1,4, 4-tetramethyl-6-[1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-propen-2-yl]naphthalene (Ro 13-9272; methyl arotinoid) was administered to pregnant Syrian golden hamsters during the early primitive streak stage of gestation. A significant increase in the numbers of litters containing one or more malformed offspring occurred at all doses of each retinoid studied. The types of malformations induced by oral arotinoid treatment were essentially identical to those found after maternal treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid or other teratogenic retinoids during the same gestational age. The results indicate that the alcohol congener was approximately 400 times more potent on a milligram per kilogram basis than all-trans-retinoic acid as a teratogen, and it was 70 times as embryolethal as all-trans-retinoic acid. The ethyl ester congener was 132 times, and the free acid 123 times, as embryolethal as all-trans-retinoic acid. On a molar basis, the arotinoic acid was at least 375 times as teratogenic as all-trans-retinoic acid and at least 140 times as teratogenic as etretinate in hamsters. Because the dose-response curves for arotinoids were significantly parallel to that for all-trans-retinoic acid, and because the spectrum of congenital defects induced by arotinoids was identical to that induced by all-trans-retinoic acid and other teratogenic retinoids, the mechanism of embryopathic action of these conformationally restricted retinoids was concluded to be similar to that of all-trans-retinoic acid.\r"

The monoclonal antibodies have specificity for a cytoplasmic and cell surface Friend-Moloney-Rauscher group-specific antigen. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody binding to the surface of virus-expressing cells but not to the budding virus particles. Treatment of M-MuSV-injected mice with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to virus-inoculated animals receiving either saline or MOPC 104E. Nude mice exhibited delayed tumor induction following treatment with the monoclonal antibodies but ultimately died from tumor growth. Virus-injected euthymic mice that were treated with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV generated a potentiated spleen cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Moloney sarcoma cells compared to virus-infected treated with saline. This potentiation of cytotoxicity remained after trypsinization of the spleen cells and thus was probably not due to passively adsorbed monoclonal antibody. The antibodies alone or in the presence of complement did not neutralize M-MuLV. The IgM antibodies induced specific tumor cell cytotoxicity in vitro mediated by complement spleen cells, lymph node cells, or thymus cells. In conclusion, two monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV antibodies that bind to the tumor cell surface did not neutralize virus can inhibit primary M-MuSV-induced tumor growth in vivo. The regression event appeared to involve heterogeneous mechanisms. Complete regression remained thymus dependent even with passive antibody therapy, but significant tumor growth inhibition was produced independent of T-cells.

  ".W": "When a 3-methylcholanthrene (CAS: 56-49-5)-induced fibrosarcoma, BMT-11, and its eight clones were transplanted sc into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, leukemoid reaction characterized by a progressive increase in peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) and by splenomegaly was observed as the tumors grew. The WBC count reached about forty-fold of the normal level, and more than 90% of WBCs were found to be polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The increase in WBCs was correlated with tumor size, and its count decreased to normal level within 7 days after surgical excision of subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, a high level of colony-stimulating activity was detected in the supernatant of BMT-11 culture. These results suggest that the colony-stimulating factor produced by BMT-11 cells caused granulocytosis in mice. This is the first report of the marked degree of granulocytosis induced by a transplanted tumor in C57BL/6 strain mice.\r"

Uteri were chosen as controls for the methodology. With regard to MXT tumors, E2 (0.25, 2.50, or 25.00 micrograms/animal) or Pg (125, 600, or 5,000 micrograms/animal) exerts almost a similar mitogenic influence that is dose related to the former and nor for the later, at least within the range of concentrations studied here; and the mitogenic effect of Pg seems to appear earlier than that of E2. When these steroids are concomitantly given, no obvious synergistic or antagonistic effect can be observed. A second E2 administration seems to have a less pronounced effect on cell proliferation as compared to that exerted by the first injection performed 12 or 24 hours earlier. On the contrary, the repetition of a Pg treatment would rather exert an additive or even a synergistic effect on the tumoral dThd labeling indices with regard to the total duration of stimulation. When one of these two steroids is administered first, it blocks totally the mitogenic effect of the second, provided the latter is given 24 hours later. It is concluded that E2 and Pg have almost a similar mitogenic effect on the MXT tumor and that these hormones exert complex interactions that are probably very important for the growth regulation of this cancer. Further investigations are needed to better understand the precise biochemical mechanisms involved in the modulating actions of these steroids on the MXT mammary growth.\r"

  ".W": "A combination of heparin and cortisone acetate significantly inhibited both embryonic angiogenesis and the tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) transplanted into C57BL/6 mice, although each of these agents used alone affected neither angiogenesis nor tumor growth. On the other hand, this combination neither decreased the number of metastatic foci in the lung nor prolonged the survival time of mice with 3LL. All tumor-bearing mice died of hemothorax due to pulmonary metastases. Cortisone acetate by itself increased metastasis, and addition of heparin did not affect accelerated metastasis. Because an antiangiogenic activity appears independent of metastasis acceleration by cortisone acetate, the use of steroids other than cortisone acetate having no metastasis-promotion effect should be required for an antiangiogenic tumor therapy in the presence of heparin. Heparin plus cortisone acetate prevented the DNA synthesis of cultured vascular endothelial cells but not that of cultured 3LL cells. Additionally, oral administration of this combination decreased the [3H]thymidine labeling of endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels prior to the suppression of tumor growth. The specific inhibition of the growth of endothelial cells by heparin plus cortisone acetate was revealed in both the in vitro and the in vivo tests.\r"

In contrast, no sample from 32 patients with uncomplicated rheumatoid arthritis, 27 with Felty's syndrome, 11 with other connective tissue disorders, or 21 normal individuals reacted with HTLV-I.

  ".W": "Exercise-induced amenorrhea has received considerable attention in the medical literature. The combination of exercise and low body weight is thought to exert synergistic effects in the pathogenesis of amenorrhea, while the role of dieting and eating problems, another possible causative mechanism, has not been examined. A sample of 55 adult dancers in national and regional classical ballet companies was studied; their mean age was 24.7 yr. Fifty-six percent of the dancers had delayed menarche (age 14 or later) and 19% of the sample were currently amenorrheic (5 months or longer). One-third of the dancers reported having had an eating problem (self-reported anorexia nervosa or bulimia). Amenorrhea and reported eating problems were significantly related: 50% of amenorrheics reported anorexia nervosa while 13% of the normals did. In addition, prolonged amenorrhea was significantly related to dieting (as measured by EAT-26 scales, a measure of dieting behavior). As expected, leanness and absolute weight also were related to prolonged amenorrhea. Amenorrhea in this sample of adult dancers was not related to current activity level or age at which training began. Thus, eating problems may be one factor in the pathogenesis of prolonged amenorrhea in certain athletic groups.\r"

  ".U": "87144584\r", 
  ".W": "Manic depression is a severe cyclic mental illness that can be unipolar or bipolar and has a lifetime risk of approximately 7 per 1,000 in most populations. Families with multiple cases of manic depression have been described that are compatible with both autosomal dominant and X-linked modes of genetic transmission. Psychoactive antidepressant and stimulant drugs that help to ameliorate depression and mania are thought to act by affecting catecholamine neurotransmitter systems such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, amongst others. Mutations affecting the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of these three neurotransmitters, might therefore be responsible for causing the manic depressive phenotype. We have studied three Icelandic kindreds amongst whom it appears that a single autosomal dominant disease allele is segregating. In these families there were 44 cases amongst 73 individuals at risk. Genetic linkage studies were carried out using clones encoding tyrosine hydroxylase the variable portion of the Harvey-ras-1 (HRAS1) locus and the variable region of the insulin gene (INS). All three markers are closely linked on chromosome 11 and were used to observe the segregation of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the three affected kindreds. We found no evidence for linkage to these markers in any of the three families. In contrast, Gerhard et al. found linkage between manic depression and HRAS1 in a single large Amish kindred. We conclude that there is genetic heterogeneity of linkage in manic depression. Therefore mutations at different loci are responsible for the manic depressive phenotype in the Amish and in Iceland.\r"

There was a small peripheral infiltrate in one of four dorsal root ganglia, but, otherwise, sensory and autonomic ganglia were normal. The blood-nerve barrier may allow some malignant cells to escape cytotoxic agents. The epineurium and ganglia lack a blood-tissue barrier, and malignant cells could have been eradicated at those sites.\r"
