  ".W": "Eight patients with AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) but free of life-threatening infection were treated with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine for a mean of 53.9 days. The serum cyclosporine levels were maintained in the desired therapeutic range. All eight patients experienced severe toxic symptoms, which necessitated discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy in six. The serum levels of creatinine, urea and potassium rose during treatment and fell after therapy was stopped. The total leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, total T-cell count, and T4- and T8-cell counts all fell markedly during treatment. The total leukocyte count, platelet count, and T4- and T8-cell counts rose after therapy was stopped, but the hemoglobin level remained low. No patient experienced resolution of symptoms during therapy, and the condition of all patients improved after treatment was stopped. The results of this pilot study indicate that cyclosporine does not alleviate, and may worsen, the symptoms and laboratory findings in patients with AIDS.\r"

Three patients were treated with cisplatin and etoposide combination chemotherapy with effective palliation in two patients. Radiation therapy was effective in controlling symptomatic metastasis in all three patients. Hormonal therapy was ineffective in two patients despite the presence of positive hormone receptors. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be more effective in the treatment of this tumor than has been reported, although there is no apparent role for hormonal therapy. Functional hormone receptors are probably not present.\r"

The enhanced excretion of urinary zinc may be related to a decrease in amino acid resorption in the proximal tubule.

Arteriograms were made, and blood samples were collected for hematologic and biochemical analyses at regular intervals. The dogs were killed at 1, 3, and 7 days postinfusion and complete necropsies were performed. Specimens were obtained from various tissues for histopathologic evaluation. Results indicated that all but the highest dose of rTNF were well tolerated. Severe histopathologic changes were found in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of the animals receiving 2.0 mg/m2 rTNF. In addition, focal tubular degeneration was found in one dog administered 0.2 mg/m2 rTNF. These data suggest that the upper dose limit for hepatic arterial infusion of rTNF is between 0.2 and 2.0 mg/m2 and that renal function should be closely monitored after infusion.\r"

The growth rate of LALW-2 xenografts was differentially affected by drugs administered to host mice, the cells being resistant to cytotoxic agents (particularly methotrexate and doxorubicin) used in treatment of the donor patient. In short-term in vitro culture, LALW-2 cells exhibited extreme resistance to methotrexate and were also resistant to vincristine, vinblastine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin. The findings differ from those obtained with laboratory-derived methotrexate or multidrug-resistant cell lines. The response of LALW-2 cells, in both the nude mouse model and in vitro, is consistent with acquisition of drug-resistance as a result of clinical treatment.\r"

Cells from cases of benign lymphoid hyperplasia (0.5% +/- 1% killing) and lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (4.5% +/- 6% killing) were significantly (P less than 0.05) less sensitive to killing by hydrogen peroxide than cells from nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease (26% +/- 13% killing) and mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease (52% +/- 9% killing).

Semen analyses of osteosarcoma patients, therefore, were performed before, during, and after treatment with the PADIC regimen consisting of cisplatin, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and dacarbazine or, in some cases, the PADIC regimen plus additional drugs. Results showed that semen volume was not affected and that sperm motility was reduced only during treatment. Although nearly all patients were rendered azoospermic during treatment, sperm production resumed in 30 of 32 patients examined at least 2 years after treatment. Analysis with correction for censored data indicates that, in 78% of treated men, sperm counts will return to more than 10 million/ml. The percentage of men whose sperm counts recovered to normal was lower for those receiving cisplatin dosages greater than or equal to 600 mg/m2; no trends were observed with Adriamycin and dacarbazine dosages. The inclusion of additional drugs such as methotrexate, bleomycin, dactinomycin, or cyclophosphamide (less than 4 g/m2) did not significantly affect the recovery of spermatogenesis. We conclude that the risk of long-term infertility from treatment with the PADIC regimen is low.\r"

Patients were treated with combined surgery and postoperative irradiation or with irradiation alone at the Washington University Medical Center (St. Louis, MO) from January 1950 through December 1984. Histologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of tumor in 21, including nine with well-differentiated astrocytoma, four with astrocytoma with anaplasia, and eight with glioblastoma multiforme. Overall and disease-free survivals at 5 years were 28.7 and 23.2%, respectively. A statistical analysis was performed to ascertain the prognostic importance of the following variables: age, race, gender, duration of symptoms, cranial nerve paresis, primary site, extent of surgery, histology, and irradiation dose. The only factor identified by univariate analysis to be critical for survival was primary location of disease. Patients with supratentorial (thalamus/hypothalamus, midbrain) tumors had a 10-year disease-free survival of 15.4% compared to 29.6% for those with infratentorial (pons, medulla) tumors (P = 0.07). Patients with lesions of the pons had a 5-year disease-free survival of 35.8% compared to 13.8% for those with tumors of the thalamus (P = 0.05). Increasing irradiation dose was not correlated with superior survival. Factors evaluated but established to be insignificant were age (P = 0.27), race (P = 0.63), gender (P = 0.27), duration of symptoms (P = 0.19), cranial nerve paresis (P = 0.71), histologic type (P = 0.16), and extent of surgery (P = 0.94). Follow-up for 13 surviving patients ranged from 2.6 to 28.7 (mean, 12.0) years. Neurologic deficits in surviving patients were absent in 15% (two of 13), mild in 62% (eight of 23), and moderate in 23% (three of 13). One case of brain radionecrosis was identified (6000 cGy, 200 cGy daily).\r"

The N-myc gene product was detected not only in the retinoblastoma cell line Y79 but also in primary retinoblastomas as a pair of bands of approximately 62 kilodaltons (KD) by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positively stained cells with the antibody against the N-myc gene product in a few rosettes or fleuretts containing area of the tumor. The nuclei of the cells were positively stained. The N-myc gene product was not detected in the normal part of the retina or in other parts of the eye. The results suggested that the level of the N-myc gene product may be inversely correlated with the differentiation of retinoblastoma cells and that the detection of the N-myc gene product may be useful in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Because the undifferentiated form of retinoblastoma carries a worse prognosis than the differentiated forms, the level of the N-myc gene product may be related to the aggressiveness of the tumor cells. It remains to be seen whether metastatic retinoblastoma has a higher concentration of the N-myc gene product.\r"

Addition of the active metabolite of the estrogen-receptor blocker/partial-agonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen had a stimulating effect on the growth rate of the gastric cell lines.

Cell image analyses of Feulgen-stained imprint smears, allowing determination of morphologic, densitometric, as well as textural parameters, were assessed by using the SAMBA 200 system (TITN, France). The ER levels were measured by the conventional dextran-coated charcoal assay. The authors then divided the 25 cancers into three categories: (1) \"ER-negative or poorly positive tumors,\" i.e., those having less than 50 fmol ER/mg protein; (2) \"ER-positive tumors,\" i.e., those containing between 50 and 150 fmol ER/mg protein; and (3) \"ER highly positive tumors,\" i.e., those having more than 150 fmol ER/mg protein. The authors' results show that ER-negative or poorly positive breast cancers possess cells with bigger nuclei and higher DNA content, related to higher proliferation index than ER-rich tumors. Furthermore, the chromatin pattern of cells from ER-negative or poorly positive breast cancers is significantly more condensed than the thinly textured chromatin of ER highly positive tumors. Cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained imprints is proposed as an additional tool for grading malignancy.\r"

The cumulative survival rates for the two groups were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The generalized Wilcoxon test indicated that the survival rate of the high EGF binding group was significantly lower than that of the low EGF binding group (P less than 0.05). In tumors from two patients with the highest EGF receptor levels, EGF receptor gene amplification was observed. These patients developed mediastinal lymph node metastasis and died 4 and 11 months after surgery, respectively. These results suggest that elevated EGF receptor level is a significant prognostic indicator for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

After 3 to 19 years of follow-up, six patients had developed local recurrence and 12 had died of metastatic disease including those six with local recurrence. All patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm were alive without evidence of disease, as were also four of the five patients who had larger tumors, but with a mitotic rate lower than 15 per 10 high-power fields. The association between local recurrence and metastatic disease may be more statistical than causal, since patients with both these events had more often larger tumors with a high mitotic rate.\r"

The mean tumor volume doubling time of these 15 nodules was 102 +/- 77 days (mean +/- SD; range 41 to 305 days) before the initiation of a specific treatment for cancer. These doubling times tended to correlate with mitotic indexes of the tumors and the patients could be divided into two groups according to the therapeutic modalities used. Patients in Group A received systemic chemotherapy without response or nonspecific treatments for cancer. In this group, there was a positive correlation between tumor volume doubling time and survival length (r = 0.8812; P less than 0.025). Patients in Group B either received hepatectomy after transarterial embolization or systemic chemotherapy or received hepatectomy alone. In this group, early death occurred in patients who had shorter tumor volume doubling times. Three surgically treated patients in Group B were evaluated as having survived for a significantly long period as assessed from their tumor volume doubling times. These results indicate that tumor volume doubling time is one of the determining factors of survival length in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and, therefore, can be used in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.\r"

Although these high-risk siblings are appropriate candidates for colon cancer screening, the factors that affect their participation in screening programs are not known. A study was conducted to examine the factors that might influence participation in fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening by high-risk siblings of recently diagnosed colon cancer patients and nonhigh-risk control siblings. Siblings were mailed a sample FOBT card, a letter informing them of their risk status, and an invitation to participate in the FOBT screening program. They were later interviewed by telephone about their intention to participate in FOBT screening. FOBT cards were returned by 52.2% of high-risk siblings compared with 37.7% of control siblings (P less than 0.005). Only 24.8% of the cancer siblings thought they were more likely to get colon cancer compared with others their own age, and 27.8% thought they were less likely. Perceived risk of cancer and demographic and health-related factors did not predict compliance beyond membership in the high-risk group. Siblings of colon cancer patients are more likely to participate in screening, and efforts to screen them could have a substantial impact on colorectal cancer. More work is needed to identify the factors responsible for compliance so that effective interventions can be developed.\r"

All patients were 60 years of age or older, and all were postmenopausal. Patients were treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and paraaortic lymph node sampling, and 38% were noted to have more extensive disease than appreciated clinically. Nine patients were given adjuvant postoperative radiation. Seven patients (44%) developed recurrent cancer with liver, lung, and upper abdomen being the most common sites of spread. Prognosis was most directly related to the presence of lymph vascular space invasion and the depth of myometrial penetration. No patient with serous papillary carcinoma confined to the endometrium developed recurrent cancer. In contrast, the recurrence rate of patients having myometrial invasion was 70% (P less than 0.03). Hormonal therapy was of limited value in the treatment of recurrent disease. This data suggests the need for adjuvant systemic therapy in the treatment of patients with Stage I serous papillary carcinoma of the endometrium who have myometrial invasion.\r"

A total of 19 new oral cancers were diagnosed over a period of 8 years, and 15 (79%) of these arose from some preexisting precancerous lesion or condition. Nodular leukoplakia showed highest rate of malignant transformation (16% per year) as six of 13 nodular leukoplakia underwent malignant transformation over a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years. The relative risk (3243.2) compared with individuals with tobacco habits but without any precancerous oral lesion was also the highest for nodular leukoplakia. In addition, nodular leukoplakia was associated with submucous fibrosis in two patients, which progressed to oral cancer and was the clinical diagnosis for four lesions that turned out to be malignant on histopathologic examination. Nodular appearance was noted in two other precursor lesions as well. Thus, 14 of 19 oral cancers (74%) were either preceded by nodular leukoplakia and with lesions showing a distinct nodular appearance, or had the clinical appearance of nodular leukoplakia.\r"

MS Contin was given every 12 hours to all patients except those whose daily morphine dose could not be equally divided into two 12-hour doses with the tablet strengths available. MSS was given every 4 hours. Patients received both of the test drugs for at least 5 days, and, on the final day of each phase, peripheral venous blood samples for morphine analysis were obtained. Eighteen patients received MSC every 12 hours, and five received it every 8 hours. The same total daily morphine dose was given in both phases. In the 18 patients who received MSC every 12 hours, the daily morphine dose was 183.9 +/- 140.0 mg (mean +/- SD). In this group, the mean area under the curve (AUC) with MSC was 443.6 +/- 348.4 ng/ml/hour, compared with 406.8 +/- 259.7 ng/ml/hour for MSS (P greater than 0.20). Mean maximum morphine concentrations (Cmax) for MSC and MSS were 67.9 +/- 42.1 and 58.8 +/- 30.3 ng/ml, respectively (P greater than 0.05). Mean minimum morphine concentrations (Cmin) were 17.0 +/- 17.7 and 18.3 +/- 15.0, respectively (P greater than 0.30). There was a significant difference (P less than 0.001) between the two drugs in time required to reach maximum morphine concentration (Tmax). Mean Tmax after MSC occurred at 3.6 +/- 2.3 hours. After MSS, it occurred at 1.3 +/- 0.4 hours. In the five patients who received MSC every 8 hours, the findings paralleled those in the principal group, with no significant differences between MSC and MSS in Cmax or Cmin and a highly significant difference between the two in Tmax. However, in this small group of patients, the AUC with MSC was significantly (P = 0.04) greater than that with MSS. All patients had very good pain control throughout the study and both formulations were well tolerated. There were no significant differences between MSC and MSS in pain scores or side effects. Under the conditions of this study there was no clinically significant difference in bioavailability between MSC and oral MSS. When given on a 12-hourly basis in individually titrated doses, the MSC provided therapeutic plasma morphine concentrations throughout the dosing interval.\r"

The patients were first stabilized on immediate-release oral morphine 30 mg every 4 hours, with 15 mg available every 2 hours as needed for breakthrough pain (\"rescue\" dose). Each patient then received either one 100 mg MS Contin tablet or three 30-mg MS Contin tablets every 12 hours, with rescue medication as needed, for 3 days. Analysis of study power revealed sufficient sensitivity to detect clinically relevant differences in pain intensity and use of rescue medication. The two tablet strengths yielded similar pain relief, use of rescue medication, and frequency of side effects. In addition, pain and use of rescue medication did not change from the beginning to the end of the 12-hour dosing intervals in either group. In the study population as a whole, pain intensity was lower and total morphine intake higher during the period on controlled-release morphine. These data establish comparable analgesic efficacy and side effect potential of these two dosage strengths and confirm a 12-hour duration of effect for both. The improved analgesia on the controlled-release morphine may be attributable to increased consumption of drug resulting from improved compliance.\r"

Although continuity of care programs resemble hospice programs in philosophy, there are major differences in admission criteria: the program is not restricted to dying individuals; patients may live alone; they may receive active therapy with a focus on cure or remission; and they continue to receive their care, including pain management, within a standard medical system under the supervision of their primary physician and nurse.\r"

To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of a controlled-release morphine sulfate preparation, MS Contin tablets (MSC, Purdue Frederick, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), after a single dose and under steady-state conditions, the authors compared MSC administered every 12 hours with morphine oral solution (MOS) administered every 4 hours in 17 adult cancer patients with chronic severe pain. In the single-dose evaluation, in which the patients were randomly assigned to receive MSC or MOS, there were no significant differences in analgesic efficacy or requirement for supplemental morphine between the two treatments. With both preparations, pain severity ratings increased toward the end of the 12-hour, single-dose observation period and were higher than the pain scores reported after dose titration. In the steady-state evaluation, which was a randomized crossover comparison, both preparations provided effective pain control with minimal side effects. There was no significant difference between MSC and MOS in overall pain scores or in pain scores analyzed by time of day and day of therapy. In conclusion, that an individualized twice-daily regimen of MSC is as effective as 4-hourly MOS for the control of chronic severe cancer pain. The twice-daily regimen has several advantages: it allows an uninterrupted night's sleep, it is substantially more convenient, and it can be expected to reduce both medication errors and noncompliance.\r"

Using the test instrument, two oncology nurses interviewed subjects in three groups, each consisting of 50 subjects: cancer patients with pain, cancer patients without pain, and subjects with no cancer. Statistical analysis of the interview results revealed that the instrument has test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and interrater reliability, as well as content and construct validity for the major factors, psychologic well-being, worry, and nutrition. Further revision of the instrument is needed to restructure its subscales.

  ".W": "Pain management is an integral component of comprehensive cancer care. Designing an effective pain control strategy for the individual patient requires knowledge of the ways in which a patient's cancer, cancer therapy, and pain therapy can interact. Two important aspects of cancer that affect the way in which pain is managed are the cancer's treatability and components of its pathophysiology that themselves do not cause pain (the cancer's \"nonpain\" pathophysiology). Cancer treatability modifies the need for pain management and the appropriateness of invasive pain procedures. Cancer nonpain pathophysiology can interfere with the oral administration of medications, narrow the patient's therapeutic window for analgesic drugs, limit the effectiveness of psychologic pain therapies, and complicate or preclude invasive pain-relieving procedures. In addition, cancer therapy can interfere with or enhance pain therapy and vice versa. Cancer therapy can interfere with pain therapy by causing pain or by producing other adverse effects. Cancer therapy can enhance pain therapy by reducing the extent of cancer, by acting as a coanalgesic, and by providing intravenous access for parenteral drug administration to patients who require it. Pain therapy can interfere with cancer therapy by increasing or complicating the adverse effects of cancer therapy. Pain therapy can enhance cancer therapy by improving patient performance, and certain palliative surgical procedures may have the ancillary effect of improving organ function. Five case descriptions are presented as illustrations of effective integration of pain management into comprehensive cancer care.\r"

  ".U": "89248830\r", 
  ".W": "The results of nine US multicenter, sequential crossover, dose titration studies of controlled-release oral morphine (MS Contin 30 mg tablets [MSC], Purdue Frederick, Norwalk, CT) are reviewed in Part I. The studies demonstrated the prolonged analgesic efficacy of the preparation in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Approximately 93% of the patients achieved satisfactory to excellent analgesia on a 12-hour regimen when appropriate dose titration was allowed. The remaining patients were successfully maintained on an 8-hour regimen. The preparation was well-tolerated and comparable in safety to immediate-release oral morphine. In global evaluations, MSC was judged to be significantly (P less than 0.05) more effective, and with significantly (P less than 0.05) fewer side effects than both the prestudy opioid analgesics and 4-hour immediate-release oral morphine. Patients had a broad range of morphine requirements (mean daily MSC dose, 240 mg; range, 60 mg/day to 1800 mg/day); therefore various MSC tablet strengths were developed. Part II presents three studies in which the MSC formulations (15-mg, 60-mg, and 100-mg tablets) were compared to the 30-mg tablet within three randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover, analytically blinded bioavailability protocols, to determine bioequivalence and dose proportionality. The maximum morphine concentration, time of maximum morphine concentration, and area under the plasma morphine versus 12-hour and 24-hour time curve (AUC 0.12; AUC 0.24) were determined in each study. There were no significant differences between the values associated with MSC 1 X 30 mg tablet and 2 X 15 mg tablets (study 1), MSC 2 X 30 mg tablets and 1 X 60 mg tablet (study 2), and MSC 3 X 30 mg tablets and 1 X 100 mg tablet (study 3, values adjusted to dose of 90 mg), except for one marginally significant difference in study 3 (AUC 0.24; P = 0.04) which was not clinically or biopharmaceutically significant. The results showed that MSC 15-mg, 30-mg, 60-mg, and 100-mg dosage strengths are bioequivalent and dose proportional, and, therefore, therapeutically interchangeable. It was concluded that with routine assessment of the patient and adherence to the principles of analgesic dosing, MSC can be successfully used to control cancer-related pain. Furthermore, the availability of various MSC tablet strengths can be expected to facilitate the analgesic management of a patient population with widely differing opioid requirements.\r"

The test model described showed assay sensitivity for steady-state analgesia, requiring relatively few subjects to yield statistical significance in pharmacologic potency estimates. Initial doses were the calculated equivalents of about one third the previous opioid requirements or at least 30 mg MSC every 12 hours or 15 mg IRMS every 4 hours. This was generally subtherapeutic; hence, additional IRMS was available for break-through pain. Doses of MSC and IRMS were titrated upwards until the requirement for rescue IRMS was less than 20% of the total daily amount of morphine. In both study phases, the total dose of morphine increased significantly from the first day to the last, on which it was significantly (34%) higher for IRMS than MSC. Pain was significantly less intense and frequent in the last 24 hours of each treatment arm than in the first, and equally well controlled by both regimens. The two treatments were equipotent in a pharmacologic assay using dosages and pain scores. The requirement for rescue analgesia was similarly comparable for both treatments, decreasing significantly with upward dose titration. The few side effects experienced (one with MSC and three with IRMS) did not include serious reactions such as respiratory depression. It is concluded that MSC, 12-hourly, controls cancer pain as effectively and safely as IRMS on a 4-hour schedule. MS Contin exhibits a 12-hour duration of action as previously shown in other well-controlled trials. A problem of pain exacerbation at the start of each study phase was found to be associated with the design of this study. It may be resolved with a higher initial study dose and/or use of a patient-controlled analgesia device for parenteral rescue doses.\r"

Each patient received MSC every 12 hours in accordance with specific dosing procedures designed to arrive at doses that would provide acceptable analgesia without unacceptable side effects. By the end of the study, approximately 75% of the patients achieved pain intensity scores indicating no or slight pain. However, since there were no dose-limiting side effects, it is probable that more patients could have achieved excellent analgesia if upward dose titration had continued. There was a broad range of individual total daily morphine requirements. The average daily morphine dose in the groups who had previously received weak and strong opioids was 110 mg and 200 mg, respectively. Side effects, although generally mild and few in number, appeared to have been inadequately treated in many cases. The results show that adherence to the guidelines results in effective pain management in the majority of patients. Additional issues include placing more emphasis on both rapid and complete dose titration and aggressive treatment of side effects, as well as exploration of the option of patient-controlled dose titration with MSC.\r"

  ".W": "A drug-oriented society promotes drug treatment of illness but responds with restrictive legislation and mores when faced with serious drug abuse by the populace. Narcotics are currently controlled because of their history of abuse and associated crime, and when their use, for whatever purpose, is suspected of abuse. Inadequate treatment of cancer pain with narcotics may stem, in part, from these events. Its major causes are confusion of legitimate and illegitimate narcotics use by society in general and health care providers in particular, combined with undefined terms (e.g., addicts, habitual users) primarily in state statutes, which should be revised and standardized. These factors intimidate physicians from prescribing rationally. For example, a prescription for an extremely large dose, and ordering an adequate quantity of a drug to have at home for a reasonable period of time, as is often required for the control of severe pain, may be perceived as an invitation for investigation of the physician's legitimacy. The real or imagined fear of an investigation encourages him or her to write prescriptions for multiple narcotics, each at the \"acceptable\" dosage, rather than for single narcotics in larger doses, which is simpler for the patient and preferable from a medical standpoint. Drug abuse is not generally a problem among cancer patients with pain. Physicians should strive to change social attitudes toward pain control with narcotics by enlisting the support of colleagues and, if necessary, by political activism.\r"

  ".W": "Locoregional recurrence in patients with Stage C3 (adjacent organ invasion) rectal carcinoma approaches 100% when surgery is not followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. The advent of the intestinal sling procedure (use of an absorbable polyglycolic acid mesh to suspend the small bowel out of the pelvis) has allowed tumoricidal doses (5000 cGy) of radiation therapy to be delivered to the pelvis without incurring radiation associated small bowel injury (RASBI). This surgical technique has allowed us to readdress the question, \"what is the effectiveness of postoperative radiation therapy when tumoricidal doses can be safely administered to patients with Stage C3 rectal cancer?\" Nineteen consecutive patients with Stage C3 rectal carcinoma underwent resective procedures and simultaneous use of the intestinal sling procedure. Postoperatively, all patients underwent contrast simulation studies that documented the small bowel above the sacral promentory. Tumoricidal doses ranging from 5200 to 5800 cGy (mean, 5600 cGy) were administered in fractionated doses. No patient demonstrated obstruction, infection, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, or acute RASBI. There have been two locoregional recurrences in a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range, 12 to 54 months) in patients evaluated by physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, endoscopy, and reoperation or autopsy (P = 0.01). There have been ten distant recurrences (eight liver, one brain, and one lung). Three patients were reoperated on to rule out recurrence at 16, 17, and 24 months. All mesh was resorbed and there were no adhesions and no recurrent tumor. When the intestinal sling procedure is used, tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy can be safely administered without incurring RASBI. Postoperative high-dose radiation therapy can suppress locoregional recurrences in Stage C3 rectal carcinomas over and above what would be expected.\r"

RT-CT consisted of 41.40 to 50.40 Gy in 4.5 to 8 weeks with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/d for 4 days in weeks 1, 4, and 8), mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] in weeks 1 and 8), cisplatin (75 mg/m2 IV in week 4). Maintenance CT consisted of methotrexate (200 mg/m2 IV), leucovorin (10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for 5 doses), and 5-FU (600 mg/m2 IV) in weeks 10, 12, and 14. Thirty-five patients treated by RT alone (Group A) were comparable in terms of age, sex, AJC staging, histologic condition, and location of primary with 30 patients treated by RT-CT (Group B). In Group A (range, 2- to 144+ months), two patients (42 and 144 months) are alive and well. In Group B (range, 2- to 59+ months), 12 patients (7 to 59 months) are alive and well. Median survival in Group A is 8 months, compared with 15 months for patients achieving a complete response (CR) in Group B. Patients in Group B achieved a 77% CR rate by endoscopy-biopsy, whereas 30% of the patients in Group A achieved a CR (P = 0.0001). The recurrence rates at the primary site/regional nodes were 77% and 27% in Groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.0001). The incidences of distant metastases were 29% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.423). In Group A, the 1-year and 2-year cumulative survival rates were 27% and 13%, respectively. In Group B, the cumulative survival rates were 53% at 1 year and 29% at 2 years (P = 0.023). Aside from reversible myelotoxicity, the incidences of pulmonary fibrosis, esophagitis, and fistulae formation were less frequent in the combined technique treatment group. A compilation of reported chemoradiation protocols for EC indicates consistently improved 1-year and 2-year survival rates, compared with surgical and RT series. The key to further improvement in the treatment of EC appears to lie in increasing the biologic response (RT fractionation and endocavitary RT) and optimal use of multiple effective CT agents with nonadditive toxicities.\r"

Six strokes occurred in patients receiving equivalent doses (ED) of 1070 ret or more (observed to expected ratio 3.87, significantly elevated; P less than 0.001). Univariate log-rank analysis showed that the risk of stroke was significantly higher (P = 0.010) in patients receiving an ED of 1070 ret or more (4180 cGy/22 fractions) than those receiving lower doses. Multivariate analysis, however, demonstrated that the increased risk of stroke was associated only with increasing age (P less than 0.0001), not ED (P = 0.148). Due to these inconsistent statistical results, no definitive conclusions could be reached about the relationship between radiation dose to the pituitary and subsequent cerebral infarction.\r"

No improvement in tumor control could be detected with increasing total radiation dose or nominal standard dose (NSD). One patient developed optic neuropathy and another developed a glioblastoma after doses in both patients of 4750 cGy in 25 fractions. External beam radiotherapy for nonfunctional pituitary adenomas was found to be effective and safe when doses less than 4750 cGy in 25 fractions were used.\r"

  ".W": "From 1975 to 1984, 120 patients were treated at Eastern Virginia Medical School with iodine-125 (I-125) interstitial implantation and pelvic lymphadenectomy as the definitive therapy for stage A2-C prostatic carcinoma. As might be expected, a higher incidence of local recurrence was seen with tumors at a more advanced stage but also with tumors of moderate and poor differentiation. Local tumor control in these groups did not compare favorably with patients externally irradiated during this period, of which 246 patients were available for study. Only 57% of recurrences with I-125 were clinically evident by 5 years follow-up with failures detected at up to 10 years, as opposed to the development of 91% of local recurrences by 5 years with external beam irradiation (P = 0.001), suggesting a later incidence of local recurrence with I-125 therapy. Major complications attributable to local tumor recurrence were also more frequent in implanted patients (20% vs. 8%; P = 0.006). The incidence of distant metastasis increased significantly in patients who experienced local recurrences, i.e., 83% versus 18%, with the expected adverse affect on survival. Disease-free survival by grade and stage showed a particular disadvantage for patients with moderately well and poorly differentiated tumors and stage C disease treated by I-125 therapy. In conclusion, then, it appears that I-125 interstitial implantation is well suited to only a select group of prostate cancer patients with well-differentiated, early stage disease and in most cases does not provide results comparable with external beam irradiation.\r"

The incidence of distant metastasis was significantly higher in patients with local tumor recurrence (56 of 83; 68%), as compared with those with local control (64 of 331; 19%; P less than 0.001). This difference remained significant within each tumor grade and stage. Subsequently, survival in patients with local recurrence was significantly shorter than in those with local tumor control (66% vs. 89% at 5 years; P = 0.001). Of the 83 patients with local tumor recurrence, 56 had local recurrence and distant metastasis, and 27 had local failure alone, with a median follow-up of 76 months for the latter group. Fifteen of 83 patients with local recurrence (18%) developed major complications secondary to local disease. Three of the 83 (4%) patients were known to die of prostatic recurrence alone and another 11 of 83 (13%) as a result of some combination of local and distant disease. Therefore, in reference to the entire group of definitively irradiated patients, only 0.72% expired solely of complications associated with local tumor recurrence and an additional 2.7% expired of a combination of both local and distant disease.\r"

Data was analyzed with respect to age at presentation, sex, presenting signs and symptoms, stage, and results of treatment. Age ranged from 4 to 67 years with the median age being 27 years. Median follow-up was 8 years. Local control was achieved in nine of nine patients or 100% with successful surgical resection, i.e., minimal residual disease, followed by postoperative radiation therapy (45 to 65 Gy) was employed. There were no distant failures when the primary site was controlled. Regional lymph node metastases were infrequent: only 13% (two of 15 patients) presented with positive nodes. Three of four patients treated initially with surgery alone had a local recurrence, two of which were successfully salvaged by combined therapy. There were four patients treated with radiation therapy alone: three had persistent disease after radiation therapy, and one patient was controlled with 65 Gy. Olfactory neuroblastoma has a propensity to recur locally when treated with surgery alone. The authors' experience suggests excellent local control can be achieved with surgery immediately followed by radiation therapy. Thus the authors recommend planned combined treatment for all resectable lesions.\r"

Local control was attained in 10 of 24 patients overall and was more frequent for patients with tumors localized to the trachea and for patients who were treated with combined surgery and radiotherapy. For the 18 patients treated with radiotherapy alone, complete response (CR) was seen to be significantly (P less than 0.001) related to dose: six of seven (86%) patients receiving greater than or equal to 6000 cGy attained CR versus one of 11 (9%) receiving less than 6000 cGy. Three patients developed complications related to radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can provide durable local control of localized tracheal tumors and should be considered for medically inoperable patients with localized tumors and for patients with high risk of recurrence after resection.\r"

Seven patients were lost to follow-up or had prior irradiation, and were excluded. Thirty-eight patients received a median dose of 70 Gy (62.5 to 80 Gy) to the primary site. After a median follow-up of 48 months, initial control of disease at the primary site was accomplished in 74% of the patients. The initial control by stage was as follows: TI, 83%, T2, 67%; and T3, 63%. After surgical salvage, local control increased to 92%, 80% and 75% for stages T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Twenty-nine percent (11 of 38) of the patients had cervical node metastases at presentation. Radiation provided regional control in 96% (26 of 27) with N0 disease and 86% (six of seven) with N1 disease at diagnosis. Sixteen patients (42%) had an additional malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Because the incidence of second malignancies after treatment is high and surgical salvage of treatment failures is possible, close follow-up is essential in the management of this tumor. We conclude that radiation therapy is an effective modality for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the soft palate. Primary radiation therapy may offer many patients the chance to avoid surgical procedures that are both cosmetically and functionally debilitating without compromosing treatment outcome.\r"

Patients in group I and II showed the best response to therapy with reduction in serum of urinary paraprotein and improvement in symptoms, most notably a marked reduction in bone pain. In these groups five patients have survived over 2 years after therapy. The therapeutic response appeared better in those patients who received DHBI as opposed to those whom treated with single HBI. Patients in group III did not achieve prolonged survival but effective relief of bone pain was a consistent finding in these patients also. Thus HBI represents an alternative to combination chemotherapy as second-line treatment of patients with melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma. A comparative study of HBI versus combination chemotherapy is now indicated to establish which therapeutic approach is most effective.\r"

In this study, an animal model was used to determine the effects of smaller incremental doses of radiation on bone growth. Sprague-Dawley weanling rats were given 25 Gy to the spine in 8 to 9 days, with fraction sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 Gy. The animals receiving smaller doses per fraction (1.0 or 1.25 Gy) showed significantly more growth of the vertebral bodies in the treated fields than animals given larger incremental doses (1.5 or 1.8 Gy). These findings indicate a protective effect on bone growth for hyperfractionated irradiation of vertebral bodies.\r"

Of the 41 patients, 40 had adequate material to provide 50 micron sections that were evaluated with flow cytometry to determine DNA content. Tumor- and patient-related parameters were then correlated with the results of flow cytometry. Overall survival at 5 years in these patients was 43%, and relapse-free survival was 50%. Forty percent of the tumors were diploid, and 60% were aneuploid. Five-year survival for diploid patients was 74% with a relapse-free survival of 71%. Corresponding overall and relapse-free survivals for aneuploid patients were 22% and 35%, respectively. Distribution of the patients by histology, stage, and grade was equal between the diploid and aneuploid groups. All patients were treated with whole abdominal plus concomitant pelvic boost irradiation; total doses to the whole abdomen ranged from 10 Gy to 46 Gy (1000 to 4600 cGy) with the median dose being 37.5 Gy. Approximately 40% of the patients received chemotherapy, which usually consisted of a single agent (Alkeran, Burroughs Welcome, Research Triangle Park, NC). This retrospective study of patients with ovarian cancer treated with radiation therapy suggests the possibility that determinations of DNA ploidy may be useful in selecting patients whose poor prognosis dictates that a more aggressive therapy be used.\r"

The local control rate at the primary sites was significantly improved statistically as compared with 58 patients with the same disease and stages treated by once daily (once-a-day) radiation therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 5 years before twice-a-day radiation therapy. For the T1-2 lesions, the 5-year actuarial local control rates were 89% after twice-a-day and 55% after once-a-day radiation therapy, with a P value of 0.0021. For the T3-4 lesions, the corresponding rates were 77% and 45%, with a P value of 0.026. The improved local control rates occurred in patients with N2-3 disease and among male and female patients, and were reflected in patient survival. Although our study is not randomized, the improved local control and survival rates after twice-a-day radiation therapy are encouraging. However, the final answer will require a clinical randomized trial in the management of carcinoma of the nasopharynx.\r"

The results for the 239 patients treated with radical intent are reported here. All patients received 60 to 70 Gy to the prostate with megavoltage beam irradiation; 142 with a small field (10 X 10 cm) 360 degrees rotational technique for Stage A, B, or C disease and 69 with a four-field pelvic brick technique (followed by a boost to the prostate) for Stage A through C and D1 disease. Twenty-eight patients were treated postoperatively for residual disease after radical prostatectomy or for recurrent tumor. The minimum follow-up time was 5 years. Actuarial 5-year and 7-year survival rates for Stage A (n = 34), B (n = 100), C (n = 63), and D1 (n = 14) were 91% and 76%, 86% and 75%, 67% and 40%, and 46% and 36%, respectively. The corresponding 5-year and 7-year relapse-free survival rates were 72% and 65%, 77% and 60%, 46% and 28%, and 38% and 25%. The local tumor control rates at 5 years were 91%, 85%, 77%, and 62% for Stage A, B, C, and D1, respectively. In our experience, there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival rates for patients who underwent transurethral resection (TURP) versus those who did not (67% versus 78% for Stage B [P greater than 0.25] and 38% versus 47% for Stage C [P greater than 0.25], respectively). Also there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival rates between large and small field techniques (64% versus 77% for Stage B [P greater than 0.25] and 56% versus 41% for Stage C [P greater than 0.25], respectively). The 5-year and 7-year actuarial survival rates were 90% and 71%, respectively, for the 15 patients with residual tumor and 58% and 33%, respectively, for the 13 patients treated for postprostatectomy recurrence. Severe complications were documented in only nine patients (3.7%) and mild to moderate complications in 53 patients (22%). Larger fields did not cause a higher rate of complications, although small fields were tolerated better than large fields; the significant acute reaction rate was 27% for large field techniques versus 11% for small field techniques (P greater than 0.01). These results confirm that external beam irradiation is an effective treatment for prostate cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one adult patients with malignant glioma (23 with glioblastoma multiforme, six with anaplastic astrocytoma, and two with brainstem glioma) were treated with up to ten cycles of \"eight-drugs-in-one-day\" chemotherapy (methylprednisolone 300 mg/m2, vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 [maximum of 2 mg/cycle], CCNU 75 mg/m2, procarbazine 75 mg/m2, hydroxyurea 3000 mg/m2, cisplatin 90 mg/m2, cytosine arabinoside 300 mg/m2, and imidazole carboxamide 150 mg/m2). Chemotherapy was planned as two cycles before and eight cycles after 60 Gy of involved brain irradiation. A total of 117 cycles of chemotherapy was administered. There was one treatment-related death. Myelosuppression was the most frequent toxic effect (leucopenia was less than 1000/mm3 in 9% of cycles and 1000-2500/mm3 in 25%; thrombocytopenia was less than 100,000/mm3 in 33% of cycles). Sixteen patients developed infections requiring treatment, two of which were life-threatening. Five patients suffered ototoxicity. Nausea and vomiting were observed in 35% of patients. A reversible rise in creatinine was observed in five patients. One patient developed a severe motor neuropathy, and three patients developed mild peripheral neuropathies. Three patients had episodes of atrial fibrillation. One new bundle branch block with supraventricular tachycardia was observed in a patient with pulmonary embolus. Five patients developed thrombophlebitis, three of whom had pulmonary emboli. Two patients suffered strokes in areas anatomically separate from their tumor. Eleven patients declined to continue therapy after receiving an average of three cycles. Two had complete, and five had partial responses. The median survival time was 47 weeks. The responses and survival times observed are comparable to less toxic treatment protocols for adults with malignant gliomas.\r"

The authors developed an in vitro assay that measures the ability of human colonic epithelial cells that are in progressive stages of abnormal development to respond to direct application of calcium as the chloride in tissue culture medium. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine and autoradiography in situ was employed to measure the number of proliferating cells cultured at 0.1 mM CaCl2, the optimum level for growth, and 2.2 to 5 mM, both levels achievable in the colonic lumen. Abnormal cell proliferation was reduced in biopsies from 13 of 14 patients without familial polyposis but at increased risk for colon cancer because of previous colonic neoplasms or familial association; in cells from three of four asymptomatic individuals in familial polyposis families at risk for that disease; and in cells of three of ten patients symptomatic with familial polyposis. Growth of tubular adenoma cells from two of seven familial polyposis patients was also inhibited by calcium. Growth inhibition was not observed in more advanced colon tumors including eight adenomas, either villotubular or villous, and five carcinomas. These findings indicate heterogeneity within the familial polyposis phenotype for the normal cellular response to growth inhibition by calcium, and a further loss of response to calcium as these cells progress toward malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Serum ferritin levels are often elevated in patients with certain cancers and these elevations are, in part, derived from the tumors. In such patients, the increased levels of serum ferritin are associated with a poor prognosis. This association may be explained in part by biological effects of ferritin on lymphocytes: inhibition of E-rosette formation, masking of cell surfaces and suppression of lymphocytes' response to mitogens in vitro. The authors hypothesized that ferritins from tumor tissues also exert adverse effects on human granulocytes that are involved in tumoricidal activity. Three granulocyte functions were tested: nitroblue tetrazolium test, phagocytosis, and production of hydrogen peroxide. The results supported the authors' hypothesis: NBT reduction and phagocytosis are decreased in granulocytes exposed to ferritins, more so with tumor ferritins, than normal ferritin, and H2O2 production is less in granulocytes previously exposed to ferritins from tumor and nontumor tissues than cells not exposed to ferritins. However, the inhibitory effects of ferritins on H2O2 production can be reversed if granulocytes are further stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (a membrane stimulant). If the elevated serum ferritin in cancer patients impairs granulocyte functions, in vivo, then it may increase the risk of infection, decrease tumoricidal host responses, and, thereby, contribute to the poor prognosis of these individuals.\r"

They were characterized by solid tumor as the primary malignancy in four of five cases, absence of preleukemic phase in all cases, and myelodysplastic features in one of five cases only. All patients achieved complete remission (CR) with aggressive chemotherapy. Only two relapsed, but follow-up is still limited in the three remaining cases. Cytogenetic analysis is important in all younger patients with SL, especially if unusual features (such as absence of preleukemic phase or myelodysplastic features) are found. Aggressive chemotherapy appears to be indicated in those patients if a \"specific\" rearrangement is found.\r"

According to histology, the series was divided into three groups, of 28 (34.5%) benign tumors, 32 (39.5%) border-line tumors, and 21 (25.9%) malignant tumors. Because ten patients were lost to follow-up, only 71 women could be evaluated. All the patients had received surgical treatment: 51 women had been treated conservatively (11 enucleations, 40 wide resections), and 20 had undergone radical operations (13 underwent total and five underwent subcutaneous mastectomies, whereas one underwent modified and one underwent radical mastectomy). The mean follow-up, for the three groups, was 106 months for benign, 84 months for borderline, and 82 months for malignant tumors; in no case was radical surgery followed by local recurrence: of 51 women conservatively treated, 14 experienced local relapse, i.e., one of 24 women with benign, ten of 22 with borderline, and three of 8 with malignant lesions. Only two of 47 patients (4.2%) with borderline or malignant tumors developed distant metastasis and died from disease. No relationship between tumor size and risk of local recurrence could be demonstrated, and no difference could be identified between borderline and malignant lesions, in terms both of local and distant relapse. Local recurrences do not appear to affect survival: as a consequence, wide resection should be the primary treatment. Enucleation is to be proscribed. Total mastectomy has been indicated for very large tumors and for local recurrences of borderline and malignant lesions. Axillary dissection is not worthwhile.\r"

In 24 patients, various schemes for aggressive chemotherapy for measurable lung disease could be assessed. Only one patient had a complete response; there was one partial response, and three patients experienced stabilization of their disease for 6 to 8 months. Of five patients who had second line postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, four relapsed within 2 months of stopping treatment. Surgical resection of lung metastases appears definitely to improve the outcome in osteosarcoma patients. Chemotherapy offers no advantage in treating bulk disease, but the prevention of new micrometastatic disease remains a possibility and should be assessed in randomised multicenter trials.\r"

This retrospective analysis is aimed at identifying tumor-related and treatment-related variables likely to influence tumor response, locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Independent factors predicting a complete response (CR) were the number of lesions (P less than 0.0001) and the minimum tumor temperature (minT) (P = 0.03). Only a positive trend was observed for the drug dose (P = 0.08). However, the proportion of CR was significantly higher (57.7%; P = 0.02) in patients who had a minT of 41.5 degrees C or greater and who were given a dose equal to or greater than the standard dose than in patients treated with lower temperatures and/or lower drug doses. The occurrence of a CR significantly increased the rates of locoregional control (77%; P = 0.007), disease-free survival (55.6%; P = 0.006), and overall survival (68.6%; P = 0.03). Treatment optimization may provide further therapeutic improvements by increasing the incidence of CR. However, the overall survival rates also were influenced by the number of lesions (P = 0.0014), sex (P = 0.04), and the number of previous relapses (P = 0.01). Therefore, tumor aggressiveness also is crucial in determining the outcome of the disease, and only early treatment with HAP can reduce the risk of distant metastases.\r"

For those patients undergoing surgery (47% of whom were in Stages III and IV), 5-year and 10-year survival rates were analyzed according to stage of the disease. They were 54% and 54%, respectively, for Stage I; 56% and 35%, respectively, for Stage II; 41% and 18%, respectively, for Stage III; and 11% and 0%, respectively, for Stage IV. There was significant difference in the 5-year survival rates between patients with pathologically negative lymph nodes (64%) and a single positive lymph node (71%), compared to those with multiple positive lymph nodes (33%; P = 0.001). The 10-year survival rates were 39%, 34%, and 15% (P = 0.001), respectively. The authors conclude that breast cancer survival in this population of poor black women is low compared to the survival rate of black women nationally and very low compared to white women.\r"

Perhaps of equal importance is the impact on cancer management outcome from the referrals of primary care practitioners to the oncology community. This area of cancer management is far less well studied and additional information would be of great help in determining where to place emphasis in professional and community education programs.\r"

Inherent in this challenge is the development of indicators to measure clinical excellence in oncology nursing practice as well as organizational excellence. The Standards of Oncology Nursing Practice by the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and the American Nurses' Association (ANA) provides the framework for the development of specific clinical indicators to measure oncology nursing practice. These standards contain structure, process, and outcome criteria to measure oncology nursing practice. Within these practice standards, emphasis is placed on 11 high-incidence problem areas that can occur in cancer patients at any stage of the disease process, regardless of the care setting. These problem areas should serve as the broad basis for the development of specific clinical indicators to measure the quality of nursing care provided to the oncology patient. This report provides suggestions for possible clinical indicators based on the ONS/ANA Standards and the scope of care provided by nursing to oncology patients. This report also discusses problems and issues related to quality assurance in cancer nursing, i.e., (1) the diversity of the patient populations that are cared for by oncology nurses; (2) the lack of research on clinical indicators in oncology nursing practice; and (3) the lack of a national data base on cancer nursing practice to aid in the establishment of \"thresholds of acceptable performance.\" Possible solutions and recommendations for action are given.\r"

The problems that arise for patients and their families require integrated acute care and community-based services that consider the networks that make up an individual's life: families, friends, work, school, and religious and social institutions. Coordinating efforts to provide home care, psychosocial and educational supports, and information to help those who are experiencing the disease can ultimately help them develop effective coping strategies to maximize their healthy functioning. If we are to heed we must continue to promote much-needed dialogue among various branches of the health care community and representatives of the public and private sectors to identify problems, fill gaps in services, then develop interventions and understanding which will address the increasing needs encountered by all persons affected by cancer.\r"

Although issues such as limited resources and clinical staff resistance may not be specific to cancer care, they certainly impact on the evaluation of the quality of care offered to cancer patients. Other issues such as complexity of care and the time span over which care can occur are more applicable to the cancer patient population alone. In response to these issues, I have offered a number of solutions, such as reorganizations of tasks, the use of statistical techniques such as sampling and power analysis, and various feedback mechanisms which have been implemented at MSKCC. The data presented indicate that these mechanisms have been at least partially successful; however, given the absence of a controlled environment, drawing firm conclusions about the relationship between cause and effect is not possible. I hope that in the future these results may be replicated at other institutions who elect to implement any of the suggestions I have made.\r"

Twenty patients (80%) had unstable angina, while 12 (48%) had a recent (less than 1 mo) myocardial infarction subtended by the PTCA vessel. All patients received a calcium blocker, aspirin, dipyridamole, and heparin prior to PTCA. In 20 of 25 patients (80%), occlusion occurred in the catheterization laboratory, while five occurred out of laboratory, three within 5 hours and 1 each within 24 and 48 hours. Angiographic features before PTCA included complex lesions (hazy, stained, or ulcerated) in 12 (48%) and intracoronary filling defects in eight patients (32%). Post-PTCA intracoronary filling defects were present in 17 dilated stenoses (68%). Compared to a consecutive control population of 100 patients with similar demographics but without acute occlusion, the frequency of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and filling defects was greater in patients with early occlusion (P less than .001 for all). Intracoronary nitroglycerin was utilized in all patients with reopening in only one (4%), while bypass surgery was performed in five (20%). Intravenous streptokinase was administered to two patients with reperfusion in one. Immediate repeat PTCA was successful in 15 of 17 patients (88%). In summary, recent unstable angina, myocardial infarction, complex lesions or intracoronary filling defects before and particularly after PTCA all suggest an association of clot with early occlusion. Immediate repeat PTCA is frequently successful.\r"

The tip of a 8F catheter with two piezoelectric transducers and two micromanometers was inserted into a water-filled chamber that had a speaker fixed at one end. The speaker was driven by a power amplifier and sine wave generator. The outputs of the transducers were connected to a low-level amplifier. The piezoelectric transducer behaved as a tunable high-pass filter that could be modified by altering the input impedance of the low level amplifier; the frequency response characteristics were examined at five input impedances ranging from 0.96 to 11.8 megohms. The peak-to-peak outputs of the piezoelectric and pressure transducers were recorded at frequency ranges from DC to 1 kHz with a wide-band oscilloscope. The ratio of the outputs from the piezotransducer and micromanometer (Vph/Vpr) was plotted vs. frequency for each input impedance and analyzed to determine the piezotransducer's output resistance and equivalent capacitance; roll-off frequencies were then calculated. The equivalent capacitance of the piezo-element was determined to be 500-700 picofarads. Series capacitance acted with network resistance to produce a predictable frequency-dependent change in signal amplitude and phase angle. The inherent noise of the pressure transducer was found to be approximately 0.2 mm Hg, while the noise of the piezoelectric transducer was immeasurably low. The piezoelectric phonotransducers were superior to micromanometer transducers in their higher gain and lower noise, suggesting that these transducers may prove useful to physiologic and clinical studies for measuring intravascular sound.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective series of results and complications of coronary arteriography from the Registry of the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions is the largest ever reported. Since the initial report published in 1982, the results of coronary artery surgery and angioplasty have improved and therefore older and more symptomatic patients are referred for coronary arteriography. More patients are now studied by the femoral approach, and the major complications of the techniques are similar. Despite studying older and higher-risk patients, the complications are remarkably similar to those reported in the older series. Because of the sicker patients being studied, it is probably unlikely that the complication rate will decrease further in the future. The Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions will continue its Registry to follow complication rates of both established and new procedure.\r"

Over a 0.009 inch flexible tip steel wire a diamond-coated brass burr fastened to a flexible drive shaft that rotates and tracks was advanced. The drive shaft was connected to a turbine and driven by compressed air with 150,000 rpm. After rotablation of the posterior lateral branch over 3 cm with a 1.5 mm burr and rotablation with a 1.75 mm burr of the posterior branch of the left circumflex coronary artery the vessel was reopened with a smooth surface without perforation and dissection. 24 h control and 6 mo control revealed an open coronary vessel. High frequency rotating coronary angioplasty seems to be a promising alternative method to PTCA in opening totally occluded coronary arteries.\r"

The LCX harbored an atherosclerotic subtotal obstruction, which was then successfully dilated with resolution of the myocardial ischemia. Although not known to have a statistical predisposition to atherosclerotic disease, diseased anomalous coronary arteries can be responsible for myocardial ischemia and infarction. A thorough search for such vessels is warranted in patients with abnormal diagnostic tests and no apparent obstructive lesions in the normally positioned arteries. Similarly, when ischemia does not resolve after successful treatment of a coronary stenosis, anomalous coronary arteries should be sought.\r"

Room temperature and iced injectate were compared in 21 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Dextrose injectate (10 ml) was administered in prefilled syringes left to stand either in iced water or in room air. Four injections were made sequentially with room temperature and iced injectate. Cardiac output by room temperature and iced injectate were not significantly different (4.70 +/- 1.22 for room temperature and 4.90 +/- 1.37 for iced injectate, n = 21, P = 0.155). There was a significant difference in the variance of the estimations by the two methods (room temperature = 0.296, iced = 0.120, P less than 0.005). From this variance the calculated number of measurements needed to estimate cardiac output to +/- 0.5 L/min with 95% confidence is seven for room temperature and four for iced injectate. For five patients with cardiac output less than 4.00 L/min with room temperature injectate, cardiac output with iced injectate was significantly higher (3.33 +/- 0.34 for room temperature vs. 3.69 +/- 0.49 for iced injectate, P = 0.05). Thus room temperature injectate generally gives a satisfactory cardiac output estimation but with significantly greater variability than iced injectate. Sample size for accurate cardiac output estimation must be greater with room temperature injectate. Iced injectate may over-estimate output when cardiac output is low.\r"

It is designed for stenosis located at an angle of the coronary artery. We investigated the use of this catheter in 39 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA): 29 men and 10 women. PTCA was attempted in 43 stenotic sites. Thirty-two stenoses were located at the angled portion of the dilated arteries. Eleven stenoses were located at the side branches of the acutely angled bifurcations. Twenty stenoses were in the right coronary artery distribution. Twenty-two stenoses were in the left coronary artery distribution. One stenosis was at the origin of the left internal mammary artery. Forty-one stenoses were angioplastied successfully (95.4%). No angiographic evidence of intimal tear or dissection was noted in all of the dilated vessels. Acute closure was not observed. The mean follow-up period was 239.5 days. Six patients (15.4%) were found to have restenosis. We conclude that the use of the angled-balloon dilatation catheter provides the potential benefit of reducing intimal trauma and dissection during PTCA of certain coronary anatomies--stenosis at the angled portion or at the takeoff of the side branch of a bifurcation.\r"

Another 5 Fr. pigtail catheter (PTC) was advanced in the AA from the contralateral femoral artery. Peak pressures, AA pressure-tracing characteristics, mean gradients, and the aortic valve area using tracings from the MTS and the PTC were compared. Peak pressures 120 +/- 8 vs. 119 +/- 8 mmHg (r = .998), \"T\" time .16 +/- .01 vs. .15 +/- .01 sec. (r = .913), \"U\" time .36 +/- .02 vs. .36 +/- .02 sec.

Therefore, this single arterial technique provides data comparable to the traditional dual access system for hemodynamic assessment of aortic stenosis.\r"

Patients with smooth and concentric or eccentric lesions rarely had difficulty at PTCA, whereas those with filling defects or with eccentric and irregular lesions frequently had postprocedure thrombi. Total occlusions were amenable to angioplasty when there was lesion staining present, but the success rate was significantly less in patients in whom there was no staining. These findings suggest that the acute outcome of PTCA can be predicted on the basis of the morphology of coronary lesions on preprocedure angiography.\r"

In 30 of 42 pts reangioplasty successfully reperfused the vessel. Ten patients (24%) required CABG and two (5%) were treated medically for AMI. Death occurred in 2 pts due to irreversible cardiogenic shock despite successful angioplasty. After 6 months follow-up 22 pts remained asymptomatic. It is concluded that aggressive redilation of total occlusions which develop during PTCA will frequently result in a successful angioplasty with a long-term restenosis rate comparable to uncomplicated angioplasty.\r"

The results and associated complications of this procedure were analysed in a series of 47 patients in which different types of dilating catheters were used. In 25 patients a single balloon (19 mm) was used (group A), in 13 patients a bifoil balloon (2 x 15mm) (group B), and in the remaining nine patients (group C) a trefoil balloon (3 x 10mm) was used. An increase in aortic valve area was achieved in all patients. The results obtained with the bifoil balloon were better than with the other types of balloon catheter, with an increase in aortic area of + 118% vs. + 74% (monofoil) and + 76% (trefoil) (P less than 0.05). The tolerance of the inflation procedure was also better with this type of balloon, as it allowed for shorter inflation and deflation times. These results show that balloon aortic valvuloplasty, when indicated, is best performed with a bifoil balloon dilating catheter, and undue complications usually do not occur.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxicity of atracurium and of its metabolites was tested in vitro. Exposure of isolated rat hepatocytes to atracurium produced cellular damage evidenced by extrusion of an intracellular enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), into the incubation medium. Leakage of LDH was directly related to the concentration of atracurium in the medium (250 to 800 microM). If the spontaneous degradation of atracurium (presumably via Hofmann elimination) was first carried out in vitro and the degradation products subsequently added to the isolated hepatocytes, the leakage of LDH was also dose-dependent but larger than that observed after the addition of the parent drug. When l-cysteine was admixed to the products of the spontaneous degradation of atracurium prior to their addition to the liver cells, no leakage of LDH was observed. The results are compatible with the working hypothesis that atracurium itself and, even more so, acrylates formed in Hofmann elimination of atracurium, are reactive toward nucleophiles and damage the cells by alkylating nucleophiles present in cellular membranes. Antecedent covalent binding of acrylates to the nucleophile cysteine, i.e., the formation of acrylate-cysteine adducts, saturated the reactive capacity of acrylates for nucleophiles and thus prevented the reactive metabolites from alkylating the endogenous nucleophiles. Possible clinical consequences resulting from in vivo generation of reactive metabolites are not clear at the present time but are projected to be related to (a) the dose of atracurium administered, (b) the amount of acrylates generated, (c) the functional importance of the endogenous nucleophiles alkylated, and (d) the pathway and the speed of detoxification of atracurium and its metabolites.\r"

Intraocular pressure (IOP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded before and after induction of anaesthesia. The IOP response to succinylcholine administration, laryngoscopy and intubation was significantly less in patients receiving nifedipine (P less than 0.01). The mean maximum rise in IOP above basal level at one minute post-intubation was 7.82 mmHg in the control group compared with 0.15 mmHg in the nifedipine pre-treated group.

Forty-nine consecutive unselected patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate with spinal anaesthesia were investigated. The irrigating fluid was either distilled water (group A, 24 patients) or glycine 1.5 per cent (group B, 25 patients). The absorption of irrigating fluid was measured, all surgical events and any clinical signs of TURP syndrome during and after surgery were recorded. Early signs of TURP syndrome were observed in one patient in group A and in four in group B without further consequence. From all the biological variables, only plasma protein concentration, haematocrit, free plasma haemoglobin and free bilirubin concentrations were found to have changed. Plasma protein concentration and haematocrit decreased significantly during and after surgery in the two groups. Free plasma haemoglobin increased significantly with time: a significantly higher concentration was observed in group A than group B. Free bilirubin concentration increased with time in the two groups and was statistically greater in group A. With the two irrigating fluids, we observed a significant amount of haemolysis and haemodilution without clinical consequences. A low irrigating fluid pressure, a short resection time, and the use of spinal anaesthesia seems to us to be essential. Close observation of patients following transurethral prostatectomy is needed but the choice of the irrigating fluid does not seem to be important.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of halothane on arrhythmias induced by ischaemia was investigated in rats, isolated perfused rat hearts, and pigs. Responses to the occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery were determined in groups (n = 9) of chronically prepared rats treated with no halothane, 0.5, or 1.0 per cent halothane immediately after occlusion; in isolated rat hearts (n = 10) treated with no halothane, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 per cent halothane for 15 min before and after occlusion; and 20-25 kg pigs (n = 11) anaesthetised with halothane or pentobarbital. The ECG, arrhythmias, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and extent of infarction were determined in each model. In pigs, left ventricular pressure, dp/dtmax and cardiac output were also measured. In chronically prepared rats, halothane anaesthesia started after occlusion was antiarrhythmic and decreased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and resulting mortality. In isolated rat hearts, 0.5 or 1.0 per cent halothane had little effect on occlusion-induced arrhythmias. The highest concentration of halothane increased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation both before and after occlusion. Halothane decreased developed ventricular pressure in a dose-dependent manner. In acutely prepared pigs, halothane pre-treatment had no appreciable effect upon occlusion-induced arrhythmias when compared with pentobarbital anaesthesia. Thus, halothane is antiarrhythmic when treatment is initiated after occlusion in the rat but this action is not seen in isolated hearts or intact pigs. The antiarrhythmic action of halothane is, therefore, species and model dependent.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography were used to measure cardiovascular changes before and after IV atropine in 31 infants and small children during halothane (n = 15) or isoflurane (n = 16) anaesthesia. Prior to induction of anaesthesia heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP), and two-dimensional echocardiographic dimensions of the left ventricle and pulmonary artery blood flow velocity were measured by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Cardiovascular measurements were repeated while anaesthesia was maintained at 1.5 MAC halothane (n = 15) or isoflurane (n = 16). Atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1 IV was then administered and two minutes later, a third set of cardiovascular data was obtained. Heart rate decreased during halothane anaesthesia but did not change significantly during isoflurane anaesthesia. Mean blood pressure, cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) decreased similarly during 1.5 MAC halothane or isoflurane anaesthesia. Ejection fraction (EF) decreased and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) increased significantly in both groups, but decreases in EF (32 +/- 5 per cent vs 18 +/- 5 per cent) and increases in LVEDV (18 +/- 7 per cent vs 7 +/- 5 per cent) were significantly greater during halothane than during isoflurane anaesthesia. Following atropine, HR increased more in the patients maintained with halothane (31 +/- 6 per cent), than during isoflurane anaesthesia (18 +/- 5 per cent). Atropine increased CO in both groups of patients, but SV and EF remained unchanged. When compared with awake values, HR increased similarly and significantly (18 +/- 4 per cent) following atropine in both groups, and CO returned to control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomly allocated to either the placebo, esmolol (500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 X 6 minutes, followed by 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 X 9 minutes), or fentanyl (0.8 microgram.kg-1.min-1 X 10 minutes) group, and the observer was blinded to the infusion administered. Esmolol blunted the heart rate (HR) response, while fentanyl decreased it below the baseline and maintained it there, in spite of laryngoscopy. Similarly, fentanyl decreased the systolic (SBP), mean (MBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) significantly below the baseline, while these pressures were either retained at or elevated slightly above control in the esmolol group. In these doses, the HR response to laryngoscopy was more effectively blocked by fentanyl, while esmolol better retained perfusion pressure. There were no complications or ischaemic electrocardiographic changes in any patient.\r"

IVRA may be used to provide anaesthesia for surgery involving both the upper and lower extremities. The need for supplemental medication is ordinarily minimal, so the technique is particularly suitable for short procedures in an ambulatory surgery centre. Yet, prolonged surgery may be performed using a \"continuous technique.\" Although various local anaesthetic agents may be used to induce IVRA no drug has been demonstrated to be superior to lidocaine. The major cause of failure of the technique or serious adverse effects is technical error. A specific protocol for avoiding technical error is presented. Significantly, over a period of 20 years, there has not been any mortality or major morbidity. The incidence of adverse reactions was 1.6 per cent and consisted of minor events such as transient dizziness, tinnitus or mild bradycardia.\r"

Techniques included sedation only, and ketamine, inhalational or narcotic anaesthesia. Ketamine infusion was the technique most frequently used. Ketamine was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (P less than 0.05) than the other techniques. The higher incidence of hypercarbia (15.6 per cent), which did not affect outcome, may be attributable to the use of supplemental sedatives. The incidence of upper airway obstruction (7.8 per cent) was similar to that of previous studies. Vascular compromise resulted from the procedure in 33 patients, necessitating surgical correction in 16. Cardiac perforation occurred in four cases, causing one death. Pulmonary valve stenosis was most amenable to balloon dilatation and aortic valve stenosis least amenable. ketamine was the anaesthetic agent preferred by cardiologists for use in the catheterisation suite when general anaesthesia was required. Vigilant monitoring by anaesthetic staff is necessary during the procedure, and avoidance of concomitant narcotics is recommended if a ketamine technique with spontaneous ventilation is used.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that with hypertrophy, the proportion, distribution, and structural alignment of fibrillar collagen are important determinants of myocardial stiffness. Toward this end, the collagen volume fraction (morphometry), the transmural or subendocardial distribution of collagen, and the structural arrangement of fibrillar collagens (picrosirius red) were examined in the hypertrophied ventricle secondary to pressure overload (abdominal aorta banding or perinephritis), isoproterenol, and pressure overload plus isoproterenol. In the same hearts, the slopes of the systolic and diastolic stress-strain relations of the left ventricle, representing its active and passive stiffness, respectively, were obtained. In comparison with controls, we found 1) for a moderate rise in transmural collagen, active and passive stiffness increased with pressure-overload hypertrophy; 2) following isoproterenol alone there was a marked increase in subendocardial collagen, and active and passive stiffness increased; 3) in pressure-overload hypertrophy plus isoproterenol, active stiffness declined. Passive stiffness was increased except when fibrosis and thinning of the interventricular septum occurred, in which case it decreased; and 4) fibrillar collagens involved in remodeling included the formation of either collagen strands and fibers in a greater number of previously collagen-free intermuscular spaces in pressure-overload hypertrophy, or a dense crisscrossing latticework of fibers that encircled muscle fibers after isoproterenol. Thus, an increase in fibrillar collagen in pressure-overload hypertrophy is partially adaptive in that it enhances the tensile strength and three-dimensional delivery of force by the myocardium, but at the expense of reducing distensibility. The appearance of a dense collagen meshwork within the subendocardium after isoproterenol can be considered pathological in that it entraps muscle fibers causing active stiffness to fall while impairing distensibility. Finally, fibrosis may paradoxically reduce passive stiffness if it leads to a thinning of the interventricular septum.\r"

Explants of either thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglion or sacrococcygeal spinal cord were added to cultures of newborn rat sinus node regions or ventricular apexes harvested before the onset of autonomic innervation in vivo. Catecholamine synthesis was detected by glyoxylic acid histofluorescence. Acetylcholine synthesis was indicated by monoclonal antibody labeling of choline acetyltransferase. After electrical or pharmacological stimulation of neurons, the chronotropic response of individual myocardial cells confirmed the presence of neuroeffector transmission; the nature of the myocyte response identified the stimulated neuron as either adrenergic or cholinergic. Chronotropic responses of all myocardial cells to norepinephrine or acetylcholine were transcribed on a recorder coupled to a video photoconductive cell monitor. Isolated sinoatrial node cells were supersensitive to norepinephrine and acetylcholine; thresholds were 3 x 10(-16) M and 6 x 10(-15) M, respectively. These sinoatrial node cells remained sensitive to both norepinephrine and acetylcholine after the development of innervation in vitro. Ventricular cells also were sensitive with thresholds of 3 x 10(-11) M and 6 x 10(-14) M to norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively. However, following in vitro innervation, ventricular cells were significantly less sensitive to norepinephrine and acetylcholine (thresholds 3 x 10(-9) M and 6 x 10(-11) M). These data are the first to demonstrate that neurotrophic modulation is not homogeneous throughout the myocardium and that it may be dependent on the specific myocardial cell innervated.\r"

Freshly isolated cardiocytes were plated onto a deformable, laminin-coated substrate and maintained in serum-free culture medium for 3 days. On the third day in culture, the resting length of these quiescent cardiocytes, and thus their external load, was increased by linear deformation of the substrate to which these cells were firmly adhered. Cardiocyte loading resulted in increases of approximately 10% in cell length, approximately 8% in cell surface area, and approximately 7% in sarcomere length. Three markers of increased synthetic activity were then examined: 1) [3H]uridine incorporation into nuclear RNA, 2) [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into cytoplasmic protein, and 3) [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cardiocyte loading resulted in mean increases of 186% in nuclear RNA labeling and 89% in cytoplasmic protein labeling. The finding that the increase in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation could be blocked readily by cycloheximide showed that the increase in cytoplasmic labeling in response to cardiocyte loading was not simply the result of increased amino acid transport but instead resulted from the incorporation of label into newly synthesized protein. An absence of [3H]thymidine nuclear incorporation in the loaded cardiocytes indicated that DNA synthesis was not activated in these cells. These data constitute the initial demonstration that an increase in load is at least a sufficient stimulus for the induction of increased RNA and protein synthetic activity in the adult mammalian cardiocyte. This evidence for the role of load as an independent regulator of cardiac growth in the adult suggests that hemodynamic changes may lead directly to appropriate alterations in cardiac structure and composition through the transduction of this physical stimulus into one or more biochemical signals that modulate gene expression.\r"

Using a servo-null pressure system and 20-MHz pulsed Doppler velocity meter, we recorded simultaneous dorsal aortic pressure and velocity waveforms. The waveforms were digitized at 3-msec intervals and subjected to Fourier analysis. We calculated hydraulic energy and the impedance spectrum to 10 Hz. From stages 18 to 29, heart rate (148 +/- 3 to 193 +/- 9 beats/min), systolic pressure (1.14 +/- 0.12 to 3.04 +/- 0.10 mm Hg), and mean dorsal aortic blood flow (21 +/- 2 to 214 +/- 19 mm3/min) increased. Peripheral vascular resistance (Z0: 30.4 +/- 4.8 to 6.4 +/- 0.7 dyne x sec/mm5), and the impedance moduli (Z1: 6.5 +/- 1.0 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 dyne x sec/mm5; Z2: 6.1 +/- 1.2 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 dyne x sec/mm5; Z3: 7.3 +/- 1.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 dyne x sec/mm5) decreased. Total hydraulic power increased from 48 +/- 7 to 2,606 +/- 96 nW, while the proportion of oscillatory energy increased from 29 +/- 2% to 65 +/- 4%. With development hydraulic load decreases, total external work increases and the dorsal aorta and embryonic vascular bed becomes more compliant. A greater proportion of total energy is expanded in pulsatile blood flow, suggesting that ventricular-arterial coupling is less efficient later in development.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiological effects of congestive heart failure and physiological effects of exercise training on skeletal muscle may be mediated in part by modulation of beta-adrenergic receptor density. To shed light on the physiological role of skeletal muscle beta-receptors, their density and distribution were characterized in muscle fibers and resistance arterioles of whole tissue slices of three rat hindquarter muscles differing markedly in fiber type composition and capacities for oxidative metabolism and vasodilatation. Binding isotherms and quantitative light microscopic autoradiographic localization of receptors were performed by incubating tissue slices in selected concentrations of [125I]cyanopindolol with and without 10(-5) M l-propranolol. Muscle fiber types were delineated in adjacent sections by histochemical staining of myofibrillar ATPase activity at pH 4.5-4.55. The total tissue content of receptors (Bmax) was nearly threefold greater in the soleus, a muscle consisting almost entirely of slow-twitch (type I) fibers than in superficial white vastus lateralis, a muscle composed of greater than 95% fast-twitch (type IIb) fibers. Bmax was intermediate in gastrocnemius, a mixed fiber muscle (all differences p less than 0.01). Receptor affinity for radioligand was higher in the white vastus than in the mixed fiber and slow-twitch muscles (Kd = 3.5 +/- 0.4 pM for white vastus versus 6.8 +/- 0.8 and 6.4 +/- 1.1 pM in gastrocnemius and soleus, respectively; both p less than 0.01 versus white vastus). Disparities in Bmax among muscles were due entirely to differences in receptor densities of skeletal muscle cells as shown autoradiographically. Furthermore, variations in Bmax of the three skeletal muscles were directly related to percentage of type I fibers (r = 0.99; p less than 0.001), which had a beta-receptor density that was approximately 4.5-fold greater than in superficially located type IIb fibers, 3.2-fold greater than in intermediate depth type IIb fibers, and 2.0-fold greater than in type IIa fibers. In contrast, grain densities of resistance arterioles were similar regardless of surrounding skeletal muscle fiber type composition. However, resistance arterioles were 2.5- and 6.1-fold more numerous in the slow-twitch soleus than in the gastrocnemius and superficial white vastus, respectively (all differences p less than 0.01). We conclude that beta-receptor density of rat hindquarter skeletal muscles is directly proportional to percentage of slow-twitch fibers, while receptor affinity for antagonist is higher in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch or mixed fiber muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89249686\r", 
  ".W": "Myosin ATPase activity is usually considered to reflect the contractile capacity of a given muscle since it correlates with the maximum initial speed of shortening of the unloaded muscle (Vmax). There are several exceptions to this scheme, and it was the goal of this study to determine if the Mg2+-ATPase activity of the covalently bound actomyosin S1 is a more physiological index of contractility. On polyacrylamide gels, the complex obtained after condensation of fast skeletal myosin S1 to skeletal actin is identical to that obtained with myosin S1 from the ventricles of different species, including rat, guinea pig, and human, cross-linked to cardiac or skeletal actin. In every condition, the ATPase activity of the complex is 700-fold higher than that of myosin S1. It correlates linearly with the Vmax both in phylogeny and in conditions in which an isomyosin shift has been reported, such as hypothyroidism and chronic cardiac overload. Such a relation indicates that, in species that already have a low Vmax, a small change in myosin ATPase may induce dramatic consequences in the shortening velocity. Cardiac hypertrophy in humans, where the drop in Vmax is not associated with a myosin change, does not fit into this scheme. The enzymatic activity of the complex is also unmodified in this condition, which shows that, in humans, the myosin ATPase is not a determinant of Vmax and suggests that other mechanisms may be involved. Measurement of this type of ATPase activity provides a new tool to explore contractility biochemically, which is more reproducible and, from a technical point of view, easier to perform than a kinetic assay. It also correlates better with mechanical data obtained with skinned fibers than with those measured on fresh papillary muscles.\r"

  ".W": "Determination of the effect of inotropic stimulation on regionally ischemic and hypokinetic myocardium is complicated when intravenous administration of the inotropic agent also causes stimulation of nonischemic adjacent and distant regions, thereby altering global ventricular hemodynamics. To obviate such events, 16 anesthetized swine were studied during regional inotropic stimulation by infusion of dobutamine hydrochloride (2.5 +/- 1 microgram/min) into the cannulated left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary inflow was controlled by a pump in an extracorporeal circuit. Two groups of swine with different degrees of ischemia were studied. In the first group of animals (n = 8), reduction in coronary inflow to produce a fall in coronary artery pressure (CAP) from 114 +/- 7 mm Hg to 62 +/- 2 mm Hg caused a decrease in percent systolic wall thickening (%WTh) from 34.6 +/- 8.1% to 25.4 +/- 5.8% (p less than 0.005). In the second group of animals (n = 8), CAP was decreased to 46 +/- 5 mm Hg (control: 115 +/- 8 mm Hg) and % WTh decreased from 34.1 +/- 16.4% to 10.4 +/- 6.9% (p less than 0.001). Subendocardial blood flow was reduced from 1.41 +/- 0.38 ml/min/g to 0.65 +/- 0.13 ml/min/g (group 1, p less than 0.001) and from 1.08 +/- 0.22 ml/min/g to 0.24 +/- 0.08 ml/min/g (group 2, p less than 0.001). Regional infusion of dobutamine caused asynchronous ventricular contraction with early systolic augmentation in wall thickening followed by late systolic thinning. Therefore, during hypoperfusion regional myocardial function assessed by %WTh remained unchanged (26.2 +/- 5.8%, p = NS) in group 1 and decreased significantly to 1.6 +/- 5.1% (p less than 0.041) in group 2. Subendocardial blood flow decreased to 0.44 +/- 0.15 ml/min/g in group 1 (p less than 0.005) and to 0.15 +/- 0.07 ml/min/g in group 2 (p less than 0.012). To account for the augmented early systolic thickening that occurred during asynchronous contraction, a myocardial work index was developed in which the sum of the instantaneous left ventricular pressure-wall thickness product was calculated for estimation of regional myocardial work. Increases in this work index were apparent with the addition of dobutamine at both levels of hypoperfusion. This significant enhancement in regional myocardial function in group 2 caused a significant increase of 16% (p less than 0.009) in overall left ventricular power during ejection. Thus, regional inotropic stimulation with dobutamine caused enhancement of maximum work of the ischemic myocardium in the steady state despite a further decrease in subendocardial blood flow.\r"

Thus, we determined the separate contributions of hypertension and hypertrophy on myocardial and coronary vascular function and structure. Twelve-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with and without 12 weeks of vasodilator antihypertensive treatment (hydralazine) were studied using an isolated perfused rat heart model. Hydralazine treatment normalized blood pressure in SHR but did not cause regression of cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight to body weight ratio of SHR + hydralazine 4.33 +/- 0.098 vs. SHR 4.66 +/- 0.091; WKY 3.21 +/- 0.092 and WKY + hydralazine 3.38 +/- 0.152; mean +/- SEM). Coronary flow reserve, elicited by adenosine vasodilation in the perfused heart, was decreased in SHR (29%) compared with WKY (105%) and WKY + hydralazine (100%) and was significantly improved in SHR + hydralazine (75%). Morphometric evaluation of perfusion-fixed coronary arteries and arterioles (30-400 microns diameter) demonstrated a significant increase in the slope of the regression line comparing the square root of medial area versus outer diameter in SHR (0.444) compared with WKY (0.335) and WKY + hydralazine (0.336, p less than 0.05). Blood vessels from SHR + hydralazine were not different from control (0.338). Cardiac oxygen consumption was decreased in SHR (10.9 +/- 0.74 mumols oxygen/min/g/60 mm Hg left ventricular pressure) compared with WKY (22.4 +/- 1.47) and WKY + hydralazine (23.4 +/- 1.90; p less than 0.01), while SHR + hydralazine was intermediate (16.0 +/- 1.60). These studies suggest that significant alterations in myocardial and coronary vascular structure and function occur in hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The coronary vasculature is responsive to blood pressure, independent of cardiac hypertrophy, although moderate coronary deficits do remain after chronic antihypertensive therapy.\r"

The fetal ductus was constricted (-70%) (p less than 0.05) by maternal administration of 10 mg/kg indomethacin. Dilatation of the right ventricle and evidence of congestive heart failure including increased pericardial effusion (+200%) (p less than 0.05) and an increase in water content in the abdominal wall were present at 1, 4, and 8 hours after drug administration. At 24 hours after drug administration, concentric right ventricular hypertrophy was shown by a diminished right ventricular cavity (-36% vs. C2) (p less than 0.05), increased right ventricular wall thickness (+70% vs. C2) (p less than 0.05), and increased right ventricular mass (+31% vs. C1) (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular dilatation was indicated by an increased cavity volume (+87% vs. C2) (p less than 0.05) and increased muscle mass (+29% vs. C1 [p less than 0.05] or +9% vs. C2 [p greater than 0.05]). Both the wet and dry weights of the ventricles were increased. In conclusion, fetal ductal constriction caused right ventricular hypertrophy, diminished right ventricular cavity, and left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy at 24 hours after drug administration in rats after initial congestive failure.\r"

For this purpose, endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded isolated rat aortas, perfused at constant flow (2 ml/min), were prelabeled with 3H-adenosine or 3H-inosine for 10 minutes at concentrations of 0.012-100 microM. Sequestration of adenosine by endothelium was determined from radioactivity recovered during selective endothelial cell removal with deoxycholic acid (0.75% for 15 seconds). In the physiological concentration range of adenosine (0.012-1 microM), fractional sequestration by endothelium was 90-92% of the total adenosine incorporation by the aorta. Endothelial sequestration of inosine at 0.1 microM was 85%. At 100 microM adenosine or inosine, fractional sequestration by aortic endothelium was 33% and 39%, respectively. Analysis of the specific radioactivity of adenine nucleotides extracted from prelabeled aortas indicated that most of the adenosine was incorporated into endothelial adenine nucleotides. Incorporation of inosine into endothelial ATP was approximately 15% that of adenosine. Inhibition of aortic adenosine deaminase with erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) did not influence sequestration of 0.1 microM adenosine, but resulted in a 49% reduction of total endothelial incorporation at 100 microM adenosine. Transfer of radioactive purines from the endothelium to underlying smooth muscle after prelabeling was equivalent to only 1%/hr of total endothelial radioactivity. Our findings suggested that 1) macrovascular endothelium of the aorta constitutes a highly effective metabolic barrier for circulating adenosine and inosine; 2) transfer of labeled adenine nucleotides from endothelium to underlying smooth muscle is rather small and most likely proceeds via dephosphorylated purine compounds; and 3) measurement of adenosine trapping in endothelial and smooth muscle compartments overestimates the transendothelial adenosine concentration gradient.\r"

Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to follow creatine phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, intracellular inorganic phosphate, and intracellular pH during control perfusion (15 minutes), total ischemia (30 minutes), and reperfusion (30 minutes). In Group I the perfusate [Ca2+] was 1.3 mmol/l throughout the experiment, whereas in Group II the perfusate [Ca2+] was reduced to 0.05 mmol/l during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts from Group III were not made ischemic but were subjected to 10 minutes of low Ca2+ perfusion followed by 20 minutes of normal Ca2+ perfusion. During low Ca2+ reperfusion (Group II) recovery of high-energy phosphates and pH was significantly better than in controls (Group I). However, after reexposure to normal Ca2+, metabolic recovery was largely abolished, coronary flow was suddenly impaired, and contracture developed without any rhythmic contractions. These observations indicated the occurrence of a calcium paradox rather than postponed ischemia-reperfusion damage. On the other hand, normoxic hearts (Group III) tolerated temporary perfusion with 0.05 mmol/l Ca2+ very well with respect to left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow, and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, postischemic low Ca2+ (0.05 mmol/l) perfusion may reduce reperfusion damage, but at the same time ischemia appears to enhance the susceptibility of the heart to the calcium paradox.\r"

A doubly cannulated preparation of the mesenteric lymph duct was \"isolated\" from lymph input, other than that from a constant pressure reservoir of artificial lymph attached to its inflow cannula, but had its blood supply and innervation intact. A cerebral ischemic response, evoked by injection of 2 ml air into the common carotid artery, increased both mean arterial pressure and fluid propulsion by the lymphatic. The latter rose from a control value of 45 microliters/min to a peak of 74 microliters/min. When 10(-4) M phentolamine was introduced into the lymphatic lumen, there was a transient increase followed by a sustained fall in lymph pumping. Repetition of the air injection while phentolamine was present in the duct lumen produced no increase in lymph pumping. In adrenalectomized animals, resting lymph propulsion by the mesenteric duct was depressed, and the response to air injection was attenuated but remained significantly greater than control. These results suggest that reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system can increase lymph propulsion and that this may be augmented by the release of circulating catecholamines.\r"

Each of these independent effects improves the waveform's safety factor, the ratio between the shock intensity that produces a specific degree of postshock dysfunction and the shock intensity that produces defibrillation (or cellular excitation). Symmetrical waveforms reduce defibrillation threshold to about 60% that of the corresponding monophasic waveform, probably by reduction of excitation threshold for ischemic cells, but increase postshock arrhythmias. Biphasic waveforms with 10% \"tails\" reduce postshock arrhythmias. This study tests the hypothesis that these independent mechanisms for improvement of defibrillation efficacy can be combined into a single triphasic waveform that will have a higher safety factor than either of the two biphasic waveforms of which it is composed. Cultured myocardial cells were subjected to high-intensity electric-field stimulation with a control monophasic rectangular waveform, a symmetrical biphasic waveform, and a triphasic waveform consisting of the biphasic waveform with an added 10% \"tail.\" Each waveform portion was 5 msec in duration. Photocell mechanograms monitored contractile activity. We found that the duration of postshock arrest of spontaneous contractile activity increased with stimulus intensity for all waveforms. The voltage gradient producing a 4-second arrest after the biphasic waveform shock was 80.6 +/- 1.3% that of the control waveform (100%), while the voltage gradient for the triphasic waveforms was 87.1 +/- 0.73% of control.

Lung lymph flow (QL) rose from 4.3 to 8.3 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05), the lymph/plasma (L/P) protein ratio was unchanged from 0.6, and the lymph protein clearance increased from 2.6 to 4.6 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05). Two hours after reperfusion, neutrophils were observed sequestered in lung capillaries and proteinaceous exudates were found in alveoli in contrast to sham-operated animals (n = 3). To maximize lung vascular surface area and achieve a pressure independent L/P protein ratio a left atrial balloon was inflated during one group of ischemia-reperfusion experiments (n = 5). This resulted in a baseline rise in MPAP to 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); a 4.3-fold increase in QL (p less than 0.05), a decrease in the L/P ratio from 0.70 to 0.28 (p less than 0.05) and a protein reflection coefficient (sigma d) of 0.72. During reperfusion the L/P ratio rose to 0.49 (p less than 0.05) and the sigma d decreased to 0.51 (p less than 0.05), documenting an increase in lung microvascular permeability. In contrast to untreated ischemic controls, inhibition of TX synthetase with OKY 046 (n = 6) reduced plasma i-TXB2 levels to 85 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) but also increased i-6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels to 78 pg/ml relative to 15 pg/ml in untreated controls (p less than 0.05). OKY 046 prevented the increase in MPAP, Pmv, QL, and lymph protein clearance (p less than 0.05). Lung histology was normal in distinction to the leukosequestration in untreated ischemic controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The hind limb was perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution with a combination of high flow and timed air bubbles (2 minutes at high flow followed by 5 minutes of air bubbles, followed by a further 2 minutes at high flow). Representative vessels at different diameters of the arterial tree--the femoral artery, the artery supplying the extensor hallucis proprius muscle, and the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries within the hallucis proprius muscle--were taken for examination by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A graded degree of damage occurred along the length of the hind-limb vasculature, with endothelial cells having been completely removed from the femoral artery, removed from or severely damaged in the artery supplying the hallucis proprius muscle, and partially damaged in arteries within the hallucis proprius muscle. However, no damage occurred to the endothelial cells of the arterioles and capillaries within the hallucis proprius muscle. The integrity of the vascular bed after endothelial removal according to the above protocol was confirmed by the demonstration of no diminution, but in fact an increase, in contractile responses to bolus injections of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, resulting in a shift to the left of the dose-response curve. The viability was further confirmed by the fact that the conductance (flow/perfusion pressure) of the preparation during the periods of high flow was no different before and after removal of the endothelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that chronic bradycardial pacing increases both capillary density/mm2 (CD) and maximal work output in normal rabbit hearts. This technique has now been applied to rabbits with volume-overload hypertrophy due to lesion of the aortic valve. Four groups of animals were studied: controls (C), paced (P), valve-lesioned (VL), and paced valve-lesioned (PVL). The aortic valve was lesioned 8 weeks before the acute experiments; pacing was started 4 weeks before the acute experiments, and thus, the PVL group had developed hypertrophy before pacing was started. The degree of hypertrophy was similar in VL hearts whether paced or not: heart wt/body wt ratio increased by 33.5 +/- 8.9% (mean +/- SEM) in VL and 25.2 +/- 8.2% in PVL versus control animals of similar body weight (p less than 0.001). The hearts of the PVL animals showed a higher CD (2,277 +/- 107) than VL hearts (1,383 +/- 43), CD in C hearts of similar weights being 1,595 +/- 103, and in P hearts 2,350 +/- 194. Thus, CD was lower by 14% in VL and higher by 43% in PVL than in C hearts. Valve-lesioning had a significant effect in reducing maximal cardiac minute work (p less than 0.001), whereas pacing significantly improved maximal cardiac minute work (p less than 0.001) to 2.467 +/- 0.206 J/g x 10(-4) in the P group versus 1.609 +/- 0.105 in the C group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using quantitative autoradiography, LDL and albumin concentrations were measured within aortic valves of squirrel monkeys and rabbits after 30 minutes of in vivo circulation. The valvular concentration profiles were analyzed using theoretical mathematical models based on fundamental transport principles. In vivo transvalvular concentration profiles of LDL and albumin displayed the highest tissue concentrations immediately beneath the endothelium and displayed the lowest concentrations near the midline of the valve. Tissue concentrations of LDL and albumin displayed large differences in magnitudes between different regions of individual valve leaflets suggesting marked spatial variation in the permeability properties of the valvular endothelium to LDL and albumin; this was also seen visually with HRP. The results of the theoretical analysis showed that 1) the aortic valvular endothelium limits the uptake of LDL and albumin into the valvular tissue, 2) the permeability of the valvular endothelium differs widely from one region of a valve to another and even from one side of the valve to the other within a single valvular region, and 3) intramural diffusion is the predominant mode of transport for LDL and albumin within the aortic valve, even in valvular regions exposed to large pressure differences across the valve.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of renal glomerular diseases. Beneficial effects of converting enzyme inhibition in models of renal disease are, however, not always explicable by hemodynamic consequences of angiotensin II inhibition. Angiotensin increases intracellular calcium in glomerular mesangial cells and activates phospholipase A2, factors required for the formation of the lipid mediator of inflammation platelet activating factor (PAF). We therefore examined whether angiotensin II could stimulate PAF production in cultured rat mesangial cells. During a 15-minute incubation angiotensin II caused formation of PAF in a dose-dependent manner with a threshold around 10(-9) M. In four experiments PAF formation in response to angiotensin II (10(-8) M) occurred within 5 minutes and was 29 +/- 8 pmol PAF/mg protein. The amount of PAF detected then declined to 9 +/- 2 and 13 +/- 3 pmol after 15 and 30 minutes of incubation with angiotensin II. More than 90% of the PAF remained cell-associated. The PAF formation was confirmed by negative ion chemical ionization mode of mass spectrometry. A single species of PAF was detected and identified as hexadecyl PAF. We speculate that part of the detrimental effects of angiotensin II in progressive renal disease may relate to PAF formation. The PAF generated may in turn influence glomerular function, platelets, and eicosanoid synthesis, all factors implicated in renal disease. Furthermore, we speculate that angiotensin II-induced PAF formation may contribute to microvasculature pathology in general.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients with a posteroseptal accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection underwent catheter ablation of the accessory AV connection with 200-400 J shocks delivered by a standard defibrillator. Cathodal shocks were delivered through the proximal pair of electrodes of a 6F quadripolar electrode catheter positioned in the coronary sinus such that the proximal electrodes straddled the ostium (12 patients) or the third electrode from the tip was at the ostium (36 patients). A 16-cm patch electrode positioned on the back or anterior chest served as the anode. Two to 4 shocks were delivered (total, 635 +/- 198 J, mean +/- SD). The cathether ablation procedure was clinically successful in eliminating symptomatic tachycardias in in 32 of 48 patients (67%) during a mean follow-up of 26 +/- 19 months. A long-term follow-up electrophysiology study was performed in 27 of the 32 patients who had a successful clinical outcome, and this showed that conduction through the accessory AV connection was completely absent in 25 patients and present but impaired in two patients. The success rate was significantly higher in patients with a concealed accessory AV connection (13 of 13, 100%) than in patients with manifest preexcitation (19 of 35, 54%; p less than 0.001). Among the 12 patients in whom the proximal electrodes of the ablation catheter straddled the ostium of the coronary sinus, one patient developed cardiac tamponade requiring needle pericardiocentesis; there were no instances of cardiac tamponade among the 36 patients in whom the third electrode from the tip was at the ostium of the coronary sinus. Other complications were AV block requiring a permanent pacemaker and transient atrial tachycardia in one patient each and an asymptomatic pericardial effusion in three patients. In conclusion, with the catheter ablation technique described in this study, a successful clinical outcome may be achieved in approximately two thirds of patients who have a posteroseptal accessory AV connection, and the risk of serious complications is low. This technique is particularly well suited to patients with a concealed posteroseptal accessory AV connection, in whom the success rate is higher than in patients with manifest preexcitation.\r"

Because of their age (20 patients greater than 80 years old), poor left ventricular function, and associated diseases, 45 patients were definitely not surgical candidates. Balloon dilatation with 15-23-mm diameter balloon catheters decreased the transvalvular gradient from 66 +/- 24 to 28 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increased the valve area from 0.47 +/- 0.15 to 0.83 +/- 0.27 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Immediately after dilatation, ejection fraction mildly increased from 29 +/- 7% to 34 +/- 9% (p less than 0.001) in 38 patients who had undergone a second left ventricular angiogram after dilatation. No significant change in the degree of aortic regurgitation was found after the procedure. Three patients died in hospital (femoral arterial complications in two, septicemia in one). Immediate clinical improvement was noted in 80% of the patients. During the follow-up (mean, 11 months), 22 patients died (heart failure in 15 patients, sudden death in five patients, myocardial infarction in one patient, cancer in one patient). Thirty patients survived, 21 with persistent clinical improvement. Repeat cardiac catheterization was performed at 6 months in 20 patients, of whom eight had recurrence of symptoms. Nine patients had restenosis: their hemodynamic indexes had returned to prevalvuloplasty values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A His bundle electrogram was recorded in all patients, and when sinus rhythm was present, the atrioventricular (AV) node effective refractory period was measured. Holter monitoring was performed during and for 24 hours after the procedure. Follow-up electrocardiograms (ECG) were available in 11 patients 2.3 +/- 1.5 months after the procedure. The AV node effective refractory period before (276 +/- 86 msec) and after valvotomy (298 +/- 85 msec) were not significantly different. The maximum His-Purkinje conduction time (HV interval) observed during valvotomy (66 +/- 20 msec) was significantly longer (p less than 0.01) than that measured before (57 +/- 10 msec) or after (60 +/- 18 msec) valvotomy. The mean HV intervals before and after valvotomy were not significantly different. The mean QRS complex duration increased from 95 +/- 28 to 112 +/- 28 msec during valvotomy and remained significantly prolonged (109 +/- 26 msec) 24 hours after the procedure (p less than 0.01). A new intraventricular conduction defect (QRS complex duration greater than 100 msec) or bundle branch block occurred in five of 13 patients who had normal QRS duration before the procedure. The change in HV interval did not correlate with the change in QRS complex duration. In four patients, the newly acquired intraventricular conduction defect was still present on follow-up ECG tracing. Complete heart block was not observed in any patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of Kawasaki syndrome on myocardial function, as well as the influence of high-dose intravenous gamma-globulin therapy on resolution of functional abnormalities, we studied 98 patients with Kawasaki syndrome during five time intervals from onset of illness: 1) 10 days or less, 2) 11-31 days, 3) 1-3 months, 4) 3-12 months, and 5) 1-3 years. Normal controls included 48 children under age 8 years, without known cardiovascular disease. Using two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiograms, we obtained chamber dimensions, fractional shortening, rate-corrected velocity of shortening (Vcfc) adjusted for end-systolic wall stress, and early diastolic function parameters that included adjusted peak rates of left ventricular dimension change, wall thinning, and their respective timing. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensions were larger (both p less than 0.01) in patients than in normal subjects in period 1. Stress-adjusted Vcfc was much lower in patients in the 3 months after disease onset; by period 5, contractility was comparable in patients and normal subjects. Adjusted indexes of early diastolic function did not differ significantly between patients and normal subjects. To investigate the effect of gamma-globulin, we analyzed data on 47 patients prospectively randomized to therapy with aspirin alone (n = 19, 40%) or to aspirin plus gamma-globulin, 400 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days (n = 28, 60%). In period 1, before treatment, the two groups had mean fractional shortening and stress-adjusted Vcfc comparable to each other but much lower than those of normal subjects (p less than or equal to 0.001). Patients treated with aspirin alone continued to have diminished fractional shortening and Vcfc compared with normal subjects in periods 2, 3, and 4 (all p less than or equal to 0.05). In contrast, fractional shortening and Vcfc in gamma-globulin-treated patients in these periods were comparable to those of normal subjects. By period 5, no difference was detected in systolic function or contractility between either treatment group and normal subjects. We conclude that early abnormalities of left ventricular contractility and myocardial function, as assessed by echocardiography, generally resolve by 1-3 years after disease onset and that recovery is accelerated by administration of IVGG in the acute phase.\r"

Although the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were significantly greater in both types of univentricular heart than in the normal control group, the volumes for the LV and RV type patients did not differ from each other. The ejection fraction (EF) was depressed in both patient types of univentricular heart and was significantly (p less than 0.005) lower in the RV type than in the LV type patients (0.56 +/- 0.05 for LV type, 0.50 +/- 0.07 for RV type, and 0.64 +/- 0.03 for the control group). The ventricular mass was larger in both patient types of univentricular heart than in that of the control group, whereas the ratio of ventricular mass to end-diastolic volume was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower in the RV type patients than in the LV type patients and the control group (0.79 +/- 0.18 g/ml for LV type, 0.51 +/- 0.10 for RV type, and 0.82 +/- 0.13 for control group). End-systolic stress was significantly elevated in both types of univentricular heart (241 +/- 45 for LV type, 328 +/- 52 for RV type, and 205 +/- 26 kdynes/cm2 for the control group) and significantly (p less than 0.001) greater in the RV type than in the LV type patients. There was a significant inverse correlation (p less than 0.001) between end-systolic stress and the ratio of mass to end-diastolic volume in all the patients. In 27 patients (12 patients for LV type, 15 for RV type) the mean normalized systolic ejection rate corrected for heart rate (MNSERc) clearly fell below the 95% confidence limit of the normal end-systolic stress-MNSERc relation. The end-systolic stress:end-systolic volume ratio was also significantly depressed in both patient types of univentricular heart (3.49 +/- 1.77 for LV type, 4.07 +/- 2.13 for RV type, and 7.20 +/- 1.32 for the control group).

Patients had failed to respond to 3.6 +/- 1.0 antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular tachycardia was reproducibly induced by programmed electrical stimulation in all patients at the baseline study. Amiloride was given at 10 and 20 mg/day p.o. on a twice-daily schedule that achieved serum concentrations of 21 +/- 17 and 36 +/- 18 ng/ml, respectively. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged from 36 +/- 14% at baseline to 37 +/- 17% during amiloride treatment. Amiloride significantly increased serum potassium from 4.6 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 mM. Four patients failed amiloride therapy with spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The remaining 31 patients were assessed by repeat programmed stimulation. Six patients had complete antiarrhythmic response, and an additional six patients had less than 15 beats of ventricular tachycardia induced. Therefore, amiloride was an efficacious antiarrhythmic treatment in 12 of 35 (34%) patients. Amiloride concentrations were significantly higher (52 +/- 20 ng/ml) in patients that responded than in patients that did not respond (30 +/- 15 ng/ml). The only electrophysiologic measurement that changed significantly was the ventricular functional refractory period (from 269 +/- 24 to 283 +/- 25 msec, p less than 0.05). Amiloride also suppressed frequent, spontaneous ventricular premature beats in eight of 15 patients (53%). No somatic side effects occurred. Two of the five patients discharged on amiloride therapy developed asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and this prompted a change in antiarrhythmic therapy.

Phenylephrine elicited similar contractile responses in internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins, with a mean EC50 (the effective concentration necessary to produce 50% of the maximal contraction) of 1.4 X 10(-6) M for internal mammary arteries and 1.8 X 10(-6) M for saphenous veins (p = NS). Selective stimulation of alpha 2-receptors with BHT-920 elicited a marked contractile response only in saphenous veins. Dose-response curves for phenylephrine and BHT-920 were shifted to the right for both vessels in the presence of the alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin and the alpha 2-receptor antagonist yohimbine, respectively. Norepinephrine elicited contraction at a lower concentration in saphenous veins than in internal mammary arteries with a mean EC50 of 7.8 X 10(-8) M for saphenous veins and a mean EC50 of 3.4 X 10(-7) M for internal mammary arteries (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is caused primarily by alpha 1-receptors in human internal mammary arteries and by alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors in human saphenous veins.\r"

These flows were used to quantify mitral regurgitation fraction: RFm = (QLVin-QAo).QLVin-1.100(%).QLVin was calculated from the diastolic time integral of amplitude-weighted mean velocity that was derived from CW spectra with the transducer placed in the apical window and the CW beam directed toward the left ventricular inflow tract. QAo was obtained from the systolic time integral of amplitude-weighted mean velocity by using the same apical window and directing the CW beam toward the left ventricular outflow tract. In 20 normal subjects, RFm ranged between -6.2% and +8% (mean, -0.8%). In 25 patients with pure mitral regurgitation, RFm obtained by Doppler (y) was compared with RFm calculated from biplane left ventriculography and the Fick method (x). The correlation was r = 0.96, SEE = 6.1% of the mean or 12% of the angio-Fick mean; the regression line was y = 0.96x + 0.18; mean y = 49%, mean x = 51%. It is concluded that RFm can be determined accurately by using amplitude-weight mean velocities from CW Doppler spectra. The advantages of this method are its independence from the measurement of the left ventricular inflow or outflow tract area.\r"

Conventional thrombolytic therapy is primarily directed toward the dissolution of fibrin. To evaluate the possibility that platelet activity impairs the lysis of thrombi, we studied the effects of aspirin and platelet-deaggregating prostaglandin E1 on thrombolysis with urokinase. Combined platelet and fibrin thrombi were produced in vitro by adding CaCl2 and collagen (1 microgram/ml) to citrated platelet-rich plasma (250,000 platelets per microliters). Urokinase (500-10,000 units/ml) caused a dose-dependent weight loss of the thrombi that was maximal at 2,000 units/ml. The addition of aspirin (10-200 micrograms/ml) to platelet-rich plasma before thrombus formation markedly enhanced thrombolysis with urokinase. This effect was most pronounced at 20 micrograms/ml aspirin. However, when aspirin was added after completion of thrombus formation, no significant effect on thrombolysis was noted. Prostaglandin E1 (1-100 mumol/l) improved the lysis with urokinase of the combined platelet and fibrin thrombi. This effect was maximal at 20 mumol/l prostaglandin E1. When pure fibrin thrombi were produced in platelet-free plasma, prostaglandin E1 was without effect on lysis. Thus, in vitro lysis with urokinase of combined platelet and fibrin thrombi was enhanced by the addition of platelet-deaggregating prostaglandin E1 and by pretreatment with aspirin.\r"

The endocardial endothelium can modulate the mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium and mediate responses to certain physiopharmacologic agents. We studied the effects of aggregating platelets on the contractile performance of isolated cardiac muscle. The role of the endocardium was investigated by selectively damaging it by very brief (1 second) exposure to 1% Triton X-100 in some muscle preparations before experiments. Cat papillary muscles (n = 54) were attached to an electromagnetic length-tension transducer in organ baths containing Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C), and stimulated electrically at 0.2 Hz. Homologous washed platelets (final concentration 3 x 10(11)/l) aggregated spontaneously on addition to baths. Mechanical performance increased significantly more in muscles with damaged endocardium than in intact muscles (p less than 0.05); total peak isometric twitch tension increased by 31.8 +/- 7.8% (with damaged endocardium) and 11.8 +/- 2.6% (with intact endocardium), and peak isotonic twitch shortening increased by 36.7 +/- 7.8% (with damaged endocardium) and 9.6 +/- 2.0% (with intact endocardium). Increases in maximum velocity of unloaded shortening were similar in both muscle groups. Time to half isometric twitch tension decline decreased in intact muscles (3.6 +/- 1.0%) but increased in Triton-treated muscles (2.5 +/- 1.3%, p = 0.003 for difference between groups). The inotropic response to platelets in muscles with intact endocardium was unaltered by pretreatment of muscles with indomethacin (10 microM) or by stimulation of platelet aggregation with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of concentrations of vasopressin encountered in pathophysiologic states on the collateral circulation in vivo. We studied eight open-chest anesthetized dogs with mature coronary collateral vessels 3-6 months after placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery. The left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused at constant pressure, and peripheral coronary pressure was monitored continuously throughout each experiment. At baseline and during intracoronary infusion of vasopressin, which resulted in concentrations ranging from 8 +/- 3 to 1,340 +/- 327 microM/ml, we measured regional myocardial perfusion with radiolabeled microspheres. At baseline, regional myocardial perfusion to the collateral-dependent myocardium and to the normally perfused myocardium was similar; however, during vasopressin infusion, collateral-dependent zone flow decreased by 49 +/- 14% whereas normal zone flow decreased by only 9 +/- 9% (p less than 0.0005, normal zone perfusion vs. collateral perfusion). Vasopressin increased transcollateral resistance by 242 +/- 95% above baseline but produced a more modest increase in normal zone resistance (15 +/- 10%). The subendocardial to subepicardial perfusion ratio increased by 28 +/- 12% in the normal zone in response to vasopressin but decreased by 18 +/- 11% in the collateral-dependent zone. These data show that mature coronary collateral vessels are responsive to the vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin at concentrations encountered in various pathophysiologic states.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pure alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine, and mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, such as epinephrine, raise perfusion pressure for heart and brain during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, with the high doses used during CPR, these drugs may directly affect vascular smooth muscle and metabolism in brain and heart. We determined whether at equivalent perfusion pressure, continuous infusion of phenylephrine (20 micrograms/kg/min) or epinephrine (4 micrograms/kg/min) leads to equal organ blood flow, cerebral O2 uptake, and cerebral electrophysiologic function. During 20 minutes of CPR initiated immediately upon ventricular fibrillation in anesthetized dogs, left ventricular blood flow was similar with epinephrine (45 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g) or phenylephrine (47 +/- 8 ml/min/100 g) infusion. The ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial blood flow fell equivalently during CPR with either epinephrine (1.23 +/- 0.06 to 0.70 +/- 0.05) or phenylephrine (1.32 +/- 0.07 to 0.77 +/- 0.05) administration. At similar levels of cerebral perfusion pressure (44 +/- 3 mm Hg), similar levels of cerebral blood flow were measured in both groups (27 +/- 3 ml/min/100 g). Cerebral O2 uptake was maintained at prearrest levels in both groups. Somatosensory-evoked potential amplitude was modestly reduced during CPR, but it promptly recovered after defibrillation. During CPR and at 2 hours after resuscitation, there were no differences between drug groups in the level of regional cerebral or coronary blood flow, cerebral O2 uptake, or evoked potentials. Therefore, with minimal delay in the onset of CPR and with equipotent pressor doses of phenylephrine and epinephrine, we found no evidence that one agent provides superior coronary or cerebral blood flow or that epinephrine by virtue of its beta-adrenergic properties adversely stimulates cerebral metabolism at a critical time that would impair brain electrophysiologic function. Moreover, epinephrine did not preferentially impair subendocardial blood flow as might be expected if it enhanced the strength of fibrillatory contractions.\r"

  ".W": "The noninvasive Doppler assessment of regurgitant volume from jet size is limited by the fundamental inequality of jet volume and regurgitant volume and by the dependence of jet dimensions on driving pressure and instrument settings for a given flow volume. Therefore, this study addresses the hypothesis that an equation could be derived from basic physical principles to quantify regurgitant volume with velocities that can be directly measured by Doppler echocardiography. The principle of conservation of momentum for free turbulent jets resembling many cardiac lesions yields an equation for regurgitant volume as a function of maximum jet velocity, a distal centerline velocity, and the intervening distance. This theory was tested throughout a range of physiologic flow rates and pressures (orifice velocities) in steady flow for 0.08-0.40 cm2 circular orifices and a noncircular orifice and in physiologic pulsatile flow for 0.08 and 0.20 cm2 circular orifices. Plots of centerline velocities versus axial distance coincided with those expected for such jets. Calculated and actual volumetric flows agreed well by linear regression in the turbulent jet: for steady flow rates, y = 0.98x + 0.09 (r = 0.99, SEE = 0.14 l/min), with similar correlations for circular and noncircular orifices; for pulsatile flow, y = 1.02x + 0.03 for peak flow rate (r = 0.98, SEE = 0.18 l/min) and y = 1.02x + 0.58 for total regurgitant volume (r = 0.95, SEE = 0.81 ml). There was no significant effect of orifice size or location of velocity measurement within the turbulent jet. Therefore, for free jets resembling many clinical lesions, regurgitant flow rate and volume can be calculated noninvasively from Doppler velocities without planimetry of jet area. Because the required information is intrinsic to the jet, this method should apply regardless of associated valvular lesions. It should also apply to orifices of variable shape because turbulent eddies obliterate the details of flow at the orifice. The special case of jets impinging on walls must be considered separately for both this technique and flow mapping.\r"

Following univariate regression analysis of 3,500 consecutive operations, 14 risk factors were chosen that met these conditions. A few factors were excluded because they were insufficiently objective or not always available. An additive model was constructed, using the factors chosen, to calculate the probability of mortality within 30 days. The method was then tested prospectively in 1,332 open-heart procedures at the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Patients were categorized in five groups of increasing risk: good (0-4%), fair (5-9%), poor (10-14%), high (15-19%), and extremely high (greater than or equal to 20%). The correlation coefficient of anticipated and observed operative mortality, using the additive model, was 0.99. The operative mortality also correlated closely with complication rates and length of hospital stay. The additive model was compared with a second model based on logistic multiple regression; the resulting correlation coefficient was 0.85. The method was also tested at two other hospitals; although their sample sizes were smaller, the outcomes in each risk group were comparable with those at this institution. The collection of data proved to be acceptably simple for all three centers. This study demonstrates that it is possible to design a simple method of risk stratification of open-heart surgery patients that makes it feasible to analyze operative results by risk groups and to compare results in similar groups between institutions. Wider application of the system is recommended.\r"

Thirty-five percent of the patients were treated with radical surgery, 40% with curative-dosage radiotherapy and 22% with combined therapy. One-year survival with No Evidence of Disease (NED) was 48%. Almost all recurrences were within the first year following completion of the initial treatment. Treatment results were especially ineffective in large local tumour cases (T3 and T4) and in instances with extensive regional lymph node metastases (N2 and N3). The observed 5-year survival ('crude survival') was 44%. All parameters for the course of disease following diagnosis and treatment were significantly correlated to disease stage.\r"

Pure-tone audiometry, including bone and air-conduction thresholds, was recorded using standard procedures. BERA was used to construct a latency-intensity function and from this the conductive hearing loss could be estimated. For all frequencies except for 2000 Hz a good correlation was found between the conductive loss in the pure-tone audiogram and the conductive loss as estimated by BERA. The moderate correlation for 2000 Hz is due to a 'Carhart'-notch-like phenomenon in the pure-tone audiogram.\r"

In 6 ears out of 81 second stages, residual cholesteatoma was found in the mesotympanum. No residual cholesteatoma was subsequently observed behind the flap but only 4 ears were checked behind the flap at the second stage. An air-bone gap within 20 dB was achieved in 85% of ears if the stapes was intact and surgery was performed in one stage, and in 55% of ears of the stapes was intact and surgery performed in 2 stages. If the crura were missing, an air-bone gap within 20 dB was achieved in 57% of ears in 2 stages.\r"

Following surgery, changes in symptoms of nasal obstruction as recorded by questionnaire were largely consistent with changes in mucociliary function and to a lesser extent with rhinomanometry.

Should blood then be required, this procedure enables un-crossmatched ABO-Rh(D) group specific blood to be released in an emergency with a high degree of safety. The routine cross-matching of blood can be supported for the remainder of the major head and neck operations, and guidelines as to the number of units that should be cross-matched are suggested. Implementation of these policies will reduce the number of units of blood unecessarily cross-matched, decrease the amount of time-expired blood, and lead to increased efficiency of blood utilization.\r"

Furthermore, the reliability of sonotubometry testing as a predictor of glue ear was assessed and compared with the current methods of pre-operative assessment (pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and otoscopy). Sonotubometry compares well, giving a correct prediction rate of 85%. In addition it has been shown that, unlike the other tests, sonotubometry testing was possible on all children studied.\r"

Determination of the oral and nasal acoustic ratio or 'Nasalance' is quick, painless, and non-invasive. There was good agreement and reproducibility within normal subjects when test phrases were used. Words such as 'bananas' which contain nasal consonants showed large reductions in the Nasalance score when the nostrils were occluded and are of use in clinical assessment. This method may be of use in refining the selection of children for adenoidectomy.\r"

The axillary nerve arises immediately posterior to the coracoid process and conjoint tendon. It crosses the inferolateral border of the subscapularis 3 to 5 mm medial to its musculotendinous junction, and it lies in intimate contact with the inferior capsule as it passes through the quadrilateral space. The nerve should be visualized prior to transecting the subscapularis tendon. During detachment of the inferior capsule from the humeral neck, the humerus should be gradually externally rotated, and the nerve should be gently retracted with a small flat instrument. Sutures reattaching the flap should be carefully placed to avoid injuring the nerve. The tendinous insertion of the teres minor is preserved from a posterior approach. The nerve can be visualized and protected during capsular detachment.\r"

Average age at time of initial surgery was 40 years (range, 20-64 years), and the follow-up period averaged 5.5 years (range, three to nine years). Thirty-four patients were found to have symptoms and signs that corresponded to a recognized clinical diagnosis and were thought to be sufficient to be a major cause of their pain. Twenty-three had a diagnosis other than continuing impingement. Success of a second surgical procedure was significantly greater in nonworker's compensation (WC) patients than in WC patients. Repeat acromioplasties in WC patients have poor results and are not recommended. Seventeen patients had no clear cause for their continuing shoulder tendinitis; however, time and supportive therapy allowed five patients to improve over an average 18-month period. In all categories, WC patients fared poorly, so prognosis must be guarded in this group. Non-WC patients may be helped with repeat surgery following an appropriate diagnosis for the cause of failure.\r"

Measurements were obtained from 25 anatomic specimen shoulders. The glenoid articular surface and labrum combine to create a socket that is approximately 9 mm deep in the superoinferior (SI) direction and 5 mm deep in the anteroposterior (AP) direction. The circular, pliable, fibrous labrum contributes approximately 50% of the total depth of the socket. Detachment of the labrum anteriorly, as in a Bankart lesion, may reduce the depth of the socket in the AP direction from approximately 5.0 to 2.4 mm. These anatomic observations provide some evidence that the socket may be an important factor in shoulder stability. Further in vivo kinematic studies of shoulders will be needed to better define the stabilizing role of the glenoid-labral socket.\r"

Although the difference in energy to failure in torsion was not statistically significant between the two methods, both fell considerably short of control values. The lag preparation was 9% as strong as intact controls, and the plate preparation was 21% as strong as intact controls. Long spiral fractures without comminution are amenable to triple lag-screw osteosynthesis with some loss of rigidity and strength when compared to single-plate fixation. This decrease in rigidity and strength may be outweighed by the avoidance of the stress protection phenomenon noted under rigid plates.\r"

Absence of the classic roentgenographic appearance led to the delay in these cases. The difficulty in diagnosing the lesion on routine roentgenograms derives from the specific reaction to the lesion by cancellous bone as compared to cortical bone. Bone scans proved to be sensitive at locating a focal area of intense uptake but lacked the specificity to make the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) was quite specific at making the diagnosis and localizing the lesion for biopsy. How to differentiate between osteoid osteoma and osteomyelitis by CT is described. When osteoid osteoma is suspected in nondiaphyseal locations, CT is likely to aid in the diagnosis and localization of the lesion for biopsy.\r"

To investigate the action of BMP on the growth of host bed-derived bone in experimental spinal fusions, posterior intervertebral spinal fusions of the lower thoracic spine were performed in 13 mature mongrel dogs. Four different fusion methods were used at single intervertebral levels within each dog. Three levels in each dog were used as controls for the BMP level. The spinal columns were examined by radiohistomorphometric methods at three weeks, six weeks, and 12 weeks and showed the BMP level to have two to three times more new bone than control levels. At the BMP level, an increase in the amount of new bone was observed in the interval from three to 12 weeks, in contrast to a decrease seen at the control levels. Fusion was present in five of seven of the BMP levels compared with zero of seven, one of seven, and two of seven in the control levels. The BMP level exhibited an increased number and volume of areas of de novo cartilage and woven bone formation at all time intervals compared to all control levels. The polylactic acid polymer carrier was not resorbed and partially retained in the fusion site. The preliminary observations suggest that BMP may serve as a useful adjunct in spinal fusions, but research is required to find a rapidly degradable delivery system. The objective of BMP research is to augment the host bed capacity for bone generation and regeneration and to spare children and adults the pain and complications involved in removing excessive volumes of iliac crest bone grafts.\r"

Preoperatively, the mechanical axis of alignment showed varus deformity with an average of 9.6 degrees, while the final follow-up evaluation demonstrated valgus alignment with an average of 4.7 degrees. According to the criteria of Insall et al. the knee scores improved from 63.3 preoperatively to 88.8 postoperatively. The results were excellent or good in 84.8% of 118 knees followed an average of 27 months (range, 12-84 months). A significant relationship existed between the success of the correction of the mechanical axis and the knee's functional result. Also, the severity of the preoperative coronal angular deformity of the knee joint had a negative relationship with the final knee function. There were 39 (33.1%) complications, including 13 recurrences of varus deformity, 13 pin-tract infections, five peroneal nerve palsies, and two paralyses of the extensor hallucis longus. Preoperative arthroscopic grading according to the criteria of Fujisawa et al. and the additional point-counting method did not adequately predict the knee's functional outcome, but postoperative arthroscopic grading was of some prognostic value.\r"

The relationship between microanatomic and histologic levels of organization are herein examined in two groups of osteoporotic subjects, one with idiopathic and the other with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. Using tissue from the iliac crest, total trabecular surface and trabecular width and number were measured, together with bone volume and static and dynamic indices of formation (osteoid surface, seam width, mean wall thickness, lamellar thickness, calcification fronts, and mineralization rate) and resorption (total resorption cavities and osteoclast incidence). The results suggest that while a similar loss of trabecular bone volume is common to both groups, there is a marked distinction in the distribution of the remaining bony tissue and indices of remodeling. A decline in trabecular number accompanied by a relative increase in resorption characterized both sexes with primary osteoporosis, whereas a decline in trabecular width associated with depressed formation was the predominant feature in the secondary disease. Thus trabecular attenuation is principally the manifestation of depressed formation, while trabecular discontinuity is primarily the manifestation of bone resorption.\r"

A classification scheme is proposed to characterize the areas and types of injury. Type I open joint injuries are single penetrations without extensive soft-tissue damage, permitting uncomplicated joint and wound closure. Type II injuries are single or multiple penetrations with extensive soft-tissue disruptions (flaps, avulsions, degloving), often requiring secondary operations to attain closure. Type III injuries are open periarticular fractures with extension through the adjacent intraarticular surface. Type IV injuries are open dislocations or those with associated nerve or vascular injury requiring repair. The extent of intraarticular injury further subdivides Types I, II, and III. The prognosis for functional impairment correlates with the severity of injury. The cornerstones for successful management are debridement, antibiotic therapy, properly timed and performed joint closure, and aggressive treatment of the associated bony injury.\r"

Employees in the clinics, laboratories, emergency room, and operating room had an increased prevalence of hepatitis B markers compared to those in other work locations (8 vs. 2%, p less than 0.05). Traditional risk factors for infection were not predictive of seropositivity. Although the risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection from employment in a children's hospital is low, this study does identify work-related risk factors. Possible reasons for this association are discussed.\r"

Adults who coach the children largely determine what the children's sports experience will be. Coaches' perceptions of what is important for the young children they instruct have not yet been carefully investigated. This study was designed, therefore, to determine coaches' goals for young children. Data were gathered by use of an attitude questionnaire administered to 29 coaches of a recreational basketball program of children ranging in age from 6 to 10 years old. Of the 12 goals, feeling part of a team, learning to do my best, and having fun and excitement were most highly rated as extremely important, while becoming popular was lowest rated as not important. Results revealed that coaches in general are able to clearly define their goals and priorities, and these goals seem developmentally appropriate for the children. However, coaches make little differentiation in goals based on age.\r"

  ".W": "We can draw several conclusions from an analysis of our series: 1. Although prematurity remains to be an important factor in the survival of infants with major surgical or medical disease, the more important risk factor in esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula concerns: a. Severity of associated anomalies that are uncorrectable and fatal b. Associated complication from the disease or surgery (especially in infants less than 1500 gm). Complications such as tracheal perforation and gastric perforation are not tolerated well and can be fatal (the case in two of our patients). 2. Premature infants weighing even less than 1500 gm tolerate a major thoracotomy well with correction of an esophageal anomaly. In this series, the smallest weighed 1220 gm. This infant had an uneventful recovery with a good outcome. 3. Simultaneous correction of associated anomalies also is well tolerated by these patients. Judgment, however, should be exercised as to the extent and length of operative procedures performed. 4. Staged reconstruction is still an excellent alternative when one is dealing with a premature infant with concomitant surgical procedures, although lengthening operations with primary anastomosis for the most part have replaced the need for staging esophageal reconstruction. 5. Radiographs indicating a high upper pouch lesion also require bronchoscopic identification of the fistula prior to operative intervention to provide a guide to the proper surgical approach to the lesion. 6. Acute anastomotic leaks should be treated aggressively by antibiotics and immediate thoracotomy, with cervical esophagostomy, closure of the distal esophagus, drainage of the mediastinum, and gastrostomy placement. immediate intervention will result in better survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our experience in the management of 138 infants with various causes of intestinal obstruction has provided us with important principles of diagnosis and treatments that we adhere to in the course of our practice. 1. The overall mortality of neonates suffering from intestinal obstruction should be fewer than 5 per cent. The high survival rate is accounted for by improved care these patients receive in specialized units. 2. Prematurity did not appear to play a significant factor in the outcome of these infants with intestinal obstruction. Our experience shows that premature infants tolerate operative procedures well, even in those instances in which an associated surgically correctable lesion is simultaneously repaired. 3. The major risk factor in any neonate with intestinal obstruction is the delay in diagnosis and operative intervention, especially in infants diagnosed to have midgut volvulus. The additional second risk factor is the association of chromosome abnormality. 4. Traditional diagnostic studies such as plain films of the abdomen supplemented by either an upper GI or lower GI contrast study for specific indications have been very effective in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of intestinal bowel obstruction. 5. Hirschsprung's disease can be diagnosed in the neonatal period if the index of suspicion for this is high. 6. Special surgical techniques as described should be used whenever indicated to minimize morbidity. 7. The traditional Wangensteen-Rice evaluation of a patient with imperforate anus is accurate, and specialized studies should be deferred for the postoperative period. Collaborative care provided by the neonatologist, pediatric anesthesiologist, and pediatric surgeon for these patients is the key to a favorable outcome.\r"

Maturational variables such as postnatal age, postconceptional age, gestational age, duration of treatment, and body weight at the time of the study were analyzed for their influence on theophylline kinetics during the first 6 months of life. The strongest statistical correlations were found between the logarithm of theophylline half-life (t1/2) and the postnatal age (r = 0.98; p less than 0.001) and the postconceptional age (r = 0.96; p less than 0.001). Step-wise multiple regression analysis revealed postnatal age as the most powerful predictor for theophylline t1/2 in the neonatal period (partial correlation coefficients were 0.78 for postnatal age, 0.19 for postconceptional age, and 0.10 for gestational age). Gestational age, duration of treatment, and weight did not correlate significantly with any pharmacokinetic parameters. We propose that theophylline metabolizing function of the liver increases in a logarithmic fashion during the first 6 months of life.\r"

To investigate age-related changes in receptor regulation in human beings, young (24 to 35 years of age) and elderly (62 to 78 years of age) healthy volunteers were treated with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent timolol maleate (10 mg b.i.d.) for 8 days. Baseline densities of beta 2-adrenergic receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membranes and heart rates were the same in the two age groups. However, systolic blood pressures were higher in the elderly subjects. Administration of timolol produced similar plasma levels in the two groups. In response to timolol, the density of PMNL beta-adrenergic receptors increased at a similar rate and to the same extent (threefold) in both age groups. Likewise, hemodynamic changes were not related to age. These results suggest that up-regulation of peripheral beta 2-adrenergic receptors in human beings is not impaired with aging.\r"

The other 10 patients received 500 mg of disulfiram daily. Two single-dose studies of theophylline kinetics were performed--one as a baseline control and the other after 1 week of treatment with disulfiram. With disulfiram pretreatment, the plasma clearance of theophylline was decreased from 105.7 +/- 10.2 (mean +/- SEM) to 83.1 +/- 8.1 ml/kg per hour (p less than 0.001) in the 250 mg group and from 94.3 +/- 13.3 to 65.4 +/- 10.7 ml/mg per hour (p less than 0.001) in the 500 mg group. The elimination half-life was prolonged significantly in both groups. The percent reduction in theophylline clearance was greater in the 500 mg group (32.5 +/- 3.1; range, 21.6 to 49.6) than it was in the 250 mg group (21.2 +/- 1.7; range, 14.6 to 29.6; p less than 0.01). Disulfiram decreased the formation of all theophylline metabolites in smokers in both treatment groups. In each group, the hydroxylation pathway was affected more than the demethylation pathway. These data indicate that at therapeutic doses disulfiram exerts a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on theophylline metabolism. Depending on the dose of disulfiram, a dose reduction of theophylline by as much as 50% may be necessary to minimize the risk of toxicity.\r"

In vitro inhibition does not involve neutrophil activation-densensitization or neutrophil cytotoxicity and is reversible to a great extent by drug washout. In the examination of possible free-radical scavenging action of these drugs, it was demonstrated that both drugs inhibit superoxide anion production by xanthine oxidase but not by chelated iron. This raises the possibility that these agents may bear structural similarities to oxypyrazolopyrimidines such as allopurinol.\r"

There was no change in the phenotypic trait values of the two drugs when they were coadministered. Mephenytoin and debrisoquin then were coadministered to 253 healthy Swedish subjects, before bedtime, and urine samples were collected at periods of 0 to 8, 8 to 24, and 24 to 32 hours after drug administration. In the first sample, seven of the 253 subjects (2.8%, 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 4.8%) had an S/R ratio of greater than 0.8; this indicated that they were poor hydroxylators of S-mephenytoin. In the two consecutive samples, the S/R ratios of mephenytoin did not change in these seven persons, whereas it decreased to less than 0.2 in the third sample in the extensive hydroxylators. As was reported before, there was no relationship between the mephenytoin S/R ratio and the debrisoquin metabolic ratio (rs = 0.01). Coadministration of debrisoquin and mephenytoin before bedtime and urine collection during two consecutive nights allow for an accurate determination of both phenotypes in the population.\r"

The plasma concentrations of S-(+)-carprofen were higher than those of R-(-)-carprofen at most of the sampling points. Probenecid reduced apparent total and renal clearances for both enantiomers. It also reduced the clearances of the carprofen enantiomers to their glucuronides and the renal clearances of the glucuronides. The differences caused by probenecid were significant, but few stereoselective effects were observed.\r"

All patients exhibited smooth log plasma free concentration-time profiles. In contrast, marked increases in plasma total (approximate 50% increase) and blood (approximate 40% increase) diazepam concentrations occurred at delivery. The plasma total and blood concentration fluctuations were associated with reciprocal variations in diazepam percent free in plasma. For each patient there was a substantial increase in plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration during the surgical period. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.02) between diazepam percent free and plasma NEFA concentration on the day of delivery, suggesting that the fluctuations in percent free, and hence plasma total and blood diazepam concentrations, were mediated in part by variations in plasma NEFA concentration. Disposition parameters were calculated for four of the patients; the mean free plasma clearance of diazepam was 42.5 ml/min/kg, similar to the mean value reported previously for nonpregnant women of comparable age. For each mother-infant pair at delivery the ratio of total plasma diazepam concentration in umbilical vein plasma to that in maternal vein plasma was considerably greater than unity (mean +/- SD = 1.73 +/- 0.47), whereas the corresponding ratio for free plasma diazepam concentration was near unity (0.92 +/- 0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subject \"liking\" for buprenorphine was reported by both observers and subjects. The relative potency of sublingually to subcutaneously administered buprenorphine was calculated for both physiologic and behavioral parameters and found to be approximately two thirds.

The unaltered DMSA was 12% of the total DMSA found in the urine. The altered form(s) of DMSA was 88% of the total urinary DMSA. The altered DMSA can be converted to unaltered DMSA by electrolytic reduction, which indicates that the altered forms of DMSA are disulfides. The excretion of altered DMSA reached a peak between 2 and 4 hours after DMSA administration. There were small but statistically significant increases in the excretion of zinc, copper, and lead after DMSA administration.

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic disposition of cefotaxime, desacetyl cefotaxime, and mezlocillin after the administration of each drug singly and in combination was examined in eight healthy volunteers and in five anuric patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the presence of ESRD, the total body clearance of cefotaxime decreased from 256.7 +/- 41.5 to 65.4 +/- 42.0 ml/min, and its elimination half-life (t1/2) increased from 1.1 to 3.6 hours as compared with healthy volunteers. Concomitant administration of mezlocillin in healthy volunteers decreased the total body clearance of cefotaxime by 42% and increased its steady-state volume of distribution. This reduction in clearance was reflected by a decrease in both renal and nonrenal clearances. In the presence of ESRD, coadministration of mezlocillin increased the t1/2 of cefotaxime to 5.8 hours. Desacetyl cefotaxime accumulated in ESRD with a prolongation of its elimination t1/2 to 18.7 hours from 1.7 hours in healthy volunteers. Desacetyl cefotaxime peak plasma concentrations occurred later with the combination regimen in the presence of ESRD. The clearance of mezlocillin was reduced and t1/2 prolonged in ESRD from 194.6 +/- 31.9 to 76.4 +/- 38.8 ml/min and 1.4 to 2.3 hours, respectively. Concomitant administration of cefotaxime did not alter the pharmacokinetics of mezlocillin. These data suggest that in the presence of normal renal function, lower doses of cefotaxime may be adequate to maintain similar cefotaxime plasma concentrations when mezlocillin is coadministered compared to when cefotaxime is given alone. Additional pharmacodynamic and clinical studies with this combination are warranted to further elucidate the clinical impact of this pharmacokinetic interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Propafenone, a class IC antiarrhythmic agent, is metabolized into two active metabolites: 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we examined trough plasma concentrations of propafenone and its two metabolites in 169 subjects. Patients were randomized to one of five parallel treatment groups: placebo and 337.5, 450, 675, or 900 mg/day propafenone with 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitorings, 12-lead ECGs, and plasma samples obtained at frequent intervals. Nonlinear kinetics were noted for propafenone and NDPP but not for 5-OHP. The ratio of NDPP to propafenone was about 10% at all doses, but the ratio of 5-OHP to propafenone decreased from 33% at 337.5 mg/day to 18% at 900 mg/day. Propafenone suppression of ventricular ectopy was dependent on concentration, with pairs and VT beats selectively suppressed at lower concentrations than VPBs. The PR interval and QRS duration increased significantly at propafenone concentrations above 100 ng/ml, while minimal heart rate slowing was noted at concentrations above 1,000 ng/ml.\r"

A wide range of free concentrations may be produced at a given total concentration. The present study assessed whether intracardiac electrophysiologic responses to disopyramide related better to free or to total concentration. Intravenous infusions of disopyramide were evaluated in 17 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. The first maintenance infusion produced total serum concentrations of 11.7 +/- 2 mumols/L, and no significant increase occurred at higher-dose infusions. However, free concentrations during the first and second maintenance infusions were significantly different at 5.3 +/- 1 mumols/L and 6.8 +/- 1 mumols/L, respectively. Free fraction also increased significantly, from 45% +/- 8% to 50% +/- 7%. Overall change in QTc interval and ventricular tachycardia cycle length correlated with free concentration but not with total concentration. This study showed that some intracardiac measurements correlate with free concentration but that none correlate with total concentration.\r"

Twenty-six children and adolescents (aged 3 to 21 years) were studied three times, once with each substrate given alone and once with the two substrates given together. Urine was collected for 4 hours, and the molar urinary metabolic ratios for dextromethorphan:dextrorphan and for two caffeine metabolites (AFMU:1X) were determined by HPLC ultraviolet assays. The urinary metabolic ratios for both substrates were not significantly different when the substrates were given alone compared with when they were given together. There also was no difference in either the oxidation or acetylation phenotype assignments when the two substrates were given alone and when they were given together. No adverse effects were observed. We conclude that dextromethorphan and caffeine can be given together to simultaneously determine oxidation and acetylation phenotypes and can thereby provide an innocuous, noninvasive method for the assessment of polymorphic drug metabolism in various pediatric populations.\r"

Myocardial levels of alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were measured by dot hybridization to specific oligonucleotide probes; myocardial actin mRNA was measured in parallel by hybridization to a complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Hepatic levels of Spot 14 and thyroxine-binding prealbumin mRNA were similarly determined by dot hybridization to radiolabelled cDNAs. 3. Amiodarone treatment of the rat resulted in specific increases in both alpha- and beta-MHC mRNAs in the myocardium, as well as hepatic Spot 14 mRNA, changes reversed by T3 administration. 4. Hypothyroidism resulted in a reduction in myocardial alpha-MHC and hepatic Spot 14 mRNAs, in contrast to amiodarone, whilst hypothyroidism and amiodarone both exerted stimulatory influences on beta-MHC mRNA. Treatment of hypothyroid rats with amiodarone had no significant effect on beta-MHC or Spot 14 mRNAs, but a further reduction in alpha-MHC mRNA, compared with the untreated hypothyroid state, was evident. 5. The demonstrated influence of amiodarone on both alpha- and beta-MHC mRNAs and interactions between amiodarone and thyroid status in regulating MHC gene expression may be relevant to its therapeutic effect in man.\r"

In the large mesenteric arteries, the smooth muscle cell labelling indices were similar between the SHR and WKY at all age groups, except at 1 week of age when the smooth muscle labelling index was higher in the SHR. 4. In the superior mesenteric arteries, labelling indices were similar between the rat strains at all age groups. 5. We conclude that, in the SHR, a rapid proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the large mesenteric arteries occurred during the first week of life. This resulted in a higher number of smooth muscle cell layers in the media of muscular arteries. 6. The increased proliferation may play a role in the subsequent development of hypertension in the SHR.\r"

The regional effects of putative mediators involved in asthma on airway microvascular permeability have been studied. 2. The effects of histamine, leukotriene (LT) D4 and platelet-activating factor (PAF) on microvascular permeability in the nasal mucosa, larynx, trachea, main bronchi and intrapulmonary airways of the guinea pig were assessed by measuring the extravasation of intravenously administered Evans Blue dye. 3. PAF and LTD4 caused increased microvascular leakage throughout the respiratory tract, although their effects were maximal in different regions. Histamine had no significant effect on intrapulmonary airways. PAF was more potent than LTD4 and histamine at all airway levels. For example, in the trachea the doses required to cause leakage of 50% of maximal (ED50) were 10.4 nmol/kg, 138 nmol/kg and 11.2 mumol/kg, respectively, for PAF, LTD4 and histamine. 4. The effect of the three mediators was maximal 5 min after intravenous administration. Histamine, but neither LTD4 nor PAF, still caused significant leakage 30 min after administration. 5. The increased microvascular leakage induced by the mediators was inhibited by their respective specific receptor antagonists, suggesting that the effect was mediated via specific receptors. 6. Histamine, LTD4 and PAF have varying potencies in increasing microvascular permeability in the guinea-pig respiratory tract, exert their maximal effect in different regions and have varying durations of action.\r"

The oscillation method for measuring total respiratory resistance (Rrs) is a simple method of assessing airway dimensions which can be applied in epidemiological surveys and potentially might be useful for detecting mild airway disease in smokers. However, it is not known whether abnormalities in Rrs are only present when there are also abnormalities in simple spirometric tests. 2. We have compared values of Rrs and its frequency-dependence (fR) using the oscillation technique applied over the frequency range 6-26 Hz in 42 healthy, non-asthmatic men who were never-smokers (aged 26-61 years) and in 41 male cigarette smokers (aged 32-64 years). The results were compared with those for spirometry and the single-breath N2 test which are the most commonly used techniques in epidemiological surveys for detecting the effects of smoking on the lungs. 3. There was a strong trend for Rrs (especially at lower oscillation frequency) and fR to increase with increasing age in smokers. Increases in Rrs and fR were usually present when forced expiratory volume in 1 s was less than 80% of predicted and the forced expiratory volume in 1 s/vital capacity ratio was less than 65%, but abnormal fR was present in some smokers whose spirometry was within conventional normal limits. 4. Abnormalities in Rrs and fR were weakly associated with abnormality of the single-breath N2 manoeuvre.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This compound is about 50% as active as tri-iodothyronine (T3) in liver nuclear receptor binding in vivo but only 1% as active in vitro and has nearly 200 times more enzyme-inducing activity in liver than in heart. Our aim was to examine the interaction of SKF L-94901 with [125I]T3 binding to the intact nuclei in whole cells, isolated nuclei and nuclear extracts of human HeLa cells and to investigate the binding of this compound to human serum. 2. Relative to thyroxine (T4), the affinity of this compound for T4-binding globulin was 0.0035%, for transthyretin 1.66% and for albumin 1.26%. Low affinity for serum proteins, with a relatively high circulating free fraction, could explain why SKF L-94901 is more potent in vivo than in vitro. 3. Human HeLa cell nuclei, isolated after whole-cell incubations, bound [125I]T3 with high affinity (Kd = 78 +/- 8 pmol/l, mean +/- SEM), which was displaceable by T3 analogues in the order Triac [( 4-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenoxy)-3,5-di-iodophenyl]acetic acid) greater than T3 greater than T4 much greater than reverse T3. Similar high-affinity (Kd = 58 +/- 6 pmol/l, mean +/- SEM) and identical specificity was observed in high-salt (0.4 mol/l KCl) nuclear extracts. In nuclei of whole cells incubated with [125I]T3 and SKF L-94901, the analogue was 0.8% as potent as T3, whereas in experiments with nuclear extract, the analogue was 7.7% as potent as T3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is a large depot in many subjects, and seems well suited to such studies as it is completely separated from the venous drainage of the underlying muscle by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. 2. Eight normal subjects were studied after an overnight fast, and for 120 min after ingestion of 75 g of glucose. Concentrations of substrates in the abdominal wall drainage were compared with those in arterialized blood and in forearm muscle drainage. 3. Non-esterified fatty acid and glycerol concentrations in the abdominal wall drainage were high (three to four times the arterial level) after overnight fast. After glucose ingestion, arterial and abdominal venous levels fell and the arteriovenous differences narrowed. The forearm showed uptake of non-esterified fatty acids when fasting but not after glucose ingestion, with no significant arteriovenous difference for glycerol at any time. 4. The abdominal wall tissues showed a small arteriovenous difference for glucose uptake during fasting, which increased after glucose ingestion. Although lactate was produced throughout, its molar ratio to glucose uptake was less than that reported for other superficial sites, suggesting only a minor contribution of skin metabolism. Forearm muscle showed a larger and more prolonged increase in arteriovenous difference for glucose uptake after the glucose load, but no consistent release or uptake of lactate. 5. We conclude that the tissue studied by this technique is predominantly adipose. This technique may have wide application in studies of the metabolic basis for body weight regulation in man.\r"

Unusual test results were obtained. Assessment of the integrity of the total baroreflex arc by the Valsalva manoeuvre measuring only heart rate changes proved impossible, since the magnitude and time course of the heart rate response were normal notwithstanding the presence of a blood pressure response typical of sympathetic failure. 3. Sustained handgrip, cold pressor test and mental stress test all could induce a rise in blood pressure, despite the presence of sympathetic vasomotor lesions, but only when accompanied by a rise in heart rate. Efferent parasympathetic blockade by atropine, resulting in an increase in heart rate, was also accompanied by a substantial rise in blood pressure. These findings seem to result from a heart rate rise dependent increase in cardiac output unopposed by reflex vasodilatation. 4. In these patients the only baroreflex way to control blood pressure is by varying heart rate. This condition can be evaluated only if blood pressure and heart rate are measured on a beat-by-beat basis.\r"

Chlorothiazide, which has marked carbonic anhydrase inhibiting activity, increased CLi by about 25%. The concomitant rise in uric acid clearance, maximum urine flow and bicarbonate excretion suggests that this drug suppressed proximal reabsorption through carbonic anhydrase inhibition, which would also explain the observed fall in glomerular filtration rate (increased glomerulotubular feedback activity). 3. Bendroflumethiazide, which lacks carbonic anhydrase inhibiting activity, did not affect CLi or any of the other above-mentioned variables. 4. It is concluded from the lack of an effect of bendroflumethiazide on CLi that Li+ is not reabsorbed in thiazide-sensitive segments of the human distal nephron. The rise in CLi after chlorothiazide is most likely due to suppressed Li+ reabsorption in the proximal tubules resulting from carbonic anhydrase inhibition. 5. The results of this study are compatible with the concept that CLi is an index of Na+ and water delivery from the proximal tubules in humans.\r"

Since we have previously reported marked suppression of Na+,K+ co-transport activity in erythrocytes from dialysis patients, we have now examined the effect of incubation with uraemic plasma on Na+ efflux through the Na+,K+ pump and the co-transport pathway in normal erythrocytes from both men and women. 2. The results show that Na+ efflux via the Na+,K+ pump is not different between men and women (3.14 +/- 0.14 vs 3.68 +/- 0.18 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells) and is not inhibited by incubation with uraemic plasma. 3. In contrast, co-transport-mediated Na+ efflux is lower in erythrocytes from normal women when compared with normal men (0.17 +/- 0.02 vs 0.25 +/- 0.05 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells, P less than 0.001). 4. Moreover, incubation with uraemic plasma causes stimulation of Na+ efflux through the co-transport pathway in erythrocytes of healthy women (0.17 +/- 0.02 vs 0.27 +/- 0.03 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells, P less than 0.005), but not in erythrocytes of healthy men (0.27 +/- 0.03 vs 0.25 +/- 0.05 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells). 5. Our data do not support the presence of either a Na+,K+ pump or a co-transport inhibitor in plasma from dialysed uraemic patients. Thus, the suppressed co-transport activity demonstrated in uraemic erythrocytes cannot be attributed to a circulating inhibitor, and may reflect an acquired membrane or transport defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our patients with allergic contact dermatitis have a higher incidence of positive patch tests to thimerosal than healthy subjects. The source of thimerosal sensitization in this group remains obscure, their history of exposure to this or to other mercury derivatives being comparable to that of the healthy population. Patients with allergic contact conjunctivitis and patients receiving immunotherapy for asthma or rhinitis present a significantly higher frequency of thimerosal sensitization than the other groups, indicating that ophthalmic solutions and thimerosal-preserved allergen extracts are an important source of thimerosal sensitization. The clinical relevance of thimerosal sensitization was definitively established only in patients with allergic contact conjunctivitis, even though patients receiving immunotherapy frequently presented local reactions at the site of allergen inoculation.\r"

In 1983 the film laboratory moved to new premises built to reduce exposure to hazardous chemicals. The study was carried out during 1983-1986 with repeated interviews and dermatological examinations of all employees (78 subjects) and patch testing those with a history of or with current chemical exposure or dermatitis (65 subjects). Of 54 chemically exposed subjects, 34 (63%) had a history of occupational dermatoses, and 12 (22%) were contact allergic to film chemicals. Current, probable occupational dermatoses were observed in 13 subjects--thereof 8 with hand eczema. No new case of occupational skin disease occurred during the investigation period, except for 1 case of ulceration from an acid splash. Petrolatum mixtures of the colour developing agents, Metol and hydroquinone were found most suitable for patch testing, since these chemicals are unstable and/or cause irritation in aqueous solutions. It is concluded that occurrence and severity of occupational dermatoses had been reduced by the technical measures taken to reduce chemical exposure.\r"

She and 2 dental nurses were allergic to aliphatic acrylates, including triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TREGDMA) and triethylene diglycol diacrylate (TREGDA). 4 patients were allergic to epoxy resin (ER) (containing mainly MW 340), possibly an impurity in some DCR. 2 patients were also allergic to methyl methacrylate (MMA): the dentist, had been exposed to MMA, but the nurse's exposure was uncertain. 1 patient was also allergic to rubber gloves, 2 to rubber chemicals but not their gloves, and 5 to disinfectants used. diagnosis was delayed as long as 13 years in spite of previous patch testing. Dermatologists need to use the patients' own DCR and the (meth)acrylate series for patch testing. No dental nurses could continue their occupation, but the dentist could occasionally handle DCR if wearing PVC gloves. Dental personnel need to know about the risks of DCR, and use no-touch techniques and protective gloves.\r"

By far the most cases were of irritant origin; in only 2.8% was a contact sensitization established. Exposure to water-based MWF caused irritant contact dermatitis more often than exposure to neat oils. No influence was found of the presence of atopy on the occurrence of dermatitis.

Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured plasma TNF levels in 43 septic patients suffering from a broad range of diseases. Measurements were taken on the day that sepsis was diagnosed. Eleven patients had detectable TNF plasma levels ranging from 10 to 100 pg/ml (TNF-positive group); in 32 patients circulating TNF could not be detected (TNF-negative group). The groups did not differ significantly as to age, underlying disease, percentage positive bacteremia and bacteriologic profile, sepsis score, and extent of MOF. Eight (73%) of 11 TNF-positive patients died from sepsis during ICU stay, vs. 11 (34%) of 32 TNF-negative patients (p less than .05). This study demonstrates that sepsis is accompanied by detectable circulating TNF in 25% of the cases, and for these patients mortality is twice that for comparable TNF-negative patients.\r"

APACHE scores at the time of initial laparotomy and at the time of open management, respectively, were: group 1, 19.8 and 16.6; group 2, 8.4 and 12.4; and group 3, 14.2 and 15.0. Twenty-seven patients had multiple system failure. Sixteen (53%) of the 30 patients survived, 73% in group 1, 60% in group 2, and 36% in group 3. Survival correlated well with age less than 50 yr and the absence of multiple organ failure. The technique was easily performed and many of the pitfalls previously reported were not observed. In patients requiring fascial prosthesis, the absorbable polyglycol acid (Dexon) mesh was found to be superior to the nonabsorbable polypropylene. We conclude that the open technique is feasible, effective, and worthy of consideration in patients with extensive wound necrosis and uncontrolled abdominal sepsis.\r"

All 70 (31%) patients with moderate and severe ARF also had some form of hemodynamic or pulmonary instability, and were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter. Of these 70 patients, 38 (54%) had PAH (mean BP 29 +/- 6 mm Hg); their mortality was 79% (30/38). The rest of the patients (n = 32) did not have PAH (mean BP was 15 +/- 3 mm Hg) and their mortality was 44% (14/32) (p less than .01). Thirty patients met all the criteria for adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and their mortality was 70% (21/30); all of them were included among the 38 PAH patients. ARDS patients who died had a significantly higher pulmonary vascular resistance and a significantly lower cardiac index than patients who survived (p less than .001).

In 168 (65%) of 258 patients, death was considered inevitable and CPR was not performed. Furthermore, 22 (9%) patients were allowed to die after withdrawal of intensive care support. These observations indicate that most deaths are expected in the ICU and that \"do-not-resuscitate\" orders can be reasonably given in the majority of fatal cases. Moreover, complete withdrawal of intensive care support should be considered as a reasonable option in hopeless patients. Since circulatory shock was identified as the most common potentially reversible problem, better prevention and management of acute circulatory failure are needed to improve survival.\r"

RBF increased sharply immediately after cessation of infusion, but soon declined and remained depressed throughout the rest of the 4-h experiment. The renal cortical PO2 remained depressed for approximately 2 h and then gradually increased toward the baseline level. Endotoxin infusion was followed by an increased renal PvO2 and a decreased renal arteriovenous oxygen difference. Renal oxygen consumption declined abruptly during endotoxin infusion, but increased toward the end of the experiment. These results suggest impaired tissue oxygenation and possibly increased oxygen shunting in the kidney during endotoxin shock.\r"

These cases illustrate the potential for serious infections in patients with COPD treated with corticosteroids.\r"

Following an acute trial, each patient was restudied after (1) two months of drug administration, (2) one month of abstinence from therapy, and (3) an additional two months of therapy. Three of six patients had no long-term reduction of PVR after treatment; one showed a progressive increase. Of the three patients whose PVR was still reduced at the end of the second therapy period none showed a return of PVR to baseline during the abstinence phase, which may suggest that long-term reduction of pulmonary vascular tone may modify the vasoconstrictive component of this disease. The heterogeneous response of this small number of patients to sequential drug administration and withdrawal demonstrates the difficulty of interpreting previously reported clinical trials and underscores the need for a well-designed controlled study of vasodilator administration in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary tuberculosis in AIDS/ARC patients is an increasing problem. To assess the utility of acid-fast smears of pulmonary secretions in this patient population, we evaluated 38 AIDS/ARC patients with culture-positive pulmonary infection. A control group consisted of 57 non-AIDS/ARC patients, who also did not belong to an AIDS risk group, diagnosed during the same period. The number of culture-positive sputum samples evaluated per patient was similar in both groups (3.82 +/- 3.11 AIDS/ARC vs 4.47 +/- 2.83 control group). Significantly fewer AIDS/ARC patients, 45 percent, however, had a positive acid-fast smear compared with the control group, 81 percent (p less than 0.001). The initial sputum smear submitted was positive in only 29 percent of the AIDS/ARC group compared with 61 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.01). Further, greater than or equal to 5 negative smears were found in 60 percent of the evaluable AIDS/ARC patients compared with just 13 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.01). More extensive findings on chest roentgenograms were not associated with a significantly higher yield of smear positivity in the AIDS/ARC group. We conclude that acid-fast smears on sputum specimens are a relatively insensitive test for pulmonary tuberculosis in AIDS/ARC patients.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive daytime sleepiness, the most prevalent symptom associated with the OSAS, is hypothesized to result from either fragmentation of sleep or hypoxemia during sleep. Measures of nocturnal sleep, respiration during sleep, and daytime sleepiness in 466 patients with apnea were collected to evaluate these two hypotheses. The various parameters were submitted to correlation and multiple regression analyses to predict daytime sleepiness as measured by the MSLT. The RAI, which measures the number of arousals from sleep associated with respiratory disturbances (best fragmentation correlation), produced a higher correlation with MSLT scores than did TMES (best hypoxemia correlation); however, the measures were highly intercorrelated, and multiple regression analyses to determine which parameters independently predicted MSLT showed the single best predictor to be the RAI. Additional independent variance in MSLT score was explained by TST and PSG1. Measures of hypoxemia provided little or no independent predictive information. These data support the hypothesis that sleep fragmentation is an important determinant of daytime sleepiness in patients with apnea.\r"
