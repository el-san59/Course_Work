  ".W": "For a decade, the authors have experimented with treatment for unresectable adult soft tissue and bony sarcomas. Over the last 6 years, they have combined hyperfractionated radiation therapy and intravenous iododeoxyuridine as a radiosensitizer, in regimens designed to minimize toxicity and permit delivery of aggressive radiation therapy. Patients with solitary lesions and those with metastasis (38%) were treated in the hope of both potential cure in some and durable palliation in others. The most formidable of these cancers have been those that are large or massive, often requiring five or more fields and extensive treatment planning. The authors report results from 36 patients with large unresectable sarcomas (tumors ranging from 5 to 35 cm; average 14 cm) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, follow-up of 4 or more years (in 50%), or follow-up until death. Overall local control has been 60%, with control of 66% of lesions from 5 to 9 cm, 63% of those from 10 to 14 cm, 63% of those from 15 to 19 cm, and 57% of those greater than 20 to 40 cm. Morbidity has been modest. This experience compares favorably with the authors' earlier trials with misonidazole, and toxicity has been reduced considerably.\r"

All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and the abdomen and ultrasound of the abdomen and supraclavicular regions. Supraclavicular lymph node metastases (Stage IV disease according to the tumor nodes metastasis [TNM] classification) were cytologically diagnosed in seven (18.9%) of the 37 patients. In two of these patients, no other metastases were found. In the other five patients, UGFAB replaced more invasive diagnostic procedures. Due to their superficial location, ultrasound and UGFAB of the supraclavicular lymph nodes was relatively simple to perform, and contributed to an improved staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "To further understand the molecular mechanisms and the biological indicators of colonic tumorigenesis, the authors examined tyrosine kinase activity in the cytosol and in the particulate fraction of the homogenates of specimens from 20 human colonic carcinomas and compared them with the adjacent normal mucosal tissues. Total protein tyrosine kinase activity could be precisely detected using miniphosphocellulose column purification and a synthetic peptide, Glu-asparagine (Asp)-alanine (Ala)-Glu-tyrosine (Tyr)-Ala-Ala-arginine (Arg)-Arg-Arg-glycine (Gly) (E11-G1), as an artificial substrate. Tyrosine kinase activity of colonic carcinoma and normal mucosa was reduced in the cytosol fraction whereas activity in the particulate fraction was elevated with respect to protein concentration. The average specific activity ratios were 1.95 +/- 0.27 (normal cytosolic/carcinoma cytosolic) and 0.57 +/- 0.01 (normal particulate/carcinoma particulate) for tyrosine kinase activity. Cellular distribution (% cytosol) of tyrosine kinase activity in normal mucosa and in carcinoma varied from 21.0% to 91.2% and from 7.0% to 61.4%, respectively. In nearly all cases the percentage of cytosolic tyrosine kinase activity in carcinoma tissues was lower than in normal tissues. There was no difference due to histologic type or the presence of adenomatous components. A significant decrease of cytosolic tyrosine kinases was correlated with Dukes' Stage A. With advancing Dukes' stage, the average specific activity ratios (normal cytosol/carcinoma cytosol) were decreased. This study indicates that colonic carcinogenesis might be associated with alterations in cellular levels of tyrosine kinase activity and that the average specific activity ratio (normal cytosol/carcinoma cytosol) had a possible correlation with colonic tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with well-differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer Stages Ia, Ib, Ic, and IIa (FIGO 1976) were observed after surgical treatment without adjuvant therapy. Careful surgical staging was required, and the extent of the staging procedure was assessed in each individual patient. There were 107 patients entered in the study by nine Dutch oncology centers. Of these 107, 21 did not fulfill all of the inlet criteria of the study and were excluded. Central pathologic review was performed in the remaining 86 cases, revealing that there was borderline tumor in seven patients, moderately or poorly differentiated tumor in nine patients, and tumor of nonepithelial histologic cell type in one patient. In two cases, no material for histologic review was available. After exclusion of these 19 cases, 67 patients were further analyzed. None of these 67 patients was lost during the follow-up period that ranged from 19 to 99 months (mean, 50 months). Tumor recurrence was found in four patients after 11, 25, 34, and 34 months of follow-up, all of whom died shortly after diagnosis of the recurrence without satisfactory response to secondary treatment. For the patients who underwent the most extensive staging procedure, disease-free 5-year survival was 100%. For the patients who were inaccurately staged, disease-free 5-year survival was 88%. It was concluded that well-differentiated early stage (Ia-IIa) ovarian cancer carries an excellent prognosis after surgical treatment and complete surgical staging, with the possible exception of patients with Stage Ic disease with malignant peritoneal washings. Furthermore, it was considered that the application of more objective and consistent ways of assessing tumor grade should be encouraged. Surgical staging should be regarded as the golden standard in defining subsets of low-risk patients and should be included and clearly defined in future trials on early ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 42 high-grade lymphomas which were categorized according to the Kiel classification, the clinical significance of immune genotyping was studied. Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were investigated. In 33 cases the immune genotype confirmed the phenotype. In one case with equivocal phenotype a TCR beta-chain rearrangement proved the T-cell origin of the lymphoma. None of the cases showed a bigenotype. There were eight lymphomas with immunoglobulin and TCR beta-chain and gamma-chain genes in germline configuration, which were divided into a group of immature lymphomas and a group of lymphomas with a more mature phenotype. The immature lymphomas had widespread disease, rapid progression, and favorable prognosis after intensive chemotherapy. The group of T-cell and Ki-1 lymphomas with null-cell genotype was clinically heterogeneous. Three of four cases were secondary lymphomas after lymphomatoid papulosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, or Hodgkin's disease. All cases presented with extranodal involvement. Only one of these patients is in continuous remission. In conclusion, the lack of immunoglobulin and TCR beta-chain and gamma-chain gene rearrangements does not exclude the diagnosis of high-grade malignant lymphoma, especially in cases with unusual extranodal involvement. However, the DNA analysis identifies a null-cell genotype subset of high-grade lymphomas which may have clinical significance.\r"

To define the clinical relevance the authors determined the serum IAP levels in 194 patients with malignancies before initiation of therapy, 14 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 28 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 23 healthy volunteers. Immunosuppressive acidic protein was measured by radial immunodiffusion. The mean value of our controls was 405 +/- 48 micrograms/ml. This is consistent with published data. The mean values for patients with malignancies varied from 554 micrograms/ml to 698 micrograms/ml. These are only marginally higher than those observed for the controls. In contrast patients with bacterial pneumonia demonstrated significantly elevated values (1038 +/- 261 micrograms/ml). The authors conclude that IAP cannot be used as a diagnostic marker for the malignant diseases examined in this study.\r"

H-antigen staining within the entire tumor did not correlate with the stage of the tumor, i.e., spread of the tumors. However, loss of staining within the most invasive sites of the tumors correlated significantly with the stage of tumor development and histologic grade of malignancy. These findings support the view that features relating to the cells of deeper parts of the carcinomas are very important for the clinical behavior of the tumors, and that loss of H-antigen expression is related to the stage of tumor and invasion of carcinoma cells.\r"

Antibodies RNL-2 and RNL-3 are directed against different epitopes on the same proteinaceous complex. Both MoAb recognize an intracellularly located, water-soluble antigen which has a subunit composition with a protein triplet ranging in molecular weight between 44 and 45 kilodaltons (kD) next to a component of approximately 30 kD. The antibodies RNL-2 and RNL-3 reacted with a subset of neuroendocrine tissues and neuroendocrine neoplasms. In lung cancer both antibodies reacted only with some SCLC and carcinoids and not with nonneuroendocrine lung carcinomas. The potential diagnostic applicability of antibodies RNL-1, RNL-2, and RNL-3 is discussed.\r"

The presence of the mutations did not correlate with the severity of cellular atypia, but was apparently related to the size of the tumor. The two neoplasms that had no mutations were smaller than the others that had mutations. The analysis suggested that Ras gene mutation is not the first genetic alteration of tumor progression, but that it occurs during the development of neoplasms of the pancreas.\r"

The year 1972 marked the onset of use of effective chemotherapy in osteosarcoma, namely, high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue. It would appear that the pathologic features and behavior of osteosarcoma in young children is similar to that of osteosarcoma in older children and adolescents. A combination of complete (wide) surgical resection or amputation and aggressive chemotherapy offers the best chance of long-term survival.\r"

The survival curves of patients with adenosquamous carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas indicated that the outcome of adenosquamous carcinoma was poorer than that of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in Stages I and II. The amount of adenocarcinoma component did not affect the survival rate, although the histologic features of metastatic lymph nodes was somewhat influenced by the histologic type of the primary tumors. The histologic subtype of adenosquamous carcinoma was one of the independent prognostic determinants.\r"

Anti-vimentin positively identified 86% of the mesotheliomas and none of the adenocarcinomas. AE1/AE3, EAB902, and B72.3 reacted with a high percentage of both mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma specimens. With HMFG-2, both membrane and cytoplasmic staining was observed in 92% of the adenocarcinomas and in 14% of the mesotheliomas, whereas 26% of the mesotheliomas only exhibited membrane staining. Eighty percent of the adenocarcinomas and 8% of the mesothelioma tissues stained with anti-Leu-M1. Anti-CEA did not react with any of the 50 mesotheliomas tested but did react with 95% of the lung adenocarcinomas tested. From this study, it was concluded that anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 were the most effective of the seven tumor markers evaluated; and that 100% of the pleural mesothelioma tissues could be correctly differentiated from lung adenocarcinomas using a panel consisting of anti-vimentin, HMFG-2, anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 monoclonal antibodies.\r"

This report describes the cytologic patterns of 50 cases of HCC in terms of histologic pattern observed in cell blocks prepared from the same aspiration specimen and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Tumors were classified according to the predominant pattern. Thirty-two cases gave the trabecular pattern. Smears could be subdivided into a central-sinusoidal pattern (23 cases) and a peripheral-sinusoidal pattern (nine cases). One case gave the pseudoglandular pattern. Seventeen cases gave the compact pattern with inconspicuous sinusoids. In all cases sinusoids were easily recognized in cell block sections. Other cytologic features such as intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, eosinophilic globules, and bile secretion could be seen in both smears and cell blocks. Mallory's hyalin and ground glass inclusions were only recognized in cell blocks. More attention should be paid to the sinusoidal stroma for diagnosis of HCC in FNA; cell blocks should be more widely utilized to this effect; cytologic patterns could be classified according to the WHO histologic classification.\r"

Most of these patients exhibited features of the \"choriocarcinoma syndrome\" with bulky, rapidly progressive disease; frequent pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous system complications; and a generally poorer response to standard NSGCT chemotherapy. Histologic identification of trophoblastic tumor was not made in all patients and is not essential for the diagnosis of the syndrome; indeed, closed biopsy may be contradicted in some circumstances because of the risk of hemorrhage.

  ".W": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) in an 11-year-old child with pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the beginning of induction therapy was observed, connected with a pulmonary thrombosis and not with an infective origin. A systematic search for this pathology identified six other children with the same pulmonary complication, five of whom where in the early phase of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and one in induction therapy for ALL in marrow relapse. At the beginning of the symptomatology, all children presented severe hypoxia and hypercapnia, with no or minimal chest radiograph abnormalities and no clear hemodynamic involvement. In all patients the arteriography and nuclear imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis. The causes of the thrombi could be connected with neoplastic emboli after cell lysis and/or with the vascular damage resulting from antiblastic therapy. Intravenous urokinase treatment and respiratory assistance had been successfully carried out in six of seven children.\r"

  ".W": "By means of a mail questionnaire, information on a series of 56 pregnancies i in 48 women diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma was collected from ten hospitals. Seven patients conceived while receiving treatment for their neoplasms; in 22 patients, the hematologic disease was diagnosed during pregnancy, and the remaining 27 patients became pregnant after completion of the antineoplastic treatment. When a comparison was made of the evolution of these pregnancies to that of pregnancies in a healthy population, no increase in the incidence of complications was observed: 64% of the pregnancies went to term, 9% resulted in spontaneous abortion, and 5% resulted in premature births. The observed incidence of one major malformation in 56 pregnancies did not differ from the frequency of malformations in the offspring of healthy individuals. There were no fetal losses in six pregnancies in which conception occurred during the first year after chemotherapy. In spite of the inherent limitations derived from the design of this type of study and the type of subject analyzed, the data here support the hypothesis that the cytostatic treatment of hematologic malignancies, if deemed necessary, should not be postponed because of pregnancy. Moreover, the authors agree with advice recommending that no antifolic or alkylating agents be used for prolonged periods and that radiotherapy be avoided, especially to those fields involving the pelvic area.\r"

The mean time from diagnosis of trilateral retinoblastoma to death was 6.6 months, and all patients died with spinal metastases. The patients who received no therapy survived an average of 1.3 months after the diagnosis of trilateral disease. The patients who received any form of definitive therapy survived 9.7 months. Five patients who had complete or dramatic response to therapy by computed tomography scans had local intracranial tumor present at autopsy. Therefore, more aggressive local therapy may be warranted.\r"

Median weight loss was 5 kg; 259 patients (31%) experienced no weight loss. By logistic regression analysis the authors found that weight loss increased with age and advancing stages of disease (TNM Stage I-IV), with decreasing Karnofsky index, in Lauren's diffuse versus intestinal tumor type, and with tumors located at the cardia/esophagus. Increasing weight loss reduced the resectability rate significantly, but no association between weight loss and postoperative complication rate was found. The odds ratio for postoperative mortality was 2.5 to 1 for the weight loss group 5 to 10kg versus 0 kg. In conclusion, weight loss reflects a less favorable tumor status. Weight loss did not increase postoperative morbidity but did lead Weight to a higher death rate after surgery.\r"

Variables concerning dietary intake of Zn and Cu (in Milan) and their blood levels (both in Milan and Montpellier) were measured. Dietary intake, evaluated through a questionnaire of the dietary history type, and blood levels of Zn and Cu were measured in 261 cases and 261 controls. Cu blood level showed a contradictory tendency in the two samples (higher in controls in Milan, higher in cases in Montpellier), which tended to lessen after adjustment for related variables. No odds ratios (OR) in the different quantiles, nor X2 for trend reached statistical significance. A sharp difference was evidenced on the opposite with regard to Zn blood values in cases and controls. In both samples Zn mean values are significantly higher in cases than in controls, and the difference remains significant in the two samples even after adjustment for related variables. The pooled OR computed from the two samples, after adjustment for known risk factors and related variables, reaches in the fourth quartile a value of 9.5 (CI: 4.9-18.2). Dietary intake of the two minerals (measured only in Milan sample) showed no difference between cases and controls, but a stronger relationship between dietary and blood Zn was evidenced in cases with respect to controls. The authors suggest that the higher Zn level in cases might be related with an higher incorporation of Zn in cancer cases and that the same mineral might play a possible role in tumor growth promotion.\r"

Results show that lung cancer rates are rapidly accelerating among Japanese males as a consequence of their prior history of heavy cigarette smoking. Oropharyngeal cancer rates are also rising in Japan paralleling increases in alcohol and tobacco utilization. As the Japanese life-style and diet continue to become more \"westernized,\" the rates of malignancies of the breast, ovary, corpus uteri, prostate, pancreas, and colon also continue to rise. Nevertheless, the mortality patterns of certain malignancies, viz., laryngeal, esophageal, and urinary bladder cancer, are discrepant with their established risk factor associations, suggesting the existence of other differences in risk factor exposure between the two countries. Epidemiologists and health educators need to develop innovative international programs of investigation and health promotion with preventive impact on common malignancies associated with risk factors of life-style.\r"

Understanding the mechanics of how these devices move the knee and the forces that can be applied to the knee is helpful in deciding on their use after ligamentous reconstructions. Rehabilitation of the knee following surgery requires a good understanding of the effects that each exercise has on the knee and the reconstruction. Gradual progression of exercises to the knee following knee ligament reconstruction will not overstress healing tissues. Many different types of knee braces exist, and careful evaluation of them may enhance patient recovery.\r"

The practical mechanical function of these braces is to reduce the lateral displacement of abnormal patellofemoral tracking. Orthotics that are designed and tested using practical biomechanical principles for applying a medially directed force to the patella seem to have a role in treating patients with knee pain secondary to patellar malalignment and instability.

  ".W": "In an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic knee bracing and to determine the influence of brace design and material characteristics on the protection of knee ligaments, a series of biomechanical studies were completed. The first series of tests were preliminary parametric tests of brace function utilizing cadaver limbs to understand the failure biomechanics of the medial restraints during low- and high-rate valgus-producing knee trauma. Static and dynamic mechanical properties of the braces were also studied. Finally, a limited series of brace/cadaver knee low-rate loading response tests were performed. With the information obtained from preliminary testing, an instrumented surrogate knee was developed and validated for lateral impact responses. The surrogate allowed for the measurement of ligament force time response during a controlled impact. Special impact facilities were constructed to allow the measurement and control of impact momentum. The effectiveness of six different prophylactic braces in preventing MCL and ACL injury was evaluated using the surrogate and impact facility. Impact parameters of mass, velocity, knee flexion angle, and limb restraint were varied to simulate different direct lateral impact conditions of game play. Testing results were normalized and expressed as an impact safety factor to allow for comparison of braces. An ISF of 1.5 (representing a ligament force reduction of 30%) was arbitrarily chosen as the minimum standard for brace performance. The majority of prophylactic knee braces tested proved to be biomechanically inadequate for protecting the MCl from a direct lateral impact. A few, however, appear to protect the ACL preferentially. In the case of a controlled, direct lateral blow, all but a few braces tested provided some beneficial protection to the MCL and ACL, but performed well below the standard 1.5 ISF level. Therefore, based on the biomechanical research, it is our opinion that the concept of prophylactic lateral knee bracing can be effective. We recommend that prophylactic braces not be abandoned, but rather improved, biomechanically validated, and further evaluated through well-controlled prospective clinical studies.\r"

One possible way to combat the problem of teenage sexual activity is to promote sexuality education within the family. The purpose of this study was to increase parent-child communication about sex through an educational program for parents. The effect of the educational program was evaluated by a nonrandomized, controlled trial. Volunteer parents were recruited from three middle schools (grade six through eight) located in middle to upper-middle socioeconomic class neighborhoods. The parents participated in four 2-hour sessions which included factual information about sexuality and exercises to improve communication skills. The experimental group (N = 47) were requested to fill out questionnaires immediately before and one month after the program. The control group (N = 17) were requested to fill out questionnaires one month before and again immediately before the program. Parents were asked to report the number of times they talked with their adolescents about 11 sex-related topics. The difference in reported frequency of communication before and after the program was compared using a two-tailed, matched pairs t-test. Twenty-four (51%) experimental group parents and eight (47%) control group parents completed both questionnaires. There was a significant increase in communication reported by the experimental group. The mean difference of the number of topics discussed was 10.9 (SD 7.3) for participants versus -2.5 (SD 5.9) for controls (p = .00053). This study shows that parent-child communication about sex can be facilitated by an educational program for parents.\r"

All isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone. An additional patient had L. pneumophila diagnosed by serology. Cure was achieved in 142 (96.6%) patients; improvement was usually observed within 24-48 hours. After 48 hours, 121 (82.2%) children could be discharged and continued the therapy on ambulatory basis. Based on previous experience we estimated that 383 hospitalization days were saved. No serious side effects were observed. Five patients were considered therapeutic failures; two of them developed empyema and one of them required repeated drainage procedures. A third patient experienced a relapse of pneumonia shortly after completion of therapy. The other two remained febrile for more than seven days; their subsequent improvement was unrelated to the antibiotic therapy, suggesting a viral or mycoplasmal syndrome. Our data suggest that once daily intramuscular ceftriaxone can be successfully used for the outpatient treatment of most community-acquired severe bacterial pneumonias in children. In our opinion it represents the treatment of choice for patients who failed treatment with other antimicrobials and are clinically stable enough not to require hospitalization.\r"

There was no agreement in regard to how long one should observe such patients before recommending intervention. There was no correlation of years of clinical experience and length of observation recommended either. Review of the pre-endoscopic literature revealed spontaneous evacuation in 93-99% of all types of foreign bodies in 1477 pediatric patients. An observation period of at least eight weeks should be strongly considered in an asymptomatic patient with a smooth-blunt gastric foreign body. Exceptions would include an anatomic abnormality of the gastric outlet, previous gastric outlet surgery as well as a possibly toxic object.\r"

Forty families (82%) responded regarding 42 of the 57 infants (74%). Only one child had a major health problem, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. All the children were in school. Thirty-nine (93%) were in a regular class and three (7%) were in special classes. Twenty-six children (67%) in a regular class did not require special educational assistance, 13 (33%) did. Using the Hollingshead Four Factor Index, socioeconomic status affected outcome P = 0.0068 (Fischer's exact test). There were 20 children in Classes I-III, upper socioeconomic and three children Class IV-V, lower socioeconomic, requiring no special education and six children in Class I-III and eight children in Class IV-V requiring special education. The neonatal risk factors birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of weight for gestation, Apgar score, time to regain birth weight, and time on mechanical ventilation did not affect outcome. The only neonatal risk which was significantly different between the respondents and nonrespondents was birth weight, P less than 0.020 for the children in a regular class without assistance and P less than 0.005 for children in a regular class with assistance. Overall, 40 percent of the children had repeated a grade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although numerous models are currently used for systematic study of the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in mature brain, few animal models have been developed that allow similar explorations in the developing nervous system. One experimental model of epilepsy supports a premise that perinatal experience can lead to eventual seizure susceptibility, however. Audiogenic seizure (AGS) susceptibility can be induced during a critical developmental period in normal mice by auditory deprivation and therefore by cochlear trauma. We studied the developmental parameters that affect success of both induction and testing of AGS-susceptibility in the rat. Intense high-frequency noise exposure was used as the traumatizing agent. The Wistar rat strain used is inherently seizure-resistant because in greater than 400 trials, untreated rats have never exhibited susceptibility at any age. Although single prolonged exposures to high-intensity noise were administered to groups of rats at ages between postnatal days (PNDs) 12 and 36, PND 14 was the age when exposure was most likely to result in eventual seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, duration of initial exposure on PND 14 determined the rate of susceptibility when measured 2 weeks later. Accordingly, we noted that single noise exposures at an intensity of 125 dB and ranging between 6 and 10 min in duration induced susceptibility in 100% of rats tested on PND 28; nonetheless, seizures among the rats exposed for 8 min were the most severe. Typically, these seizures began as wild running attacks and were followed by tonic/clonic convulsions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The principal changes in the serum concentrations of concomitant AEDs were (a) phenobarbital (PB) concentrations decreased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT; (b) total CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 48% and free CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT, with no change in CBZ-10, 11-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations; (c) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 19% on discontinuation of PHT; (d) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 42% on discontinuation of CBZ; (e) ethosuximide (ESM) concentrations increased by a mean of 48% on discontinuation of CBZ; (f) PHT concentrations decreased by a mean of 26% on discontinuation of CBZ; (g) PHT free fraction decreased from a mean of 0.11 to 0.07 on discontinuation of VPA; and (h) the mean concentrations of total and free CBZ increased by a mean of 10 and 16%, respectively, on VPA discontinuation, with a concomitant mean 24% decrease in total CBZ-E and a 22% decrease in free CBZ-E. Apart from the decrease in PB concentrations on PHT discontinuation, all significant changes had occurred by 1 week after the end of AED discontinuation. The implication for clinical practice is that a serum AED concentration at this time reflects the new steady state. Free concentrations did not add any clinically useful information to that gained from analysis of total serum concentrations.\r"

We studied 10 males and 12 females with a mean age of 36 years and a mean duration of CBZ-therapy of 4.4 years. Patients had been seizure-free for at least 1 month and took two daily CBZ doses. The test battery included tests of motor speed, reaction time, attention, and memory. In the experimental design, the subjects were tested twice at times close to expected daily maximum and minimum serum CBZ concentration. They were studied in two balanced blocks (block 1 tested at 8 a.m. and noon, block 2 tested at noon and 8 p.m.). Blood samples were collected every 2 hr from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The subjects showed significant differences in serum CBZ concentration between testing times, with suggested maximum concentration between 10 a.m. and noon. The test battery showed no consistent differences between performance at times of high versus low serum concentration. A supplementary analysis of correlations between mean performance level on cognitive tests and variables related to CBZ treatment did not show consistent trends.\r"

Phenytoin (PHT) produces a decrease in serum IgA and IgM levels and a decrease in blastic transformation of circulating lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemoagglutinin (PHA). The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) on the immune response are still conflicting. To elucidate the effects of CBZ on some immunologic parameters, serum concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgM, the phagocytosis and killing properties of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and the response of lymphocytes to mitogenic agents were studied. Forty healthy individuals and 39 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy (age range 18-40 years) entered the study. Student's t test was used to evaluate the data. CBZ had no effect on the serum immunoglobulin concentrations or on lymphocytic reactivity to phytohemoagglutinin (PHA) mitogen. CBZ produced a significant enhancement of phagocytosis and killing properties of PMNs and an increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity. Therefore, a negative effect of CBZ therapy on the immune system was not observed in this study.\r"

CBZ total concentrations were reduced during active FBM treatment (mean reduction 25%, range 10-42%, p less than 0.001). The effect was evident after the first week of treatment and reached a plateau in 2-4 weeks. To clarify the interaction mechanism, free and total concentrations of CBZ and its plasma metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrafiltration in four patients. In these patients, FBM treatment reduced CBZ concentrations and increased CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations (p less than 0.01). Free fractions of all compounds were unmodified. FBM appears to be capable of inducing CBZ metabolism. CBZ-FBM interaction may be clinically relevant.\r"

During kindling development, rats received carbamazepine (CBZ, 15mg/kg) before (CBZ-before) or after each amygdala stimulation (CBZ-after). After kindling to full seizures, when all animals were given CBZ before the stimulation, only the CBZ-after group showed a good anticonvulsant response. The rats that had received CBZ before (during development of kindled seizures) remained unresponsive to CBZ treatment (contingent inefficacy). When drug-naive or CBZ-after animals repeatedly received CBZ before electrical stimulation, they developed tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects (contingent tolerance). The tolerance could be reversed by a period of treatment with CBZ-after or by kindling the animal drug-free, but not by CBZ administration alone or by time off from both drug and seizures. These findings suggest that inefficacy and tolerance to CBZ may be affected by the temporal contingencies of drug administration and that responsiveness can be reinstated by altering these contingencies.\r"

Urinary excretion was determined after i.p. injection of a single dose of 200 mg/kg VPA, to which [14C]labeled VPA had been added to yield a dose of 1 microCi/kg body weight. Unlabeled VPA and metabolites were determined in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). After injection of a single dose of VPA before onset of chronic treatment, approximately 40-50% of the dose administered was excreted in the urine within 24 h, mainly in the form of conjugated VPA and omega-oxidation products, i.e., 5-hydroxy-VPA and 2-propyl-glutaric acid. After chronic treatment, urinary excretion of total radioactivity increased approximately 75% as compared with activity before chronic treatment, demonstrating a marked increase in elimination rate of VPA during prolonged administration. Determination of VPA and metabolites in urine by GC-MS indicated that this enhanced elimination resulted mainly from increases in glucuronidation and beta-oxidation of VPA, whereas omega-oxidation was apparently not altered or was even reduced. The data strongly indicate that at least in rats VPA produces induction of its own metabolism during prolonged treatment.\r"

None of the DBA/2 mice had been stimulated to seizure before or during the kindling and all mice were studied at 4-6 weeks of age, before development of spontaneous or movement-induced seizure activity in the El strain. The audiogenically seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice required the fewest number of stimulations to reach stage 5 seizure (mean +/- SE = 4.0 +/- 0.6). The nonepileptic C3H mice required the most stimulations to reach stage 5 seizures (22.6 +/- 1.4). Kindling rates for B6 (9.6 +/- 0.6), El (14.8 +/- 1.1), and ddY (18.5 +/- 1.0) strains were intermediate, and the kindling rate for each strain was significantly different from that of the other strains. These findings show that the seizure-susceptible El mouse kindles more rapidly than the genetically similar but nonepileptic ddY control and suggest that an inherited seizure susceptibility accelerates the kindling rate. Nonepileptic B6 mice kindled more rapidly than El mice, however, suggesting that genetic factors other than those that influence seizure susceptibility are of primary importance in the determination of the kindling rate.\r"

  ".W": "Local changes in cerebral glucose utilization during the postictal phase of amygdaloid-kindled generalized seizures were studied with the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method in conscious rats. Measurement was initiated either just after termination of a behavioral seizure (GS-I) or 30 s after seizure termination (GS-II) to determine dynamic metabolic changes in the postictal phase. Although glucose utilization of the neocortex was remarkably depressed in both GS-I and GS-II, that of the hippocampus significantly increased in GS-I and then decreased in GS-II as compared with control. These changes of hippocampal glucose utilization were observed in all sectors of the pyramidal cell layer (CA 1-4) and in the molecular layer. Because metabolic changes associated with development of amygdaloid-kindled seizures begin in the limbic structures including the hippocampus, the transient increase in hippocampal glucose utilization observed in the early postictal phase indicates that the hippocampus is one of the key structures not only for initiating and maintaining but also for terminating kindled seizures.\r"

The records contained no other abnormality in 51 patients (65%). Genuine epileptiform discharges were found in the records of 19 patients; 14 had a history of epilepsy. Thirty-five patients (45%) had a proven history of epilepsy with antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. In the records of these patients, the mean number of BETS per unit of time was significantly higher (11.88 +/- 2) than in the record of the rest of the laboratory population with BETS (6.89 +/- 0.9) (p less than 0.02). Among five conventional surface montages, ipsilateral ear referential montage (IERM) showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time than did any other surface montage used in the study. Thirty-nine records (50%) were performed after sleep deprivation (SD). When only IERM was considered, SD records showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time (7.36 +/- 1.1) than did non-SD records (3.89 +/- 0.69) (p less than 0.01). Our findings support the general consensus that individual BETS may be normal variants, but a high occurrence of BETS in the record should raise suspicion of underlying epilepsy.\r"

The EEG findings were characterized by sleep tracings showing almost continuous (greater than 95%), diffuse slow spike and wave activity. After treatment with valproate (VPA) (or ethosuximide, ESM) and clonazepam (CZP), the spike and wave complex status disappeared. Symptoms and signs of the CSWS also decreased. We suggest that combined treatment is an appropriate treatment for CSWS.\r"

Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to PNE. Forty infants with EEG-documented neonatal seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed for a mean of 31 months. PNE developed in 56% (15 of 27) of the cohort. The first seizure appeared at a mean-corrected age of 12.7 months and occurred despite ongoing antiepileptic medication in 60% (9 of 15) of the group. Seizures were classified as infantile spasms or minor motor (7 patients), complex partial (4 patients), or generalized tonic-clonic (4 patients). Perinatal variables that significantly correlated with PNE included the presence of coma but not the age at seizure onset, the estimated gestational age, or Apgar scores. PNE occurred in 68% (13 of 19) of patients with moderately or markedly abnormal EEG backgrounds but in only 25% (2 of 8) without (p = 0.035). There was a strong trend for PNE to develop in patients with greater than 10 electrographic seizures per hour but in only 45% (9 of 20) of infants with fewer seizures (p = 0.058). Several postnatal variables were significantly related to PNE--the presence of cerebral palsy (CP), mental retardation (MR), CP with MR, and follow-up EEGs. PNE occurred in only 27% (3 of 11) of patients without spikes or sharp waves on postnatal EEGs performed at age 3 months but in 100% (3 of 3) of patients with spikes or sharp waves (p = 0.022).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This finding indicates that environmental factors, particularly excessive sunshine, does not appear to influence the occurrence of PS among epileptic patients. The occurrence of PS among epileptic patients may depend more strongly on the presence of an epileptic syndrome known to have association with PS.\r"

The results of drug analysis led to alterations in management at 114 patients visits, i.e., 23% of those monitored. Dosage was increased in response to the circulating AED concentration in 12% of consultations and decreased in another 7.5%. Unsuspected poor compliance was uncovered in eight patients, and in three others an AED was added or discontinued on the basis of the assay result. The time of the next appointment was rearranged in 58 attendances. Only 50% of results were in the \"therapeutic\" ranges for the four major AEDs. Dosage was adjusted (50 up, 16 down) after 54% of low results. \"Therapeutic\" levels were followed by a change in AED dose (52 up, 31 down) in 26%. Only 29% of concentrations above the \"therapeutic\" range persuaded the doctor to alter the dosage regimen, and in 20% of these an increase in dose was recommended. On-site AED monitoring had an immediate impact on clinical decision-making in greater than 23% of consultations but in a form more subtle than the simple quest for a therapeutic result.\r"

We identified 141 patients meeting clinical and laboratory criteria for intoxication and 17 with clinical signs but with serum concentrations within the therapeutic range. The majority were epileptic patients; almost half were treated with monotherapy, most with phenytoin (PHT). The causes of intoxication in the epileptic patients were iatrogenic (41%), inappropriate dose self-adjustment (34%), suicide attempt (18%), inappropriate caretaker dose adjustment (9%), accidental ingestion (8%), unrecognized drug interaction (6%), and association with intercurrent illness (2%). Twenty-two patients had more than one probable cause of intoxication. In nonepileptic patients the causes were suicide attempt (50%), accidental ingestion (27%), and iatrogenic (23%). Most patients had signs of ocularmotor and vestibulocerebellar dysfunction. Rarely described manifestations of intoxication, such as seizures or choreoathethosis, were observed in a few patients. The average hospital stay was 6.9 days; there was no mortality, and all patients recovered fully. We conclude that AED intoxication is a major but preventable cause of morbidity and that suicide attempts are an important and underrecognized contributor in both epileptic and non-epileptic patients.\r"

A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease.\r"

The results were compared to the number of Ig-containing plasma cells in the test segment. There was, respectively, a two-fold and a fivefold increase in jejunal secretion rates of IgA (both monomeric and polymeric) and IgM in patients with coeliac disease compared with control subjects. The high IgA and IgM secretion rates parallel the increase of Ig-containing plasma cells in the lamina propria. In contrast, the IgG plasma cell density increase was barely significant in patients with coeliac disease and did not result in a high IgG secretion rate. The jejunal secretion rate of secretory component was significantly increased in patients with coeliac disease and no free dimeric IgA was present in the jejunal fluid. Antigliadin-IgA was detected in the serum and jejunal fluid of the six patients with coeliac disease. Antigliadin-IgA, however, was almost entirely polymeric IgA linked to secretory component in jejunal fluid, whereas 61% was dimeric IgA not linked to secretory component in serum. This result, combined with a raised secretory component secretion rate with no evidence of secretory component saturation, suggests that serum and intestinal antigliadin IgA might be of different origins in coeliac disease.\r"

Citrate-ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid treatment removed enterocytes from any underlying lamina propria and produced single cells and strips of cells. A mean (SEM) of 4.39 (2.06) x 10(6) cells was obtained from nine duodenal biopsy specimens. Enterocyte recovery was estimated enzymatically using alkaline phosphatase activity and was found to be 61%. Cytological assessment of the cells with CAM 5.2 showed that 98% of the cells isolated were enterocytes with an intact brush border. The cells responded well to vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulation in the absence of an exogenously added adenosine triphosphate regenerating system. The addition of vasoactive intestinal peptide to duodenal enterocytes produced a biphasic dose dependent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Stimulation of these cells with 10(-13)M vasoactive intestinal peptide resulted in a 50% stimulation over basal value while 10(-6)M vasoactive intestinal peptide led to a fivefold increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. We conclude that duodenal biopsy specimens are a good source of human intestinal cells for the study of enterocyte physiology. The cells were viable and highly responsive to vasoactive intestinal peptide.\r"

The frequency of serum anticolon antibody was 71% in 41 patients with ulcerative colitis, estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using isolated rat colon epithelial cells. This finding confirms our previous report on the frequency of serum anticolon antibody detected by flow cytometry analysis. The estimated frequencies of IgG anticolon antibody secreting cells were 1.5-12.5/10(6) cells in the colonic mucosa and 0.1-0.5/10(6) cells in peripheral blood, from patients with ulcerative colitis when Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was used as a B cell polyclonal activator. Poisson analysis of limiting dilution culture showed that about one per 140 IgG cells in the colonic mucosa synthesised anticolon antibody. Two monoclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from EBV transformed anticolon antibody secreting cells by limiting dilution method. One reacted with goblet cells in the intestine, and the other reacted mainly with colonic epithelial cells. These results suggest that heterogeneous anticolon antibodies are present in patients with ulcerative colitis and that colonic mucosa may be the main source of anticolon antibody. Local autoimmune reaction might have an important role in causing the inflammation of colonic mucosa in this disease.\r"

Subsequently, three patients (17%) developed neoplasms including carcinoma in two and an adenomatous polyp in one. In colectomy specimens which showed dysplasia, significantly more dysplastic changes were found in seven patients who underwent colonic resection than in 10 others who underwent operation but had no prior dysplasia (p less than 0.001). Thirteen patients still have their rectum in situ and remain at risk of developing colonic cancer. Four carcinomas developed in patients with Crohn's disease who did not have dysplasia on rectal biopsy specimen.\r"

Sixty four (9.7%) of the 659 patients died. The cause of death was related to Crohn's disease in 34 patients, probably related to the disease in four, and unrelated, from incidental causes, in 25. The cause of death could not be identified in one patient. There was a significant decrease of deaths related to the disease after 1973. Causes of death such as amyloidosis and malnutrition have disappeared and postoperative deaths have decreased. The standardised mortality ratio showed an excess mortality of 2.23 for all patients. It was higher for women (3.30) than for men (1.76). A comparison of two recent 10 year periods showed a significant decrease in standardised mortality ratio in men but not in women. Patients whose disease started before the age of 20 years had an excess mortality compared with older patients. This study supports the view that the prognosis of Crohn's disease has improved in general but high quality medical and surgical management is important particularly for younger patients.\r"

  ".W": "Colonic biopsy specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for carcinoma of the rectum. Colonic resistance arteries (internal diameter 178-345 microns) were dissected out under the microscope and mounted in a microvascular myograph capable of measuring isometric tension development. Experiments were designed to test compounds trophic to the gastrointestinal tract--namely, glutamine and the three short chain fatty acids, acetic, propionic, and butyric acid, for effects on vascular tone. Glutamine in concentrations up to 30 mM neither constricted nor dilated the resistance arteries. The three short chain fatty acids alone and in combination, however, caused a concentration-dependent (range 0.1-30 mM) dilatation of resistance arteries preconstricted with 50 mM K+, and this relaxant effect was unaffected by removal of the endothelium, presence of indomethacin, and preconstriction with vasopressin. These data suggest that the trophic effect of glutamine on intestinal mucosa cannot be explained through actions of this compound on the resistance vasculature. In contrast, the relaxant effect of short chain fatty acids on resistance arteries in vitro suggests that these compounds may be able to improve the colonic microcirculation in vivo, thereby providing an explanation for their trophic effect on intestinal mucosa.\r"

Outcome and anorectal function were compared with nine faecal incontinent patients who received medical therapy alone. Three month follow up showed that 50% of patients in the biofeedback plus conventional treatment group and 56% of those treated conventionally only had improved. One year follow up showed that 13% in the biofeedback group were free of soiling and an additional 25% had improved. The results were similar in the conventionally treated group--11% were free of soiling and an additional 44% improved. Anal pressures at rest and squeeze, the rectal distension volume that induced sustained inhibition of both the external and internal anal sphincter, and continence to rectally infused saline were significantly reduced in both groups of patients compared with controls (p less than 0.05). Biofeedback treatment had no effect on these abnormal anorectal functions in either patients who improved or those who did not. The improvement in faecal incontinence was probably due to medical intervention or regression of symptoms with time, or both, and not the result of biofeedback training.\r"

  ".W": "Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy. Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients. In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed, suggesting that, for lactulose at least, these effects are mediated by the gut flora. Measurement of the alpha-, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria. The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that, from the perspective of protein metabolism, lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.\r"

The total lipid concentration of the puncture bile samples was mean (SD) 11.9 (4.7) g/dl, significantly higher than the endoscopic bile samples (3.9 (3.3) g/dl, p less than 0.001). Total bile acids, phospholipids, and biliary cholesterol (expressed in mol%) and cholesterol saturation index showed no significant differences between the two types of samples. The glycocholic acid concentration in the endoscopically obtained bile (27.7 (6.6) mol% v 23.3 (5.4) mol%; p less than 0.01) was significantly higher than the puncture bile samples. Puncture bile exhibited a significantly shorter nucleation time (3.5 (3.3) days v 19.6 (11.9) days; p less than 0.001). For determination of the nucleation time, endoscopic bile aspiration after gall bladder stimulation with ceruletid led to adequately concentrated samples in 50% of the study subjects. Cholesterol monohydrate crystal formation in native bile was observed in six samples of puncture bile and in three samples of the endoscopically obtained bile. The presence of cholesterol crystals and the determination of nucleation time in the puncture bile were the best discriminants between cholesterol and pigment gall stones and correlated well with computed tomogram analysis.\r"

Concentrations of ethanol in venous blood and pancreatic juice were recorded for three hours. Similar studies were made when ethanol was administered as an intravenous priming dose followed by a maintenance infusion. After orally administered ethanol, pancreatic juice values were higher than those in blood for a short period of time. The relations between median concentrations and time were incongruous curves consistent with a significant treatment by time interaction. Intravenous administration resulted in a similar pattern, but the interaction was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that the human pancreas may secrete ethanol.\r"

After transformation to the adult form, the parasite preferentially localises in the small intestine, especially in the duodenal and jejunal part. A remarkable feature of Strongyloides is its property of endogenous reinfection. In the case of an immunocompromised host a massive infection, called hyperinfections Strongyloides, may occur. Numerous gastrointestinal complications of strongyloides infections, sometimes with a lethal outcome, have been reported. The intestinal manifestations are usually limited to the small bowel, and rarely involve the stomach. We report a patient with complicated strongyloides infection of the stomach.\r"

But a lot has changed since the young people (mostly young men) who took their MHAs from health administration programs left school. Although many started out with their eye on the hospital CEO prize, the 1970 grads have fanned out across the health care profession spectrum--and beyond. The kinds of changes in the health care field the 1970 MHA graduates have seen are the ones that have transformed health care in just two decades. PPS, managed care, the indigent care crisis, downsizing, the growth of systems, greater physician scrutiny and an avalanche of regulations of all types have fundamentally altered the health care career map. The 1970 grads will tell you--in their own words--what two decades of revolution have meant to them--and to all of us.\r"

All of the patients had been injured during athletic activities. Some degree of anterior labral injury was present in thirty-eight of the forty-two shoulders. Half of the patients had generalized ligamentous laxity. The patients were followed for an average of three years (range, two to seven years). Four patients had episodes of instability after the operation. Three had a single episode of posterior subluxation during throwing, one had recurrent posterior subluxation that subsequently was treated by posterior stabilization, and one had anterior subluxation while he was diving from a high board. The average loss of external rotation after the operation was 5 degrees with the arm at the side and 4 degrees with the arm abducted 90 degrees. Satisfaction of the patient was rated excellent for forty (95 per cent) of the shoulders, good for one shoulder, and fair for one shoulder. However, throwing athletes found that they were unable to throw a ball with as much speed as before the operation.\r"

The diagnostic sensitivity was 94 per cent for lesions of the medial meniscus; this value differed significantly from that of 78 per cent for lesions of the lateral meniscus (p less than 0.05). The 37 per cent specificity for lesions of the medial meniscus was extremely low compared with the rate of 69 per cent for lesions of the lateral meniscus (p less than 0.01). In the intermediate part of the meniscus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 37 per cent on the medial side and 23 per cent on the lateral side; these values were significantly less than the average of 74 per cent for the other meniscal segments (p less than 0.001). The imaging studies provided an over-all accuracy of 67 per cent in the detection of degeneration of the meniscus, 78 per cent in the identification of meniscal tears, and 82 per cent in the delineation of postoperative lesions.\r"

In sixty-two (73 per cent) of the legs, the nerve coursed within the lateral muscle compartment from its origin to its exit through the crural fascia. In twelve (14 per cent) of the legs, the nerve had a variable course in the lateral compartment, crossed into the anterior compartment, and passed through the fascia. In ten (12 per cent) of the legs, the nerve divided in two, with branches in both the anterior and the lateral compartment. In one leg, the nerve never lay deep to the peroneus longus but ran along the deep surface of the fascia before exiting distally. The nerve or its branches passed through the fascia three to eighteen centimeters proximal to the lateral malleolus.\r"

Five groups of six dogs each were studied: dogs that had not had an operation (control group); dogs that had had a sham operation, with survival periods of three and six months; and dogs that had received an implant, with survival periods of three and six months. The results were the same in specimens from the control group and the group that had had a sham operation. In the groups that had received an implant, dual-photon absorptiometry revealed an insignificant decrease in bone-mineral content at the bypassed fourth lumbar segment (17 per cent at three months and 12 per cent at six months). When the data for the three and six-month intervals were pooled, the mean decrease in bone-mineral content of 14 per cent was significant. Histomorphic study yielded similar results; the mean decrease in bone-mineral content for the pooled three and six-month specimens was significant (16 per cent). Losses were similar for the ventral and dorsal columns. Histomorphometric analysis also showed a significant (13 per cent) loss of bone-mineral content at the adjacent caudad (sixth lumbar) vertebra for the pooled three and six-month groups. The results of the methods of analysis of loss of bone-mineral content correlated strongly. Under these experimental conditions, a stiff spinal implant caused loss of bone-mineral content of the bypassed vertebral segment, although the loss was less than anticipated and did not increase between three and six months.\r"

The parents of sixty-three additional patients who had a non-spinal orthopaedic diagnosis (control group) were matched for age and sex with the study group and were given the same interview. Of the patients who had herniation of a lumbar disc and were less than twenty-one years old, 32 per cent had a positive family history for that lesion compared with 7 per cent of the control group. The relative risk of development of herniation of a lumbar disc before the age of twenty-one years is estimated to be approximately five times greater in patients who have a positive family history. The results indicate a familial basis for herniation of a lumbar disc in patients who are less than twenty-one years old.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated 100 per cent sensitivity and 95 per cent specificity in the diagnosis of complete tears, and it consistently predicted the size of the tear of the rotator cuff. There was a definite correlation between atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle and the size of a complete, chronic tear of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation of tendinitis from degeneration of the cuff were 82 and 85 per cent, and in the differentiation of a normal tendon from one affected by tendinitis with signs of impingement the sensitivity and specificity were 93 and 87 per cent. The formation of spurs around the acromion and acromiocalvicular joint correlated highly with increased age of the patient and with chronic disease of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of labral tears associated with glenohumeral instability were 88 and 93 per cent. The study showed that high-resolution magnetic-resonance imaging is an excellent non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of lesions of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral instability.\r"

The accuracy ranged from 64 to 95 per cent for the medial meniscus, from 83 to 94 per cent for the lateral meniscus, and from 78 to 97 per cent for the anterior cruciate ligament. The results from different magnetic-resonance units were also compared, and the findings suggested increased accuracy for the units that had a stronger magnetic field.

The Lachman, anterior drawer, posterior drawer, and pivot-shift tests were negative in all knees. All knees were stable to varus and valgus stress at both 0 and 30 degrees of flexion. The external-rotation recurvatum test also was negative in all knees. A positive reversed pivot-shift sign was present in 35 per cent of the knees, suggesting that it may not signify abnormality, at least not without a negative test on the contralateral knee. The results of the posterolateral drawer test were variable, difficult to quantify, and did not always have a firm end-point. The amount of maximum external rotation of the tibia, measured from the reference line of the medial border of the foot, was extremely variable at both 30 and 90 degrees of flexion of the knee. External rotation, as determined by this reference, was slightly greater (averaging 9 degrees) at 90 than at 30 degrees of flexion. The normal range of maximum external rotation of the foot was 10 to 45 degrees at 30 degrees of flexion of the knee and 15 to 70 degrees at 90 degrees of flexion. The presence of a large angle of external rotation and a positive reversed pivot-shift sign correlated strongly with increased ligamentous laxity and mild varus alignment of the knee.\r"

In a retrospective review of the records of forty-two patients who had chronic granulomatous disease, we identified thirteen patients who had a total of twenty skeletal infections. Two types of infection were noted: Type 1, which resulted from a direct spread of the infection from an adjacent focus, usually of fungus or mycobacteria, and Type 2, which resulted from hematogenous spread, usually of Nocardia or more common bacteria. The thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and metatarsals were the most commonly involved bones. All four patients in whom the vertebrae were involved had a Type-1 fungal infection. Paresis developed in three of these patients, and two of them died. Antibiotics alone effectively eradicated the infection in only one patient. Wide operative debridement combined with administration of antibiotics was the most successful treatment. Comprehensive preoperative imaging and several cultures are necessary to locate the infection in the bone and to identify the organism.\r"

In 88 per cent of the patients, the transfer was successful in improving or maintaining abduction, extension, functional walking, and stability of the hip. The failures were all in patients who were unable to walk and who had spastic quadriplegia. Tenotomy of the iliopsoas tendon at the time of the transfer procedure resulted in an improved range of motion of the hip.\r"

Transected intrasynovial flexor tendons were repaired either immediately or after a delay of seven or twenty-one days. The biomechanical, biochemical, and morphological characteristics were compared at three and six weeks. The values for angular rotation, linear excursion, ultimate load, and linear slope were determined; concentrations of collagen and reducible collagen cross-links, an index of newly synthesized collagen, were measured; and the ultrastructural morphology of the tendons was examined by high-voltage electron microscopy. For the tendons that were repaired immediately, the values for angular rotation were 9.4 +/- 3.2 and 13.0 +/- 3.7 degrees at three and six weeks; for those that were repaired at seven days, 4.1 +/- 1.3 and 2.5 +/- 1.4 degrees; and for those that were repaired at twenty-one days, 2.7 +/- 0.8 and 4.7 +/- 0.7 degrees. There was a significant effect of the delay until repair on the angular rotation and linear excursion in all three groups (p less than 0.005 for both). Tensile testing of the bone-tendon complex revealed no significant effect of the delay on the values for ultimate load (p greater than 0.05). There were no significant differences in total concentration of collagen at the sites of repair or in the levels of reducible Schiff-base cross-links (indicators of newly synthesized cross-links) in tendons from the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transfusion of homologous blood was minimized through transfusion of preoperatively deposited autologous blood, intraoperative and postoperative salvage of washed red blood cells, and use of the clinical condition of the patient as the sole criterion for transfusion of non-autologous blood, regardless of the hematocrit. The cases of 143 patients who had had 154 primary total hip replacements were studied. One hundred and forty-three procedures were done on patients who had not been prevented from donating blood for medical reasons, and 93 per cent of these 143 procedures were performed with the availability of one to five units of preoperatively deposited autologous blood. The patients predeposited an average of 2.6 units of blood for each procedure. Ninety-two per cent of the procedures for which autologous blood had been predeposited were performed without transfusion of homologous blood. In the entire group of patients, almost 90 per cent of the transfused blood was autologous blood. Intraoperative salvage of red blood cells was successful in 148 procedures, and salvage was continued in the recovery room for all of these patients. An average of 408 milliliters of red blood cells was saved and reinfused, and this was 28 per cent of the average total loss of blood (1435 milliliters) for this series of procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the most recent follow-up examination (at an average duration of nineteen years after the onset of the disease), 80 per cent of the hips that had been affected by avascular necrosis during childhood were painful and had permanent damage with regard to decreased mobility, limb-length discrepancy, and an abnormal gait. When the patients were evaluated, at an average age of thirty-one years, fifteen hips (16 per cent) had had an operation for progressive disability and sixty (63 per cent) had major problems because of pain. Of the twenty hips (21 per cent) that were not painful, five were in patients who had an abnormal gait, with decreased agility. The mean Iowa hip-rating score at the most recent follow-up examination was 73 points (range, 30 to 100 points). Correlations were found between the hip score and the patient's age at the onset of the disease and at the latest follow-up, between the hip score and degenerative changes in the hip, and between degenerative changes and radiographic evidence of deformity of the hip.\r"

  ".W": "An osseous defect was created in the acetabulum and femur of twenty dogs, and then a fiber-metal total hip prosthesis was inserted. A comparison was made between the effects of leaving the defects unfilled, filling the defects with an autogenous bone graft, and filling them with a 50:50 mixture of autogenous bone graft and a biphasic ceramic composed of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate. The characteristics of formation of bone within the sites of the defects and the extent of the ingrowth of bone into the underlying porous surface were analyzed. At six and twelve weeks after implantation, the dogs in the control group (unfilled defects) had the least amount of bone in the sites of the defects. In the dogs that had had an autogenous bone graft and those in which the defects had been filled with a mixture of autogenous bone graft and biphasic ceramic, there were excellent osteoconductive properties in the filling of the sites of the defects with new bone. A comparison was made between the amount of bone that formed in the osseous defects and the amount that formed in the spaces of the porous-surfaced fiber-metal components of the prostheses, directly underlying and adjacent to the defects. At six weeks, the greatest amount of ingrowth of bone into the spaces of the underlying titanium fiber-metal acetabular components was seen in the control group (22 per cent of the porous surface), followed by the group in which the defects had been filled with a mixture of autogenous bone graft and biphasic ceramic (19 per cent). The defects that had been filled only with autogenous bone graft had poor ingrowth of bone into the porous surface (4 per cent) and predominantly fibrous ingrowth. At twelve weeks, these defects again showed the least amount of ingrowth of bone (15 per cent) compared with the defects in the control group (24 per cent) and those that had been filled with a mixture of autogenous bone graft and biphasic ceramic (24 per cent). No statistically significant differences were found in the amount of ingrowth of bone into the defects that had been created in the femur in the three groups of dogs at either six or twelve weeks. However, the trends appeared to correlate with the data for the acetabular defects.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperthyroidism is accompanied by various neuroendocrine regulatory disturbances that affect not only the thyrotropic, but also the gonadotropic, corticotropic, and somatotropic axes. To examine the nature of alterations in neuroendocrine control mechanisms that direct the somatotropic axis in hyperthyroidism, we have applied a novel deconvolution technique designed to estimate the number, amplitude, and mass of significant underlying GH secretory events after the influence of GH metabolic clearance has been removed mathematically. To this end, blood was sampled at 10-min intervals for 24 h in seven hyperthyroid and seven age-matched euthyroid men. The subsequent GH time series were assayed by immunoradiometric assay (sensitivity, 0.08 ng/mL) and submitted to quantitative deconvolution analysis. We found that hyperthyroid compared to euthyroid men 1) had significantly more GH secretory bursts per 24 h (viz. 15 +/- 1.0 vs. 10 +/- 1.1; P = 0.017); 2) secreted 3 times as much GH per burst (3.7 +/- 0.80 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.42 ng/mL distribution vol; P = 0.013); 3) achieved a maximal rate of GH secretion in each burst 2.3-fold higher than that in control men (0.14 +/- 0.028 vs. 0.060 +/- 0.015 ng/mL.min; P = 0.017); and 4) had 3.7-fold higher 24-h endogenous GH production rates (P less than 0.01). Neither hyperthyroid nor euthyroid men had significant interburst (tonic) GH secretion. We conclude that the somatotropic axis in hyperthyroid men is marked by a higher frequency of spontaneous GH secretory bursts, a higher rate of maximal GH secretion attained per burst, and a larger mass of GH released per burst. These neuroregulatory disturbances result in a nearly 4-fold increase in the 24-h production rate of GH in thyrotoxicosis.\r"

The infusions resulted in elevation of blood levels of immunoreactive GIP into the upper range of those observed after ingestion of large mixed meals. This was accompanied by significant increments in immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) in the plasma. Similar infusions in two cirrhotic patients with surgical porta-caval anastomoses who had normal plasma IRG levels in the postabsorptive state had no effect on the plasma IRG level. Ingestion of triglyceride (60 g) in hyperglucagonemic cirrhotic patients with porta-caval anastomoses also resulted in elevation of plasma immunoreactive GIP, and this was again associated with significant elevation of the plasma IRG level. Chromatography studies showed that the increments in plasma IRG after the administration of GIP or triglyceride were largely accounted for by increases in pancreatic-type glucagon. There were no significant effects of administration of GIP or triglyceride on the blood levels of glucose or immunoreactive insulin. It is concluded that porcine GIP is glucagonotropic in patients with cirrhosis of the liver who show elevated levels of IRG in the plasma in the postabsorptive state. This effect is not due to diversion of portal blood to the systemic circulation and may be attributable to hypersensitivity of the alpha-cells to stimulation by GIP.\r"

Each patient received an iv dose of 25 muCi [125I]rT3 during the fed control period, on days 7 and 13 of the fast, and on the fourth day after refeeding with a regular diet. Serial blood and urine samples were obtained to determine serum rT3 clearance and production rates and the urinary tracer rT3 deiodination fraction. Significant increases in serum rT3 values were noted by day 7 and remained elevated for the duration of the fast (P less than 0.01). Normalization of rT3 levels occurred after 4 days of refeeding. Both 7 and 13 days of fasting decreased rT3 clearance [132.6 +/- 8.3 L/day (P less than 0.001) and 132.2 +/- 9.5 L/day (P less than 0.001), respectively] without changing rT3 production (36.8 +/- 5.3 and 33.0 +/- 3.7 nmol/D, respectively) compared to control values (207.0 +/- 10.9 L/day and 31.8 +/- 3.8 nmol/day, respectively). Refeeding did not restore rT3 clearance (151.2 +/- 6.9 L/day; P less than 0.002), but significantly reduced blood rT3 production (18.4 +/- 3.8 nmol/day; P less than 0.003). The fractional deiodination of rT3 was significantly reduced on day 7 (42.5 +/- 4.6%; P less than 0.01) and day 13 (41.9 +/- 3.7%; P less than 0.01) of fasting compared to the control value (69.2 +/- 2.8%), while refeeding only partially restored deiodination to baseline (48.4 +/- 5.1%; P less than 0.04). The clearance of rT3 was highly dependent on the fractional deiodination rate (r = 0.83; P less than 0.001). Although rT3 production remained constant during fasting, reduced rT3 production was seen on the fourth day of refeeding. This unique observation explained the fall in serum rT3 to prefasting levels after 4 days of refeeding when rT3 clearance was still inhibited. This study, in context with previous investigations, indicates that T4 conversion to circulating T3 and rT3 in fasting is a highly complex and multifaceted process requiring further investigation to elucidate the mechanism responsible for these alterations.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) were evaluated for their metabolic bone disease (4 men and 6 women; mean +/- SD, 59 +/- 13 yr). All patients presented with generalized osteopenia and/or atraumatic vertebral compression fractures. Three patients had long-standing urticaria pigmentosa; in these, the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis had been established by skin biopsy. One of the 3 and 2 of the other 7 individuals had symptoms suggestive of SM. Although six patients had previously undergone decalcified bone marrow trephine core biopsy (DBMB), findings were consistent with SM in only 2 of them. X-Ray survey revealed generalized osteopenia in all 10 patients and vertebral compression fractures in 9. No patient had sclerotic bone lesions. Histological findings of undecalcified transiliac crest biopsy (UTBB) specimens from 9 patients (5 patients underwent both DBMB and UTBB, 4 underwent only UTBB, and 1 had only DBMB) disclosed bone marrow that contained nodules characteristic of mast cell granulomas and numerous scattered oval- and spindle-shaped mast cells. The trabecular bone contained abundant newly synthesized bone matrix and a significant increase in osteoblastic, osteoclastic, and resorptive surfaces. Dynamic histomorphometric parameters revealed a significantly increased mineral apposition rate. Our study suggests that SM may be a more frequent cause of osteoporosis than previously recognized. Generalized osteopenia with compression fractures may be the only presentation of SM. Undecalcified bone biopsy is useful in the diagnosis of SM. Accelerated bone remodeling is a characteristic histomorphometric feature of SM with diffuse osteopenia.\r"

  ".W": "A constellation of neuroendocrine secretory aberrations, including reduced LH pulse frequency and PRL concentrations, has been documented in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). As pituitary function was preserved, these aberrations were attributed to an alteration in hypothalamic neuromodulation. To investigate the participation of the dopaminergic system in the genesis of the reduced LH pulse frequency and suppressed PRL levels in FHA, we studied six women with FHA and six cyclic women in the early follicular phase by obtaining blood samples at 15-min intervals for 48 h during sequential 24-h infusions of saline and a dopamine receptor blocker, metoclopramide (MCP). A hypothalamic vs. pituitary site of action was inferred from the pulsatility characteristics. MCP consistently elicited an increase in the LH pulse frequency in the women with FHA [7.3 +/- 1.2 (+/- SE) to 10.5 +/- 1.3 pulses/24 h; P less than 0.005]. In contrast, the eumenorrheic women did not show a significant change in LH pulse frequency in response to MCP (15.2 +/- 1.0 to 14.3 +/- 0.9 pulses/24 h). While the PRL concentrations were significantly lower in the FHA group during the infusion of saline (P less than 0.001) and MCP (P less than 0.005), the relative increases in PRL during MCP were similar in both groups. The acceleration of LH pulse frequency by blockade of dopamine receptors implies that there is increased hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency in women with FHA.\r"

Since normal alveolar macrophages are known to synthesize 1,25-(OH)2D3 when stimulated with gamma-interferon or lipopolysaccharide, we determined whether macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes could be an extrarenal source of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Our results demonstrated that macrophages from normal individuals synthesize 1,25-(OH)2D3. The apparent Km for 25OHD3 was 6.6 +/- 0.5 nM and the maximum velocity was 47.4 +/- 13.7 fmol 1,25-(OH)2D3/h.microgram DNA. The activity of this enzyme was reduced 37.2 +/- 3.1% by physiological concentrations (96 pmol/L) of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the incubation medium. Normal macrophages further hydroxylated 1,25-(OH)2D3 to more polar metabolites, and this catabolic activity was significantly enhanced by physiological concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3. In chronic renal failure, peripheral macrophages exhibited an enhanced 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (8.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.5 fmol 1,25-(OH)2D3/microgram DNA.h in controls) and a decreased capacity to degrade 1,25-(OH)2D3. Exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3, in physiological concentrations, reduced 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis to a degree (23.6 +/- 8.5%) comparable to that observed in normal cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by macrophages did not correlate with the severity of hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, human PTH-(1-34) in supraphysiological concentrations (20,000 and 100,000 ng/L) did not stimulate the 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity of macrophages from either normal or uremic subjects. These results demonstrate that 1) normal peripheral macrophages metabolize 25OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3; 2) macrophages in uremia display higher rates of 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis and lower rates of catabolism than normal macrophages; and 3) 1,25-(OH)2D3 deficiency, but not hyperparathyroidism, may play a role in the stimulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by macrophages in chronic renal failure.\r"

Its biosynthesis and secretion from the ovary are regulated by gonadotropins. In the present study we measured PR and steroid levels in FF from 136 follicles. Follicular fluids were obtained, 36 h after hCG injection, from 41 ovarian-stimulated patients who underwent follicle puncture and oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization. We related FF PR to steroid levels and to the stage of oocyte-cumulus complex maturation. PR levels in 62 FF containing mature healthy fertilized oocytes averaged 2620 +/- 157 (+/- SE) ng/mL.h (728 +/- 44 ng/L.s; range, 1020-6880 ng/mL.h, 283-1911 ng/L.s). A subgroup of 16 of these follicles containing mature oocytes were from 7 women who conceived, in which PR levels spanned only the lower range from 1030-2720 ng/mL.h (286-756 ng/L.s). No patient conceived with FF PR above 2800 ng/mL.h (778 ng/L.s), yet one third of all mature follicles were above this range. Lower levels of PR were detected in FF containing immature oocytes (germinal vesicle stage) associated with either compact (1665 +/- 480 ng/mL.h; 463 +/- 133 ng/L.s; n = 22; P less than 0.02) or expanded (1785 +/- 193 ng/mL.h; 496 +/- 54 ng/L.s; n = 24; P less than 0.005) cumulus mass; a subgroup (n = 5) of follicles with immature oocytes and compact cumulus had very high levels of FF PR, ranging from 3830-7520 ng/mL.h (1064-2089 ng/L.s), while the remainder had levels less than 1300 ng/mL.h (361 ng/L.s). Progesterone and estradiol (E2) were lower in FF surrounding immature oocytes associated with compact (P less than 0.005) or expanded (P less than 0.02) cumulus, than in those containing mature oocytes. Testosterone (T) and androstenedione were measured in only a fraction of the samples; there were no apparent differences between follicles containing mature and immature oocytes. However, T and androstenedione levels were high in the subgroup of follicles containing immature oocytes and very high levels of PR. Of the hormones measured, T revealed the most striking relationship with PR (r = 0.62; n = 49; P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies in women have shown a positive correlation of endogenous estrogen levels with spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion and basal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels. In postmenopausal women, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) by the oral route increases basal and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion but decreases basal IGF-I levels. To assess the corresponding effects of transdermal ERT (tERT) on this axis, we administered four 8-week regimens of transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (Estraderm; 0, 50, 100, or 150 micrograms/day) combined with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg each day) during weeks 3-4 and 7-8 of each 8-week regimen (except placebo) to 28 healthy nonobese postmenopausal women, aged 45.3-71.8 yr. Basal levels of estradiol (E2), GH, and IGF-I as well as GH responsivity to bolus iv administration of GH-releasing hormone-(1-44) (1 micrograms/kg), were measured before tERT and at weeks 6 and 8 of each regimen; estrone (E1) levels were measured before tERT and at week 6 of each regimen. Before tERT, age was inversely correlated with both the peak GH response to GHRH (r = -0.43; P less than 0.02) and basal IGF-I levels (r = -0.37; P less than 0.05), but not with basal E2, E1, or GH levels. There were progressive increases in plasma E2 and E1 levels with increasing doses of tERT (P = 0.0001), independent of age (P greater than 0.2) and body mass index (P greater than 0.2). Mean basal GH and IGF-I levels were not altered significantly by tERT or medroxyprogesterone acetate. Peak and integrated GH secretory responses to exogenous GHRH decreased with increasing tERT dose (P less than 0.01) in both younger and older postmenopausal women. Our findings suggest that the known effects of tERT on bone and other tissues are not mediated via increases in circulating levels of immunoreactive GH or IGF-I, but do not preclude the possibility of tERT-induced increases in the biological activity or paracrine action of IGF-I.\r"

The mother of the twins had normal plasma cholesterol levels, and the father had only moderate hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding studies in cultured fibroblasts and isolated lymphocytes in the parents failed to reveal significantly reduced LDL receptor activity that is typical of FH heterozygotes. Turnover studies of LDL in the parents, however, revealed low fractional clearance rates (FCRs) for LDL. In cultured fibroblasts and isolated lymphocytes from the twin probands, binding of normal LDL was half normal or less. LDL turnover studies in the twins revealed a marked reduction in FCRs for LDL. When the twins were treated with lovastatin, however, FCRs for LDL increased significantly, suggesting enhancement of LDL receptor activity. This finding along with LDL binding studies in the cultured cells infer that the twins did not have homozygous FH. In addition, all family members tested negative for familial defective apolipoprotein-B-100, and LDL isolated from the mother and twins showed normal binding to normal fibroblasts. The overall data suggest that the severe hypercholesterolemia in the offspring was due to inheritance of mild to moderate defects of LDL receptor function from both parents. Although the latter defects could not be detected with certainty by in vitro tests in each parent, they were evident from LDL turnover tests. Coinheritance of these defects apparently produced severe hypercholesterolemia in the offspring.\r"

  ".W": "The close relationship between thyroid microsomal antigen and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is now well established. The present study evaluates the significance of autoantibodies against TPO (anti-TPO-Abs) in the various forms and stages of autoimmune thyroid disease with respect to a possible heterogeneous nature and particularly to their influence on TPO activity. When measured by a RIA using purified human TPO, anti-TPO-Abs were highly correlated with microsomal antibodies determined by enyzme-linked immunosorbant assay (r = 0.96; P less than 0.0001) and with the results of a TPO immunoprecipitation assay using crude microsomal preparations (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001). Relating the results of these assays to the reactivities of patients' sera with thyroid microsomes in immunoblot under nonreducing and reducing conditions, discordant results could be observed in a few cases. Further analysis of these data indicate a heterogeneous nature of anti-TPO-Abs, which react with at least two antigenic domains of the TPO molecule. The comparative analysis of patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease, patients with Graves' disease in clinical remission, and patients with hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis revealed no significant differences in the antibody spectrum. When evaluating the direct influence of anti-TPO-Abs on the activity of TPO under a rigorous methodological approach, we found no significant inhibition of the enzymatic activity by any of the sera investigated from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease compared to that in sera from normal controls. In conclusion, the data indicate a heterogeneous nature of anti-TPO-Abs. The spectrum of antigenic epitopes recognized by anti-TPO-Abs seems not to be significantly different in the various forms and stages of autoimmune thyroid disease. The lack of an inhibitory effect of autoantibodies on TPO activity argues against direct binding of autoantibodies to the enzymatic sites of TPO and indicates that they are not important factors in producing thyroid dysfunction in autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Whether the production of human adrenal androgens is stimulated by a hormone other than ACTH or angiotensin-II has long been controversial. A candidate for such a cortical androgen stimulatory hormone (CASH) is the proximal 18-amino acid hinge region of proopiomelanocortin (POMC). This region of POMC lies to the amino-terminal side of the ACTH region, displays considerable amino acid sequence variation among mammals, and has been reported to stimulate the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) from cultured adult adrenal cells. We cultured human fetal adrenal cells with 10(-8) M CASH-18, 10(-13) M ACTH, 10(-8) M CASH-18 plus 10(-13) M ACTH, 10(-8) M ACTH, or vehicle alone. Culture media were assayed for cortisol, DHEA, and DHEA sulfate, and cellular RNA was assayed for P450scc and P450c17 mRNAs. ACTH (10(-8 M) increased steroid secretion and the mRNAs for P450scc and P450c17, but the other treatments were indistinguishable from the control. Thus, CASH-18 does not affect steroidogenesis in primary cultures of human fetal adrenal cells. These data could be consistent with a model in which adrenarche, the onset of adrenal androgen synthesis at 8-10 yr of age, is mediated by developmentally programmed synthesis of a receptor for CASH. Alternatively, they are also consistent with this region of POMC having no CASH activity.\r"

After a 12-h stabilization period, islets were cultured for 48 h in normal (5.5 mmol/L) or high glucose (16.7 mmol/L) medium. Islets were then perifused to study their insulin response to glucose. Islets cultured in the high glucose medium lost glucose-induced insulin release and, when challenged with an acute fall of glucose concentration in the perifusate, showed a paradoxical insulin release. Insulin release in response to 10 mmol/L L-arginine was preserved in these islets, suggesting a selective reduction of the insulin response to glucose. An additional 48-h culture in 5.5 mmol/L glucose medium partially restored the sensitivity to glucose of the previously unresponsive islets. These findings indicate that short term exposure to high glucose concentrations induces a selective glucose insensitivity of human islets, which can be partially reversed by an additional culture in normal glucose medium.\r"

Thyroid ultrasonography was performed in 1184 consecutive patients attending our clinic, and the echo density of the thyroid parenchyma was evaluated with respect to that of normal thyroid tissue. Diffuse thyroid hypoechogenicity was found in 44 of 238 (18.5%) patients with autoimmune thyroiditis; the degree of hypoechogenicity was significantly correlated with the levels of circulating thyroid autoantibodies. Thyroid function was normal in all 194 patients with normal thyroid echogenicity, whereas hypothyroidism was found in 28 of 44 (63.6%) with reduced thyroid echogenicity. Included in this group were 8 patients, euthyroid at the first observation, who developed hypothyroidism over an 18-month follow-up period. None of the 133 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and normal thyroid echogenicity followed for the same period of time became hypothyroid. Evidence of diffuse lymphocytic thyroiditis was obtained by histology after thyroidectomy (n = 10) or multiple fine needle aspiration cytology (n = 15) in 25 of the 44 patients with thyroid hypoechogenicity; on the other hand, focal thyroiditis was shown at histology in 8 patients who had normal thyroid echogenicity. In conclusion, diffuse low thyroid echogenicity was found in about 20% of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. This echographic pattern is indicative of diffuse autoimmune involvement of the gland and is associated with or may predict the development of hypothyroidism.\r"

Thirty and 60 min after the painful stimulus of the venipuncture, plasma cortisol increased significantly (P less than 0.0005), reaching a maximum increase up to 458 +/- 50, 392 +/- 66, and 455 +/- 97 nmol/L in each age group, respectively. We conclude that in these infants the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was functionally intact and responded to the painful stimulus of the venipuncture by a significant increase in plasma cortisol. This test may be used as a simple procedure for the evaluation of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis without the administration of pharmacological agents. Its usefulness, however, should be validated with patients having a disorder of the system.\r"

  ".W": "A 73-yr-old patient with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was admitted to our hospital in May 1981. The immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) level determined by RIA using antiserum specific for the C-terminal region of PTH-(65-69) was in the upper normal range (0.6 ng/mL) and over the next 7 yr increased gradually to 6 ng/mL. Since iPTH levels determined using other commercial RIA kits remained constantly decreased or in the undetectable range, we studied the mechanism of false elevation of iPTH in this patient. The patient's serum contained no binding protein to the tracer ([125I]) [Tyr45] human PTH-(46-84)), nor was any heterophilic antibody to the first [guinea pig immunoglobulin G (IgG)] or the second antibody (goat IgG) detected. Consistent with these findings, the dilution curve of the serum was parallel with that of standard bovine PTH-(1-84). Gel filtration analysis revealed that the iPTH-like substance was eluted in the void volume (apparent mol wt, greater than 70,000). Almost all of the iPTH-like substance was adsorbod by a protein-A-Sepharose column. When the IgG fraction purified by protein-A-Sepharose affinity chromatography was applied to an antihuman IgG lambda-Sepharose column, 72% of the iPTH-like substance was detected in the IgG lambda. These results suggest that the falsely elevated iPTH in the patient's serum was due to IgGs (mainly IgG lambda), which were cross-reactive with the antiserum highly specific for the C-terminal region of human PTH-(65-69).\r"

As the effects of bisphosphonates on normal bone metabolism are unknown, 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-diphosphonate (APD) was studied in healthy subjects. The effects of a single 20-mg APD infusion on biochemical parameters of calcium and bone metabolism were investigated during 2 months in 10 healthy male volunteers. This single moderate dose of APD reduced biochemical parameters of bone resorption during the time of follow-up. After 2 months, urinary hydroxyproline excretion was still below the basal level. The decreased serum calcium levels did not return to basal values. Biochemical parameters of bone formation, serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, showed a slight increase during the first month after stimulation of the parathyroids and a corresponding increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. These formation parameters decreased thereafter, probably representing coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.\r"

All HHRH patients showed irregular mineralization fronts, markedly elevated osteoid surface and seam width, increased number of osteoid lamellae, and prolonged mineralization lag time. These findings are consistent with a mineralization defect and indicate unambiguously that the bone disease in HHRH is osteomalacia. The only abnormality seen in the asymptomatic hypercalciuric subjects was slightly extended osteoid surface. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses performed on a pooled sample of HHRH patients and asymptomatic hypercalciuric subjects revealed a very high inverse correlation and a tight linear relationship between serum phosphorus and osteoid parameters. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which is low in other forms of hereditary hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia, is elevated in HHRH and correlated positively with osteoid parameters and the mineralization lag time. Serum alkaline phosphatase showed similar relationships. These results as well as the clinical, biochemical, and radiological remission of bone disease consequent to phosphate therapy strongly suggest that in HHRH 1) hypophosphatemia alone is sufficient to cause osteomalacia; and 2) the elevation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D reflects the degree of the primary renal phosphate leak, but is not involved in the pathogenesis of the bone disease.\r"

Recently, it has been reported that an 18-amino acid peptide, corresponding to the first part of the joining peptide of proopiomelanocortin [POMC-(79-96)], was able to stimulate the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone from cultured human adult adrenocortical cells, but had no effect on cortisol production. We have studied the acute and long term effects of ACTH (10(-11) and 10(-9) M), CASH-18 (10(-8) M), or both on cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate by human adult adrenocortical cells. Although ACTH increased steroid secretion and enhanced the steroidogenic responsiveness to further ACTH stimulation, CASH-18 alone or together with ACTH (10(-11) or 10(-9) M) had no effect. In addition, we were unable to demonstrate any specific binding of [125I]CASH-18 to human adrenocortical cells, although [125I] ACTH-(1-39) binds specifically to the same cell preparation.\r"

The present report describes the 24-h profile of plasma GH-BP and its correlation to GH pulsatility in normal individuals. Four normally growing children in early puberty were the subjects of this study. Blood was withdrawn continuously for 24 h in 30-min fractions. Pulse analysis of both GH and GH-BP was performed by the Pulsar program. The vast majority of the GH pulses were accompanied by GH-BP pulses within 30 min. Correlation of plasma GH levels to GH-BP levels on the residual series above the smoothed baseline of all 172 individual samples was r = 0.447 (P less than 0.001). Thus, plasma GH-BP levels fluctuate rapidly in relation to the pulsatility of plasma GH levels. This may influence the GH disappearance rate and brings into question some of the deconvolution calculations of GH secretory impulses.\r"

It is well established that human decidua expresses mRNA for IGFBP-1 and synthesizes and secretes this protein. We now describe, for the first time, that cells morphologically similar to uterine decidual cells found beneath the peritoneal mesothelium in inguinal hernia and in the cervical mucosa during normal pregnancy and in the mesenchymal tissue of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries at term react with the monoclonal antibody for IGFBP-1 equally to endometrial decidual cells. These results imply that the extrauterine mesenchymal cells, which have undergone decidual transformation, are not only morphologically but also functionally, similar to their counterparts in the uterus. Secondly, the data suggest that IGFBP-1 expression is associated with a special type(s) of cells and a certain stage of differentiation rather than special organs in the body.\r"

The stable isotope [9,12,12-2H3]cortisol was infused continuously for 31 h at about 5% of the anticipated FPR. Blood samples were obtained at 20-min intervals for 24 h, spun, and pooled in 4-h groups. Tracer dilution in plasma was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The method was validated with controlled infusions in 6 patients with adrenal insufficiency. Results from 12 normal volunteers revealed a FPR of 27.3 +/- 7.5 mumol/day (9.9 +/- 2.7 mg/day) or 15.7 mumol/day.m2; 5.7 mg/m2. day). A previously unreported circadian variation in FPR was observed. Patients with Cushing's syndrome demonstrated unequivocal elevation of FPR and cortisol concentration correlated during each sample period in normal volunteers, indicating that cortisol secretion, rather than metabolism, is mainly responsible for changes in plasma cortisol. Our data suggest that the FPR in normal subjects may be lower than previously believed.\r"

Serum 3AG (2.7 +/- 2.0 nmol/L) and all androgen concentrations in children with IPA were significantly higher (P less than 0.05-0.001) than those in normal prepubertal children (3AG, 0.8 +/- 0.5 nmol/L). Serum 3AG and androgen levels, except T, in all children with premature pubarche due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency were higher than those in the normal prepubertal children. Serum 3AG and all androgen levels in normal Tanner II-III male (3AG, 3.8 +/- 1.7 nmol/L) or female (3AG, 1.74 +/- 0.52 nmol/L) subjects were also significantly higher (P less than 0.05-0.001) than those in prepubertal children. Serum 3AG, DHEA, DS, and delta 4-A levels in children with IPA were similar to those in normal Tanner II-III females or males, but serum T in children with IPA (0.37 +/- 0.2 nmol/L) was significantly lower (P less than 0.05-0.001) than that in normal pubertal females (0.71 +/- 0.37 nmol/L) or males (4.5 +/- 2.6 nmol/L). In the combined group (n = 88), 3AG levels correlated better with serum DS (r = 0.7), DHEA (r = 0.6), and delta 4-A (r = 0.52), than with T (r = 0.31) levels.

Computer-assisted (deconvolution) analysis was used to determine endogenous GH secretory and clearance rates quantitatively from entire 24-h plasma GH concentration profiles. These analyses revealed that the half-life (t 1/2) of endogenous GH was significantly shorter in obese (11.7 +/- 1.6 min) than in normal weight subjects (15.5 +/- 0.81 min; P less than 0.01). The accelerated blood disposal rate of GH was not due to decreased circulating concentrations of GH-binding protein, since the latter were similar in obese (25 +/- 1.0%) and normal weight (24 +/- 2.3%) men. However, obese men had significantly fewer GH secretory bursts (3.2 +/- 0.53 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.67/day; P less than 0.01). Among the rare GH secretory bursts that occurred in obese subjects, there were significantly prolonged mean intersecretory burst intervals (282 +/- 65 vs. 131 +/- 11 min; P less than 0.05). The resultant daily GH production rate in obese men was reduced to one fourth that in normal weight individuals. Both GH secretion rate and burst frequency were negatively correlated with the degree of obesity (ponderal index). The decreases in GH burst frequency and half-life were specific, since GH secretory pulse amplitude (maximal rate of GH release), the mass of GH released per burst, and the duration of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not different in obese and normal weight men. We conclude that obese men harbor a double defect in GH dynamics involving both GH secretion and clearance, and that the severity of the GH secretory deficiency is proportionate to the degree of obesity.\r"

The E2-sex hormone-binding globulin complex was significantly dissociated by oleate, linoleate, eicosapentaenoate, and palmitate at 1.8 to 2.8-mM concentrations. The same FFA caused a significant increase in E2 binding to albumin at similar concentrations.

We measured iCa hourly and intact PTH every 2 h for 26 h in 25 women (21-69 yr) and 24 men (20-67 yr) consuming self-selected diets. Urine was collected at 0800-1600, 1600-2400, and 2400-0800 h. Serum iCa levels followed a circadian rhythm in both sexes (P less than or equal to 0.01), and the patterns differed between sexes, notably during early morning, when serum iCa levels were lower in women (P = 0.02). Urinary calcium excretion and fractional excretion of calcium declined in both sexes at night (2400-0800 h), but the decline in men was significantly greater (P = 0.02). Similarly, the percent reduction in urinary calcium excretion at night was greater in men than in women (34% vs. 17%; P less than or equal to 0.05). In women, 26-h mean serum iCa values correlated significantly with total daily calcium intake (r = 0.44; P = 0.03). Serum intact PTH levels showed a significant circadian pattern in both sexes (P less than or equal to 0.001). The patterns of serum intact PTH differed between the sexes (P = 0.05), with an earlier and greater increase at night in men. This blunted nocturnal rise in PTH in women may explain the poor nocturnal adaptation to fasting found in women who, despite lower calcium intake, did not reduce urinary calcium loss at night as effectively as men.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the sensitivity of nocturnal GH secretion to different degrees of cholinergic blockade, we investigated the effects of two doses of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (SCOP; 3.0 and 6.0 micrograms/kg, im) and placebo, administered in a randomized fashion at 2300 h on three nights to eight normal male volunteers. Both doses of SCOP produced significant reductions in mean nocturnal GH concentration compared to the effects of the placebo; the higher dose of SCOP reduced GH to a greater degree than the lower dose, but this difference was not statistically significant (mean, 2.3 micrograms/L after 6 micrograms/kg vs. 3.0 micrograms/L after 3 micrograms/kg). Both SCOP doses significantly shifted GH secretion into later portions of the night, with a significantly greater delay observed after the larger dose. Similarly, a significant delay in the time of the GH rise was produced by SCOP. In contrast, the effects of both doses of SCOP on delta-sleep or sleep onset were small. These data confirm earlier reports demonstrating that cholinergic muscarinic input represents a potentially important source of regulation of nocturnal GH release and suggest that the magnitude of the reduction in GH and the extent of delay in the GH rise time may reflect quantitative differences in the degree of cholinergic blockade. These data are in agreement with recent studies suggesting that the timing of GH release need not be associated with delta-sleep per se.\r"

  ".U": "91093394\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms of insulin resistance in obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we examined oxidative and nonoxidative pathways of free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose metabolism in 14 lean and 17 obese (with normal oral glucose tolerance) nondiabetic subjects and in 8 lean and 8 obese subjects with NIDDM. FFA and glucose metabolism were measured using the sequential insulin clamp technique in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3-3H]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate. Obesity was characterized by enlarged fat mass, which correlated positively with the plasma FFA concentration (r = 0.62; P less than 0.01). FFA metabolism was less sensitive to insulin in obese than in lean nondiabetic subjects, but this defect could be overcome by increasing the plasma insulin concentration. NIDDM patients showed normal sensitivity to the inhibitory action of insulin on FFA metabolism; however, maximal suppression by insulin was impaired. The combination of obesity and NIDDM was associated with a further enhancement of reesterification of FFA than observed in either condition alone. In both obesity and NIDDM, the dose-response curve for suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin was impaired. While obesity was primarily characterized by reduced sensitivity to the stimulatory action of insulin on oxidative and nonoxidative pathways of glucose metabolism, resistance to the effect of insulin on glucose metabolism in NIDDM was characterized by a reduced maximal response. The combination of obesity and NIDDM further impaired the sensitivity of liver glucose output and glucose oxidation to insulin. The hypothesis is advanced that in uncomplicated obesity, increased availability and oxidation of FFA leads, by the FFA/glucose cycle, to the impairment in glucose utilization. In NIDDM, on the other hand, the defect in glucose utilization is primary, and the enhanced rate of FFA oxidation may represent a compensatory phenomenon.\r"

This binding almost exclusively resulted from the presence of high numbers of type II oestrogen binding sites. Oestrogen receptors were absent or present at very low concentrations. Immunohistochemical investigation of nuclear oestrogen receptors gave negative results. This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites. The presence of specific type II oestrogen binding sites and progesterone binding offers further evidence for a potential role for these steroids and their receptors in colorectal carcinoma.\r"

The initial diagnoses were chronic active hepatitis in three cases and \"granulomatous cholangitis\", inflammatory pseudotumour, and anaplastic carcinoma in one case each. Moreover, extensive haemorrhagic necrosis in three cases initially suggested the Budd-Chiari syndrome. All the tumours were diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas like the 50 cases reported previously, but they differed from most of these in that nine were of T cell phenotype. Five were pleomorphic small T cell, two T zone, and two T lymphoblastic lymphomas: only one was centrocytic and of B cell lineage. This report extends the range of clinical manifestations (diffuse hepatomegaly without a tumour), histological appearances (resemblance to chronic inflammatory or vascular liver diseases) and phenotype (of T cell lineage) of primary lymphoma of the liver: these features seemed to be related in this series. Recognition is important as prognosis remains favourable in appropriately treated cases. Although the appearances of the liver biopsy specimens may be difficult to interpret, the destructiveness of the infiltrate is an important clue to the diagnosis.\r"

A negative reaction was observed in one Australian case. The intensity of the reaction was strong in seven cases, moderate in one, and weak in three. An equivocal reaction was also noted with probes for types 16 and 18, and types 31, 33, and 35 in two cases from Australia and one from Papua New Guinea. It is concluded that as similar staining patterns and intensities occurred in cases from both areas, the aetiology is the same. The equivocal reactions noted in three cases were probably due to cross hybridisation rather than multiple infection.\r"

The antigen was sought in paraffin wax sections of 43 normal and benign breast biopsy specimens, using the avidin-biotin complex technique, to assess the extent of its presence in non-malignant tissue. Strong focal staining was seen in 21 (49%) cases. In 29 cases of fibrocystic change staining was present in 17 (59%). All areas of apocrine metaplasia were positive, as well as a few normal ducts and acini and occasional areas of adenosis. Focal positivity was present in five out of 12 foci of ductal epithelial hyperplasia and in three out of seven radial scars. Staining was absent in two areas of lobular hyperplasia, three areas of sclerosing adenosis, and in a focus of lactational change. Focal positivity was also seen in two out of five fibroadenomas and in two out of three intraduct papillomas. Five normal subareolar sections and a section of normal lactating breast were negative. It is concluded that B72.3 monoclonal antibody can show focal reactivity with a variety of normal and benign epithelial mammary structures, and it is doubtful that its use would be of any help in differentiating benign from malignant cells in fine needle aspirates.\r"

Their comments were analysed in detail on the following aspects: about how useful and necessary a procedure the necropsy is in medical practice and in education; their personal distaste for the procedure; whether attendance at a necropsy should remain a compulsory part of a medical education; staff attitudes; observance of relatives' wishes; and feelings about necropsies carried out on self or relatives. The data collated from the questionnaire showed that, although students regard the necropsy as useful in clinical practice, a single demonstration does not clarify what its uses are. For some, the necropsy represents disrespect to its subject, and few students seemed aware of the use of the necropsy as an instrument of quality control. It is concluded that the unpleasant aspects of a necropsy demonstration should be kept to a minimum to encourage attendance and promote a sense of its value, and that it might be useful to influence and modify students' opinions before they become entrenched, perhaps by giving a higher priority to training in discussing dying and death in the medical curricula.\r"

Gastric metaplasia was present in the anterior wall duodenal biopsy specimen in 31%, was significantly less common in patients under 17 than in adults, and was more common in males than females. In sixty two adults who underwent multiple radial duodenal biopsy gastric metaplasia was randomly distributed around the duodenal circumference; sixty three per cent of the patients with gastric metaplasia found on multiple biopsy were detected by just the anterior biopsy. Gastric metaplasia was not obviously associated with alcohol, cigarette, or NSAID consumption. While the presence of gastric metaplasia was associated with adulthood, male sex, and low fasting gastric juice pH, its extent was associated with active duodenitis and Helicobacter-associated gastritis. On logistic regression, gastric metaplasia in the duodenum and gastric Helicobacter pylori were independent predictors of active duodenitis, but were not significantly associated with inactive duodenal inflammation. H pylori was observed in duodenal biopsy specimens from 32 patients, all with active duodenitis; bacteria were present only on foci of gastric metaplasia, and were more likely to be seen when the metaplasia was extensive. It is proposed that inflammatory injury to the duodenal mucosa by H pylori may stimulate the development of further gastric metaplasia, and that the area of duodenum susceptible to colonisation with H pylori may therefore increase progressively until mucosal integrity is compromised and ulceration supervenes.\r"

Clinical conditions diagnosed at endoscopy included gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenitis and duodenal ulcer, but half the patients had endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosae. H pylori was detected by one or more of the procedures in at least one specimen from 197 (96.6%) of the patients. Histological and cytological analysis showed equal sensitivity, but bacteriological culture was less reliable. The proportion of positive cases was high, compared with other reported series, which may have been accounted for by the variety of diagnostic techniques used in this study, the selected population (all with gastrointestinal symptoms) or genetic or environmental predisposing factors peculiar to the sample population.\r"

This was achieved by limited proteolysis with protease XIV before immunocytochemical staining. In archival biopsy specimens EBM/11 produced granular cytoplasmic staining of alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, tingible body macrophages and sinus histiocytes, cells of splenic cords, cortical and medullary macrophages of thymus; blood monocytes, peritoneal and mesothelial macrophages; bone marrow mononuclear cells, megakaryocytes and osteoclasts; lamina propria macrophages in the gastrointestinal tract, and connective tissue cells (presumptive macrophages) of thyroid, gall bladder, skin, pancreas, ovary, myometrium, endometrium, cervix, kidney, prostate, placenta, myocardium and breast. Unlike other anti-macrophage antibodies, EBM/11 did not react with granulocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, platelets, endothelial and epithelial cells in paraffin wax sections. It did not label skin Langerhans' cells, microglial cells, and interdigitating reticulum cells (as in frozen sections). This study opens a new area for the specific identification by EBM/11 of mononuclear phagocyte system cells in archival biopsy specimens. It also raises the possibility that some monoclonal antibodies, believed to be reactive only in frozen sections, may react in archival tissue after limited proteolysis with an appropriate enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The antigenic phenotype of human fetal osteoclasts was compared with that of human tissue macrophages and macrophage polykaryons in foreign body lesions using a large number of monoclonal antibodies directed against myeloid (granulocyte/mononuclear phagocyte) antigens. Osteoclasts expressed a restricted range of macrophage-associated antigens including CD13, CD15A, CD44, CD45, CD54, (ICAM-1), CD71 (transferrin receptor), and CD68. These antigens were also present on macrophages and macrophage polykaryons both of which also strongly expressed CD11a,b,c, CD18, (LFA family), CD14, CD31, CD36, CD37, CD39 and CD43 antigens. There was also weak and occasional expression of CD16 (FcRIII), CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor), CD32 (FcRII), CD35 (C3b receptor) and HLA-DR by macrophage polykaryons. The presence of some macrophage associated antigens on osteoclasts is consistent with their originating from cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The numerous differences in antigenic phenotype between osteoclasts and macrophage polykaryons, however, suggest that their pathways of development and differentiation are not identical. The differences discerned in antigenic phenotype should also permit distinction between these polykaryons (and possibly their mononuclear precursors) in normal and diseased tissues.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of dietary alpha-linolenate (18:3n-3)/linoleate (18:2n-6) balance on brain lipid compositions and brightness-discrimination learning ability in aged rats. An alpha-linolenate-rich diet with a peroxidizability index (PI) of 142 and a linoleate-rich diet with a PI value of 80 were used. Long-term feeding of these diets induced a significant difference in the n-3/n-6 ratios of highly unsaturated fatty acids in brain, but the PI values and the conjugated diene contents were similar between the two dietary groups. Rats fed the alpha-linolenate-rich diet had a longer mean survival time and an increased learning ability in senescence. These results contradict an autoxidation-related lipid peroxide theory of aging, and indicate that the aging process must also be considered in terms of n-3/n-6 balance of dietary fats.\r"

Power was measured in situ at 35 degrees C during single and repeated isovelocity shortening contractions through 10% of fiber length at optimum velocity for power. Sustained power was measured during repeated contractions at a stimulation frequency of 150 Hz. The train rate, and consequently the duty cycle, of repeated contractions was incremented every 5 to 10 min until force could not be maintained throughout the shortening contraction. During single contractions, the maximum absolute powers of muscles in young and old mice were 30% lower than that of adult mice, and power normalized by muscle mass (watts/kg) was 20% lower for muscles in old than for those in adult mice (p less than .05). During repeated contractions, EDL muscles in old and adult mice tolerated lower train rates and duty cycles and sustained lower absolute and normalized powers than EDL muscles in young mice.\r"

TRG cells from newborn shrew (0-3 days old), which grew long neurites in an NGF-rich medium, failed to grow any neurites in an NGF-free medium. In contrast, TRG cells from aged shrew (16-19 months), which grew neurites without NGF, exhibited no further increment in neurite length when NGF (50-200 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium. TRG cells from adult shrew (4-5 months) were revealed to be a mixture of NGF-dependent and NGF-independent cells. The NGF-dependent cells (20% of the population) had large-sized somata of 24-32 microns diameter (L-type cells) and 2-7 long neurites enriched with arborizations. The remaining NGF-independent cells (80%) had small-sized somata (15-25 microns, S-type cells), and grew 1-3 neurites with a small number of arborizations. These findings suggest that the primary sensory neuron of the shrew has a cell-type specific critical period in the aging process with respect to the requirement of NGF for neurite promotion.\r"

Histories of treatment for thyroid conditions were present in 13.9% (n = 30) of the population, and test results for an additional 4.3% (n = 8) revealed some hypothyroidism. These subjects were excluded from statistical analysis. Test results revealed significant differences from younger controls as well as skewed distributions for T4, FT4, and TSH. There were no significant correlations with increasing age or gender within the elderly population. 11.8% (n = 21) of the population exhibited elevated TSF levels with normal T4 values, and 23.0% (n = 41) exhibited a titer of one or both thyroid antibodies. Current reference ranges for thyroid tests are broad enough to include the range of values seen in the healthy elderly, but some cautions are discussed.\r"

The effects of aging on the resting activity of muscle sympathetic nerve in supine position at rest (burst number per minute), increase in MSA from the resting level by orthostasis (slope of the regression line between sine of the tilt angle and MSA bursts per minute), and the MSA in upright standing position were analyzed. The resting MSA increased with age, and a significant positive correlation was observed between age and resting activity (Y = -6.83 +/- 0.876X, r = .882, p less than .001). The MSA was enhanced by head-up tilt linearly with the sine of the tilt angle, and a significant negative correlation was observed between age and the MSA increase by orthostasis (Y = 57.6 - 0.582X, r = . 843, p less than .001). Standing MSA increased significantly but less remarkably than resting MSA. It was concluded that aging increases the resting activity, but there is less increase in the standing activity of sympathetic outflow to muscles in humans.\r"

Little is understood about the relationship between menopause, hormonal replacement therapy, and the oral structures, although oral discomfort, xerostomia, and salivary hypofunction have been associated with postmenopausal women. The effects of menopausal status and estrogen therapy on subjective reports of oral dryness and discomfort and objective measurements of major salivary gland output were assessed in 43 healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal females. No complaints of xerostomia or burning mouth and no alterations in the quantity of saliva occurred in this population. This study suggests that among healthy women salivary gland function is not significantly influenced by menopause or hormonal replacement therapy.\r"

Key variables affecting thiamin status were controlled. Weekly dietary intakes, subjective feelings, and activity assessments were measured during a 4-week baseline and 6-week double blind treatment period. Clinical assessments were performed during the last week of each period. For treatment, subjects were randomly assigned to either thiamin (10 mg daily) or placebo groups. Compared to baseline and placebo supplemented values, thiamin-supplemented women experienced significantly increased appetite, energy intake, body weight and general well-being, and decreased fatigue. Thiamin supplementation also tended to reduce daytime sleep time, improve sleep patterns, and increase activity. These data suggest that evaluation of thiamin status is indicated when nonspecific conditions such as anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, depression, and sleep disorders are present in elderly persons.\r"

All subjects were apparently healthy, nondiabetic, and not on a dietary regimen. The associations were studied separately for men and women using linear regression analysis and all possible subsets regression analysis. Among men, body mass index (kg/m2) and intake of monounsaturated fat and of alcohol were positively and consistently associated with serum total cholesterol. Among women, intake of alcohol and of saturated fat were positively associated, and intake of polysaccharides was inversely associated with serum total cholesterol. The intake of monounsaturated fatty acids was highly (r greater than .60) positively correlated with the intake of total fat and saturated fatty acids, and inversely with carbohydrates. HDL-cholesterol was positively associated with alcohol intake (significant for men only), and inversely with body mass index (women). The results indicate that the effect of dietary factors on serum cholesterol levels is probably not age-limited. Elderly people may potentially benefit from weight reduction or control, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoidance of too much dietary fat. These suggestions are in fair accordance with general population-based guidelines for a healthy diet. However, as our study was cross-sectional, causation as well as the public health impact remains to be proven.\r"

In order to gain a better insight into the effect of age on AVP secretion, we evaluated AVP responses to cigarette smoking, MCP, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia in 30 male subjects aged 22-81 and divided into 3 groups by age. Basal AVP concentrations were similar in all groups. The AVP response during the insulin tolerance test had a similar pattern and magnitude (2.5-fold increase) in all groups. AVP responses to MCP and cigarette smoking were similar in the two younger groups, with plasma AVP levels increased 2 times by MCP and 2.5 times by cigarette smoking. In contrast, both MCP- and cigarette smoking-induced AVP rises were significantly higher in the oldest group, where plasma AVP concentrations increased 2.5 times after MCP and 3.25 times after smoking. When data of the MCP and cigarette smoking tests were combined, regression analyses showed a significant positive correlation between AVP peak responses to MCP and cigarette smoking in the oldest subjects. These data show that elderly humans have increased AVP responses not only to MCP but also to cigarette smoking, suggesting a common disorder for both alterations. In contrast, the lack of age-related changes in AVP response during the insulin tolerance test demonstrates that the mechanism underlying the AVP response to hypoglycemia is not affected by aging.\r"

The effect remained strong even when functional disability and health status were controlled statistically. Both pain intensity and number of localized complaints were correlated with GDS and POMS factor scores, but strength and direction of associations varied with level of depression. Item-by-item examination of localized complaints again indicated that more depressed individuals were more likely to report pain, particularly where physicians had identified a physical problem that might account for the pain.

Evidence concerning whether there are reliable age differences on such indicators of implicit memory has been inconsistent.

In a statistically powerful test of this question, indirect and direct tests of memory were administered to 584 adults from three age groups (19-36 years, 55-69 years, 70-86 years). Significant age differences in favor of the young were found on the indirect test as well as direct tests, suggesting that there are small but reliable age differences in implicit memory. Correlational analyses examining the relationship of memory performance to other cognitive variables indicated that the indirect test was supported by different components than the direct tests.\r"

Crystallized intelligence and years of formal education showed little predictive power, but an index of participation in social and domestic activities was a good predictor of verbal, visual, and spatial memory items. It is concluded that cognitive decline in aging involves more than a simple decline in fluid intelligence.\r"

The results confirm previous research pointing out that married people tend to receive assistance from their spouse. Among nonmarrieds, children are named most frequently as the primary caregiver. After children, however, those who live alone tend to receive assistance from friends, and those who live with nonspousal others receive assistance from siblings. The data further document the importance of the structural characteristic of living with someone, rather than marital status, for assistance with IADL.\r"

A primary aim was to analyze the structure of social support networks of the sample in relation to respondents' emotional well-being and met and unmet needs for practical help. The conceptual and methodological framework that was applied to the study was derived from the theory of social networks. In confirmation of the common assumption that people aged 85+ are different from younger elderly people, as they are the \"survivors,\" high levels of social support and informal help were given to most respondents. Although associations were found between social network variables and the provision of informal help, multifactorial analysis showed that health status explained more of the variation in emotional well-being.\r"

Are there any salient differences among regional retirement migrants? Cape Cod, Massachusetts, attracts regional migrants for primarily three reasons: it is a familiar place to most migrants; it is a proximate setting for a variety of amenities; and it is relatively near these migrants' communities of origin, allowing them to maintain ties to previous residences. We argue that a regional move allows migrants to preserve some degree of continuity in their lives that would be impossible had they moved across greater distances, and that the experiences of intrastate migrants illustrate this theme of continuity to a greater extent than those of interstate regional migrants. Our research provides strong evidence that the distance of the move is an important dimension of the migration process for older people and one that can be fruitfully studied on both the macro and micro levels of analysis.\r"

Since World War II, as adolescent suicide rates have risen and elderly suicide rates declined, the rates have generally converged. In particular, adolescent and elderly suicide rates among White males reveal some of the most dramatic shifts relative to other age-race-sex-specific groups. This social-demographic study examined indicators of well-being as proposed by Preston (1984) to determine whether these structural factors can account for White male adolescent and elderly suicide trends. Using annual U.S. suicide rates for the White male populations aged 15 to 24 and 65 and over, I examined the hypotheses that (a) the rising suicide trend among the adolescent population is associated with a deteriorating state of well-being for adolescents, and (b) the generally declining suicide trend among the elderly population is associated with an improving state of well-being for elderly persons. A post-World War II annual time series analysis was used in this research for the period 1946 to 1986. The findings suggest that family dissolution and White children living in poverty are associated with White male adolescent suicide trends and that societal affluence is associated with White male elderly suicide trends. The implications of these findings for future adolescent and elderly suicide trends are also addressed.\r"

Results using linear structural relations analysis showed the effect of a frail elder's health and functioning on personal and interpersonal burden is mediated by task involvement and perceived global stress. Contrary to expectation, there were few differences in the direct effect of each dimension of health, functional limitations, cognitive status, and global health rating on each dimension of burden. Although the results suggested mean differences between spouse and adult child caregivers on key variables, there were no differences by family relationship in the system of relationships that comprise the process linking health and burden.\r"

Prior to beginning omeprazole (40 mg/day), all patients were on H2 antagonists for at least 9 months and still had endoscopic evidence of longitudinal (grade II) or circumferential (grade III) distal esophageal ulceration. Omeprazole therapy brought about complete endoscopic healing in 24 of 25 patients (96%). Twenty-three of 24 healed patients were then restarted on H2 antagonists as maintenance therapy. Repeat endoscopy was performed if symptoms recurred. Fourteen of 24 patients (58%) had recurrence of endoscopic esophagitis documented between 26 and 300 days from the time of starting maintenance therapy. Two of these 14 patients opted for antireflux surgery, whereas the remaining 12 were once again given omeprazole, which again resulted in symptom resolution in all patients. These data suggest that most patients with H2 receptor antagonist-resistant ulcerative esophagitis cannot be successfully maintained on H2 antagonists even after the ulcers have been healed with omeprazole. Further studies are required to determine the role of omeprazole compared to other treatments in the long-term maintenance therapy of these patients.\r"

However, the likelihood of a recurrent ulcer on the posterior wall of the bulb was not significantly different whether the index ulcer was posterior (11 of 36 = 31%) or not (22 of 99 = 22%, p less than 0.24). Three of 20 patients (15%) who initially presented with bleeding bled again with their recurrent ulcers, compared with eight of 115 patients (7%) who first presented with dyspepsia only (p = 0.39). Thirteen patients were assessed independently by two endoscopists to determine ulcer site. Their assessments concurred for 12 (92%).\r"

Since treatment with H2-receptor antagonists has provided symptomatic relief in some reports, we carried out the present study to investigate whether gastric acid is responsible for symptoms in these patients. Fifty patients with essential dyspepsia and 25 healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, a nasogastric tube was passed and its tip positioned in the antrum under fluoroscopic control. Normal saline or 0.1 M hydrochloric acid was infused in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Eleven (22%) patients developed pain with acid infusion, but none with normal saline (p less than 0.005). In 10 of these 11 patients, pain recurred on rechallenge with acid infusion but was promptly relieved with infusion of 1 M sodium bicarbonate. None of the healthy controls developed pain on infusion of acid or saline. These observations suggest that acid has a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptoms in some patients with essential dyspepsia, although other factors may also be important.\r"

In a controlled, randomized prospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness of cimetidine in duodenitis. Statistically significant improvement for the clinical and endoscopic scores was found in 10 patients treated with cimetidine (p less than 0.01). Improvement in the histologic score did not reach statistical significance. No such improvement was demonstrated in seven placebo-treated patients.

We describe two patients with long-standing celiac sprue, one in whom a recurrent sigmoid volvulus developed, and in the other, a cecal volvulus. Following surgery, both are now asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet. The association between celiac sprue and colonic volvulus was first reported in 1953. There have been only a few isolated cases documented, surprisingly so because the two major predisposing conditions for colonic volvulus are often seen in patients with celiac sprue. Colonic bacterial fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrate (in celiac sprue) leads to excess gas production. Flaccid bowel loops with sigmoid redundancy, a long mesentery, or cecal hypermobility are not uncommon. A motility disorder in celiac sprue has also been proposed. Thus these factors together would suggest that the likelihood of development of colonic volvulus in celiac sprue would be relatively great. The possibility of underlying celiac sprue should be considered in patients with colonic volvulus who have a background history of recurrent abdominal distention or malabsorptive symptoms.\r"

For 18 patients with Crohn's disease involving primarily the colon, there was a trend toward a direct correlation between clinical score and ESR (p = 0.15). In the 14 patients with Crohn's disease limited to the colon, this direct correlation was even more pronounced and statistically significant (p less than 0.02). By contrast, an opposite trend was observed for patients with small bowel disease. For the 26 patients with disease involving predominantly the small bowel, as well as for the 22 with disease limited to small bowel, there were statistically significant inverse correlations between clinical score and ESR (p less than 0.04). This difference between the directions of the correlations for Crohn's colitis versus ileitis was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). This study provides further evidence for the importance of analyzing putative indications of disease activity separately for each of the protean forms in which Crohn's disease occurs.\r"

Previous reports have implicated infections, fistulas, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pyoderma gangrenosum, and trauma. Over the past 8 years we have evaluated 10 cases of such refractory parastomal ulcers that occurred at a mean of 11 years after stomal surgery. Eight patients had had an ileostomy for IBD while two had undergone colostomy for colon cancer. Five patients with IBD were diagnosed as having pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerations. They required systemic treatment for a mean of 25 weeks to effect ulcer healing. The other five patients had either parastomal ulcers on the basis of dermatoses (contact dermatitis, eczema, or bullous pemphigoid) or contact ulcers due to face-plate pressure and parastomal dermatitis. These patients received topical treatment with healing of ulcers in a mean of 4 weeks. We conclude that parastomal ulcers occurring in patients without IBD or IBD patients without classic pyoderma gangrenosum require early dermatologic evaluation as they respond relatively quickly to appropriate local therapy.\r"

From a sonographic point of view, the detection of sludge implies the coexistence of small-sized, solid components and of a gel-like embedding material. The chemical nature of biliary sludge has recently been recognized to be predominantly composed of a coaggregate of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and liquid crystalline droplets, and in some cases, such as obstructive jaundice or symptomatic liver diseases, by bilirubin granules, all embedded in a gel matrix of mucous glycoproteins. From a pathogenic point of view, biliary sludge is often associated with biliary stasis, or with conditions characterized by impaired gallbladder contraction, such as prolonged total parenteral nutrition, fasting, and pregnancy. Other causes include mucus hypersecretion, which may favor cholesterol nucleation and crystal growth, and bile infection. Sludge may be an intermediate step in the formation of different types of stones. From an epidemiological point of view, sludge is quite rare in the asymptomatic, free-living population, but may be common in selected series of symptomatic patients. From a clinical point of view, sludge often has a fluctuating course, including frequent disappearances and reappearances, suggesting that the early stages of gallstone formation are reversible.\r"

Persistent chylous ascites may be treated surgically by ligation of leaking lymphatics or implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt once the lymphatic anatomy has been defined by preoperative investigations. We report a case of chylous ascites developing after laparotomy and duodenotomy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not respond adequately to medical therapy and was successfully managed by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt.\r"

The characteristic clinical feature was a recurrent left lower neck abscess which did not respond to appropriate medical and surgical therapy. Radiography and a computed tomographic scan with contrast material revealed a fistula running from the apex of the left pyriform sinus (internal opening) to the left lower neck abscess. The fistula tract was excised surgically. Histological examination of the excised fistula revealed a squamous epithelial lining and subepithelial lymphoid tissue. This pyriform sinus fistula is thought to be of fourth pharyngeal pouch origin, because of its surgical aspects and the histological findings of the excised fistula.\r"

The follow-up period was at least 10 years, or until death or 31 December 1988, comprising a mean duration of 21 (range 6-29) years. The mortality was 11/69 (one lost to follow-up), and was not significantly higher than in a matched 'normal' group. Six deaths were cardiac, four of which could probably be related to the VSD. The follow-up study revealed that: (1) 14 (22%) subjects had major, VSD-related complications, and cardiac surgery was indicated in eight patients; (2) six (10%) had minor complications. By the end of 1988, 24% of subjects had significant dyspnoea, 22% had chest pain and 19% used cardioactive drugs. Only 33% were receiving regular cardiac control in a hospital. Thus unoperated adults with a small VSD should be monitored closely, since this condition is far from benign.\r"

The alcoholic women showed slightly elevated levels of transaminases, but no clinical or laboratory signs of advanced liver damage. These women were characterized by an increased waist-to-hip ratio, due to enlarged waist circumference. Several endocrine abnormalities were found, including irregular or absent menses as well as low oestrogen, progesterone and delta-4-androstendione levels. The concentration of free testosterone was high and that of sex-hormone-binding globulin was low. These data suggest abdominal distribution of body fat, as well as hyperandrogenicity in alcoholic, premenopausal women. It is postulated that the endocrine abnormalities might be responsible for the abdominal fat distribution.\r"

The subjects were categorized as groups 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to the number of stenosed arteries (greater than 75% areal stenosis). Thirty of the patients showed no significant coronary atherosclerosis (group 0). Serum apo B and TC concentrations were directly related to the number of stenosed vessels, whereas the concentrations of apo A and HDLc were negatively correlated with the number of stenosed arteries. An 'atherogenic Index' (ATH index) calculated as the product of serum concentrations of apo B, and TC minus HDLc divided by the product of apo A and HDLc, proved more satisfactory than individual lipoprotein components for discrimination between subjects with and without stenosis. Accordingly, identification of coronary groups may be improved by using the ATH index.\r"

  ".U": "91093669\r", 
  ".W": "In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure. Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups. Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment. A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol. In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively. In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period. We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease.\r"

Following the 1979/80 Tromso Survey, 1373 men, aged 30-54 years, were identified as having high risk for CHD (HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol less than or equal to 17.6% and/or total cholesterol greater than or equal to 7.86 mmol l-1). Of the 1373 men, 911 individuals had wives who also attended the screening. These wives were compared to age-matched, married women in the general population. A significantly higher total cholesterol level (5.98 mmol l-1 vs. 5.78 mmol l-1), lower HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (30.01% vs. 31.58%), higher BMI and higher coronary risk score (4.55 vs. 3.82) was found among the wives of the high-risk men. Furthermore, a higher proportion of these individuals were daily cigarette smokers (47.3% vs. 42.1%), and had received fewer years of education. They also had more dietary habits associated with increased risk of CHD than other married women in the general population. Our findings support the hypothesis that members of the same household as a person with increased risk for CHD also have increased risk. This is most probably due to shared lifestyle.\r"

In this prospective study, verapamil 80-120 mg three times daily was given for 2 months to 20 patients with hypertension, and the effects on calcium homeostasis were recorded. This dose of verapamil significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (+/- SD) from 158/100 +/- 9/8 mmHg to 146/89 +/- 14/8 mmHg (P = 0.001). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased significantly from 2.77 +/- 1.06 mu kat l-1 to 3.19 +/- 1.22 mu kat l-1 (P = 0.004), and isoenzymes of ALP of skeletal origin appeared after verapamil treatment. The excretion of sodium in the urine increased (Na/creatinine ratio 8.95 +/- 6.01 before and 13.16 +/- 8.26 after verapamil; P = 0.04), while the excretion of calcium, phosphate and potassium was not changed. PTH was slightly increased at the end of verapamil treatment (1.09 +/- 0.54 vs. 0.98 +/- 0.74 microgram l-1; P = 0.07), and s-1,25(OH)2D3 was also somewhat increased (22.3 +/- 14.4 vs. 17.6 +/- 4.9 ng l-1; P = 0.26). Serum Ca was not affected by verapamil (before verapamil 2.43 +/- 0.11 mmol l-1, after verapamil 2.40 +/- 0.12 mmol l-1; P = 0.28). The increase in serum ALP demonstrates that verapamil affects bone cell metabolism in man. This effect could be secondary to the enhancement of PTH secretion.\r"

The major causes of death are cardiovascular, whereas end-stage renal failure is of low frequency. To define kidney function and the presence of some assumed cardiovascular risk factors, we compared a group of 19 microalbuminuric NIDDM patients (M), of mean age (+/- SD) 65 +/- 4 years, and known duration of diabetes 8 +/- 7 years, with 19 randomly selected matched normoalbuminuric patients (N). Seven microalbuminuric patients (P) were also studied. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not differ between N and M, whereas kidney volume was increased in M (260.3 +/- 54.1 ml 1.73 m-2) compared to N (220.4 +/- 44.8 ml 1.73 m-2; P = 0.018). The frequency of cardiac disease increased with increasing albuminuria. Glycaemic control did not differ between the groups, but fasting plasma C-peptide levels increased from 2.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms l-1 in N, to 3.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms l-1 in M (P = 0.08), and to 4.2 +/- 1.9 micrograms l-1 (P = 0.03) in P. The lipoprotein profile showed no significant differences, although the LDLcholesterol/HDLcholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio tended to rise. A significant correlation was found between C-peptide and LDL-C/HDL-C (r = 0.5; P less than 10(-3]. In conclusion, GFR was not increased, and did not differ between N and M, whereas kidney volume was enhanced in M. Several assumed cardiovascular risk factors showed values of M intermediate between those of N and P.\r"

There were 61 cases of leucopenia (of which 16 had agranulocytosis), 28 cases of thrombocytopenia, and two of non-haemolytic anaemia. There were also 32 cases of bicytopenia and 31 cases of tricytopenia. The median age varied from 38 years in the leucopenia group to 81 years in those with tricytopenia. The overall fatality rate was 17%, ranging from 2% in the group with mild leucopenia to 52% in the group with tricytopenia. In relation to sales and prescription data, the overall incidence of reported T-SM blood dyscrasias was 5.3 per million defined daily doses, and among out-patients the incidence was one case per 18,000 prescriptions. Thus the overall incidence of any blood reaction to T-SM appears to be low. In relation to prescription data, elderly people were overrepresented among the serious reactions.\r"

'Definite' or 'probable' drug events accounted for 15 admissions (4.1%, 95% confidence limits 2.3-6.7%), of which eleven were ADR and four were DTF. With the inclusion of six 'possible' drug events, the rate of drug-related hospitalizations (DRH) was 5.7%. DRHs were characterized by a preponderance of acute admissions and elderly patients. Hypokalaemia (less than 3.5 mM) was observed in 27 (16%) patients receiving diuretics, and could be related to four cases of arrhythmias (two 'probable' and two 'possible' ADR). The average serum potassium level was similar in diuretic treated patients with or without drugs to counteract hypokalaemia, irrespective of the drugs chosen. Among the 15 'definite'/'probable' DRHs, five were considered to be due to an error in prescription, and a further five cases were judged to have been avoidable had appropriate measures been taken by prescribing physicians. A DRH educational intervention programme should primarily deal with non-compliance or with prescription of diuretics or digoxin, since these problems constitute the majority of cases of DRH. No specific group of doctors could be targeted as responsible for DRH, avoidable or not.\r"

In univariate analyses the waist/hip circumference ratio (WHR), body fat and lean body mass were all positively associated, and SHBG levels were negatively associated with insulin and glucose values. Muscle fibre areas were positively correlated with insulin but not with glucose concentrations. Adjustment for other variables did not remove the positive association between WHR and fasting insulin and glucose concentrations. SHBG, free testosterone and type IIb fibre areas were, however, significant confounding factors in the relationship between WHR and summed insulin and glucose concentrations. We conclude that fat distribution in obese women is associated with fasting hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, independently of androgens and muscle fibre morphology, but that reduced SHBG concentrations and increased type IIb fibre areas may partly explain increased glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load in abdominally obese women.\r"

  ".W": "Renal reserve filtration capacity (RRFC) was investigated in 20 kidney donors before and within 3 months after uninephrectomy. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by the clearance of 125I-iothalamate, and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was determined by the clearance of 131I-hippurate. RRFC was tested by infusion of a low dose of dopamine, by intravenous administration of an amino acid solution and, finally, by combined infusion of amino acids and low-dose dopamine. After kidney donation, the median value of the GFR was 65% of its initial value. The median value of the ERPF was 69% of its value before uninephrectomy. The filtration fraction declined significantly from 0.251 to 0.238 (medians; P less than 0.02). Median values for dopamine-induced increases in GFR were 13.8% before and 5.3% after kidney donation (P less than 0.005). Infusion of amino acids led to an increase in GFR of 11.2% before and 9.6% after donation (NS). During combined infusion, the median values for the increases in GFR were 20.0% before and 12.6% after uninephrectomy (P less than 0.02). Median changes in ERPF before and after kidney donation were 33.4 vs. 23.0% during dopamine infusion (P less than 0.005), 10.0 vs. 8.3% during amino acid infusion (NS), and 36.2 vs. 24.3% during the combined infusion of dopamine and amino acids (P less than 0.02). Infusion of dopamine induces a decrease in renal vascular resistance, resulting in a rise in glomerular blood flow. Since RRFC tested by means of dopamine infusion was significantly decreased after kidney donation, it is concluded that glomerular hyperfiltration after kidney donation is at least partially due to a rise in glomerular blood flow.\r"

It is important to identify the secondary hyperparathyroidism of coeliac disease as a cause of multiple hot spots in skeletal scintigraphy--the finding resembles malignancy, but is due to a benign, curable condition.\r"

Prior to the administration of thalidomide, the patient had been treated for 7 weeks with full parenteral nutrition and high doses of steroids intravenously without a satisfactory effect on the colitis. Treatment with sulphasalazin was unsuccessful because of a decreasing number of platelets on this drug. After a few days on thalidomide, 300 mg given once daily at bedtime, the patient's stools were normalized and without reaction for blood, his oral ulcers and pleural effusion disappeared, and his steroid doses could be reduced. Gradually he was put on oral nutrition again, and his rectal mucosa became normalized. The dose of thalidomide was reduced to 200 mg, and then to 100 mg daily when the patient was discharged from hospital, less than 3 weeks after institution of the drug treatment. After 5 months as an out-patient his condition is still satisfactory and without symptoms of his former disease. Thalidomide has previously been reported to be of value in treatment of Behcet's syndrome, but to my knowledge never with such a dramatic effect on a severe colitis as reported in this case.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, community-based study of 675 consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke, of whom over 90% had computed tomography (CT) and/or necropsy examinations, 129 deaths occurred within 30 days of the onset of symptoms, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%. The 30 day CFR for patients with cerebral infarction was 10% (57 of 545, for primary intracerebral haemorrhage 52% (34 of 66), for subarachnoid haemorrhage 45% (15 of 33) and for those of uncertain pathological type 74% (23 of 31). The CFR for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 33% compared with 17% for those who had been independent pre-stroke. The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was not significantly greater (1.8, 95% confidence interval 0 to 4.3). There was a significant trend for CFR to increase with age (Chi square for trend = 4.0, p less than 0.05). This relationship was found in those patients who had been functionally independent prestroke (Chi square for trend = 7.9, p less than 0.005) but not in those who had been dependent pre-stroke (Chi square for trend = 0.5, NS). The pattern of increasing CFR with increasing age amongst those who had been independent prestroke was seen particularly in patients with cerebral infarction (Chi square for trend = 8.6, p less than 0.005). The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients with cerebral infarction who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.1). Fifty three percent of all deaths within 30 days of stroke were due to the direct neurological sequelae of the stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified. In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year. Nineteen patients died within the study period. Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease. This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease). Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed.\r"

The prognosis of this group was excellent with the exception of a small subgroup (7%), largely identifiable because of atypically brief or recurrent attacks, who developed epilepsy of temporal lobe type on follow up. Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack.\r"

Post treatment, 58% (15/26) of the N20 and P25 latencies were prolonged in the affected hemispheres; 8% (2/26) were shortened; and 35% (9/26) did not change. The mean N20 and P25 latencies were significantly prolonged two hours post treatment in the affected hemisphere (N20, P less than 0.01, P25 P less than 0.01). Nicardipine (Ni) had no effect on SEP components in the intact hemispheres. Seventy five per cent of the 12 patients with hypertension had a decrease in blood pressure (BP) after taking nicardipine, but there were no undesirable side effects or worsening of neurological signs. Our study demonstrates that nicardipine prolongs the latencies of short-latency components of SEP in the affected hemisphere after acute ischaemic stroke and also decreases BP. These observations suggest that nicardipine therapy might impair neuronal function in the ischaemic zone.\r"

Experiments were designed to test whether hypoglycaemia induced with insulin is associated with improved behavioural outcome in a recovery model of stroke. Rats learned a maze task as a test of working memory, believed to be subserved by the hippocampus, and then had a period of cerebral ischaemia, followed by reperfusion. After an interval of 14 days they were tested on the same maze, where lesioned animals had very significant (p less than 0.0001) impairment of working memory, whereas lesioned and treated (2.0 u/kg-1 insulin, minimum single plasma glucose value: 3.1 mmol/l-1) animals were indistinguishable from control animals. It is concluded that a striking degree of protection can be obtained with levels of mild hypoglycaemia which may be acceptable and practicable for use in humans.\r"

Loss of neurons from the superior frontal gyrus and shrinkage of neurons from both the superior frontal gyrus and motor cortex has been documented in chronic alcoholic patients; these areas were chosen for this study. Using a modified rapid Golgi technique the basal dendritic arborisation of layer III pyramidal neurons was compared in 15 male alcoholic patients and 15 age-matched male controls. All parameters measuring basal dendritic arborisation were significantly less in the alcoholic cases for both the superior frontal and motor cortices. Changes in the arbor are in the terminal branches, which is consistent with other models of dendritic plasticity. Such changes may explain both permanent and reversible functional deficits in chronic alcoholic patients.\r"

The experiment examined the ability of PD patients to vary the duration of their movement (four different percentages of their maximum) under conditions where temporal, but not spatial, control was emphasised. PD patients had longer movement times than control subjects, but were able to vary the duration of their movement with comparable temporal accuracy to that of elderly subjects. For both groups, the agonist EMG activity increased with decreased movement duration. For the PD patients, the number of agonist bursts increased with increased movement duration.\r"

Depressed patients showed a significantly higher frequency of both autonomic and affective symptoms of depression. Depressed patients with PD reported a significantly higher frequency of worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, suicidal tendencies, social withdrawal, self-depreciation, ideas of reference, anxiety symptoms, loss of appetite, initial and middle insomnia, and loss of libido when compared with non-depressed patients. No significant between-group differences, however, were observed in the frequency of anergia, motor retardation, and early morning awakening.\r"
