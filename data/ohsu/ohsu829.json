To study today's private practice environment, we took a survey. Questionnaires were sent to the chiefs of surgery and the nurse managers of the surgical intensive care units at 188 non-university-affiliated hospitals throughout the United States. Results show that surgeons do not have the principal managing role in the intensive care unit for surgical patients in 70% to 75% of the hospitals. Results also indicated that surgeons are relinquishing their responsibilities in the direct care of the preoperative and postoperative critically ill patients. Three main reasons are given for this: (1) an ever-increasing body of critical care knowledge plus complex technology, (2) a lack of economic incentive, and (3) professional liability. To reverse this trend, these three areas must be addressed.\r"

Operations done more than 6 hours after admission had a higher complication rate (45%) than those done less than 6 hours after admission (18%). Penrose drainage without a sump was not associated with increased complications. Distal pancreatectomy was done 32 times; splenectomy was done in only 18 patients. Individual duct ligation was rarely done and did not result in a high fistula rate. Pancreatic stump oversew with nonabsorbable suture was associated with a higher rate of pancreatic complications than absorbable suture (58% vs 30%). Only 56% of patients receiving distal pancreatectomy required hyperalimentation. Postoperative serum amylase values were not useful, and amylase values from drainage fluid predicted complications only when they were above 100,000 U/L. Details of pancreatic trauma management are less important than early operation in minimizing morbidity.\r"

Ninety-five percent of survivors recovered their white blood cell count above 1.0 x 10(9)/L, while 70% of nonsurvivors did not. No symptom or sign was found to be pivotal in the decision for or against surgical intervention. Overall, 60% of the patients in this series died. Thirty-four percent of patients underwent a surgical procedure, the majority of whom survived.

During the 5-year period of observation, cardiac disease led to death in 17 of the 8342 live births in Olmsted County. Cardiac disease also caused the deaths of 248 adults meeting the age criteria. Five children and 35 adults met all criteria for cardiac replacement. Extrapolation to the total population of the United States suggests that 2167 children (a 95% confidence interval of 361 to 3972) and 16,500 adults (a 95% confidence interval of 11,456 to 22,959) per year could potentially benefit from cardiac replacement.\r"

The dysphagia grade was improved overall but depended on the site of the tumor. All bleeding lesions were successfully photocoagulated. Twelve colorectal malignant neoplasms were treated palliatively, six for obstruction (three intraperitoneal colon and three rectal) and six for bleeding (three intraperitoneal and three rectal). The mean number of treatments for the group was 1.5, and the overall survival ranged from 2 to 38 months, with a median survival of 15 months.

The mean (+/- SD) level of mIL-1 produced by adherent cells to ePTFE significantly decreased from day 2 (13,746 +/- 3630 cpm per disk) compared with day 7 (2828 +/- 1304 cpm per disk). However, the level of mIL-1 produced by ePTFE-adherent cells was still markedly greater than the level of mIL-1 produced by cells adherent to SE (1877 +/- 1028 vs 1595 +/- 822 cpm per disk). These results indicate that ePTFE and SE elicit a differential host response in terms of cytokine production. This study may enhance our understanding of the cellular events on the surface of biomaterials that underlie clinical observations.\r"

Thirty-one patients (62%) presented with a high-grade tumor, 37 patients (74%) with a tumor larger than 5 cm, and 12 patients (24%) with metastasis. The median survival of the whole group was 33 months, and the median survival of patients who underwent curative operation was 174 months. Nineteen of 32 patients who underwent curative operation were observed to develop distant metastasis after 3 to 209 months. The dominant sites of metastatic disease were the liver and peritoneal cavity. In a multivariable analysis, noncurative treatment and high-grade tumor were the only prognostic factors unfavorably affecting tumor-related mortality. If the type of treatment received was not considered, presentation with metastatic disease and a high-grade tumor were the two unfavorable characteristics that had independent prognostic value. Patients with a tumor that was larger than 5 cm or that was located in the colon had a greater likelihood of having a palliative procedure or high-grade tumor.\r"

We performed such hepatic subsegmentectomies in nine cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. With the sacrifice of the right hepatic vein, S7, S8 resection was done in three patients, S7 resection in two patients, S8 resection in one patient, and S5 resection in one patient. With the sacrifice of the middle hepatic vein, S8 resection was done in two patients. These resections were successfully performed with no postoperative problem. Further, there were no significant differences in postoperative liver function tests of the patients from those of a control group of the commonly performed systematic segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy. By performing such resections, resection was made possible in three cases and curative resection was made feasible in six cases.\r"

Island pedicle flaps were raised on the buttock of 24 adult ewes and multiply inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Flaps with bacterial inoculation, without compromise of venous outflow, showed distal necrosis (mean +/- SEM percent of surface area, 25.8% +/- 8.6%) and developed septic foci with bacterial counts one log less than the amount injected. Flaps with inoculation and venous outflow obstruction underwent subtotal necrosis (mean percent of surface area, 73.3% +/- 11.2%) and had counts two logs higher than the nonobstructed flaps but without discrete septic foci. Flaps without inoculation, with or without venous obstruction, survived completely. Venous outflow obstruction is shown herein to potentiate tissue necrosis by raising bacterial counts in a septic focus and preventing defensive abscess formation by the host.\r"

For this reason, it is generally considered that its presence should be an indication for surgery. In the present study 20 patients with pneumopericardium were selected for conservative treatment. All patients were closely observed by means of clinical examination, serial chest roentgenography, electrocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography. In five patients the electrocardiogram showed pericarditis, and in three patients the echocardiogram demonstrated small pericardial effusions. One patient developed tension pneumopericardium 36 hours after admission and required surgical intervention. The remaining 19 patients had an uneventful recovery. We suggest that the presence of a pneumopericardium following penetrating chest trauma is not an absolute indication for surgery. Electrocardiographic and echographic studies may help in the selection of patients for conservative treatment; but the final decision should be made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms.\r"

Cholecystectomy was performed and prompt relief of symptoms was achieved in all patients; no postoperative complication was observed. One patient did not develop any recurrence during an 18-month period of follow-up; two patients died 2 and 3 months after the operation. One patient developed recurrent abdominal pain and cholestasis 4 months after the operation, with dilatation of the common bile duct and papillary stenosis due to progression of cholangitis. These observations suggest that cholangitis is frequently associated with cholecystitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Its pathogenesis is not known.\r"

A preliminary venacavogram was performed through the carrier or a previously placed angiographic catheter. Two complications were encountered: the first was misplacement of a filter in the right renal vein before routine venacavography was employed; the second was caudal displacement of a filter by a right atrial venous drainage cannula that projected into the inferior vena cava. The latter complication can be prevented by the use of a right atrial \"sump\" drain that does not protrude into the inferior vena cava.\r"

Improvement of early retinopathy has not been recognized as a part of the natural course. In our experience, 25% of observations in subjects with early diabetic retinopathy (grades 2 and 3) showed improvement. Thus, 28 of 174 observations of diabetic retinopathy improved from grade 2 to grade 1, and 34 of 79 observations improved from grade 3 to grades 2 or 1. Markov chains indicate that 25% of observations of diabetic retinopathy will change from grade 1 to grade 5 or 6 in 17.0 years and 25% will change from grade 2 to grade 5 or 6 in 16.0 years. Future studies of diabetic retinopathy should consider a matrix of estimated transition probabilities, depending on the population, to judge probabilities of transition between states of retinopathy.\r"

To evaluate the effect of constitutional factors and UV radiation on the risk of uveal melanoma, 197 cases in New England were compared with 385 matched population controls, identified by random-digit dialing, and 337 cases residing within the United States were compared with 800 sibling controls. In the population-based comparison, estimated relative risks (RRs) of uveal melanoma, after adjustment for other factors, were elevated for the following: ancestry from more northern latitudes with a substantially elevated risk for Northern European ancestry (RR, 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 22.4) and more than a twofold risk for British ancestry (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.1), as compared with Southern European or other Mediterranean heritage; light skin color as compared with dark (RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 12.6); and 10 or more cutaneous nevi as compared with none (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.9). There was a statistically significant trend for increasing risk with more northern heritage and more moles. Southern residence (below latitude 40 degrees N) for more than 5 years also increased risk (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.9), as compared with none. In both comparisons, use of sunlamps was a risk determinant (RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 10.3 with random-digit dialed controls and RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3 with sibling controls, comparing occasional or frequent use to never use), as was intense sun exposure (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.0 and RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2, respectively). However, birthplace below latitude 40 degrees N and outdoor work were associated with a lower risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All eyes were examined monthly for refractive alteration and clinical appearance during a follow-up period of 7 to 33 months. The refractive yield was measured by retinoscopy and found to be a function of the implant depth. The mean +/- SD percent of the desired correction achieved averaged 70% +/- 24% at a 36% to 60% depth (n = 8), 54% +/- 22% at a 61% to 79% depth (n = 7), and 12% +/- 14% in implants deeper than at a 79% depth (n = 9). For eyes with implants at a 36% to 60% depth, the predicted vs achieved refractive alteration yielded a correlation coefficient of .97 (88% within +/- 3 diopters of the correlation). The refractive outcome remained stable throughout 7 months of follow-up, whereas deeply placed lenses (greater than or equal to 80%) exhibited significant regression in power during this time.\r"

  ".U": "90379886\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which optic nerve sheath fenestration relieves papilledema associated with increased intracranial pressure has not been clearly defined. A model was constructed to determine if the induction of fluid flow along the nerve sheath and through the fenestration could account for a reduction in pressure around the optic nerve, as might be expected according to Bernoulli's equation of fluid dynamics. The model states that as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure it exerts decreases. The model simulated fluid spaces corresponding to the intracranial vault, chiasm, and optic nerves. The unfenestrated model showed direct transmission of elevated intracranial pressure to the nerves, consistent with the production of papilledema. When one nerve was fenestrated, fluid flow along the nerve was initiated and pressure in that nerve sheath dropped substantially. In addition, pressure in the unfenestrated sheath dropped due to fluid communication across the chiasm. These lower intrasheath pressures were consistent with the bilateral resolution of papilledema after unilateral fenestration. The reduced intrasheath pressures persisted even when the intracranial pressure was again elevated to pathologic levels as long as active fluid flow continued along the nerve sheaths. Thus, induction of cerebrospinal fluid flow along the optic nerve sheath by fenestration appears to locally reduce the pressure around the optic nerve, in spite of persistently elevated intracranial pressure. This is in accordance with what would be predicted by Bernoulli's equation.\r"

There were three perioperative deaths, and the postoperative morbidity rate was low. The facial nerve was preserved anatomically in 82% of patients. Preoperative facial weakness and tumor size larger than 2.5 cm were predictive of poor facial recovery. In patients with an intact nerve but complete facial palsy 1 week after surgery, electroneuronography was a good predictor of the final facial outcome and may influence the timing of rehabilitative procedures. With the exception of patients who have small tumors and good speech discrimination (where a suboccipital approach may preserve hearing acuity), the translabyrinthine operation is the procedure of choice for removal of acoustic neurinomas in patients who have normal hearing in the contralateral ear.\r"

  ".W": "The brachial plexus tension test (BPTT) appears to offer a means of examining the extensibility and mechanosensitivity of the neural tissues related to an upper limb. This test was used to evaluate possible cervical or brachial plexus neural involvement causing arm pain syndromes in 37 patients presenting for assessment following neck injury in motor vehicle accidents. The BPTT was considered positive in 55 of the 61 symptomatic arms. There were no false-positive responses in the 13 asymptomatic arms although a slight loss of extensibility was evident in five arms. Twenty patients without clinical evidence of current or previous neck pathology were similarly examined. There were no reports of pain on BPTT in this group. In 36 of the 40 arms a full range of extensibility was present. In the other four arms the loss of extensibility was slight. This study suggests that arm pain and paraesthesiae which follow neck injury in motor vehicle accidents arise from irritable cervical neural tissues. The study also highlights the persistent nature and widespread distribution of the pain in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty eyes of 30 patients underwent tight scleral flap trabeculectomy. Of these eyes, 22 underwent laser lysis of the scleral flap sutures, whereas eight eyes did not require such treatment because of low intraocular pressure and active filtering blebs. In the 22 eyes treated, preoperative intraocular pressure was 32.6 +/- 8.3 mm Hg, whereas postoperative and pre-laser intraocular pressure was 29.3 +/- 7.4 mm Hg. Immediately after laser suture lysis, intraocular pressure dropped by 22.7 +/- 9.4 mm Hg (P less than .01) to 6.6 +/- 7.0 mm Hg, with elevation of the conjunctival bleb in all eyes treated. After a mean follow-up of 14.4 months, intraocular pressure was controlled (less than or equal to 18 mm Hg) in 20 of the 22 eyes treated (91%). The only major complication was a single case of anterior chamber flattening with intraocular lens touching the corneal endothelium. Combination of tight scleral flap trabeculectomy with subsequent postoperative laser suture lysis is a safe and effective method for low-level intraocular pressure control. This technique seems to combine the advantages of full-thickness filtration and trabeculectomy by achieving relatively low intraocular pressures while minimizing complications caused by excessive aqueous runoff.\r"

D4 latency was significantly longer than controls more often than digit 2 (D2) in patients with CTS. Comparing median to ulnar latencies from D4 was the most sensitive method to make the diagnosis of CTS. In mild CTS, a characteristic double peak potential was seen in recordings from the median nerve after stimulating D4. This potential provided immediate visual confirmation of the diagnosis of CTS. Comparing D4 latency along median and ulnar nerves is useful for detecting mild CTS and should be used whenever there are clinical signs and symptoms of CTS but electrodiagnostic studies are normal or borderline.\r"

  ".W": "Research must investigate the three overlapping areas of continuing medical education: it must discover and document what, how, and why physicians learn and change; how better programs of education can be designed to fit into this process; and in what ways the organizations that provide CME can or should differ in their policies, procedures, and resources. In terms of physician learning, for example, the basic assumption must be that physicians are like other adults in the general ways they learn in voluntary settings, yet have specific differences from other professional groups and from their physician colleagues in other specialties. Making the changes necessary for informed medical practice depends on understanding the role of learning in changes--which in turn depends on CME research. But barriers hinder much-needed research: conducting CME research is seldom rewarded in medical centers; CME is usually not a highly valued component of the institution; funding sources are few and support is limited; and persistent debate over the relative merits of qualitative and quantitative methods diverts energy that should be going into productive, cooperative research. The urgency of needed changes in medical practice and organization may give the necessary impetus for interdisciplinary, collaborative CME research projects that will take a longer-term view of the effect of learning on physician change.\r"

This paper describes a seminar for premedical students aimed at preventing their later disillusionment and distress as medical trainees by fostering realistic expectations and emotional exploration. The seminar consists of open-ended discussions between premedical students and medical trainees/practitioners about stress and coping at various career stages, a physician preceptor for each student, and emotionally expressive readings and videotapes. Course-end and follow-up evaluations found that both the students' realism about their careers and their personal well-being were markedly increased.\r"

The data show that the minority students entered medical school with some distinct advantages over the white students. The minority students reported greater social supports, higher self-esteem, lower anxiety, and more internal locus of control. After one year, however, the blacks manifested slightly lower self-esteem and higher levels of hostility and external locus of control. The Hispanics continued to report higher self-esteem and greater social supports but showed increased external locus of control and higher alcohol consumption. Policy implications for improvements in pre-entrance enrichment programs are discussed.\r"

Health status, quantitated in terms of Duke Health Profile scores, was generally lower for women than for men. Although there was a definite trend of worsening along all parameters of health and satisfaction during the year for both women and men, the most marked change was the increase in depressive symptoms. The students who were very satisfied with life had fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety; higher self-esteem, better physical, mental, and social health; stronger social ties; more physical activity; more sleep; and fewer stressful life events. Strong social ties was the factor most positively related to better health and life satisfaction.\r"

The authors hypothesized that (1) more of the women would be seen for psychiatric consultation; (2) overall, the problems and diagnoses of the students would differ according to gender and academic class; (3) the women would show more evidence of role strain; (4) the women would remain in treatment longer; and (5) for all students, the average length of treatment would be relatively brief. The results of this study indicate that more of the women requested psychiatric consultation; that differences along gender lines regarding chief complaints and psychiatric diagnoses were not significant; and that the women revealed more direct and subtle evidence of role strain but did not remain in treatment longer than the men. The date are discussed in terms of the development and implementation of educational programs that attempt to prevent some of the psychiatric impairments of physicians.\r"

Couples may also have to deal with the relative intimacy that often develops between students and their colleagues who function in close, often stressful settings and who tend to rely on each other for emotional and intellectual support. The variety of these challenges has increased as student bodies have become more heterogeneous in age, gender ratio, and cultural background. Medical schools can help couples cope with these challenges by developing policies and programs responsive to the needs of couples and by providing opportunities for partners' involvement in the institutional life of students.\r"

Some social scientists, however, question the view that demanding careers are the primary cause of poor marital adjustment and suggest instead that such careers may actually invigorate a marriage. This study, involving 116 housestaff physicians, 106 new attorneys, and the spouses of both groups, identified the factors that significantly affected their marital adjustments. No difference in marital adjustments was found between housestaff and attorneys or between the two spouse groups. In general, the spouses had higher marital adjustment scores than did the professionals, and the women professionals had higher scores than did the men professionals. The two most important factors associated with adjustment were the perceived level of emotional support received from one's spouse for one's career and the level of such support given to one's spouse for his or her career. The results suggest that housestaff and new attorneys are as satisfied with their marriages as are the other populations in which the same marital inventory has been used.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined how satisfied patients and residents were before and after the restructuring of the general medicine clinic at a large urban teaching hospital in 1985; the change to a longitudinal care clinic was made to provide greater continuity of care, more consistent access of residents to attending physicians, and a more structured educational curriculum. Questionnaires to assess satisfaction were administered three weeks before and ten months after the change to all 80 of the second- and third-year residents. A convenience sample of 310 patients seen during a two-week period before the change and another such sample of 267 patients seen during a two-week period ten months after the change comprised the patients who completed a patients' satisfaction questionnaire. The residents were significantly more satisfied with the quality of care, functioning, and educational value of the new longitudinal care clinic. Their average overall rating of satisfaction (on a scale where 1 = completely dissatisfied and 5 = completely satisfied) increased from 2.3 to 3.7 (p less than .001). Unexpectedly, the patients were \"very satisfied\" with both clinic models and their overall ratings changed little (4.5 before, 4.4 after). In addition, the patients' and residents' before-and-after perceptions of the quality of care delivered in the clinic differed substantially. These findings show that the longitudinal care clinic significantly enhanced the satisfaction of the residents but not of the patients. Furthermore, the data suggest that results from standardized patients' satisfaction surveys may not accurately assess the quality of care being delivered.\r"

Our aim was to determine whether this abnormality reflects defective hemidesmosome synthesis in vitro. Keratinocytes from five JEB patients were cultured under standard conditions. Control cultures, from four healthy males, three patients with dystrophic EB (DEB), and one patient with the simplex variant (EBS), were also examined. Post-confluent cultures were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Hemidesmosome-like structures were counted in electron micrograph montages. The number of hemidesmosome-like structures in JEB cultures (0.97 +/- 0.57, per 10 microns of basal cell membrane) was approximately 17% of the value for normal controls (5.81 +/- 3.08, P less than 0.02). The values for EBS (3.72) and DEB (3.28 +/- 1.44) were not statistically different from normal controls. In addition hemidesmosome-like structures in JEB cultures were morphologically ill-defined, compared with those from controls. This correlated with the loose apposition between JEB keratinocytes and the substrate, which appeared tight in controls. JEB keratinocytes continue to express in vitro a major phenotypic abnormality which characterizes the disease in vivo. Therefore, this model should prove useful in studies determining the pathogenesis and possible new treatments of JEB.\r"

Foreskin HuMC were cultured in a hormone-supplemented system not dependent on the presence of phorbol esters. Following addition of alpha-MSH (10(-6) M) there was a rise in cAMP levels maximal between 5 and 15 min to 9.4 +/- 3.2 pM/10(5) cells, while control levels were 3.6 +/- 0.7 pM/10(5) cells. After 7 days' culture in the presence of alpha-MSH (10(-8) -10(-6) M) the melanin content increased by only 35%, whereas Forskolin (10(-5) M) induced a 9.5-fold rise in cAMP after 5 min and a 10.9-fold rise in melanin content after 7 days. When HuMC were irradiated daily for 6 days with UVR (Helarium fluorescent lamps emitting 20% UVB, 80% UVA) melanin content rose 2.7-fold (SE 0.3). This was unchanged or slightly reduced in the presence of alpha-MSH (10(-8)-10(-6) M). Parallel observations on Cloudman S91 melanoma cells showed that alpha-MSH caused only an 80% increase in melanin content after 4 days. The rise in melanin content induced by three daily UV-irradiations (2.4-fold, SE 0.5) was unchanged by alpha-MSH (10(-8)-10(-6) M). Although alpha-MSH induces a small rise in cAMP in HuMC this does not result in melanogenesis, and the response to UVR is not affected by alpha-MSH in either HuMC or S91 cells.\r"

Displacement experiments of the radioligand from its binding site were performed with antagonists and agonists to determine the beta-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity. The binding of (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 was saturable, of high affinity (KD = 0.025 nmol/l, n = 12) and was rapid and readily reversible. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was 33.5 +/- 1.9 fmol/10(7) cells or 2018 +/- 114 receptors per cell. beta-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited binding of the radioligand with monophasic displacement curves. IC50 values were (nmol/l): propranolol (non-selective) 2.82, alprenolol (non-selective) 2.0, ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) 3.5 and bisoprolol (beta 1-selective) 2200. Agonists inhibited binding in the order of potency of isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. It is concluded that cells of the melanoma cell line A-375 contain a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

Studies of labelled keratinocyte cell lines showed that the polypeptides were expressed as alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 integrins. Only the alpha 6 beta 4 integrin showed polarization towards the basement membrane attachment site of basal layer keratinocytes, and was preferentially expressed at microvillous projections. In contrast, alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 integrins were equally expressed throughout the basal cell plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred women who presented with diffuse alopecia, were quantitatively evaluated for hair variables and compared with 20 controls. Fifty were selected for biochemical and haematological investigations, 44 of whom also underwent endocrine evaluation. Compared to controls, significant changes in hair values were found in the frontal area of all subjects, while 84% had significant changes in the occipital area. A biphasic distribution of hair diameter was evident in subjects who had percentages of vellus hair and telogen hair less than or equal to 30 mm in length that were above the control ranges. No significant difference between the mean hormonal values of women with diffuse alopecia and controls could be found. No correlation between hair values and individual or combined hormonal levels could be established. In 18 subjects (40.9%) hormonal values were within the control ranges and these apparently normal findings were often associated with adverse hair profiles. A raised dihydrotestosterone was found in 13 subjects (29.5%) and was the most frequently elevated androgenic finding. Seventeen (34.0%) had changes in iron metabolism, while in 36 (72.0%) serum ferritin levels were below the lowest control value. All had a decrease in the percentage of hair in the anagen growth phase compared to controls. The hair changes were similar to those observed in genetic hair loss in men, a proven androgen-dependent condition. We propose that diffuse androgen-dependent alopecia is the appropriate name to describe this condition in these women.\r"

The transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured using an evaporimeter and skin hydration using a Corneometer and by visual scoring. The group with a history of AD (n = 20) had a lower pre-exposure barrier function and a higher TEWL value following irritant exposure than the group with a history of allergic contact dermatitis (n = 18) and a control group (n = 18). Clinically dry skin was more susceptible than normal skin, though no difference was noted in the pre-exposure barrier function. The increased susceptibility to irritants in those with a past history of AD was probably due to impaired barrier function and/or the presence of a dry skin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cyclosporin A (CyA) on the growth of cultured normal human keratinocytes and fibroblasts was studied. Tritiated thymidine incorporation per DNA content was used for short-term studies (1-2 days) and cell counting for longer term studies (up to 14 days). CyA caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth of both cell types. Keratinocytes (serum free, 70 microM Ca2+) were more sensitive to CyA than fibroblasts (10% serum). For keratinocytes, at 2 days growth was 61% and 6% of controls with 3 and 10 micrograms/ml CyA, respectively, at 4 days growth was 51% with 1 microgram/ml with complete inhibition at 10 micrograms/ml, and at 11 days growth was 58 and 39% with 0.1 and 1 micrograms/ml. For fibroblasts, at 4 days growth was 72 and 58% of controls with 10 and 30 micrograms/ml CyA, respectively, at 10 days growth was 76, 43 and 10% with 3, 10 and 30 micrograms/ml, and at 14 days growth was 41 and 11% with 3 and 10 micrograms/ml with complete inhibition with 30 micrograms/ml. For keratinocytes the effect of 24 h of CyA on growth was reversible. Growth of keratinocytes was inhibited by 10% delipidized serum, and 1% serum had a small stimulatory effect, but the action of CyA was unaltered. We conclude that increasing the duration of exposure to CyA increases the concentration-dependent growth inhibition. At therapeutic blood levels of CyA the growth of cultured keratinocytes but not fibroblasts is inhibited. The benefit of CyA in reducing the hyperproliferation of psoriasis may include a direct effect on keratinocytes.\r"

The method allowed compensation for endogenous immunoglobulins in endometrium and accurate localization of anti-endometrial antibody binding in the cytoplasm of the glandular epithelium. Significantly more women with endometriosis (14/40) were found to have anti-endometrial antibodies than controls (1/40) (P less than 0.001; chi 2). There was no correlation between disease severity and the presence of anti-endometrial antibodies or the intensity of staining.\r"

Compression was also found in two women in the semi-recumbent position. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of aortic compression were non-engagement of the fetal head, occipito-posterior position of the fetal head, and cervical dilatation less than 5 cm.\r"

Hormone receptor content was determined with the DCC-method, receptor values higher than 9 fmol/mg protein were considered positive. Response to postoperative chemotherapy was significantly correlated with PgR content (80% responders in the group with PgR positive tumours and only 61% responders in the group with PgR negative tumours). A Cox proportional hazards regression model identified histological grade, residual tumour, age and PgR content as independent prognostic factors for survival in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma. PgR content had particularly significant prognostic relevance for patients with postoperative residual tumour mass less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter. Within this group of patients, those who are PgR positive have a 2-years survival probability of 83% compared with only 51% in the PgR-negative group.\r"

Acceptable waveforms were obtained from the uterine arteries in 83 and from the fetal umbilical artery in 61 of the 85 pregnancies. There was virtually no difference between the left and right uterine artery on average. The marked decrease in pulsatility (PI) and resistance (RI) indices from both uterine arteries reflects the ongoing process of secondary trophoblast invasion into the muscular part of the spiral arteries. Absent end-diastolic velocities were observed in 59 of 61 fetal umbilical artery flow velocity waveform recordings. PI values from the fetal umbilical artery suggest unaltered umbilical placental vascular resistance during the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

CRP levels in 50 healthy women at 38 weeks gestation did not differ significantly from previously established normal values. CRP levels in 67 healthy women sampled serially in labour from admission to 96 h postpartum confirm the physiological occurrence of a major acute phase response. The serial CRP levels of 16 women with PROM did not differ significantly from the wide range of CRP levels found in the normal postpartum period. This complicates the use of CRP as an early predictor of clinical chorio-amnionitis. Serial SAA levels in 17 women at 38 weeks gestation, immediately postpartum and 24 h postpartum showed a parallel rise to CRP in the peripartum period. Significant differences between maternal and neonatal CRP and SAA levels were demonstrated, implying a lack of transplacental transfer during labour.\r"

A pictorial chart score of 100 or more, when used as a diagnostic test for menorrhagia, was found to have a specificity and sensitivity of greater than 80%. Demonstration of the relation between self assessed pictorial chart scores and the objective measurement of blood loss enables us to provide a simple, cheap and reasonably accurate method of assessing blood loss before embarking upon treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A large number of biologic, technological, and clinical studies await the development of procedures that will allow totipotent hematopoietic stem cells to be expanded in vitro. Previous work has suggested that hematopoiesis can be reconstituted using transplants of cells from long-term marrow cultures. We have used retrovirus mediated gene transfer to demonstrate that marked totipotent hematopoietic stem cells are both maintained and can be amplified in such cultures, and then subsequently regenerate and sustain lympho-myeloid hematopoiesis in irradiated recipients. Marrow cells from 5-fluorouracil-treated male mice were infected with a recombinant virus carrying the neomycin resistence gene and seeded onto irradiated adherent layers of pre-established, long-term marrow cultures of female origin. At 4 weeks, cells from individual cultures were transplanted into single or multiple female recipients. Southern blot analysis of hematopoietic tissue 45 days posttransplantation showed retrovirally marked clones common to lymphoid and myeloid tissues in 14 of 23 mice examined. Strikingly, for 3 of 4 long-term cultures, multiple recipients of cells from a single flask showed marrow and thymus repopulation with the same unique retrovirally marked clone. These results establish the feasibility of retroviral-marking techniques to demonstrate the maintenance of totipotent lympho-myeloid stem cells for at least 4 weeks in the long-term marrow culture system and provide the first evidence of their proliferation in vitro. Therefore, such cultures may serve as a starting point for identifying factors that stimulate totipotent hematopoietic stem cell expansion.\r"

The chromosome 5 abnormalities were consistently present in all abnormal mitoses at the time of diagnosis, as were the chromosome 7 abnormalities in 45 of the 48 patients. Various abnormalities, primarily of the short arm of chromosome 17, were observed in 13 cases, abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 21 were observed in 12 cases, and rearrangements of 11q23 were seen in nine cases. Thirteen patients presented a normal karyotype. Previous therapy with alkylating agents, the presence of an initial myelodysplastic phase, and abnormalities of chromosome 7 or 5 were interdependent. Patients with 11q23 rearrangement typically developed overt leukemia of FAB types M4 or M5a without myelodysplasia and with a short latent period. Evaluated by Cox regression analysis, complete remission of the primary malignancy and a malignant lymphoma as primary tumor were the two most important and independent prognostic factors indicating a longer survival (P = .008). In addition, the platelet count at diagnosis was a significant prognostic factor (P = .01). For the subgroup of 62 patients with myelodysplasia, the number of chromosome aberrations, the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and the hemoglobin level were other significant and independent prognostic factors (P = .05, .05, and .004, respectively). The most important predictive factor for a favorable response to intensive antileukemic chemotherapy in overt leukemia was the absence of a preceding myelodysplastic phase (P = .0014).\r"

Use of recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2) after autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may enhance immune function and hopefully reproduce the allogeneic reaction. We report here the hematologic and immunologic changes observed in the first 10 patients of a phase 1 trial studying the infusion of IL-2 after autologous BMT. All patients had high-risk malignancies and received 6 days of a constant infusion of IL-2 (Eurocetus, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at dose of 3 x 10(6) Cetus Units/m2/d, 79 +/- 12 days after autologous BMT. Clinical toxicities involving cutaneous, cholestatic, gastrointestinal, and hemodynamic effects occurred during IL-2 treatment but reversed in all cases. Completion of treatment was 91% of the scheduled dose of IL-2. Hematologic toxicity was moderate and transient with no graft failure. Increases in eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were significant (P less than .05). Stimulation of the immune system was intense and prolonged, manifested by increase numbers of CD3+, CD3+DR+, CD3+ CD25+ lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells (all P less than .01), and increase of Lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) and NK activities (P less than .01 and P less than .05). This study establishes the feasibility of a 6-day administration of rIL-2 after autologous BMT leading to a major immune activation 2.5 months after BMT.\r"

Nine cats were asymptomatic, 24 had clinical symptoms equivalent to AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 20 had AIDS-like disease. Hematologic abnormalities were detected in 75% (40 of 53) of FIV-seropositive cats, and multiple concurrent cytopenias were common. Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 36%, 53%, 34%, and 8% of FIV-seropositive cats, respectively. Cytopenias were seen only in symptomatic (ARC or AIDS) cats. The occurrence of cytopenias and the distribution of clinical stages were similar in cats with concurrent feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection and those with FIV alone, suggesting that these abnormalities were a direct consequence of FIV infection. In addition, abnormalities were noted in 72% of marrows from symptomatic cats and included hyperplasia of individual cell lineages and dysmorphic features. Our results demonstrate that the hematologic manifestations of FIV infection are strikingly similar to those reported in HIV-seropositive patients. Thus, FIV infection in cats is an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of blood and marrow abnormalities in AIDS, as well as to evaluate the hematologic toxicities of drug therapies.\r"

Exposure of CML cells to IFN-alpha diminished the effect of the CML cytoplasmic proteins on these nuclear protein-DNA complexes. The presence of clinical responsiveness to IFN-alpha correlated with the sensitivity to the IFN-induced change in the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes. These data suggest that the action of IFN-alpha in CML may be linked to a pathway that can result in posttranslational modification of nuclear proteins.\r"

Such cells appeared alone in colonies of less than 50 cells, together with macrophages in mixed colonies and also within clusters of T lymphocytes at high culture cell numbers. The morphologic resemblance to lymphoid dendritic cells was confirmed by electron microscopy and the cells were distinguished from macrophages by immunoenzymatic and immunogold labeling with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Like macrophages they were HLA-DR+ and CD4+. However, they lacked nonspecific esterase and the macrophage cytoplasmic marker Y1/82A. Most strikingly, cells were strongly HLA-DQ+ and expressed CD1a (T6), which is characteristic of skin Langerhans cells. Their functional similarity to lymphoid dendritic cells was demonstrated by their ability to stimulate allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions. Dendritic cell colony numbers were estimated in both bone marrow and peripheral blood of controls and in leukemia and lymphoma patients before and after chemotherapy. Colony numbers were low in control blood and in patients before treatment (less than 1.0 to 3.7/10(5) cells). However, during hematopoietic recovery the mean value increased to 37.5/10(5) cells and this increase correlated closely with the observed increase in circulating colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) in individual patients. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated mitotic activity within CD1a+ colonies and a linear relationship between cultured cells and both pure and mixed colonies was consistent with their derivation from a single precursor. These data indicate that a novel hematopoietic progenitor of dendritic/Langerhans cells (DL-CFU) may now be identified in a clonal assay system and suggest a probable common progenitor for these cells and macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of a number of blood coagulation factors (F) (FX, FIX, FVIII, FVII, alpha-, beta-, gamma-fibrinogen chains, protein C, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was analyzed at RNA and protein level in 5- to 10-week-old human embryos and fetuses. FX, FIX, and FVII were also analyzed at protein level. Total and poly(A)+ RNA, extracted from embryonic-fetal (FL) and adult liver (AL), were analyzed by dot and Northern blot hybridization with specific cDNA probes. The results indicate that: (1) the size of the messenger RNAs of these factors is equivalent in FL and AL; (2) in the 5- to 10-week period, their abundance in FL increases from 30% to 50% of the adult level except for FIX (from 2% to 10%) and FX (always 100% of the adult value). Western blot analysis of FIX, FX, and FVII in 5- to 10-week soluble liver proteins and 6- to 8-week plasma showed a low level of FIX versus a higher concentration of both FVII and FX, when compared with corresponding adult values, ie, a liver protein level of 10% versus 100% and a plasma concentration level of 10% versus 40%. Although little is known so far on the activity and the functional role of the clotting factors in early human ontogenic development, these studies suggest an activation of FX via the FVII/tissue factor activity rather than the FIXa/FVIIIa phospholipid complex in human embryonic and early fetal life.\r"

  ".W": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is clinically characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, iron deficiency anemia, and venous thrombosis. Pathophysiologically the disease has now been generally accepted as an acquired defect of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG)-anchored molecules on the cell surface of bone marrow-derived cells. This defect is functionally characterized by an abnormal susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis and has been described on erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. In contrast, contradictory data exist so far on the involvement of lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against newly defined PIG-linked surface structures such as CD48, CD55, and CD59, which are homogeneously expressed on lymphocytes of normal donors, we analyzed lymphocytes and their subpopulations in nine PNH patients by two color immunofluorescence. Our results showed that CD3+ T cells as well as CD16+ NK cells are at least partially involved in the deficient PIG-molecule surface expression. To more clearly define the defect in PNH, we generated NK clones from a PNH patient. Phenotypic analysis of these NK clones showed that they either were positive (n = 3) for PIG-linked surface structures such as CD48, CD55, and CD59 (eg, NKP1) or were completely negative (n = 7) for all of them (eg, NKP1). In functional tests the PIG-molecule negative clone NKP2 showed increased susceptibility to human complement compared with the PIG molecule positive clone NKP1. When analyzing the mRNA levels of the PIG-linked molecules CD55 and CD59 there was no difference at all between the two clones. We conclude from our data that NK cells as well as other lymphocyte subpopulations are involved in the PIG-linkage defect of PNH. These NK clones with differential expression of PIG-linked surface structures present for the first time ex vivo mutant cell lymphocyte lines that carry the defect leading to PIG deficiency in PNH.\r"

  ".W": "Preclinical studies of resistance to alkylating agents in the Lewis x Brown Norway hybrid (LBN) rat model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have hitherto been limited by the sensitivity of LBN AML cells to cyclophosphamide (CY). We developed a CY-resistant subline of LBN AML by serial intravenous (IV) passage of AML cells followed by in vivo exposure to CY (100 mg/kg) 14 days later. After 18 and subsequent passages, CY-treated AML cells remained viable despite ex vivo incubation with 70 to 100 mumol/L 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) or in vivo exposure to 100 to 300 mg/kg of CY. Once established, resistance to incubation with 4HC was stable in LBN AML cells after at least six serial in vivo passages without exposure to CY. Nevertheless, both control and CY-treated AML cells demonstrated similar dose-dependent sensitivity to 100 to 500 mumol/L phosphoramide mustard (PhM), the active alkylating end-product of CY activation in vivo. Levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which inactivates CY by prevention of formation of PhM, were significantly elevated in these CY-resistant AML cells: cytosolic and particulate ALDH fractions from these cells were 11 to 13 times control with NAD cofactor and propanal substrate and three to four times control with NADP cofactor and benzaldehyde substrate. Further studies with this animal model of AML, in which resistance to CY is mediated by elevated ALDH activity, may elucidate mechanisms for effective elimination of drug-resistant leukemic cells ex vivo and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We report the nonrandom occurrence, frequency, and degree of immunophenotype association of the t(1;14)(p34;q11) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in leukemia cells from 5 of 1,630 (0.3%) consecutive children with newly diagnosed ALL who were entered on a single Pediatric Oncology Group classification study (POG 8600) between January 1986 and February 1989. The frequency of the t(1;14) was 3% (5 of 168 cases) in children with T-cell ALL. All five cases had pseudodiploid karyotypes, and in 3 cases the t(1;14) was accompanied by a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6. This translocation is of special interest because the breakpoint on chromosome 14 in band q11 corresponds to the assigned locus of the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chain gene. All five of our patients and three cases reported previously have had T-cell ALL. These findings, considered together, suggest that this translocation is specific for T-cell ALL and that a gene in the 1p34 region may play an important role in malignant transformation of thymocytes.\r"

  ".T": "Activation mechanisms of adherent human neutrophils.\r", 
  ".U": "90381368\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which unstimulated human neutrophils initiate a respiratory burst on adherence to a surface has been examined. When neutrophils adhere to a plastic surface, they immediately generate a sustained burst of superoxide (O2-). However, this respiratory burst is not initiated by adherence alone, since neutrophils attached to fibronectin fail to mount a response. Adhesion to plastic is calcium (Ca2+) independent, but O2- production requires Ca2(+)-containing buffer in the initiation phase, that is, during adhesion and the early phase of O2- production. The Ca2(+)-dependent step was shown to involve protein kinase C (PK-C) in that the O2- production, but not adherence, was blocked with 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), and PK-C was found to translocate from the cytosol to the membrane on adhesion. Furthermore, it may be inferred that this translocation results in the generation of a Ca2+ independent form of PK-C, PK-M, since leupeptin, which inhibits the generation of PK-M, also blocked O2- production. This finding was corroborated by showing that after 5 minutes in a Ca2(+)-containing buffer, enough time to initiate O2- production and PK-C translocation, Ca2+ is no longer required for sustained O2- release. These results, in aggregate, demonstrate that neutrophils are activated by adhesion to plastic to generate O2-, a PK-C-dependent process that appears to involve a Ca2(+)-independent form of the kinase, PK-M. Why adherent neutrophils generate a respiratory burst on plastic and not fibronectin surfaces probably reflects activation of distinct receptors, whose nature must still be defined. Another issue to address is the priming effect of adhesion, since cells adherent to plastic- or fibronectin-coated surfaces have an enhanced O2- response to formylmethionyl-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP) compared with neutrophils stimulated in suspension. This may relate to increased Ca2+ mobilization, an important mediator of priming for FMLP responses. Thus, adhesion as a priming event does not necessarily initiate cell effector function, and the further elucidation of the plastic and fibronectin models suggests a means of characterizing the crucial event that control neutrophil activation.\r"

  ".U": "90381369\r", 
  ".W": "Adherence of leukocytes to the endothelium is a prerequisite for infiltration and accumulation of cells at an inflammatory site. Recent studies suggest that the CD11/CD18 family of adhesion-promoting receptors plays a crucial role in the initial adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to endothelium. We have studied the effect of the anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) IB4, on movement of PMN in rabbits. Accumulation of PMNs in the skin induced by a local injection of the chemoattractant, zymosan-activated serum (ZAS), was strongly inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, by intravenous injection of IB4. A greater than 95% reduction in PMN accumulation was seen with 1 mg IB4/kg body weight, the highest dose used. PMN-dependent plasma leakage in the ZAS-injected skin sites was also inhibited by pretreatment with MoAb IB4, with a similar dose dependence. Histamine-induced plasma leakage, which is PMN independent, was not affected by this treatment. F(ab)2 fragments of IB4 were as effective as the whole immunoglobulin G molecule in reducing PMN accumulation. The half-life of circulating IB4 in rabbits was found to be 11.5 hours. These results are consistent with in vitro studies that show that binding of PMNs to endothelium requires both expression of CD11/CD18 molecules and activation of the PMNs by agonists, and confirm that sites on CD11/CD18 that recognize endothelial cells are blocked by IB4. Other investigators have shown that injection of chemoattractants into the blood stream causes a rapid neutropenia associated with accumulation of PMNs in the lung. We find that intravenous treatment of animals with IB4 did not block the transient accumulation of PMNs in the lung induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, suggesting that this accumulation occurs by a mechanism that does not require CD11/CD18 molecules.\r"

In these experiments, the partial pressure of oxygen was varied from 156 to 40 mm Hg and the temperature was controlled at 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Three mean cellular hemoglobin concentrations were studied: 29 g/dL, 33 g/dL, and 46 g/dL. The lighter cells (29 and 33 g/dL) exhibited at most a threefold increase in rigidity as the pO2 was decreased from 156 to 40 mm Hg. At 25 degrees C, the densest cells (46 g/dL) also exhibited a threefold increase. However, at 37 degrees C, the rigidity of these cells increased eightfold between 156 to 40 mm Hg. Compared with normal cells, this gives a rigidity that is 18 times larger. In contrast to the values for mu, the values for tc and tf remained essentially unchanged (within the accuracy of the experiments) for the lighter cells and could not be measured for the densest cells.\r"

DESIGN--Cross sectional population based survey (the health and lifestyle survey) of blood pressure measurements and self reported common symptoms. Results were analysed by combined stratification and logistic regression. SUBJECTS--7383 (82%) Adults aged 18 and over chosen from the electoral register in England, Wales, and Scotland for the health and lifestyle survey, in whom satisfactory physiological measurements were taken, from 9003 in the interviewed sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Body mass index, smoking, social class, exercise, self declared physical illnesses, hours slept, use of drugs, and psychological illness as determined with the general health questionnaire assessed as potential confounders. RESULTS--True confounders were sex, age, taking of drugs, physical illness, exercise, and body mass index. A negative association was found between systolic blood pressure and self reported tiredness and feeling faint, which persisted after adjustment for the confounders. The association was strongest in women aged under 50. A negative association between systolic blood pressure and headache and a positive association between systolic blood pressure and palpitation were explained by confounding by age. CONCLUSIONS--Systemic hypotension is associated with persistent tiredness but treatment is not suggested as either possible or necessary. Instead, low blood pressures may be associated with opposite effects on mortality contrasted with morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To introduce and monitor a screening programme for first degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer based on their calculated lifetime risk. DESIGN--Lifetime risks were calculated for first degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer and used to offer screening based on estimated risk. SETTING--A family cancer clinic was set up as part of the North East Thames Regional Genetic Service for relatives of patients who had developed colorectal cancer before the age of 45 and members of families in which multiple cancer had occurred. PATIENTS--Self referrals as well as patients referred by general and hospital practitioners. INTERVENTION--Relatives with a lifetime risk of 1 in 10 or greater (high risk group) were offered screening five yearly by colonoscopy, and those whose risk was between 1 in 10 and 1 in 17 were offered yearly screening for faecal occult blood. Women with family histories compatible with Lynch type II cancer family syndrome were offered screening for breast and pelvic tumours. RESULTS--In four years 715 patients were seen. Acceptance of screening was 90% (644 patients). Of 151 patients screened for faecal occult blood, two were found to have polyps. This screening test was unsatisfactory for the high risk group, having a negative predictive value of 78% in 59 patients tested. Regular screening by colonoscopy was offered to 382 high risk patients; 62 patients with polyps and five with colonic cancer were found. One hundred and ten pedigrees were identified with the Lynch type II cancer family syndrome, and four of 35 women screened were found to have breast cancer. Of 14 relatives aged over 65 with a 1 in 2 risk of site specific colonic cancer or Lynch type II cancer family syndrome, seven were found to have polyps, one of whom had carcinoma in situ. CONCLUSIONS--Family history can be used to identify those at risk of colonic cancer and to target appropriate screening. Colonoscopy detected a high number of premalignant colonic polyps, but faecal occult blood testing was unsatisfactory for those at high risk of colorectal cancer.\r"

Various problems in medical, nursing, and bureaucratic matters were identified--for example, staff failed to understand the appropriate response to various medical symptoms; no clear policy existed for managing pressure sores; and one patient's anticoagulant state could not be assessed when industrial action meant that transport to take him to hospital was not available--and several changes in drug treatments were recommended. The problems that were identified were mainly due to poor communication between the home and general practitioners and hospitals and to the lack of guidance policy on common issues that arise in long term care. Such a policy could be produced by health authority staff, general practitioners, and representatives of nursing homes.\r"

A field echo chemical shift imaging technique was used. T1 values of muscular tissue were measured from the primary composite images, and differential T1 values were calculated separately from water and fat images. Longitudinal relaxation times of skeletal muscle were significantly increased in both dystrophies and myopathies. The results of differential relaxation time measurements suggest that intramuscular fat reduces the abnormal increase in T1 of diseased muscle tissue. When characterizing diseases of skeletal muscle by T1 relaxation time measurements, the contribution of secondary fatty infiltration must be considered.\r"

Chest radiographs of 22 episodes of uncomplicated pneumocystis pneumonia were reviewed and linear opacities were present in nine episodes (41%). Similar opacities were present in 11 out of 121 cases of other pneumonias (9%). Characteristically the opacities are related to the acute illness, usually one to three in number, predominantly basal, 1-4 cm long and less than 2 mm thick. Other radiographic signs of pneumocystis pneumonia were present in all cases. The pathogenesis of these linear opacities is uncertain, but it is possible that they result from areas of sub-segmental atelectasis. The frequency of such linear opacities is much greater in pneumocystis pneumonia (four times) than in other pneumonias and they therefore have some diagnostic value.\r"

The maximal femoral pulse irrespective of the position of the skin crease was the next most popular landmark (24.7%). Bony landmarks were least popular (13.0%). The majority (73.7%) of those using the skin crease punctured at the same level or distal to it. The relationship of these superficial landmarks to the common femoral artery (CFA) and its bifurcation were investigated. The inguinal skin crease was distal to the bifurcation of the CFA in 71.9% of limbs (mean, 0.61 cm). The maximal femoral pulse was over the CFA in 92.7% of limbs, and the CFA was projected over the medial aspect of the femoral head in 77.9% of limbs. The use of the inguinal skin crease is a popular though unreliable guide for puncture of the CFA. Use of the maximal femoral pulse will enable more constant puncture of the CFA.\r"

The most consistent feature was subperiosteal cortical resorption, expressed as a ratio total length of resorbed subperiosteal bone/total length subperiosteal bone x 100. It was found that the extent of resorbed bone was significantly greater in the middle phalanx and on the ulnar surface of the phalanges. The radiological findings over the duration of the disease were compared with laboratory assessments and bone histomorphometry. The extent of the percentage of subperiosteal resorption at base line and its change during the study period correlated significantly with the level of serum parathyroid hormone levels and its change over the same period. No other significant correlations were found between radiographic features and laboratory assessments or with bone histomorphometry.\r"

  ".U": "90381465\r", 
  ".W": "Diversion of portal blood away from the liver can be accomplished in the rat by two straightforward surgical procedures: subcutaneous transposition of the spleen followed later by portal vein ligation. This experimental model has great potential value in the study of liver cell transplants, porto-systemic shunts and hepatic porto-privation. Contrast medium radiology has been used to clarify and define the model further. Splenography, achieved by direct percutaneous puncture, demonstrated the developing spleno-subcutaneous vessels. Collaterals are seen as early as 3 days and appear extensive by 21 days after transposition. Almost all emanate from the convex outer surface of the spleen and course cranially and caudally in the subcutaneous tissues to drain into the subclavian and iliac veins. The appearance of these collaterals correlates well with survival after portal vein occlusion subsequent to splenic transposition. Direct portography demonstrates that, following portal vein ligation, contrast medium is diverted away from the liver into the splenic veins, through and around the spleen, before draining into the systemic circulation through spleno-subcutaneous collaterals. These radiological studies have demonstrated the changed circulatory pathways of this model of portal diversion and have confirmed that it is the splenic veins and the spleno-subcutaneous collaterals which are fundamental to its successful outcome.\r"

  ".U": "90381466\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a peptide which has a fundamental role in controlling proliferation of many cell types. Its main effect upon connective tissues in vivo is to stimulate growth. It can result in endothelial cell proliferation but tends to inhibit epithelial cell growth. Damage to the connective tissues and the vasculature are the principal findings in late radiotherapy damage. Following the initial cellular depletion after radiotherapy, an abnormal proliferation of these tissues occurs, which does not respond to normal feedback mechanisms. Immunocytochemical staining for TGF-beta has been performed upon six patients who had received pre-operative radiotherapy and three patients who had surgery alone for large bowel tumours. Transforming growth factor beta was found in relation to the pathological changes of late radiation damage in the non-tumour-bearing tissues of four out of six previously irradiated patients, but in none of the non-irradiated patients. This paper proposes that TGF-beta activity may modulate late post-radiation changes.\r"

However, unlike A-T cells, DNA synthesis following irradiation was inhibited in a normal manner. This patient represents yet another example of extreme radiosensitivity, and the possibility of clinical prediction in the future is discussed.\r"

Assessment was carried out over a wide range of exposure factors and for a number of different radiological examinations. It is deduced from the results that exposure parameters can be measured with comparable accuracy to standard techniques, and that the automated system is suitable for performing on-line dosimetry.\r"

Male and female examination frequencies were determined as 0.543 and 0.531, respectively. Trends in X-ray examination frequency were followed from 1967 to 1988. Until 1982, the X-ray examination frequency was increasing by an average of 4% per year. Mainly because of a decrease in high dose examinations, the annual examination frequency per caput has been decreasing since then. As a consequence, the somatic effective dose equivalent to the population from diagnostic X-ray examinations is expected to decrease to a value of about 0.4 mSv for the year 1989.\r"

False negative FLASH 90 degrees gadolinium-enhanced MR scans are thought to be a result of either magnetic susceptibility artefact or inferior contrast resolution. False positive FLASH 90 degrees gadolinium-enhanced MR images are a result of either difficulty in interpreting the high signal seen in small vessels or, again, magnetic susceptibility effects. In addition, our study shows small abnormalities suggestive of cerebral metastases on the FLASH 90 degrees gadolinium-enhanced sequences which were not seen on the spin echo T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced sequences. We believe that spin echo T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR sequences demonstrated 131 out of 139 (94.2%) and FLASH 90 degrees gadolinium-enhanced MR sequences detected 122 out of 139 (87.8%) possible metastases. From this, we conclude that spin echo T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR sequences is a better test than FLASH 90 degrees gadolinium-enhanced MR in the diagnosis of brain metastases and that either sequence alone is limited as a screening test.\r"

The degree of motor deficit before treatment was the most important predictor of subsequent motor recovery. One patient had complete reversal of motor deficit and returned to an ambulatory state by chemotherapy alone. The development of spinal cord compression was associated with a short life expectancy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r"

Abdominal pain and distention were the most common presenting symptoms. All patients had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and all but two had debulking surgery. All patients had disease involving the omentum, the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum, and the surface of the ovaries, but none had intrinsic disease of the ovaries. Eight patients had disease outside of the abdominal cavity. Seven of these patients had malignant pleural effusions. All patients received platin-based chemotherapy. Sixteen patients underwent second-look laparotomy, two had no evidence of disease, and one had microscopic disease only. The median survival time for all patients was 17 months. Three patients are alive 6 to 7 years after the initial diagnosis. In conclusion, long-term survival can be achieved in some PSCP patients by debulking surgery and platin-based chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "90381628\r", 
  ".W": "A dose-intensive, cyclophosphamide (CPM)-based chemotherapy regimen was tested in 22 children with newly diagnosed metastatic or refractory neuroblastoma. The N5 protocol consisted of four courses of CPM (140 mg/kg over 2 days), doxorubicin (45 mg/m2 over 3 days), and vincristine (0.05 mg/kg/d on days 1, 2, and 9) (CAV regimen), followed by three courses of cisplatin (40 mg/m2/d) and VP16 (150 mg/m2/d) for 3 days (PVP regimen). Courses started when the neutrophil count was 500/microliters or greater and the platelet count was greater than 100,000/microliters; most courses began by day 21. Extramedullary toxicities were mild. All patients had Grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression, yet bone marrow harvested after the N5 protocol engrafted in 11 of 11 patients whose post-N5 treatments required autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Among 14 previously untreated patients, the N5 plus surgery achieved 9 complete remissions (CR) or very good partial remissions (VGPR) and 3 partial remissions (PR). An additional patient achieved CR with CAV, but experienced a recurrence in the bone marrow after PVP. The sole previously untreated patient whose bone marrow disease did not resolve received courses of the N5 at prolonged intervals (for nonmedical reasons). Among eight patients with progressive (six patients) or refractory (two patients) disease while on other, lower dose regimens, the N5 plus surgery achieved five CR/VGPR, two PR, and one minor response (MR). In conclusion, dose-intensive use of CPM has tolerable toxicity and does not preclude autografting; when administered in conjunction with other cytotoxic agents, it is highly effective against metastatic neuroblastoma and causes regressions of disease resistant to less intensive regimens. This approach plus surgery reliably achieves a minimal disease state that may be amenable to definitive ablation with relatively nontoxic therapies.\r"

The sarcomatous components consisted of one angiosarcoma, one rhabdomyosarcoma, and two cases with mixed angiosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. All patients with sarcomatous elements died; the median survival for these patients was 9 months. In contrast, six (54%) of the patients who did not have sarcomatous elements in their tumor are long-term disease-free survivors 5 to 8 years after diagnosis. The occurrence of sarcomatous elements in a mediastinal germ cell tumor is a poor prognostic sign, and therapy should be oriented to include drugs and regimens that may be effective against sarcoma.\r"

The patients were followed for up to 23 months (median, 4.5 months), and 32 of them were evaluated more than once. Severity of symptoms was related to higher cumulative doses of cisplatin but with marked individual variability. Off-therapy deterioration of the PN continued in 14 patients (31%) for 2.5 to 5.5 months after withdrawal of cisplatin, and only four patients showed some improvement during the follow-up period. Symptomatic deterioration often was heralded by new onset of muscle cramps (with normal Ca2+/Mg2+ levels) and/or by manifestations of probable spinal dorsal column and/or nerve root demyelinating syndromes presenting as either Lhermitte's sign and/or as an electric-shock sensation along the upper extremities when outstretched in 90 degrees shoulder abduction. Cramps and demyelinating syndromes were each noted in 31% of the patients. Muscle cramps tended to resolve several months after withdrawal of therapy, and demyelinating syndromes were always transient (1.5 to 6.0 months) and did not progress despite ongoing therapy in five patients. Our study indicates that, after withdrawal of therapy, patients with cisplatin-induced PN may continue to deteriorate for several months. Manifestations of muscle cramps and demyelinating syndromes signify a worsening course of the PN but should not automatically indicate interruption of therapy.\r"

Four patients had a variant arterial supply. The hepatic artery was occluded repeatedly for 1 hour twice daily for 1 to 17 months (mean, 8.5 months). A complete transient occlusion was obtained in all but three patients, in whom minor collaterals were missed at the initial operation. Collaterals developed in two patients during therapy. Leakage from the balloon occurred in two patients after 5 and 12 months. Two patients developed thrombosis of the hepatic artery during therapy due to the cuff being placed too tightly around the vessel. A complete remission was demonstrated in one patient with HCC, a partial response in three patients (one HCC and two metastatic), stable disease in two patients, and progression in five patients. Median survival for colorectal lesions was 15 months (range, 2 to 23 months) from start of the occlusions. Four of nine patients developed calcifications of their lesions during therapy. One patient with HCC was alive and free of disease 18 months after the start of the occlusions. Both patients with HCC had an obstructed portal vein which may have contributed to the favorable outcome. The occluder was uniformly accepted by the patients who were able to do their occlusions at home.\r"

Sixty-five percent of the tumors showed positive staining for HLA-DR, and these tumors had a higher mean and median survival at 5 years compared with negative tumors. However, on multivariate analysis the difference was not statistically significant. The authors conclude that, although HLA-DR staining is associated with tumors of better prognosis, it cannot be used as an independent prognostic factor.

The DNA histogram classification took into account aneuploidy and S-phase fraction for diploid cases. No significant relationship was found between ploidy and sex, age, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), size of the tumor, histologic differentiation, or Dukes' stage. Aneuploidy was more frequently encountered in distal tumors. Preoperative CEA, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy were individually associated with overall survival. In Dukes' A, B, and C tumors, patients with normal and elevated CEA had no significant difference in overall survival. A relationship was apparent between disease-free survival and site, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy. Multivariate overall survival analysis did not reveal independent prognostic significance of ploidy when all Dukes' stages were considered. In contrast, Dukes' stage, differentiation, and ploidy were good indicators of higher risk of colorectal cancer-related death in patients undergoing curative surgery. Dukes' stage and ploidy were also indicators for recurrence. Thus, routine histopathologic characteristics should be used in combination with quantitative cytologic features for the definition of a relevant prognostic index in colorectal cancer.\r"

In addition, cells from this tumor showed a balanced translocation between chromosomes 4 and 5, deletion of chromosome 9, and monosomy for chromosome 10. The second case was DNA aneuploid and more complex cytogenetically but had, in common with the first case, rearrangement and translocation at the same band on chromosome 1. These cytogenetic changes are compared with abnormalities previously reported for chondrosarcoma. Possible relationships between the nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities and subclassification among chondrosarcomas are discussed.\r"

The karyotype of a third tumor, a Grade 1 papillary carcinoma, was 46,XX,der(5)t(5;10)(p15.3;q11),der(9)t(9;?)(q11;?). A fourth abnormal papillary carcinoma, a Grade 1 tumor, had a t(6;10)(q21;q26.1) as the sole abnormality. Each of the five follicular or anaplastic carcinomas had a complex clonal karyotype. The three follicular carcinomas contained an abnormality of 3p25-p21, along with several other chromosome abnormalities.\r"

Percentage of poorly differentiated tumor (Gleason histologic pattern 4 and/or 5) was related to quantitated cancer volume, cancer location within the prostate, and presence or absence of pelvic lymph node metastasis. A strong correlation was found between cancer volume, percentage of poorly differentiated cancer, and nodal metastasis. Twenty-two of 38 patients with more than 3.2 cc of Gleason histologic pattern 4-5 cancer had nodes with positive results, compared with one of 171 patients with less than 3.2 cc of pattern 4-5 cancer. Gleason histologic patterns 1 and 2 cancer was found mainly in a small subgroup of tumors whose site of origin was in the anatomic transition zone and whose volume was less than 1 cc. Gleason \"cribriform\" histologic pattern 3 cancer was thought to represent mainly intraductal carcinoma. Its increase in area with increasing cancer volume paralleled the increase in pattern 4 cancer and was counter to the decrease in other types of pattern 3 cancer.\r"

The lesions appeared as polypoid nodular masses of variable size with myxoid and hemorrhagic areas. They consisted of compact fascicles of elongated spindle cells with minimal atypia. Myxoid areas of variable extension and scattered inflammatory cells were constant features, whereas diffuse collagen deposition was not common. Despite the striking cellularity of some of the lesions, most showed minimal mitotic activity. Ultrastructurally, the predominant cells had features of myofibroblasts. Six cases studied by immunocytochemical methods expressed vimentin and muscle-specific actin. In addition, two of these cases expressed desmin and two others cytokeratin. Infiltration into the muscularis propria of the urinary bladder was demonstrated in six cases and into the perivesical soft tissues in two. However, none of the eight patients for whom follow-up information is available has had local recurrence or metastasis develop 18 months to 6 years after surgical excision.\r"

Because doubt has been raised about the original assessment of this tumor as benign, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 58 cellular schwannomas from 57 patients were reviewed. The patients were most often middle aged (63% were female), and their tumors most commonly were painless masses with a predilection for the paravertebral region of the retroperitoneum, pelvis, and mediastinum. Most tumors were solitary and encapsulated, and an associated nerve was identified for 43% of the cases. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the tumor's Schwann cell nature. Worrisome features such as bone erosion, hypercellularity, foci of necrosis (four tumors), hyperchromasia, nuclear pleomorphism, and the presence of mitotic figures led to a malignant diagnosis for 28% of the cases. Treatment in all but one case was surgical excision. Two patients also received radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Follow-up of from 1 year to 24 years, 7 months (median of 6 years and mean of 7 years) for 61% (35 cases) of the cases reveals three patients with a local recurrence but no cases in which the tumor metastasized or the patient died of the tumor. Awareness of this tumor type is important so that the surgeon will avoid unnecessary sacrifice of functionally important nerves attached to these tumors and so that needless adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy will not be instituted.\r"

There was a twofold increase in the age-adjusted incidence rates of gastric lymphoma during this time. This increase occurred in both men and women but was limited to people over 60 years of age. Although the reasons for this increase are unknown, the authors speculate that this may be a true increase since neither differences in SEER coding practices nor changes in diagnostic procedures could explain these observations.\r"

Cases were analyzed for age, sex, lesion site, and histologic differentiation. Crude, age-specific, and age-adjusted incidence rates plus birth cohort analyses were also calculated. It was found that incidence rates for both men and women increased over the 51-year period of study. For men, age-adjusted incidence rates (1970 United States standard) increased from 4.9/100,000 in 1935 to 1939 to 8.5/100,000 in 1980 to 1985; for women, rates increased from 0.5/100,000 to 3.3/100,000 for the same period. The male-to-female ratio for intraoral squamous cell carcinoma declined dramatically from 9.8 to 2.6 during the 51-year study period primarily because of the steep rate of increased incidence in women relative to that seen in men. The peak age of intraoral squamous cell carcinoma was the seventh decade. Age-specific analysis showed that the older the age group, the higher the incidence for both sexes. During recent years, there was evidence of slightly increased incidence in men younger than 40. The tongue was the most common site for intraoral squamous cell carcinoma, followed closely by the floor of the mouth. Moderately differentiated tumors were most common (54.3% of the total), followed by both well-differentiated cases (29.1%) and those that were poorly differentiated (16.6%).\r"

Of the other determinants of stage examined, older age, having a family physician, receiving medical checkups, having greater knowledge of cancer, and having no functional loss were most strongly predictive of local stage.

Our only means for accomplishing this end is through complete breast examination when a woman is apparently well. The examination must include modern mammography with the latest techniques as well as a thorough, competent clinical examination. We must perform periodic mass screening of all women who may be subject to breast cancer--all women older than age 35. Such mass screening procedures will reduce the death rate from the disease by up to 30%. Mass screening is the only means we have to save the lives of many women with breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the US, with approximately two-thirds of patients presenting with tumors confined to the breast alone or breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Although all of these women can be rendered free of detectable breast cancer by local therapeutic modalities, many will experience recurrences regionally or at distant sites. Nearly all patients who have distant recurrences will subsequently die of breast cancer. Although metastatic breast cancer responds to a variety of hormonal and chemotherapeutic interventions, it is rare that such therapy is curvative. Hence, there has been great interest in studying adjuvant systemic therapies. There is now a long clinical trial experience with adjuvant therapy in breast cancer that provides an extensive background for implementing recent advances in molecular and cellular biology in the clinical setting. Predictably, these laboratory-clinical correlations will provide important leads for future generations of randomized adjuvant trials, both by helping to target new therapies for particular subsets of patients and by identifying prognostic groups. In this report, current efforts in adjuvant therapy trials and laboratory-clinical correlations being conducted in conjunction with those trials are described.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether pulmonary venous flow and mitral inflow measured by transesophageal pulsed Doppler echocardiography can be used to estimate mean left atrial pressure (LAP), we prospectively studied 47 consecutive patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We correlated Doppler variables of pulmonary venous flow and mitral inflow with simultaneously obtained mean LAP and changes in pressure measured by left atrial or pulmonary artery catheters. Among the pulmonary venous flow variables, the systolic fraction (i.e., the systolic velocity-time integral expressed as a fraction of the sum of systolic and early diastolic velocity-time integrals) correlated most strongly with mean LAP (r = -0.88). Of the mitral inflow variables, the ratio of peak early diastolic to peak late diastolic mitral flow velocity correlated most strongly with mean LAP (r = 0.43), but this correlation was not as strong as that with the systolic fraction of pulmonary venous flow. Similarly, changes in the systolic fraction correlated more strongly with changes in mean LAP (r = -0.78) than did changes in the ratio of peak early diastolic to peak late diastolic mitral inflow velocity (r = 0.68). We conclude that in the surgical setting observed, pulmonary venous flow from transesophageal pulsed Doppler echocardiography can be used to estimate mean LAP. This technique may provide a rapid, simple, and relatively noninvasive means of gauging this variable in patients undergoing intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography.\r"

We have limited the present analysis to those 1,715 patients with a strong suspicion of myocardial infarction, and for these patients, we have calculated the percentages eligible for thrombolysis when various electrocardiographic and delay time criteria are applied, but we have not considered contraindications to thrombolysis. We have also calculated the proportions of all infarctions in this group that would thereby receive the treatment, and the proportions of patients treated that would develop a confirmed infarction. Using the criteria ST elevation on the initial electrocardiogram and arrival in hospital within 6 hours from onset of symptoms, 18% of patients would have been given early intravenous thrombolysis, 37% of confirmed infarctions would have been treated, and 91% of all treated patients would have developed a confirmed infarction; with a delay time criterion of 12 hours, these percentages would have been 20%, 41%, and 91%, respectively; with a criterion of 24 hours, they would have been 22%, 45%, and 90%, respectively. By not considering the initial electrocardiogram and applying only the criterion of delay time, these percentages would have been 70%, 72%, and 45%, respectively, for a delay time of 6 hours; 83%, 84%, and 45%, respectively, for a delay time of 12 hours; and 91%, 92%, and 44%, respectively, for a delay time of 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Regional differences in endothelium-dependent vasomotion, however, have not been studied in relation to the nonuniform development of atherosclerosis. We compared the vasomotor response to increasing doses of acetylcholine of angiographically smooth coronary artery segments prone to atherosclerosis (coronary branch points) with segments remote from branch points (straight segments). In patients with entirely smooth coronary arteries and a dilator response to acetylcholine (group 1, n = 7), branch points and straight segments demonstrated equal and significant dose-dependent dilation to acetylcholine (14.7 +/- 8.9% and 12.3 +/- 12.7%, respectively; p identical to NS). In patients with early atherosclerosis as manifest by luminal coronary irregularities, the lowest dose of acetylcholine (10(-8) M) produced constriction at branch points and slight dilation at straight segments (-6.3 +/- 7.4% vs. +2.2 +/- 7.3%, p less than 0.05). At higher doses of acetylcholine, both branch point and straight segments constricted, but constriction remained more pronounced at branch points. Both branch point and straight segments, however, retained the ability to dilate to the non-endothelium-dependent agent, nitroglycerin. In a third group of patients with angiographically entirely smooth coronary arteries but without dilation to acetylcholine, constriction to acetylcholine again occurred first at branch points. Thus, coronary branch points demonstrate increased sensitivity to acetylcholine-induced constriction in patients with angiographic evidence of early coronary atherosclerosis and in middle-aged patients with smooth coronary arteries. These segments, however, retain the ability to dilate to nitroglycerin. Whether this early evidence of defective endothelium-dependent vasodilation predicts the later development of occlusive atherosclerosis is not yet known.\r"

To investigate this issue in the normal human left ventricle, we studied eight patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries with simultaneous measurement of left ventricular volume (by radionuclide angiography) and pressure (by micromanometer catheter) and coronary sinus blood flow. Electrocardiographic-gated data were obtained in the basal state, during rapid atrial pacing, and during isoproterenol infusion to a similar heart rate. Compared with pacing, isoproterenol increased ejection fraction and reduced end-systolic volume (p less than 0.005), end-systolic pressure (p less than 0.005), and the half-time of pressure decline after peak negative dP/dt (T1/2) (p less than 0.001). Negative diastolic pressure developed in seven of eight patients during isoproterenol (range, -0.5 to -2.4 mm Hg) but in only one of eight during pacing (-0.2 mm Hg). These reduced diastolic pressures during isoproterenol were accompanied by increased stroke volume (reflecting increased transmitral flow) and diminished pulmonary wedge pressure (reflecting left atrial pressure). The magnitude of reduction in minimum diastolic pressure during pacing and isoproterenol was related to the change in end-systolic volume (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001), ejection fraction (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001), T1/2 (r = -0.57, p less than 0.02), and coronary sinus flow (r = 0.73, p less than 0.005). Stronger correlations were observed in analyzing changes during isoproterenol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Frequency analysis of the electrocardiogram with Fourier transform is a sensitive method of detecting late potentials. However, information about localization of late potentials is lost, frequency resolution is poor, and window functions have to be applied. We therefore analyzed multiple segments (25 msec long) of the surface electrocardiogram (\"spectrotemporal mapping\") with adaptive frequency determination (AFD), an autoregressive algorithm that is characterized by high-frequency resolution in very short segments without the use of window functions. Results were compared with those from Fourier transform and the Simson method. We studied 38 patients after myocardial infarction (MI) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), 21 patients after MI without VT, and 18 healthy subjects. Frequency peaks could be clearly differentiated until a minimal interval of 6 Hz; with fast Fourier transform (Blackman Harris window) in a much longer segment (80 msec), the spectral peaks merged into one another at an interval of about 30 Hz. AFD revealed high-frequency components as narrow peaks in the range of 40-160 Hz in 28 of 38 patients (74%) after MI with VT. Because of the short segment size, exact localization of late potentials was possible; in most of the patients, the peaks occurred in segments inside the QRS complex and ended 20 +/- 10 msec after termination of the QRS complex. In patients after MI without VT, only four of 21 patients (19%) had spectral peaks in segments after the end of the QRS complex; however, 13 of 21 patients demonstrated microvolt potentials in segments within the QRS complex. These potentials did not extend beyond the end of normal ventricular activation. Only two of 18 healthy subjects showed abnormal AFD results. Patients with bundle branch block did not need to be excluded. AFD allowed good differentiation between late potentials and noise by a characteristic pattern of the spectral peaks. For the Simson method, patients with bundle branch block had to be excluded, and overall sensitivity was 42%. In five cases, the cause of failure of the Simson method could be identified as incorrect determination of the QRS limits due to noise. Thus, AFD is a promising method for detailed analysis of late potentials; it combines the advantages of frequency analysis (good differentiation between signal and noise and high-pass filters not necessary) and time domain analysis (localization of late potentials).\r"

  ".W": "To assess the likelihood of procedural success in patients with multivessel coronary disease undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty, 350 consecutive patients (1,100 stenoses) from four clinical sites were evaluated. Eighteen variables characterizing the severity and morphology of each stenosis and 18 patient-related variables were assessed at a core angiographic laboratory and at the clinical sites. Most patients had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina (72%) and two-vessel coronary disease (78%). Left ventricular function was generally well preserved (mean ejection fraction, 58 +/- 12%; range, 18-85%) and 1.9 +/- 1.0 stenoses per patient had attempted percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Procedural success (less than or equal to 50% final diameter stenosis in one or more stenoses and no major ischemic complications) was achieved in 290 patients (82.8%), and an additional nine patients (2.6%) had a reduction in diameter stenosis by 20% or more with a final diameter stenosis 51-60% and were without major complications. Major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, or emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 30 patients (8.6%). In-hospital mortality was 1.1%. Stepwise regression analysis determined that a modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force (ACC/AHA) classification of the primary target stenosis (with type B prospectively divided into type B1 [one type B characteristic] and type B2 [greater than or equal to two type B characteristics]) and the presence of diabetes mellitus were the only variables independently predictive of procedural outcome (target stenosis modified ACC/AHA score; p less than 0.001 for both success and complications; diabetes mellitus: p = 0.003 for success and p = 0.016 for complications). Analysis of success and complications on a per stenosis dilated basis showed, for type A stenoses, a 92% success and a 2% complication rate; for type B1 stenoses, an 84% success and a 4% complication rate; for type B2 stenoses, a 76% success and a 10% complication rate; and for type C stenoses, a 61% success and a 21% complication rate. The subdivision into types B1 and B2 provided significantly more information in this clinically important intermediate risk group than did the standard ACC/AHA scheme. The stenosis characteristics of chronic total occlusion, high grade (80-99% diameter) stenosis, stenosis bend of more than 60 degrees, and excessive tortuosity were particularly predictive of adverse procedural outcome. This improved scheme may improve clinical decision making and provide a framework on which to base meaningful subgroup analysis in randomized trials assessing the efficacy of percutaneous coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to define the in-hospital and late clinical outcome at 5 years in 430 patients who had a failed elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during their hospitalization. This group comprised 5.9% of 7,246 patients undergoing elective PTCA. CABG surgery was performed in 346 patients with ongoing myocardial ischemia (80.5%) and in 84 patients without ischemia (19.5%). Their mean age was 56 +/- 9 years, and 76.3% were male. One-vessel disease was present in 72.3%, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 59 +/- 11%. Overall, 1.9 +/- 0.9 bypass grafts were placed. There was increased use of the internal thoracic artery in the nonischemic group. A new nonfatal postprocedural Q wave myocardial infarction occurred in 21.2% and occurred more frequently in the ischemic (25.4%) than in the nonischemic (3.6%) group (p less than 0.0001). There were six in-hospital deaths (1.4%), an incidence that did not differ between the two groups. Follow-up was 99.8% complete. There were 25 deaths (93.2 +/- 1.5%, 5-year survival), including 16 of cardiac cause (95.3 +/- 1.3%, 5-year cardiac survival). Q wave myocardial infarction occurred in 111 patients (91 in-hospital), and freedom from cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 5 years was 71 +/- 3%. In the group going to CABG surgery with ongoing ischemia, the 5-year cardiac survival was 94.9 +/- 1.6%, and in the group without ischemia, the corresponding survival was 96.2 +/- 2.2%. By multivariate analysis, the presence of preoperative myocardial ischemia, pre-PTCA diameter stenosis less than 90%, and the presence of multiple-vessel disease correlated with the occurrence of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 5 years. At this large-volume center with extensive PTCA operator and surgical experience, the excellent survival and low event rates over 5 years support the concept that despite the failed elective PTCA procedure, there was little effect on long-term survival provided the patient underwent prompt successful surgical revascularization.\r"

Whether this also occurs in the so-called \"physiological\" cardiac hypertrophy of the athlete, however, is unknown. We studied nine sedentary healthy subjects and 19 age-matched professional runners or hammer throwers who had trained at least 2 hours per day, 5 days per week for 7 years. The left ventricular mass index (echocardiography) was 99 +/- 7.4 and 135 +/- 5.9 g/m2 in the two groups, respectively. Cardiopulmonary receptor stimulation and deactivation were obtained by increasing and reducing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter for 5 minutes by leg raising and lower body negative pressure, keeping both stimuli at a level not affecting blood pressure and heart rate. In the sedentary healthy subjects, forearm vascular resistance (the ratio between mean arterial pressure and forearm blood flow) and plasma norepinephrine fell during leg raising (forearm vascular resistance, -7 +/- 1.7 units; norepinephrine, -57.4 +/- 1.4 pg/ml) and increased during lower, body negative pressure (forearm vascular resistance, 20 +/- 5.3 units; norepinephrine, 97.7 +/- 21.5 pg/ml). For similar or greater alterations in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the correspondent changes observed in the professional runners or hammer throwers were -5.3 +/- 1.3 units (forearm vascular resistance), -35.4 +/- 9.6 pg/ml (norepinephrine), 9.1 +/- 1.4 units (forearm vascular resistance), and 30.9 +/- 6.9 pg/ml (norepinephrine). This represented an attenuation of 25%, 38%, 55%, and 68%, respectively (p less than 0.01), of the control response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in association with systemic hypertension and may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Few studies have investigated the determinants of left ventricular mass (LVM) in young patients with essential hypertension. Therefore, we studied 104 children and adolescents with blood pressure persistently greater than the 90th percentile for age and sex and with no known cause of blood pressure elevation. LVM was determined by echocardiography and was indexed by height to account for body size. The mean LVM index was 90.2 +/- 26.0 g/m. Using the gender-specific 95th percentile from normal children, 40 subjects (38.5%) had left ventricular hypertrophy. Using multiple regression analysis, the significant independent direct correlates of LVM index were male sex, body mass index, dietary sodium intake, age at diagnosis, and systolic blood pressure at maximum exercise. The significant independent inverse correlate of LVM index was resting heart rate (p less than 0.05). These variables accounted for a substantial portion of the LVM index variance in this population (multiple R2 = 0.56, p less than 0.001). The results indicate that left ventricular hypertrophy is prevalent in children and adolescents with essential hypertension. The direct association of LVM index with body mass index and dietary sodium intake suggests weight reduction and dietary salt restriction might be useful to prevent or treat the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in pediatric patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Programmed ventricular stimuli introduced during sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia frequently reset the tachycardia, resulting in a less than fully compensatory pause. A resetting response curve is generated when the set of return cycles is evaluated as the function of the coupling intervals of the extrastimuli delivered during the ventricular tachycardia. If the stimulated wave front encounters tissue within the tachycardia circuit that is not fully recovered, interval-dependent conduction changes should occur producing an increasing resetting response pattern. We quantified the magnitude of this interval-dependent conduction slowing in 17 morphologically distinct ventricular tachycardias. The slope of the increasing limb of the resetting response curve was determined by linear regression analysis and ranged from -0.30 to -1.14 (mean +/- SD, 0.70 +/- 0.25). Seven of the 17 ventricular tachycardias (41%) terminated during introduction of ventricular extrastimuli. The slope of the resetting response pattern in those ventricular tachycardias that terminated were significantly steeper than in those that did not terminate (-0.85 +/- 0.15 versus -0.61 +/- 0.21, respectively, p = 0.025). Six of the seven ventricular tachycardias terminated with programmed ventricular stimuli had a slope steeper than -0.75, whereas only one of 10 ventricular tachycardias that did not terminate exceeded this value. In conclusion, the slope of the increasing portion of the resetting response curve correlates with ability to terminate uniform sustained ventricular tachycardia by timed extrastimuli. This slope is the quantification of the magnitude of interval-dependent conduction slowing. Additionally, tissue within the reentrant circuit displaying greater degrees of interval-dependent conduction slowing may also have relatively longer effective refractory periods.\r"

Simultaneous 24-48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring were performed during unrestricted daily activities. Of the 92 transient ischemic events recorded during monitoring, 85 (92%) were silent. Sixty-one percent of the silent events were preceded by an increase in the heart rate of 5 beats/min or more. Seventy-three percent of the silent ischemic events showed an average increase of 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure within 6 minutes preceding the onset of ST segment depression. The silent ischemic events showed a circadian pattern with a high density (34% of total events) between 6:00 AM and noon. The increase in heart rate and blood pressure paralleled the increase in silent ischemic events during these hours. These results showing significant (p less than 0.001 for both) increases in heart rate and blood pressure preceding a majority of silent ischemic events suggest that increase in myocardial oxygen demand plays a significant role in the genesis of silent ischemia. This pathophysiological mechanism has important therapeutic implications.\r"

All patients had concurrent coronary angiography. Patients were excluded if they had prior coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery. Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-generated polar maps. Chest pain during exercise was as frequent in patients with normal coronary arteries (12%) as in those with significant (greater than 50% stenosis) coronary artery disease (CAD) (14%). In the 219 patients with significant CAD, silent ischemia was fivefold more common than symptomatic ischemia (83% versus 17%, p = 0.0001). However, there were no differences in the extent, severity, or distribution of coronary stenoses in patients with silent or symptomatic ischemia. Our major observation was that the extent of quantified SPECT perfusion defects was nearly identical in patients with (20.9 +/- 15.9%) and without (20.5 +/- 15.6%) exertional chest pain. The sensitivity for detecting the presence of CAD was significantly improved with quantitative SPECT compared with stress electrocardiography (87% versus 65%, p = 0.0001). Although scintigraphic and electrocardiographic evidence of exercise-induced ischemia were comparable in patients with chest pain (67% versus 73%, respectively; p = NS), SPECT was superior to stress electrocardiography for detecting silent myocardial ischemia (52% versus 35%, respectively; p = 0.01). The majority of patients in this study with CAD who developed ischemia during exercise testing were asymptomatic, although they exhibited an angiographic profile and extent of abnormally perfused myocardium similar to those of patients with symptomatic ischemia. The prognostic significance of quantified perfusion defects detected by SPECT remains to be assessed.\r"

An age-related decrease in peak early filling velocity, increase in peak late velocity, and augmentation in the late/early ratio of peak velocities at the tricuspid anulus were observed (r = -0.68, 0.63, and 0.84, respectively). Significant correlations were also found between age and first third, first half, and atrial filling fractions (r = -0.60, -0.72, and 0.69, respectively). Weaker relations were observed between heart rate and Doppler-derived diastolic parameters (r = 0.18-0.54). Right ventricular filling indexes related significantly to those of the left ventricle (r = 0.58-0.88), the best being for the late/early ratio of peak velocities. With inspiration, an increase in early and late right ventricular filling occurred, whereas a reduction in filling occurred in the left ventricle. Thus, careful consideration for age, heart rate, and respiration is necessary in examining the effect of disease states or therapeutics on the filling dynamics of either the right or left ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal motion of the interventricular septum is frequently observed after uncomplicated cardiac surgery. We sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by using continuous echocardiographic imaging of the heart from a constant transesophageal location in 21 patients undergoing their first cardiac operation. Quantitative global and regional functional analyses were performed in each patient at baseline (stage 1), after median sternotomy (stage 2), after sternal retraction (stage 3), after pericardiotomy (stage 4), after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass (stage 5), and after chest closure (stage 6). During the first four surgical stages, mean left ventricular fractional shortening varied little among regions with a fixed reference system (maximum range, 31.6-39.2%; p = NS) but changed dramatically after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (stage 5). The apparent medial hypokinesis that was observed (4.9 +/- 4.7% [SD]) was accompanied by lateral hyperkinesis (65.2 +/- 4.1%, p less than 0.0001). These regional differences were completely eliminated with a floating reference system (33.6 +/- 2.7% for medial, and 34.8 +/- 1.7% for lateral; p = NS), suggesting cardiac translation. Quantitative curvature analysis supported this conclusion, with preservation of baseline regional curvature seen throughout the procedure. The mean length of individual translational vectors (reflecting systolic movement of the endocardial centroid) remained minimal (less than or equal to 1.0 mm) through stage 4 but increased more than fourfold at stage 5, continuing in a medial direction after chest closure (5.2 +/- 3.0 mm and 271 +/- 6 degrees from anterior). Thus, abnormal postoperative septal motion is not caused by removal of restraining forces of the pericardium or anterior mediastinum but rather appears to be directly related to events occurring during cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

The ventricles were paced via multielectrode needle arrays placed transmurally in from four to six locations in the wall of the left ventricle.

The four indexes evaluated were the maximum and average gradients of activation isochrones around the site of earliest epicardial activation, the QRS area at the site of earliest epicardial activation, the interval between the QRS onset computed from all 64 epicardial surface electrograms, and the time of the minimum dV/dt in the electrogram displaying the earliest epicardial activation time (t(ee)-t(rmso) interval). Correlation coefficients between depth of stimulation and average and maximum gradients of isochrones, QRS area at the site of earliest epicardial activation, and t(ee)-t(rmso) interval were 0.985 or higher. These methods, particularly those involving gradients of isochrones, should be useful for evaluating electromaps of patients undergoing surgery for ablation of tachyarrhythmias.\r"

After undergoing rapid whole-body freezing on the 21st day, they were studied by means of serial cross-sectional photographs of the frozen thorax. Fetuses with normal heart treated with bis-diamine served as control. Tetralogy of Fallot and absent pulmonary valve in the fetus was associated with absence of the ductus arteriosus, enlargement and hypertrophy of both ventricles, and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries that compressed the bronchial trees. These abnormalities were inversely correlated with the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Milder stenosis (pulmonary valve ring greater than 50% of control, n = 28) was associated with larger pulmonary arteries (250 +/- 12% of control) (mean +/- SEM) and larger ventricles (volume, 200 +/- 15%; mass, 130 +/- 4%). Severe stenosis (pulmonary valve ring less than 50% of control, n = 14) was associated with mildly enlarged pulmonary arteries and mild bronchial compression. We concluded that enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and bronchial compression develop in fetal life and are associated with mild pulmonary stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot and absent pulmonary valve.\r"

  ".U": "90381893\r", 
  ".W": "The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) is useful in assessing acute changes in contractile state. However, a limitation of ESPVR is that its slope decreases progressively as ventricular size increases without this change necessarily indicating a change in contractile state. In this respect, an index of contractile function that is independent of ventricular size would have an obvious advantage. The exponential constant (k) of the end-systolic relation between wall stress (sigma) and the natural logarithm of the reciprocal of wall thickness [ln(1/H)], sigma = Cekln(1/H), corresponds to the stiffness constant of the myocardium (kSM), a contractile index that should be independent of ventricular size and geometry. To examine the size independence of kSM, we studied left ventricular kSM during beta-blockade (to stabilize inotropic state) in 25 normal dogs with greatly differing ventricular sizes whose end-diastolic volumes ranged from 14 to 82 ml. The kSM was nearly constant (3.6 +/- 0.4) over this wide range of end-diastolic volumes and thus was independent of end-diastolic volume. Conversely, ESPVR, also obtained during beta-blockade, was closely and negatively correlated to end-diastolic volume (r = 0.92). To test the ability of kSM to measure changes in contractile state, we altered contractile state pharmacologically. The kSM increased from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 4.8 +/- 0.8 (p less than 0.01) with infusion of dobutamine (after reversal of beta-blockade) and decreased to 3.1 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) with inhalation of isoflurane, a negative inotrope, during beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). We conclude that kSM is independent of ventricular size and is sensitive to changes in inotropic state. As such, it should be useful as an index of contractile function.\r"

Because the antihypertensive potassium channel activators pinacidil and cromakalim are known to accelerate repolarization in cardiac tissues, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to test the hypothesis that these agents would block the arrhythmogenic effects of delayed repolarization. Early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity were elicited in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers driven at cycle lengths of 4 seconds or more (K0, 2.7 mM) during superfusion with quinidine, cesium, or sematilide, a methylsulfonylamino parasubstituted analogue of procainamide with class III antiarrhythmic activity. The potassium channel activators invariably (17 of 17) abolished this form of abnormal automaticity. This effect was observed at low concentrations that did not alter action potential characteristics at shorter cycle lengths. Intravenous Cs+ (total dose, 4.5 mM/kg) was used to produce ventricular arrhythmias in anesthetized rabbits randomly pretreated in a double-blind fashion with either low-dose pinacidil (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Pinacidil pretreatment resulted in significantly fewer total ventricular ectopic beats (168 +/- 157 versus 582 +/- 448, p less than 0.005) and episodes of ventricular tachycardia (four of nine versus nine of nine, p = 0.057). At this dose, pinacidil did not alter mean blood pressure before Cs+ and maximal hypertensive response after Cs+. In summary, the potassium channel activators pinacidil and cromakalim suppressed triggered activity related to prolonged repolarization at concentrations that did not affect action potential characteristics at normal rates in vitro; pinacidil blunted arrhythmias produced by cesium administration in vivo without lowering blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Echocardiographic and hemodynamic data were measured in closed-chest dogs during graded cardiac tamponade (pericardial pressure 5, 10, and 15 mm Hg) before and after production of diffuse ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular dysfunction was produced by intracoronary injection of nonradioactive microspheres (54 +/- 3.9 mm diameter). Changes in left atrial pressure with cardiac tamponade were influenced by coexisting left ventricular dysfunction. Left atrial pressure increased with tamponade and was equal to pericardial pressure before left ventricular dysfunction was produced. However, after left ventricular dysfunction was produced, left atrial pressure was significantly higher than pericardial pressure before tamponade, but it fell toward pericardial pressure when tamponade was produced. Pulsus paradoxus (greater than 10 mm Hg) was present in all animals with cardiac tamponade before left ventricular dysfunction but in only one animal afterward. During each level of tamponade, the inspiratory fall of aortic systolic pressure was greater before than with left ventricular dysfunction. The slope of the linear regression between pericardial pressure and millimeters of mercury of inspiratory fall in aortic systolic pressure was significantly greater before than with left ventricular dysfunction (0.74 +/- 0.12 versus 0.32 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular dysfunction caused a leftward and upward shift of the pericardial pressure-volume relation. As a result, right atrial and ventricular collapse occurred with significantly smaller volumes of pericardial fluid after than before left ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that pulsus paradoxus may be absent in cardiac tamponade with coexisting left ventricular dysfunction and unequal filling pressures. Echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade may occur with small effusions in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The aim of the present study was to determine whether myocardial blood flow could be assessed quantitatively with 82Rb and PET. Because the myocardial extraction fraction of 82Rb varies inversely and nonlinearly with flow and cannot be measured conveniently with PET, we used an experimentally derived mathematical function defining the relation between single-pass extraction fraction of 82Rb and flow to obviate the necessity of measuring the extraction fraction directly. Myocardial blood flow in absolute terms (ml/g/min) was estimated from dynamic PET scans after intravenous administration of 82Rb in intact dogs and compared with flows measured with radiolabeled microspheres. In 36 comparisons in 13 dogs studied at rest, or after coronary occlusion, reperfusion, or after coronary hyperemia induced with intravenous dipyridamole, over the flow range from 0.2 to 2.0 ml/g/min, estimates of perfusion with rubidium correlated well with flows measured concomitantly with microspheres, although there was a slight underestimation of flow with rubidium (flow by 82Rb = 0.92 x flow by microspheres-0.021, r = 0.83). In general, estimates of flow in ischemic regions were less reliable than estimates for regions with normal flow. Thus, although the relation between myocardial extraction and retention of 82Rb and flow can vary under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, this study demonstrates the ability to obtain quantitative estimates of myocardial blood flow with 82Rb and PET under carefully defined conditions without measuring the extraction fraction directly.\r"

Using the picrosirius-polarization technique to enhance collagen birefringence, we sought to examine the structural integrity of the collagen matrix and interstitium. In the dilated failing ventricle secondary to rapid pacing, we found 1) interstitial edema and a disruption or disappearance of collagen fibers that were apparent within 6 hours of pacing, persisted for weeks, and subsequently were associated with muscle fiber disorganization within the endomyocardium, 2) interstitial fibrosis that was present in the midwall and epimyocardium with chronic pacing, and 3) an early remodeling of intramyocardial coronary arteries that included medial swelling with smooth muscle degeneration followed by proliferative lesions involving fibroblasts and a subsequent perivascular and medial fibrosis. Many of these findings were still evident 48 hours after pacing had been discontinued. In contrast, the collagen matrix and interstitium seen with ventricular dilatation secondary to the circulatory overload that accompanies an aortocaval fistula were indistinguishable from that in sham-operated controls. Thus, we conclude that unlike the chamber enlargement and preserved ventricular function that accompany an aortocaval fistula, ventricular dilatation and failure caused by rapid pacing are based on an architectural remodeling of the myocardium. This structural dilatation involves the extracellular matrix and interstitium and appears to be related to altered permeability of intramyocardial coronary arteries. The mechanism or mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial remodeling with rapid ventricular pacing require further investigation.\r"

  ".U": "90381898\r", 
  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion have been shown to impair coronary vasorelaxation to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. To examine the time course of this dysfunction, occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery (90 minutes) was followed by reperfusion for 0, 2.5, 5, 20, 180, or 270 minutes. Coronary arterial rings from the ischemic LAD and control left circumflex (LCx) arteries were tested for responsiveness to the endothelium-dependent receptor-mediated vasodilator, acetylcholine (ACh), and the endothelium-dependent nonreceptor-mediated vasodilator, A23187, as well as the endothelium-independent vasodilator, NaNO2. ACh relaxation was not impaired after 90 minutes of ischemia without reperfusion. However, 2.5 minutes of reperfusion resulted in depressed ACh responses (36 +/- 10% of control) that was further reduced to 16 +/- 6% at 20 minutes, and remained comparably depressed at every time thereafter. A23187 vasodilator responses were also attenuated after reperfusion, although the reduced response occurred later (that is, at 20 minutes). There was no significant decrease in response to NaNO2 in the LAD at any time or to any vasodilator in LCx control rings. Treatment with recombinant human superoxide dismutase (hSOD, 5 mg/kg/hr, that is, 15,545 SOD units/kg/hr), starting 10 minutes before reperfusion, preserved the vasodilator response to ACh (82 +/- 6%) and A23187, but treatment with the hydroxyl ion scavenger N-(2-mercapto proprionyl)-glycine (MPG) (8 mg/kg/hr) only protected the A23187 response. No damage to the surface of the endothelium was observed by scanning electron microscopy at any time point. Myocardial cell damage increased with time of reperfusion as assessed by increasing plasma CK activities and amounts of necrotic tissue indexed to area at risk. Significant myocardial injury occurred at 3 hours after reperfusion. These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction resulting in reduced endothelium-derived relaxing factor release occurs before the development of myocardial cell necrosis and may be due to oxygen-derived free radicals produced rapidly on reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Serial myocardial imaging with technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) has been proposed for evaluating myocardial salvage after reperfusion. To define 99mTc-MIBI uptake before and after reperfusion, 17 open-chest dogs underwent 3 hours of left anterior descending artery occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion. 99mTc-MIBI was injected during occlusion (group 1) or after 90 minutes of reperfusion (group 2). Myocardial 99mTc-MIBI activity was correlated with microsphere flow during occlusion and reperfusion. Anatomic risk area and infarct area were defined by postmortem vital staining and correlated with the perfusion defects defined by analysis of 99mTc-MIBI macroautoradiographs and gamma camera images of myocardial slices. The left ventricle was divided into 96 segments for gamma well counting. Flow and 99mTc-MIBI activity were normalized to nonischemic values. Myocardial segments were grouped, based on occlusion flow, into zones: severely ischemic (less than or equal to 30% nonischemic), moderately ischemic (greater than 30%, less than or equal to 60% nonischemic), mildly ischemic (greater than 60%, less than or equal to 90% nonischemic), and nonischemic (greater than 90%, less than or equal to 120% nonischemic). Among dogs injected with 99mTc-MIBI during coronary occlusion (group 1), myocardial 99mTc-MIBI activity correlated linearly with occlusion flow for both endocardial (r = 0.91) and transmural (r = 0.91) segments. The risk area defined by 99mTc-MIBI autoradiography (group 1) correlated with the postmortem risk area (rho = 0.94) but was 29% smaller than the anatomic risk area (p = 0.03), reflecting the contribution of collateral flow. Among dogs injected with 99mTc-MIBI after reperfusion (group 2), myocardial 99mTc-MIBI did not correlate with reperfusion flow in either endocardial or transmural segments. Among group 2 dogs, myocardial 99mTc-MIBI activity was significantly less than reperfusion flow at the time of injection in the severely ischemic (25 +/- 5% versus 74 +/- 24% nonischemic, p = 0.002), moderately ischemic (54 +/- 12% versus 96 +/- 15% nonischemic, p = 0.001), and mildly ischemic (84 +/- 6% versus 93 +/- 3% nonischemic, p = 0.002) zones. The defect area defined by 99mTc-MIBI autoradiography (group 2) correlated very closely with the postmortem infarct area (rho = 0.98). Thus, the myocardial uptake of 99mTc-MIBI during coronary occlusion correlates with occlusion flow and reflects the \"area at risk.\" When 99mTc-MIBI was given after 90 minutes of reperfusion following 3 hours of coronary occlusion, the myocardial activity was significantly reduced compared with reperfusion flow in both necrotic and perinecrotic regions, reflecting myocardial viability more than the degree of reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Nine mongrel dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes (EMF) to measure coronary blood flow through the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) coronary arteries at rest and after maximal coronary vasodilation (1 mg/kg/min adenosine). Relative coronary blood flow was determined by parametric imaging in the left posterior oblique projection using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Transmural myocardial perfusion of the LAD and LCx beds was determined with tracer-labeled microspheres. Coronary flow reserve (maximal coronary blood flow divided by resting blood flow) was calculated under control conditions and after constriction of the proximal LAD or LCx by a screw occluder. Heart rate decreased significantly from 140 beats/min at rest to 122 beats/min after adenosine (p less than 0.001) and from 134 (rest) to 120 beats/min (adenosine; p less than 0.05) after coronary constriction. Peak systolic pressure was kept constant with an aortic constrictor. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly from 18 mm Hg at rest to 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after coronary constriction. At baseline, coronary flow reserve was 4.2 with DSA, 3.8 with EMF, and 3.7 with microspheres; after coronary constriction, it was 2.6 (DSA), 1.9 (EMF), and 1.5 (microspheres) (all p less than 0.001 versus baseline). Coronary blood flow showed a good correlation between EMF and microspheres (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001), with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 0.78 ml/g/min. Coronary flow reserve also showed a good correlation between EMF and microspheres (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001), with an SEE of 0.93. There was a moderate correlation between EMF and DSA (r = 0.68, p less than 0.001), with an SEE of 1.35 (40% of mean coronary flow reserve). The correlation coefficient between microspheres and DSA was 0.54 (p less than 0.01), with an SEE of 1.46 (39% of mean coronary flow reserve). The mean difference (accuracy) and standard deviation of difference (precision) were 0.2 +/- 1.0 between EMF and microspheres, -0.1 +/- 1.4 between EMF and DSA, and -0.6 +/- 1.7 between microspheres and DSA. We conclude that determination of coronary flow reserve by parametric imaging is associated with large variations that are greater than variations also inherent in the two reference techniques. Parametric imaging allows relatively accurate assessment of coronary flow reserve (small mean difference), but precision is low (large standard deviation of mean differences).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether blood vessels could develop de novo between an extracardiac artery and a collateral-dependent zone of the heart and to quantify the nutritive blood flow afforded by the new vessels. We also adapted the preparation so that angiogenically active agents could be chronically administered directly to the site of neovascularization in subsequent studies. To induce neovascularization between a systemic artery and the coronary circulation, the left internal mammary artery (IMA) was implanted in an intramyocardial tunnel in proximity to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). A tube situated in the distal IMA connected to an implanted pump provided for continuous intra-arterial infusion at the site of angiogenesis. During the same procedure, an ameroid constrictor was placed on the proximal LAD, rendering its perfusion territory collateral dependent during a 2-3 week period. After 8 weeks, the functional capacity of the anastomoses established between the implanted IMA and the LAD territory was assessed by determining regional myocardial blood flow under basal conditions, during adenosine-induced vasodilatation, and during differential occlusions of the IMA and left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA). For all dogs, IMA occlusion decreased maximal LAD territory flow from 1.31 +/- 0.11 to 1.16 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g (p less than 0.005). Occlusion of the LCCA decreased LAD zone flow to 0.73 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g, whereas occlusion of the IMA in addition to the LCCA further decreased LAD zone flow to 0.42 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g (p less than 0.02). The IMA provided measurable nutritive blood flow in seven of 12 dogs, and in these dogs, the artery provided 30.0 +/- 2.5% of total LAD zone collateral conductance under conditions of maximal vasodilatation (range, 23-42%). We conclude that angiogenesis can occur between an implanted internal mammary artery and the native coronary circulation in dogs, providing modest nutritive blood flow to a collateral-dependent region. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether direct, local infusion of angiogenically active factors can enhance neovascularization and whether sufficient flow can be reliably supplied to make some variant of this approach clinically applicable.\r"

In the St. Jude valve, significant differences between Doppler and catheter gradients measured 30 mm downstream from the valve were found: Doppler gradients exceeded peak catheter gradients of 10 mm Hg or more by 81 +/- 35% (15 +/- 3.6 mm Hg), and mean catheter gradients by 71 +/- 11% (10.3 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). When the catheter was pulled back through the tunnel-like central orifice of the valve, high localized gradients at the valve plane and significant early pressure recovery were found. When the catheter was pulled back through the large side orifices, gradients at the same level were only 46 +/- 6% of the central orifice gradients (mean difference, 7.6 +/- 4.5 mm Hg). Doppler peak and mean gradients showed excellent agreement with the highest central orifice catheter gradients (mean difference, 1.0 +/- 3.1 and 0.9 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, respectively).

Recombinant hirudin markedly reduced platelet and fibrinogen deposition in a dose-related manner and totally eliminated mural thrombosis at an APTT of two to three times that of control.

Platelet lysates induced a pronounced increase of plasma PAI type 1 messenger RNA (Northern blots) in aorta, liver, and myocardium. Anti-transforming growth factor beta neutralizing antibody markedly attenuated the plasma PAI increase. Concentrations in plasma of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were virtually unaffected under all conditions. Thus, platelet-associated growth factors and platelet lysates, shown previously to increase plasma PAI type 1 messenger RNA expression and protein production in cultured hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells in vitro, augment plasma PAI in vivo as well. Accordingly, activation of platelets and release of platelet-associated growth factors appear to contribute to the increased plasma PAI seen after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo quantification of myocardial muscarinic receptors has been obtained in six closed-chest dogs by using positron emission tomography. The dogs were injected with a trace amount of 11C-labeled methylquinuclidinyl benzilate (MQNB), a nonmetabolized antagonist of the muscarinic receptor. This was followed 30 minutes later by an injection of an excess of unlabeled MQNB (displacement experiment). Two additional injections of unlabeled MQNB with [11C]MQNB (coinjection experiment) and without [11C]MQNB (second displacement experiment) were administered after 70 and 120 minutes, respectively. This protocol allowed a separate evaluation of the quantity of available receptors (B'max) as well as the association and dissociation rate constants (k+1 and k-1) in each dog. The parameters were calculated by using a nonlinear mathematical model in regions of interest over the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. The average value of B'max was 42 +/- 11 pmol/ml tissue, the rate constants k+1, k-1, and Kd were 0.6 +/- 0.1 ml.pmol-1.min-1, 0.27 +/- 0.03 ml.pmol-1.min-1, and 0.49 +/- 0.14 pmol.ml-1, respectively, taking into account the MQNB reaction volume estimated to 0.15 ml/ml tissue. Although [11C]MQNB binding would appear irreversible, our findings indicate that the association of the antagonist is very rapid and that the dissociation is far from negligible. The dissociated ligand, however, has a high probability of rebinding to a free receptor site instead of escaping into the microcirculation. We deduce that the positron emission tomographic images obtained after injecting a trace amount of [11C]MQNB are more representative of blood flow than of receptor density or affinity. We also suggest a simplified protocol consisting of a tracer injection of [11C]MQNB and a second injection of an excess of cold MQNB, which is sufficient to measure B'max and Kd in humans.\r"

Generalized linear interactive modeling analysis using morphine dose, age, sex, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant medication as explanatory variables accounted for 70% of the variance in plasma concentrations of morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Increasing morphine dose was a significant factor for increased plasma concentrations of morphine, M3G, and M6G. Other significant factors were: age greater than 70 years (increased M3G and M6G plasma concentrations), plasma creatinine greater than 150 mumol/L (increased M3G and M6G plasma concentrations), male sex (decreased morphine and M6G plasma concentrations), raised creatinine plus coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants (increased M3G plasma concentrations), ranitidine (increased morphine plasma concentrations), and raised creatinine plus coadministration of ranitidine (increased M6G plasma concentrations).\r"

Peak serum concentrations were 278 +/- 233 ng/ml (oral) and 295 +/- 131 ng/ml (intravenous). After oral administration peak 5-hydroxy-propafenone levels were 194 +/- 65 ng/ml, whereas after intravenous dosing no metabolite was detected, except in one subject. Serum concentrations were related to effects by linear regression including a hypothetical effect-site compartment in a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Significant prolongations of ECG intervals were found in both sequences. Comparison of the two concentration-effect data sets (intravenous, oral) revealed an additive effect of 5-hydroxy-propafenone in four of eight subjects for PQ interval and seven of eight subjects for QRS duration. We conclude that 5-hydroxy-propafenone exerts pharmacologic activity and could thus contribute to the antiarrhythmic effect of propafenone.\r"

L1 reached maximum concentration in the serum 12 to 120 minutes after administration with 85% to 90% elimination within the first 5 to 6 hours, with a half-life of 47 to 134 minutes. L1 and its glucuronide metabolite were identified in serum and urine but not in feces. In most cases hydrolysis of 24-hour urine samples with use of beta-glucuronidase resulted in almost complete recovery of the administered dose. Urinary iron excretion was proportional to the iron load but not to the serum or urine concentration of L1. The therapeutic efficiency of L1 can therefore be improved by repeated administration of 2 to 3 gm doses at least every 6 hours.\r"

Cefepime concentrations in plasma, urine, and hemodialysate were assayed using reverse-phase HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Mean peak plasma concentrations of cefepime at the end of 30-minute infusion ranges from 63.5 to 73.9 micrograms/ml and were not affected by the degree of renal impairment. The half-life of cefepime was approximately 2.3 hours in subjects with normal kidney function; it increased proportionately as renal function decreased. Significant linear relationships between total body clearance and creatinine clearance, as well as renal clearance and creatinine clearance, were observed. The mean volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers was 20.5 liters and was not significantly altered in subjects with renal insufficiency. The mean cumulative urinary recovery of cefepime in healthy volunteers was 82.9% of the administered dose and significantly decreased in subjects with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min. Hemodialysis significantly shortened the elimination half-life from 13.5 hours during the predialysis period to 2.3 hours during the dialysis period. Cefepime dosage should be reduced in proportion to the decline in creatinine clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Some recent epidemiologic studies have reported a nonlinear dose-response in the relationship between coffee consumption and health risks, such that the risks increase disproportionately to the increase in dose. Assuming caffeine contributes to the adverse health effects of coffee, a possible explanation for the nonlinear dose-response relationship is dose-dependent metabolism of caffeine. We examined the hypothesis that under chronic dosing conditions the metabolism of caffeine is dose-dependent. Nine healthy subjects were given, in randomized 5-day treatment blocks, placebo, 4.2 (low) and 12 (high) mg/kg/day caffeine in decaffeinated coffee, in six divided doses spaced throughout the day. On the third day of each dosing period, 25 mg of stable-isotope labeled caffeine (2-13C, 1,3-15N2) was given intravenously. Clearance of labeled caffeine fell from 0.118 (placebo treatment) to 0.069 (low dose; p less than 0.005) and to 0.54 (high dose; p less than 0.001) L/hr/kg. The formation and metabolite clearances of paraxanthine, the major primary metabolite of caffeine, also decreased comparing the low and high doses (p less than 0.05). We conclude that caffeine metabolism is dose-dependent, resulting in nonlinear accumulation of methylxanthines in the body. Dose-dependent metabolism of caffeine may explain in part why people who drink large amounts of coffee are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease.\r"

Differences in susceptibility could involve metabolic activation of a protoxin, with affected patients having a greater converting ability. This possibility was investigated in 84 patients with scleroderma and 108 control subjects with in vivo probes of specific pathways of metabolism. Scleroderma was associated with reduced hydroxylating activity for dapsone and S-mephenytoin, whereas the ability to hydroxylate debrisoquin and N-acetyl dapsone was similar in both groups. Logistic regression confirmed these associations based on the shift in frequency distribution. Individuals who were poor metabolizers for mephenytoin and only modest N-hydroxylators of dapsone had a tenfold increased risk of scleroderma (p = 0.008). Thus this combined metabolic impairment may be causally involved in the development of scleroderma or, alternatively, the disease may produce inhibition of selected metabolizing enzymes in a subset of patients.\r"

Subjects inhaled the beta-agonists on an equal-weight basis (400 micrograms) at 0, 30, 40, and 45 minutes. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, total electromechanical systole (measure of inotropic activity), preejection period, QTc interval, plasma potassium levels, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were made 5 minutes after each dose and again at 60 and 75 minutes. There were no differences in the bronchodilating effect between the beta-agonists. However, both fenoterol and isoproterenol resulted in greater positive inotropic stimulation than did albuterol, and fenoterol caused a greater fall in plasma potassium levels than did the other beta-agonists.\r"

On the seventh treatment day, heart rate, blood pressure, systolic time intervals, and impedance cardiography were measured before the morning dose and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the morning dose. Heart rate and blood pressure were not markedly altered by any of the H2-receptor antagonists compared with the findings for placebo. Cimetidine and ranitidine did not markedly alter parameters of systolic time interval and impedance cardiography compared with placebo in contrast to famotidine, which significantly decreased stroke volume, cardiac output, and the Heather Index in impedance cardiography (p less than 0.05) and also significantly increased the ratio of the preejection period to the left ventricular ejection time in systolic time interval (p less than 0.05) 2 hours after the morning dose. Six hours after administration, most of these alterations could no longer be detected. The observed changes in hemodynamic parameters confirm that famotidine exerts negative effects on cardiac performance, whereas such influences could not be shown for cimetidine and ranitidine.\r"
