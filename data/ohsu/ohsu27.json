  ".W": "After injecting 125I- or 131I-labeled lipoproteins, plasma was subjected to discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, which separates low-density lipoproteins (LDL) into three subfractions. Analysis of changes in apolipoprotein B-specific activity with time showed that light LDL is normally the product of intermediate-density lipoprotein and the precursor of heavy LDL, which is subsequently converted to heavier LDL. In hyperapobetalipoproteinemia these relationships are maintained but there is overproduction of light and heavy LDL secondary to increased synthesis of very low-density lipoprotein. In familial hypercholesterolemia, light LDL is produced normally but its conversion into heavy LDL is reduced and independent synthesis of the latter is apparent. These observations suggest that the LDL receptor normally plays a role in the conversion of light into heavy LDL. They also provide an explanation for previously documented differences in LDL composition between hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, in which there is a relative increase in cholesterol-depleted heavy and heavier subfractions, and familial hypercholesterolemia, in which there is a relative increase in the cholesterol-enriched light subfraction.\r"

LPL activity toward monolayers containing 2 mol percent trioleoylglycerol was enhanced 2.6-fold by the addition of 5 mol percent cholesteryl oleate; cholesteryl ester had no effect on H-TGL activity.

An increase in hepatic triglyceride (TG) synthesis in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG) is associated with secretion of large, TG-enriched, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which have an increased affinity for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in vivo as compared with VLDL from subjects with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) or from normal subjects. Elevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoprotein B in FCHL are associated with high apoprotein B production rates. The LDL in FCHL is heterogeneous, with a preponderance of an LDL subfraction, which is denser, smaller, and lipid poor as compared with LDL from normal subjects. The more buoyant LDL subfraction in FCHL seems to be catabolized more rapidly than this dense LDL subfraction.\r"

High contents of cholestanol and low contents of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids predict the development of stroke in middle-aged men and are found in both middle-aged men with stroke and elderly patients with multi-infarct dementia. Young patients with unexpected stroke had normal serum sterol, triglyceride, and fatty acid contents but markedly reduced arachidonic acid levels in the platelets, a change that was normalized by treatment with aspirin.

No upper age limit was set for patient inclusion. The mortality rate increased abruptly in patients aged 75 years or older such that the 24 patients in that age group had a 10-fold higher in-hospital mortality rate (33% vs 3%) and 1-year mortality rate (42% vs 4%) than the 96 patients younger than 75 years. This increased mortality rate in the elderly patients was related to a 2-fold higher incidence of major hemorrhagic complications (24% vs 11%) and an increased incidence of anterior AMI, healed prior AMI, multiple-vessel coronary artery disease and extensive myocardial necrosis estimated by peak creatine kinase-MB. Hemorrhagic complications were more frequent in women than in men and in patients with diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension; all of these conditions were more prevalent in patients aged 75 years and older than in those younger than 75 years. In contrast, the incidence of hemorrhagic complications in nondiabetic elderly men (1 of 12) was similar to the incidence of bleeding in the patients younger than 75 years. Based on our data and those from other studies reporting no reduction in mortality in elderly patients with AMI who are treated with intravenous SK, it is recommended that patients aged 75 years or older should not be routinely treated with intravenous SK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three matched control subjects were chosen for each case from a series of 144 MVP patients without IE. Seventeen of the 19 cases (89%) had documented evidence of systolic murmurs existing before the IE episode; systolic murmurs were documented in 25 of the 57 control subjects (47%). The data indicate a significant increase in the risk of IE in MVP patients with a systolic murmur (p less than 0.01). The absolute probability of IE developing in a patient with MVP and a murmur was estimated to be approximately 1 in 1,400 per year; this was 35 times greater than the probability in a patient with MVP without a murmur. The results suggest that by restricting prophylaxis to MVP patients with a systolic murmur, cover would be provided for almost 90% of those with MVP in whom IE would be likely to develop.\r"

It has been suggested that the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae play an integral role in returning the valve to this position after initial diastolic opening. To determine whether such a model of mitral valve motion is valid in noninstrumented humans without underlying valvular disease, M-mode and Doppler ultrasound studies were performed in 6 subjects who underwent prolonged periods of ventricular diastole and atrial inactivity. After maximal opening, the mitral valve assumed a stable open position in which mean separation of the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets was 52% of maximal separation. This position was maintained for a mean duration of 585 ms, during which time transmitral flow fell to 0 m/s. Peak mitral valve opening preceded the early transmitral flow peak by an average of 42 ms, suggesting an active closure of the mitral valve as flow continued to accelerate. It is concluded that a semiopen equilibrium position of the mitral valve is assumed during prolonged diastolic periods in the absence of transmitral flow and is an accurate model describing diastolic mitral valve motion in noninstrumented humans. The chordae tendineae and papillary muscles may actively participate in the genesis and maintenance of the equilibrium position.\r"

In this study the diagnostic information content and classification performance of the ECG and VCG were examined using multivariate statistical techniques and a large validated data base of 3,266 cases. Logistic classification models were developed to differentiate between 7 diagnostic entities: normal (n = 538), left (n = 557), right (n = 323) and biventricular (n = 437) hypertrophy, and anterior (n = 390), inferior (n = 657) and combined (n = 364) myocardial infarction. The models were obtained from a learning sample (n = 2,446) using an optimal set of computer derived ECG and VCG measurements. They were subsequently applied to a test sample (n = 820). In the learning sample, the discrimination models resulted in a total correct classification rate of 69.6% for the ECG and 69.4% for the VCG. The total accuracy rate was slightly lower in the test set: 66.3% for the ECG and 67.1% for the VCG. The combined use of the best ECG and VCG variables did not increase total diagnostic accuracy. When cases with biventricular hypertrophy and combined infarction were deleted, accuracy rates of more than 80% were achieved for both lead systems. Differences in the classification rates for the subgroups were not statistically significant. Thus, the conventional 12-lead ECG is as good as the VCG for the differential diagnosis of 7 main entities, provided identical procedures are used in the design of the classifiers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four subjects underwent 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography during normal respiration and nonrespiration. Doppler recordings were integrated to determine mean temporal velocity (MTV) for each cardiac cycle separately. MTV during inspiration and expiration were compared, as were MTVs of 20 consecutive cycles during nonrespiration. Diameters of mitral and tricuspid orifice and interception angles were measured in 10 consecutive cycles at 4 predetermined moments. All results were averaged to a mean subject situation. MTVs were significantly (p less than 0.001) higher during expiration than during inspiration (12.4 and 11.0 cm-2) for the mitral orifice and lower (9.2 and 11.0 cm-2) for the tricuspid orifice. MTV at both orifices showed a significantly smaller variability (7.7% and 9.0%) during nonrespiration than during respiration (14.5% and 13.2%). Diameters of mitral orifice and tricuspid orifice were significantly (p less than 0.001) larger during diastole than during systole whereas standard error of the mean for both was 5.0%. Interception angles measured at mitral orifice are all close to 0 degrees and show minimal variability, while at the tricuspid orifice the angle varied from 15 degrees in diastole to 25.5 degrees in systole, constituting a significant difference in cosine (0.96 to 0.90).\r"

Peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity measured by pulsed Doppler echocardiography has also been proposed as a noninvasive method of assessing LV diastolic function. To determine if peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity also is influenced by LV size, 20 normal neonates (age 2 days) and 21 normal adults (mean age 38 years) were studied using pulsed Doppler echocardiography to measure mitral flow velocity and M-mode echocardiography to estimate LV end-diastolic volume and mitral valvular area. Peak early diastolic LV filling rate was calculated by multiplying peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity by mitral valvular area. Adults had significantly larger LV end-diastolic volumes (mean +/- standard deviation 108 +/- 25 vs 7 +/- 3 ml) and higher peak early diastolic LV filling rates (305 +/- 75 vs 29 +/- 10 ml/s) than neonates (both p less than 0.001). However, no significant difference was found in peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity between adults and neonates (61 +/- 10 vs 58 +/- 11 cm/s). These data suggest that peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity is independent of LV size. Since peak LV filling rate is equal to the product of peak mitral flow velocity and mitral valvular area, the correlation between peak early diastolic LV filling rate and LV size is probably due to differences in mitral valvular area rather than differences in peak mitral flow velocity.\r"

Presence of CAD was assessed by an angina questionnaire and from rest and exercise electrocardiograms. There was an apparent aggregation of premature CAD in 38% of the case families. A familial clustering of hyperlipoproteinemia was present in 58% of the case families and 15% of the control families. Systemic hypertension and cigarette smoking also were clustered in the case families. Multivariate statistical analyses of clinical and metabolic risk indicators in patients with and without a family history of CAD and in control subjects indicated that familial aggregation of CAD is independently related to MI at a young age. Degree and extent of coronary atheromatosis and number and severity of hemodynamically significant stenoses did not differ between young patients with and without a familial aggregation of CAD. The absence of a relation between the family history and severity of CAD implies that other underlying mechanisms are involved.\r"

There was close agreement between pulmonary artery and LV derived cardiac outputs (Pulmonary artery = 0.93 LV + 0.12). The pulmonary artery derived CO was 5.7 +/- 2.0 liters/min and the LV derived CO was 6.1 +/- 2.2 liter/min. Also, there was a close relation between pulmonary artery derived stroke volume (82 +/- 33 ml) and LV derived stroke volume (86 +/- 36 ml).

  ".W": "Gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent anatomic evaluation of the heart, but its capability for assessing cardiac physiology is less clear. Accordingly, regional left ventricular (LV) wall thickening was evaluated by multiphasic transverse images in 37 patients with a variety of myocardial diseases and in 9 normal subjects. Angiography and 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) were used for comparison. End-diastolic and end-systolic wall thickness, absolute systolic wall thickening and percent systolic wall thickening were determined in 7 regions. Mean systolic wall thickening in normal subjects was not significantly different among the regions. However, there was considerable individual variation in wall thickening, ranging from 18 to 100%. Patients with LV hypertrophy (n = 4), amyloid cardiomyopathy (n = 1), constrictive pericarditis (n = 5), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 3) had absolute and percent systolic wall thickening within normal limits. Infarcted segments in patients with ischemic heart disease (n = 17) had reduced absolute and percent systolic wall thickening, often combined with diastolic wall thinning, whereas mean percent systolic wall thickening in adjacent normal myocardial regions was higher than in normal volunteers (p less than 0.001). In patients with coronary artery disease, MRI had a sensitivity and specificity of 93% in detecting regional wall motion abnormalities. Because sagittal images were not acquired, inferior wall motion abnormalities were not assessed by MRI due to parallel wall sectioning in transverse images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six minutes after the initiation of infusion, there was a mean 9-beat/min increase in heart rate and a mean 12-mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure. The largest increase in heart rate exceeded 20 beats/min in only 13% of patients and the largest decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeded 20 mm Hg in 31%. Noncardiac side effects were headache (11%), lightheadedness or dizziness (5%) and nausea (4%). Only 9 patients required intravenous aminophylline for relief of noncardiac side effects: severe headache in 7 and nausea in 2. Cardiac side effects included chest pain in 76 patients (26%), of whom 70% were given aminophylline for relief of symptoms. Sixty patients (20%) had ischemic ST-segment depression and 56 (19%) had arrhythmias (ventricular in 50 and atrial in 6). There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions or sustained arrhythmias due to dipyridamole administration. Among 62 patients also undergoing cardiac catheterization, side effects except for arrhythmias were unrelated to the number of vessels with coronary artery disease. Intravenous dipyridamole is safe for nonexercise stress testing and has few serious side effects. However, the possibility of ischemia requires careful selection of patients and monitoring of vital signs and the electrocardiogram during the test.\r"

However, in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who undergo reperfusion therapy, monitoring ST-segment deviation could provide an early noninvasive indicator of coronary artery reocclusion. In this study, the admission 12-lead ECGs of patients with initial AMI were used to propose optimal lead locations for ST-segment monitoring. The study population was selected from consecutive Duke University Medical Center admissions during 1965 to 1981 who met the following inclusion criteria: chest pain for no more than 8 hours, initial AMI documented by ECG and 3 of 4 enzyme criteria, greater than or equal to 0.1 mV (1 mV = 10 mm) of ST elevation in at least 1 of the standard 12 leads (not aVR) on admission ECG, and no ECG evidence of conduction disturbances, ventricular hypertrophy or tachycardia. ST-segment deviation was quantified; AMI location was assigned based on the lead with maximal deviation. Of the 80 patients who had an inferior AMI, lead III was both the most frequent location for ST elevation (94%) and the most common site with maximal ST deviation. Lead V2 had the highest incidence of ST-segment depression (60%). In the 68 patients who had an anterior AMI, lead V2 had the highest frequency of ST elevation (99%). Leads V2 and V3 were the most common sites of maximal elevation. Thus, for monitoring ST deviation, leads III and V2 may be superior to leads II and V1, which are commonly used in arrhythmia monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen consecutive patients with healed MI assessed by biplane contrast ventriculography underwent MRI using oblique imaging planes. Seven normal subjects underwent MRI as controls. In each patient, ventriculography identified regional wall motion abnormalities. MRI, performed with a 0.15-Tesla resistive magnet and oblique imaging planes relating to the left ventricle, detected zones of regional wall thinning conforming to the wall motion abnormalities localized by ventriculography in 16 patients. In these patients, adjacent areas of intact myocardium were identified in areas shown by ventriculography to be normal. The left ventricular wall thickness at the site of MI was significantly less than adjacent noninfarcted myocardium (p less than 0.001) and normal hearts (p less than 10(-6)). The ratio of the thickness of the infarct to adjacent normal wall averaged 0.40 (range 0.22 to 0.62). MRI could differentiate healed MI from adjacent noninfarcted myocardium and normal hearts.\r"

No patient had had a previous myocardial infarction. High-fidelity LV pressure and volume were determined by angiography before and 20 and 50 seconds after the onset of transluminal coronary occlusion and soon after the last balloon inflation. Segmental wall motion was analyzed frame by frame along 20 hemiaxes. Global peak filling rate decreased significantly both after 20 (29%, p less than 0.05) and 50 seconds (27%, p less than 0.05) from the onset of the occlusion. The term sigma delta t1 was defined as the sum of the absolute values of the time differences from the occurrence of global peak filling rate and the segmental peak filling rate in 20 segments. This variable increased significantly during both periods of transluminal occlusion (by 73% and by 72% [both p less than 0.005], respectively), indicating asynchrony in the occurrence of regional peak filling rate. Simultaneously, the sum of intervals between aortic valve closure (end systole) and occurrence of peak segmental shortening, sigma delta t2, measured in the 20 segments, increased by 63% after 20 seconds and by 87% after 50 seconds (both p less than 0.005), showing major asynchrony in segmental contraction. A significant negative correlation was found between global peak filling rate and both sigma delta t1 and sigma delta t2 (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.70, p less than 0.0001, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two methods of measurement were compared. Mean stenosis before PTCA was 67 +/- 10% by the edge detection method and 67 +/- 12% by videodensitometry (difference not significant). After PTCA, the mean stenosis was 32 +/- 14% by edge detection and 30 +/- 13% by videodensitometry (difference not significant). In addition, a new method was developed to rapidly calculate the absolute minimum luminal area and diameter by videodensitometry. The minimum luminal diameter before PTCA was 1.0 +/- 0.5 mm and after PTCA increased to 2.4 +/- 0.5 mm (p less than 0.001). The validity of the videodensitometric method was analyzed in a series of Lucite phantom studies, which suggested that when there is an irregular angiographic appearance, the densitometric method may be more accurate than standard edge detection methods. Digital acquisition of coronary angiograms provides a means for rapid application of quantitative analysis during coronary interventional procedures.\r"

No patient took anti-ischemic medications and all patients underwent coronary angiography. A total of 1,154 hours (range 64 to 72 hours/patient) of high-quality AEM recordings was obtained. Silent ischemia (episodes of asymptomatic ischemic-type ST depression of 60 seconds or longer) occurred in 11 patients during daily activity detected by AEM. In 6 other patients, no myocardial ischemic episodes were found. But 1 of these patients withdrew after only 24 hours of AEM and the remaining 5 had no significant coronary artery disease (CAD). All 11 patients who had silent ischemia had significant CAD (at least 50% stenosis) on angiography. There was wide intrapatient variability in the frequency of silent ischemic episodes. Silent ischemia was identified in 6 of these 11 patients after 24 hours of AEM, in 2 after 48 hours and in 3 after 72 hours. Thus, asymptomatic men with positive exercise test responses and CAD have silent ischemic episodes during daily activity. AEM may be useful in helping to predict which patients with asymptomatic positive exercise test responses have CAD; however, extended AEM periods are required.\r"

Exercise thallium tests were ordered to obtain functional information (60%), to detect myocardial ischemia (29%), for routine follow-up (6%) and for screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) (5%). Exercise thallium testing was ordered instead of exercise electrocardiography alone because of an interest in assessing the size of an ischemic or infarcted area (37%), a belief that the exercise electrocardiogram was likely to be nondiagnostic (35%) or that exercise thallium was a better test (23%). In 20% of cases physicians said that thallium imaging results were helpful or pivotal in major management decisions, such as those regarding catheterization or surgery. In most cases, no further tests were ordered and antianginal therapy or activity prescription was changed after exercise thallium testing. Exercise thallium images also helped to stratify patients into low and high probability of CAD categories better than exercise electrocardiographic results alone did. Our data suggest that physicians are using exercise thallium testing to obtain functional information more often than simply to detect CAD and that physicians consider the test to be of considerable value.\r"

The purpose of this study was to verify these findings when the Q wave was analyzed in lead CC5 in 135 patients. The sensitivity for abnormal ST depression was 77%, specificity 83% and predictive value 78%. The corresponding values for the abnormal Q-wave response (reduction or no change in Q-wave amplitude) were 70%, 61% and 59%. These differences (except sensitivity) were significant. When either a positive ST or Q-wave response was used, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value did not significantly increase compared with the ST segment alone. In addition, only 45% of normal subjects with false-positive ST depression had a normal Q-wave response (increase) and 57% of patients with false-negative ST responses had an abnormal Q-wave response. When a positive response for CAD with an LAD lesion and for multivessel CAD with LAD narrowing was defined as having a Q-wave reduction, the sensitivities were extremely low (15% and 17%), but both the specificities and the predictive values were 100%. Therefore, the Q-wave analysis in lead CC5 is no more sensitive for detecting CAD than the ST-segment response. However, when a decreased Q-wave amplitude is observed, multivessel CAD and LAD narrowing can be predicted.\r"

Lack of pain was not correlated with age, gender, history of cigarette smoking, systemic hypertension, past acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, use of beta-blocking or calcium-channel blocking drugs, number of narrowed coronary arteries or average calculated ejection fraction at cardiac catheterization. Patients with painless myocardial ischemia were less often taking nitrates (39% vs 55%, p less than 0.05) and reported prior episodes of chest pain less often (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01) than control subjects. There was no difference in the frequency of painless myocardial ischemia between patients with and without diabetes mellitus (54% vs 47%). Duration of exercise was shorter in patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients who had pain with myocardial ischemia. No significant difference in age, gender, use of nitrates, beta-blocking or calcium-channel blocking drugs, history of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or cigarette smoking was found between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Systemic hypertension was more common in diabetic patients. Thus, painless myocardial ischemia is common in our patients with positive exercise tolerance test responses, but its frequency is similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.\r"

All patients in groups 1, 2 and 3 had significant CAD. The rate-pressure product on exercise stress testing was measured at 0.10 mV of ST-segment shift in patients with a positive response and at peak exercise in patients with a negative response. Rate-pressure product significantly separated group 1 and group 2 from each other (157 +/- 46 and 229 +/- 33 mm Hg X beats/min X 1/100, respectively, mean +/- standard deviation) and from group 3, group 4a and group 4b (284 +/- 40, 290 +/- 51, and 298 +/- 45 mm Hg X beats/min X 1/100); values in the 3 latter groups overlapped.2+ Thus, the dipyridamole-echo test can stratify groups of patients with different levels of ischemia threshold on effort.\r"

Visually- and mapping-guided endocardial ablation of 7 VT morphologic patterns was performed. Five of the 7 sites of VT origin were unresectable using standard resection techniques. Postoperatively, spontaneous and inducible VT was suppressed in all patients (without antiarrhythmic drugs in 4 patients and with a previously ineffective drug 1 patient). Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index and left ventricular ejection fraction were unchanged (p greater than 0.2) from preoperative values. Mean maximal creatinine kinase-MB isoenzyme concentration was 139 +/- 75 IU. All patients were New York Heart Association functional class II at discharge. During follow-up, no spontaneous arrhythmia has recurred in any patient. Thus, intraoperative argon laser ablation is effective for VT ablation alone or in conjunction with standard surgical resection techniques.\r"

For comparison, the same variables were reviewed for 62 consecutive patients who had transmural acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without cardiac arrest. The mean serum potassium level was lower after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (3.6 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter) than during AMI (3.9 +/- 0.5 mEq/liter) (p less than 0.005). The incidence of hypokalemia (potassium less than 3.5 mEq/liter) was greater in patients sustaining cardiac arrest (41%) than in patients who had AMI without cardiac arrest (11%) (p less than 0.001). Hypokalemia was common after cardiac arrest regardless of the occurrence of AMI at the time of arrest. Hypokalemia after cardiac arrest was independent of arterial pH, epinephrine or bicarbonate therapy during resuscitation, or prior therapy with diuretic drugs, digoxin or propranolol. In 10 patients with marked hypokalemia, the serum potassium level returned to normal rapidly (16 hours) during the hospitalization even though only 29% of the predicted potassium requirement was infused before its normalization. Thus, hypokalemia is prevalent immediately after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whereas it is uncommon in AMI in the absence of cardiac arrest. The cause and electrophysiologic consequences of this hypokalemia are unknown; in most cases, it is apparently caused by a shift of potassium from the intravascular compartment rather than a total body depletion of potassium.\r"

Hydralazine was given in an intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg and heart rate, blood pressure, sinoatrial conduction time (Narula method) and corrected sinus node recovery time were measured. The effect of hydralazine was also studied after total autonomic nervous system blockade using 0.04 mg/kg of atropine and 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol intravenously. In the control state hydralazine produced an increase of 28 +/- 15% (mean +/- standard deviation) in heart rate, and this was essentially due to a decrease in sinoatrial conduction time (by 32 +/- 32%, p less than 0.05). Corrected sinus node recovery time also tended to shorten (decrease of 21 +/- 34%, difference not significant). After total autonomic blockade intrinsic heart rate did not change or increased very little (9 +/- 14%) after administration of hydralazine and there was no consistent change in sinoatrial conduction and corrected sinus node recovery times. The small residual effect of hydralazine on heart rate was related to incomplete autonomic blockade, since the effect of postural change (standing) on heart rate was also not totally abolished. The study showed that the positive chronotropic effect of hydralazine was mainly due to a change in sinoatrial conduction with a smaller change in corrected sinus node recovery time, and the major chronotropic effect of the drug was mediated by the autonomic nervous system.\r"

The Holter session with the highest frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) and ventricular tachycardia was compared with the first placebo recording. Patients were segregated by their baseline frequency of VPCs. The percent of patients taking placebo in this trial who had the same increase in VPC frequency as has been ascribed to those with proarrhythmia varied from 0 of 470 patients with a baseline frequency of ventricular arrhythmia of 10 to 50 VPCs/hour, 3 of 44 (7%) with 51 to 100 VPCs/hour, 1 of 139 (0.7%) with 101 to 300 VPCs/hour and 1 of 265 (0.04%) with more than 300 VPCs/hour. Overall, 5 of 496 (1%) patients would have been classified as having proarrhythmia using the algorithm although only placebo was given. A 10-fold or greater increase in ventricular tachycardia beats in patients taking placebo occurred in 9 of 274 patients (3%). Thus, a simple algorithm to define proarrhythmia in patients with mixed cardiac disease and chronic ventricular arrhythmias can be defined and differentiated from spontaneous variability. This arbitrary algorithm defines proarrhythmia as an increase of more than 3 times when baseline VPC frequency is more than 100 VPCs/hour and more than 10 times when that frequency is less than 100 VPCs/hour with a false-positive rate of only 1%.\r"

Data obtained with the luminescent calcium indicator aequorin indicate that the calcium force curve is very steep in intact vascular smooth muscle cells; i.e., small changes in Ca++ can cause large changes in vascular tone. Therapeutic agents designed to directly decrease intrinsic myogenic tone could be designed to either decrease Ca++ or to decrease the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium.

  ".W": "Numerous studies have focused on functional vascular changes that characterize the hypertensive state. Recent evidence that suggests that increased vascular reactivity in hypertension is due to changes in the delivery of activator Ca++ through channels in the cell membrane will be reviewed. The primary evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from studies that characterize the effects of Ca++-free solution and calcium channel blockers on contractile properties of isolated vascular smooth muscle. In the present study, experiments were performed to investigate the role of Ca++ influx in vascular contractions produced by interventions that cause membrane depolarization. Isometric tension development in helical strips of carotid arteries from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats in response to elevated K+ and tetraethylammonium chloride was greater than that in carotid arteries from Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. The rate of tension development to K+-free solution in carotid arteries from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats was faster than in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rat arteries. Contractile responses to all 3 depolarizing interventions were reduced in arterial strips incubated in Ca++-free solution containing the chelator ethylene glycol bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and in arterial strips treated with the Ca++ channel blocker verapamil. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that constrictor stimuli that produce membrane depolarization cause an opening of Ca++ channels in the plasma membrane that are sensitive to the organic channel blockers. Further, a change in Ca++ permeability or membrane depolarizing mechanisms contributes to increased contractile responsiveness in carotid arteries of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

The data on the thyroid hormone's role include studies in which the synthesis rate of the 2 classes of heavy chains (alpha and beta) was compared with their respective messenger RNA levels. A close correlation was observed and is consistent with pretranslational control.

The effects of perfusion pressure per se on the renal vascular response of the rat kidney to diltiazem were evaluated using normal kidneys and hydronephrotic kidneys perfused extracorporally. In isolated perfused normal kidneys, diltiazem did not alter perfusate flow or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when administered at a perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg. In contrast, when diltiazem was administered at a perfusion pressure of 150 mm Hg, the calcium antagonists caused a striking increase in GFR, which was accompanied by an increase in renal perfusate flow. In the isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney, elevation of perfusion pressure was associated with an increase in renal vascular resistance and a reduction in afferent arteriolar diameter. Diltiazem abolished the pressure-induced constriction of afferent arterioles and caused an increase in renal perfusate flow in hydronephrotic kidneys perfused at pressures above 100 mm Hg. These findings suggest that in the setting of increased renal perfusion pressure, diltiazem's effects on GFR are mediated in part by an inhibition of pressure-induced constriction of the afferent arteriole.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of calcium channel modulators, a class of drugs that includes 3 chemical groups--1,4-dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines--has been extensively reviewed. The best known representatives of these 3 groups are nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem, respectively. These drugs bind reversibly, stereospecifically and with high affinity to both the membrane-bound and the purified receptor complex. Non-dihydropyridines allosterically regulate dihydropyridine binding. This has been shown by using (-) [3H]202-791 and (+) [3H]PN200-110 as labeled ligands. The purified receptor complex that possesses binding sites for all 3 chemical groups is likely to be related to the voltage-dependent calcium channel. As the result of a drug-receptor interaction, voltage-dependent calcium channels are either activated or inactivated. The drugs that activate channels act by promoting long-lasting channel openings. The drugs that inhibit calcium channels, the calcium entry-blocking agents, act by preventing channel openings upon membrane depolarization. A complex pharmacologic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular genetic approach is required to determine the molecular mechanism of action of calcium channel modulators. Clinically, calcium entry-blocking agents are recommended for the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension, posthemorrhagic cerebral vasospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, migraine and asthma and the protection of the ischemic myocardium.\r"

These include such modifiable factors as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking and hyperuricemia. Other factors that also increase risk are not modifiable and include advancing age, male gender and black race. The development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy imposes another significant risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Development of LV hypertrophy may be produced by hemodynamic as well as nonhemodynamic mechanisms. Included in the latter group are some of the same factors that in and of themselves participate in the production of increased LV mass (i.e., aging, gender and race, obesity, coronary disease, diabetes and the underlying mechanisms that subserve the hypertensive disease). This article discusses the concept, drawn from clinical and experimental studies, that demonstrate that the additional increased risk of LV hypertrophy may be ascribed to loss of reserve cardiac function, accelerated atherosclerosis, development of abnormal cardiac rhythm secondary to ischemia, fibrosis or drug-induced hypokalemia, inherent predisposition to ventricular dysrhythmias and sudden death, risks directly or coincidentally related to associated diseases or perhaps even the paradoxical risk of beneficial antihypertensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the physiologic rationale of their use in hypertension, traditional vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil are often relegated to the second and, more often, to the third and fourth steps of step-care programs. Although they are powerful blood pressure-lowering agents, they cause tachycardia, excessive renin stimulation and sodium retention, and cannot be used as the only antihypertensive agent. The characteristics of the antihypertensive action of calcium antagonists make them suitable for monotherapy. Indeed, all calcium antagonists, while effectively lowering blood pressure through vasodilation, either do not affect heart rate (verapamil and its analogs) or cause a moderate and transient heart rate increase (dihydropyridine compounds). Dihydropyridines also possess a natriuretic effect, probably due to inhibition of tubular sodium transport. The natriuretic effect is evident during the first 2 days of administration, but a small negative sodium balance persists for at least 1 week. There is no increase in body weight or fluid volumes with long-term administration of calcium antagonists with a marked acute natriuretic response, such as dihydropyridines, and those antagonists with a very moderate immediate natriuretic response, such as verapamil. All calcium antagonists, therefore, appear capable of preventing the sodium and water retention that vasodilatation would otherwise entail. More liberal step-care guidelines are now possible to find the agent most suitable for the individual patient. In these guidelines, calcium antagonists, as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are considered as possible first-choice agents along with diuretics and beta blockers.\r"

Calcium antagonists cause significant symptomatic improvement in both obstructive and nonobstructive forms and even in patients refractory to beta-blocker therapy. Exercise hemodynamics and exercise tolerance improve in the majority of patients during long-term therapy with calcium antagonists. Reduction in left ventricular (LV) outflow pressure gradient is not consistent after short- or long-term therapy. The provokable gradient tends to remain unchanged. The changes in LV outflow gradient do not appear to be contributory to symptomatic improvement. LV ejection fraction, mean normalized systolic ejection rate and end-systolic pressure volume ratio remain unchanged, suggesting that calcium antagonists agents do not alter LV systolic function. LV diastolic function and its relaxation properties, however, improve in many patients, which might be contributory to symptomatic improvement and improved exercise tolerance.\r"

Hemodynamic values and cardiac metabolism were studied during 2 pacing periods carried out before and after this dose (mean 5.3 mg). Postpacing ST-segment depression diminished (1 mm) after nicardipine administration (p less than 0.05), whereas pacing time to onset of angina did not change. Nicardipine administration increased heart rate 16% (p less than 0.005) and reduced systolic (10%) and diastolic (8%) blood pressures (both p less than 0.005). Coronary blood flow increased 16% (p less than 0.05) and coronary vascular resistance decreased 24% (p less than 0.01). Myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged despite an 11% decrease in rate-pressure product during pacing (p less than 0.02). In the control state before nicardipine administration, metabolic signs of ischemia included release of lactate across the heart in 7 patients, decreased mean free fatty acid and glutamate uptake and alanine release during pacing, together with increased glucose uptake and citrate release during recovery. After nicardipine lactate release decreased in 5 of the 7 patients, pacing no longer changed free fatty acid, glutamate and alanine uptake/release from the level at rest. During recovery glucose uptake was reduced and citrate release was unaffected. The hemodynamic data indicate that nicardipine is a systemic and coronary vasodilator, increasing oxygen supply to the ischemic myocardium. The metabolic results indicate a change in substrate utilization toward that of normal heart, suggesting improved aerobic energy supply.\r"

Transient regional wall motion abnormalities were observed in 11 patients. Angina and ST-segment changes occurred in 9 of these 11 patients with positive responses, but in none of those who showed no transient abnormality of regional wall motion. Localization of regional wall motion abnormalities correlated well with angiographic severity of coronary lesions. Endocardial area contraction, evaluated by a computerized system, was reduced significantly after dipyridamole administration in patients with a positive response (from 51 +/- 10% to 35 +/- 11%, p less than 0.001), whereas it did not change significantly in the others (from 43 +/- 6% to 42 +/- 8%). In the 11 patients with a positive response, coronary reserve assessed by exercise testing (modified Bruce protocol) was more impaired than in those with a negative response (time to 1 mm of ST depression 177 +/- 148 seconds and 472 +/- 179 seconds, respectively, p less than 0.01). In patients with severe angina and multivessel coronary artery disease, dipyridamole--2-D echocardiography appears to identify the vessel in which flow reserve is most limited. Although this information may be valuable, indications for the test are restricted to patients with severely limited exercise capacity.\r"

Patients trained for 6 months, 2 times per week for 30 minutes each. Results of the 2 groups after training showed similar significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) decreases in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (BP) and HR X BP product for trained legs and untrained arms at matched subanginal workloads and significant (p less than 0.01 to 0.001) increase in anginal threshold HR and HR X BP for the onset of 1 mm or more ST horizontal depression during testing of trained legs as well as of untrained arms. The improvement in exercise capacity at subanginal workloads results from decreased HR X BP product. In contrast, the significant increase in HR X BP product for the onset of ST-segment displacement and precipitation of anginal pain for both the trained and untrained limbs may imply an increase in myocardial blood flow. Thus, prolonged intensive or moderate training may significantly improve coronary blood flow in selected patients with angina pectoris. Patients with the highest anginal threshold HR and HR X BP product before training showed the most improvement at 6 months after training.\r"

The role of anticoagulation with heparin was evaluated in 75 consecutive patients who received intravenous streptokinase for AMI. Heparin therapy was titrated to keep the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) between 90 and 120 seconds. Seventeen episodes of definite myocardial ischemia (associated with reversible electrocardiographic changes) were observed in 13 patients. When episodes of probable myocardial ischemia are included (typical chest pain relieved by nitroglycerin or associated with more than a 15-mm Hg change in blood pressure but without electrocardiographic changes), 52 episodes occurred in 28 patients. Four episodes of definite and 4 of probable myocardial ischemia occurred within 24 hours of discontinuation of heparin. Analysis of the level of anticoagulation as assessed by PTT at the time of the ischemic events shows that ischemia occurred more often at lower PTTs. Nine hemorrhagic complications occurred, all within 24 hours of streptokinase infusion. In 4 patients bleeding was believed to be major and heparin administration was discontinued; 2 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding required blood transfusions. Our data suggest that after thrombolytic therapy for AMI, the level of anticoagulation is inversely related to the frequency of recurrent ischemic events; that discontinuation of heparin is frequently associated with ischemia; and that administration of heparin is associated with a low incidence of hemorrhagic complications.\r"

In 57% of patients in group 2 the CK level was doubled, with a characteristic enzyme curve, within the normal range, suggesting that an increase in CK had been missed because arbitrary definitions of \"normal\" were used. The median CK increase (60 IU/liter) in group 2 was greater than that in group 3 (23 IU/liter) (p less than 0.001). Patients in group 1 with small AMIs had a relative increase in CK similar to that in group 2.

The in-hospital and long-term prognoses of 667 patients with AMI complicated by cardiac arrest (CA) was compared with that of 2,596 AMI patients without CA. The incidence of CA complicating AMI was similar (21%) during each of the 4 study years. Among patients with AMI who had CA, 36% had CA within the first day of hospitalization and 48% within the first 2 days. The in-hospital case-fatality rate was much higher for AMI patients with CA (78%) than for those without CA (4%) (p less than 0.001). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, a trend toward a higher mortality rate was seen at 1 and 2 years after hospital discharge for patients with CA; however, long-term survival rates were not significantly different between AMI patients with and without CA. When time of occurrence of CA relative to in-hospital survival was examined, patients with early CA (within 1 day or within 2 days of hospital admission) had a significantly greater in-hospital survival (39% and 34%) than did those with late CA (after 1 day or after 2 days) (13% and 12%). Similarly, patients discharged from the hospital after early CA had a significantly better chance of long-term survival than patients discharged after late CA.\r"

To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 +/- 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that decreased HR variability correlates with increased sympathetic or decreased vagal tone, which may predispose to ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "Without revascularization, patients with non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are predisposed to angina, recurrent AMI and cardiac death. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 68 patients with angina an average of 2.3 months after non-Q-wave AMI (41 anterior, 27 inferior). Mean diameter stenosis was 95%, with collateralized total occlusion of the infarct-related artery in 23 patients. PTCA was successful in 87% (59 of 68), with a mean residual stenosis of 30%. One patient had emergency bypass surgery. Long-term follow-up (average 17 +/- 10 months) was available for 58 of the 59 patients in whom PTCA was successful. Recurrent angina developed in 41% (24 of 58), but was relieved by repeat PTCA in 14, by late coronary artery bypass surgery in 4 and by medical therapy in 6. There was 1 nonfatal AMI, due to progressive disease in a nondilated vessel, and 1 noncardiac death At last follow-up, 46 of 58 patients (79%) were asymptomatic and fully active or employed. Thus, patients undergoing PTCA for angina after non-Q-wave AMI appear to have a relatively high clinical restenosis rate, but with repeat PTCA have a low incidence of subsequent angina, AMI and cardiac death.\r"

Prognostic power was quantified in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves derived from logistic regression. In 1,451 patients with normal rest ECG findings, a clinical history alone provided the most prognostic power (area = 72%). This improved significantly (by 5%) only when both tests were analyzed. In contrast, clinical history had significantly less prognostic power in the 208 patients with abnormal rest ECG findings (area = 58%), but each test then provided a significant incremental improvement in these patients (by 14% for each). A strategic model was thereby developed for prognostic assessment that recognizes the incremental power of these tests in specific patient groups as well as their overall accuracy and monetary cost. This strategy stratified individual patient risk for subsequent coronary events over a full order of magnitude (from 2 to 22%) at a 64% reduction in the cost of testing compared to performing both stress tests in all patients.\r"

These patients did not have worsening of congestive heart failure or angina, coronary artery bypass surgery or spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the period between 2 PVS studies. During initial PVS, sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was inducible in 17 patients (group I) and was not inducible in 10 (group II). Late PVS in group I induced sustained VT or VF in 8 patients (47%) and nonsustained VT or no VT in 9 (53%). A decrease in late inducibility of sustained VT/VF was greater for arrhythmias induced during initial PVS by triple extrastimuli and burst pacing than for those induced by double extrastimuli (88% vs 25%, p less than 0.04), but appeared to be unrelated to the morphologic characteristics or cycle length of the initially induced sustained VT or VF and to other clinical, hemodynamic or angiographic variables. During late PVS in 10 group II patients, sustained VT or VF remained noninducible in 9 (90% concordance); in 1 patient sustained VT was induced. During a mean follow-up of 14 +/- 5 months since late PVS, none of 27 patients had spontaneous sustained VT and 2 patients in group I died suddenly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracardiac electrograms showed AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia in 40 patients and circus movement AV tachycardia in 60. The 12-lead electrocardiograms recorded during tachycardia were randomly sorted and reviewed by 4 experienced cardiac electrophysiologists who were blinded to the diagnosis associated with each tracing, the relative proportion of each arrhythmia and the hypotheses to be tested. Each reviewer was asked to indicate the location of the P wave relative to the QRS complex, electrical axis of the P wave in the frontal and horizontal planes and presence or absence of QRS alternation, and to interpret the most likely mechanism. The performance of published electrocardiographic criteria to differentiate AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia from circus movement AV tachycardia was evaluated. The overall accuracy of the reviewers' interpretations was 75%, similar to the accuracy of the predefined criteria when applied by these observers (71% correct, difference not significant). Interobserver agreement of reviewer interpretations was 76% and the intraobserver agreement was 78%. Features associated with circus movement AV tachycardia by univariable analysis were P waves after the QRS complex, faster tachycardia rates and QRS alternation. Multivariable analysis showed that only the location of the P wave relative to the QRS complex was independently associated with the mechanism of tachycardia (p = 0.002). QRS alternation was found by multivariate analysis to be associated with the rate but not the mechanism of the tachycardia.\r"

Anterograde and retrograde effective refractory periods of the accessory pathway did not change significantly from baseline during either i.v. or oral administration. Administration by either route prevented induction of sustained reentrant tachycardia in 8 patients. In 6 patients, the reentrant tachycardia was either nonsustained (2 patients) or sustained at much slower rates than the baseline rates (mean +/- standard deviation, baseline, 290 +/- 41 ms; i.v., 355 +/- 40 ms [p less than 0.001]; and oral, 377 +/- 33 ms [p less than 0.001]). In these patients anterograde atrioventricular conduction was prolonged significantly from the mean baseline value of 163 +/- 36 ms to 212 +/- 35 ms with i.v. administration (p less than 0.005) and 225 +/- 33 ms with oral administration (p less than 0.005).

Programmed electrical stimulation was performed in the control (drug-free) state, after infusion of intravenous nadolol (mean dose 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg/kg) and after chronic oral nadolol therapy in patients who responded to intravenous nadolol (mean dose 83 +/- 12 mg for 5 days). Intravenous nadolol administration prolonged mean sinus cycle length (p = 0.009), mean PR interval (p = 0.001) and mean AH interval (p = 0.001), with no significant electrophysiologic effects in the atrium, ventricle or accessory bypass tracts. Oral nadolol had similar electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic effects, but of lesser magnitude. Intravenous nadolol resulted in complete suppression of induced SVT in 78% of patients with sinus and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and 11% of patients with atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Partial responses were frequent in intraatrial or AV reentrant tachycardia (37%). Oral nadolol suppressed induction of SVT in patients who responded to intravenous nadolol. Adverse reactions to intravenous and oral nadolol were infrequent--6% and 8%, respectively--and usually did not require drug withdrawal. Intravenous nadolol is highly effective in sinus and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, and a successful electrophysiologic response to it predicts efficacy of long-term oral nadolol therapy. It has limited efficacy alone in AV reentrant tachycardia and should be considered in combination with other antiarrhythmic therapy in this type of SVT.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have established the feasibility of using balloon valvuloplasty to reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to a calcified aortic valve. The present study summarizes experiences with this technique in 9 patients (7 women, 2 men, mean age 78 years) in whom balloon valvuloplasty was used to treat calcific aortic stenosis. Peak aortic valve gradient (mm Hg) decreased from 68 +/- 8 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) before valvuloplasty to 35 +/- 5 after valvuloplasty (p = 0.003). Mean aortic valve gradient decreased from 57 +/- 7 before valvuloplasty to 30 +/- 5 after valvuloplasty (p = 0.006). Calculated aortic valve area increased from 0.42 +/- 0.04 to 0.81 +/- 0.06 cm2 (p = 0.005). Balloon valvuloplasty failed to diminish aortic valve obstruction in only 1 patient who, at subsequent surgery, had a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. Significant aortic regurgitation was not observed in any of the 9 patients after valvuloplasty. One patient did have a highly focal, presumably embolic, brain stem infarct during the procedure. Femoral arterial blood loss, related to wire-guided exchange of balloon catheters too large for a 12Fr introducer sheath, was minimized by direct arterial exposure in 8 of the 9 patients. Thus, these findings confirm the efficacy of balloon valvuloplasty for the treatment of calcific aortic stenosis. The procedure, however, is not without hazard.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary reports indicate that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is efficacious for treatment of mitral stenosis. The present study was designed to evaluate whether anatomic features of stenotic mitral valves in older adults affect the efficacy of balloon valvuloplasty and to determine the mechanism by which increased orifice area is accomplished. Fifteen mitral valves excised intact at the time of mitral valve replacement from patients with no more than 2+/4+ mitral a regurgitation were selected for study. Balloon valvuloplasty was performed using a sequence of dilation catheters with balloons 18 to 25 mm in inflated diameter. Mitral valve area, measured with a conical valve sizer, increased from 0.71 +/- 0.06 cm2 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 1.77 +/- 0.19 cm2 (p less than 0.0001) after valvuloplasty, resulting in an increase in calculated orifice area of 185 +/- 27% (range 34 to 407%). The increase in calculated orifice area correlated inversely with orifice area before valvuloplasty (r = -0.57; p = 0.026), but was unrelated to extent of calcific deposits on the prevalvuloplasty x-ray of the excised mitral valve. Gross examination together with x-ray analysis after valvuloplasty revealed that the mechanism of balloon valvuloplasty in each case involved commissural splitting, including splits through heavily calcified commissures, without grossly apparent detachment of tissue fragments. These findings suggest that balloon valvuloplasty augments the functional mitral valve orifice area in a manner analogous to standard surgical commissurotomy, and balloon valvuloplasty is likely to be efficacious for a wide spectrum of adult mitral valvular stenosis, including severe stenosis with extensive calcific deposits.\r"

Qualitative methods assigned etiologic diagnoses by matching patterns of calcium with anatomic criteria. Quantitative techniques measured echodensities from superimposed short-axis views of calcium. Fifty-five pathologic specimens procured from surgery were photographed and radiographed. Etiologic diagnoses were assigned from gross examination and radiodensities were planimetered. Echocardiographic and anatomic diagnoses were compared. Sensitivities for diagnosing the most common etiologies, congenitally bicuspid and degenerative, were 58% and 100% and specificities were 100% and 76%. Calcium tended to be heaviest in congenitally diseased valves and lightest in those with degenerative disease (p less than 0.2) and showed propensity for the right cusp in all etiologies except for those with degenerative disease. Correlation of echodensities to radiodensities was 0.82. The relation of calcific echodensities to orifice area was curvilinear; beyond a level of calcium, further deposits did not reduce the orifice more. A systematic echocardiographic examination of calcium in stenotic aortic valves can give a correct etiologic diagnosis in most patients and identify the severely narrowed orifice.\r"

In patients with AS, orifice area determined by transesophageal echocardiography was 0.75 +/- 0.34 cm2 and that calculated with Gorlin's formula was 0.75 +/- 0.32 cm2. In normal aortic valves, orifice area was 3.9 +/- 1.2 cm2 by transesophageal echocardiography. A good correlation was demonstrated between aortic valve orifice area determined using transesophageal echocardiography and calculated orifice area using Gorlin's formula in patients with AS: r = 0.92, standard error of estimate = 0.14 cm2. The absolute difference between orifice area measured with both methods ranged from 0.0 to 0.4 cm2 (mean 0.09 +/- 0.1). In 4 patients orifice area could not be determined with transesophageal echocardiography. The orifice could not be identified in 2 patients because an appropriate cross-sectional view of the aortic valve could not be achieved and in 2 patients with pinhole stenosis (aortic valve orifice area 0.3 cm2). These data show that aortic valve orifice area can be measured reliably using 2-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography.\r"

Isolated AS was noted in 21 patients and combined AS and aortic regurgitation in 6. Thirteen patients had more than 50% diameter stenosis in 1 or more coronary arteries on angiography. Eleven of them had reversible perfusion defects on post-stress thallium scans (sensitivity 85%). Two patients had thallium defects without angiographic evidence of significant CAD (specificity 86%). In the other 12 patients with normal coronary angiographic findings, the thallium scans were normal. Two patients had dizziness and hypotension after dipyridamole infusion, which disappeared during the handgrip test; 2 others had chest pain during handgrip. One of them was treated with aminophylline and the other with aminophylline and nitroglycerin. No other adverse effects were reported by the patients and no major complications occurred during stress testing. Thus, thallium imaging during combined intravenous dipyridamole and handgrip test appears to be a promising noninvasive method of revealing CAD in patients with AS.\r"

All patients were symptomatic and all had clinically severe isolated mitral regurgitation (MR). The origin of MR was myxomatous degeneration, coronary artery disease, rheumatic heart disease or congestive cardiomyopathy. In 20 patients ring anuloplasty was performed using the Carpentier ring and 1 patient using the Duran ring. Postoperative Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed to detect and semiquantitate residual MR by flow mapping and to identify left ventricular inflow or outflow obstruction. The severity of MR was assessed by flow mapping in the left atrium and graded from I to IV in increasing severity. Blood flow velocity spectra were recorded from the left ventricular outflow tract during systole and from the left ventricle subjacent to the mitral valve during diastole. Pressure half-time, mitral valve area and mitral valve gradient were derived from digitized mitral diastolic flow velocity spectra. After ring valvuloplasty, 9 patients had no MR and 6 had grade I, 3 grade II, 2 grade III and 1 patient grade IV MR. Peak diastolic mitral valve gradient was 8 +/- 4 mm Hg, mean diastolic gradient was 3 +/- 2 mm Hg and pressure half-time was 83 +/- 17 ms, representing a calculated mean mitral valve area of 2.9 +/- 0.8 cm. Peak velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract was 0.9 +/- 0.2 m/s, indicating no obstruction to outflow. Our study confirms that mitral ring valvuloplasty produces a significant reduction in severity of MR, and this is achieved without obstructing left ventricular inflow or outflow.\r"

The present study was designed to compare the antihypertensive effects of a beta-blocking drug, propranolol, with a calcium channel-blocking drug, diltiazem, at rest and during upright bicycle exercise and to determine whether exercise capacity is altered by these therapies. Twenty-one patients with uncomplicated systemic hypertension and a diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 95 to 110 mm Hg without medication were randomly assigned to propranolol or diltiazem therapy in a double-blind manner. The total daily dosages were titrated as needed, from 160 to 480 mg of propranolol (mean 371 mg) and 120 to 360 mg of diltiazem (mean 307 mg) over 12 weeks, and the titrated dose was maintained for 4 additional weeks. Both drugs significantly reduced supine BP (from 149 +/- 14/101 +/- 4 to 136 +/- 17/89 +/- 10 mm Hg with propranolol and from 157 +/- 14/103 +/- 4 to 144 +/- 13/93 +/- 8 with diltiazem. Only diltiazem reduced BP during submaximal exercise, but both agents produced significant responses during maximal exercise. Diltiazem had no effect on maximal heart rate, exercise duration or O2 uptake, whereas propranolol reduced maximal VO2 from 27 +/- 6 to 22 +/- 6 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.01) and also shortened duration of exercise. Propranolol, despite its effects on heart rate, maintained the workload VO2 relation at submaximal loads, suggesting an increased oxygen delivery. However, these adaptive mechanisms appear to be insufficient during maximal effort.\r"

Proteinuria could not be correlated with serum creatinine level, and in 28% of the patients with renovascular hypertension, proteinuria was present despite a normal creatinine level.

LV function at rest was similar in the 2 groups, but with exercise hypertensive patients had a greater end-systolic volume (69 +/- 19 vs 51 +/- 19 ml, p less than 0.002) and lower ejection fraction (EF) (0.59 +/- 0.09 vs 0.72 +/- 0.07, p less than 0.0001), stroke volume (101 +/- 28 vs 130 +/- 36 ml, p less than 0.005) and peak oxygen uptake (23 +/- 7 vs 33 +/- 9 ml/kl/min, p less than 0.05).

Increased atrial septal thickness was present in 60% of amyloid patients and no controls. The combination of increased myocardial echogenicity and increased atrial thickness was 60% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. The ratio of electrocardiographic voltage (S in V1 + R in V5 or V6) to left ventricular cross-sectional area also was examined. A ratio of less than 1.5 was 82% sensitive and 83% specific for amyloid (excluding the 2 patients with left bundle branch block), but added little to the diagnosis as determined from the 2-dimensional echocardiogram.\r"

The DSS was visualized by 2-dimensional echocardiography and cineangiography. Six patients had a thin discrete \"membrane\" immediately below the aortic valve (group I) and 4 patients had a thicker fibromuscular ring about 1 cm below the aortic valve (group II). In group I, the mean gradient decreased from 82 +/- 49 mm Hg (range 35 to 164) to 22 +/- 15 mm Hg (range 5 to 40); in group II, it decreased from 155 +/- 18 mm Hg (range 132 to 177) to 85 +/- 44 mm Hg (range 60 to 150). Three patients had follow-up cardiac catheterization 1 year later. Their mean gradient soon after the procedure was 37 +/- 23 mm Hg. On follow-up, it was still 37 +/- 19 mm Hg, indicating persistence of relief of the obstruction. Because of the high residual gradient in group II, 3 patients had surgical relief of the obstruction. The degree of aortic regurgitation present before the dilatation in all 10 patients did not change after the procedure. The mechanism of relief of the obstruction was by tearing of the subaortic membrane. Our data suggest that relief of subaortic obstruction is more favorable in the thin, membranous DSS.\r"

In group II, no patient died early and 3 died late. In addition, many patients required prolonged digoxin therapy. Because the arterial switch operation has a high early mortality risk and an undetermined long-term morbidity and mortality risk, the Senning operation (or other venous switch operations) is considered the preferred surgical approach for simple TGA. In contrast, an arterial switch operation is performed in patients with complex TGA (without subpulmonic obstruction). Comparison of the early and late morbidity and mortality of the arterial vs the venous switch operation may be helpful in selecting the appropriate surgical approach to complex TGA.\r"

  ".W": "Obstructed pulmonary venous drainage is generally considered extremely rare with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) to the coronary sinus (CS). A retrospective review of 27 operated patients with TAPVC to CS revealed 6 cases of obstruction (22%). Two of 6 patients who died early had evidence of obstruction at the pulmonary vein confluence at autopsy. Among the 21 hospital survivors, obstruction proximal to the point of CS unroofing developed in 4 (19%), necessitating reoperation and resulting in death in 3. One other patient died late. Mean follow-up of the 17 long-term survivors, who are generally doing well, is 85 months (range 2 to 212). There have been no cases of late obstruction at the site of unroofing among 10 patients who underwent the fenestration procedure suggested by Van Praagh. The incidence of early bradyarrhythmias (60%) does not appear to be decreased by this procedure. Review of 13 autopsy specimens suggests that if the right and left pulmonary veins did not drain directly to the CS but converged to form a short common vertical vein (4 cases), obstruction was likely. When pulmonary artery pressure approaches systemic levels preoperatively, careful echocardiographic and intraoperative assessment of the junction of the pulmonary vein confluence with the CS should be made. If there is evidence of obstruction, consideration should be given to anastomosing the horizontal right and left pulmonary veins directly to the left atrium rather than performing a simple unroofing procedure.\r"

Right ventricular to coronary artery fistulous connections were found in more than 60% of the cases. All patients with fistulous connections had histologic abnormalities of the coronary arteries. In 50% the lesions were mild, with medial and intimal thickening producing up to moderate luminal stenosis. In 50% there was loss of normal arterial wall structure and severe narrowing or obliteration of the arterial lumen. The coronary arterial fistulas and histologic abnormalities were prevalent in those with underdevelopment of the tricuspid valve and right ventricular cavity but were not found in patients with a normal or dilated tricuspid valve anulus. The coronary arterial abnormalities were found in more than 80% of patients with a tricuspid valve/mitral valve ratio less than 1. A single coronary artery occurred in 6 patients (17%) of this series. In 80% of those with 1 coronary artery arising from the other, the aberrantly arising coronary artery crossed anteriorly to the pulmonary artery and could be at risk in surgical attempts to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow. Aortography is recommended if the coronary arteries are not clearly delineated on ventricular cineangiocardiography.\r"

  ".W": "The pathologic anatomic features and associated cardiac anomalies of 13 patients with aorticopulmonary septal defect (APSD) and of 236 previously reported cases were analyzed. Morphologically, 3 types of APSD were distinguished: a defect with a more or less circular border located about halfway between the arterial valves and the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk; a similarly located defect in which the border represents a helix; and a usually large defect in which there is no posterior (distal) border. The appearance of these 3 types of defects suggests a different developmental mechanism for each. Approximately half of the cases of APSD are not associated with other cardiovascular anomalies. Of the anomalies that do occur, anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk and interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) type A or severe preductal coarctation are seen far more often than expected. An association with DiGeorge syndrome, frequently noted with persistent truncus arteriosus (TA) and IAA type B, was not seen. Certain cardiac anomalies often seen with TA are rarely seen with APSD, and defects often seen with APSD are rarely seen with TA. These observations indicate that APSD and TA are pathogenetically unrelated even though located in the same region of the heart and, unlike TA and IAA type B, APSD is probably not due to a developmental error involving the neural crest.\r"

Forty-four patients were studied, 10 before surgery (mean age 6.9 years) and 34 after repair (mean age 8.1 years, mean age at surgery 6.5 years, mean interval between surgery and evaluation 11 months). Evaluation was performed by means of body surface and intracavitary signal-averaging techniques, by recording local right ventricular (RV) electrograms at several sites and by 24-hour Holter monitoring (n = 28). No electrophysiologic abnormality was observed in children before surgery. Ventricular late potentials were detected in 18 patients (53%) after repair. Body surface detection of ventricular late potentials was frequently masked by the postoperative right bundle branch block pattern. Local RV electrograms were fractionated in 11 cases (32%) (mean duration 103 +/- 33 ms), most often in the RV outflow tract (n = 9), but no relation was found between fragmentation of RV electrograms and the presence of ventricular late potentials. Spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 12 children after repair (43%), but were complex in only 4 patients (14%). There was no correlation between spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and the presence of ventricular late potentials, presence of fractionated RV electrograms, presence of a proximal right bundle branch block or postoperative hemodynamic status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The surgical mortality rate was 13% when patients with hypoplastic left or right ventricle (n = 6), double-orifice mitral valve or extreme deficiency of mitral tissue (n = 5), and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (n = 5) were excluded. Of the 49 patients who survived operation, 36 are in New York Heart Association class I, 1 patient requires a pacemaker and 3 died late. In 34 of the 51 patients (28%) who did not undergo operation, pulmonary vascular obstructive disease developed; it occurred within 12 months in 10 patients (8%). Eight other patients who did not undergo operation died before planned surgery (age 1 to 9 months). Although surgical prognosis in good candidates is acceptable, the overall prognosis for children with complete AV canal is guarded because of the risk of early death or early pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and frequently unfavorable anatomy.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 8 studies involving 3,996 offspring of parents who have congenital heart disease revealed that the risk for all defects was substantially higher if the affected parent was the mother rather than the father. The risk ratio ranged from a high of 6.39 for aortic stenosis to a low of 1.48 for patent ductus arteriosus, and the ratio was statistically significant in aortic stenosis (p = 0.025) and ventricular septal defect (p less than 0.001). Despite the relatively large number of cases, there were still too few patients to reveal statistical significance for a malformation such as atrioventricular canal, in which there were 5 affected offspring among 36 children of mothers who had atrioventricular canal and no affected children among 16 offspring of affected fathers (p = 0.12). The possible reasons for the preponderance of affected offspring of mothers with a congenital heart disease was studied in the context of various modes of inheritance and maternal physiology. The preliminary conclusion is that although many familial cases of congenital heart disease are compatible with multifactorial inheritance and vulnerability to teratogens, an important subset of cases, particularly in some high-risk families, may be better explained by cytoplasmic inheritance than by multifactorial or mendelian modes. Current genetic counseling should take into account the differences in risk to offspring of affected mothers while confirmation and further investigation proceeds.\r"

Transmitral maximal velocity, transtricuspid maximal velocity, transaortic maximal velocity and transpulmonary maximal velocity correlated well with gestational age. The ratio of transtricuspid maximal velocity/transmitral maximal velocity was at least 1 in 44 of 45 fetuses (97.8%). In the ratio of transpulmonary maximal velocity/transaortic maximal velocity, the characteristic change was not evident. Therefore, continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonographic measurement of fetal intracardiac blood flow velocity waveforms in utero can aid in analyzing the physiologic circulatory hemodynamics.\r"

The frequent coexistence of obesity with systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease further complicates evaluation of cardiac function in obese persons. Therefore, cardiac mechanics and contractile function were examined at cardiac catheterization in 14 obese persons (50 +/- 5% overweight) who were free of systemic hypertension and angiographic coronary narrowing. Twelve lean subjects who underwent catheterization for chest pain, found to be free of cardiac abnormalities, served as control subjects. Preload, estimated as end-diastolic stress, was greater in obese persons (48 +/- 5 kdynes/cm2) than in lean persons (32 +/- 3 kdynes/cm2) (p less than 0.01). Afterload, estimated by end-systolic stress, was also greater in obese persons: 124 +/- 15 kdynes/cm2 vs 95 +/- 6 kdynes/cm2 (p less than 0.05). Ejection fraction was similar in obese (0.69 +/- 0.02) and lean persons (0.71 +/- 0.02). Mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and the ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index were also similar in both groups. The value for stress velocity of fiber shortening relation fell within the range of the normal subjects in all but 1 obese subject. Thus, although abnormalities in loading conditions are present in normotensive persons who are moderately obese, contractile function is usually normal.\r"

The patients were hyperglycemic, VLDL triglycerides levels were higher, and HDL cholesterol levels lower than corresponding findings in control subjects. Bile acid formation and biliary lipid composition did not differ between the two groups, but net steroid balance in the patients was elevated by a factor of approximately 2. A switch from diet A to diet B in control subjects was associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol and decreases in bile acid synthesis and net steroid balance. Lipoprotein pattern in the patients remained unchanged, and effects on total bile acid production and steroid balance were less consistent. It is suggested that the response in the patients reflected diabetes-associated abnormalities in lipid metabolism.\r"

Regardless of the treatment the potato had received, greater than 90% of NSP was recovered in ileostomy effluent. Starch from freshly cooked potato was well digested, only 3% being recovered; however, 12% from cooked and cooled potato escaped digestion in the small intestine. Digestibility of starch made resistant to alpha-amylase by cooling improved on reheating. Overall, 9, 18, and 14% of total carbohydrate fed was recovered from freshly cooked, cooled, and reheated potato, respectively. Digestibility of cooled potato was identical when eaten as large lumps or as finely sieved potato. In vitro studies with pancreatin also demonstrated incomplete digestion of cooled potato.\r"

To extend these findings, we measured balances of calcium, phosphorus, and fat from the 5th to 10th day after surgery and serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol on the 10th day after surgery in this experimental model. We found steatorrhea in the resected group, but balances of calcium and phosphorus and serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were the same in resected and control groups. We conclude that decreased transport defined by direct examination of membrane function may be undetectable when net transport is measured by balance. Calcium balance during early post-resection period provides no evidence for future calcium deficiency in this experimental model.\r"

The pattern of individual phospholipids of RBCs in the Finnish and Italian samples differed from the American samples. In all plasma and RBC glycerolphospholipids, the monounsaturated fatty acids were highest in the Italian and the saturated fatty acids were highest in the Finnish samples; PUFAs were highest in the USA samples.

Mean circulating levels of vitamin C and alpha-tocopherol were normal and equal in case and control men, but serum retinol was raised and beta-carotene was reduced in case men. Serum concentration and 24-h urinary excretion of selenium were significantly lower in case than in control men. Serum levels of magnesium and zinc were similar in both groups, but urinary excretions were higher in case men. Heavy drinking does not result in florid nutritional deficiencies in socially intact men, but its role in subtle nutritional alterations deserves further studies.\r"

No significant associations between serum selenium. vitamin A, vitamin E, and CVD mortality were observed before and after multivariate analyses. The adjusted risk of death from CVD for subjects in the lowest selenium quintile (less than 105.0 micrograms/L) was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8-3.2). For coronary and stroke death risk, estimates were 1.1 (95% CI, 0.5-2.6) and 3.2 (95% CI, 0.8-12.1). Our findings do not show a clear CVD risk from low selenium and vitamin levels.

Magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, fiber, vegetable protein, starch, vitamin C, and vitamin D intakes were significant variables that showed inverse associations with blood pressure in univariate and a multivariate analyses. Magnesium had the strongest association with blood pressure, which supports recent interest in its relation to blood pressure. Nevertheless, it was not possible to separate the effect of magnesium from that of other variables because of the problem of high intercorrelation among many nutrients. While recommendations based upon cross-sectional studies must be viewed cautiously, these results suggest that foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy items are major sources of nutrients that may be protective against hypertension.\r"

Stool samples from infants consuming fortified milk or nonfortified milk were ashed, and ashes were diluted in hydrochloric acid and reacted with bathophenantroline disulphonate. Mean iron excretion per subject was obtained. Anemia was present in 25.7% of infants in the nonfortified group (upper level of 95% confidence limit for mean iron excretion was 14.9 mg iron/100 g stool) and in 22.2% of infants from the noncompliant fortified group (mean excretion less than 15 mg iron/100 g stool). In contrast, only 0.8% of infants who had properly consumed the fortified milk had anemia. We conclude that this method for determination of stool iron should be considered for estimating compliance in evaluation of results of field trials of iron-fortified products in infants.\r"

  ".U": "87124610\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred seven mucinous breast carcinomas were morphologically classified into two different groups: pure mucinous carcinomas consisting only of areas with small epithelial islands of solid tumor floating in abundant extracellular mucin, and mixed carcinomas where the tumor contains large areas of mucin, as well as areas with infiltrating carcinoma devoid of extracellular mucin. Of the 207 tumors, 95 were of the pure type and 112 of the mixed type. The pure and mixed carcinomas differed significantly with respect to a number of prognostic factors, the most important of which was lymph node status. Patients with pure mucinous carcinomas had significantly fewer lymph node metastases at the time of primary operation (P = 0.0001) and a significantly longer recurrence-free survival (P = 0.03) than patients with mixed carcinomas. Patients with mixed carcinomas closely resembled patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (NOS) with respect to both lymph node status and recurrence-free survival. In multivariate analysis, the single most important factor for predicting recurrence-free survival among the 207 patients was lymph node status. However, of 94 pure carcinomas, only 6 had lymph node metastases at the time of mastectomy. A detailed morphologic analysis demonstrated that two of these six cases were incorrectly diagnosed as being pure mucinous carcinomas--they were actually of the mixed type. In another two of these cases, the metastases originated from a co-existent infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Thus, metastases to the regional lymph nodes were observed in only two cases of pure mucinous carcinomas. It is concluded that the biologic behavior of the pure mucinous carcinomas differs from that of both the mixed carcinomas and infiltrating ductal carcinomas NOS. Thus, a new definition is suggested, in which a mucinous carcinoma is classified as such only if it is a pure carcinoma, and mixed mucinous carcinomas are classified according to the component without extracellular mucin production.\r"

Bone marrow biopsies and marrow smears were examined separately and then compared for the following parameters: percentage of blasts, dyserythropoiesis, ring sideroblasts, dysmegakaryopoiesis, dysgranulopoiesis, monocytes, cellularity, fibrosis, and \"abnormal localization of immature precursors\". The results of the histologic (biopsies) and cytologic (marrow smears) examinations were in good agreement in 24 of 28 cases. The authors' results suggest that the five MDS types proposed by the FAB group can be reliably distinguished on bone marrow biopsy with knowledge of the peripheral blood blast and monocyte counts. When the bone marrow aspiration is inadequate, the biopsy can establish diagnosis and type of MDS and rules out aplasia or tumor infiltration as possible alternative causes of cytopenia.\r"

In the group as a whole, a mild depression in the hemoglobin concentration and mean cell volume (MCV) was associated with an increase in the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and platelet count. Bone marrow trephine biopsies and further measurements of iron status and disease activity were done in [a further] 38 more anemic patients, and the findings in those with absent marrow iron (iron deficiency) were compared with those having stainable stores (anemia of chronic disorders). The RDW was raised in both, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. The concentrations of nonheme iron in the marrow and of serum ferritin were significantly lower in the iron-deficient group, but the geometric mean serum ferritin of 34 micrograms/L was still a good deal higher than that associated with uncomplicated iron deficiency. This was presumably because of the fact that the serum ferritin, which was significantly correlated with the ESR (r 0.55; P less than 0.0004) and C-reactive protein (CRP) r 0.41; P less than 0.01), was also functioning as an acute phase protein. While there was a weak correlation (r 0.37; P less than 0.04) between the marrow nonheme iron and the serum ferritin concentrations, it disappeared when nonactive patients with normal CRP concentrations were excluded. The absence of a correlation is unlike the findings that have previously been noted in other chronic inflammatory conditions and in neoplasia. This raises the possibility that serum ferritin concentrations in rheumatoid arthritis may reflect, in part at least, another store of iron located in affected joints.\r"

Loss of this excess through enzymatic breakdown of the free protamine leads to instability of the complexes with liberation of the heparin, reestablishing antithrombin activity. This \"heparin rebound\" can also be produced by an increase in heparin levels or increased amounts of antithrombin III. These phenomena could occur after extracorporeal bypass procedures by an increase in heparin from whatever source or by added antithrombin III, through transfusions of fresh frozen plasma. A larger excess of protamine does not itself act as an anticoagulant but produces large heparin-protamine complexes that can still activate antithrombin III. Such large complexes, formed in vivo, could possibly block the pulmonary microcirculation and cause the acute pulmonary hypertension that has been reported after protamine infusions.\r"

Addition of hemolysate to plasma containing low concentrations of platelets, simulating that obtained from thrombocytopenic patients, caused more striking elevations in apparent PAIgG. Centrifugation of platelet-rich plasma containing hemolysate through a 30% solution of Percoll restored the value of PAIgG essentially to normal. Additional studies using simulated patient whole blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA yielded similar results. The apparent elevation of PAIgG in these preparations appears to result from IgG-bearing membranous material and microspherocytes that co-isolate with platelets separated from blood by conventional methods. Caution should be used in interpreting the results of PAIgG measurements on platelets isolated from blood samples in which even minimal in vitro hemolysis has occurred.\r"

To determine the correlation of FIA with standard assay methods, RF and CRP levels were measured by both methods in 151 patients with active RA. RF levels measured by FIA correlated very closely with charcoal agglutination method (r2 = 0.890, P less than 0.0001). CRP levels by FIA correlated very closely with CRP levels by nephelometric method (r2 = 0.886, P less than 0.0001) and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) (r2 = 0.356, P less than 0.0001). A weak statistical correlation of RF, CRP, and ESR with some clinical variables of RA disease activity was demonstrated. Measurement of RF and CRP by FIA is similar to standard methods and offers no specific advantages in evaluating RA patients at a single evaluation.\r"

Based on the findings, the most suitable pregnancy test reagent kit was then selected for doing routine pregnancy testing of urine samples of premenopausal patients. The less sensitive PregnaSTICK ELISA method and Concept RIA procedure did not give any positive results. Positive results for postmenopausal female and male urine samples were obtained as follows: Testpack, 2 and 0 (greater than 50 mIU/mL [IU/L]); Icon, 2 and 0 (greater than 50 mIU/mL [IU/L]); Quest, 4 and 2 (greater than 50 mIU/mL [IU/L]); Nimbus, 17 and 4 (greater than 25 mIU/mL [IU/L]); and Sensi-Chrome, 33 and 19 (greater than 50 mIU/mL [IU/L]), respectively. The medical records of the patients whose urine samples gave positive results were examined for information that would have explained the positive results, but no clear-cut reasons were found. Comparison of the routine urinalysis findings showed that there was a correlation between the mucus content of female (but not of male) urine samples and the incidence of false positive human chorionic gonadotropin results. During 12 months of routine use of the Icon reagents for pregnancy testing of premenopausal urine samples, the University of Texas Medical Branch staff has not reported any suspected false positive findings to the authors.\r"

The authors studied cytologic material before the diagnosis was made of cervical squamous cell carcinoma in situ in 25 patients. Twenty-two (88%) of the 25 patients showed koilocytosis compared with only 6 out of 57 (10.5%) in the control group. The findings of this study support a possible predisposing role of papillomavirus in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of tissue-specific enolase isoenzymes may be of assistance in identifying small cell carcinomas of the lung and in distinguishing them from other pulmonary tumors. Enolase (E.C. 4.2.1.11) is a dimeric enzyme composed of various permutations of three immunologically distinct subunits alpha, beta, and gamma. Five isoenzymes alpha alpha, beta beta, gamma gamma, alpha beta, and alpha gamma have been identified. Immunohistochemical studies using antibodies to the gamma subunit have localized alpha gamma and gamma gamma specifically within neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues. Because of this limited distribution, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) can function as a biochemical marker for neuroendocrine tumors. The authors developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the double antibody sandwich method. The sandwich is composed of rabbit antirat enolase that cross-reacts to the human gamma monomer, making the test specific for the gamma gamma isoenzyme. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex system is used to provide increased assay sensitivity. Serum samples from patients with histologically diagnosed small cell carcinoma have concentration of NSE 20- to 30-fold greater than that found in normal serum. Studies were conducted on patients with a variety of malignant pulmonary lesions and compared with controls to determine the value of NSE as a tumor marker.\r"

Standard antibody detection procedures were done with the use of a selected red blood cell panel. No unexpected alloantibodies were detected. These findings suggest, at a 99% confidence level, that neonates do not make red blood cell alloantibodies in response to transfusion, indicating that repeated compatibility testing is probably unnecessary. Thus, following initial antibody screening and compatibility tests, further compatibility testing can be eliminated.\r"

The incidence of overall reaction was 0.3% of all transfused units, which is significantly lower than other studies. Febrile nonhemolytic reactions and allergic urticarial reactions were the most frequently noted, constituting 51.3% and 36.7%, respectively, of total reactions. There were only 17 hemolytic reactions (four immediate and 13 delayed-type). The incidence of delayed hemolytic reactions in cancer patients is significantly lower than that reported for patients in non-oncology hospital settings. This could result from the inability of cancer patients to produce alloantibodies against blood group antigens as frequently and efficiently as can those with non-neoplastic conditions.\r"

Varying specific factors in given tests indicated that discordant results were significantly reduced by (1) dispensing sera in trays centrally rather than locally; (2) using a standard one-wash procedure rather than local or three-wash methods; and (3) using reagent (monospecific) rather than patient (polyspecific) sera. Use of standard versus local rabbit complement did not significantly influence the concordance of results.\r"

A solid phase passive hemagglutination test (SP-PHA) was developed for this purpose and compared with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) used in PHA and SP-PHA was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Human IgM was captured to a microtiter plate coated with anti-human IgM, and the presence of anti-HBc IgM was demonstrated by the adherence of HBcAg-sensitized erythrocytes to the bottom of a U-shaped microtiter plate. ELISA and SP-PHA were made at 1:100 and 1:1,000 serum dilution, respectively. Both were positive in 100% of 36 cases of acute hepatitis B, 68.18% of 22 cases of chronic hepatitis B, and 20% of 75 healthy carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but none in 65 anti-HBc-positive blood donors that had negative results for HBsAg. Results of both tests were identical but were false positive because rheumatoid factor was found only in ELISA. End-point titration by SP-PHA and PHA was also found useful for the differentiation of acute hepatitis B from chronic hepatitis B and HBsAg carriers.\r"

Monitoring is a form of surveillance consisting of repeated testing intended to detect a specified change in a patient indicating a change in his prognosis, need for treatment or need for a change in treatment. The concept of monitoring overlaps with those of screening and diagnosis. One may monitor a physiologic or pathologic process, a therapeutic or noxious agent, comparing results with the patient's previous results or with a group reference range. Pertinent questions include: what are the indications, what is to be monitored, which tests are to be used, when to start, how frequently to test, when to stop. Preliminary improvement of monitoring protocols may be achieved by applying common sense guidelines for medical decision making; using best estimates of test characteristics, of possible risks and benefits of testing, not testing, treating and not treating. Sensitivity analysis may help determine when further clinical research is needed.\r"

Between April 1 and Oct 1, 1983, 520 children presented to the Emergency Department of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with trauma related to two-wheeled nonmotorized bicycles. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 18 years (mean, 8.7 years), and most (72%) were males. Most accidents (84%) occurred less than five blocks from home, and 49% occurred in the street. Thirty-six percent of the patients admitted to stunt riding or going too fast when the accident occurred, and 36% claimed there was a problem with the surface on which they were riding. The accidents occurred when a patient lost control of the bike (45%), a patient on a bicycle was hit by a car (17%), or a pedestrian was hit by a bicyclist (10%). Only three patients were wearing protective equipment at the time of the accident. Most (54%) had received no specific safety instructions about bicycling. The extremities were injured in 53% of the accidents, but head and neck injuries accounted for 31%. Six percent required hospital admission. Males and children over 12 years of age were more likely to have multiple injuries. Accidents that occurred in the street or involved cars were associated with a greater number of serious and multiple injuries. The infrequent use of protective equipment and minimal safety instructions received by the patients in this study suggest that many bicycle-related injuries are preventable. Education of parents and children is recommended to improve bicycle safety.\r"

No differences were observed in premature infants with and without apnea. It may be speculated that the increased endogenous release of beta-endorphins in response to perinatal asphyxia may play a role in the pathogenesis of shock observed in the first day of life.\r"

Data were abstracted from maternal and infant medical records in 184 cases of neonatal death occurring between January 1982 and October 1984. The overall consent rate for neonatal autopsy was 72%. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression found previous fetal loss, gestational age, and cause of death to be significantly different between the groups of consenters and nonconsenters. Parents least likely to consent to autopsy were those who had no history of previous fetal loss, who had pregnancies in which the birth weight of the infant was less than 1000 g or the gestational age was less than 28 weeks, or those who had an infant die of extreme prematurity. Factors not significantly associated with consent were maternal age, race, marital status, transfer status, type of prenatal care, the infant's sex, and the staff position of the requester. A second phase of the study surveyed physicians' attitudes regarding the importance of neonatal autopsy. The staff position and previous experience of the physician-requester, in addition to the presumed cause of the infant's death, were significantly associated with the rating assigned to the importance of the autopsy. These findings suggest that the mother's past and present obstetrical experience, the presence of extreme prematurity, and possibly the attitude and experience of the physician requesting autopsy permission may exert important influences on the likelihood of obtaining consent for a neonatal autopsy.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and laboratory features of 86 infants admitted with diarrhea and dehydration were evaluated prospectively. Human rotavirus (HRV) infection was documented in 35 infants (41%) by the Rotazyme test. Those with HRV gastroenteritis (HRV+ group) had a shorter duration of diarrhea prior to admission, more severe dehydration on presentation, and a longer hospital course than the HRV-negative (HRV-) group. Vomiting, fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, otitis media, and cough were present in equal numbers of infants in both groups. The HRV+ infants had lower serum bicarbonate and higher serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and uric acid concentrations than did the HRV- infants. Serum uric acid levels greater than 10 mg/dL (590 mumol/L) were present in 69% of HRV+ vs 29% of HRV- infants. The Rotazyme test was found to be a valuable tool in diagnosis; testing on two days increased the yield from 74% to 97% of all infants finally diagnosed as HRV+. The optimal time for testing was within the first five days of illness.\r"

The presence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus did not alter the incidence of NEC. Of a large number of perinatal events and conditions considered, only BW and maternal toxemia were found to be associated with the rate of NEC, both relating inversely. Thus, these data do not support a relationship between NEC and a variety of perinatal factors previously postulated as potential determinants of the disorder.\r"

At a methadone hydrochloride maintenance program providing medical care to drug-dependent women and their infants, ophthalmologic examinations of all infants born during a 36-month period were performed. Twenty-nine infants prenatally exposed to psychoactive drugs were seen at birth and on follow-up. The 24% prevalence of strabismus found in the drug-exposed infants was significantly greater than that of 2.8% to 5.3% reported in the general population.

  ".W": "It is reported that very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants with the complication of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at high risk for metabolic bone disease and growth retardation. In a prospective study, we compared growth and bone mineral content (BMC) during the first year of life in 16 VLBW infants with BPD and 16 VLBW control infants. The BPD and control groups were matched for gestational age (28.2 +/- 0.8 vs 28.4 +/- 1.2 weeks) and birth weight (986 +/- 158 vs 1037 +/- 147 g). Calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and energy intakes did not differ during the initial 60-day period of hospitalization. At 1 year of age, there were no significant differences in BMC (104.4 +/- 21.4 vs 109.7 +/- 19.2 mg/cm), weight (7440 +/- 1090 vs 7420 +/- 826 g), length (66.9 +/- 3.4 vs 67.7 +/- 3.0 cm), or head circumference (45.1 +/- 1.5 vs 44.0 +/- 1.0 cm) between BPD and control groups. In both groups bone mineralization was delayed compared to the intrauterine curve for BMC. Growth was also delayed compared to the growth curves of Babson for premature infants during the first year of life. We conclude that for our study population, factors other than the presence or absence of BPD are responsible for marked delays in bone mineralization and growth in VLBW premature infants.\r"

Twenty-five children (1.2%) had x-ray evidence of a cervical spine injury, with a male to female ratio of 4:1. Vehicular accidents accounted for 36% of cervical spine radiographic abnormalities, and sports or playground accidents accounted for an additional 36%. In an attempt to find clinical predictors that might identify x-ray abnormalities, we reviewed the medical records of these 25 children with abnormalities and 713 randomly selected children without x-ray evidence of cervical spine injuries for the following: method of injury, presenting complaints, physical examination findings, therapy, and complications. No single clinical predictor had a sensitivity of 100% when considered in isolation, but clinical assessment consisting of EITHER a complaint of neck pain OR involvement in a vehicular accident with head trauma would have correctly identified all 25 cases of cervical spine injury. If this information had been used prospectively, the number of cervical spine radiographs ordered would have been reduced by 32%. We conclude that the use of this clinical \"marker\" would have positively identified all children with cervical spine injuries and would have reduced by one third the cost and radiation exposure associated with cervical spine radiographs. Because of the serious consequences of missing a cervical spine injury, we suggest that other studies confirm these results before this information is accepted as a recommendation.\r"

Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; they were the only organisms isolated in two patients (14%) and were mixed with aerobes in 12 patients (86%). There were 78 anaerobic isolates (5.6 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. There were 26 aerobic isolates (1.9 per specimen). The predominant aerobes were alpha- and gamma-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus species, and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. beta-Lactamase production was noted in 16 isolates recovered from ten patients (71%). These included all isolates of S aureus, six of 18 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (33%), and two of three Bacteroides oralis (67%). These findings demonstrate the major role of anaerobic organisms in retropharyngeal abscesses and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of those who developed coronary artery aneurysms and group B consisted of those who did not. The patients who developed aneurysms had a significantly longer duration of fever and a significantly lower minimum hemoglobin concentration than those who did not develop aneurysm. In patients who developed aneurysms, aspirin therapy was begun significantly later in the course of the illness compared with those who did not develop aneurysms. We suggest that the timing of the initiation of aspirin therapy may be important in the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms in patients with Kawasaki disease. We believe that it may be important to establish the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease as early as possible and to institute aspirin therapy at an appropriate dosage.\r"

Serum specimens were obtained 12 times during a 17-year period. The initial geometric mean titer of the rubella HI antibody was higher in the children than in their mothers, but the titer declined more rapidly in the children. After 17 years it was 2(5.4) in the children and 2(6.9) in the mothers. In 13 (3.4%) of the children, the rubella HI antibody titer reverted to negativity after three to 17 years.

The association of Turner syndrome with HLH, as well as other known genetic etiologies of HLH, underscores the need for a detailed genetic evaluation in all patients with HLH and argues for cytogenetic analysis for even nondysmorphic females with HLH.\r"

The correct diagnosis was made within the first 24 hours of presentation in 11 patients (55%); 19 patients (95%) were correctly diagnosed within one week. The incidence of major complications was 45% (9/20); however, in patients with a delay in diagnosis of over 24 hours the complication rate was 67% (6/9).

Infections of the central nervous system (n = 56), lower respiratory tract (n = 53), and genitourinary tract (n = 46) made up 70% of all infections. Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) was the most commonly isolated pathogen. Staphylococcus aureus (20%) and Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (18.3%) were most commonly noted in PICU-acquired infections. Twenty infected patients (11.1%) died in the PICU. Lower respiratory tract infections (20.5%) were associated with the highest mortality. Both PICU-acquired and community-acquired infections were associated with similar mortalities. Infected patients in a PICU have a mortality approximately 300% higher than that seen in the overall PICU population. The data presented document the importance of infection and provide information against which similar units can gauge their infection status for quality-assurance purposes.\r"

The incidence of King's syndrome is uncertain as all reported cases were first recognized following an episode of MH. We report a case of King's syndrome without the cryptorchidism and pectus carinatum associated with the syndrome. King's syndrome's possible link to Noonan's syndrome is discussed herein, and the diagnosis and management of MH are briefly reviewed. We recommend evaluation for MH susceptibility in all patients with clinical signs consistent with King's syndrome and in their family members prior to anesthesia.\r"

This general injury rate was similar to incidence figures from a non-day-care center injury study. This lack of improvement in injury rates in licensed day care is of concern and deserves increased attention from pediatricians.\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of this study were to examine the response of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to indomethacin, using serial two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies, and to correlate the response to treatment with serum indomethacin levels. Nineteen preterm infants (gestational age, 26 to 31 weeks [mean, 28 weeks]; weight, 600 to 1680 g [mean, 1060 g]) were treated with indomethacin. Two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were obtained before administration of indomethacin and daily thereafter until the day after the last dose. Ductal responses to treatment were graded as open, constricted, or closed, and serum indomethacin levels were obtained 24 hours after the last dose. The PDA initially closed in 11 (58%) of 19 infants; however, in four of the 11, PDA reopened and three of four required surgical ligation. In seven (37%) of 19 patients, the PDA initially constricted, but five of seven subsequently reopened and required ligation. In one patient, indomethacin had no effect on the PDA. The mean indomethacin level for the whole group was 622 ng/mL. There was no difference in indomethacin level between the group with initial closure vs those with constriction (580 vs 590 ng/mL), nor between those who eventually required ligation and those who did not. This study demonstrates that the majority of premature infants respond to indomethacin treatment with ductal constriction or closure but that reopening occurs frequently. The initial response does not mean that the ductus will remain constricted or closed, and surgical intervention may still be necessary. A serum indomethacin level of more than 250 ng/mL does not ensure ductal closure.\r"

Most primary care practitioners do not have enough experience to evaluate and manage their problems efficiently. We reviewed the medical care of the foreign-born adoptees followed up in a single pediatric group practice. The 128 children arrived from one of eight countries in Asia or Latin America at ages ranging from 1 month to 10 years; 57% were female. The median duration of follow-up was 20 months. The most common problems identified included deficient immunizations (37%), intestinal parasites (29%), emotional or behavioral problems (22%), skin diseases (16%), estimated age (12%), scabies and/or lice (10%), and congenital anomales (10%). Twenty-one other classes of problems were identified, including developmental delay, lactose intolerance, vision and hearing deficits, and chronic hepatitis B carrier status. At arrival or within one month, 49% of the children had acute infectious diseases, including upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, rubeola, varicella, and mumps. Nineteen percent of the children underwent surgical procedures ranging from circumcision to cleft lip-palate repair; 46% of these children were never screened for hepatitis B. Fourteen percent were hospitalized at least once, 5% within the first month after arrival. We developed a simple protocol to screen foreign-born adopted children, allowing rapid identification of treatable problems at the least cost and inconvenience to the family. Thirty-six percent of the families made at least one preadoption visit, permitting an explanation of the protocol and potential problems before the child's arrival.\r"

Roentgenographic evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) developed in 24 (75%) of 32 CMV-infected infants, an incidence significantly greater than that observed in control infants (12/32; 38%). Infants with acquired CMV infection required more respiratory support and longer hospitalization than uninfected controls. This association between acquired CMV infection in premature infants and the development of chronic lung disease provides further evidence that vigorous efforts to prevent CMV infection in hospitalized neonates is warranted.\r"

The area under the dose-response curve was computed. Histograms of the carbachol reactivity showed a bimodal distribution: 10% of normal subjects and 50% of nonasthmatic parents had values in the asthmatic range. In 85% of parent couples at least one of the two parents had bronchial reactivity without being asthmatic. Our findings suggest that bronchial reactivity to a cholinergic bronchoconstrictor indicates an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance.\r"

Twelve patients had chronic heartburn, 10 had nocturnal cough and wheezing, eight had chest pain, and one was asymptomatic for GER. GER was determined by a combination of esophagoscopy with biopsy, manometry, and esophageal pH testing. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 13 months to 5 yr. Six patients were completely free of all wheezing episodes, six still had wheezing but the frequency and severity had markedly decreased, and one remained unchanged. Of 11 patients who required chronic bronchodilator therapy, four were able to completely stop and six decreased the dose by more than half; one required the same amount of therapy. Of the seven corticosteroid-dependent patients, two were weaned completely, three were being tapered, one remained unchanged, and one required a smaller dose for nasal polyps although he was free of wheezing and had stopped bronchodilators. Three patients, all of whom dramatically improved after surgery, died during their follow-up course: one died suddenly 8 months postoperatively during a walk after dinner from apparent status asthmaticus; one died 9 months postoperatively of refractory congestive heart failure; and one died 30 months postoperatively of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown source. We conclude that surgical correction of GER in selected adults with both asthma and GER may significantly decrease or eliminate pulmonary symptoms and the need for asthmatic medications.\r"

Postoperative studies showed the stones with the central signals to be of the so-called mixed stone type, in which the central area consists of cholesterol with a radiating structure. The central signal was thought to originate in water that accumulates in the central cavity of the stone, the cavity not being isolated from the exterior of the stone and there being a passage of fluids. The central signal is a characteristic indication of the stone's structure.\r"

These 25 patients were initially treated conservatively (nasogastric tube/rectal tube/enemas) and this was successful in eight of 25 patients (32%). The remaining 17 patients (68%) unresponsive to conservative therapy received endoscopic intervention, either colonoscopic suction decompression (CSD) or colonic suction decompression with proximal colonic tube placement (CDT) for continuous decompression. Of the endoscopic procedures performed, 13/17 (76%) resulted in successful acute decompression. Recurrences occurred in 6/13 (45%) (3/7 in the colonoscopic suction decompression group and three of six in the colonic tube placement group). In the 10 failures, six further procedures were attempted, but only one was successful. These patients were then treated conservatively. There were no instances of colonic perforation. Acute pseudoobstruction in our experience is a benign entity that can be safely and successfully treated nonsurgically. Colonoscopic suction decompression is often initially successful but has a high frequency of recurrence. Newer techniques to prevent recurrence, i.e., colonic tube placement, are of potential benefit but presently have technical problems.\r"

Preoperative symptoms and assessment are described including use of power spectrum analysis of heart rate fluctuations which was consistent with enhanced parasympathetic stimulation. After surgical repair of hiatal hernia and fundoplication, bradycardia resolved, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms subsided, and the power spectrum analysis of heart rate confirmed decreased parasympathetic influence. Power spectrum analysis proved to be a useful adjunct in confirming preoperative autonomic imbalance and assessing the postoperative result. It is concluded that in individuals with disorders such as familial dysautonomia that are associated with autonomic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias may be a sign of esophageal pathology. Thus, cardiac evaluations should be accompanied by investigation of gastroesophageal structure and function and appropriate treatment may prevent a catastrophic arrhythmia.\r"

Complications of this abuse have included psychotic reactions, acute pulmonary insufficiency, convulsions, and various infections. We have observed three patients in whom the IV use of these agents was associated with the nephrotic syndrome and renal histopathologic findings similar to that reported in heroin addicts with the so-called \"heroin-associated nephropathy.\" Percutaneous renal biopsy demonstrated focal to diffuse segmental or global glomerulosclerosis by light microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed glomerular visceral epithelial cell foot process effacement and microvillus formation. Immunofluorescent studies were negative in the two patients studied. One patient presented in renal failure, and two others progressed to renal failure within 3 years of diagnosis. We suggest the term opiate nephropathy for this lesion in narcotics users, indicating its potential occurrence in non-heroin-using drug addicts.\r"

  ".W": "IgA nephropathy is currently considered an immune complex (IC) disease. However, though several groups have demonstrated the presence of IgA-IC in the sera of patients by various techniques, a correlation with clinical activity of the nephropathy has not always been found. Since these assays detect (simultaneously) polymeric and monomeric IgA-IC, the pathogenicity of these two classes of complexes could not be established. In this work, we have studied in 66 patients with IgA nephropathy the existence and significance of such IC, by means of a technique described in our laboratory, based on the specific binding of secretory component for polymeric IgA. Furthermore, IgG-ICs were also determined by the standard Raji cell assay in ELISA. The prevalence of these complexes was as follows: Multimeric (polymeric and monomeric) IgA-ICs were detected in 55% of 66 patients studied, polymeric IgA-ICs in 30%, monomeric IgA-ICs in 39%, and IgG-ICs in 46%. The intermittency of all these complexes was clearly noted in sequential examinations. A significant correlation (P less than .025) with hematuria was only found with polymeric IgA-IC, but not with multimeric IgA-IC, monomeric IgA-IC, or IgG-IC. Polymeric IgA-ICs were more frequently observed at the initial phases of the disease. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that polymeric IgA-IC was of larger size than monomeric IgA-IC. The major pathogenicity of polymeric IgA-IC is in agreement with the finding of this immunoglobulin at the mesangial level in patients and animals with IgA nephropathy.\r"

Three of these patients have remained independent of dialysis up to 4 years, and one patient returned to dialysis 1 month following discontinuation. Although glomerular pathology was variable in the four patients, a lesion common to all at presentation was acute tubular necrosis.

In addition, a subset of patients had repeat studies more than 12 months after PTx. In patients with I as well as with II HPTH, mean +/- SEM fasting serum concentrations of total triglycerides (TG) (1.51 +/- 0.09 and 2.17 +/- 0.19 mmol/L, respectively) were significantly increased when compared with that of 22 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (1.01 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, P less than .001). No consistent anomalies of serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol content were observed in Io HPTH patients. In uremic II HPTH patients, the cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly (P less than .01) depressed, compared with normal subjects. In the short term, PTx normalized serum total TGs (P less than .001) in Io HPTH patients from 1.50 +/- 0.11 to 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol/L seven days after PTx. The surgical correction of II HPTH in dialysis patients was also followed by an improvement of hypertriglyceridemia from 2.22 +/- 0.21 to 1.46 +/- 0.08 mmol/L and 1.46 +/- 0.09 mmol/L seven and 14 days, respectively, after PTx (P less than .01). Long-term follow-up after PTx shows clearly a persistent decrease in serum TG concentration in I HPTH patients (1.17 +/- 0.11 mmol/L), as well as in II HPTH patients (1.61 +/- 0.18 mmol/L), 12 months after PTx by comparison with values determined before PTx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had a pathologic bone histology; in 69.0%, a mixed form with predominant osteitis fibrosa and concomitant osteoidosis. In 30.1%, we found pure hyperosteoidosis, nearly half of these cases showing osseous aluminum deposits. Hyperosteoidosis was much more frequent in women (35.7%) than in men (20.9%), although the prescribed intake of aluminum-containing phosphate binders was the same. It is possible that female hemodialysis patients were more prone to aluminum accumulation or that they had a better compliance in taking the aluminum hydroxide. Serum parameters alone were not very helpful in predicting the underlying bone disease. Mean iPTH concentrations tended to be lower in the patients with hyperosteoidosis than in those with the mixed lesion, but there was wide variation. Serum aluminum was only predictive for aluminum deposits in the bone when concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/L.\r"

Discontinuation of therapy with the latter two agents and induction of a brisk diuresis with intravenous (IV) fluid therapy resulted in return of renal function concomitant with spontaneous clot passage. A review of previous literature suggests that hemophiliacs may be more susceptible than nonhemophiliacs to high-grade urinary obstruction due to clot formation when epsilon-aminocaproic acid is administered during episodes of hematuria. Acute flank pain, fever, and delayed dense nephrograms on IV pyelogram are characteristic of the syndrome and distinguish it from other forms of acute renal failure associated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid.\r"

This had been characterized by nonoliguric renal failure after a long latent period (weeks) following exposure to the drug. Pathologic data have indicated a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. We report here one case of oliguric acute renal failure after a massive Dyazide intoxication. Based on the results of the renal biopsy and clinical course, we propose that the oliguria was secondary to a direct toxic effect on the tubules, and intrarenal obstruction was secondary to triamterene crystals and crystal-laden cells. In addition, pathologic findings also suggested a moderate hypersensitivity reaction. After hemodialysis and short-term steroid therapy, the patient achieved complete recovery of renal function within 12 days. Recent knowledge of triamterene-induced nephrolithiasis helps to explain the pathogenesis of acute renal failure in this patient, and is briefly reviewed here.\r"

Our results indicate the relationship definitely does exist, confirming studies that have shown a relationship based on positive staining for cancer antigens in kidney biopsy specimens. In addition, the study indicates that malignancy will become detectable within a relatively short period after the diagnosis of membranous glomerulonephritis, and that the malignancy rate is five times greater than the incidence in a baseline population. This risk is also highest in the elderly.\r"

Hyperplastic polyps were not detected in eight cases, seven of which had no evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, despite thorough examination of multiple sections. A total of 42 neoplasms were observed in 24.1% of the patients. One patient had bilateral low-grade clear cell adenocarcinoma. Another patient had a transitional cell neoplasm. The remaining 39 neoplasms were microscopic adenomas. Neoplasms tended to occur more often in men and older patients.

Arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output (indocyanine green dye) were measured in triplicate; total peripheral resistance and central blood volume were calculated by standard formulas. Hemodynamics were determined at baseline and 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after intravenous (IV) bolus injection of furosemide 60 mg. Furosemide produced a decrease in central blood volume of -13% +/- 2.2% from pretreatment values (P less than .01) that was most pronounced five minutes after injection, together with a fall in cardiac output (from 6.76 +/- 0.59 to 6.17 +/- 0.52 L/min, P less than .10). Stroke volume decreased with a maximum fall occurring after 15 minutes (from 84 +/- 7 to 79 +/- 7 mL/min, P less than .05), and total peripheral resistance increased (from 15.8 +/- 2.1 to 17.8 +/- 2.3 units, P less than .05) after furosemide. Arterial pressure and heart rate did not change. The decrease in central blood volume reflects a shift of the total blood volume from the cardiopulmonary circulation to the periphery, suggesting dilation of the peripheral venous bed. Thus, even in patients undergoing hemodialysis, furosemide acutely decreases left ventricular preload by venous dilation and should therefore prove to be beneficial in acute volume overload.\r"

Of the three other patients, two started again with CAPD after peritonitis had been cured, but one patient preferred to stay on hemodialysis. In four episodes, peritoneal white cell counts remained high during treatment despite negative cultures. This was probably the result of irritation of the peritoneal membrane caused by the antifungal treatment, possibly by amphotericin B.

For these studies polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised to acid beta-glucosidase preparations containing a single N-terminal amino acid sequence that was colinear with that encoded by the beta-Glc cDNAs. Three forms (Mr approximately equal to 67,000, 64,000-61,000, and 58,000) of cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) were observed in control individuals. Decreased amounts of the same CRIM forms were detected in most type 1 Gaucher disease patients, but single CRIM forms of variable molecular weight were observed in several non-Jewish type 1 variants. One or two CRIM forms of variable molecular weight were found in neuronopathic (type 2 and type 3) patients. The amount of CRIM was severely decreased in the majority of the type 2 and type 3 patients; one American black type 2 patient was CRIM negative. With this one exception, one CRIM form was detected in the cell-free culture media from all normal or Gaucher disease fibroblasts that had an Mr approximately 2,000 greater than the highest respective intracellular molecular-weight form. All intra- or extracellular CRIM forms were reduced to a single form after deglycosylation with N-Glycanase. In addition, the radioactivity from [3H]Br-conduritol B epoxide, a specific covalent inhibitor of beta-Glc, localized to the CRIM forms of beta-Glc on immunoblots. These results indicate that all subtypes and variants of Gaucher disease result from mutations that alter the stability and/or processing of beta-Glc. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the CRIM patterns within and among the variants of Gaucher disease cause the diagnostic usefulness of immunoblotting to be restricted to those families in which the phenotype has been well established.\r"

  ".W": "Ataxia telangiectasia is a genetically determined disease with multi-system abnormalities and a high incidence of neoplasia. In order to define the nature of the association between ataxia telangiectasia and malignancy, we investigated a patient with the disease and heterozygote for the Mediterranean variant of the X-linked marker glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Enzymatic mosaicism in hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells was evaluated with the 2-deoxy glucose 6-phosphate technique. While erythrocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes expressed the same double-enzyme phenotype as tissues of nonhemopoietic origin, granulocytes and monocytes expressed almost exclusively the Mediterranean-type enzyme. We suggest that, as the result of genetic instability at the hemopoietic stem-cell level, the granulocytic/monocytic progeny enjoyed a proliferative advantage and became the predominant clone.\r"

  ".W": "A 31-year-old man with hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) deficiency was evaluated for an odd odor to his breath. He had no other symptoms. Plasma methionine was 716 microM (normal, 15-40 microM), and plasma methionine-oxidation products were 460 microM (normal, 0). Hepatic MAT activity was 28% of normal. Unlike the control human enzyme, the patient's residual MAT activity was not stimulated by 10% dimethylsulfoxide and the velocity was not increased by high substrate concentration; at 1.0 mM methionine, the patient's MAT activity was only 7% of normal. These biochemical findings are consistent with a deficiency of the high-Km isoenzyme of MAT. Despite this enzyme deficiency, liver histology and clinical tests of hepatic and other organ function were normal. The patient, who is 25 years older than the oldest reported individual with MAT deficiency, provides evidence that partial MAT deficiency is a benign disorder and that chronic hypermethioninemia (less than 1 mM) is not by itself detrimental to health.\r"

  ".W": "Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has recently been identified in a subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse. These autonomic nervous system abnormalities may correspond, in part, to biochemical alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors. Nine women with mitral valve prolapse and symptoms and signs of beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity and seven normal volunteer women were studied. Quiet standing (five minutes) increased both heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (p less than 0.05) in symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse compared with normal subjects. The dose of isoproterenol required either to increase heart rate 25 beats/minute (0.5 +/- 0.3 microgram versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 microgram) or to decrease mean arterial pressure 20 mm Hg (11.1 +/- 4.8 versus 78.2 +/- 25.2 micrograms) was significantly less in the patients with mitral valve prolapse than in the volunteers. Symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse were desensitized by a four-hour isoproterenol infusion, whereas sensitivity in normal control subjects did not change. In the patients with mitral valve prolapse, baseline beta-adrenergic receptor coupling was elevated compared with that in control subjects (220 +/- 7 versus 81 +/- 2; p less than 0.001). Isoproterenol infusion induced uncoupling in these patients (KL/KH = 35 +/- 3, p less than 0.05) but did not alter coupling in normal volunteers. This study demonstrates physiologic and pharmacologic beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity in vivo directly corresponding to biochemical supercoupling in a subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse.\r"

Measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels were elevated in three patients; levels were not determined in a fourth patient who became normocalcemic when vitamin D therapy was discontinued. Published data on the use of vitamin D for prophylaxis or treatment of any form of osteoporosis fail to document benefits superior to those of calcium alone or calcium with estrogens and fluoride. Data on the use of 25-OH D show no greater benefit than for vitamin D. The use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OH2 D) plus calcium may be superior to the use of calcium alone in some forms of osteoporosis. Vitamin D toxicity is associated with enhanced resorption of bone in some patients. Morbidity included extended hospitalization, dialysis, and chronic renal failure. Pharmacologic doses of vitamin D cannot be recommended for any form of osteoporosis.\r"

The CAGE questionnaire--a mnemonic for attempts to cut back on drinking, being annoyed at criticisms about drinking, feeling guilty about drinking, and using alcohol as an eye opener--was utilized as a screening instrument. The mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells, liver transaminase levels, and the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level were also evaluated as screening tests. The presence or absence of alcoholism and alcohol abuse for a consecutive sample of CAGE-negative patients and all patients answering \"yes\" to one or more of the CAGE questions was established through the administration of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, a detailed chart review, and analysis of quantity of alcohol consumed. Diagnostic criteria were those described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III. The prevalence of alcohol abuse was 20 percent. The mean corpuscular volume, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase value, and liver transaminase levels were very insensitive as screening tests. In contrast, the CAGE questionnaire had a sensitivity of 85 percent and a specificity of 89 percent. Only 63 percent of the alcoholic subjects and alcohol abusers were detected by their physicians, and in only 24 percent of these cases did a physician address the problem with the patient. The CAGE questionnaire is a simple, sensitive, and specific screening test for alcohol abusers.\r"

To improve the understanding of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its determinants in the aged, a defined population of 111 ambulatory, retirement-home residents underwent thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation. Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Wintrobe erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and plasma viscosity measurements were all significantly correlated with one another as well as with plasma proteins, particularly fibrinogen and globulins. Age per se had no influence on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the study population. On the basis of standard upper limits of normal for younger populations, the Wintrobe sedimentation rate was most commonly abnormal and plasma viscosity least commonly abnormal. The \"normal\" upper limit of 20 mm/hour for Westergren sedimentation rate was also the optimal limit of normal by receiver operating characteristic analysis of the study population. Although the sensitivity of the Westergren sedimentation rate for the presence of an inflammatory condition or monoclonal gammopathy was only 0.55, the specificity was 0.96, and the positive predictive value of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate being associated with a clinical disorder was 0.93. The enhanced clinical utility of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in this population compared with other elderly populations may be due to a low prevalence of anemia and hypoalbuminemia. In such populations, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may remain a useful clinical test, regardless of patient age.\r"

Initial biopsy material was classified according to the Working Formulation, and the Rappaport, Kiel, and Lukes-Collins systems. The Cox analysis identified a group of 37 patients with a median survival of 150 months. These patients had the following characteristics: small lymphocyte, plasmacytoid lymphocyte, small cleaved, large cleaved or non-cleaved follicular center cell histologic subtype (Lukes-Collins); no bulky involvement of mesenteric nodes or critical organs--kidney, urinary tract, or pleura; stages I to III disease (78 percent stage I or IE); no B symptoms; age below 60 years; initial resection as a reflection of localized disease. Patients with advanced-stage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving conservative treatment have a relatively short survival (median, less than five years) regardless of histologic subtype.\r"

A smaller peak was also noted at 6 P.M. The rise in human mortality beginning at 2 A.M. and peaking at 8 A.M. might be explained by: artifact of deaths occurring anytime during the night that are discovered after daybreak, effect of less efficient health care between 2 A.M. and 8 A.M., and disease processes that somehow increase risk of death between 2 A.M. and 8 A.M. An attempt was made to differentiate among these possibilities by comparing time of death for various subsamples. The bimodal pattern appeared only in the temporal distribution of deaths of persons over 65 years of age; deaths of persons under 65 did not show significant temporal concentration. There were also prominent differences in the distribution of deaths for different reported causes of death. Ischemic heart disease, which numerically accounted for over 50 percent of the sample, showed peak mortality at 8 A.M. for both males and females. Hypertensive disease showed a significant peak in mortality at 1 A.M. for females only. Cerebrovascular disease peaked significantly at 6 A.M. with a significant peak only for males. The age and disease specificity of the 2 A.M. to 8 A.M. rise in death is consistent with a disease-related explanation for the bimodal circadian pattern in mortality. The quality and efficiency of health care could be improved with more precise information on peak periods of risk for specific morbid conditions.\r"

Forty-three cases reported in the literature since 1974 are reviewed, along with five new cases. The average age of the patients was 55 (27 to 82), with an even distribution between men and women. Marked hypercalcemia (17.5 +/- 2.1 mg/dl) was accompanied by parathyroid hormone levels 20 times normal. Virtually all patients had symptoms. Hyperparathyroid bone disease occurred in 53 percent of patients; even more (69 percent) had nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Combined renal and skeletal involvement was seen in 50 percent. Only three deaths were recorded. The pathophysiology of the acute hyperparathyroid state is unknown but appears to consist of uncontrolled parathyroid hormone secretion followed by cycles of hypercalcemia, polyuria, dehydration, reduced renal function, and worsening hypercalcemia. These features of acute primary hyperparathyroidism are compared with the features reported in the literature antedating multichannel screening, and with the features of the common form of primary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical guidelines by which the diagnosis may be suspected are also reviewed.\r"

Contrary to expectations, 81.6 percent of patients with low B12 levels had a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) below 95 fl. Literature-derived criteria missed 30 percent of patients with low B12 levels. Only three of 12 patients with megaloblastic bone marrow or an abnormal Schilling result had B12 levels that were low (below 100 pg/ml), and nine had values in an intermediate range (100 to 200 pg/ml). This suggests that the use of an MCV below 95 fl and a B12 level below 100 pg/ml as abnormal values may not detect clinically important B12 deficiency.\r"

Histomorphometry of a bone biopsy specimen showed evidence of increased osteoclastic bone resorption. By 16 hours after tumor removal, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level had normalized, but serum phosphorus level was unchanged; at 28 hours, both serum phosphorus value and tubular reabsorption of phosphate were within normal limits. It is concluded that tumor removal is associated with rapid correction both of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production and of renal phosphate wasting. Increased bone resorption suggests the production of an osteoclast activator by the tumor and may explain the typically normal serum calcium value in this disorder.\r"

A case of biopsy-proved pretibial myxedema was encountered in a clinically euthyroid woman who had neither diffuse goiter nor exophthalmos. Although serum total and free thyroxine hormone concentrations were normal, the thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone was absent. This case illustrates that pretibial myxedema may present without other more common manifestations of Graves' disease. In patients with suspect pretibial skin lesions, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test may be required to establish the presence of subtle underlying thyroid gland autonomy and the diagnosis of euthyroid pretibial myxedema.\r"

This report describes a male subject with a prolactinoma whose preoperative evaluation demonstrated a resistance of prolactin release to inhibition by dopamine. Evaluation of prolactin secretion from monolayer culture of his tumor also revealed a resistance to inhibition by dopamine. Four months postoperatively, normal serum prolactin levels and a normal maximal inhibition of prolactin to a dopamine infusion of 0.04 microgram/kg/minute suggested surgical cure. However, a 24-hour prolactin sampling revealed blunted nocturnal augmentation of prolactin release, an early escape of inhibition of prolactin release at 150 minutes from a 0.04 microgram/kg/minute dopamine infusion, and abnormal prolactin response to a low-dose (0.004 microgram/kg/minute) dopamine infusion. Hence, persistent abnormalities in prolactin secretory dynamics were noted with more extensive testing in this patient when he was thought to have been cured. One year postoperatively, the hyperprolactinemia recurred, prolactin release was markedly resistant to dopamine, and an abnormal 24-hour prolactin profile of release was present. Thus, resistance of prolactin secretion to inhibition by dopamine was present in this patient with a prolactinoma. Additionally, an abnormal prolactin response to dopamine was noted to precede the development of hyperprolactinemia with tumor recurrence.\r"

To evaluate the prevalence of this disorder, all patients with thyroid nodules referred in a 12-month period underwent fine-needle aspiration, regardless of history or scan results. Seventy patients were studied, six of whom had a previous history of malignant disease. Two of the latter had coincidental thyroid disease, but four (5.7% of the total series) had carcinoma metastatic to the thyroid gland. Two of these patients had had no evidence of malignancy for years prior to the appearance of the thyroid metastases. In one case, the metastasis was a functioning nodule. Fine-needle aspiration cytology provided prompt and accurate diagnosis in all patients. We conclude that metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid is not rare, its presentation may be confused with primary thyroid disease, and fine-needle aspiration cytology is the procedure of choice in such cases, and should be done early in the evaluation of all patients with thyroid nodules, regardless of the presumed etiology or function by scan.\r"

The primary effect on the heart produced by a surfeit of ACh is bradyarrhythmias with consequent fall in cardiac output and hypotension; yet, adverse cardiac reactions to these agents have been reported relatively infrequently. The authors describe 12 patients with MG from a pool of more than 1,000 who suffered hypotensive episodes related to use of anti-ChEs. The 12 patients (seven male, five female) had a mean age of 62.6 years; of these, eight adverse reactions occurred after edrophonium, two after neostigmine, and two after pyridostigmine. Seven patients had a recent increase in anti-ChEs and none had a decrease in dosage. Nine patients suffered either from severe sinus bradycardia, (20 beats/min), junctional bradycardia, or complete AV dissociation. Two patients had paradoxic sinus tachycardia and all had syncopal or near-syncopal episodes. Evidence for cholinergic stimulation of other organs was generally lacking. No recurrence appeared with reduction of the dose of anti-ChEs or discontinuation of the drug. The authors believe that these agents should be given with caution to patients with inflammatory, infiltrative, or degenerative disease of the conduction systems, patients being treated with digitalis, calcium-channel antagonists or beta blockers, patients with myocardial ischemia, and elderly patients. Appropriate resuscitative equipment should be readily available.\r"

Categorizing patients by their extent of diabetes control, good family function was found in 92% of patients in good control of their diabetes mellitus, in 66% of those in fair control, and only in 50% of those in poor control (p less than 0.005, chi 2 = 44.1, df = 2).
