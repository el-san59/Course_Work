  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the mechanical arrangement of costal (COS) and crural (CRU) diaphragms can be changed from parallel to series when direct or indirect transmission of tension occurs. Ratio of rib cage to abdominal displacement (RC/AB) resulting from separate COS and CRU stimulations were used to measure RC expanding action. Hyperinflation in six dogs caused RC/AB with COS and CRU stimulations to change progressively from 0.53 +/- 0.07 (SE) and 0.03 +/- 0.05 at functional residual capacity (FRC) to -0.48 +/- 0.08 and -0.46 +/- 0.05 at 68% inspiratory capacity, respectively. Liquid substitution of abdominal contents in six other dogs equalized abdominal pressure swings (delta Pab), without changing chest wall elastic properties or geometry, or costal RC/AB (0.35 +/- 0.07 before and 0.33 +/- 0.06 after) but caused crural RC/AB to change from 0.01 +/- 0.05 to 0.31 +/- 0.01. We conclude that hyperinflation changes fiber orientation, allowing direct transmission of tension between COS and CRU, which become linked mechanically in series (the diaphragm acts as a unit with RC deflating action); and equalization of delta Pab causes indirect transmission of tension between COS and CRU, which become linked in series (the diaphragm acts as a unit with RC inflating action).\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory sensations evoked by added inspiratory loads are currently thought to be largely mediated by the activity of the inspiratory muscles. Because of the differences in proprioceptors and in afferent and efferent innervations among the inspiratory muscles, we hypothesized that the sensation evoked by a given load would be different when the motor command is directed mainly to rib cage muscles or mainly to the diaphragm. To test this hypothesis, we studied six normal subjects breathing against several inspiratory resistances while emphasizing the use of rib cage muscles, or the diaphragm, or a combination of both. At the end of 10 loaded breaths the subjects rated the perceived magnitude of inspiratory effort on a Borg scale. A linear and unique relationship (r = 0.96 +/- 0.02; P less than 0.001) was found between the sensation and esophageal pressure (Pes) in the three thoracoabdominal breathing patterns. We conclude that the level of Pes, whether generated mainly by the rib cage muscles or the diaphragm, is the main variable related to the sensation of inspiratory effort under external inspiratory loads.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the relationship between diaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) waveform and electromyographic (EMG) signs of diaphragmatic fatigue (DF), 11 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects underwent a 12-stage graded treadmill exercise test (GXT). No COPD subjects completed the GXT; all stopped exercising due to dyspnea. We then used the crural diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi) to divide the COPD subjects into a group that exhibited EMGdi signs of fatigue during the GXT (i.e., F group) and one that did not (i.e., NF group); three COPD subjects were classified as F, and eight COPD subjects were classified as NF. At end exercise, F and NF groups did not differ with respect to peak inspiratory Pdi swing (peak Pdi); however, they did differ with respect to percent of peak Pdi manifest at 50 and 90% of inspiratory time (TI). At 50% TI, NF = 88 +/- 3%, F = 60 +/- 1%, P less than 0.01; likewise at 90% TI, NF = 58 +/- 5%, F = 12 +/- 10%, P less than 0.01. Since peak Pdi occurred in both groups during the initial 50% of TI, these data indicate that the F group maintained Pdi less well than the NF group during the latter half of TI. Based on the above results and other data in the manuscript, we suggest that this change in Pdi waveform can predict EMG signs of DF.\r"

Anesthetized dogs had a bronchial divider placed so that the left lower lobe (LLL) could be ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture (HGM) while the right lung was continuously ventilated with 100% O2. Bilateral permeability edema was induced with 0.05 ml/kg oleic acid and after 4 h of LLL ventilation with an HGM (n = 9) LLL gross weight was 161 +/- 13 (SE) g compared with 204 +/- 13 (SE) g (P less than 0.05) in the right lower lobe (RLL). Bloodless lobar water and dry weight were also significantly lower in the LLL as compared with the RLL of the study animals. In seven control animals in which the LLL fractional inspired concentration of O2 (FIO2) was 1.0 during permeability edema, there were no differences in gravimetric variables between LLL and RLL. In eight additional animals, pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc), measured by simultaneous occlusion of left pulmonary artery and vein, was not significantly different between LLL FIO2 of 1.0 and 0.05 either before or after pulmonary edema. We conclude that, in the presence of permeability pulmonary edema, regional alveolar hypoxia causes reduction in edema formation. The decreased edema formation during alveolar hypoxia is not due to a reduction in Pc.\r"

To test the hypothesis that heavy sustained exercise would elicit pulmonary dysfunction on exposure to 0.60 ppm NO2 and/or enhance the effects of exposure to 0.30 ppm O3, 40 aerobically trained young adults (20 males and 20 females) completed 1 h of continuous exercise at work rates eliciting a mean minute ventilation of 70 and 50 l/min for the males and females, respectively. Exposures to filtered air, 0.60 ppm NO2, 0.30 ppm O3, and 0.60 ppm NO2 plus 0.30 ppm O3 were randomly delivered via an obligatory mouthpiece inhalation system. Treatment effects were assessed by standard pulmonary function tests and exercise ventilatory and subjective symptoms response. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and post hoc analyses revealed a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) effect of O3 on forced expiratory parameters, specific airway resistance, exercise ventilatory response, and reported subjective symptoms of respiratory discomfort. In contrast, no significant effect of NO2 was observed nor was there any significant interaction of NO2 and O3 in combination. There were no significant differences between male and female responses to gas mixture treatments. It was concluded that inhalation of 0.60 ppm NO2 for 1 h while engaged in heavy sustained exercise does not elicit effects evidenced by measurement techniques used in this study nor evoke additive effects beyond those induced by 0.30 ppm O3 in healthy young adults.\r"

Samples of eight diaphragm regions, internal intercostals, external intercostals, transversus abdominis, and triceps brachii were removed from eight adult mongrel dogs, frozen, and histochemically processed for standard fiber type and fiber diameter determinations. The respiratory muscles were composed of types I and IIa fibers; no IIb fibers were identified. Fiber composition differed between muscles (P less than 0.0001). Normal type I percent (+/- SE) were: diaphragm 46 +/- 2, external intercostal 85 +/- 6, internal intercostals 48 +/- 3, transversus abdominis 53 +/- 1, and triceps 33 +/- 7. The diaphragm also contained a type I subtype [6 +/- 1% (SE)] previously thought only to occur in developing muscle. Fiber composition varied between diaphragm regions (P less than 0.01). Most notably, left medial crus contained 64% type I fibers. Fiber size also varied systematically among muscles (P less than 0.025) and diaphragm regions (P less than 0.0005). External intercostal fiber diameter was largest (47-50 microns) and diaphragm was smallest (34 microns). Within diaphragm, crural fibers were larger than costal (P less than 0.05). We conclude that there are systematic differences in fiber composition and fiber diameter of the canine respiratory muscles.\r"

PSN efferents which responded to hypoxia were selected for the study. The PSN activity, breath-by-breath inspiratory tidal volume, tracheal PO2 and PCO2, and arterial systemic blood pressure were recorded simultaneously. The responses of PSN efferents to transient changes in and steady-state levels of arterial PO2 and PCO2 and to graded bolus injections of intravenous sodium cyanide (50-100 micrograms), nicotine (50-100 micrograms), and dopamine hydrochloride (30-60 micrograms) were compared before and after bilateral section of carotid sinus nerves (CSN). CSN section raised the base-line PSN activity and practically eliminated the responses to brief pharmacological stimuli, but it did not eliminate the responses to transient changes in and steady-state levels of arterial PO2 and PCO2. However, CSN section diminished PSN responses and abolished ventilatory responses to hypoxia. Thus the PSN response to hypoxia was partly independent of peripheral chemoreflex and of respiratory drive. We conclude that carotid body chemoreflex elicits fast PSN responses and that a moderate decline in arterial PO2 causes an additional slow, direct excitation of sympathetic nervous system. The latter indicates O2 chemosensitivity of the system in the physiological range of arterial PO2. This O2-sensing property may allow sympathetic nervous system to initiate chemoreflex responses independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors.\r"

Immediately after exercise, 12 of 13 dogs were less sensitive to the chronotropic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation: mean CD25 increased from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 3.50 +/- 0.98 micrograms (P less than 0.02). A similar reduction in isoproterenol sensitivity was evident regardless of whether testing was performed in the presence or absence of vagal blockade with atropine. By 3 h after exercise, CD25 had returned to the preexercise level, with no further change noted 24 h after exercise. There was no change in the CD25 when measured serially in three unexercised dogs. We conclude that a single bout of dynamic exercise is sufficient to produce a significantly decreased chronotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol. This phenomenon may represent an acute but transient desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

Blood flow to the heart, diaphragm, brain, skin, and 9 of 10 muscles investigated was similar during maximal exercise pre- and posttraining; however, blood flow to the gastrocnemius muscle was greater posttraining than it was pretraining. Blood flow to the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas decreased during maximal exercise pre- and posttraining; however, blood flow to the large intestine, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, and kidneys decreased during maximal exercise only posttraining. In addition, a larger decrease in blood flow to the stomach during maximal exercise was found posttraining compared with pretraining. These results demonstrate that blood flow to skeletal muscle, the kidneys, and the splanchnic region of the foxhound during maximal exercise can be significantly altered by dynamic exercise training.\r"

The tracheal pressure signal was digitized (at 51 samples/s), differentiated, and the start and peak of each breath was recognized from the zero-crossing points of the differentiated signal. Each breath was validated for size and shape according to a set of criteria incorporated into the breath recognition algorithm. On acceptance of the pressure change as a valid breath, the inspiratory time, breath amplitude, breath-to-breath interval, and inspiratory effort were calculated and stored in memory. The program was structured so that the microprocessor was able to accept new data and output summarizes of previous data concurrently. More than 95% of breaths in records contaminated with movement artifacts were recognized.\r"

  ".W": "Although measurement errors in the multiple inert gas elimination technique have a coefficient of variation of approximately 3%, small biological fluctuations in ventilation, blood flow, or other variables must contribute additional variance to this method of assessing ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch. To determine overall variance of computed indices of VA/Q mismatch, an analysis of variance was carried out using a total of 400 duplicate pairs of inert gas samples obtained from canine (N = 118) and human (N = 282) studies in the past 2 years. In both sets VA/Q mismatch ranged from minimal (2nd moment of ventilation and blood flow distributions, log SDV and log SDQ, respectively approximately equal to 0.3 each) to severe (log SDV and log SDQ approximately equal to 2.0). Differences between duplicate log SD values were computed and found to be a constant fraction of the mean log SD of each duplicate pair, averaging 13% for both canine and human ventilation and blood flow data. The resultant coefficient of variation for a single measurement of log SD about its mean averaged 8.6% for all data combined. This analysis demonstrates excellent reproducibility of these dispersion indices over a wide range of conditions, and if the mean of duplicate values is used, thus reducing variability by square root 2 to 6.1%, log SD can be estimated with an approximately 95% confidence limit of +/- 12%.\r"

Appl. Physiol. 59: 597-602, 1985). We built a model to discover why the vertical gradient in pleural pressure is less than hydrostatic (1 cmH2O/cm). A long rubber balloon of cylindrical shape was inflated in a plastic cylinder. The \"pleural\" space between the balloon and cylinder was filled with blue-dyed water. With the cylinder vertical, we measured pleural pressure by a transducer through side taps at 2-cm intervals up the cylinder. The pressure was measured with different amounts of water in the pleural space. With a clear separation between the balloon and the container, the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure was hydrostatic. As water was withdrawn from the pleural space, the balloon approached the wall of the container. Over an 8-cm-long midregion of the model where the balloon diameter matched the cylinder diameter, the vertical gradient was not hydrostatic and was virtually absent. In this region, the pleural liquid pressure was uniform and equal to the recoil of the balloon. In this section we could not see any pleural space. By scintillation imaging using 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid in the water, we estimated the thickness of this flat \"costal\" pleural space to be approximately 20 microns. Radioactive tracer injected at the top of the pleural space appeared by 24 h at the bottom, which indicated a slow drainage of liquid by gravity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscle strips were dissected free of epithelial and connective tissue and suspended for isometric tension recording in modified Krebs-Ringer solution. Dissociation constants for all three agonists were determined by analysis of their concentration-response curves under control conditions and after partial inactivation of receptors by phenoxybenzamine dihydrochloride. The values of KA for acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and histamine were 1.8 X 10(-5) M, 1.35 X 10(-6) M, and 5.0 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Dissociation constants were used to determine receptor occupancy-response relationships. Maximal responses to acetylcholine were obtained by activation of only 4.0 +/- 1.0% of receptors, indicating the presence of a very large receptor-reserve. In contrast, a maximal response to 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine required activation of 78.0 +/- 11.0 and 87.7 +/- 1.6% of the receptors, respectively, indicating very modest receptor reserves. The differences in receptor-reserve characteristics for these agonists in airway muscle might contribute to the differential effects of inhibitory and facilitory influences on contractions elicited by them.\r"

In an additional study in a laboratory at sea level, three male and four female subjects inspired various O2-N2 mixtures [fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) = 20.93, 17.39, 14.40, 11.81%] that were administered in a single-blind randomized fashion during a treadmill run (40% FIO2 maximum O2 consumption). Breathing and gait signals were stored on FM tape and later processed on a PDP 11/73 computer. The subharmonic relationships between these signals were determined from Fourier analysis (power spectrum), and the coincidence of coupling occurrence was statistically modeled. Entrainment decreased linearly during increasing hypoxia (P less than 0.01). Moreover, a significant linear increase in f occurred during hypoxia (P less than 0.05), whereas stride frequency and metabolic rate remained constant, suggesting that hypoxic-induced increases in f decreased the degree of entrainment.\r"

Platelet counts significantly decreased after the decompression. Kinetic studies with 111In-oxine-labeled platelets revealed shortened survivals of circulating platelets, and audioradiograms indicated the accumulation of radioactivity in the lungs after the decompression. Although there was no change in the mode volume of platelets after the decompression, the transient appearance of circulating smaller or fragmented platelets suggested a random overdestruction of platelets. Whole and releasable adenine nucleotide contents of platelets were decreased significantly after the decompression. There were no significant changes in cytoplasmic adenine nucleotide contents. Therefore, in decompression sickness, the circulating platelets behaved similarly to those in acquired storage pool disease. Platelet thrombi were found in the pulmonary arteries, compatible with the accumulation of 111In-oxine-labeled platelets. These findings suggest that circulating air bubbles interact with platelets, causing the platelet release reaction, and these activated platelets participate in the formation of thrombi in experimental decompression sickness.\r"

Since the internal intercostal nerves were detached from the thorax to reinnervate the musculus biceps brachii, it was possible to record pure intercostal motor activity in humans. Respiratory activity was seen in the latter part of the expiratory phase, thus dividing the phase into two substages (E1 and E2) by the onset of the activity. CO2 rebreathing prolonged the duration of the intercostal motor activity and increased the tidal activity as determined from the integration curve. There was a close linear correlation between these two variables. These observations indicate that expiratory activity and its duration are actively controlled in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Eight untrained women (F), 13 untrained men (M), and 11 male bodybuilders (BB) did maximal elbow flexions on an isokinetic dynamometer at velocities of 30, 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees/s, from which impact torque (IT), peak torque (PT), and work (W) were measured. Biceps and total flexor cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured by computerized tomographic scanning. Muscle fiber area, fiber composition, and collagen volume density were determined from single needle biopsies of biceps brachii. Biceps fiber number was estimated as the ratio of biceps CSA (corrected for connective tissue) to mean fiber area. PT and W decreased at higher velocities in M and BB but not in F; consequently, the correlation between CSA and PT and W was lower at 300 degrees/s (r = 0.58, 0.60) than 30 degrees/s (r = 0.80, 0.79). The ratio of PT to flexor CSA was similar in all groups at 30 degrees/s, whereas F had greater ratios than M and BB at the remaining velocities. F had greater W/CSA ratios than M and BB at all velocities. IT increased at higher velocities in all groups; the increase was greater in F and M than in BB. In contrast to PT and W, the correlation between IT and CSA was greater at 300 degrees/s (r = 0.67) than 30 degrees/s (r = 0.58), and there were no differences among groups in the IT/CSA ratios. Flexor CSA correlated negatively with the ratio of IT, PT, and W to CSA. Muscle fiber composition failed to correlate with any measure of strength. M and BB had greater biceps area, fiber number, and fiber area than F.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "When the delivery of O2 to tissues (QO2 = blood flow X O2 content) falls below a critical threshold, tissue O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by QO2. The mechanism responsible for this extraction limitation is not understood but may involve molecular diffusion limitation as mean capillary PO2 drops below a critical minimum level in some capillaries. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the critical QO2 necessary to maintain VO2 independent of QO2 in anesthetized, paralyzed normal dogs (n = 7) and in a second group in which PO2 at 50% saturation of hemoglobin (P50) was reduced by exchange transfusion with low-P50 erythrocytes (n = 7). QO2 was reduced in stages by removing blood volume to reduce blood flow while VO2 was measured by spirometry at each step. To the extent that O2 extraction was limited by a critical capillary PO2, we reasoned that the onset of diffusion limitation should occur at a higher QO2 with low P50, since a lower end-capillary PO2 is required to achieve the same O2 extraction. The critical QO2 (7.8 +/- 1.2 ml X min-1 X kg-1) and extraction ratio (0.63 +/- 0.06) in dogs with reduced P50 were not different from controls. At the critical delivery, mixed venous PO2 was lower in low P50 (16.1 +/- 2.9 Torr) than controls (29.9 +/- 2.3 Torr). We concluded that diffusion limitation does not initiate the early fall in VO2 below the critical QO2 and offer an alternative model to explain the onset of supply dependency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both drugs failed to alter rPBF. In addition, the pressor response to whole-lung hypoxia was not blocked by an FPL-55712 infusion.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 10 degrees C and exposed to 600-MHz radiation while metabolic rate (MR) was measured by indirect calorimetry. RF radiation exposures were made in a waveguide-type system that permitted the continuous control of specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR's of 2-5 W/kg led to significant reductions in MR when averaged from 30 to 60 min after the initiation of RF radiation exposure. The total decrease in MR during RF radiation exposure accounted for approximately 37% of the total RF heat load. Exposure of another group of rats to the same SAR's at a Ta of 10 degrees C resulted in a significant elevation in colonic temperature. Thus, despite the decrease in MR, heat gain still exceeded heat loss during RF radiation exposure, with a resultant elevation in deep body temperature. In conclusion, in a cold environment the rat exposed to RF radiation decreases its MR. However, the response time and efficiency of the response is not adequate to prevent an increase in body temperature.\r"

Lobar resistance (RL) was partitioned at six different lung volumes into three components: central airway resistance (Rc), small airway resistance (Rp), and tissue resistance (Rt). Pressure in small airways (2-3 mm ID) was measured with a retrograde catheter. Alveolar pressure was sampled in capsules glued onto the punctured pleural surface. RL was minimal at values of Ptp comprised between 0.5 and 0.7 kPa and increased at higher and lower values of Ptp. At a Ptp of 0.5 kPa, Rc, Rp, and Rt represented 30, 15, and 55% of RL, respectively, in Friesian calves and 25, 25, and 50% in BWB calves. Rp increased markedly at low lung volumes. Rt was responsible for the increase of RL at high Ptp. Rc tended to decrease at high Ptp. The significantly higher values of Rp in BWB calves (P less than 0.05) might explain the sensitivity of this breed to severe bronchopneumonia.\r"

The aim of this study was to compare the arousal thresholds in SWS and REM sleep in response to an upper airway pressure stimulus. We compared the waking responses to tracheal (T) vs. nasal (N) occlusion in four unanesthetized, naturally sleeping dogs. The dogs either breathed through a tracheal fistula or through the snout using a fiberglass mask. A total of 295 T and 160 N occlusion tests were performed in SWS and REM sleep. The mean time to arousal during N and T tests was variable in the same dog and among the dogs. The mean time to arousal in SWS-tracheal occlusion was longer than that in N tests in only two of the four dogs. The total number of tests inducing arousal within the first 15 s of SWS-nasal occlusion tests was significantly more than that of T tests (N: 47%; T: 27%). There was a marked depression of arousal within the initial 15 s of REM sleep in T tests compared with N tests (N: 21%; T: 0%). The frequency of early arousals in REM tests was less than that of SWS for both N and T tests. The early arousal in N occlusion is in sharp contrast to the well-described depressed arousal responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and asphyxia. This pattern of arousal suggests that the upper airway mechanoreceptors may play an important role in the induction of an early arousal from nasal occlusion.\r"

The response variables that were measured were muscle blood flow, shortening during constant load contractions, and arterial and venous O2 and lactate concentrations. The calculated variables were O2 uptake (VO2), net lactic acid output (L), and power output. In the control experiments, the contractions increased VO2 to approximately 50 times rest by 2 min. Thereafter, shortening, work, and VO2 declined together by 17% at 30 min, indicating muscle fatigue. L increased rapidly to nearly 0.8 mumol X g-1 X min-1 by 2 min, declined to 0.3-0.4 mumol X g-1 X min-1 by 7 min, and was like rest at 15, 22.5, and 30 min. The arterial lactate concentration rose steadily from rest to 30 min of contractions. Epinephrine infusion stopped the decline of VO2 during the contractions, but this effect was not observed with the other agonists. Propranolol decreased VO2 compared with controls at 22.5 and 30 min of contractions. Phenoxybenzamine decreased VO2 compared with controls at all times during contraction, and the decline with time was present. Coinfusion of epinephrine with propranolol reduced the decline in VO2 observed with propranolol alone. Both epinephrine and isoproterenol increased L compared with controls. This epinephrine response was antagonized by propranolol but enhanced by phenoxybenzamine. Both isoproterenol and epinephrine infusions increased arterial lactate concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Indicator mixtures of 125I-albumin, 51Cr-red blood cells, 3HOH, and U or Pr were injected under base-line conditions, after 1.2 g of alloxan, and after an additional 0.8 g of alloxan. Indicator-dilution curves were analyzed from sampled outflow blood to provide PS, the square root of effective extravascular diffusivity multiplied by exchange surface area (D1/2S), and extravascular lung water (EVLW) from the tracer mean transit times (VW). Results show that alloxan increases PS and D1/2S for U, D1/2S for Pr, and VW and EVLW by desiccation. All indicator-dilution parameters correlate significantly with alloxan dose. Interpretation of Pr transport suggests that materials with lipid and hydrophilic pathways might be used in conjunction with U to minimize the effects of surface area changes and increase the sensitivity of these tracers to permeability alteration. In addition Pr may be a useful alternative to U as a marker of vascular damage.\r"

To determine whether volume-related inspiratory inhibition occurs beyond the neonatal period, we performed 10 +/- 1 end-expiratory occlusions in nine asleep children, ages 2-29 mo, with cuffed tracheostomy or endotracheal tubes in place. Airflow, tidal volume, occlusion pressure, and surface diaphragm electromyogram (DIA EMG) were simultaneously recorded. Occlusion consistently increased mechanical (P less than 0.002) and neural inspiratory times (P less than 0.001). During occluded respiratory efforts, peak amplitude of DIA EMG increased by 22 +/- 10% (P less than 0.002). In contrast, initial rate of rise of DIA EMG did not change. We conclude that in children with isolated lower airways, end-expiratory occlusions prolonged inspiratory duration as measured by both mechanical and neural parameters. The lack of an associated increase in rate of rise of DIA EMG strongly suggests that inspiration is prolonged by release of volume-related inhibition of inspiration rather than by facilitation. These data provide evidence for the presence of the Hering-Breuer reflex beyond the neonatal period.\r"

This range in species provided a wide variation in subgross anatomy as well as a fourfold range in alveolar diameter. Alveolar diameter was estimated from the mean linear intercept (Lm) of fixed lungs. Quasi-static pressure-volume curves were determined in excised lungs and the percent volume remaining on deflation from total lung capacity at 30 cmH2O to 10 cmH2O (%V10) provided an index of deflation stability related to functional surfactant. Surface tension of lung extract was measured in the Wilhelmy balance, and the minimum surface tension measured provided an index of surface tension lowering capacity of surfactant. Relationships of %V10 with alveolar diameter and surface tension with alveolar diameter were examined for correlations. Our results indicated that despite a range in Lm between 31 and 133 micron (mouse to pig), %V10 did not change in proportion with Lm across species. Similarly, minimum surface tension was about the same (6.1 to 8.8 dyn/cm) across a threefold difference in alveolar diameter. These results suggest that a stable alveolar configuration is maintained by both surface and tissue forces in a complex manner yet to be analyzed.\r"

The orientation of planes that best fit the data for each rib at each lung volume and the circular arcs that fit the points in the planes of the ribs were determined, and average values of these geometrical parameters for ribs 3-7 are reported. The planes of the ribs at TLC can be described as displaced from the planes at FRC by a rotation about an axis that passes near the spine. The pump handle and bucket handle components of rotation are 11 and 13 degrees, respectively, for rib 3 and both decrease with increasing rib number to 7 and 10 degrees at rib 7. The angles between the axes of rotation and the midplane are approximately 35 degrees for all 5 ribs. The radii of the circular arcs fit to the data at TLC are slightly larger than those at FRC, and this suggests that there is a small component of rotation normal to the plane of the rib.\r"

Before fixation alveolar surface tensions (gamma) were measured in individual alveoli over the entire P-V loop, using an improved microdroplet method. A maximal gamma of approximately 30 mN/m was measured at TLC, which decreased during lung deflation to about 1 mN/m at 40% TLC. Surface tensions were considerably higher on the inflation limb starting from zero pressure than on the deflation limb (gamma-V hysteresis). In contrast, the corresponding alveolar surface area-volume (SA-V) relationship did not form a complete hysteresis over the entire volume range. There was a considerable difference in SA between lungs inflated to 40% TLC (1.49 +/- 0.11 m2) and lungs deflated to 40% TLC (2.19 +/- 0.21 m2), but at 80% TLC the values of SA were essentially the same regardless of the volume history. The data indicate that the gamma-SA hysteresis is only in part accountable for the P-V hysteresis and that the determinative factors of alveolar geometry change with lung volume. At low lung volumes airspace dimensions appear to be governed by an interplay between surface and tissue forces. At higher lung volumes the tissue forces become predominant.\r"

Peak twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure declined from 49.1 +/- 9.1 (SD) cmH2O at RV to 19.6 +/- 5.97 (SD) cmH2O at TLC. Twitch contraction time fell from 91.8 +/- 11.3 (SD) ms at RV to 57.7 +/- 7.4 (SD) ms at TLC. There was a good correlation between changes in contraction time and transdiaphragmatic pressure (r = 0.7). The fall in transdiaphragmatic pressure was almost all due to a fall in pleural pressure, with little change in gastric pressure between RV and TLC. At TLC the pleural pressure in response to phrenic nerve stimulation was -0.58 cmH2O. We conclude that, as lung volume increases and the diaphragm shortens, it becomes less effective as a pressure generator and that pressure it generates is less well converted into useful inspiratory pressure. At a lung volume close to TLC, the diaphragm ceases to act as an inspiratory muscle.\r"

Four inspiratory resistive loads (8.9-35.7 cmH2O X l-1 X s) were presented twice each in random order. Subjects were asked to estimate load magnitude by force of handgrip. Perceptual performance was quantified using Stevens power law, psi = k phi n, where psi is the subject's estimate, k is a constant, and phi is the peak mouth pressure developed against the load. The exponent n represents the slope of the line in the plot of log psi vs. log phi. After a 2-min period in which subjects were required to generate 80% of their maximum inspiratory pressure against a high resistance, the load estimation protocol was repeated. Estimates were significantly reduced compared to control; however, there was no significant difference in the exponent for magnitude functions between conditions. Similar results were obtained in a second parallel experiment involving magnitude estimation of weights lifted by the elbow flexors. The results suggest plasticity in the mechanism(s) subserving sensation of added loads to breathing and that such plasticity is a general feature of sensation arising from nonrespiratory muscles as well.\r"

In 10 open-chested dogs the left lower lobe (LLL) was isolated and perfused in situ with autologous blood at a controlled temperature with an independent vascular circuit. The abdomen and the chest of the dog were enclosed in a Plexiglas box in which air was fully humidified and temperature could be regulated. Qbr, determined by the reference flow technique using 16 micron microspheres, was measured before and 30 min after onset of PAO with the air in the box being either at 27 or 39 degrees C and with warmed LLL blood (37 degrees C) in the latter condition. Anastomotic bronchial blood flow [Qbr(s-p), determined as overflow from the closed LLL vascular circuit and measured in ml X min-1 X 100 g dry lung wt-1 X 100 Torr mean systemic pressure-1] was measured continuously at both temperatures. Both before and after PAO, Qbr and Qbr(s-p) were closely correlated: Qbr (ml/min) = 1.12 + 0.978Qbr(s-p); R = 0.912. This was true regardless of the presence or the absence of pulmonary flow, showing that the distribution of bronchial blood flow between the anastomotic and the nonanastomotic portion does not change acutely during PAO. When the air in the box was 27 degrees C, Qbr(s-p) was 19.5 +/- 5.2 (SE) and increased to 38.6 +/- 8.1 with PAO (P less than 0.007).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To demonstrate that this is due to reinnervation of pulmonary stretch receptors, we recorded nerve activity from regenerated branches of the left vagus nerve in five beagle dogs. Ten days postdenervation the BHR was absent, whereas by 19 mo it was clearly present. Multifiber pulmonary afferent activity was observed in all five dogs with single-fiber activity observed in three. Sectioning the right vagus nerve did not alter the BHR, but sectioning all the regenerated branches of the left vagus abolished the reflex. In two additional dogs studied 17 mo postsurgery, recordings were made from few fiber nerve bundles of the left cervical vagus. Nerve activity was increased during gentle stroking of the surface of the left upper and lower lobes, indicating receptive fields in both lobes. These data demonstrate that reinnervation of pulmonary stretch receptors does occur and provides evidence that reinnervation of these receptors is responsible for return of the BHR after pulmonary denervation.\r"

Twitch tension and Po were lower in S-Sol and S-P, but force/cross-sectional area was unchanged. Fiber areas were smaller, but no structural changes characteristic of disuse atrophy were found. Fiber type populations were unchanged in P, and contractile properties were only minimally affected, demonstrating the greater importance of activity for ST muscles during development.\r"

We studied the vascular effect of protamine in isolated rat lungs perfused with a cell- and plasma-free solution. Protamine (50-1,000 micrograms/ml) increased lung perfusion pressure and caused edema. Blocking the pulmonary vasoconstriction with papaverine (10(-4) M) did not prevent lung edema. In addition, lungs treated with protamine and papaverine showed increased extravascular leakage of 125I-albumin, indicating increased vascular permeability. Histological examination of these lungs showed marked endothelial injury. Functional endothelial damage was further demonstrated by the impairment of the acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation in protamine-treated vascular rings. Antihistamines and indomethacin failed to block the pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability caused by protamine. In addition, we found that anionic substances, heparin and albumin, blocked the lung injury induced by protamine, whereas other polycations, polylysine and hexadimethrine bromide, caused pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability similar to protamine. We conclude that protamine causes pulmonary endothelial injury and lung edema and suggest that the injury may be charge mediated.\r"

Three consecutive days of supramaximal exercise resulted in a preexercise reduction of hemoglobin concentration from 15.8 to 14.0 g/dl (P less than 0.05). During exercise (120% VO2peak) performed intermittently (1 min work to 4 min rest); a small but significant (P less than 0.05) increase was found for both O2 consumption (VO2) (l X min) and heart rate (beats/min) on day 2 of the training. On day 3, VO2 (l/min) was reduced 3.2% (P less than 0.05) over day 1 values. No changes were found in CO2 output and minute ventilation during exercise between training days. Similarly, short-term training failed to significantly alter the changes in arterialized blood PCO2, pH, and [HCO-3] observed during exercise. It is concluded that hypervolemia-induced reductions in O2-carrying capacity in the order of 10-11% cause minimal impairment to gas exchange and acid-base balance during supramaximal non-steady-state exercise.\r"

The results indicated that blood glucose concentration was significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) on both days 2 and 3 of the training, whereas plasma free fatty acids and blood glycerol, pyruvate, alanine, and lactate were unaffected. At the muscle level, glucose and lactate concentrations were depressed on days 2 and 3, whereas ATP and glycogen were reduced only on the final day of training. No training-induced alterations were noted for muscle glucose 6-phosphate or muscle ADP. These results indicate that the approximate 10-11% reduction in O2-carrying capacity accompanying the short-term training does not directly and negatively influence muscle energy metabolism during the exercise. Rather, the explanation for the altered muscle and blood constituents must be sought from other effects of the training such as impaired carbohydrate repletion.\r"

At therapeutic concentrations of theophylline the effective dose for 50% inhibition of twitch (ED50) for dTC (mean +/- SE, 0.115 +/- 0.016 mg/kg) was significantly shifted to the left in comparison with the control (0.165 +/-0.008 mg/kg). The ED50 of dTC for the subtherapeutic group was 0.143 +/- 0.011 mg/kg, which was less than the control but not of statistical significance (P = 0.1). The ED50 for the toxic theophylline group was 0.168 +/- 0.003 mg/kg, which was not significantly different from controls but significantly different from the theophylline therapeutic and subtherapeutic groups. Thus, toxic concentrations of theophylline reversed the potentiating effects of therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of dTC dose-response curves. Therefore, depending on concentration, theophylline exhibits a biphasic interaction with dTC. Surgical patients on theophylline may require less dTC intraoperatively. More importantly, the use of theophylline in the postoperative period to reverse anesthetic effects may result in recurarization.\r"

Exercise was on a cycle ergometer with work rate incremented from loadless pedaling to exhaustion as a 50-W/min ramp function. Two different mathematical models were studied. One model employed a log-log transformation of [La-] and VO2 to yield [La-] threshold as proposed by Beaver et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 59: 1936-1940, 1985). The other model was a continuous exponential plus constant of the form La- = a + b[exp(cVO2)]. In 21 of 23 data sets, the mean square error (MSE) of the continuous model was less than that of the log-log model (P less than 0.001). The MSE was on average 3.5 times greater in the log-log model than in the continuous model. The residuals were randomly distributed about the line of best fit for the continuous model. In contrast, the log-log model showed a nonrandom pattern indicating an inappropriate model. As an index of the position of the [La-]-VO2 continuous model, the VO2 at which the rate of increase of [La-] equaled the rate of increase of VO2 (d[La-]/dVO2 = 1) was determined. This VO2 was 2.241 +/- 0.081 l/min, which averaged 64.6% of maximal VO2. It is proposed that this lactate slope index could be used as a relative indicator of fitness instead of the previously applied threshold concept. The change in [La-] could be better described mathematically by a continuous model rather than the threshold model of Beaver et al.\r"

The increase in flow down zone 3 is attributed to a decrease in resistance only. Recent studies indicate that, besides the pressure required to maintain flow through a vessel, there is an added pressure cost that must be overcome in order to initiate flow. These additional pressure costs are designated critical pressures (Pcrit). Because Pcrit exceed alveolar pressure, the distinction between zones in the West model becomes less secure, and the explanation for the increase in flow even in West zone 3 requires reexamination. We used two methods to test the hypothesis that the Pcrit is the pertinent backpressure to flow even in zone 3, when the pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) exceeds alveolar pressure (PA) but is less than Pcrit in the isolated canine left caudal lobe. First, PA was maintained at 5 cmH2O, and pressure flow (P-Q) characteristics were obtained in zone 2 and zone 3. Next, with PA still at 5 cmH2O, we maintained a constant flow and measured the change in pulmonary arterial pressure as Ppv was varied. Both techniques indicated that the pertinent backpressure to flow was the greater of either Pcrit or Ppv and that PA was never the pertinent backpressure to flow. Also, our results indicate no significant change in the geometry of the flow channels between zone 2 and zone 3. These findings refine the zonal model of the pulmonary circulation.\r"

The lobe was isolated, ventilated, and pump-perfused with blood at an arterial pressure (Pa) of about 50 (high pressure, HP, n = 9) or 25 Torr (low pressure, LP, n = 9). Rus/PVR, the ratio of upstream (Rus) to total lobar vascular resistance (PVR), was determined by venous occlusion and the isogravimetric capillary pressure technique. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf), an index of vascular permeability, was obtained from rate of lobe weight gain during stepwise capillary pressure (Pc) elevation. The embolized lobes became more edematous than nonembolized controls, (C, n = 11), (P less than 0.05), with Kf values of 0.20 +/- 0.04, 0.25 +/- 0.06, and 0.07 +/- 0.01 ml X min-1 X Torr-1 X 100 X g-1 in LP, HP, and C, respectively (P less than 0.05). The greater Rus/PVR in embolized lobes (P less than 0.05) protected the microvessels and, although Pc was greater in HP than in controls (P less than 0.05), Pc did not differ between HP and LP (P greater than 0.05). Although indexes of permeability did not differ between embolized groups (P greater than 0.05), HP became more edematous than LP (P less than 0.05). The greater edema in HP did not appear due to a greater imbalance of Starling forces across the microvessel wall or to vascular recruitment. At constant Pc and venous pressure, elevating Pa from 25 to 50 Torr in embolized lobes resulted in greater edema to suggest fluid filtration from precapillary vessels.\r"

While at rest, 13 heart failure patients had an average sinus heart rate that was significantly higher than seven normals (92 +/- 13 vs. 82 +/- 10 min-1, P less than 0.05). However, during exercise, the trend of increase in sinus heart rate as a function of work load and O2 uptake was significantly greater in normals compared with heart failure (P less than 0.05), and the absolute increase in heart rate at 50 W of cycle ergometry was larger in normals compared with heart failure (38 +/- 17 vs. 22 +/- 13 min-1, P less than 0.05). Differences in core temperature regulation were also observed. In the normals, core temperature increased from 37.13 +/- 0.33 degrees C at rest to 37.37 +/- 0.31 degrees C at 50 W of exercise (P less than 0.01). In the heart failure patients, core temperature decreased from 36.99 +/- 0.33 degrees C at rest to 36.66 +/- 0.39 degrees C at 50 W of exercise (P less than 0.01). As expected, significant differences in hemodynamic and gas exchange variables were observed between the normals and the heart failure patients both at rest and during exercise. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed of heart rate changes as the dependent variable and thermoregulatory and hemodynamic changes as the independent variables to test for their influence on heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this model, each of two bronchi empty parenchymal compliances through a common trachea, and each branch includes resistances upstream and downstream of a flow-limiting site. Properties of each airway are specified independently, allowing simulation of differences between the tracheal and bronchial generations and between the parallel bronchial paths. Simulations of four types of parallel asymmetry were performed: unilateral peripheral bronchoconstriction; unilateral central bronchoconstriction; asymmetric redistribution of parenchymal compliance; and unilateral alteration of the bronchial area-transmural pressure characteristic. Our results indicate that multiple axial choke points can exist simultaneously in a symmetric lung when large airway opening-pleural pressure gradients exist; despite severe nonhomogeneity of regional lung emptying, flow interdependence among parallel branches tends to maintain a near normal configuration of the overall maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve throughout a large fraction of the vital capacity; and sudden changes of slope of the MEFV curve (\"knees\" or \"bumps\") may reflect choking in one branch in a nonuniform lung, but need not be obvious even when severe heterogeneity of lung emptying exists.\r"

We hypothesized that the maximal velocity (Vmax) of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, measured from indicator-dilution outflow curves using a synthetic substrate, 3H-labeled benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP), is directly related to the capillary endothelial cell surface area in the lungs of developing lambs. Accordingly we measured apparent kinetics of pulmonary ACE activity in 22 anesthetized ventilated lambs (2-171 days old) and compared our functional assessment to simultaneous in vivo determinations of CO diffusing capacity (DLCO) and postmortem structural assessment of alveolar septal dimensions using stereology and electron microscopy. There was a progressive increase in Vmax of ACE in this age group, with little change in apparent affinity for BPAP. Similar functional manifestation of growth was noted by an age-dependent increase in DLCO. Neither Vmax nor DLCO was significantly affected by an increase in left atrial pressure to 19 Torr (via inflation of a balloon in the left atrium), suggesting little recruitment of vessels under conditions of the present protocol. A close correlation was observed when either Vmax for ACE activity or DLCO was plotted vs. capillary endothelial cell surface area. Double logarithmic transformation of capillary endothelial cell surface area, Vmax-ACE and DLCO vs. lung volume revealed power functions with slopes all greater than that predicted from isotropic growth, suggesting selective differential postnatal development of the endothelium of the alveolar septum in lambs from 2-171 days of age.\r"

Multiple indicator-dilution techniques have been used to measure pulmonary ACE activity in vivo and in isolated lungs. These studies suggest that ACE activity is depressed in several forms of acute lung injury. Depression of ACE activity may reflect impaired substrate delivery to enzyme sites because of flow-related reduction of perfused surface area. To assess the role of altered microvascular flow and surface area in the measurement of ACE activity, we utilized similar techniques to estimate the apparent Km and Vmax of pulmonary ACE in isolated, Krebs-perfused rabbit lungs. Km is an estimate of the affinity of a synthetic ACE substrate, [3H]benzoyl-phenyl-alanyl-alanyl-proline ([3H]BPAP), for ACE and should not be influenced by the rate of substrate delivery to luminal enzyme sites. Conversely, Vmax is an index of the number of ACE sites and should be influenced by perfusion changes that alter the number of perfused sites (recruitment or derecruitment). When isolated lungs were subjected to physiological maneuvers designed to increase or decrease perfused surface area, apparent Vmax increased or decreased respectively. Apparent Km was not altered by these maneuvers. Km and Vmax were independent of changes in perfusion rate when surface area was held constant. Thus these parameters should be useful in evaluating perfusion changes in normal and injured lungs.\r"

The treadmill protocol consisted of a constant-run speed with grade increments every second minute. Ventilation, VO2, and CO2 production were measured using online open-circuit spirometry. Coefficients of variation for determination of VO2max and VET were 3.4 and 5.6%, respectively. VO2max increased across age 11-15 yr, from 60.8 to 68.0 ml X kg-1 X min-1. VET at 11 yr was 34.4 and at 15 yr 41.9 ml X kg-1 X min-1, thus increasing from 56 to 62% of VO2max. Previous studies of children have shown a decline of VET relative to VO2max across age; however, in the present study the increase may have been due to the training of the boys in competitive athletics. However, the trained youth did not achieve the high relative threshold of trained adults. Across age, both VO2max and VET scaled to weight to the power 1 (in a log-log transformation). The increase in VO2max (l/min) showed greatest increments corresponding to gains in size (a growth curve), whereas increases of VET were consistent year to year. Thus VET was altered independently of VO2max. Factors other than size (and presumably muscle mass) such as the maturation of an enzymatic profile of fast glycolytic fibers might have an important influence on the threshold during youth.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of lung expansion to reflexly decrease skeletal muscle activity was tested in anesthetized dogs. In animals whose left lung was vascularly isolated but neurally intact, the left lung was inflated statically to 40 cmH2O pressure or cyclically with tidal volumes of 10, 20, or 30 ml/kg. Responses to these stimuli were compared with those of injecting 120 or 240 micrograms capsaicin into the left pulmonary artery. Skeletal muscle activity was assessed from the electromyogram (EMG) response of the left hindlimb muscles and from the monosynaptic reflex response to a periodic patellar tendon tap of the right leg (knee jerk). Static inflation and cyclic inflations above 10 ml/kg resulted in significant decreases in both EMG and knee jerk responses. The results indicate that lung expansion is capable of initiating a reflex decrease in skeletal muscle activity. Capsaicin injections caused responses that were similar to those caused by lung inflation, suggesting that at least part of this skeletal muscle reflex response to lung inflation can be attributed to the stimulation of pulmonary C-fibers that could be caused by stretch of the lung.\r"

Tension was reduced to 21 +/- 1 and 54 +/- 2% (SE) of the initial value after high- and low-frequency stimulation, respectively. After 0, 0.25, 1, and 2 min of recovery from high-frequency stimulation, 5 Hz elicited more force (expressed as % of initial tension) than 75-Hz stimulation. Time 0 recovery values were 21 +/- 1 and 78 +/- 6% of the initial force for 75- and 5-Hz stimulation, respectively. By 1 min of recovery, force elicited by 5-Hz stimulation had returned to the prefatigue value. In contrast, force production with 75-Hz stimulation did not full recover until 10-15 min. After fatigue produced by low-frequency stimulation, force production with 5-Hz stimulation was reduced to 54 +/- 2% of the initial tension, a value significantly lower than the 71 +/- 2% of initial force elicited by 75-Hz stimulation. Force production with 5-Hz stimulation increased rapidly in the first 15 s of recovery (54 +/- 2% at 0 and 70 +/- 2% at 15 s) and by 5 min was significantly greater than the force elicited by 75-Hz stimulation (100 +/- 3 vs. 93 +/- 1%). As before, force production at 75-Hz stimulation did not fully recover until 10-15 min. Both fatigue protocols produced a significant prolongation in isometric twitch contraction and one-half relaxation times. Creatine phosphate (CP) concentration was reduced and muscle lactate increased by both fatigue protocols.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87250174\r", 
  ".W": "To test hypotheses regarding relations between meaningful parameters, it is often necessary to calculate these parameters from other directly measured variables. For example, the relationship between O2 consumption and O2 delivery may be of interest, although these may be computed from measurements of cardiac output and blood O2 contents. If a measured variable is used in the calculation of two derived parameters, error in the measurement will couple the calculated parameters and introduce a bias, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. This paper presents a method of correcting for this bias in the linear regression coefficient and the Pearson correlation coefficient when calculations involve the nonlinear and linear combination of the measured variables. The general solution is obtained when the first two terms of a Taylor series expansion of the function can be used to represent the function, as in the case of multiplication. A significance test for the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is equal to zero is also presented. Physiological examples are provided demonstrating this technique, and the correction methods are also applied in simulations to verify the adequacy of the technique and to test for the magnitude of the coupling effect. In two previous studies of O2 consumption and delivery, the effect of coupled error is shown to be small when the range of O2 deliveries studied is large, and measurement errors are of reasonable size.\r"

Phosphocreatine (PCr) fell by 2.02 mM and Pi (inorganic phosphate) rose by 1.92 mM due to pHi shift from 7.10 to 6.83 during hypercapnia. The stoichiometric coefficient was 1.05 (r2 = 0.78) on log PCr/Cr against pHi, showing minimum change of ADP/ATP and equilibrium of creatine kinase in the pH range of 6.7 to 7.25. [ADP] varied from 21.6 +/- 4.1 microM in control (pHi = 7.10) to 26.8 +/- 6.3 microM in hypercapnia (pHi = 6.83) and 24.0 +/- 6.8 microM in hypocapnia (pHi = 7.17). ATP/ADP X Pi decreased from 66.4 +/- 17.1 mM-1 during normocapnia to 25.8 +/- 6.3 mM-1 in hypercapnia. The ADP values are near the in vitro Km; thus ADP is the main controller. The velocity of oxidative metabolism (V) in relation to its maximum (Vmax) as calculated by a steady-state Michaelis-Menten formulation is approximately 50% in normocapnia. In acidosis (pH 6.7) and alkalosis (pH 7.25), V/Vmax is 10% higher than the normocapnic brain. This increase of V/Vmax is required to maintain cellular homeostasis of energy metabolism in the face of either inhibition at extremes of pH or higher ATPase activity.\r"

  ".W": "During breathing under sedation via a two-way valve, airflow (V), volume (delta V), and airway pressure (P) were recorded in eight normal (N) infants, seven with reversible obstructive airway disease (ROAD), and seven with chronic lung disease (CLD). Intermittently, expiratory volume clamping (EVC) was applied, involving selective occlusion of the expiratory valve for three to five breaths. The latter produced cumulative increases in delta V that, due to progressive recruitment of the Hering-Breuer reflex, were accompanied by increasing expiratory plateaus in P (i.e., apneas). The resultant passive inflation delta V-P relationships were closely approximated by the expression: delta V = aP2 + bP + c, wherein a represented the pressure-related changes in chord compliance (Crs), b the Crs at P = 0, and c the difference between the dynamic end-expiratory and relaxation volumes of the respiratory system. Relative to N, the ROAD and CLD infants had significantly reduced weight-specific values of a/kg, their b/kg values were increased, whereas the c/kg measurements did not significantly vary. Moreover, for each subject we determined the net Crs/kg obtaining at P = 20 cmH2O (i.e., Crs20/kg), an estimate of the net deflation compliance; the passive respiratory time constant (tau rs) based on the slope of the expired delta V/V relationship; and the respiratory system conductance (Grs/kg). Relative to N, the mean Crs20/kg was significantly reduced only in the infants with CLD and, due to increases in tau rs, both patient groups depicted significantly diminished values of Grs/kg, suggesting the presence of airways obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The usual method of measuring density dependence of maximum expiratory flows is superimposition at total lung capacity or residual volume of maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curves obtained breathing air and a mixture of 80% He plus 20% O2 (HeO2). A major problem with this technique is the large variability in results, which has been thought to be due to errors in matching lung volumes on both gases. Accordingly, we obtained MEFV curves breathing air and HeO2 using a bag-in-the-box system so that the curves breathing the two gas mixtures could be directly superimposed without removing the mouthpiece (isovolume). Ten healthy, nonsmoking subjects performed MEFV curves on each gas mixture for six consecutive experiments. We compared the increase in flow at 50% of vital capacity (delta Vmax50) and volume of isoflow (Viso) by superimposing and matching the MEFV curves at total lung capacity, at residual volume, and using the isovolume method. The variability of each method was assessed by the mean intersubject and intrasubject coefficients of variation. In all subjects, the mean delta Vmax50 and Viso as well as their corresponding coefficients of variation were not significantly different among the three methods. We conclude that, in healthy nonsmoking young adults, the method chosen for superimposing and matching MEFV curves has no effect on the variability of delta Vmax50 and Viso.\r"

All patients were followed for a minimum of two years after the last arthroplasty. The elbow had been operated on first in twenty-one extremities and the shoulder had been operated on first in fourteen. The time-interval between arthroplasties was significantly longer (p less than 0.005) when the elbow had been operated on first (forty-five compared with 13.4 months). All motion of the elbow and elevation and external rotation of the shoulder improved significantly (p less than 0.005), similar to the improvement in motion that is noted when either joint is operated on alone. Also, there was a highly significant reduction in pain and improvement in function (both, p less than 0.001). Review of the roentgenograms of twenty-three patients demonstrated no humeral fractures or interference in the proper placement of the humeral component of the prosthesis either by the stem of the other prosthesis or by the methylmethacrylate. All of the arthroplasties of the shoulder that were performed as the second arthroplasty were done at least five months after the arthroplasty of the elbow, and no dislocations or subluxations of the components of the elbow prosthesis occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of the patients were more than twenty-five years old at operation and had been followed for more than three years. Every patient who was operated on by one of us (J. E. H.) and who met these criteria was evaluated. The magnitude of the curves averaged 66 degrees. Standardized gradations of pain and function showed improvement over-all, but significant impairment remained. There was a reduction in the levels of peak and constant pain, but no change in the frequency of peak pain after operation. The number of patients who were pain-free after surgery was not increased. Functional impairment due to the scoliosis was lessened, and the ability to perform the common activities of daily living was improved, but no important changes in occupation or recreational activity were recorded. Correlations of pain or function, or both, and the changes in either, were found with only two parameters: age at follow-up and physical occupation. Pulmonary function, as measured, did not change. Eighteen (40 per cent) of the patients had a minor complication and ten (20 per cent), a major complication; there was one death, due to pulmonary embolism, of a patient who was excluded from the series. In view of the high rate of complications, the limited gains to be derived from spinal fusion should be assessed and clearly explained to patients before the procedure is undertaken.\r"

Arthrography of the shoulder was done for each of these twenty-three patients, and fifteen were found to have a tear of the rotator cuff. Five of the thirty-one patients were found to have aseptic necrosis of the head of the humerus. We also measured the intra-articular pressure in the shoulder in five patients during different activities, including transfer from wheelchair to bed, and found that this pressure exceeded the arterial pressure by two and one-half times. We believe that this high pressure, in conjunction with abnormal distribution of stress transmitted across the subacromial area during transfer or propulsion of a wheelchair, contributes to the high rate of problems about the shoulder in paraplegics.\r"

No patient had an injury to the distal tibiofibular ligaments or to the syndesmosis.

The delta frame (two rods connecting or triangulating two half-frames set at an angle of 45 degrees to one another) was as rigid as the quadrilateral full frame in axial compression; however, it exhibited low loads to yield and to failure, with means around 200 and 350 newtons, respectively. The use of only two pins in each pin-cluster did not significantly affect the performance of the delta frame. The two full-frame systems performed poorly in torsion and particularly poorly in anterior-posterior bending. The loads that caused a one-millimeter movement within the fracture gap in axial compression were notably low: for the stacked half-frames the load did not exceed a mean value of 174 newtons; for the double half-frame, 190 newtons; and for the quadrilateral frame, 412 newtons. We concluded that no frame had a good over-all performance with regard to rigidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-one non-unions were the result of fracture and two, secondary to osteotomy. Twenty non-unions were located in the middle third of the clavicle, while three were in the lateral third. Radiographically, eighteen non-unions were atrophic and three, hypertrophic. Two non-unions resembled pseudarthrosis. Of the etiological factors that were reviewed the extent of displacement of the original fracture was the most significant. Associated complications of the non-union included limited mobility of the shoulder in fourteen, neurological symptoms in eight, thoracic outlet syndrome in four, and arterial ischemia in one. Of the nineteen patients who were treated to obtain union, seventeen had a successful result at an average length of follow-up of 23.8 months. In sixteen (93.7 per cent) of the seventeen patients union was achieved by fixation with a plate; one patient required two procedures. Ancillary bone graft was used in eighteen patients, with three requiring a sculptured bicortical graft from the iliac crest to span a defect. Of the four other patients three were treated with a partial clavicular resection and one, with complete clavicectomy.\r"

When distal interlocking was performed, the first ring was removed and a second ring was used so that a separate recording could be made for this portion of the procedure. At the conclusion of the study, all of the recorded doses of radiation were averaged. The average amount of radiation to the head and neck during the entire procedure was 7.0 millirems of deep exposure and 8.0 millirems of shallow exposure. The average dose of radiation to the dominant hand during insertion of the intramedullary nail and the proximal interlocking screw was 13.0 millirems, while the average amount during insertion of the distal interlocking nail was 12.0 millirems. Both of these averages are well within the government guidelines for allowable exposure to radiation during one-quarter (three months) of a year. Precautions that are to be observed during this procedure are recommended.\r"

  ".W": "In eighty patients who were seen with Paget's disease of the hip between 1969 and 1982, symptomatic coxarthrosis led to total hip arthroplasty in ninety-one hips. The long-term clinical and radiographic results were analyzed by use of the Mayo Clinic hip-scoring system. The cases of the forty-six patients (fifty-two hips) who had been operated on before 1975 were analyzed ten years after the arthroplasty. In this group, the incidence of aseptic loosening that required revision was approximately 15 per cent; radiographic evidence of loosening was evident in approximately 30 per cent of the femoral components and approximately 14 per cent of the acetabular components. Actuarial analysis comparing these forty-six patients with our over-all experience of total hip arthroplasty during the same period of time in 7,222 hips of patients who did not have Paget's disease revealed an increase of slight statistical significance in the incidence of revision for aseptic loosening in the patients who had Paget's disease. However, the over-all result was good or excellent in 74 per cent of these patients, suggesting that replacement of the hip using cemented components remains an acceptable form of treatment for degenerative coxarthrosis secondary to Paget's disease.\r"

Unfortunately, of the nine Type-IIIC injuries, seven ultimately required secondary amputation, from two days to sixty-three months after the initial injury, because of pain, sepsis, non-union, or failure of the vascular repair. Only two patients who had a Type-IIIC fracture have avoided amputation to date, and their results were poor.\r"

All but four patients had stage-III or IV osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The median age at operation was forty-three years, and the median length of follow-up was fifty-seven months. Ratings were good or excellent for all but three total hip arthroplasties at a mean of sixty-six months of follow-up. Complications included delayed wound-healing (in approximately 15 per cent) and superficial wound infection (in approximately 10 per cent). The occurrence of these complications could not be correlated with the use of corticosteroids at the time of the operation. Twenty-five per cent of the patients, who were a mean of forty-three years old at operation, died less than five years postoperatively from complications related to systemic lupus erythematosus. Conclusions regarding the systemic effects of hip arthroplasty in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus could not be drawn on the basis of this study. Total hip arthroplasty uniformly provided a good or excellent result in patients of all ages who had systemic lupus erythematosus at a mean length of follow-up of sixty-six months. An increased incidence of local wound complications, which were unrelated to the use of corticosteroids, should be expected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who undergo prosthetic arthroplasty of the hip.\r"

Bone wax was used to generate high intramedullary pressures without the use of bone cement. In the group with the non-cemented implant, few pulmonary microemboli and no significant cardiorespiratory changes were found. In the groups that received bone wax and an implant or the cemented implant, there were many pulmonary microemboli and significant cardiorespiratory changes, including decreased arterial oxygen tension, increased pulmonary arterial pressure, and increased intrapulmonary shunt fraction. There was no evidence that methylmethacrylate monomer was responsible for the cardiorespiratory changes in the group with the cemented implant.\r"

The indications for surgery were occipitocervical instability, neurological deficit, or intractable pain that was not responsive to non-operative treatment. Of the thirteen patients, eight had rheumatoid arthritis, two had atlanto-axial osteomyelitis, and one patient each had trauma, ankylosing spondylitis, and atlanto-occipital osteoarthritis. At follow-up, all of the thirteen patients had a solid arthrodesis and relief of severe pain in the neck. Of the ten patients who had had myelopathy preoperatively, all improved, but of four patients who had been unable to walk preoperatively because of severe motor involvement, only one was considered to be able to walk. Of the thirteen patients, ten had a satisfactory result. Occipitocervical arthrodesis using iliac grafts and the wiring technique that is described herein achieves immediate stable fixation, allowing early mobilization with a successful arthrodesis, and it should be undertaken before severe myelopathy occurs in patients who have instability of the cervical spine. The operation may optimize the patient's chances of neurological recovery.\r"

Two of the patients also had a Van Nes rotationplasty and two had a Syme amputation. The Syme amputation produced better results. Distal epiphyseodesis of the ipsilateral femur also was performed in three of the four patients to minimize the anterior prominence of the knee.

The goals of the combined procedure were to increase correction of the curve and decrease the rate of pseudarthrosis. Preoperatively, the major curves measured an average of 83 degrees, and on the best side-bend they averaged 59 degrees, a 29 per cent degree of flexibility. At the time of discharge from the hospital the curves had improved to an average of 44 degrees, a correction of the preoperative curve of 39 degrees or 47 per cent. At an average length of follow-up of forty-nine months, the major curves measured an average of 50 degrees, a 41 per cent correction compared with the initial curves. Twenty-three of the major curves were better than when they were measured on the preoperative radiograph of the best side-bend, by an average of 15 degrees, but eight curves were either the same or worse. No patient had pseudarthrosis or permanent neurological injury. It is our conclusion that a two-stage anterior and posterior fusion is of value for the treatment of the adult who has a rigid curve that requires maximum correction to allow the head, shoulders, and torso to be centered over the pelvis. We do not recommend the use of instrumentation for the anterior fusion as this did not increase the correction of the curve in this series of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight patients who had scoliosis or kyphosis of varying etiologies were followed for a minimum of two years (average, forty-four months) after segmental spinal instrumentation using sublaminar wires. In eight (19 per cent) of the patients who had been operated on for scoliosis one or both rods broke. The average time that had elapsed before the breakage was discovered was twenty-three months. None of the patients in whom a rod had broken had had postoperative immobilization or a first-stage anterior fusion, and only one had had supplementary grafting with banked bone. Instrumentation to the pelvis was also associated with a greater incidence of broken rods. The use of supplementary grafting with banked bone or the use of postoperative immobilization significantly decreased the loss of postoperative correction. Preliminary anterior spinal fusion helped prevent breakage of rods but not loss of correction. It was concluded that postoperative immobilization and use of large amounts of supplementary bone graft lead to better results when using this implant system.\r"

The preoperative diagnosis was osteoarthritis in thirty-three shoulders, rheumatoid arthritis in eleven, and a previous fracture of the humeral head in six shoulders. Nine of the shoulders had a tear of the rotator cuff. The Neer-II system of total shoulder replacement with a non-metal-backed component was used in all fifty shoulders. At follow-up, forty-four shoulders (88 per cent) had no significant pain. Of the six painful shoulders, four had loosening of the glenoid component and one had malposition of both components. Three of the six shoulders had no significant pain after revision. The average range of active forward elevation in all of the shoulders improved from 71 to 100 degrees, and both external and internal rotation improved as well. Five specific activities of daily living were evaluated, and the patients' ability to perform them improved from 14 to 78 per cent. Thirty-five shoulders (68 per cent) were rated by the patients as much better; thirteen shoulders (26 per cent), as better; and three (6 per cent), as no better. An incomplete lucent line was noted around five (10 per cent) of the cemented humeral stems and around thirty-seven (74 per cent) of the glenoid prostheses. Four arthroplasties (8 per cent) required revision: three for loosening of the glenoid component and one for malposition of both components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The long axis was defined as a line from the center of the femoral head to the anterolateral attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament. The transverse axis was defined as a line through the posterior cruciate ligament parallel to the line connecting each epicondyle. The condylar width, the length of each interepicondylar line, correlated well with depth, but the projections of the condyles from the transverse plane revealed significant variations from specimen to specimen. Considerable variation also was found between femora in terms of angular dimensions (that is, the angle of anteversion and the neck-shaft angle proximally, and the valgus angle of the femoral shaft distally). Considerable interspecimen variation in the angles between the transcondylar plane and the femoral center, in accord with the valgus angle of the femoral shaft distally, was also noted. The mean transcondylar valgus angle (described as the tangent of the condyles to the perpendicular of the long axis) was 3.8 degrees. In contrast, little variation among specimens was noted for the angle made by the shaft and the long axis.\r"

After an average length of follow-up of forty-six months, roentgenograms of the distal joint in twenty-six digits appeared essentially normal. Ten digits had minor roentgenographic changes but, with the exception of one digit, the joint space was congruous and free of significant abnormalities. The average loss of extension of the distal joint was 2 degrees, and the average arc of flexion of the distal joint was 69 degrees. The average strength of pinch in all digits that were operated on was essentially equal to the strength of pinch in the contralateral digit. Exact reduction and internal fixation using the technique described resulted in excellent motion and function.\r"

  ".U": "87250744\r", 
  ".W": "A modified Bristow-Helfet-May procedure was performed for recurrent dislocation or subluxation of the glenohumeral joint in 207 patients (212 shoulders), whose average age at the time of surgery was 20.3 years (range, fourteen to forty-seven years). The procedure was modified by directing the coracoid segment and conjoined tendon over the superior border rather than through the substance of the subscapularis tendon and muscle. The indications were either documented recurrent anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint or subluxation with instability as demonstrated on examination with the patient under anesthesia. The procedure was evaluated on the basis of the rate of recurrence of dislocation and subluxation, postoperative complications, the patients' subjective evaluation, and the effect of the procedure on the motion of the glenohumeral joint and the strength of the muscles of the shoulder as related to overhead throwing. Eight (3.8 per cent) of the shoulders redislocated and ten (4.7 per cent) had one or more subjective episodes of subluxation after the procedure. Complications included postoperative infection in two patients and problems with the screw that required its removal in ten. One hundred and thirty-one (62 per cent) of the patients responded to a questionnaire regarding their subjective evaluation of the results of surgery. Eleven (8 per cent) were unable to perform daily activities that involved overhead work, and forty-five (34 per cent) stated that they still had some degree of discomfort or pain in the shoulder. One hundred and twenty-six patients (96.2 per cent) stated that they were happy with the results of the surgery and would have the procedure again. Thirty patients had Cybex testing of the muscles of the shoulder. Only three (16 per cent) of the nineteen athletes whose dominant arm had been operated on returned to their pre-injury level of throwing. Data obtained with regard to changes in the range of motion and strength of the glenohumeral joint indicate that this loss of throwing ability was not due solely to a loss of glenohumeral motion. It appeared to be also related to a concomitant loss of strength at the extreme of external rotation of the humerus and the initiation of internal rotation of the humerus.\r"

A test of maximum exercise on the ergometer and a test of walking on a treadmill were administered before and after training. After training, there was an increase of 25 per cent in the maximum capacity for exercise on the ergometer as well as significantly lower values for heart rate and consumption of oxygen during submaximum walking on the treadmill at various inclined grades. Aerobic conditioning was shown not only to improve cardiovascular fitness but also to increase the economy of walking in the subject who had an amputation of the lower limb or limbs.\r"

  ".W": "Profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest is a well worked out technique for total repair of congenital defects in infants. Recently, it has been popularized for the repair of aneurysms of the transverse aortic arch. We have applied this technique of profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in three other adult patients in whom conventional techniques would not allow safe and adequate complete repair of acquired intra-cardiac defects. The first patient, a 76-year-old female, had a large chronic ascending aortic aneurysm involving the aortic valve, as well as the innominate and left common carotid arteries. Resuspension of the aortic valve, resection of the ascending aneurysm, and reconstruction of the ascending and transverse aorta were performed under profound circulatory arrest. In addition, multi-dose hypothermic blood K+ cardioplegia was utilized to protect the myocardium. The second patient underwent valve replacement during a period of circulatory arrest because of extensive calcification of the entire ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch. Arrest time was 56 minutes. The third patient was a 54-year-old female and had a large patent ductus arteriosus with a 3:1 left-to-right shunt as well as significant aortic and mitral valve disease. The ductus was closed through an incision in the pulmonary artery during a 13-minute period of profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest. Aortic valve replacement and mitral repair were also performed at the same time, utilizing conventional techniques. All three patients recovered uneventfully with no evidence of any significant neurologic defect. Long-term follow-up has shown improvement in functional classification in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No associated procedures were performed in these patients in whom a variety of prostheses was employed. The valve behaviour has been compared with other xenograft series, homografts and synthetic prostheses. There was a 5.5% hospital death rate and a 7.5% late mortality. Five late deaths were valve related, five were unrelated to the valve and four were of unknown cause but in elderly patients. At eight years, 86.1% of patients were alive, the majority functionally improved. Thromboembolic events were considerably fewer than those experienced with most non-biological prostheses, all but three events being transient. Re-operation for primary valve dysfunction was a safe procedure but re-operation for infected prostheses carried a high mortality. In comparing the aortic xenograft with other prostheses, severe dysfunction was found to occur with similar frequency in all prostheses up to eight years and was rare. Mild prosthetic dysfunction (asymptomatic diastolic murmur) occurs in about 25% of all tissue valves at eight years, including the homograft. The progression, or otherwise, of mild dysfunction has yet to be evaluated in currently available xenograft prostheses.\r"

Two patients died in the first postoperative month (5.4%). Most late deaths were of cardiac origin. 85% of all deaths were in Functional Class IV. Five and ten year actuarial survival rate was 75% and 58% for the entire group. Twenty three long-term survivors were followed; all were improved for at least one Functional Class (p = 0.001). Moderate but significant (p = 0.05) cardiothoracic ratio regression was observed. Seven patients had postoperative non lethal complications. In summary, when necessary, triple valve replacement carried an excellent symptomatic improvement. Surgical intervention before patients reach Functional Class IV is preferable. The use of bioprosthesis in tricuspid position is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this report is to present a 5 year experience in electrophysiologically guided surgical treatment of post-infarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a consecutive series of 39 patients. In every case the arrhythmia was not responsive to pluripharmacological therapy. The diagnostic steps included preoperative endocardial, intraoperative epi- and endocardial mapping, automatically carried out when possible. Surgical techniques were: classic Guiraudon's encircling endocardial ventriculotomy (EEV), partial EEV, endocardial resection (ER), cryoablation or combined procedures. The hospital mortality was of 4 patients (10%). During the follow-up period (1-68 mo), 4 patients (11%) died of cardiac non-VT related causes. Among the survivors, 90% are in sinus rhythm. The authors consider electrophysiologically guided surgery a safe and reliable method for the treatment of post-infarction VT and suggest more extensive indications. They stress the importance of automatic mapping in pleomorphic and non-sustained VT, and the necessity of tailoring the surgical technique to the characteristics of each case.\r"

Survival factors included age (mean 18 years), transportation lag (mean distance 2 miles), wounding agents (shrapnel, gunshot), hospital logistics, and early surgical treatment. The overall survival was 73% (208 patients) compared to 60% from World War II and 67% from recent civilian report. Treatment logistics included a specialized centre with ambulance radio communication. The state of shock at arrival influenced survival: 146 of 188 patients with mild shock survived (78%) with 61% (53 patients) survival in the profound shock group, treated similarly. The site of cardiac injury influenced outcome. Survival was best in the 9 patients with coronary vessel wounds (100%), atrial wounds 80% (56 survivors) but dropped to 46% (17 survivors) in left ventricular injury reflecting pump failure, and 51% (19 survivors) in multiple cardiac wounds. The causes of cardiac mortality and survivor follow-up were evaluated. The study indicates that despite predetermined factors overall survival is significantly improved by early transportation, precise logistics, and urgent surgery.\r"

This low prime device transfers large volumes of gas, an efficiency which results from a crossed arrangement of the fibers to break up laminar flow of the blood around them. The low priming volume makes it appropriate for use in all but the smallest patients.\r"

  ".W": "Paraplegia has been a devastating and unpredictable complication following cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta. In this study, the effect of the pressure gradient between the aortic pressure distal to occlusion and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), defined as relative spinal cord perfusion pressure (RSPP), on the development of spinal cord injury was investigated. In 32 mongrel dogs, the thoracic aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery was cross-clamped. After a complete loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) had been confirmed, the dogs were divided into six groups by an additional cross-clamp interval and RSPP as follows: Group I (n = 6): 0 mmHg for 10 minutes; Group II (n = 8): 0 mmHg for 20 minutes; Group III (n = 3): 7.5 mmHg for 20 minutes; Group IV (n = 3): 7.5 mmHg for 40 minutes; Group V (n = 6): 15 mmHg for 40 minutes and Group VI (n = 6): 15 mmHg for 60 minutes. RSPP was adjusted by either withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid or injection of normal saline solution into the subarachnoid space. SEP were generated by the stimulation of bilateral peroneal nerves. The incidence of postoperative paraplegia was 0% in Groups I and V, 33% in Group III, 50% in Group VI and 100% in Groups II and IV. This study showed that RSPP plays an important role in the development of spinal cord injury during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta. Therefore, RSPP should be maintained at as high a level as possible in order to prevent spinal cord injury even if SEP disappear during aortic occlusion.\r"

The second patient, had a simple division of the anomalous vessel through a left posterolateral thoracotomy, but developed a subclavian steal syndrome. These symptoms were relieved by anastomosing the stump of the artery to the ascending aorta with the use of a graft.

During the first five years, 22 patients had either a 13 X 6.5 mm or a 14 X 7 mm knitted Dacron graft and served as historic controls for a second group of 20 others who had 14 X 7 mm grafts of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), during the last three years of the study. Although the two groups were neither concurrent nor randomized, they were nonetheless well matched with regard to age, sex, risk factors, indications for operations, distribution and severity of distal occlusive disease, and type of distal anastomosis. There was only one early graft limb occlusion in the PTFE group after a median follow-up of 14 months, compared to nine occlusions and one amputation in the Dacron group after a median follow-up of 26.2 months. The cumulative patency of the PTFE grafts was 95% at four years compared to only 52% for Dacron (p = 0.11). If the single postoperative occlusion which occurred in each group is excluded, then the difference in patency rates bordered on statistical significance (p = 0.06). Inclusion of the profunda femoris orifice in the distal anastomosis was also found to be an important factor contributing to long-term patency which approached statistical significance (p = 0.075). The configuration of the proximal aortic anastomosis (end to end vs. end to side), or the concomitant use of lumbar sympathectomy or the postoperative infusion of Dextran did not have a statistically significant influence on patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fibrous cell infiltration was not extensive enough to be harmful. Elastic fibers were relatively preserved, with some dissociation. No endothelialization, infection, thrombosis, or aneurysm dilatation was detected. Angiographic control up to 37 months showed patency and normal internal surface of the graft. It appears from this study that bovine pericardium is a good alternative as a vascular graft material.\r"

The lesson which cannot be over emphasized is that probably all calf masses of obscure aetiology in patients over the age of 40, whether silent or not, big or small, ought to have a femoral arteriogram performed prior to surgery. The literature on this rare condition is also reviewed.\r"

The likelihood secondary infection is not established. A review of 428 wounds following dissection of the femoral artery was undertaken, with analysis of resulting wound drainage. Lymphatic drainage occurred in 5% of groin wounds. Diabetes, infection of the operated leg or foot and use of prosthetic graft were associated with statistically insignificant increases in risk. Reoperation was associated with a statistically insignificant decrease in risk. Most drainage stopped spontaneously. In 40% of patients with drainage, protracted lymphorrhea contributing to morbidity and hospital stay resulted. This outcome was unlikely in the absence of prosthetic graft. Such patients may benefit from surgical exploration of the wound and ligation of lymphatic tissue. Graft infection was not observed. While infection was an infrequent secondary complication, bacteriologic monitoring and antibiotic therapy are essential in cases of prolonged drainage.\r"

TcPO2 sensors were placed adjacent to venous ulcers on lower limbs and on the chest and foot of each patient.

TcPO2 values were markedly decreased in skin adjacent to the ulcers (10 +/- 2 mmHg) compared with those of the chest (64 +/- 2 mmHg) and foot (43 +/- 2 mmHg). Inhalation of 100% oxygen for 10 minutes increased chest TcPO2 in all patients (145 +/- 8 mmHg) and increased TcPO2 in skin around the ulcers in 17 of 18 patients (61 +/- 13 mmHg).

A 27-yr-old woman initially was diagnosed as having Cushing's disease, based on the findings of high plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels, increased urinary cortisol secretion, resistance to adrenal suppression with dexamethasone, and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia by computed tomography and scintigraphy of the adrenal glands. However, she had no signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. During a 5-yr follow-up, no clinical abnormalities developed, although hypercortisolism persisted. End-organ resistance to cortisol was suspected. To explain the end-organ resistance to cortisol, the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from a forearm skin biopsy were characterized and compared with the results of similar studies in normal subjects. The patient's GR in whole cell assays had an increased dissociation constant (Kd). In the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient, there was also decreased binding capacity. The thermal stability and the sedimentation coefficient in a sucrose density gradient of the receptors in the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient and normal subjects were similar. GR complex activation, analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, was decreased in the patient. DNA binding of the GR complex after temperature-induced activation was lower in the patient than in normal subjects. Nuclear translocation of GR complexes from the patient was also slightly decreased. These results suggest that the patient's glucocorticoid resistance was due to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for glucocorticoids and a decrease in the binding of the GR complex to DNA.\r"

Three of these women were studied in both phases, yielding a total of nine control studies. In the PCO patients the mean LH pulse frequency was 12.1 +/- 0.7 (+/- SE) pulses/12 h. This value was indistinguishable from that of normal EF (12.1 +/- 0.4 pulses/12 h) or MF women (12.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/12 h). In contrast, the mean LH pulse amplitude in the PCO patients (12.2 +/- 2.7 mIU/mL) was higher (P less than 0.05) than that in normal women in either phase (EF, 6.2 +/- 0.8 mIU/mL; MF, 6.4 +/- 0.6 mIU/mL).

  ".W": "The syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is due to a defect at the level of target tissues, but its diagnosis is currently based on indirect tests and cumbersome clinical observations. We recently reported that physiological amounts of T3 inhibit fibronectin (Fn) synthesis by human fibroblasts derived from normal donors. The aim of this study was to assess if this observation could be used for the direct tissue diagnosis of GRTH. Skin fibroblasts from seven normal subjects and seven patients with GRTH were grown to confluence and then exposed for 3 days to medium supplemented with 10% thyroidectomized bovine serum with or without added T3. Cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h, and the combined medium and cell lysate was examined for the incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid and anti-Fn-precipitable material, followed by analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 35S activity in the 230K protein was corrected for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S activity. To assess the selectivity of the T3 effect on Fn in fibroblasts from normal subjects compared to GRTH patients, the responses of Fn to dexamethasone and Na butyrate were also determined. Addition of 10(-9) and 10(-7) M T3 to the medium (free T3, 6 X 10(-12) and 2 X 10(-9) M, respectively) reduced Fn synthesis by 13.2 +/- 3.2% (+/- SD) and 14.3 +/- 8.2%, respectively, in fibroblasts from patients with GRTH, an effect significantly less (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.005) than the 22.2 +/- 7.4% and 30.2 +/- 5.0% reduction that occurred in fibroblasts from normal subjects. With the exception of one patient with GRTH, individual values from each of the two groups did not overlap; the clinical studies suggested that this patient had a milder form of GRTH. In contrast, dexamethasone and sodium butyrate stimulated Fn synthesis by 25.6 +/- 8.7% and 268 +/- 125%, respectively, in fibroblasts from patients with GRTH compared to 27.6 +/- 7.2% and 304 +/- 125% in fibroblasts from normal subjects. The difference of the responses between the two groups was not significant. The results indicate that measurement of the response of Fn to T3 in cultured fibroblasts can be used for the tissue diagnosis of GRTH.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that thymic endocrine function is under neuroendocrine control. Recently, a positive correlation was found between plasma thymulin (a major endocrine product of thymus) and serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Low serum thyroid hormone concentrations are frequently found in premature newborn infants. In this study we measured plasma thymulin by bioassay and serum T3 and T4 in a series of healthy fullterm newborns and in premature infants with various disorders. The study subjects were 26 healthy fullterm infants, 23 fullterm small for gestational age infants, 30 preterm appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants, 22 preterm small for gestational age infants and 30 infants with respiratory distress syndrome, of whom 15 were fullterm and 15 were preterm AGA. Blood samples were obtained 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40 days after delivery. In the healthy fullterm infants plasma thymulin concentrations were low during the first days of life and subsequently increased, reaching normal values for children aged 1-12 months by the 10th day after birth. Persistently low plasma thymulin and serum T3 levels were found in the majority of infants with pathological conditions; the lowest values for both hormones were found in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. A highly significant positive correlation was present in all groups between mean plasma thymulin and serum T3, but not T4. Short term T3 administration in 6 additional preterm AGA infants caused a significant increase in plasma thymulin titers compared to those in 6 untreated infants. We conclude that plasma thymulin is decreased in premature newborns with the low T3 syndrome and that this abnormality may be reversed by administration of T3. These findings indicate that thymic endocrine activity is modulated by thyroid function in early postnatal life.\r"

All patients were prepubertal and had elevated gonadotropin levels. Growth velocity increased from 3.09 +/- 1.05 (+/-SD) to 7.09 +/- 1.47 cm/yr in the first 6 months, 6.08 +/- 1.78 cm/yr in the second 6 months, and 4.03 +/- 1.65 cm/yr in the third 6 months. Bone age increased a mean of 0.82 +/- 0.34, 0.89 +/- 0.79, and 0.74 +/- 0.59 yr, respectively, in the three 6-month periods. Predicted height prognosis did not change after any period. All patients had pubertal changes, limited in most to slight breast development. Mean diurnal spontaneous GH secretion did not change during treatment. Plasma somatomedin-C levels were low before treatment, and ethinyl estradiol did not significantly increase somatomedin-C values. Our data confirm the ability of a low dose of ethinyl estradiol to increase growth velocity in girls with Turner's syndrome, although the effect diminished with time, and the excess bone age advancement precluded improvement of predicted height.\r"

  ".W": "Serum TSH, as measured by a sensitive assay, and serum free T4 and T3, as measured by an ultrafiltration technique, were compared in 14 euthyroid patients with multinodular goiter and 14 normal subjects. T4 and T3 turnover studies also were performed, using the single injection, noncompartmental approach. The goitrous patients had serum free T3 levels within the normal range, but their median serum T3 level was increased compared to that in the normal subjects [goitrous patients, 5.48 pmol/L (range, 4.41-9.03); normal subjects, 4.12 pmol/L (range, 2.58-5.78); P less than 0.01]. The T3 production rate (PR) also was elevated in the patients (median, 39.4 nmol/day X 70 kg; range, 28.7-70.5) compared to that in the normal subjects 31.1 nmol/day X 70 kg; range, 24.4-45.2); P less than 0.05). No differences were found between the two groups with regard to serum free T4 levels or T4 PRs. Serum TSH levels in the patients were reduced (median, 0.20 mU/L; range, less than 0.05-1.6) compared to those in normal subjects (1.8 mU/L; range, 0.36-5.1; P less than 0.01). A significant inverse correlation was found between serum TSH levels and free T3 levels (r = 0.70; P less than 0.001), whereas serum TSH did not correlate with serum free T4 or the PR of T4 or T3. Our data suggest that clinically and biochemically euthyroid patients with multinodular goiter have slight T3 hyperproduction, and TSH secretion in the patients studied was more closely related to serum free T3 levels than to serum free T4 levels or the T3 or T4 PR.\r"

Using crude membrane preparations, specific binding for [125I] EGF was found in normal rat and human pituitaries. Equilibrium was reached at 25 C in 40 min. There was no change in the Kd values between male rats [Kd, 0.65 +/- 0.35 nM (mean +/- SD)] and female rats (Kd, 0.51 +/- 0.15 nM), while the maximum capacity was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in male rats (21 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein) than in female rats (10 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein). Scatchard analysis of the data suggested the presence of a single class of binding sites. In the three normal human pituitaries tested, specific [125I]EGF binding was also demonstrated. However, both the Kd and the maximum capacity varied widely. Twenty-two human pituitary adenomas were tested, but no specific binding was detected in any of them. In addition to the binding experiments, a radioreceptor assay using rat liver membranes was developed to detect EGF or EGF-like material in extracts of six human pituitary adenomas (two of each type). No EGF activity was detected in any of the extracts. From these results, we conclude that EGF-binding sites are present in normal pituitary tissue, suggesting a physiological role for EGF in this tissue. Consequently, the reason(s) for the lack of EGF binding in pituitary adenoma membranes is not known.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to surgery in 25 patients with atherosclerotic heart disease undergoing myocardial revascularization. The patients were all premedicated with diazepam, and general anesthesia was induced with thiopental. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups: I) no dexamethasone (DEX), enflurane anesthesia, II) 40 mg DEX, iv, 45-60 min before sternotomy, enflurane anesthesia, III) no DEX, fentanyl [N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidyl)propionanilide] anesthesia (50-100 micrograms/kg), and IV) DEX, fentanyl anesthesia. Isokalemic hemodilution of significant magnitude occurred during cardiopulmonary bypass. All groups had significant increases in plasma ACTH during surgery, which returned to control levels 22 h after the bypass. Group I (no DEX, no fentanyl) and group III (no DEX, fentanyl) patients had large similar increases in plasma ACTH, which peaked 2-4 h postbypass [400 +/- 83 (+/- SEM) pg/mL; 88 +/- 18 pmol/L]. The group II (DEX, no fentanyl) patients also had large increases in ACTH which were similar to those in groups I and III, except 2-4 h postbypass (183 +/- 91 pg/mL; 40 +/- 20 pmol/L). The group IV (DEX, fentanyl) patients had a significantly attenuated ACTH response to surgery; the mean plasma ACTH level 2-4 h postbypass was only 54 +/- 21 pg/mL (12 +/- 5 pmol/L). Therefore, although DEX or fentanyl alone had a minimal effect on the ACTH response to surgery, a significant attenuation occurred when DEX and fentanyl were used in combination. We conclude that glucocorticoids and morphine agonists exert interactive inhibitory effects on ACTH release in humans, probably by virtue of their suppression of CRH release from the hypothalamus.\r"

The recent purification of hPRL in significant quantities made it possible to measure the clearance and volume of distribution directly. Studies were also carried out to determine absorption and clearance after im injection. In five normal men whose endogenous PRL secretion was suppressed by dopamine, a loading dose of hPRL (70-90 micrograms) followed by a constant infusion (1.39-2.9 ng/min) produced steady state serum PRL levels of 15.2-25.4 ng/mL by 30-60 min. The calculated mean volume of distribution was 7.3 +/- 2.9 (+/- SD) L. The calculated MCR was 71 +/- 19 mL/min X m2, and the calculated production rate was 802 +/- 377 micrograms/24 h X m2. The plasma disappearance half-life following discontinuation of the infusion was 37 +/- 10 min. The PRL infusate consisted primarily (75.6%) of a 22.5 K dalton species, probably PRL monomer, a component eluting at 45K daltons (16.1% of the total radioimmunoreactivity), probably dimer, and a small amount of a larger mol wt species. Serum obtained during dopamine infusion but before hPRL infusion contained 68.1% of the 22.5K, 7.2% of the 45K, and 24.7% of the larger mol wt moieties. During hPRL infusion in two men there was a relative decrease in the proportion of PRL monomer to 55% and 69% and a relative increase in the PRL dimer to 33% and 18%, respectively. hPRL was injected im in doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 micrograms/kg without prior dopamine infusion. No significant changes in serum PRL levels occurred after the 1 and 2 micrograms/kg doses (n = 5). After the 4 micrograms/kg dose (n = 8), mean serum PRL levels rose from 10.0 +/- 1.8 (+/- SEM) ng/mL to peak levels of 13.1 +/- 1.8 ng/mL (P less than 0.01). After the 8 micrograms/kg dose (n = 7), PRL levels rose from 9.3 +/- 1.6 to 16.5 +/- 1.8 ng/mL (P less than 0.01). The PRL rise began between 60 and 80 min after injection; peak levels occurred at 160-180 min. In two men given 8 micrograms/kg who were sampled for an additional 3 h, PRL levels peaked at 200-220 min and began to fall by 220-240 min, but had not returned to baseline by 6 h. There were no side-effects of PRL administration, although the 8 micrograms/kg dose caused transient local discomfort.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the possible functional significance of these nuclear binding sites. Upon addition to isolated ovarian (mostly luteal cells) nuclear membranes, hCG and hLH stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), an enzyme involved in nucleocytoplasmic transfer of mRNA, but not Mg2+-ATPase or NADH cytochrome c reductase activities, in a concentration-dependent manner. Heat-denatured hCG, isolated alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG, human FSH, PRL, and porcine relaxin had no effect on the enzyme. Addition of hCG antiserum blocked hCG's ability to stimulate NTPase activity. cAMP, which is a second messenger in hCG- and hLH-stimulated steroidogenesis, had no effect on NTPase activity. These results, which demonstrate that hCG acts on human ovarian nuclei directly, raise the possibility that internalized hCG might influence nuclear function(s) before it is eventually degraded in the lysosomes of ovarian cells.\r"

  ".W": "The urinary excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol was recently reported to be increased in patients with primary aldosteronism who have an adrenal adenoma and in those with glucocorticoid-suppressible aldosteronism. A direct RIA for 18-hydroxycortisol in urine and plasma has been described, and we here report our experience using a similar direct RIA and a more elaborate RIA which includes a preliminary high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification step. The urinary excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol was compared with that of other adrencorticoids. The urinary excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol in 37 normal subjects using the direct RIA was 112 +/- 49 (+/- SD) microgram/24 h, and that with the HPLC-RIA method was 63 +/- 36 micrograms/24 h. The accuracy and specificity of the HPLC-RIA assay method were confirmed by measuring the steroid after the HPLC step as the glycolic acid ester derivative. The urinary excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol correlated with that of cortisol (r = 0.36; P less than 0.01), 18-oxocortisol (r = 0.42; P less than 0.01), and 19-nordeoxycortisosterone (r = 0.71; P less than 0.001), but did not correlate with the excretion of aldosterone 18-oxoglucuronide (r = 0.25; P = 0.15942). Dexamethasone administration to five normal subjects significantly decreased 18-hydroxycortisol excretion from 81 +/- 47 to 23 +/- 8 micrograms/24 h. ACTH infusion in these subjects receiving dexamethasone significantly raised 18-hydroxycortisol excretion to 147 +/- 37 micrograms/24 h. Five days of a sodium-restricted diet (10 mmoles/day) resulted in a significant (P less than 0.02) increase in 18-hydroxycortisol excretion, but two of eight subjects had decreased excretion, although urinary aldosterone excretion increased, as expected. These studies demonstrate that the direct RIA significantly overestimates urinary 18-hydroxycortisol excretion. These studies also demonstrate that the major factor resulting 18-hydroxycortisol excretion is ACTH. However, since 18-hydroxycortisol excretion may increase during sodium depletion, angiotensin or other factors may also regulate its secretion.\r"

Forty-five critically ill patients suffering from hepatic coma (n = 10), terminal cancer (n = 9), stroke (n = 8), and respiratory insufficiency not treated (n = 7) and treated (n = 11) with dopamine were studied. The mortality rate was 80%. No patients received glucocorticoids, and only patients in the last group received dopamine. Serum total as well as free thyroid hormone index values were grossly reduced in the majority of the patients. The 34 patients not receiving dopamine in general had normal values of serum free T4 (32 of 34) and free T3 (31 of 34), measurable TSH (33 of 34), and detectable TSH responses to iv TRH (33 of 34). In contrast, the dopamine-treated patients had reduced serum free T4 and TSH levels compared to normal subjects (P less than 0.05), as well as reduced TSH responses to TRH (P less than 0.01). Serum free T4 and free T3 were below the normal range in 3 patients and 1 patient, respectively, and serum TSH was below the detection limit in 2 patients. We conclude that critically ill patients with nonthyroidal illness not receiving dopamine have normal pituitary-thyroid function, whereas dopamine induces some degree of secondary hypothyroidism.\r"

TSAb was measured by a sensitive cAMP accumulation assay using FRTL-5 cells, and TBII was determined by radioreceptor assay. In no patient with either recurrent or new onset postpartum hyperthyroidism did the serum free T3 index (FT3I) rise before the free T4 index (FT4I). Of the 10 patients who had postpartum thyrotoxicosis, concomitant increases in serum FT4I and FT3I, and TSAb and TBII were observed in only 1 patient. Increases in TSAb and TBII after those in FT4I and FT3I occurred in 6 patients. In 1 patient, an increase in TBII was associated with the occurrence of thyrotoxicosis, but TSAb increased 1 month later. In the other 2 patients, a TSAb increase was followed by the development of thyrotoxicosis, but TBII increased later. In 3 of these 10 patients, the increased serum FT4I and FT3I values decreased spontaneously, whereas the TSAb and TBII levels increased continuously. No positive test or increase in TSAb or TBII was found in the 5 patients with Graves' disease who did not have a postpartum relapse of thyrotoxicosis. These data indicate that postpartum initiation of Graves' thyrotoxicosis is not always associated with an increase in circulating anti-TSH receptor antibodies and that such parameters are poor indicators of thyroid function. Intrathyroidal humoral or cell-mediated immunological mechanisms may also be involved in mediating thyrotoxicosis in Graves' disease.\r"

The excised thyroid tissue had normal peroxidase activity in the tyrosine iodinase and guaiacol assays. [131I]Iodide, given 24 h before surgery, was distributed in thyroglobulin isolated in vitro as follows: monoiodotyrosine, 71.6%; diiodotyrosine, 26.7%; T3, 1.05%; and T4, 0.65%. The [131I]iodide content of the whole thyroid homogenate was 59%. The goiter content of thyroglobulin was 94.7 mg/g tissue. The thyroglobulin reacted normally with antihuman thyroglobulin antiserum. Fresh goiter slices and slices from five normal human thyroid specimens were incubated with 10(-6) M KI and [131I]iodide (tracer) containing medium alone (basal), medium plus 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase (GO), and medium plus 10(-4) M NADPH and 10(-5) M vitamin K3 (NA-K3). The percentages of organic iodine in the slices, measured as protein-bound 131I, were: basal: goiter, 0.8%; normal, 6.9 +/- 1.8% (+/- SE); GO: goiter, 15.1%; normal, 17.4 +/- 3.1%; and NA-K3: goiter, 16.7%; normal, 4.6 +/- 1.14%.

In the resting state, capillary red cell (rbc) flux exhibited greater intermittence compared with normal subjects, which increased with painful crisis. In crisis-free HbSS subjects, capillary occlusion and red cell sequestration occurred in only 8.2% of all capillaries and diminished to 5.8% during crisis, possibly due to sequestration of less deformable rbcs in other organs. Velocities of rbc's (Vrbc) were measured by video techniques under resting conditions and during postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) induced by a pressure cuff around the finger. Resting Vrbc was normal in crisis-free HbSS subjects, averaging 0.7 mm/s. In contrast, Vrbc was significantly elevated during crisis, to 0.98 mm/s, apparently due to compensatory arteriolar dilation. Crisis subjects exhibited a significantly depressed PORH with the ratio of peak red cell velocity to resting values reduced by 15% due to a loss of vasodilatory reserve, whereas crisis-free subjects exhibited a normal response. A 55% increase in the time to attain peak Vrbc was attributed to resistance increases, possibly resulting from red cell and leukocyte-to-endothelium adhesion during the induced ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium fluoride (20 mM) effected rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) in human neutrophils. Intracellular free Ca2+ levels increased after PIP2 hydrolysis but before respiratory burst activation. Both the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ levels and the extent of functional activation were dependent on the availability of extracellular Ca2+. The rate of F(-)-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis, however, was not affected when the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ was severely limited by depletion of extracellular Ca2+. Fluoride caused the specific hydrolysis of PIP2 in isolated neutrophil plasma membranes. This effect occurred in the presence of low levels of available Ca2+ and was accompanied by the release of inositol phosphates. We conclude that PIP2 hydrolysis is an early event in the response of neutrophils to F-. This response is not Ca2+-regulated but may lead to an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Activation of a PIP2-specific phospholipase independent of a change in cytosolic free Ca2+ levels may be the initial event in the stimulus-response pathway triggered by fluoride.\r"

Several individuals in her kindred with normal alpha-globin gene mapping studies (alpha alpha/alpha alpha) had mild alpha-thalassemia hematologic values consistent with the loss of one to two alpha-globin genes. These data suggested the presence of a nondeletion alpha-thalassemia defect in this family which segregates with the intact alpha alpha gene cluster. An abnormally migrating and highly unstable alpha-globin gene product was demonstrated by in vitro translation of the reticulocyte mRNA from the proposita and this mutant alpha-globin protein was mapped to the alpha 2-globin gene by hybrid-selected translation. The abnormal alpha 2-globin gene was cloned and sequenced. A single base mutation that results in a premature termination codon was identified at codon 116 (GAG----UAG). The defined alpha-globin genotype of the proposita (-alpha/alpha 116UAG alpha) and the positioning of this nonsense mutation at the alpha 2-globin gene locus are fully consistent with the observed alpha-thalassemia phenotype.\r"

To investigate the nature of the lesion underlying PNH cells, we examined the relationship of these abnormalities to one another. Analyses of DAF in acetylcholinesterase-negative erythrocytes revealed that these two abnormalities involve functionally independent molecules, coincide precisely in the same cell populations, and are similarly expressed in PNH II and more complement-sensitive PNH III erythrocytes. The DAF and acetylcholinesterase deficiencies contrast with the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) deficit, which is less profound and similarly distributed in complement-insensitive cell populations. Hemolytic studies showed that defective resistance to autologous C5b-9 attack is mediated by another mechanism. Whereas reconstitution of PNH II erythrocytes with DAF completely corrected their complement sensitivity, DAF reconstitution of PNH III erythrocytes restored their ability to circumvent C3b uptake but had no effect on their heightened susceptibility to reactive lysis. Assays of complement-insensitive (PNH I) erythrocytes surviving after reactive lysis disclosed partial DAF and acetylcholinesterase deficits. These findings indicate that the PNH lesion involves multiple membrane components and that PNH I erythrocytes are also abnormal.\r"

This cytokine inhibits adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase, which could decrease clearance of lipoproteins. Infections also increase hepatic lipogenesis. We now have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulates lipid synthesis in vivo. 2 h after administration of tumor necrosis factor (25 micrograms/200 g), plasma triglycerides increase 2.2-fold and remain elevated for 17 h. Plasma cholesterol also increases, but this effect appears after 7 h. Tumor necrosis factor rapidly stimulates incorporation of tritiated water into fatty acids in the liver (1-2 h), which persists for 17 h. Also, tumor necrosis factor stimulates hepatic sterol synthesis. Of note, tumor necrosis factor treatment does not stimulate lipid synthesis in other tissues, including adipose tissue. Labeled fatty acids rapidly increase in the plasma, raising the possibility that stimulation of hepatic lipogenesis by tumor necrosis factor contributes to the hyperlipidemia of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Two variant spectrins have been described in hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). Both are characterized by increased susceptibility of the alpha I (N-terminal) 80-kD domain to mild tryptic digestion, yielding peptides of 46-50 or 65-68 kD (T50a and T68 in our terminology). In this report we add a third unstable spectrin alpha I domain found in three kindreds with HE; alpha IT80 in this type of spectrin is cleaved by mild tryptic digestion to a 50-kD peptide (T50b) distinguished from T50a by its more basic isoelectric point. All three spectrins show impaired self-association to form oligomers. Intermediate tryptic peptides of the three unstable alpha I domains from HE spectrins were characterized by monoclonal immunoblotting and I125 limit peptide mapping and affinity purified using polyclonal anti-alpha IT80. Partial amino acid sequences of alpha I domain peptides were obtained from two unrelated patients for each of the three variant spectrins. T50a results from cleavage at arginine 250 or lysine 252 of alpha IT80; a proline replaced the normal leucine or serine at residues 254 and 255, respectively. T50b and a 19-kD peptide result from cleavage at arginine 462 or arginine 464; a proline replaced the normal residue 465 (in T19b) in one of the two patients studied. T68 results from cleavage at arginine 131. In both 68-kD peptides examined, a leucine is inserted at residue 150. The relationship of the sequence changes to the new tryptic cleavages, to the current model of alpha I domain structure, and to defective spectrin self-association is discussed.\r"

To examine the mechanism of this HCO3- reabsorption profile, intracellular pH (pHi) was measured along the superficial PT of the rat under free-flow and stationary microperfusion using the pH-sensitive fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU). With 4MU superfusion, pHi was found to decline along the PT. Observation with 365-nm excitation revealed that EPS were brightly fluorescent and always emerged away from their star vessel. Midproximal segments were darker and closer to the star vessel which was surrounded by the darkest LPS. Decreasing luminal HCO3- from 15 to 0 mM lowered pHi in both EPS and LPS, but pHi remained more alkaline in EPS with both perfusates. Thus the axial decline in pHi along the PT is due to both luminal factors and intrinsic differences in luminal H+ extrusion in PT cells.\r"

In contrast, TBCa and forearm integral (cortical and trabecular) and cortical bone were unrelated to age, although the time since menopause also had some influence. Forearm integral and cortical bone measurements were quite well correlated with TBCa (r = 0.84 and 0.73, respectively, P less than 0.001). The correlation between spinal bone measurements and any of the forearm measurements, even purely trabecular bone, was weak (r less than 0.52, P less than 0.001). Our results show quite clearly that forearm bone measurements cannot be used to predict bone density in the vertebrae. Loss of ovarian function affects bone in general, and trabecular bone in particular. Bone measurements at specific anatomical sites are clearly necessary for studies of metabolic bone diseases and their response to treatment.\r"

In vivo microperfusion was used in both the early and late PCT in Munich-Wistar rats. Systemic angiotensin II administration (20 ng/kg X min) or inhibition of endogenous angiotensin II activity with saralasin (1 microgram/kg X min) caused profound changes in bicarbonate absorption in the early PCT (169 +/- 25 and -187 +/- 15 peq/mm X min, respectively). Because the bicarbonate absorptive capacity of the early PCT under free-flow conditions is 500 peq/mm X min, angiotensin II administration or inhibition affected greater than 60% of proton secretion in this segment. Both agents less markedly affected bicarbonate absorption in the late PCT (+/- 28 peq/mm X min) or chloride absorption (+/- 68-99 peq/mm X min) in both the early and late PCT. Because of its potential for controlling the majority of bicarbonate absorption in the early PCT (hence greater than or equal to 30% of bicarbonate absorption in the entire nephron), angiotensin II may be a powerful physiologic regulator of renal acidification.\r"

Autologous 111In-labeled platelet localization studies were performed to assess platelet clearance. Although there was no increase in the frequency of marrow CFU-Meg, a specific increase in the CFU-Meg [3H]TdR suicide rate was seen which was inversely correlated with the platelet count (P less than 0.001). Platelet turnover studies showed significant numbers of patients had inappropriate thrombopoietic responses to their reduced platelet counts. Platelet-associated antibody levels correlated inversely with platelet turnover suggesting that antiplatelet antibody impairs platelet production. The circulating platelet count was best predicted by an index relating platelet production (i.e., turnover) to the spleen-liver platelet clearance that correlated directly with platelet survival (P less than 0.001). In summary, both depressed platelet production and increased platelet clearance by the liver and spleen contribute to the thrombocytopenia of AITP.\r"

Incubation of hepatocytes from ethanol-fed rats for 4 h in modified Fisher's medium revealed a greater absolute and fractional GSH efflux rate than controls with maintenance of constant cellular GSH, indicating increased net GSH synthesis. Inhibition of gamma-glutamyltransferase had no effect on these results, which indicates that no degradation of GSH had occurred during these studies. Enhanced fractional efflux was also noted in the perfused livers from ethanol-fed rats. Incubation of hepatocytes in medium containing up to 50 mM ethanol had no effect on cellular GSH, accumulation of GSH in the medium, or cell viability. Thus, chronic ethanol feeding causes a modest fall in cytosolic and a marked fall in mitochondrial GSH. Fractional GSH efflux and therefore synthesis are increased under basal conditions by chronic ethanol feeding, whereas the cellular concentration of GSH drops to a lower steady state level. Incubation of hepatocytes with ethanol indicates that it has no direct, acute effect on hepatic GSH homeostasis.\r"

In erythrocytes from patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), the species restriction is lost: PNH-erythrocytes (PNH-E) are susceptible to lysis by human complement. In human erythrocytes (huE) the species restriction is ascribed to an integral membrane protein, designated C8-binding protein (C8bp). In the present study, we tested membranes of PNH-E type III for the presence of C8bp. A protein with C8-binding capacity could not be detected. C8bp, which was isolated from the membrane of huE, inhibited the lysis of PNH-E by C5b-9 as well as the C9 polymerization. Thus, addition of C8bp restored the species restriction in PNH-E. In conclusion, we propose that lack of C8bp might represent the defect in PNH-E type III membranes, which is responsible for their enhanced lytic susceptibility towards lysis by the late complement components.\r"

Compared with cells grown without triiodothyronine (T3), cells grown in 10 nM T3 possessed 67% (P less than 0.05) more dihydropyridine 3H-PN200-110 binding sites, 24% (P less than 0.05) more beta-adrenergic antagonist 3H-CGP12177 binding sites, a 57% (P less than 0.05) greater nifedipine-sensitive initial 45Ca uptake rate, and a 31% (P less than 0.05) greater nifedipine-sensitive 45Ca uptake rate in response to BAY k 8644. Time-averaged mean intracellular free Ca concentration ([Ca]i) measured with fura-2, total protein content, and dissociation constant values for 3H-PN200-110 or 3H-CGP12177 binding was not significantly different in the two groups of cells. BAY k 8644 (1 microM) increased mean [Ca]i 2.85- or 2.16-fold in cells grown with or without 10 nM T3, respectively. l-Isoproterenol (1 microM) increased [Ca]i 1.53- or 1.28-fold in cells grown with or without 10 nM T3, respectively. We conclude that thyroid hormone augments transsarcolemmal Ca influx, at least in part via slow Ca channels associated with increased numbers of these channels. T3-treated cells appear to be more responsive to the effects of BAY k 8644 or isoproterenol on [Ca]i.\r"

In the second and third patients the tumors were located on the forehead and were removed with a wide excision. In the second patient the tumor metastasized to regional lymph nodes 1 month after treatment. Light microscopic examination in all patients showed an undifferentiated, small cell, dermal tumor with prominent epidermotropism, forming Pautrier-like microabscesses. Immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase was positive, and ultrastructural examination revealed numerous cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate-sized filaments. The literature concerning epidermal involvement by primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin is reviewed; the relation with basal cell carcinoma and treatment are discussed.\r"

The chemotactic activity of both monocytes and neutrophils was normalized after 4 weeks of anthralin therapy and after 6 weeks of PUVA treatment. The chemotaxis-enhancing properties of plasma from psoriasis patients returned to normal values already after 2 weeks of treatment.\r"

In four patients a malignancy had been identified at the time of the initial examination, and four other patients developed malignancies during the follow-up period. Seven of the patients died of the malignancy during the follow-up period. This incidence of malignancies does not differ significantly from the value expected in a general population, matched for age and sex. However, two of the cancers were lymphomas, and this incidence is significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that expected in a similarly matched population. As a whole our study indicates that no significant overall increase of malignant neoplasms is to be expected in patients with generalized pruritus and, therefore, any general efforts for cancer follow-up screening seem unwarranted in patients with pruritus.\r"

In this study the pathologic processes of lipoid proteinosis were evaluated by ultrastructural and biochemical analysis of skin and cultured fibroblasts from a patient with classic features of the disease. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of hyalinlike material with a granular appearance interspersed between collagen fibers. Immediately surrounding the blood vessel walls, there was reduplication of basal laminae in an \"onionskin\" arrangement. The fibroblastic cells in the affected dermis contained peculiar cytoplasmic inclusions. Biochemical studies with the cultured fibroblasts showed that the total synthesis of extracellular matrix components, as detected by the synthesis of radioactive hydroxyproline or the incorporation of 35SO4(2-) and [3H]glucosamine into macromolecules, was not altered in lipoid proteinosis. However, the relative expression of type I and type III procollagen genes, as detected by molecular hybridizations with pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 1(III) procollagen complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes, was markedly altered in cultured fibroblasts. Specifically, the type I procollagen messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were significantly reduced, resulting in a decreased type I/III procollagen mRNA ratio. Furthermore, the replicative capacity of lipoid proteinosis fibroblasts, as detected by the incorporation of radioactive thymidine, was reduced. Thus the skin fibroblasts from lipoid proteinosis demonstrate ultrastructural changes, as well as alterations in their phenotypic characteristics, and these changes may have relevance to the pathologic processes of this systemic disease affecting the skin and other organs.\r"

Especially, the relevance of positive patch test reactions to local anesthetics with regard to the compatibility of injected local anesthetics is unclear. We therefore subjected 104 patch test-positive probands to prick and intradermal tests with seven local anesthetic agents. All prick tests were negative. Only 14 patients showed positive reactions in intradermal tests: 11 with the ester local anesthetic procaine, one with the amide local anesthetic butanilicaine, and two with both. Procaine yielded both immediate and delayed reactions; butanilicaine, only immediate reactions. All other local anesthetics showed negative reactions. It is concluded that in patients with positive patch test reactions to local anesthetics and negative history of anaphylactoid reactions, positive skin test reactions to intradermal application are rare and that, therefore, the risk of anaphylactic reactions to injection anesthesia with amide local anesthetics, except butanilicaine, appears low in these patients.\r"

When compared to skin biopsy specimens from non-AIDS patients with drug eruptions, specimens from patients with AIDS and interface dermatitis demonstrated a greater degree of vacuolar change, the frequent occurrence of necrotic keratinocytes, often in clumps, and the absence of eosinophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the dermal infiltrates. Histologic and clinical features of our patients with AIDS and interface dermatitis are presented and contrasted with other interface dermatitides. Systemic and cutaneous immune abnormalities in patients with AIDS may be relevant to the pathogenesis of this interface process.\r"

With its roots in Mohs' surgery, its chief characteristic is that it provides microscopic confirmation of complete removal. The procedure appears to have certain indications and definite limitations. An effort has been made to define these. In general, curettage and shave excision will be most useful as a substitute for curettage and electrodesiccation in locations and for skin cancers for which the curettage and electrodesiccation procedure is being considered but is not quite adequate. Nineteen cases are presented. They fall into two groups, according to the timing of the procedure. Although the technic is not difficult, it is more time consuming than curettage and electrodesiccation, and it requires much more attention to detail. The interpretation of horizontal sections presents certain pitfalls that must be recognized.\r"

This method relies on thin-layer excision, orienting, mapping, and microscopic examination of tissue specimens, followed by reexcision of outlying extensions of tumor until a tumor-free plane is reached. Accurate and precise orienting and mapping of tissue are critical in order to attain high cure rates. The orienting, mapping, and reexcision of tissue of large or complicated tumors can be more rapidly and accurately accomplished by using metal staples.\r"

To help patient compliance and therapeutic response, and to avoid pitfalls, extensive step-by-step predermabrasion evaluation and patient selection procedures are helpful. Standard checklists, operative techniques, and patient follow-up procedures have improved the results. Currently, the optimal dermabrasion procedure consists not only of an extensive facial planing, but the use of Loo punch or scalpel excision and the suturing of large cysts and scars during the procedure and the filling of valley-like depressions with liquid collagen or silicone after the procedure. These methods of extensive standard procedures and protocols, rigid patient selection, and pre-, during, and postdermabrasion follow-ups are presented so medical staffs can avoid common pitfalls.\r"

  ".W": "Silent myocardial ischemia is common in unstable angina, but its prognostic significance is unknown. Fifty-two (42 with subsequent angiography) of 81 patients prospectively evaluated for unstable angina had ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings analyzed by compact analog technique after they had received medical treatment (3 of the 52 had unanalyzable recordings and were excluded). From 1,103 hours of recordings, 298 ischemic episodes were identified, only 9% associated with angina. By Ridit analysis a significant correlation was found between the cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia and the number of diseased coronary vessels and indexes of proximal stenosis. During a 3 to 6 month follow-up period, there was one death and one patient was lost to follow-up among 20 patients without transient ischemia; in the group of 11 patients with a cumulative duration of transient ischemia less than 60 minutes/24 h, 7 were alive and well, 2 required coronary bypass surgery, 1 had coronary angioplasty for recurrence of angina and 1 was lost to follow-up. In the group of 18 patients with ischemia duration greater than 60 minutes/24 h, only 1 developed a stable angina pattern; 12 required coronary surgery (n = 11) or angioplasty (n = 1) and 5 developed myocardial infarction (2 died, 2 needed surgery for postinfarction angina and 1 recovered). A favorable clinical outcome occurred in only 6% of patients in the group with ischemia duration greater than 60 minutes/24 h; this rate was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than that (70%) for the group with ischemia duration less than 60 minutes/24 h or that (95%) for the group without ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite the generally excellent success with balloon dilation for the stenotic lesions of congenital and acquired heart disease, technical difficulties sometimes prevent satisfactory results. Such technical difficulties include: a large diameter of the anulus of the stenotic lesion relative to available balloon diameter, difficulty in the insertion or removal of the larger balloon catheters, and permanent damage to or obstruction of the femoral vessels by the redundant deflated balloon material of the large balloons. A double balloon technique was initiated to resolve these difficulties. With this method, percutaneous balloon angioplasty catheters were inserted in right and left femoral vessels, placed side by side across the stenotic lesion and inflated simultaneously. Dilation procedures using the two balloon technique were performed in 41 patients: 18 with pulmonary valve stenosis, 14 with aortic valve stenosis, 5 with mitral valve stenosis, 3 with vena caval obstruction following the Mustard or Senning procedure and 1 with tricuspid valve stenosis. Patient ages ranged from 1 to 75 years (mean 17.8) and patient weights ranged from 8.9 to 89 kg (mean 42.3). Balloon catheter sizes ranged from 10 to 20 mm in diameter. Average maximal pressure gradient in mm Hg before dilation was 61 in pulmonary stenosis, 68 in aortic stenosis, 21 in mitral stenosis, 12 in tricuspid stenosis and 25 in vena caval stenosis. Average maximal valvular pressure gradient after dilation was 13 in pulmonary stenosis, 24 in aortic stenosis, 4 in mitral stenosis, 0 in tricuspid stenosis, and 1 in vena caval stenosis. No major complications were encountered with the procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Echocardiographic studies, adequate for analysis of aortic valve area using the continuity equation, were obtained in 31 patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years who were undergoing catheterization for assessment of suspected aortic stenosis. Catheterization-determined aortic valve area was 0.74 +/- 0.30 cm2 (mean +/- SD) and Doppler-determined aortic valve areas were 0.68 +/- 0.27 and 0.65 +/- 0.27 cm2, depending on whether peak or mean velocities, respectively, were entered into the continuity equation. There were significant correlations between both of the Doppler-derived and the catheterization-determined aortic valve areas (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001 for both the continuity equation employing peak velocities and the continuity equation employing mean velocities) which were demonstrated to be linear by F test (catheterization area = -0.03 + 1.13 X Doppler area determined using peak velocities, SEE = 0.163 cm2, p less than 0.001; and catheterization area = -0.02 + 1.16 X Doppler area determined using mean velocities, SEE = 0.165 cm2, p less than 0.001). Both sets of correlations had linear regression parameters meeting the conditions for identity. Significant linear correlations were also noted between the non-invasive measurements of aortic valve excursion, ventricular ejection time, time to one-half carotid upstroke, maximal Doppler velocity and maximal Doppler gradient and catheterization aortic valve area, but the correlations were less tight than those between valve areas determined by catheterization and by Doppler continuity equation. Ten of the patients underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty. There were significant linear correlations between aortic valve areas determined by Doppler and catheterization methods both before valvuloplasty (r = 0.77, p = 0.01; p less than 0.001 by F test, SEE = 0.134 cm2) and after valvuloplasty (r = 0.85, p less than 0.01; p = 0.0001 by F test, SEE = 0.161 cm2). Linear regression parameters met the conditions for identity. There was also a significant linear correlation between catheterization and Doppler measurements of absolute change in aortic valve area (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01; p less than 0.001 by F test, SEE = 0.11 cm2). Aortic valve area can be determined reliably by continuity equation in elderly patients. In addition, results of balloon valvuloplasty, measured by changes in catheterization-determined aortic valve area, are accurately reflected by changes in aortic valve area determined using the continuity equation.\r"

Segmental thallium initial uptake, linear clearance, monoexponential clearance and redistribution were measured from early, intermediate and delayed images acquired in three projections. Normal values were determined from 13 other clinically normal subjects. When five segments per view were used for quantitative analysis, sensitivity and specificity were 87 and 63%, respectively, for uptake, 77 and 67% for linear clearance, 60 and 60% for monoexponential clearance and 62 and 56% for redistribution. Of the four variables, uptake and linear clearance were the most sensitive (p less than 0.01) and specificity did not differ significantly. Using three segments per view, the specificity of uptake increased (p less than 0.05) to 78% without a significant change in sensitivity (85%). With this approach, sensitivity and specificity did not differ from those of qualitative analysis (85 and 78%, respectively). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the best quantitative thallium correlate of the presence of coronary artery disease was a combination variable of \"either abnormal uptake or abnormal linear clearance, or both.\" Using five segments per view, the model's specificity (85%) was greater than that of uptake alone (p less than 0.02), with similar sensitivity (92%). Using three segments per view, the model's specificity (93%) was greater than that of uptake alone (p less than 0.05) and of qualitative analysis (p less than 0.05), with similar sensitivity (85%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infarction was produced by injecting latex into the right coronary artery and ECG consequences were examined by body surface isopotential mapping methods using an 84 electrode torso array. During sinus rhythm, subtraction of preinfarction from postinfarction maps demonstrated that right ventricular necrosis produced abnormal negative potentials over the right hemithorax during the early, middle and late portions of the QRS complex. These patterns corresponded to loss of R waves and deepening of preexistent or development of new Q and S waves in waveforms from this region. Patterns during ectopic ventricular stimulation were compared with mean maps derived from 13 control dogs. Both left and right ventricular pacing after right ventricular infarction resulted in a right-sided abnormal minimum, similar in location to that observed during sinus rhythm, throughout the QRS complex. Thus, right ventricular necrosis does produce QRS complex changes over the right torso that are analogous to those produced by left ventricular infarction, and the dominant pattern of an abnormal right-sided minimum was present regardless of the ventricular activation pattern. This latter finding suggests that the region of right ventricular necrosis provided a supplementary path for current to reenter the heart regardless of the current source, so that an overlying electrode would record negative voltage with all activation patterns.\r"

Cardiac output decreased significantly at each level of cardiac tamponade; the changes in cardiac output and mean aortic pressure were comparable with atrial and ventricular tamponade. Combined atrial and ventricular tamponade produced significantly greater increases of right and left atrial pressure and significantly greater decreases of cardiac output than did either atrial or ventricular tamponade. During atrial tamponade only, a significant pressure gradient developed between the venae cavae and the right atrium. Compression of both ventricles by tamponade has a much greater hemodynamic effect than does compression of either ventricle alone. Compression of the entire heart has a greater hemodynamic effect than does compression of the atria alone or the ventricles alone. Compression of the great veins has a potential effect in tamponade, demonstrable when the ventricles could fill normally.\r"

A simultaneous 12 lead electrocardiogram was recorded before passing the balloon catheter and again at 30 seconds into the fourth inflation cycle. Using a second arterial catheter, a left ventriculogram was obtained at 40 seconds into the fourth inflation cycle. The extent of wall motion abnormalities was described as the percent of left ventricular perimeter showing hypocontractility. During balloon inflation, 19 of the 23 patients developed new hypocontractility ranging from 3 to 40%. ST segment elevation in lead V2 was the most sensitive marker for anterior wall hypocontractility and ST segment elevation in lead III was the most sensitive marker for inferior wall hypocontractility. Highly significant correlations were observed between the extent of the hypocontractile perimeter and 1) the sum of ST segment elevation in all 12 leads; 2) the magnitude of ST segment elevation in either lead V2 or lead III; and 3) the total number of leads with ST elevation greater than or equal to 0.5 mV. No significant changes were seen in the sum of R wave amplitudes, but a significant prolongation of the QT interval was seen during ischemia. In conclusion, acute ST segment elevation parallels the development of new asynergy during transluminal coronary angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Being a three-dimensional technique, NMR imaging has the capability of measuring volumes without the need for assumptions regarding ventricular geometry. In this study, the technique was validated in 19 excised dog hearts, filled with silicone-rubber, imaged using a multislice spin-echo sequence. The volume of the cavity in each slice was calculated from the number of pixels outlined for each slice multiplied by the pixel volume. Ventricular volumes measured by NMR imaging were highly correlated with cast volumes measured by water displacement: right ventricle (RV):RVNMR = 1.05 RVcast - 1.62; r = 0.99, SEE = 0.96 ml; left ventricle (LV):LVNMR = 0.98 LVcast + 0.35, r = 0.98, SEE = 1.48 ml. After validation in casts, NMR imaging volumes were measured in eight living dogs using a multiphasic gated technique to obtain images at 5, 105, 205, 305 and 405 ms after the QRS complex. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) measured by NMR imaging were significantly correlated with thermodilution (TD) measurements (CONMR = 0.63 COTD + 0.51 liters/min; r = 0.78, SEE = 0.57 liters/min; SVNMR = 0.67 SVTD + 1.95 ml; SEE = 5.58 ml). Right and left stroke volumes were closely related (LVSVNMR = 0.9 RVSVNMR + 1.75; r = 0.94, SEE = 4.32 ml), with the slope and intercept of the regression line showing no difference from 1 and 0, respectively. However, volumes determined by NMR imaging underestimated the thermodilution measurements, presumably reflecting the inability to obtain a true systolic image with the present sampling rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right endomyocardial biopsy was performed at the time of cardiac catheterization. Five hemodynamic indexes were used for functional assessment: ejection fraction, ratio of end-systolic stress to volume index, end-diastolic stress, time constant (T) of left ventricular pressure fall, and end-systolic stress. Six histologic findings (disarray of myofibers, hypertrophy of myofibers, scarcity of myofibrils, nuclear changes of myofibers, vacuolization of myofibers and proliferation of collagen fibers) were graded from (-) to (4+). Each finding was assigned to category (-) or (+) according to the absence or presence of significant abnormality. Ordinary statistical analysis revealed that, although ejection fraction was lower in category (+) for proliferation of collagen fibers, ratio of end-systolic to volume index was reduced for category (+) of hypertrophy of myofibers. A significant correlation was present between hypertrophy of myofibers and proliferation of collagen fibers by Spearman rank correlation. When principal component analysis was applied to the hemodynamic data, two principal components could be extracted. Fisher's discriminant analysis could clearly differentiate two categories (-) and (+) in the semiquantitative histologic finding of proliferation of collagen fibers. The analysis indicated that contractility was reduced with elevated afterload in that category (+). Thus, proliferation of collagen fibers may play a pivotal role in deteriorating contractility in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "In a 1 year period, 56 neonates with a clinical diagnosis of ductus arteriosus had Doppler echocardiographic confirmation of the ductus; 33 (59%) had additional, turbulent left to right flow at the atrial level through a valve-incompetent foramen ovale. Normalized left atrial dimensions in the group with the atrial shunt were significantly larger than when there was a competent foramen ovale; when the ductus closed and left atrial enlargement receded, the atrial shunt disappeared. However, several infants with large left chambers had no interatrial shunting. When the atrial shunt was present, there were up to three flow pulses, corresponding to atrial systole, ventricular systole and ventricular diastole, but these were frequently fused into two pulses or even one pulse per cycle. The atrial septal morphology provided supporting clues: general bowing of the septum or a localized bulge in the region of the foramen ovale indicated relatively high left atrial pressure, and frequently a slitlike dropout could be seen at the superior edge of the foramen. During the study, three additional neonates with a ductus arteriosus were found to have a secundum atrial septal defect with a typical echographic image, \"matchhead\" appearance of the septal rim of the defect, but the Doppler flow patterns were indistinguishable from those of a valve-incompetent foramen ovale. The hemodynamic effects of the interatrial shunt, from either cause, seemed slight during the hospital course, but the presence of a valve-incompetent foramen ovale indicated a relatively large ductal shunt. Quantification of the ductal shunt, however, continues to rely primarily on measurement of the left atrial and ventricular size.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac rhythm has been evaluated using 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings in 92 survivors of anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries. A low incidence of arrhythmias was found in preoperative recordings made in 41 patients. Thirty-four (83%) patients showed sinus rhythm exclusively; one (2.4%) patient had supraventricular premature beats and one (2.4%) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Six patients (14.6%) had ventricular arrhythmias, five (12.2%) with modified Lown grade 1 ventricular premature beats and one (2.4%) with a modified Lown grade 5 arrhythmia. The incidence of arrhythmias was unchanged after a first stage operation consisting of banding of the pulmonary artery with or without insertion of a systemic to pulmonary shunt. During a mean 3.1 year follow-up, there have been no cases of arrhythmic death or symptomatic arrhythmias requiring treatment. Postoperative recordings in 40 patients have shown a low incidence of important arrhythmias with 62% having recordings free from arrhythmias. There was an increase in the incidence of infrequent supraventricular premature beats from 4.9% preoperatively to 23% postoperatively (p less than 0.05), with no significant change in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. One patient has acquired complete heart block but all others had sinus rhythm postoperatively. Preoperative arrhythmias are uncommon in patients with transposition of the great arteries and are similar to those described in normal children. The incidence of important arrhythmias after anatomic correction is low during the medium-term period of follow-up. Further longitudinal studies will be required to determine whether this promising result is maintained.\r"

  ".U": "87251770\r", 
  ".W": "Sotalol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that prolongs the duration of the cardiac action potential in humans, without affecting the upstroke velocity of depolarization. The dextrorotatory isomer, d-sotalol, retains these class III effects, but has little beta-blocking activity in vitro. d-Sotalol has not been studied extensively in humans. The electrocardiographic (ECG) and electrophysiologic effects of d- and d,l-sotalol were therefore assessed in a prospective randomized study of 20 patients. Each patient received either d-sotalol (1, 1.5 or 2 mg/kg body weight) or d,l-sotalol (1 mg/kg) by intravenous infusion. The QT and QTc intervals were prolonged and refractoriness increased in the atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node, His-Purkinje system and right ventricle after both d- and d,l-sotalol. After d-sotalol, the increases in both QT and QTc intervals and in atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were dose dependent. Highly significant linear correlation was demonstrated between the plasma sotalol level and the change in QT (r = 0.86, p = 0.001) and QTc intervals (r = 0.79, p = 0.002), and between the plasma sotalol level and the effective refractory period of the right atrium (r = 0.75, p = 0.005) and ventricle (r = 0.70, p = 0.025). This study confirms that d-sotalol has effects consistent with class III properties. It demonstrates these effects in humans, and suggests that d-sotalol may prove to be a useful antiarrhythmic agent.\r"

This study examined the relative value of the three tests, when obtained a mean of 7 days after acute myocardial infarction, in predicting 1 year mortality in 93 patients. Planar thallium-201 images were obtained in three projections and were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 in 15 segments (normal score = 60). Patients were classified as having high risk test results as follows: thallium score less than or equal to 45 (33 patients), left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (51 patients) and complex ventricular arrhythmias on Holter monitoring (36 patients). During the follow-up of 6.4 +/- 3.4 months (mean +/- SD), 15 patients died of cardiac causes. All three tests were important predictors of survival by univariate Cox survival analysis; the thallium score, however, was the only important predictor by multivariate analysis. The predictive power of the thallium score was comparable with that of combined ejection fraction and Holter monitoring (chi-square = 21 versus chi-square = 22). Thus, rest thallium-201 imaging performed before hospital discharge provides important prognostic information in survivors of acute myocardial infarction which is comparable with that provided by left ventricular ejection fraction and Holter monitoring. Patients with a lower thallium score (large perfusion defects) are at high risk of cardiac death during the first year after infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The exercise response of the ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume was studied in 243 patients with chest pain and coronary artery disease who underwent supine rest and exercise equilibrium radionuclide angiography. There was a wide variation in both rest and exercise variables in this group. The exercise response of the systolic pressure/volume ratio also varied greatly, ranging from a decrease of 59% to an increase of 136%. Twenty-one clinical, catheterization and radionuclide angiographic variables were examined to determine their relation to the exercise response of the systolic pressure/volume ratio; nine variables were individually correlated with this ratio. Multiple regression analysis identified the change in end-diastolic volume index with exercise, rest systolic blood pressure, coronary artery Gensini score and peak work load as significant independent predictors of the exercise response of the systolic pressure/volume ratio; the latter correlated significantly with the change in ejection fraction with exercise (r = 0.73, p less than 0.0001). Its sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery disease in the study group (84%) and its \"normalcy rate\" in a group of 120 patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease (81%) were similar to those of the peak exercise ejection fraction (75 and 82%, respectively). These results demonstrate that the exercise response of the systolic pressure/end-systolic volume ratio is a complex response that is influenced by several pathophysiologic variables in the presence of coronary artery disease. It does not offer any advantage over ejection fraction measurements for the detection of exercise-induced ischemia.\r"

Fibrin formation was assessed from plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A. Platelet activation was assessed by levels of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2. Plasma levels were measured before, during and after acute myocardial ischemia induced by rapid atrial pacing. Blood samples were collected from the ascending aorta and from the great cardiac vein through heparin-bonded catheters. The occurrence of anterior myocardial ischemia was established by electrocardiography and by myocardial lactate extraction. No significant transmyocardial gradients in the levels of fibrinopeptide A, platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin or thromboxane B2 were found at rest, during ischemia or in the recovery period, and levels in the great cardiac vein did not change in response to ischemia. These data indicate that pacing-induced myocardial ischemia does not result in release of fibrinopeptide A, platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin or thromboxane B2 into the coronary circulation, and imply that acute ischemia does not induce platelet activation or fibrin formation in the coronary circulation.\r"

Marked sinus slowing (71 versus 12 versus 4%, respectively, p less than 0.00001), hypotension (68 versus 0 versus 0%, p less than 0.00001), supraventricular arrhythmias (19 versus 6 versus 0%, p = 0.05) and primary cardiac arrest (16 versus 0 versus 0%, p less than 0.05) were significantly more frequent in the severe cervical injury group. The frequency of bradyarrhythmias peaked on day 4 after injury and gradually declined thereafter. All observed abnormalities resolved spontaneously within 2 to 6 weeks. The primary mechanism underlying these observations appears to involve the acute autonomic imbalance created by the disruption of sympathetic pathways located in the cervical cord. Acute severe injury to the cervical spinal cord is regularly accompanied by arrhythmias and hemodynamic abnormalities not found with thoracolumbar cord trauma. These abnormalities are limited to the first 14 days after injury, a period in which life-threatening disturbances must be anticipated.\r"

The 23 patients with basal obstruction (average left ventricular outflow gradient, 77 +/- 33 mm Hg; left ventricular systolic pressure, 196 +/- 33 mm Hg, mean +/- 1 SD) had significantly lower coronary resistance (0.85 +/- 0.18 versus 1.32 +/- 0.44 mm Hg X min/ml, p less than 0.001) and higher basal coronary flow (106 +/- 20 versus 80 +/- 25 ml/min, p less than 0.001) in the anterior left ventricle, associated with higher regional myocardial oxygen consumption (12.4 +/- 3.6 versus 8.9 +/- 3.3 ml oxygen/min, p less than 0.001) compared with the 27 patients without obstruction (mean left ventricular systolic pressure 134 +/- 18 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow were also significantly higher at paced heart rates of 100 and 130 beats/min (the anginal threshold for 41 of the 50 patients) in patients with obstruction compared with those without. In patients with obstruction, transmural coronary flow reserve was exhausted at a heart rate of 130 beats/min; higher heart rates resulted in more severe metabolic evidence of ischemia with all patients experiencing chest pain, associated with an actual increase in coronary resistance. Patients without obstruction also demonstrated evidence of ischemia at heart rates of 130 and 150 beats/min, with 25 of 27 patients experiencing chest pain. In this group, myocardial ischemia occurred at significantly lower coronary flow, higher coronary resistance and lower myocardial oxygen consumption, suggesting more severely impaired flow delivery in this group compared with those with obstruction. Abnormalities in myocardial oxygen extraction and marked elevation in filling pressures during stress were noted in both groups. Thus, obstruction to left ventricular outflow is associated with high left ventricular systolic pressure and oxygen consumption and therefore has important pathogenetic importance to the precipitation of ischemia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients without obstruction may have greater impairment in coronary flow delivery during stress.\r"

However, whether patients with chronic coronary artery disease and bundle branch block have a predominance of left anterior descending artery lesions is not known. Similarly, the prognostic implications of bundle branch block have been studied primarily in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, and the independent prognostic implications of bundle branch block in patients with chronic coronary artery disease are not known. The electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 15,609 patients with chronic coronary artery disease who underwent coronary and left ventricular angiography as part of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) were reviewed, and 522 patients with bundle branch block were identified. Patients with bundle branch block had both more extensive coronary artery disease and worse left ventricular function than did patients without bundle branch block. However, no particular location of coronary artery stenosis or left ventricular wall motion abnormality predominated in patients with bundle branch block. During a follow-up period of 4.9 +/- 1.3 years, 2,386 patients died. Actuarial probability of mortality at 2 years in patients with left bundle branch block was more than five times that in patients without bundle branch block (p less than 0.0001), and in patients with right bundle branch block the mortality rate was approximately twice that in patients without bundle branch block (p less than 0.0001). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that left bundle branch block, but not right bundle branch block, was a strong predictor of mortality, independent of degree of heart failure, extent of coronary disease and other variables (p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many drug regimens, however, affect the tachycardia but fail to prevent its initiation. In this study, 258 patients who underwent serial electrophysiologic studies were followed up. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the results of electrophysiologic testing. Group 1 included patients in whom the initiation of ventricular tachycardia was prevented by the drug regimen. In groups 2 and 3 the ventricular tachycardia was still inducible with the discharge drug regimen. In group 2, the drug regimen demonstrated a beneficial response (that is, the tachycardia cycle length increased by greater than 100 ms and the tachycardia did not produce severe symptoms). In group 3, the regimen did not produce a beneficial response. During follow-up, recurrence of sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred in 7 (7%) of 103 group 1 patients but in 20 (39%) of 51 and 52 (50%) of 104 group 2 and 3 patients, respectively. However, the total mortality and sudden death mortality rates were substantially reduced in group 2 (12 and 4%, respectively) compared with group 3 (39 and 34%).

Thus, under certain circumstances, a drug regimen that produces a beneficial response may be an acceptable clinical alternative, particularly when no regimen prevents induction of ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Electrophysiologic study was performed in all patients a mean of 14 days after beginning amiodarone therapy. Forty-six patients who were given oral amiodarone therapy experienced arrhythmia recurrence. Multivariate analysis was performed using 16 clinical and electrophysiologic variables to determine which factors were associated with 1) arrhythmia recurrence and 2) a poorly tolerated arrhythmia recurrence (that is, cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death) during oral amiodarone therapy. No variable predicted arrhythmia recurrence. Five variables correlated significantly with a poorly tolerated arrhythmia recurrence. Hemodynamic stability of the arrhythmia induced on electrophysiologic testing during amiodarone therapy had the best predictive value (p less than 0.001). Younger age, lower ejection fraction, a poorly tolerated rhythm at clinical presentation and absence of left ventricular aneurysm were also associated with a poorly tolerated arrhythmia recurrence. Only 3 of 57 patients who had a well tolerated arrhythmia induced on electrophysiologic testing during amiodarone therapy had recurrence of a poorly tolerated arrhythmia versus 19 of 47 who had hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias induced during amiodarone therapy (p less than 0.001). Thus, electrophysiologic testing during amiodarone therapy appears useful in identifying patients who are prone to have catastrophic arrhythmia recurrences and could allow for the institution of additional or alternative modes of therapy.\r"

Eighty patients (65 men, 15 women), whose mean age was 58 years, presented with one of the following: sustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 54); sudden death requiring resuscitation (n = 4); ventricular fibrillation (n = 11); or syncope thought to be of cardiac origin (n = 11). All patients had 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiograms and programmed electrical stimulation while receiving no antiarrhythmic therapy. Programmed electrical stimulation resulted in inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (defined as a rate of greater than or equal to 120 beats/min for greater than or equal to 1 minute or requiring intervention) in 53 of the 80 patients. There was no measure of frequency or complexity of spontaneous arrhythmia detected on ambulatory ECG that could identify the degree of subsequent ventricular tachycardia inducibility during programmed electrical stimulation. In fact, 25% of patients who had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia had little or no spontaneous arrhythmia on ambulatory ECG. Furthermore, of the 53 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, 28 and 55% had no couplets or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, respectively, during ambulatory monitoring. The combination of a clinical presentation of sustained ventricular tachycardia, confirmed coronary artery disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30% had a better positive predictive value than did any ambulatory ECG criterion in predicting the inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Of 209 patients who underwent successful multilesion coronary angioplasty, 55 symptomatic and 74 asymptomatic patients were restudied an average of 7 +/- 4 months after dilation. The restenosis rate was 82% (45 of 55) in the symptomatic patients and 30% (22 of 74) in the asymptomatic patients (p less than 0.001). Only 4% of the asymptomatic patients had restenosis at more than one dilation site. When only patients who developed a restenosis were considered, the restenosis occurred at more than one dilation site in 47% (21 of 45) of the symptomatic group versus 14% (3 of 22) of the asymptomatic group (p less than 0.05). When all recurrent stenoses were examined, the severity of the luminal narrowing was greater than or equal to 70% in 64% (45 of 70) of the stenotic lesions in the symptomatic patients versus 31% (8 of 26) of the stenotic lesions in the asymptomatic patients (p less than 0.05). Proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease, increased length of the stenotic narrowing, male gender and diabetes were associated with an increased incidence of restenosis by multivariate analysis. Patient-related variables were not predictive of multilesion restenosis. In conclusion, the majority of patients are clinically improved after multilesion coronary angioplasty. Recurrent symptoms after multilesion coronary angioplasty are frequently associated with multilesion restenosis and a more severe degree of restenotic narrowing. Restenosis at more than one dilation site is uncommon in the asymptomatic patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The percent stenosis and minimal cross-sectional area were measured before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and compared with radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function before and after angioplasty in 41 patients with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery lesions, providing 82 points of comparison. The gradient could be measured for 75 comparisons. Forty stenoses less than 50% were associated with a mean left ventricular exercise ejection fraction of 0.66 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- SD), 25 stenoses from 50 to 75% with a mean ejection fraction of 0.59 +/- 0.12 and 17 stenoses greater than 75% with a mean ejection fraction of 0.49 +/- 0.08.

These data document a relation between the magnitude of coronary artery stenosis and associated gradient to exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction in homogeneous patient groups. However, discordance of these variables occurs commonly in individual patients.\r"

Eighteen patients were in cardiogenic shock (12%) including four patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the angioplasty procedure. Hospital mortality was 9%, with 7 of 13 deaths occurring in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or intractable ventricular arrhythmia. Hospital mortality was 5% in patients with successful angioplasty versus 37% in those with unsuccessful angioplasty (p less than 0.001). In the immediate period after angioplasty, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower for patients with lesions of the left anterior descending artery (34 +/- 10%) than for patients with lesions of the left circumflex or right coronary artery (43 +/- 11%). In patients with successful angioplasty, significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 13 +/- 12% (p less than 0.001) for those with lesions of the left anterior descending artery and 10 +/- 12% (p less than 0.001) for those with lesions of the left circumflex or right coronary artery.

  ".W": "To develop an approach to predicting adverse events after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 50 patients had thallium-201 exercise testing within 1 month after successful single vessel coronary angioplasty and were followed up for a mean of 18 months. Adverse events were: 1) clinical events consisting of recurrent angina (17 patients) and myocardial infarction (1 patient); 2) treatment events consisting of repeat coronary angioplasty (10 patients) and coronary bypass surgery (1 patient); and 3) restenosis, defined as a greater than 30% increase in luminal stenosis (15 of 38 recatheterized patients). There were no deaths. Of the clinical, exercise, angiographic and thallium scan variables analyzed by stepwise logistic regression, postangioplasty gradient greater than 20 mm Hg predicted clinical events and treatment events, and the number of segments with slower thallium clearance predicted clinical events, treatment events and restenosis. Using Cox Hazards model regression of survival without events, the number of transient qualitative thallium defects also predicted clinical events and restenosis. At 1 year after angioplasty, 24% of patients with these variables had restenosis compared with only 6% of those without these variables and 36% of patients with these variables had a clinical or treatment event compared with 8% of patients without these variables. Three measures of the adequacy of myocardial perfusion (post-angioplasty gradient, reduced thallium clearance and transient thallium defects) were additive predictors of adverse events after coronary angioplasty with the relative risk being approximately four times greater in patients with these variables than in those without. Such adverse events, therefore, are usually a consequence of inadequate revascularization.\r"

Changes in great cardiac vein flow were measured using a thermodilution technique in 13 patients with acute infarction; 3 received intracoronary streptokinase and 10 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Average great cardiac vein flow during left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was 62 +/- 6 ml/min and increased to 70 +/- 7 ml/min (p = 0.039) after arterial recanalization. There was significant individual variability in the great cardiac vein flow increments that was highly predictive of functional recovery as expressed by the change in ejection fraction at 7 to 10 days (r = 0.93, p = 0.0008). Incremental great cardiac vein flow was inversely correlated with the degree of residual stenosis and the duration of ischemia (r = 0.88, p = 0.0007). Patients with residual stenosis less than or equal to 50% had a significantly larger increase in great cardiac vein flow (14 +/- 5 ml/min) than did those with residual stenosis greater than 50% (0 +/- 2 ml/min, p = 0.026). Neither preinterventional left ventricular ejection fraction, hemodynamics nor age predicted incremental great cardiac vein flow. Therefore, quantitative measurements of great cardiac vein flow during medical revascularization in patients with an acute anterior myocardial infarction demonstrate variable reflow that is physiologically significant. A high grade residual stenosis and prolonged period of ischemia limit large increases in flow and prevent functional recovery. This study emphasizes the fact that recanalization in itself cannot be used as an indicator of the success of interventions designed to produce myocardial reperfusion.\r"

All patients underwent baseline drug-free invasive electrophysiologic studies. Seventy-five patients (group I) had inducible ventricular arrhythmias (including nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) and 33 patients (group II) had no inducible arrhythmias. Noninducibility was not predictive of a favorable outcome, because the incidence of both sudden death and recurrent ventricular tachycardia was similar in the two groups. Treatment guided by electrophysiologic testing was used in 17 patients; in 13 (17%) in group I arrhythmias became noninducible, and in 4 (5%) sustained ventricular arrhythmias became nonsustained after administration of conventional drugs. There was a significantly higher incidence of sudden death and recurrent ventricular tachycardia in the 4 patients with inducible arrhythmias (n = 3, 75%) compared with the 13 patients whose arrhythmias were noninducible (n = 2, 15%) (p less than 0.05). For the group as a whole, 11% died suddenly and 15% had recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. Sixty-four patients were treated with amiodarone and, of these, four (6%) died suddenly during the follow-up period and nine (14%) had recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias could be induced in 69% of patients with aborted sudden death but inducibility could be suppressed in only 20% of them. The role of therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing could therefore not be fully assessed. The findings reveal a significant recurrence rate of symptomatic, potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in medically treated patients with aborted sudden death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are commonly used in combination with digitalis to control excessive heart rate during exercise in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. However, little is known about the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on exercise capacity in these patients. Accordingly, a randomized, double-blind, cross-over placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the efficacy of celiprolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocker with partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on exercise performance in nine men with chronic atrial fibrillation. All but one patient was receiving maintenance digitalis during the study. Heart rate, blood pressure and gas exchange variables were measured at rest and during treadmill exercise testing while the patients were receiving maintenance celiprolol or placebo. Significant reductions in heart rate and systolic blood pressure compared with control values were observed at submaximal exercise, at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold and at maximal exertion while the patients were taking celiprolol. However, oxygen uptake at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold during celiprolol therapy was 12.3 versus 14.0 ml oxygen/kg per min during placebo administration (a 12% difference, p less than 0.01). Similarly, oxygen uptake at maximal exertion during celiprolol therapy was 17.6 versus 21.0 ml/kg per min during placebo administration (a 16% difference, p less than 0.01). Treadmill time was also reduced during the celiprolol phase compared with placebo (11.3 versus 10.3 minutes; a 19% difference, p less than 0.01). These results indicate that in patients with atrial fibrillation the major beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade--reduced submaximal and maximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure--must be weighed against the decrease in exercise capacity.\r"

Nine men with coronary artery disease, aged 57 +/- 2 years, who had completed 12 months of supervised intense exercise training were restudied after 6 additional years during which they continued to exercise. The first 12 months of training resulted in a 44% increase in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) from 25.0 +/- 1.3 to 35.9 +/- 1.5 ml X kg-1 X min-1 (p less than 0.001). The VO2max after 6 additional years (total 7 years) of intense training was 36.8 +/- 2.4 ml X kg-1 X min-1. Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration increased from 38 +/- 3 to 45 +/- 4 mg X dl-1 at 12 months and rose further to 53 +/- 5 mg X dl-1 at 6 years of follow-up (p less than 0.05).

Although the maximal heart rate-pressure product was 14% higher after 12 months of training, maximal ST segment depression was significantly less, 0.27 +/- 0.06 versus 0.19 +/- 0.04 mV (p less than 0.05); this improvement was maintained after 6 years of additional training. These data provide evidence that the beneficial effects of a program of intense exercise training can be maintained for long periods in some motivated patients with coronary artery disease who continue to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Although significant pressure gradients can be recorded across the left ventricular outflow tract in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, controversy exists regarding the presence or absence of true obstruction. Ten patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied at the time of septal myectomy. A sterile continuous wave Doppler transducer was placed on the ascending aorta and directed toward the left ventricular outflow tract to measure velocity simultaneously with invasive gradient measured using solid-state hub transducers by direct puncture of the left ventricle and aorta. Simultaneous Doppler velocity and invasive gradient measurements (n = 33) were made at rest, before and after myectomy and during interventions with isoproterenol, volume loading and phenylephrine. High velocity flow with a characteristic contour was recorded in patients with a significant gradient. Using the modified Bernoulli equation (gradient = 4 X velocity), a good correlation was found between the Doppler-derived gradient and the peak instantaneous gradient measured invasively (r = 0.93, y = 0.89X + 12, p = 0.0001). Changes in gradient and velocity due to interventions also correlated well (r = 0.96, y = 0.91X - 3, p = 0.0001). Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography can accurately estimate the outflow tract gradient. The magnitude, timing and contour of these high velocity flow signals support the hypothesis that true obstruction is present in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who have a significant gradient.\r"

Electrophysiologic testing had a specificity of 48.3% and a low predictive accuracy (18.9%) when using the shortest RR interval (less than or equal to 250 ms) to identify the risk for sudden death. Continuous pre-excitation after disopyramide (2 mg/kg body weight, intravenously) had a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 26.1% and predictive accuracy of 12.8% for identifying patients with sudden death. Continuous pre-excitation during an exercise test identified these patients with a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 28.6% and a predictive accuracy of 11.8%. These noninvasive tests could also be used to predict the shortest RR interval observed during induced atrial fibrillation. Continuous pre-excitation on both tests used in combination had a sensitivity of 91.2%, a specificity of 66.7% and a predictive accuracy of 75.6% for predicting the shortest RR interval less than or equal to 250 ms. Thus, both invasive and noninvasive techniques have a good sensitivity but a low specificity for identifying patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and sudden death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-five patients were examined at autopsy; 8 of them underwent lead implantation only and 17 received both leads and the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Twelve patients (48%) died of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation; seven (28%) died of other causes. Acute pericarditis occurred in all patients, resulting in a localized, progressive fibrosis around the apical patch lead without giving rise to pericardial restriction. Thrombus formation was associated with the superior vena cava spring electrode in four patients (17%) and the right ventricular rate-sensing electrode in one patient (4%). Asymptomatic pulmonary emboli occurred in two patients (8%). In one patient who underwent defibrillation 59 times, superior vena cava changes consisted of vein wall destruction, fibrosis and thrombus formation. Pathologic changes under the apical patch related to defibrillation were observed in seven patients; two of these had fewer than 5 defibrillations, one had 8 defibrillations and four had 21 to 74 defibrillations. These changes consisted of contraction band necrosis in four patients, vacuolar cytoplasmic clearing and loss of myocytes confined to the myocardium under the patch electrode in five patients who had multiple defibrillations. The observed pathologic changes were estimated to affect less than 2% of the total myocardial mass. Thus, the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead system and multiple defibrillations result in localized myocardial injury confined to the tissue under the patch electrode.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative modification of the atrioventricular (AV) node to prolong refractoriness could be an alternative to His bundle ablation in patients with refractory supraventricular arrhythmias. It was postulated that a cryosurgical lesion at the posterior interatrial septum in the closed heart could achieve this. An electrophysiologic study was performed in anesthetized dogs. The AV fat pad was mobilized to expose the posteroseptal region. A cryoprobe cooled to 0 to -10 degrees C was moved in the exposed region until reversible AV block indicated proximity of the AV node. The probe was then cooled to -70 degrees C for 30 seconds. Four weeks later, five dogs had a favorable result with a mean prolongation of Wenckebach cycle length of 45 +/- 7% (p less than 0.05). Two dogs had complete heart block. Decreased (one dog) or increased (one dog) duration of freezing resulted in no change and complete heart block, respectively. Histologic examination verified partial damage to the AV node with preservation of the His bundle. Thus, controlled cryoinjury to modify AV node function is feasible in the closed heart; preservation of AV conduction provides an advantage over His bundle ablation.\r"

Chloralose-anesthetized, open chest dogs (n = 25) with ventricular tachycardia were studied. The left anterior descending artery was cannulated distally. Intracoronary infusions of adenosine, 10(-7) to 10(-5) M, did not alter the rate of ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia slowed by 4.6% with adenosine, 10(-4) M. RPIA, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of ventricular tachycardia when injected into the left anterior descending coronary artery. This effect of RPIA was reversed by the adenosine antagonist aminophylline, 10(-5) M. After bilateral stellate ganglionectomy, RPIA, 10(-5) M, did not, but metoprolol, 0.5 mg, did slow ventricular tachycardia after intracoronary injection. However, RPIA, 10(-5) M, produced a 43% decrease in the increment in ventricular tachycardia occurring during sympathetic neural stimulation. Therefore, when injected into the left anterior descending artery, adenosine, 10(-4) M, and RPIA, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, decrease the rate of ventricular tachycardia in 24 hour old myocardial infarction. Furthermore, this decrease in the rate of ventricular tachycardia is the result of prejunctional sympathetic antagonism.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of truncated exponential waveform shocks using a cardioverter-defibrillator catheter with and without a 13.9 cm2 subcutaneous thoracic patch electrode was examined in 10 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The cardioverter-defibrillator catheter was positioned through the external jugular vein with the distal 4 cm2 shocking electrode located in the right ventricular apex and the 8 cm2 proximal electrode located in the superior vena cava. Four electrode configurations were tested: 1) distal electrode (cathode) to proximal electrode and chest wall patch (common anodes), 2) distal electrode (cathode) to chest wall patch (anode), 3) distal electrode (cathode) to proximal electrode (anode), and 4) chest wall patch (cathode) to proximal electrode (anode). The lowest randomized energy resulting in termination of alternating current-induced ventricular fibrillation on four trials at that energy was 20.2, 21.3, 27.4 and greater than 40 J, respectively, for configurations 1 through 4. The energy requirements for configurations 1, 2 and 3 were significantly lower than for configuration 4 (p less than 0.001). Additionally, configurations incorporating the distal electrode and the patch electrode (configurations 1 and 2) were significantly better than the catheter alone (configuration 3; p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between configurations 1 and 2. In conclusion, the addition of a subcutaneous chest wall electrode to the cardioverter-defibrillator catheter significantly lowered energy requirements for defibrillation, suggesting that a nonthoracotomy approach for the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is feasible.\r"

  ".W": "Contrast produced by differences in regional proton relaxation times (T1 and T2) provides the potential to assess the extent of myocardial infarction using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. Previous laboratory studies have shown that longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times are prolonged in acute myocardial infarction, and these prolongations have been attributed entirely to increases in tissue water content. The present study seeks to evaluate the relation between both T1 and T2 and regional myocardial perfusion and water content throughout a wide range of blood flow reduction. The left anterior descending coronary artery and collateral vessels supplying a region of the anterior wall of the left ventricle were ligated in 10 dogs for 4 hours until they were killed. Both water proton and bulk proton relaxation times of myocardial samples from ischemic and control zones were measured at 200 and 20 MHz, respectively. Regions of severe ischemia (flow less than 5% of control) demonstrated no significant alteration in T1 compared with nonischemic myocardium. Greatest T1 and T2 elevations were observed in moderately ischemic myocardium (flow = 5 to 50% of control). The water relaxation behavior differed with the severity of the flow reduction and was not totally dependent on changes in water content. These data suggest that relaxation time alterations are more complex than previously reported in myocardial ischemic insult. In the future, using T1 weighted imaging methods, myocardial ischemic insults associated with severe reductions in blood flow would be anticipated to demonstrate a doughnut pattern with an area of abnormal intensity in the peripheral zone surrounding a central ischemic zone with normal intensity.\r"

  ".W": "Subaortic obstruction caused by either a restrictive bulboventricular foramen in single left ventricle with an outflow chamber or by a restrictive ventricular septal defect in tricuspid atresia with transposition of the great arteries can lead to a hypertrophied, noncompliant ventricle and excessive pulmonary blood flow. This combination is disadvantageous to potential Fontan procedure candidates because they are dependent on good ventricular function and low pulmonary vascular resistance for survival. The results of surgical procedures to directly or indirectly relieve significant subaortic obstruction (gradient greater than 30 mm Hg) in 24 patients, 16 with single left ventricle and 8 with tricuspid atresia, were reviewed. Four patients had a left ventricular apex to descending aorta valved conduit; none survived. Seven patients had resection of subaortic tissue; four survived and four developed heart block at surgery. Adequate gradient relief was evident in only one of the four survivors. Thirteen patients had a main pulmonary artery to ascending aorta anastomosis or conduit; six survived. All survivors had adequate gradient relief. The overall survival was 42% (10 of 24). None of seven patients with a subaortic gradient greater than 75 mm Hg survived. These data show that: Surgical relief of established subaortic obstruction in patients with single left ventricle and tricuspid atresia carries a high mortality rate, especially if the subaortic gradient is greater than 75 mm Hg. The best procedure appears to be the pulmonary artery to ascending aorta anastomosis. A clearer understanding of the factors leading to the development of significant subaortic obstruction is necessary to prevent it or to devise improved therapeutic strategies.\r"

Thirty-four healthy young adolescent male volunteers (mean age 13 years) were recruited. Submaximal exercise was performed by supine bicycle ergometry. Cardiac output was calculated as mean velocity X cross-sectional area. Successful rest and exercise determinations of cardiac output were obtained in 81% (n = 52) of the studies. Mean cardiac output increased from 4.6 to 8.9 liters/min (p less than 0.001) during exercise and mean oxygen consumption increased from 212 to 899 ml/min (p less than 0.001). Doppler-estimated rest and exercise cardiac outputs correlated well with simultaneously measured oxygen consumption (r = 0.89, SEE = 1.2 liters/min; y = 0.006 X 3.2 liters/min). Mean exercise factor was 6.4 (1.2 SD). Twenty-six pairs of rest and exercise cardiac output determinations by Doppler technique and indirect Fick method were simultaneously compared in a subset population (r = 0.86, SEE = 1.4 liters/min; slope = 0.93, y intercept = 1.4 liters/min). Results of this study demonstrate that cardiac output and exercise factor can be estimated by pulsed Doppler echocardiography during exercise.\r"

The audio signal was musical in quality and the regurgitant flow pattern was bidirectional and striated. There were 4 to 6 striations in the mitral and 18 in the aortic regurgitant jets per 100 cm/s length of signal. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound localized the jet to the valve in all cases although angiography failed to localize it in one of four cases. At surgery each valve had a tear in or partial disintegration of one cusp whereas the other two cusps were intact, mobile and of normal thickness. The Doppler appearance is thought to be caused by fluttering of the disrupted cusp leading to the shedding of families of vortices in both a retrograde and an orthograde direction. It is suggested that this is likely to be a useful sign for the diagnosis of cusp tears.\r"

On four occasions, each separated by a minimum of 3 weeks, a 6 mg/kg intravenous aminophylline dose was infused during 30 minutes, and multiple blood samples were obtained thereafter. The pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance (Cl), volume of distribution, and half-life were determined by noncompartmental analysis. There was evidence for within-subject variability in these parameters. In comparison to the first study day, Cl changed by greater than 15% in all but one subject and by greater than 25% in two of six subjects. Changes in half-life exceeding 25% of the value observed on the first study day occurred in three of six subjects. Within-subject coefficient of variation for Cl was 14.9% (range 3.9% to 33.3%) and 14.4% (range 5.8% to 24.3%) for half-life. Volume of distribution, however, was a more stable parameter with a within-subject coefficient of variation of 7.2% (range 2.3% to 11.1%). Thus, within-subject changes in the pharmacokinetics of theophylline do exist over time. These data suggest that close monitoring of patients receiving theophylline is warranted, particularly when theophylline concentrations are maintained at either extreme of the therapeutic range.\r"

The results were compared to five patients with red cedar asthma who became asymptomatic after removal from exposure to red cedar for more than 2 months and 31 healthy subjects without asthma. The LAR was found to be associated with an increase in eosinophils in the lavage fluid, an increase in sloughing of bronchial epithelial cells, and an increase in degenerated cells consisting mainly of degenerated epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. There was an increase in vascular permeability as reflected by an increase in albumin in the lavage fluid. Although there was a slight but significant increase in neutrophils 48 hours after bronchial challenge, neutrophil infiltration was not a prominent feature earlier. The potential role of loss of epithelial cells to account for an increase in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness after an LAR was discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cetirizine, a major human metabolite of hydroxyzine, preserves the histamine H1-antagonist activity of the parent compound but poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, thus minimizing sedative and anticholinergic effects. In 10 young (mean age 27.7 years) subjects with mild asthma (FEV1 greater than 70% predicted), we evaluated the bronchodilator and protective efficacy of 5, 10, and 20 mg of cetirizine against bronchospasm induced by histamine inhalation (0.03 to 20 mg/ml) in comparison with placebo and hydroxyzine, 25 mg, using a random, double-blind crossover design. The provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% decline in FEV1 for all 10 subjects from the postdiluent control value was more than fourfold greater after each active drug than after placebo. Cetirizine, 5 to 20 mg, provided significantly greater protection against histamine-induced bronchospasm than hydroxyzine (p less than 0.001); moreover, a dose-dependent protective effect was noted with cetirizine. Significant bronchodilation was also found: at 60 minutes, FEV1 increased significantly after all active antihistamines compared to placebo and after 20 mg of cetirizine compared to hydroxyzine (p less than 0.05). FEV1 increased significantly at 120 minutes after hydroxyzine and after cetirizine in both the 20 and 10 mg doses compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). We conclude that in subjects with mild asthma, orally administered cetirizine provides significant dose-dependent protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, which in the doses studied is superior to that produced by the parent compound, hydroxyzine. In addition, cetirizine in 5 to 20 mg doses causes acute bronchodilation. These results suggest a possible role of cetirizine in asthma therapy.\r"

Gp-1 beta-b as well as Gp-1 and the intact antigen was capable of inducing a remarkable erythema in the skin of patients with asthma with sea squirt allergy at its concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. N-Glycoside GP fractions (Gp-1 beta-a and Gp-2 beta) having the allergenic activity were also prepared as alkali-resistant GPs from Gp-1 and the other relatively small size GP fraction (Gp-2) of the Pronase digest, respectively, after the alkali treatment. Chemically, the three allergenically active preparations were rich in galactosamine, glucosamine, and fucose in common, although the N-linked carbohydrates were much larger in size than O-linked carbohydrates. Accordingly, it has been expected that the epitope of the sea squirt antigen corresponds to certain oligosaccharide units residing in both of the O- and N-linked carbohydrate chains of the antigen. This suggestion was consistent with the observation that the allergenic activity of Gi-rep was significantly unstable to the periodate oxidation but substantially stable not only to acid, alkali, and heat treatments but also to the enzymatic proteolysis with Pronase E.\r"

  ".W": "Children with chronic asthma frequently receive \"bursts\" (less than 7 days) of short-term, high-dose prednisone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) for acute exacerbations of their disease. Certain of these patients may also require inhaled corticosteroids (IC) for control. The effect of these \"bursts\" on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) is unclear. To test the integrity of the HPAA in such patients, we measured plasma cortisol (F) in response to serial administration of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (nadir = 34 +/- 1.2 mg/dl; mean +/- SE), followed by 250 micrograms/1.73 m2 of synthetic ACTH in the following children with asthma: group I, seven patients who received no more than one \"burst\" per year (0.71 +/- 0.2); group II, six individuals who received more than one \"burst\" per year (3.6 +/- 0.2) and no IC; and group III, 10 subjects who received more than one \"burst\" per year (4.7 +/- 0.3) plus IC. All patients received daily theophylline and beta-agonists; seven patients were taking sodium cromolyn. No patients received troleandomycin. Compared to group I (control subjects), 16% of group II had a subnormal response of F to hypoglycemia. In addition, a subnormal response of F to hypoglycemia or ACTH was documented in 20% and 10% of group III, respectively. All individuals with a subnormal response of F to either hypoglycemia or ACTH received four or more \"bursts\" per year. We conclude that as a group, children affected by asthma treated with \"bursts\" alone or \"bursts\" plus IC appear to have a normal HPAA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The intensity of intracellular fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. In 13 atopic subjects, two denuded skin blister bases were challenged for 5 hours with pollen antigen and two blister bases with buffer. Both the level of histamine and mean number of cells recovered at antigen sites were greater than at buffer sites. Oxidation of DCFH-DA by neutrophils recovered from both antigen and buffer sites was significantly greater than that of autologous peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs), reflecting an increase in the spontaneous generation H2O2 of cells recovered from the sites of inflammation. DCFH-DA oxidation by cells recovered from sites of antigen incubation was significantly greater than cells from buffer site incubations. Neutrophils from both antigen and buffer sites could be stimulated further in vitro by phorbol myristate acetate to the same level of H2O2 generation as phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated PBNs. In five subjects studied, the noncellular component of chamber fluids collected at 1 and 5 hours stimulated PBNs to increase their oxidative metabolism by 42% to 62%; however, this increased level of intracellular H2O2 was still much less than the spontaneous H2O2 generation observed in cells recovered from sites of allergic inflammation. The increased oxidative metabolism of neutrophils in human allergic and inflammatory skin reactions has important pathophysiologic implications for the role of these cells in inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".W": "A previous study of cold air challenge (CACh) in children with asthma produced indirect evidence for the existence of a reaction plateau. To examine directly this phenomenon, 17 children, mean age 13 1/2 years, were challenged by isocapnic hyperventilation with -10 degrees C air at 75% of maximal voluntary ventilation for 10 minutes (extended CACh [ECACh]). Each minute FEV1 and maximum expiratory flow at 25% remaining vital capacity (V25) were measured. During \"recovery\" these measurements were repeated every minute for 10 minutes. Analysis of the cumulative dose-response curves constructed from the measurements revealed that a reaction plateau was reached in the last minutes of the challenge by both functions in each child. Induced changes in absolute terms were similar for both functions (FEV1: -28 +/- 12% predicted; V25: -29 +/- 17% predicted), but V25 started at a lower baseline (FEV1: 81 +/- 15% predicted; V25: 48 +/- 27% predicted) and thus arrived at a higher degree of obstruction (FEV1: 53 +/- 19% predicted; V25: 19 +/- 13% predicted). Together with the reaction plateau developing faster for V25, this indicated a dose-response influenced by baseline small airway obstruction. Although the size of the reaction differed from one child to the other (FEV1: -5% to -50% predicted; V25: -4% to -77% predicted), interindividual variability in the development of the reaction decreased toward the end of the challenge and was minimal at the plateau and in the early minutes of \"recovery.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen healthy adults (six women and 10 men), 19 to 35 years of age, received each of the drugs and placebo for 2 days, separated by 5 days at home. Each day, the drug or placebo was administered at 8 A.M. and 12 and 4 P.M. Diphenhydramine was administered in three equal doses (50 mg), and loratadine was administered in a single dose followed by two placebo doses. Mean latency to sleep on tests done at 9 and 11 A.M. and 1, 3, and 5 P.M. was reduced significantly with diphenhydramine compared to placebo, whereas neither loratadine dose reduced sleep latency. Performance measured at 9:30 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. with a battery of tests, including reaction time, vigilance, digit symbol substitution, and symbol copying tasks demonstrated a significant reduction in symbols copied and digits substituted after diphenhydramine compared to both loratadine doses. These results demonstrate that loratadine (10 and 40 mg doses) did not have clinically significant central nervous system activity, whereas diphenhydramine increases sleepiness and disrupts performance efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Fuel metabolism in individuals with well-controlled diabetes is similar to that occurring in persons who do not have diabetes. During the initial phase of physical exercise, muscle glycogen is the primary source of fuel. As exercise continues, blood glucose and free fatty acids (FFAs) become increasingly important substrates. FFAs become the major fuel source as glucose utilization decreases. Whereas in individuals who do not have diabetes, blood glucose levels vary little during exercise, the person with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) may experience an increase in blood glucose, a modest decrease, or a marked decrease, which can result in hypoglycemia. In insulin-treated persons with mild hyperglycemia, exercise is accompanied by a fall in blood glucose. In contrast, in persons with marked hyperglycemia and ketosis, exercise may cause a further rise in both blood glucose and ketone levels. The glycemic response to exercise is dependent on the plasma concentration of insulin. Physical training improves glucose tolerance in individuals with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); in persons with IDDM, it may diminish insulin requirements. The repletion of muscle and liver glycogen, which takes place for 24 to 48 hours after exercise, requires a minimum amount of insulin in addition to carbohydrate feeding. Persons using insulin may need to increase food intake prior to, during, and after exercise and/or decrease insulin dosage as well. Persons with IDDM can exercise safely, and persons with NIDDM can achieve better control by following the guidelines outlined for exercise prescription.\r"

Eight lactating women over 37 years of age were compared with eight nulliparous women to determine differences in dietary intake of energy, protein, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. Anthropometric measurements, bone density measurements, serum calcium, serum phosphate, and serum alkaline phosphatase measurements were made at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum. Intakes of protein, vitamin D, and calcium were significantly lower in the diets of control women. No significant differences were found in biochemical analysis (except for a significantly lower serum phosphorus in the control group of women), bone density, nutrition assessment, or physical assessment between lactating and control groups. Thus, when dietary calcium intake is greater than the RDA for lactating women, bone mineral content is not affected during the first 6 weeks of lactation.\r"

Results from tabular and regression analyses indicated that the most effective and least costly methods for assessing mean intakes for groups of individuals were those using telephone and/or personal contact and collecting 24-hour recalls for several selected nonconsecutive days during the survey period. More specifically, it was concluded that the method including an initial personal interview for 24-hour recall followed by three telephone interviews for 24-hour recalls over a 1-year period and the method including four telephone interviews for 24-hour recalls for a 1-year period provided food energy intake data comparable with the data collected with other methods and with less effort or cost. Additional analyses were recommended to determine the numbers of days required to obtain estimates of usual intake for individuals and for diet components other than food energy.\r"

  ".U": "87251873\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of overall dietary variety, variety among major food groups, and variety within major food groups on dietary quality. Nutritional adequacy, one aspect of dietary quality, was measured by a Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR)--an index of the percent of recommended intake for 11 nutrients. Other dietary quality measures included the percent of calories from fat and sugar and total intakes of energy, cholesterol, and sodium. A study sample of 3,701 individuals was selected from USDA's 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, excluding pregnant and lactating women and children under 1 year of age. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships between each type of variety and each diet quality measure, controlling for age, sex, the number of foods, and all of their two-way interactions with variety. The variety terms added a significant increment to the variation in MAR that was explained by each of the models. Variety among five major food groups explained as much of the variation in MAR as did variety within those groups. Thus, dietary variety might best be defined as simply including foods from each of the major groups. Increases in this type of variety were associated with greater increases in MARs for females than for males and for persons with lower vs. higher numbers of foods. None of the types of variety could account for a sizeable proportion of the variation in the intakes of energy, fat, sugar, sodium, or cholesterol. That is, those measures were not related in any appreciable way to variety per se--either to the expansion or to the restriction of food choices. The key to limiting the intake of those constituents may be to selectively alter the scope of food choices to include more of some foods and less of others.\r"

Indicators of dietary iron adequacy calculated in this study were the amount of total iron, the amount of available iron, and the percent bioavailability. Mean daily iron intakes were 16.1 mg for boys and 11.1 mg for girls. Estimation of daily iron bioavailability showed that mean available iron from boys' diets, 1.38 mg, and from girls' diets, 0.91 mg, was not only below recommended levels but also below 10% bioavailability, the basis of the RDA for iron. Diets that met recommended levels of available iron had unusually high amounts of energy, ascorbic acid, and animal tissue foods. Patterns of iron bioavailability differed among eating occasions but were similar for boys and girls. The breakfast meal was lowest in the three indicators of dietary iron adequacy; the evening meal was highest. Snacks contributed substantial amounts of food energy but little available iron to the adolescents' diets. If, at each eating occasion, adolescents include foods that enhance iron absorption and foods that are rich in iron, they will increase amounts of available iron in their diets.\r"

Because of the severity of the protein restriction in this dietary approach, maintenance of adequate caloric intake is a concern. Acceptability of 27 low-protein products for potential use as sources of calories in the diet was evaluated. Twenty-three dietitians judged the products on the bases of appearance, taste, texture, and overall acceptability, using a scale of 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (highly acceptable). Sixty-seven percent of the products tested received scores of more than 2.5 in all categories. Products receiving the highest scores were vanilla cream wafers (4.0), low-protein gelatin (3.97), and chocolate chip cookies (3.78). Differences in calories and protein between brands of similar products are minimal; unfortunately, phosphorus and calcium data are lacking for many products. Cost in cents per calorie is 2 to 10 times greater than in conventional foods of the same type. The results show that there are a number of acceptable low-protein products that can be used to help ensure adequate energy intakes without sacrificing protein restriction in this dietary approach for chronic renal failure.\r"

A year later, more than 500 health experts from the government and the private sector met to develop specific quantifiable objectives for each of the areas outlined in Healthy People. Fifteen topics, including improved nutrition, were used to formulate a framework for 227 objectives that give directions for a national program of health promotion and disease prevention. In 1980, the Public Health Service published the report Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation. A mid-course review of the 1990 objectives has been conducted, and the results were published in 1986. In the nutrition area, it is apparent that some overall progress has been made, but data are insufficient to assess progress on several objectives, and others are unlikely of achievement by 1990. Ultimately, however, the success of the objectives depends on the recognition that they are national, not federal, goals that require commitment to their implementation by both the public and the private sector.\r"

N3 and FP chose to seek out alternate data when the USDA NDB provided no data for a certain nutrient. FP chose to use a large number of additional sources to supplement USDA Handbook No. 8. Although the USDA NDB was very complete for all nutrients listed except for vitamin E/total and copper, gaps are likely to continue to exist because the USDA NDB is and will be in continual revision as an increasing number of nutrients are reported for an ever-growing food supply. Therefore, in accordance with established local needs, the dietitian has the responsibility both for knowing the sources used in the microcomputer nutrient data base and for making sure that reported results are reasonable.\r"

Using data derived from Turkish provincial census returns for 1980 and related material, we performed a series of principal component (PC) regression analyses on the data. The results indicated that a greater proportion of elderly men were classified as \"head of household\" in provinces characterized by low levels of urbanization and industrialization and with high village populations. Labor force participation rates of elderly men also demonstrated a negative relationship to the modernization variables. In contrast, measures of educational and high-level employment status showed a positive relationship with these indexes. These latter variables may reflect historical processes of development and achievements gained earlier in life rather than the current status of elderly men in Turkey. Thus, the study provides strong support for the major tenets of modernization theory.\r"

This research presents an alternative projection method based on an epidemiological theory of aging and mortality change that is consistent with recent mortality transitions. The model is founded on the observation that recent mortality declines in the United States are attributable to improved life styles and advances in the prevention and treatment of degenerative diseases and that the risk of dying from such diseases is being redistributed (or delayed) from younger to older ages. A test using U.S. mortality and population data indicates that this alternative method is promising--particularly for projecting mortality rates from major chronic degenerative diseases among populations in middle and older ages.\r"

This study of 123 older West Texans examines the degree to which nine variables account for variation in both organized religious activities and private religious behavior. These include three social activity and interaction variables, three religion variables, and three personal variables (health, age, and income). Strength of religious conviction proved to be the strongest predictor of both types of religious participation. Multiple-regression analysis did not support the hypothesis that private religious activity is compensatory; that is, it does not make up for increased social or personal deprivation. Poor health, low income, reduced activity, and living alone did not predict higher levels of nonorganized religious behavior. However, strong kin/friend networks did predict high levels of private devotion. This research suggests that frequent interaction in a social network contributes to the spiritual well-being of elderly persons; that is, it affirms the wholeness of their lives.\r"

Comparisons were made with respect to the relative accuracy of the reports of respondents in three age groups: younger than 60, 60 through 69, and 70 or older. For many measures, no age differences were detected, and for those where age differences were observed, the older respondents were sometimes more accurate than the younger respondents. The potential consequences of measurement error are serious. Evidence to date, however, does not indicate consistently that these problems are any more serious for older respondents than for any other age group.\r"

Internal consistency reliabilities in the .8 range and interrater reliabilities from .58 to .97 are reported. Validity correlations with the Zung Depression, Robertson Short Mental Status, Kingston Dementia, and the Physical and Mental Impairment-of-function Evaluation (PAMIE) scales were all satisfactory. The applications and advantages of the use of MOSES are discussed.\r"

Thoracic blood volume and ventricular stroke volume decreased linearly with increasing g levels. Heart rates and diastolic pressures increased, but only at the higher g levels; however, the increases were significantly less in the 60- to 69-year-old men. The results indicate that thoracic blood volume and ventricular stroke volume are remarkably gravity dependent over the entire tilt range in all groups, the lesser heart rate and diastolic pressure responses in older participants are significant circulatory handicaps and may contribute to the increased incidence of postural hypotension in elderly persons, the sharp rise in vascular resistance at lower +g levels (when arterial pressure is unchanged) suggests that cardiopulmonary reflexes play an important role in human circulatory adjustment to the headup posture.\r"

Falls occurred in 36% of SDAT individuals versus 11% of controls. The higher frequency of falls in demented participants was not explained by greater neurologic deficit nor by increased drug use compared with controls. However, males with SDAT who reported falls, had higher mean blood pressures and were more likely to be medicated than males with SDAT who did not fall. These differences were not observed in women. Falls in SDAT participants were associated with an increased rate of institutionalization. SDAT is an important risk factor for serious falls, and falls are associated with loss of independence in demented patients.\r"

Some researchers have suggested that older adults encode information in a general fashion and are less sensitive to the specific contextual aspects of a memory situation due to limited processing resources. We investigated the hypothesis that age interacts with encoding specificity. Young and old adults studied target pictures in the presence or absence of pictorial cues factorially varied at encoding and retrieval. If the older adults used the specific cuing information differently from the younger adults, age should have interacted with the encoding and retrieval variables. The results provided no evidence for such an interaction and indicated that both ages showed evidence of encoding specificity. To investigate the role of processing resources in encoding specificity, old and young adults also studied the pictures while simultaneously performing a digit-monitoring task. The divided-attention manipulation also did not interact with age, as both young and old adults showed encoding specificity effects of comparable magnitude in both control and divided-attention conditions.\r"

We analyzed the factorial invariance by testing hypotheses involving the equivalence constraints of one or more parameter matrices in the White and the Black samples. Data for the research came from the 1968 National Senior Citizens Survey and the 1974 Harris National Council on Aging Survey, Myths and Reality of Aging in America. Analysis of covariance structures, or LISREL, was used to assess the factorial invariance of both the PGC Morale Scale and the LSIA. Race differences were found in the factorial structure of the PGC Morale Scale, but not in the structure of LSIA. In particular, consistent race differences in measurement error variances were found for two items of the PGC Morale Scale.\r"

B-EP levels were not different at rest (31.8 +/- 3.3 and 25.3 +/- 4.1 pg/ml in the old and young groups, respectively), and both groups displayed similar responses to exercise. Specifically, we noted no change in B-EP during the final stage of exercise followed by a significant rise for the recovery period (40.0 +/- 3.7 and 38.1 +/- 5.0 pg/ml in the aged and young groups, respectively). Post-exercise reports of anxiety and depression were unchanged in either group, and only minor changes in hostility were noted, as measured by the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. These results demonstrate a similar serum B-EP response in older men compared to young men following graded maximal exercise and support the contention that circulatory changes in B-EP may not be related to changes in specific affective states.\r"

In three of these groups food consumption was restricted to 60% of ad libitum intake for varying fractions of the life span. Two groups of rats were fed ad libitum, and in one of these, the protein content of the food was limited to 60% of that consumed by the control group. Composition and contractile function were measured in lateral omohyoideus and soleus muscles. The data revealed a striking absence of functional change in these muscles with age and diet. Only minor changes in composition were found. The results suggest that the fibers present in the muscles of aged rats are functionally intact and are unaffected by long-term dietary restriction. Thus, age-related deficiencies of motor function are probably related to other factors, such as those associated with neuromuscular transmission or propagation of nerve impulses.\r"

The other mab (14-30) is specific for Ts inducer factors and blocks suppression only after given after TNP-Spl. We also studied the surface phenotype of the Ts cells induced by AC injection of TNP-Spl. We show that at least two cells are required for the adoptive transfer of suppression in TNP-ACAID. One is Lyt-2+ and 14-12+, the other is I-J+. These Ts cells have the surface phenotype of Ts effector cells as seen in other systems.

When the total isomers of InsP3 were measured, levels rose about twofold in response to LPS or to lipid A and remained elevated for as long as 5 min. Lipid A, in the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml, induced elevated intracellular levels of Ca2+ as quantified by fluorescence with Quin 2 or with Fura 2. When single, adherent Fura 2-loaded macrophages were treated with lipid A, basal levels of calcium rose over 10 sec from approximately 55 nM to almost 600 nM. LPS, paradoxically, did not cause such substantial increases in intracellular calcium (i.e., increases of approximately 26 nM) when judged by Fura 2 fluorescence. LPS treatment led to enhanced phosphorylation of a characteristic set of proteins, similar to those induced by stimulating protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol myristate acetate as previously reported. The enhanced phosphorylation of pp28, pp33, and pp67 in macrophages was evident by 15 min and optimal by 30 min. Taken together, these observations indicate that LPS and lipid A cause increased breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which led to enhanced intracellular levels of calcium and also to enhanced protein phosphorylation, presumably mediated by PKC. The data thus suggest that one major intracellular signal transduction mechanism, initiated by LPS and lipid A in macrophages, is the rapid breakdown of PIP2.\r"

The probes used were a full-length cDNA DR beta probe and a probe specific for the 3' untranslated region. The RFLP obtained represent the first standard patterns for the individual haplotypes DR1 through 7 and DR9 as defined by genetically homozygous lines. The patterns obtained reflect the DR specificities closely, as well as the DRw52 and DRw53 specificities. These latter specificities are associated with the most prominent patterns of RFLP. Bands are present which are unique for the haplotypes DR1, DR2, DR4, DR7, DRw52, and DRw53, and could be used for typing these haplotypes in heterozygotes. Subtypes can be identified for all of the haplotypes except DR1. These subtypes indicate that there is an extensive amount of polymorphism in the DR subregion that has not been identified serologically.\r"

These patterns reflect both DR haplotypes and DQ types of the cells tested. At least one non-polymorphic band is present in all the cell lines with every restriction enzyme except Hinc II. This band most probably represents DX beta hybridization. The polymorphic bands indicate that more polymorphism exists in the DQ subregion than is predicted serologically. Each DR haplotype is associated with a unique set of restriction fragments except for DR2 and DR6. The patterns are largely consistent within each DR haplotype. In addition, some bands reflect the established DQ specificities DQw1 and DQw2. Individual bands can be identified that are unique to the haplotypes DR1, DR4, DR5, and DR6 and the DQw1- and DQw2-associated haplotypes. Subdivisions of haplotypes can be identified with this probe. In particular, MVL (DR1), Akiba (DR2), QBL (DR3), FPF (DR5), and APD (DR6) have polymorphisms that distinguish them from other members of their DR haplotype.\r"

The PD6 SLA gene, although only 55% homologous to the other SLA class I sequences, is still a member of the family; its size and exon/intron organization are similar to other class I genes. When aligned with other SLA genes, exons 1 to 6 of PD6 have open reading frames; exon 7 contains a termination codon. PD6 is transcribed in transfected mouse L cells where its expression is enhanced by interferon. In vivo expression of PD6 is observed in a variety of tissues, with the highest levels in mature lymphoid tissues. Peripheral T cells contain high levels of PD6-specific RNA relative to B cells, whereas no PD6 transcripts are detectable in thymocytes.\r"

The effect was dose dependent at serotonin concentrations of 10(-4) to 10(-7) M, expressed at several effector to target cell ratios, and required the presence of accessory monocytes. A 5-HT1-specific receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, mimicked the enhancing properties of serotonin with similar potency. Equimolar concentrations of the mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist cyproheptadine, but not the 5-HT2-specific antagonist ketanserin, completely blocked the serotonin-induced NKCC enhancement. Monocyte/NK cell mixtures incubated with serotonin for 1 hr produced a soluble factor that could enhance the cytotoxicity of autologous, NK-enriched cells depleted of monocytes, which did not respond to serotonin alone. The factor displayed no IFN or IL 2 activity as judged by the lack of antiviral activity and inability to support the growth of an IL 2-dependent cell line. In the presence of monocytes, serotonin (10(-5) M) was considerably more effective than human IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma at optimal concentrations and was about equally effective as IL 2 at a final concentration of 50 U/ml in a short-term NK assay. The potency and efficacy for serotonin were similar to that earlier reported for histamine in monocyte-containing effector cells. The NKCC-enhancing effect of serotonin was additive to that induced by IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or IL 2, but not to histamine. The presented data suggest an earlier unrecognized, serotonin receptor-mediated regulation of human NK cells.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells release serotonin and other inflammatory mediators by a process that requires Ca2+ influx and increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, and is mimicked by Ca2+ ionophores. We report here that the Ca2+ response to antigen and to ionomycin has two components, a Ca2+ spike and a Ca2+ plateau. In nominally Ca2+-free medium, both components of the Ca2+ response are inhibited and secretion does not occur. In Na+-free medium, the initial Ca2+ spike induced by antigen or ionomycin occurs, but the plateau is again absent and secretion is inhibited by 30 to 50%. Secretion is also reduced by 10(-4) M amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+ transport pathways, and by 10(-5) M concentrations of two amiloride analogs with greater activity than amiloride, respectively, against Na+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Phorbol esters, which stimulate protein kinase C, enhance the Ca2+ plateau and secretion caused by suboptimal amounts of both antigen and ionomycin; this enhancement depends on extracellular Na+. The Na+ ionophore, monensin, mimics the Ca2+ plateau. From these data, we infer that the Ca2+ spike and plateau reflect separate responses of RBL-2H3 cells to antigen or ionomycin. We propose that the Ca2+ plateau results at least in part from the activation of a Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx pathway. One possible mechanism is that antigen binding stimulates a protein kinase C-regulated Na+ transport system. The resulting influx of Na+ may activate a Na+/Ca2+ antiporter that supports the Ca2+ plateau and mediator release.\r"

Soluble and fibrillar type I collagen-induced platelet aggregations were inhibited by purified IgG suggesting that soluble and fibrillar collagens shared a common receptor. The adhesion of platelets to an artificial collagen matrix was also inhibited by the monoclonal antibody. However, adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was not inhibited by the same amount of IgG that inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The results suggest that collagen-induced platelet aggregation is mediated through the interaction of collagen with the platelet receptor.\r"

In this study, we present direct evidence that NK cells can limit CVB3m replication both in vitro and in vivo. Virus titers are lowered in primary murine neonatal skin fibroblast (MNSF) cultures incubated with activated splenic large granular lymphocytes (LGL) taken from mice 3 days postinoculation of CVB3m, a time of maximal NK cell activity. The antiviral effect of this cell population is diminished by complement-mediated lysis with the use of anti-asialo GM1 antiserum but not with anti-Lyt-2 monoclonal antibody. Neither interferon nor anti-CVB3m-neutralizing antibody was detected in these cultures. Although activated LGL initiate lysis within CVB3m-infected MNSF in vitro within 3 hr of addition, they do not lyse uninfected MNSF cultures. CVB3m replication is required for expression of surface changes on MNSF that result in lysis by NK cells because cell cultures treated with compounds that prevent CVB3m replication are not killed by LGL. LGL also do not lyse MNSF cultures inoculated with UV-inactivated virus. Mice inoculated with activated LGL and subsequently challenged with CVB3m had reduced titers of virus in heart tissues in comparison to titers of CVB3m in heart tissues of mice not given LGL. The antiviral activity of the LGL preparation was abolished by prior treatment with anti-asialo GM1 antiserum plus complement but not by prior treatment with anti-Lyt-2 monoclonal antibody and complement. These data suggest that NK cells can specifically limit a nonenveloped virus infection by killing virus-infected cells.\r"

In this work the effects of retinoids on cAMP-dependent protein kinases of fibroblasts from 7 normal subjects and 7 psoriatic patients were studied. The levels of RI and RII (two forms of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases) present in control and retinoic acid-treated cells were quantitated by photoaffinity labeling with [8-azido-32P]cAMP. In psoriatic fibroblasts the levels of RII are decreased or undetectable compared with those of normal fibroblasts both in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. The amount of RI was normal in the cytosol of fibroblasts of 5 out of 7 patients and decreased in 2 patients. Membrane-associated levels of RI were decreased in 5 patients and normal in 2 patients. Retinoic acid treatment induces an increase in the amount of RI and RII regulatory subunits when they are deficient in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of psoriatic fibroblasts. Retinoic acid had no effect on RI and RII in normal fibroblasts. In addition, with in vitro retinoic acid treatment the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, measured in the fibroblasts of 4 psoriatic patients, was increased in the cytosol in 2 patients and in the membranes in all 4 patients. In these studies, comparable results were obtained with fibroblasts cultured from involved and uninvolved skin. This in vitro effect of retinoids on cAMP-dependent protein kinases in psoriatic fibroblasts may help to explain some of the in vivo therapeutic effects of retinoids.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Langerhans cell, antigen-presenting T6- DR+ epidermal cells (EC) appear 3 days following broad band ultraviolet radiation exposure of human skin and are responsible for the increased antigen presentation capacity of EC seen 3 days after UV exposure. To determine the UV wavelengths that induce T6- DR+ EC, volar forearm skin of 10 human volunteers was irradiated in vivo with 4 minimal erythema doses (MED) each of pure UVA (mean 482 J cm-2), UVB (mean 0.390 J cm-2), and UVC (mean 0.397 J cm-2). The purity of the light sources was as follows: UVB, 98% of the emission was in the UVB range; UVC, 97% of the irradiance was in the UVC range; UVA, 100% of the energy had wavelengths longer than 340 nm. Three days after UV irradiation with 4 MED of each wavelength band, suction blister-derived EC suspensions were prepared from the UV-exposed and unirradiated sites. Percentages of T6+ DR+ Langerhans cells (LC) and T6- DR+ EC were quantitated. Relative to control EC, which contained 2.4 +/- 0.3% T6+ DR+ LC, the mean percentage (+/- SEM) of T6+ DR+ LC contained within UV-exposed EC was significantly decreased as follows: UVB, 0.5 +/- 0.2%; UVC, 0.9 +/- 0.1%; UVA, 0.5 +/- 0.2% (n = 10). T6- DR+ EC, absent in control EC, were induced both by UVB, 5.2 +/- 1.7% and UVC; 1.5 +/- 0.4%. Despite the use of more than 1200 times greater doses in J cm-2 of UVA than UVB and UVC, UVA was a poor inducer of T6- DR+ EC (0.5 +/- 0.2%) and in about half of these individuals, T6- DR+ EC were undetectable. The UV wavelengths for induction of T6- DR+ EC lies predominantly within the UVB band, but also to a lesser extent within the UVC band. These wavelengths appear to be analogous to both the wavelengths for generation of increased host susceptibility to UV-induced murine tumors and to the wavelengths for UV-induced systemic suppression of contact hypersensitivity. However, our data indicate that UV wavelengths for decreasing the number of T6+ DR+ LC in humans differs from the wavelengths for induction of systemic suppression of contact hypersensitivity in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the appearance of T6- DR+ EC, but not the disappearance of T6+ DR+ LC, following UV exposure may be related to the induction of such antigen-specific suppressor T cells.\r"

All irritants used produced degenerative alterations of Langerhans cells (LCs). After application of 0.5% croton oil, however, this degeneration was preceded by an activation of the cells with increased number of mitochondria and enlargement of nuclei. The DNFB and PCl application in sensitizing doses to nonsensitized animals resulted in a cellular activation similar to that observed for 0.5% croton oil. In addition, these LCs showed enhanced adsorptive endocytosis as demonstrated by increased numbers of Birbeck granules and coated vesicles. The endocytotic activity was more pronounced in DNFB-sensitized animals. The DNTB at a concentration that induced tolerance to DNFB did not cause either cellular or endocytotic activation of LCs. These results demonstrate that the contact sensitizers DNFB and PCl induce characteristic cellular reaction patterns of LCs, which may be related to their sensitizing property.\r"

At 1.6 microgram/ml (4.6 microM) growth was completely inhibited, and the number of viable cells decreased remarkably during culture. The concentration needed for 50% growth inhibition (IC50) value of delta 7-PGA1 on PAM 212 cell growth was calculated as 0.4 microgram/ml (1.1 microM). At this concentration, the DNA synthesis in 24- and 48-h cultured cells was decreased to a half of the level in the control cells, and microscopically, remaining cells showed degenerative changes with many vacuoles in their cytoplasm. Prostaglandin D2, a major PG in mast cells, also showed potent cytotoxic activity. However, this action was expressed as 9-deoxy-delta 9,12-13,14-dihydro-PGD2 (delta 12-PGJ2), which was converted from PGD2 in plasma, and had a 3-fold stronger growth inhibitory activity than PGD2; the IC50 values of PGD2 and delta 12-PGJ2 were 2 micrograms/ml (5.7 microM) and 0.75 microgram/ml (2.1 microM), respectively. Among other PGs tested, PGA2 showed a comparable growth inhibitory activity, and PGB2, PGE1, and PGE2 less but significant activity. Prostaglandin F2 alpha and PGI2 however, had no such effect on cell proliferation at 5 micrograms/ml (14.3 microM) concentration, suggesting that cyclopentenone structure is an essential moiety of PG derivatives for cell growth inhibition. This cytotoxic action of delta 7-PGA1 and delta 12-PGJ2 appears to be independent of cyclic-AMP, since these PGs were virtually inactive in raising intracellular cyclic-AMP levels in PAM 212 cells.\r"
