Though much attention has focused on second messenger pathways, in recent years, progress has been made on elucidating the transcriptional events that lie more distally in the signal transduction process. Indeed, mitogens regulate the induction of several genes without the need for de novo protein synthesis. A subset of these so-called cellular immediate-early genes encode transcription factors. This review focuses on the early growth response group of zinc finger transcriptional factors. These genes are also induced by diverse agents in contexts outside of cell growth. Thus, their characterization should provide important insights into how cellular responses to diverse extracellular signals are mediated.\r"

  ".U": "91363819\r", 
  ".W": "Urodilatin, a closely related member of the atrial peptide family, was discovered recently in human urine. Urodilatin (ANP 95-126) is believed to be produced within the kidney and is natriuretic; evidence indicates that most of the ANP-like immunoreactivity in the kidney elutes with urodilatin rather than with ANP. Moreover, urodilatin is little affected by renal enzymes that inactivate atriopeptin. To determine the relative importance of urodilatin versus ANP in the regulation of renal sodium excretion, we studied intact and cardiac-denervated conscious dogs under three experimental conditions: (1) spontaneous sodium excretion, (2) intravenous infusion of saline, and (3) left atrial distension. Urodilatin was measured in urine with a newly developed radioimmunoassay that selectively measures urodilatin without any cross-reactivity with alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP); alpha-hANP was measured in plasma by radio-immunoassay because it is rapidly inactivated in the kidney by enzymatic activity. In each group of experiments, sodium excretion correlated better with urodilatin than it did with circulating alpha-hANP. The correlation coefficient (r value) between urodilatin excretion and renal sodium excretion exceeded 0.8 in 13 of 18 experiments and was below 0.6 in only 2 experiments. On the other hand, the correlation between circulating atriopeptin and sodium excretion exceeded 0.8 in only 3 of 18 experiments and was below 0.6 in 10 experiments. A negative correlation between plasma atriopeptin and renal sodium excretion was observed during left atrial distension in the cardiac-denervated dogs. These results and other considerations suggest that urodilatin, rather than atriopeptin, is the member of the ANP family that is primarily involved in the regulation of renal sodium excretion.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the efficacy of psychiatric liaison schemes to magistrates' courts in shortening the period that mentally ill accused people spend in custody between arrest, the provision of psychiatric reports, and admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 and to establish the direct costs of setting up such schemes. DESIGN--A nine month prospective study of court referrals and concurrent analysis of prison records. SETTING--An inner London magistrates' court (Clerkenwell) and a large remand prison (Brixton). PATIENTS--Consecutive series of 80 remand prisoners receiving psychiatric assessment through a liaison scheme; 50 remand prisoners placed on hospital orders by magistrates' courts after being remanded to prison for reports; 364 psychiatric prisoners undergoing second opinion assessments at a remand prison; 520 offenders in a remand prison placed on hospital orders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of lengths of time spent in custody for different stages of the assessment and disposal process. RESULTS--For the 50 remand prisoners assessed in prison the mean time from arrest to appearance in court with a psychiatric report was 33.7 days and from arrest to admission to hospital 50.8 days. For those examined in court under the liaison scheme the equivalent figures were 5.4 days (t = 12.63, p less than 0.0001) and 8.7 days (t = 13.04, p less than 0.0001). The number of hospital orders made at the court increased fourfold after the liaison scheme began. The additional direct costs of the scheme were negligible. CONCLUSION--Psychiatric liaison services to magistrates' courts can greatly reduce the length of time that offenders with mental disorders spend in custody. Such schemes may increase recognition of offenders suitable for admission to hospital. A scheme could be established in some areas within existing service provision.\r"

  ".W": "1. To further understand the vasodilator actions of atrial natriuretic peptide and its role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we studied the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in the isolated perfused rat lung during normoxic ventilation and after elevation of pulmonary artery pressure by either hypoxic ventilation or infusion of prostaglandin F2 alpha. Control animals were compared with littermates that had become adapted to a 10% O2 environment for 3 weeks. Atrial natriuretic peptide was compared with atriopeptin I and atriopeptin III in order to study its structure-activity relationship. 2. Five experiments, each involving six control and six chronically hypoxic rats, were performed. During normoxic ventilation, atrial natriuretic peptide (30 ng-3 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary artery pressure in chronically hypoxic rats, but had no action in the control animals. 3. Atrial natriuretic peptide dose-dependently abolished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to a greater extent in chronically hypoxic rats (EC50 98 ng) than in control rats (EC50 298 ng; P less than 0.001). Bolus atrial natriuretic peptide (100 ng) produced a plasma concentration of 22.6 pmol/l at 1 min, which is within the pathophysiological range. Initial plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were 9.4 pmol/l in control animals and 27.4 pmol/l in chronically hypoxic rats. 4. Chronically hypoxic rats were more sensitive to atriopeptin I, atriopeptin III and atrial natriuretic peptide than were the control rats (P less than 0.05). Atrial natriuretic peptide and atriopeptin III were equipotent and were 10 times more potent than atriopeptide I in both groups (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition resulted in improved nitrogen balance in septic rats: the cumulative nitrogen balance over the 4 days of treatment was the least negative as compared with other groups of septic rats. 4. The rate of loss of intracellular glutamine in skeletal muscle was markedly decreased (P less than 0.001) in response to glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in septic rats. 5. The rate of protein synthesis was increased (21.2%) and the rate of protein degradation was decreased (35.5%) in response to glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in septic rats. 6. It is concluded that the administration of glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition is beneficial to septic rats and possibly to septic patients.\r"

During major abdominal surgery there are increases in Factor VIII and plasminogen activator activity, associated with elevated plasma concentrations of vasopressin, of a magnitude shown to affect haemostasis. 2. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the haemostatic response to surgery, 12 patients undergoing fibre-optic colonoscopy were studied, of which six had a complete and six had an incomplete examination. 3. Venous blood samples were taken before, during and after the procedure for assay of plasma vasopressin, adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, Factor VIII coagulant activity, von Willebrand factor antigen level, euglobulin clot lysis time, tissue-type plasminogen activator activity and tissue-type plasminogen activator inhibition. 4. In the six patients who underwent a complete procedure the median plasma vasopressin concentration rose from 0.6 pg/ml to 153 pg/ml during colonoscopy. Factor VII coagulant activity rose from 0.9 to 2.4 i.u./ml and von Willebrand factor antigen level rose from 139 to 224%. Plasminogen activator activity increased from 20 to 144 units and tissue-type plasminogen activator activity rose from 107 to 1338 m-i.u./ml, whereas tissue-type plasminogen activator inhibition fell from 4.8 to 1.0 i.u./ml. 5. In the six patients in whom a limited procedure was performed, there were no changes in haemostatic function or in plasma vasopressin concentration. Plasma concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline did not change in either group. 6. The results indicate that vasopressin regulates the intrinsic coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic system in the absence of adrenaline release.\r"

The investigation focused upon patients with no previous cardiac or pulmonary disease in order to evaluate the clinical characteristics that were due only to PE. Acute PE was present in 117 patients and PE was excluded in 248 patients. Among the patients with PE, dyspnea or tachypnea (greater than or equal to 20/min) was present in 105 of 117 (90 percent). Dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic pain was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on room air was less than 80 mm Hg in 65 of 88 (74 percent). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was greater than 20 mm Hg in 76 of 88 (86 percent). The chest radiograph was abnormal in 98 of 117 (84 percent). Atelectasis and/or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were most common, 79 of 117 (68 percent). Nonspecific ST segment or T wave change was the most common electrocardiographic abnormality, in 44 of 89 (49 percent).

Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain or atelectasis or a parenchymal abnormality on the chest radiograph was present in 115 of 117 (98 percent). In conclusion, among the patients with pulmonary embolism that were identified, only a small percentage did not have these important manifestations or combinations of manifestations. Clinical evaluation, though nonspecific, is of considerable value in the selection of patients in whom there is a need for further diagnostic studies.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of aerosol pentamidine-induced bronchoconstriction, its relationship to non-specific airway responsiveness, and its response to preventive therapy using salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, or sodium cromoglycate. METHODS: Consecutive HIV-infected individuals starting prophylactic AP were eligible if they had not been previously treated with this agent. Simple spirometry was performed before and 10 min after a single 60-mg dose given through an ultrasonic nebulizer. Methacholine challenge was performed in all subjects 24 h to four days after the initial AP dose. Subjects with a change in FEV1 (delta FEV1) greater than or equal to 10 percent decrease after the initial AP dose were restudied on three separate occasions (greater than 24 hours apart) after premedication with two puffs of salbutamol (200 micrograms), ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms), or sodium cromoglycate (2 mg), in random order. RESULTS: Fifty-three subjects were studied. The median delta FEV1 after a single dose of AP was -7.0 percent (range: -47 percent, 1.8 percent). The delta FEV1 following AP was only partially predicted by the degree of nonspecific bronchial responsiveness as measured by a standard methacholine challenge. Age, current smoking, history of asthma, baseline FEV1, or a prior episode of PCP failed to predict the delta FEV1 following AP. Eighteen subjects (34 percent) had a delta FEV1 greater than or equal to 10 percent decrease (median: -17.0 percent). In these subjects, after premedication with salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, and sodium cromoglycate, the median delta FEV1 was 1.0, 0.8, and -9.6 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Aerosol pentamidine produced a decrease in FEV1 greater than or equal to 10 percent in 34 percent of subjects. This was not accurately predicted by the methacholine response. The bronchoconstriction induced by AP was effectively prevented by either salbutamol or ipratropium, whereas cromoglycate was only partially effective.\r"

Bronchial abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis were found in 31 of 54 cases. Separate or coexistent findings at initial FB included airway compression (20 cases), granulation tissue (ten cases), and obstructive caseum (four cases). Chest roentgenograms underestimated bronchial involvement in 14 children. Further FB monitoring documented disease evolution. The FB was important in the management of patients, as it (1) guided the use of prednisone therapy, especially in the children with a chest roentgenogram not suggestive of bronchial involvement; (2) indicated a need for resection of granulation tissue by rigid bronchoscopy (three cases); and (3) guided the surgical decision (two children with persistent bronchial obstruction). Thus, FB is a safe and valuable procedure in the management of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

The CO2 recruitment threshold (CO2RT) was compared with the arterial CO2 tension during unassisted breathing (CO2SB) and with the PaCO2 during mechanical ventilation (CO2MV) at machine settings determined by the primary physician. Based on these comparisons, we tested the hypotheses that (1) patients without weaning-induced respiratory distress (group 1) maintain CO2SB near CO2RT, (2) patients with weaning-induced respiratory distress (group 2) retain CO2SB above CO2RT, thereby manifesting incomplete load compensation, and (3) CO2MV is ventilator setting dependent and provides insufficient information about the ventilatory requirement during weaning. Respiratory distress was prospectively defined as sustained tachypnea (rate greater than or equal to 30) or intense dyspnea (Borg scale rating) and limited weaning in nine of 14 patients. The average CO2RT was 40 mm Hg in both groups. All patients in group 1 maintained CO2SB near CO2RT (p greater than 0.1). Seven of nine patients in group 2 retained CO2 by greater than or equal to 3 mm Hg above CO2RT (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between CO2MV and CO2SB in either group. We conclude that CO2RT provides a better reference of the adequacy of ventilatory load compensation during weather than CO2MV.\r"

The major diagnostic challenge was in differentiating primary cardiopulmonary disease from a central abnormality of ventilatory drive. The arterial blood gases showed a normal A-a gradient suggesting hypoventilation as the etiology of his hypoxemia. Pulmonary function testing showed air trapping, but a relatively normal FEV1/FVC and airways resistance. The literature suggests that most altitude natives have depressed hypoxemic and hypercapnic drives with a distinct subset demonstrating a profoundly depressed drive to ventilation. This latter group has been labeled as having chronic mountain sickness or Monge's disease. As one might expect, ventilatory control during sleep is also abnormal in these patients with CMS. Our patient indeed showed typical frequent severe desaturations with hypopnea. The diagnosis of CMS in our patient was made with routine arterial blood gases and standard pulmonary function tests. Additional tests of ventilatory responsiveness to oxygen and carbon dioxide could have been performed, but are not necessary to make the diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "91365171\r", 
  ".W": "In 11 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and deteriorating renal function, the effect of the vasoconstrictor substance 8-ornithin vasopressin (ornipressin; POR 8; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) on renal function, hemodynamic parameters, and humoral mediators was studied. Ornipressin was infused at a dose of 6 IU/h over a period of 4 hours. During ornipressin infusion an improvement of renal function was achieved as indicated by significant increases in inulin clearance (+65%), paraaminohippuric acid clearance (+49%), urine volume (+45%), sodium excretion (+259%), and fractional elimination of sodium (+130%). The hyperdynamic circulation was reversed to a nearly normal circulatory state. The increase in systemic vascular resistance (+60%) coincided with a decrease of a previously elevated renal vascular resistance (-27%) and increase in renal blood flow (+44%). The renal fraction of the cardiac output increased from 2.3% to 4.7% (P less than 0.05). A decline of the elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline (2.08-1.13 ng/mL; P less than 0.01) and renin activity (27.6-14.2 ng.mL-1.h-1; P less than 0.01) was achieved. The plasma concentration of the atrial natriuretic factor increased in most of the patients, but slightly decreased in 3 patients. The decrease of renal vascular resistance and the increase of renal blood flow and of the renal fraction of cardiac output play a key role in the beneficial effect of ornipressin on renal failure. These changes develop by an increase in mean arterial pressure, the reduction of the sympathetic activity, and probably of an extenuation of the splanchnic vasodilation. A significant contribution of atrial natriuretic factor is less likely. The present findings implicate that treatment with ornipressin represents an alternative approach to the management of functional renal failure in advanced liver cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effect of enteral nutrition as the sole therapy of active Crohn's disease with drug treatment. Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11]. Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41 patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2 test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However, no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in treating active Crohn's disease.\r"

It has been hypothesized that this compound, through inhibition of the Na(+)-K+ pump, can constrict blood vessels, enhance vasoconstriction in response to agonists, increase cardiac contractility, raise blood pressure, and cause natriuresis/diuresis and therefore is implicated in the pathophysiology of the low-renin, volume-expanded type of hypertension. However, so far, only two steroid Na(+)-K+ pump inhibitors (namely, a bufodienolide derivative [resibufogenin], obtained from toad skin and plasma and a factor with the same carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen content as ouabain obtained from the plasma of volume-expanded humans) have been purified and structurally characterized. To determine whether such endogenous Na(+)-K+ pump inhibitors can in fact produce the above effects on the cardiovascular and renal systems, we infused commercially available bufalin (aglycone, identical to resibufogenin except for one H+), ouabain, and ouabagenin (aglycone) at equimolar doses in normotensive rats. Relative to ouabain, bufalin produced significantly greater dose-dependent increases in blood pressure, left ventricular rate of pressure change, heart rate, and excretion of urinary volume and sodium. Ouabagenin was without effect on any of these parameters. These data indicate that a Na(+)-K+ pump inhibitor can cause an increase in blood pressure despite potent diuretic and natriuretic effects and that, in rats, bufalin is much more potent in this respect than ouabain or ouabagenin.\r"

The cardiac output was measured by thermodilution method. It was found that 4 weeks of simulated 18,000-foot hypoxia led to polycythemia, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary hypertension, which resulted from an increased pulmonary vascular resistance. However, systemic arterial pressure was not significantly different between the two groups of rats. Atrial natriuretic factor administration decreased systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure to a lesser extent in the hypoxic group compared with the sea level control group. It is concluded that these animals showed an impaired response to atrial natriuretic factor after long-term exposure to hypoxia.\r"

Treatment of very mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 90-94 mm Hg), even if the benefits do exceed the risks, does not appear to be particularly cost-effective. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of hypertension management lie in 1) avoidance of patient mislabeling by careful documentation of blood pressures on multiple occasions in the office and during usual activities outside the office before the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun; 2) efforts to increase adherence to scheduled visits and medication regimens; 3) attempts to step-down dosages or discontinue medications after periods of good blood pressure control; 4) explicit consideration of costs, as well as benefits, in decisions on the needed frequency of office visits, choice of medications, and use of laboratory tests; and 5) efforts to improve practice efficiency. Future practice guidelines for hypertension management should take these factors into account and should make trade-offs between benefits, risks, and costs explicit for specific types of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension results from abnormalities of the control systems that normally regulate blood pressure. These control systems include vascular, cardiogenic, renal, neurogenic, and endocrine mechanisms that interact in a complex but integrated manner to achieve blood pressure homeostasis. Multiple endogenous biologically active substances participate in the regulation of these control systems. Evidence suggests that abnormalities of these regulatory mechanisms resulting from altered genetic and environmental interactions play an important role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension. Once hypertension develops, it tends to be self-perpetuating via amplifying mechanisms mediated by secondary structural changes in the blood vessels, heart, and kidney. These adaptative structural changes amplify and perpetuate hypertension by increasing systemic vascular resistance, enhancing cardiac output, and impairing renal sodium and water excretion. The long-term sequelae of hypertensive structural changes in these end organs are complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, stroke, and renal failure. With the tools of molecular biology, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities has increased enormously and continues to grow at a rapid pace, as illustrated by the discussion that follows. Our review of the molecular biology of hypertension will address systematically four key areas: 1) molecular biology of the control systems, 2) molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular structural changes, 3) genetics of hypertension, and 4) application of transgenic technology in studies of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To assess further the relationship between gonadal sex steroids and PRL, GH, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion and to help clarify the mechanism underlying the pubertal growth spurt, we studied 11 children (10 girls) with central precocious puberty before and during gonadal suppression with the GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) leuprolide acetate. Nocturnal sampling for plasma levels of GH and PRL, GH response to GH-releasing factor-(1-44), and plasma IGF-I levels were determined before and 3-6 months after pituitary-gonadal suppression. Treatment caused a significant decrease in the LH and FSH responses to GnRH (P less than 0.01) and the plasma concentration of estradiol (P less than 0.05). The patients' mean height velocity SD score for chronological age, initially 3.8 +/- 1.9, decreased significantly to 0.9 +/- 0.9 with treatment (P less than 0.005). Nocturnal GH secretion (mean GH concentration, sum of GH pulse areas, sum of GH pulse amplitudes, and GH pulse frequency) and mean IGF-I levels (1.38 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.72 +/- 0.34 U/mL) were not significantly altered by treatment. However, the mean peak GH response to GH-releasing factor-(1-44) was 29.2 +/- 6.8 micrograms/L before treatment and declined significantly to 17.7 +/- 3.4 micrograms/L after gonadal suppression (P less than 0.05). PRL secretion was similar before and after GnRH-a-induced suppression. These results indicate that the decrease in height velocity noted during GnRH-a treatment occurred independently of changes in nocturnal GH secretion and IGF-I levels. These data are consistent with the premise that sex steroids can modulate growth by a direct action on skeletal growth.\r"

  ".U": "91365832\r", 
  ".W": "In children a progressive decrease in nocturnal serum melatonin (MT) has been shown with advancing age, suggesting a reduction in the amplitude of the circadian MT curve with maturation. Whether this alteration of MT levels is related to human sexual maturation or occurs independently remains to be elucidated. Also, the impact of gonadal steroids on the MT rhythm remains an open question. We examined 56 patients (51 females and 5 males) with central precocious puberty (52 idiopathic and 4 neurogenic). Patients were studied before and 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of GnRH analog treatment. Three hundred and thirty-seven endocrinologically normal subjects (190 males and 147 females) served as controls. In all subjects nocturnal serum MT (blood collection between 2300 and 0100 h) was measured with a highly specific RIA. In young patients, aged 1-5 yr, we found significantly lower MT levels than in age-matched controls. Pubertal patients, aged 5-9 yr, displayed nocturnal MT levels in the same range as control subjects approaching normal pubertal age. In contrast to endocrinologically normal children, there was no age-dependent decrease in nocturnal MT in untreated precocious puberty; rather, it appeared that serum MT had already declined in association with the onset of sexual maturation. Although there was a significant difference in weight between patients and age-matched controls, the low MT values in patients 1-5 yr old were only partly explained by the weight difference (P less than 0.0009); their pubertal status also contributed significantly (P less than 0.006). Pituitary-gonadal suppression induced by long term GnRH analog treatment did not result in a return to prepubertal MT levels; rather, nocturnal MT decreased during therapy. The collected data indicate that nocturnal serum MT levels are related to sexual maturation, since serum MT is similar in precocious puberty and normal pubertal children. Since suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis did not result in increases in nocturnal MT levels in young patients with precocity (i.e. return to age-appropriate levels), the reduction of nocturnal MT with normal puberty is not likely to be dependent on pubertal gonadotropin or sex steroid milieu.\r"

To further assess this phenomenon we measured serial serum P4, LH, and estradiol levels in 115 consecutive patients undergoing stimulation for IVF/ET with midluteal leuprolide acetate and human menopausal gonadotropins. IVF/ET cycle outcome was retrospectively correlated with P4 levels on the day of hCG administration. Two critical breakpoints were identified, 1.27 nmol/L (0.4 ng/mL) and 286 nmol/L (0.9 ng/mL). Clinical pregnancies occurred in 9 of 18 patients in group I (P4, less than 1.27 nmol/L) compared to 11 of 81 patients in group II (1.27 less than P4 less than 2.86 nmol/L; P = 0.001) and 0 of 14 patients in group III (P4, less than or equal to 2.86 nmol/L) (P = 0.001). Eleven patients in group III had cryopreservation of embryos during that cycle. Six subsequently underwent frozen embryo transfer, and clinical pregnancies occurred in 2, both of whom have delivered. These findings demonstrate that even modest increases in serum P4 levels (greater than 1.27 nmol/L) are associated with reduced pregnancy rates in IVF/ET cycles. In addition, it appears that the mechanism may not exclusively involve poor oocyte quality.\r"

  ".W": "Serum steroid, gonadotropin, and alpha-subunit levels were assessed in 35 women with cycle abnormalities [11 with and 24 without polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) according to strict clinical and biochemical criteria] and 8 regularly cycling women in the early (cycle day 3 or 4) and mid (cycle day 7 or 8) follicular phase. LH and FSH levels were estimated using two immunological techniques [RIA and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)] and in vitro bioassays (BIO), using mouse Leydig cells and rat granulosa cells, respectively. In PCOD patients mean alpha-subunit, free androgen index [FAI; testosterone x 100/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol (E2) were significantly elevated compared to levels in the early follicular phase of control cycles and non-PCOD patients. In addition, in PCOD patients mean IRMA-LH and RIA-LH levels were distinctly increased (2.8- to 3.6 fold, respectively; both comparisons, P less than 0.001) compared to control values, but in the same order of magnitude (1.3- to 1.4-fold increments) as that in non-PCOD patients. However, the median BIO-LH level in PCOD patients was 5.9-fold higher than that in non-PCOD patients and 4.0-fold higher than the BIO-LH in the early follicular phase of control women. Consequently, the median BIO/IRMA-LH ratio was 4.8-fold higher in PCOD patients compared to non-PCOD patients. In women with cycle abnormalities, individual BIO/IRMA-LH ratios correlated with BIO-LH (rs = 0.48), FAI (rs = 0.39), free estrogens (E2/SHBG ratios; rs = 0 0.47), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (rs = 0.60) concentrations. Mean IRMA-, RIA-, and BIO-FSH levels and BIO/IRMA-FSH ratios were not significantly different when various groups were compared. Although RIA- and IRMA-LH levels showed good correlation (rs = 0.88), RIA-LH levels were consistently higher, resulting in distinctly higher RIA-LH/FSH ratios (mean, 4.5) compared to IRMA-LH/FSH ratios (median, 1.8) in PCOD patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Serum FSH concentrations were determined by RIA, immunoradiometric assay, and an in vitro FSH bioassay (rat Sertoli cell). At steady state, the MCR of FSH averaged 5.4 +/- 0.4 mL/min.m2, which was not statistically different in the three assays at the three different infusion rates. The half-life of FSH after bolus injection averaged 274 +/- 45 min (4.6 +/- 0.75 h) when analyzed as a single exponential, and 1.8 and 10 h for biexponential kinetics. The distribution volume of FSH was 3.1 L (immunoradiometric assay) and 2.1 L (bioassay). In summary, the MCR of human FSH is invariant across a range of physiological gonadotropin concentrations and quantitatively similar in three different immunological/biological assays. These results support the hypothesis that removal of circulating FSH molecules proceeds in parallel for immunoreactive and biologically active glycoprotein hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Marked changes in maternal thyroid activity occur in pregnancy. It has been suggested that hCG may stimulate maternal T4 secretion, given its in vitro thyrotropic activity ascribed to a significant degree of structural homology with TSH. In a longitudinal study of 32 normal pregnant women, we attempted to clarify the functional activity of the thyroid in early and late pregnancy and the possibility of a nonpituitary control on the thyroid. Total T4 and T4-binding globulin levels were increased from the first trimester onward. Free T4 levels did not differ in the first trimester from postpartum values, but were significantly decreased in second and third trimesters (P less than 0.001). A decrease in TSH levels was observed in the first trimester (0.72 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.12 mU/L; P less than 0.001), while second and third trimester values did not differ from those postpartum. A significant negative correlation (P less than 0.05) was observed between hCG and TSH levels in the earliest weeks (8-10) of the first trimester. No correlation was found between hCG and total T4 or free T4 levels. A stimulation of I- uptake in FRTL-5 cells was induced by first trimester serum, which also showed a different behavior at chromatofocusing, with a higher proportion of hCG eluting at acidic pIs compared to second trimester samples. However, neither hCG levels nor the amount of acidic hCG correlated with the thyroid-stimulating activity measured in vitro. Some correlation was found with the percentage of basic hCG (eluting at pI greater than 4.6), although these isoforms were equally present in first and second trimesters. The differing patterns of circulating hCG at various stages of gestation suggest that distinct hCG isoforms may regulate maternal thyroid activity.\r"

  ".W": "Subnormal free T4 index (FT4I) values (less than 80) with inappropriately normal serum TSH concentrations that could not be attributed to illness or drugs were found in 2.5% of ambulating elderly clinic patients. Six such individuals (three men and three women, aged 68.8 +/- 4.8 yr) were selected for their persistent thyroid test abnormalities and were sex and age matched to six subjects (67.7 +/- 4.9 yr) with normal FT4I (greater than 90) and TSH levels. The former also had low serum total T4 (TT4) and rT3 (TrT3) concentrations, but total T3 (TT3) and basal TSH values were normal and did not differ between the groups. Responses of ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH, and PRL to stimulation with CRH, GnRH, and TRH showed no differences between the two groups, indicating that the normal TSH concentration, inappropriate for the low FT4I level, is not due to generalized hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. Administration of 3 g iopanoic acid (IOP) daily for 3 days produced significant increases in the TT4 and TrT3 concentrations to the same degree in both groups. Also, in both groups the IOP-induced suppression of T4 to T3 conversion in the pituitary gland provoked similar increases in basal TSH (280 +/- 47% and 288 +/- 33%) and TSH secretion in response to TRH (173 +/- 7% and 156 +/- 13%). These results indicate that the low FT4I is not the consequence of reduced pituitary TSH reserve. In addition, evidence for normal thyroid gland reserve and the secretion of TSH of normal biological activity was obtained by comparing the acute iodothyronine responses to TRH-induced TSH release in both groups. It is concluded that the normal serum TSH concentration, inappropriate for the low FT4I value in some elderly subjects, is due to an apparent resetting of the thyroid hormone feedback regulation threshold of TSH secretion. It may, in turn, be the result of enhanced pituitary conversion of T4 to T3 or increased T4 uptake by the thyrotrophs.\r"

  ".U": "91365849\r", 
  ".W": "Long-acting preparations of LHRH (LHRHa), such as leuprolide acetate, have been shown to selectively and reversibly suppress the clinical and biochemical features of central precocious puberty (CPP). The withdrawal of gonadal sex steroids results in a decline of growth velocity and a decrease in the rate of bone age maturation, with resultant improvement in predicted adult stature. The purpose of this study was to define GH secretory dynamics in children treated with leuprolide acetate. Twelve-hour nocturnal GH studies were performed in five children (four girls and one boy) with CPP before and after 6 months of treatment with leuprolide acetate. Mean GH levels, GH secretory rate, and number of GH secretory episodes were determined. Secretory profiles were analyzed using the Cluster program. Growth velocity, somatomedin-C, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured before and after 6 months of therapy. By 6 months of therapy, there was a significant decrease in mean growth velocity from 10.5 +/- 3.3 to 6.7 +/- 1.6 cm/yr. Somatomedin-C levels remained the same at 46.90 +/- 9.51 and 52.5 +/- 12.40 nmol/L. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate remained unchanged at 118.6 +/- 71.4 and 139.0 +/- 61.3 mumol/L at 0 and 6 months of the study. By 6 months, there was a significant decrease in mean GH levels from 13.6 +/- 5.3 to 6.4 +/- 3.4 micrograms/L (P less than 0.05). Total GH levels decreased from 1367.9 +/- 687.3 to 447.0 +/- 186.5 ng/12 h. The number of GH secretory episodes remained the same at 5.4 +/- 1.5 and 4.8 +/- 1.0/12 h at 0 and 6 months of study. Therefore, the decrease in GH that occurs during the withdrawal of gonadal sex steroids with LHRHa in children with CPP is an amplitude-modulated phenomenon, as the number of secretory peaks remains unchanged.\r"

TRH, GnRH, and arginine vasopressin induced a marked [Ca2+]i rise in 10/12, 4/12, and 2/5 tumors, respectively. The transients induced by these peptides were due to both Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. AC activity was evaluated in 10 adenomas; 1 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide induced a 2- to 6-fold stimulation of the enzyme activity in all tumors, while neither GHRH nor CRH were effective. Moreover, in 5/10 tumors 1 microM SRIH reduced both AC activity and [Ca2+]i, while in 2/10 the peptide caused a significant rise in [Ca2+]i despite the AC inhibition and in 3/10 SRIH did not modify either AC activity or [Ca2+]i. This study indicates that in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas a wide spectrum of hypothalamic peptides modulate [Ca2+]i and AC activity. Moreover, the presence of biologically active receptors may offer a possible target for therapeutic intervention.\r"

Sera from 53 patients with various connective tissue disorders were examined for the presence of antibodies to nuclear antigens (ANA), double stranded DNA (dsDNA), Sm, RNP, SSA/Ro, and SSB/La. Of the 53 patients, 42 were ANA positive, 11 were ANA negative, and 22 had antibodies to dsDNA. Seven patients had antibodies to Sm by haemagglutination assay; these were also positive in both ELISA systems (only five of the seven patients were assayed by the Lipogen ELISA system). Two additional Sm positive values were obtained in each of the ELISA systems but only one of these was positive in both. Ten positive RNP results were obtained by haemagglutination and nine of these were also positive by the Diamedix ELISA. Only eight samples were tested by the Lipogen assay and seven of these were positive. Three additional RNP positive values were obtained by the Diamedix and six by the Lipogen ELISA assays. Of these, only two were positive in both. Antibodies to SSA/Ro were obtained in 11 patients by immunodiffusion and lines of partial identity were observed in nine. SSB/La antibodies were positive in six patients and two had lines of partial identity. All the SSA/Ro and SSB/La positive sera were also positive in both ELISA systems. Moreover, eight additional SSA/Ro positive values were obtained in each of the ELISAs, four of which had partial identity lines in the immunodiffusion assay. Furthermore, three additional SSB/La positive values were obtained by the Diamedix and four by the Lipogen assays. Of these, only two were positive in both ELISAs. This study shows that the above ELISAs are comparable in specificity and sensitivity with haemagglutination assay for detection of antibodies to Sm and RNP antigens and are more sensitive than immunodiffusion for the detection of SSA/Ro and SSB/La antigens.\r"

Hourly blood samples were obtained for 24 hr from 7 young (age 25-35 yr) and 7 elderly (age 65-72 yr) healthy men. Serum inhibin and testosterone levels were measured by RIA. Similar to T, serum inhibin levels demonstrated a circadian pattern in young men. Elderly men also demonstrated a circadian rhythm in serum inhibin, with an average amplitude that was not significantly different from that found in young men, despite the fact that the average 24-hr inhibin level in the elderly men was significantly lower than in the young men. These results demonstrate that immunoreactive inhibin, like T, displays a circadian rhythm in the serum of adult men and the inhibin biorhythm is maintained in elderly men.\r"

Injection of C57BL/6 spleen cells into B6D2F1 recipients results in the acute form of GVHD whereas injection of DBA/2J cells into the same recipients results in a chronic form of GVHD. In vivo studies have suggested that injection of DBA/2J cells into B6D2F1 recipients results in the chronic form of GVHD instead of acute GVHD because of recipient B6D2F1 effector cells that inhibit DBA/2J CD8+ T cell function. The present report describes the development of an in vitro assay that measures the activity of these B6D2F1 effector cells. The results obtained using this assay indicate that these B6D2F1 effector cells are found primarily in the LN, need to be activated in order to function, are inhibited by anti-CD8 antibodies, and mediate their function as a result of DBA/2J cells binding to Ag expressed on their cell surface.\r"

CD4+8+ IEL (double positives; DP) could be detected in significant numbers in preparations from several mouse strains. DP IEL expressed Tcr alpha, beta and Thy1. Comparison of Tcr alpha, beta levels of thymocytes and IEL revealed that whereas the majority of DP thymocytes expressed low Tcr levels, DP IEL expressed high, mature T cell levels of Tcr. In addition, DP IEL were generally Ly3- (CD8 beta), unlike their thymic counterparts, which are Ly3+. Ly3 was not present on Tcr gamma, delta IEL, whereas CD4-8+ Tcr alpha, beta IEL contained Ly3- and Ly3+ subsets. The Ly3- population in either Tcr-bearing subset could be further subdivided by Thy1 expression. Ly1 (CD5) expression was also examined, and none of the Tcr gamma, delta IEL were Ly1+. Based on Thy1, Ly3, and Ly1 expression, four CD4-8+ Tcr alpha, beta IEL subsets were detected. The results indicate the cellular complexity of the IEL compartment rivals that found in the thymus. These findings are discussed in light of recent data suggesting an extrathymic origin of some IEL.\r"

  ".W": "To understand mechanisms of signal transduction involved in the regulation of isotype differentiation of B lymphocytes, we investigated effects of activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters and elevation of intracellular free calcium (Ca2+) by the calcium ionophore ionomycin (Ion) on Ig secretion by mouse Peyer's patch (PP) and spleen B cells. Results show that Ion suppressed production of IgM, IgG, and IgA by LPS-stimulated B cells whereas PKC-activating phorbol esters also inhibited LPS-induced IgM and IgG secretion, but induced a substantial IgA synthesis, as well as alpha-chain mRNA transcription, in B cells whether stimulated or not by LPS. Phorbol esters enhanced IgA response by directly activating PKC, inasmuch as the other phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which is inactive with respect to PKC, had no effect on B cell differentiation. The increase in IgA secretion occurred in whole PP B cells, but not in the membrane IgA- B cell subset, suggesting that PKC activation does not promote the switching rate of IgM+ cells to IgA+ cells. Results from double staining studies of mIgA using FITC-labeled anti-IgA antibodies and DNA content using the DNA-binding propidium iodide showed that enhanced IgA response was not caused by IgA B cell clonal expansion. PMA induced low level of IL-6 production by highly purified PP B cells. However, addition of anti-mouse IL-6 antibody did not prevent PMA-enhanced IgA secretion, suggesting that IL-6 was not responsible for IgA induction by PMA. Collectively, the present data demonstrate that PKC activation and Ca2+ mobilization, which synergistically trigger cell proliferation, have differential effects on B cell isotype differentiation. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ suppresses Ig production, but activation of PKC selectively enhances IgA secretion by directly promoting terminal differentiation of IgA-committed PP B cells into IgA-secreting plasma cells.\r"

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:5583, 1983). In the course of examining macrophage fusion factors (MFF) present in Con A-CM, we found that IL-4 induced fusion of alveolar macrophages with a time course similar to that induced by Con A-CM. However, the maximal fusion rate induced by IL-4 (4 ng/ml) was about 35%. Furthermore, the fusion induced by Con A-CM was blocked only partially by adding IL-4 antibody, indicating that there are unknown MFF other than in Con A-CM. Of several other cytokines produced by Con A-stimulated spleen cells, IL-6 (20 ng/ml), IFN-gamma (45 ng/ml) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF (10 ng/ml) greatly potentiated the fusion induced by 4 ng/ml of IL-4. The assay of these cytokines in Con A-CM proved that it contained 0.44 +/- 0.04 ng/ml of IL-4, 1.0 +/- 0.24 ng/ml of IL-6, 9.1 +/- 0.07 ng/ml of IFN-gamma, and 11.6 +/- 1.66 ng/ml of GM-CSF. When the potentiating effects of IL-6, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF on macrophage fusion were examined in the presence of 0.4 ng/ml of IL-4, only GM-CSF increased the fusion rate to the maximal level induced by Con A-CM at its physiologic concentration (10 ng/ml). The macrophage fusion induced by Con A-CM was greatly suppressed by adding antibody against GM-CSF. GM-CSF had a biphasic effect on growth and fusion, depending on its dose levels used: 0.01 to 0.1 ng/ml increased proliferation without inducing fusion and 10 ng/ml preferentially induced fusion. There was a negative relationship between macrophage growth and fusion. IL-4 was a potent inhibitor of proliferation of macrophages induced by GM-CSF. These results clearly indicate that GM-CSF is a major MFF present in Con A-CM.\r"

  ".W": "IFN-gamma primes murine macrophages to render them responsive for triggering by subactivating concentrations of bacterial LPS to mediate nonspecific tumor cytotoxicity. However, IFN-gamma also has direct anti-proliferative effects on transformed cells that serve as sensitive tumor targets for cytotoxic macrophages. We investigated the effects of preexposure of L1210 mouse leukemia and P815 mouse mastocytoma targets to rIFN-gamma on changes in their susceptibility to cytotoxicity by LPS-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages (PM). Co-incubation of inflammatory PM and either L1210 or P815 targets with IFN-gamma and LPS produced a classical synergistic cytotoxicity for both targets over that of IFN-gamma or LPS alone. Similar synergistic augmentation of cytotoxicity occurred when effector PM were preprimed for 24 h with IFN-gamma before testing for cytotoxicity of untreated targets. However, pretreatment of L1210 and P815 targets for 24 h with IFN-gamma (50 U) before assay produced divergent results in that L1210 was more susceptible, whereas P815 was less susceptible to cytotoxicity by LPS-activated macrophages. Similar results were obtained when both macrophages and targets were pretreated separately with IFN-gamma for 24 h before their combined assay for tumor cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of L1210 targets for 1, 4, or 24 h with IFN-gamma produced similar effects on their increased susceptibility to macrophage cytotoxicity. In contrast, P815 pretreated for 1 and 4 h with IFN-gamma showed an early increased susceptibility to macrophage cytotoxicity followed by a decrease after 24 h pretreatment. The pretreatment of L1210 or P815 targets with IFN-gamma before their exposure to LPS-activated macrophages had no effect on the production of TNF. However, there was a corresponding increase in nitric oxide generation by LPS-activated macrophages after their exposure to IFN-gamma pretreated L1210 targets and a decrease in the presence of IFN-gamma-pretreated P815 targets that correlated with their changes in susceptibility to macrophage killing. Nitric oxide generation by macrophages alone in response to LPS was found to be greater than when effector macrophages were exposed to the tumor targets and this was either increased by L1210 or decreased by P815 that had been pretreated with IFN-gamma. Our results indicate that IFN-gamma may act directly and differentially on tumor targets to alter their susceptibility for macrophage cytotoxicity, which was coupled to changes in the generation of cytotoxic nitric oxide, rather than TNF production by the macrophage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is found on the surface of many hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells and can function as an adhesive ligand for the integrin, leukocyte function associated molecule-1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18). ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction is thought to be of importance in many immune mediated cell-cell adhesion reactions. Recently, the major human rhinovirus (HRV) receptor has been identified as ICAM-1. HRV has been shown to bind specifically to ICAM-1 on transfected COS cells and to purified ICAM-1, which has been adsorbed to plastic microtiter wells. We have compared the ability of ICAM-1 expressed on the surface of human fibroblasts (FB) to function as a receptor for HRV as well as a receptor for LFA-1-bearing human T lymphocytes. We show that FB stimulation by the cytokines IFN-gamma or IL-1, both known inducers of ICAM-1 synthesis and expression in FB, induced an increase in HRV binding to treated cells, which could be inhibited by antibody to ICAM-1. In contrast, only IFN-gamma and not IL-1 treatment of FB resulted in an increased adhesion of T lymphocytes. Binding of HRV to IFN-gamma-treated FB inhibited the subsequent adhesion of T cells. We also show that prior stimulation of FB with IL-1 enhanced the adhesion of HRV to IFN-gamma-stimulated cells, although IL-1 pretreatment was inhibitory for T cell adhesion. As these two cytokines both up-regulate ICAM-1 on the surface of human FB, the contrasting effects of IFN-gamma and IL-1 on human FB ICAM-1 adhesion to HRV and to LFA-1 suggest that qualitative as well as quantitative alterations of the ICAM-1 molecule may contribute to its specificity of ligand recognition.\r"

  ".W": "Human monoblastic/monocytic leukemia cell lines U937, THP-1, Mono-Mac-6, and blood monocytes were incubated with various concentrations of human rIL-6 and other cytokines and analyzed for their capacity to bind several anti-Fc epsilon RII/CD23 mAb. A marked and dose-dependent increase in the percentage of CD23+ cells, as well as in the mean channel fluorescence intensity, as demonstrated by FACS analysis, was noted after 8- to 72-h incubation of U937 cells with 1 to 1000 U/ml of human rIL-6. Furthermore, rIL-4 synergized with rIL-6 and rIFN-tau in augmenting the Fc epsilon RII expression on U937 cells, whereas rIFN-tau and rIL-6 showed rather additive effects. The enhancement of CD23 expression on IL-6-treated U937 cells was blocked by anti-IL-6 antibodies. Northern blot analysis, employing cDNA probes for Fc epsilon RII, showed that U937 cells contain Fc epsilon RII-specific mRNA. The level of Fc epsilon RII-encoding mRNA was evidently increased by treatment of U937 cells with human rIL-6, rIL-4, or with rIL-6 + rIL-4. The expression of CD23 on THP-1 and Mono-Mac-6 cells was increased slightly by rIL-6 and markedly by rIL-4, rIFN-tau, or a mixture of them. Approximately 14% of blood monocytes, isolated from apparently healthy donors, constitutively possess Fc epsilon RII. In contrast to the cell lines, the Fc epsilon RII density and the percentage of blood monocytes bearing Fc epsilon RII was not augmented by IL-6. Furthermore, rIL-6, and more evidently rIFN-tau, down-regulate rIL-4-driven Fc epsilon RII expression on monocytes but not on monocytic cell lines. Our findings point to differences in the capability of mononuclear phagocytes to respond to cytokine treatment, which may be differentiation dependent, and suggest separate regulatory pathways.\r"

Nonopsonizing antibody to the bacterial capsule, mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP), appears at elevated titers during chronic colonization of cystic fibrosis patients, as do opsonins not specific for MEP. Nonopsonic antibodies to MEP occur naturally in most adults and can be induced in animals by immunization. A limited number of humans produce MEP-specific opsonic antibodies after immunization. The purpose of this study was to compare the activation and deposition of C components onto the bacterial surface in the presence of these different antibodies. Opsonic killing uses the classical C pathway. MEP-specific opsonic and nonopsonic antibodies bound to whole bacteria and activated C to a comparable degree, but opsonic antibody deposited 3 to 40 times more C3 onto bacteria, mostly as C3bi, compared to nonopsonic antibody. In addition, two to three times as much nonopsonic mAb as opsonic mAb (both IgG2b) bound to the bacteria at comparable input concentrations, indicating the difference in C deposition was not due to differences in antibody binding. Non-MEP-specific opsonins also bound C3 to the bacteria, but only a mean of 27 +/- 14% was ester linked, compared with 81 +/- 11% of C3 deposited by MEP-specific opsonins. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that two-thirds of the C3 bound in the presence of MEP-specific opsonins was linked to MEP, whereas non-MEP-specific opsonins obtained from infected patients deposited the C3 onto LPS and other unidentified Ag. These data show that MEP-specific opsonins function by depositing C3 onto the outer bacterial surface that differentiates them from non-MEP-specific opsonins produced in response to chronic infection.\r"

The Fab site that binds to SPA has been localized to the V region of the Ig H chain. In a previous study of human monoclonal and polyclonal IgM, we demonstrated that binding to SPA was highly restricted to molecules of the VHIII subgroup, and that nearly all VHIII IgM were able to bind SPA. The present study examines the VH composition of SPA-binding and SPA-nonbinding fractions of purified human polyclonal IgA, and IgG F(ab')2 fragments. We found that 22% of the IgA and 15% of the IgG F(ab')2 bound to SPA-agarose. Analysis with VH subgroup-specific antisera indicated that the SPA-binding fraction of IgA was dominated by the VHIII subgroup, and the SPA-binding fraction of IgG F(ab')2 contained only VHIII molecules. Furthermore, substantial portions of the total VHIII protein in IgA and in IgG F(ab')2 bound to SPA. We conclude that Fab binding to SPA is both restricted to and highly prevalent among human VHIII molecules, regardless of Ig class. These results suggest that protein A is an Ig superantigen.\r"

R7 LPS. In the presence of serum, intact LPS from enterobacterial and nonenterobacterial strains bound to monocytes in a dose-dependent, saturable, and displaceable fashion. N.m. LPS and LPS from the enterobacterial strain of Escherichia coli 0111-B4 bound to the same sites on monocytes as assessed in competitive binding experiments. Specific binding of intact LPS to monocytes occurred through the CD14 molecule as shown by the ability of mAb and of F(ab')2 fragments of mAb directed against specific epitopes of CD14 to inhibit the binding of [3H]-LPS to cells and by the lack of binding of intact LPS to CD14-deficient cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Specific binding of LPS to monocytes was not mediated by the CD11/CD18 complex because mAb to the alpha and beta chains of the Leu-CAM molecules did not alter the binding of LPS to cells and because LPS did not inhibit the binding of labeled mAb to monocytes. [3H]-PS-OMe also bound in a dose-dependent and displaceable fashion to monocytes involving an unidentified, non-CD14, binding site on the cells. Binding of LPS to monocytes also involved nonsaturable binding sites for hydrophobic structures of LPS as evidenced in binding experiments performed in the absence of serum. These observations indicate that intact LPS may interact with the monocyte membrane in at least three ways including serum-dependent binding to CD14 and to a lectin-like receptor, and serum-independent hydrophobic interactions.\r"

  ".U": "91366145\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms of granule protein secretion have been studied in streptolysin-O-permeabilized guinea pig eosinophils. Secretion of the granule-associated enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was dependent on both Ca2+ and a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), suggesting roles for both calcium and GTP binding proteins. Secretion was maximal by 7 min, and varied between 35 and 60% of the total enzyme activity. Other GTP analogues also elicited secretion, with rank order GTP-gamma-S greater than guanylyl-imidophosphate greater than guanylyl (beta-gamma-methylene-diphosphate). Unrelated nucleotide triphosphates showed little or no effect confirming the specificity of the G protein. Transmission electronmicroscopy confirmed that permeabilization alone did not result in loss of granules and that exocytosis was dependent on the addition of the effectors, Ca2+ and GTP-gamma-S. ATP enhanced the magnitude of the secretory response and also enhanced the effective affinities for both Ca2+ and GTP-gamma-S. In the presence of 10(-5) M GTP-gamma-S the ED50 (Ca2+) was pCa 5.57 +/- 0.04 (2.69 microM) in the absence of ATP and declined to pCa 6.16 +/- 0.03 (0.69 microM) in the presence of ATP (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, ATP served to restore responsiveness in cells that had been rendered refractory by delaying stimulation after permeabilization. Pretreatment with PMA (an activator of PKC) inhibited the induction of a refractory state, whereas inhibition of PKC partially countered the ability of ATP to restore responsiveness, both observations pointing to a requirement for a specific component of the secretory mechanism to be in a phosphorylated state in order to condone the secretion process. These observations show that secretory mechanisms in eosinophils are similar to those in other myeloid cells, in particular neutrophils and mast cells, although the time course of secretion is more protracted.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that an aroA- strain of Salmonella typhimurium, which provides excellent protection against virulent Salmonella challenge, also rendered immunized mice unable to mount in vivo and in vitro antibody responses to heterologous Ag. Coculture studies using transwell plates indicated that suppression was mediated by soluble factors. The suppressive cells were identified as belonging to the monocytic linkage. Macrophage precursors as well as mature adherent macrophages mediated the observed suppression. In the present study, the mechanism of immunosuppression was investigated. Suppression was found to be genetically nonrestricted as spleen cells from immunized C3HeB/FeJ mice (H-2k) suppressed the anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses of normal spleen cells from two MHC noncompatible mouse strains, BALB/c (H-2d) and C57BL/6 (H-2b). Time course experiments demonstrated that the addition of spleen cells from immunized mice to normal splenocytes as late as day 4 of a 5-day assay was still markedly suppressive. Furthermore, suppression of the PFC responses was accompanied by a profound inhibition of the capacity of immune splenocytes to produce IL-2 in response to in vitro stimulation by Con A. Coculture studies showed that immune spleen cells were able to suppress IL-2 production by normal splenocytes in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the suppressed PFC responses of immune spleen cells could not be reversed by the exogenous addition of up to 200 U/ml of IL-2, suggesting that immune splenocytes are also defective in their ability to respond to IL-2. In marked contrast, suppression of PFC responses was reduced by more than 50% by the addition of as little as 1 U/ml of IL-4 and was completely abrogated when 5 U/ml of IL-4 were added to in vitro cultures of spleen cells from immunized mice. The antisuppressive action of IL-4 appeared to be via its inhibitory effect on activated macrophages. The implications of the above findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that human IgA1 can initiate lysis of group C Neisseria meningitidis via the classical C pathway when bound to specific outer membrane proteins, but that IgA1 can also function as a blocking antibody when bound to the polysaccharide capsule of meningococci. In this report, we further characterized IgA1 blockade by examining the effect of IgA1 on IgG-initiated immune lysis of group C meningococci. We purified IgG and monomeric IgA1 from either convalescent group C meningococcal case sera or tetravalent (A, C, Y, W135) polysaccharide vaccinate sera. In the absence of IgA1, IgG initiated complete lysis (greater than 99%) of strains 118V (C:P3,4:L2,4) 126E (C:P3:L1,8), and 35E (C:P5:L2). Addition of IgA1 to the bactericidal reaction mixture completely blocked the lytic function of IgG. Removal of the Fc portion of IgA1 with either pepsin or IgA1 protease did not affect blockade. Both the F(ab')2 and Fab derivatives of IgA1 blocked lysis quantitatively as well as intact IgA1. The Fc fragment produced by IgA1 protease cleavage neither increased nor decreased Fab-mediated blockade. IgA1 and its Fab and F(ab')2 fragments blocked IgG-initiated lysis via either the classical pathway in factor B-depleted and in properdin-deficient serum, the alternative pathway in MgEGTA-chelated serum, or both pathways combined. Absorption of the IgA1 and IgG with alum-bound group C polysaccharide completely removed blocking and lytic activity, respectively, indicating that both the blocking IgA1 and the lytic IgG were specific for the group C capsule. Blocking by IgA1 was a linear function of the polysaccharide Ag-binding capacity (ABC) ratio of blocking IgA1 to lytic IgG. Complete blockade was observed at an ABC ratio of 5.5. At ABC ratios of 3.3 and 4.4, IgA1 affected significant blockade whether added previous to, concurrent with, or subsequent to sensitization of the organisms with IgG. With the use of a C polysaccharide ELISA, we found that the binding of IgA1 to the group C capsule in the presence of IgG exhibited positive cooperativity and therefore that blockade was independent of the ability of IgA1 to directly compete with IgG for binding to epitopes within the group C capsule. We conclude that IgA1, when bound to the group C polysaccharide capsule, can block IgG-initiated lysis of group C meningococci through either the classical or the alternative pathway before or after the organism is exposed to IgG, and that blockade is an Fc-independent event.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined phagocytosis of Mycobacterium leprae by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared with monocytes, MDM exhibit greatly enhanced adherence of M. leprae (6.5 +/- 2-fold increase). MDM adherence of M. leprae is serum dependent and requires heat-labile serum components because heat inactivation of serum reduces adherence by 70 +/- 3%. mAb against C receptors CR1 (CD35), CR3 (CD11b/CD18), and CR4 (CD11c/CD18) inhibit phagocytosis of M. leprae in fresh nonimmune serum. Single mAb against each receptor inhibit M. leprae adherence by 25 +/- 4% - 33 +/- 6%. Single mAb used in combination against all three receptors inhibit M. leprae adherence by 51 +/- 6%. Most significantly, pairs of mAb used in combination against all three receptors inhibit by 80 +/- 4%. By electron microscopy, MDM ingest all M. leprae that adhere in fresh nonimmune serum. In the presence of mAb against CR1, CR3, and CR4, the percentage of MDM cross-sections that contain intracellular bacteria is reduced 66 +/- 3% and the mean number of bacteria per cross-section is reduced 78 +/- 10%. MDM activated by IFN-gamma exhibit markedly reduced adherence (by light microscopy) and ingestion (by electron microscopy) of M. leprae. MDM in culture for 5 days inhibit M. leprae adherence by 83 +/- 2% and ingestion by 88% when activated for 5 days. Paralleling this, IFN-gamma-activated MDM exhibit markedly reduced C receptor function, reflected by markedly decreased adherence and ingestion of C3b- and C3bi-coated E. Decreased C receptor function by IFN-gamma-activated MDM correlates with decreased surface expression of CR1 but not CR3 or CR4. CR1 expression on MDM in culture for 5 days is reduced by 32 +/- 9% and 75 +/- 3% after IFN-gamma activation for 5 and 2 days, respectively. This study demonstrates that MDM have an enhanced capacity to phagocytize M. leprae, and that in addition to CR1 and CR3, phagocytosis involves CR4, whose expression on MDM is highly maturation-dependent. This study also demonstrates that IFN-gamma activation markedly reduces the capacity of MDM to phagocytize M. leprae, and it provides a molecular mechanism for this phenomenon-decreased C receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "A recombinant form of the first lymphokine to be discovered, migration inhibitory factor (rMIF) was obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with a cDNA library from a human T cell hybridoma (6). rMIF has an amino acid sequence unrelated to that of any known protein. To learn more about the biology of MIF, we tested its ability to effect the survival of Leishmania donovani in macrophages. We found that rMIF activates blood monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro to suppress the growth of and kill these intracellular parasites. The anti-leishmanial effect (ranging from 50 to 77% reduction of parasites) is maximal when macrophages have been incubated with rMIF 48 to 72 h before infection and is similar to that seen with macrophages activated by IFN-gamma. Of interest, whereas the activation of human macrophages by IFN-gamma is inhibited by IL-4 and not enhanced by LPS, the activation by rMIF is enhanced by LPS but is not inhibited by IL-4. The data presented here demonstrate that rMIF is a potent activator of macrophages and is likely to be critical in cell-mediated immune host defenses.\r"

  ".W": "No vaccine is yet available against serogroup B meningococci, which are a common cause of bacterial meningitis. Some outer membrane proteins (OMP), LPS, and capsular polysaccharides have been identified as protective Ag. The amino acid sequence of the protective B cell epitopes present within the class 1 OMP has been described recently. Synthetic peptides containing OMP B cell epitopes as well as capsular polysaccharides or LPS protective B cell epitopes have to be presented to the immune system in association with T cell epitopes to achieve an optimal Ir. The use of homologous, i.e., meningococcal, T cell epitopes has many advantages. We therefore investigated recognition sites for human T cells within the meningococcal class 1 OMP. We have synthesized 16 class 1 OMP-derived peptides encompassing predicted T cell epitopes. Peptides corresponding to both surface loops and trans-membrane regions (some of which occur as amphipathic beta-sheets) of the class 1 OMP were found to be recognized by T cells. In addition, 10 of 11 peptides containing predicted amphipathic alpha-helices and four of five peptides containing T cell epitope motifs according to Rothbard and Taylor (Rothbard, J. B., and W. R. Taylor. 1988. EMBO J 7:93) were recognized by lymphocytes from one or more volunteers. Some of the T and B cell epitopes were shown to map to identical regions of the protein. At least six of the peptides that were found to contain T cell epitopes show homology to constant regions of the meningococcal class 3 OMP and the gonococcal porins PIA and PIB. Peptide-specific T cell lines and T cell clones were established to investigate peptide recognition in more detail. The use of a panel of HLA-typed APC revealed clear HLA-DR restriction patterns. It seems possible now to develop a (semi-) synthetic meningococcal vaccine with a limited number of constant T cell epitopes that cover all HLA-DR locus products.\r"

In order to try to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism, we tested the presence of several factors that are known to operate against intracellular parasites in other cell types. We found, by means of a competitive inhibitor, that L-arginine-dependent production of reactive nitrogen intermediates was not the cause of inhibition of T. gondii proliferation, thus contrasting with the inhibitory mechanism found in activated mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the inhibition of replication was not overcome by oxygen scavengers or by saturation of the system with tryptophan, suggesting that neither reactive oxygen intermediates nor the induction of tryptophan starvation was responsible.\r"

  ".W": "A rearranged murine V kappa 8/J kappa 5 L chain gene that codes for the L chain of most antibodies generated in the primary response of BALB/c mice to the antigenic site, Sb, of the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8) has been cloned. Three transgenic lines were generated by microinjecting the gene. Lines Ga and L each contain a single copy of the transgene whereas line Gb contains three complete copies. Mice of the Ga lineage showed increased V kappa 8-specific mRNA levels only in spleen, but not in nonlymphoid organs and therefore displayed apparently normal lymphoid-specific regulation of the Ig transgene. B cell hybridomas generated from these mice were analyzed for rearrangements of endogenous V kappa genes. Greater than 90% of the C kappa alleles were retained in germ-line configuration in the Ga line, compared with only 0 to 18% in the L line. Thus, a wide variation in the frequency of endogenous rearrangements is seen among mice of different lineages using the same transgene construct. None of more than 150 hybridomas derived from LPS-stimulated splenic B cells of Ga mice exhibited HA-binding activity although they expressed the transgene and, in most cases, excluded endogenous V kappa rearrangements. In contrast, a large fraction of hybridomas isolated after primary immunization with PR8 were HA(Sb)-specific. This indicated that the transgene was functional but formed HA-specific antibodies with a more restricted set of H chains than previously hypothesized. The primary anti-HA response to immunization with PR8 was diminished in all lines compared with normal mice except for a slightly accelerated but transient burst of anti-HA antibody formation in two out of three lines (Ga and Gb). This early response in G lineage mice was largely specific for HA(Sb) and thus appeared to be composed of transgene-expressing antibodies. No differences in serum titers were observed in the secondary anti-HA responses to booster inoculation with PR8 between transgenic and normal mice.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine TNF mediates many of the pathologic signs of cachexia, inflammation, and sepsis. The current work describes the regulation of TNF in human myelomonocytic cell lines after PMA stimulation. The cell lines exhibit a low level of constitutive TNF mRNA expression. Within 2 to 4 h of PMA exposure, steady state levels of TNF mRNA are markedly elevated in all myelomonocytic cell lines studied. This rise is due to increased mRNA stability, which increased by almost twofold, and to an overall increase in transcription, which rises by more than sixfold. At the level of the genomic TNF gene, a DNase I hypersensitive site is detected within the TNF promoter between -200 to -100 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. Although absent in nonexpressing erythroleukemia cell lines, the DNase I site is present in uninduced myelomonocytic cell lines and is not changed after PMA induction. The PMA induction of c-fos mRNA correlated well with TNF gene induction; expression of genes encoding other proteins in the AP-1 complex (junB and junD) were also induced by PMA. The nuclear extracts from resting and induced ML-1 cells contain proteins binding specifically to the AP-1, AP-2, and NF kappa B sequence located within the TNF promoter. PMA induction increases the level of a number of specific binding complexes relative to the resting cells. The regulatory mechanisms of the human and murine TNF genes are discussed.\r"

Analysis based on a single comprehensive index is preferable to the use of several indexes as it avoids the potential for conflicting inferences from multiple comparisons. In this paper, we describe the development of a QL index which summarizes the three questionnaires used in the North Karelian Quality of Life (KarQuol) study. The summary index (SI) will be used to compare transdermal and oral nitrate therapy in patients with angina pectoris, and represents the first stage in the construction of a disease-specific evaluative index for future trials.\r"

During the cross-over period 30 patients (20 on TN and 10 on LAON) withdrew from the study, over half of them within the first month. Although the results should be interpreted with some caution, they showed that improvement in QL was present for both treatments but greater during the transdermal therapy (unadjusted p = 0.07, adjusted p = 0.03). Anginal attacks were associated with improved QL scores, and fewer attacks occurred on TN (p = 0.06). Improvement in QL was most pronounced in patients whose recorded duration of angina was less than 8 years.\r"

The respiratory gas was sampled from the nasopharynx via a special nasal catheter and analyzed by a side-stream analyzer. In each case, optimal placement of the nasal catheter was determined by CO2 waveform and the capnograms were recorded for waveform analysis and trend monitoring. PETCO2 was compared with arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) two to four times during the 2- to 19-hour observation periods by simultaneous measurements. For 65 simultaneous measurements, mean PETCO2 was 38.9 +/- 5.7 mm Hg (range, 26.3 to 48.3 mm Hg) and mean PaCO2 was 38.9 +/- 5.7 mm Hg (range, 26.8 to 46.0 mm Hg; r = 0.82; p less than 0.01). While the mean values for PETCO2 and PaCO2 were similar, several patients had large differences for PaCO2 to PETCO2. The differences of the individual patients did not differ significantly between the various times of measurement. We conclude that this form of capnometry is well suited for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of respiration in nonintubated, spontaneously breathing patients.\r"

The unit was evaluated for its effectiveness as an oxygenation device and its accuracy as a predictor of PaCO2 through the correlation of PaCO2 with PETCO2. Twenty cardiac surgical patients, physical status ASA 2-4, participated in this study. The PETCO2 monitoring device consisted of a dual-prong nasal oxygen cannula and a 14-gauge intravenous catheter that was inserted into one limb of the oxygen supply tubing and connected to a Datex gas analyzer (Datex Instrumentation Corp, Helsinki, Finland) to measure PETCO2. The cross-over passage between the prongs was intentionally blocked with the end of a wooden-core cotton swab. The oxygen flow rates were randomly varied (2, 4, and 6 L/min) every 5 minutes, and values for PETCO2 as well as arterial blood samples for analysis of PaCO2 and PaO2 were obtained at the end of each 5-minute period. The accuracy of the system was assessed by comparing the PaCO2-PETCO2 differences (bias) at each oxygen flow rate. The ratios of PETCO2 compared with PaCO2 were 0.98, 0.94, and 0.85, with correlation coefficients of r = 0.81, 0.85, and 0.63, respectively. The PaO2 values were 114, 154, and 183 mm Hg for the corresponding nasal oxygen flow rates of 2, 4, and 6 L/min, respectively. This study indicates that this modified nasal cannula provides supplemental oxygen adequately and yields a satisfactory reflection of the PaCO2 depending on the oxygen flow rate delivered.\r"

Ten volunteers were blinded to the concentrations of carbon dioxide in an airway circuit/lung model, and the minimal concentration of carbon dioxide that caused a perceivable color change was recorded. The mean minimum concentration required for detection of a color change was 0.54% (4.1 mm Hg) and ranged from 0.25 to 0.60% (1.9 to 4.6 mm Hg).

Intraperitoneal administration of (-)-deprenyl (0.5-8 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of striatal monoamine oxidase type B activity whereas monamine oxidase type A activity in the striatum was inhibited only by 8 mg kg-1 of (-)-deprenyl. Intraperitoneal administration of (-)-deprenyl (0.5-4 mg kg-1) did not alter the striatal concentrations of dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) or homovanillic acid. DOPAC concentrations were decreased by 8 mg kg-1 of (-)-deprenyl. In contrast, administration of clorgyline (2 mg kg-1), a monoamine oxidase type A inhibitor, increased the striatal concentrations of DA and decreased the striatal concentrations of DOPAC and homovanillic acid. The striatal concentrations of 2-phenylethylamine (PE), a putative modulator of striatal DA transmission, were increased by (-)-deprenyl (1-8 mg kg-1) but were unaffected by clorgyline (2 mg kg-1). In electrophysiological studies, single caudate neuron responses to iontophoretically applied (-)-apomorphine and (+/-)-2-(N-phenethyl-N-propyl) amino-5-hydroxytetralin were potentiated by intracarotid injections of PE (30 micrograms kg-1) and i.p. injections of (-)-deprenyl (2 mg kg-1).

The inhibition was reversed by L-arginine but not by the D-enantiomer. L-NA also suppressed the endothelium-dependent relaxation by substance P but not the response to NO and nitroglycerin. Treatment with high concentrations of nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside markedly inhibited the relaxant response to nicotine, substance P and NO but not the response to papaverine. Slight, slowly developing relaxations caused by L-arginine in the endothelium-denuded arteries were not potentiated by repeated applications of the amino acid or by exposure of the strips for 24 hr to the bathing medium. Ca++ ionophore-induced contractions in the denuded strips were not potentiated by L-NA. Nicotine significantly increased the level of cyclic GMP in the arteries without endothelium; the increment was abolished by treatment with L-NA and hexamethonium. NO does not seem to be synthesized in smooth muscle in an amount sufficient to produce significant relaxation. It may be concluded that NO liberated from vasodilator nerves activates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscle and produces cyclic GMP, resulting in cerebroarterial relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "Nicorandil increases cyclic 3'5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle. However, high concentrations are required to activate guanylate cyclase (GC). We examined the relationship between activation of GC, increases in cGMP and relaxation in canine mesenteric artery and vein, renal and coronary artery and thoracic aorta. Nicorandil (10-100 microM) relaxed in each of the blood vessels. Relaxation was associated with elevations of cGMP but independent of release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and inhibited by methylene blue and hemoglobin. The organic nitrate esters nitroglycerin, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, 2-isosorbide mononitrate, and 5-isosorbide mononitrate each behaved in a similar manner. In each blood vessel pentaerythritol tetranitrate was the most potent and 5-isosorbide mononitrate the least potent relaxant and stimulant of cGMP. Each of the organic nitrate esters (1 microM to 1 mM) except nicorandil stimulated soluble GC activity in the presence of 10 mM cysteine. Nicorandil (EC50 38 mM) increased GC activity. Moreover, nicorandil (0.1 microM to 30 microM) did not inhibit cGMP phosphodiesterase. The EC50 for vascular relaxation was directly correlated with the EC50 for elevation of cGMP for each of the agonists in each blood vessel type. The EC50 for activation of GC was directly related to the reciprocal of the rate constant for nitric oxide formation for each of the organic nitrate esters. However, a direct correlation existed between the EC50 for activation of GC and the EC50 for 1) elevation of cGMP and 2) relaxation, for each of the organic nitrate esters except nicorandil. Thus, the high concentrations of nicorandil required to activate GC cannot account for the low concentrations required to elevate cGMP or relax smooth muscle. We postulate that nicorandil may interact with a membrane receptor or release a second messenger, distinct from nitric oxide or endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which then activates GC. This may represent a physiologic mechanism for regulation of GC activity in smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported recently that adenosine and ATP produce dose- and tone-dependent responses in the feline pulmonary vascular (PV) bed. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms mediating vasoconstrictor (VC) responses to adenosine and ATP in the intact-chest, spontaneously breathing cat under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. The order of potency of adenosine receptor agonists to produce VC in the PV bed was the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist R-phenylisopropyladenosine greater than the mixed A1, A2 receptor agonist, adenosine greater than the selective adenosine A2 receptor agonist, 2-phenylaminoadenosine. The dose-related increase in lobar arterial pressure in response to adenosine was blocked by an adenosine (P1) receptor antagonist, BWA1433U, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, meclofenamate, and the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, SQ29548. The order of potency of ATP analogs to produce VC in the PV bed was alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta-meATP) much greater than beta,tau-methylene ATP greater than ATP. BWA1433U inhibited VC responses to ATP without affecting responses to its degradation-resistant analogs beta,tau-methylene ATP and alpha,beta-meATP. In the presence of BWA1433U and a continuous intralobar infusion of the selective 5'-nucleotidase inhibitor, alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine-5'-diphosphate, ATP VC responses are significantly enhanced compared to those after BWA1433U. alpha,beta-Methyleneadenosine-5'-diphosphate had no effect on the VC response to U44069 after BWA1433U. Meclofenamate significantly inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to ATP but not to alpha,beta-meATP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "G proteins have been implicated in the development of opioid dependence of the guinea pig myenteric plexus as chronic fentanyl elevates G0/i alpha and pertussis toxin prevents this phenomenon. Therefore, the present study investigates G proteins more closely in this peripheral nerve plexus after chronic exposure to addictive drugs of the opiate and nonopiate type. After 6 days of treatment with either the mu receptor ligand fentanyl, the kappa- agonist U-50,488H or the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor ligand clonidine, at doses which render the myenteric plexus tolerant and dependent, the G protein subunits Go alpha and G beta were quantified by immunoblot analysis by using polyclonal antisera. Regardless of the drug used, these G proteins were found to be significantly increased in particulate membrane preparations linked to nerve somata and nerve terminals. This increase in G protein subunits is developed maximally after 6 days, is dose-dependent and reversible upon termination of the drug supply. The concentrations found elevated return to control levels within 4 to 5 days after commencing withdrawal. The common increase of Go alpha and G beta subunits observed after chronic opiate or clonidine exposure is associated with the phenomenon of cross-dependence among all drugs studied. The findings may suggest that in the guinea pig myenteric plexus multiple inhibitory receptor types make use of a common pool of G proteins.\r"

These changes were accompanied by marked potentiations of the natriuretic and diuretic responses to the ANF-releasing stimulus, whereas kaliuresis was only slightly affected. Thiorphan also enhanced markedly the biphasic rise in urinary cyclic GMP excretion elicited by volume expansion. All these renal responses to volume expansion in thiorphan-treated rats were significantly reduced by pretreatment with anti-ANF antibodies, suggesting an involvement of the endogenous natriuretic hormone protected against degradation. However, pretreatment with antibradykinin antibodies led to qualitatively similar results, suggesting that the endogenous kinin-generating system in kidney may also participate in the responses to endogenous ANF and their potentiation by the peptidase inhibitor.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely appreciated that protein kinase C (PKC) is activated in a variety of secretory cells after stimulation. By using two complementary pharmacologic approaches, we have investigated the role of PKC in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated secretion from human lung, bronchoalveolar lavage and skin mast cells. We examined the effect of the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, on goat anti-human IgE-induced mediator release. In lung mast cells, the IC50 for staurosporine on histamine release was 2.8 +/- 1.4 nM (n = 9). The drug was slightly more potent in skin mast cells where the IC50 was 0.64 +/- 2.0 nM (n = 6), but staurosporine had no effect on the IgE-mediated release of histamine from bronchoalveolar lavage mast cells. Mast cells were also incubated overnight with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to down regulate PKC and the response to goat anti-human IgE was measured. Prolonged exposure to 100 ng/ml of TPA reduced IgE-mediated histamine release from 28 +/- 6 to 6 +/- 1% in the skin mast cells whereas similar treatment only reduced the response of lung mast cells from 36 +/- 5 to 26 +/- 6%. Despite using agents which act by different mechanisms, short-term inhibition with staurosporine and long-term treatment with TPA, we obtained consistent results which suggest that PKC is playing a prorelease role in IgE-mediated signaling. Our results also suggest that skin and lung mast cells are more sensitive to PKC down-regulation than bronchoalveolar mast cells. This heterogeneity between human mast cells at the level of PKC regulation of cell activation is previously undescribed.\r"

  ".W": "Depletion of intracellular sulfhydryl groups has been considered a main reason for the development of nitrate tolerance during sustained nitrate therapy. Although administration of N-acetyl-cysteine, a sulfhydryl donor, potentiates the acute hypotensive effect of nitroglycerin (NTG), its role in the reversal of nitrate tolerance is controversial. In the present study, we developed a conscious in vivo rat model to study nitrate tolerance and nitrate-thiol interactions. Tolerance to NTG, as assessed by the blood pressure reduction in response to i.v. NTG bolus doses, developed after 24 h of i.v. NTG infusion. After 3 and 5 days of 0.2 mg/h NTG i.v., the dose-response relations for NTG-induced reduction in blood pressure were shifted to 25-fold higher doses (P less than .01). Infusion of N-acetylcysteine (0.245, 1.225 and 6.125 mmol/kg/h for 4 h) and, to a lesser extent, equimolar doses of reduced glutathione, but not N-acetylserine, significantly potentiated the hypotensive effect of NTG, in a dose-dependent manner (P less than .05). However, complete reversal of tolerance was not achieved. This animal model of nitrate tolerance is suitable for further investigations of nitrate-thiol interactions and shares similarities with nitrate tolerance development in humans. The results suggest that sulfhydryl supplementation may enhance the hypotensive effect of NTG in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is more likely to be achieved with N-acetylcysteine than with glutathione and may be related to differences in membrane permeability.\r"

  ".U": "91366618\r", 
  ".W": "The cellular basis for hormonal control of bone resorption is poorly understood. As the identifiable receptors for bone resorbing agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] are located on osteoblasts rather than osteoclasts, the nature of cellular signaling is obscure. Here it is reported that exposure of fetal rat limb bones to pertussis toxin, a bacterial protein that inhibits certain GTP binding proteins (G-proteins) involved in signal transduction, markedly inhibits bone resorption elicited by PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3 and prostaglandin E2. Pertussis toxin does not block the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by PTH or 1,25(OH)2D3, and it potentiates the cyclic AMP response to PTH. These data support the existence of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein that participates in regulation of bone resorption. The putative G-protein is apparently not involved in the initial transduction of hormonal signals, but it may be part of a final common pathway through which the osteoclast is activated by agents with widely divergent initial actions.\r"

  ".W": "The muscarinic m1 and m2 receptors are functionally coupled to multiple effectors via distinct guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G-proteins) defined by their pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitivity. Both receptors are coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI), whereas only the m2 receptors inhibit cAMP formation. This study examines how the selective interactions of these two receptors with G-proteins may govern their specific functional coupling to the two second messenger pathways. Murine fibroblasts (B82) transfected with the rat m1 or m2 receptor genes were used to test the PTX sensitivity of the m1 and m2 receptor-mediated pathways. It was found that the stimulation of PI hydrolysis and inhibition of cyclic AMP mediated by m2 receptors had similar PTX sensitivity (IC50 = 0.14 ng/ml and 0.26 ng/ml), whereas the m1-mediated PI hydrolysis was PTX insensitive. The EC50 value for carbachol in the m1 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was 9.5 microM, whereas those for the m2 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis and inhibition of cyclic AMP formation were 0.3 microM and 1.2 microM, respectively. The potency of carbachol correlated well with its binding affinities for the two receptor subtypes. These results suggest that the m2 receptors are coupled to multiple pathways via PTX-sensitive G-proteins, which are distinct from those that interact with the m1 receptor. The formation of functional receptor-G-protein complexes may be selective and governed by the efficiencies in coupling between receptors and G-proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The role of cyclic GMP (cGMP) in mediating relaxation of canine trachealis produced by nitrovasodilators (NVDs), compounds that activate guanylate cyclase, was examined. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the canine trachealis that was accompanied by a concentration-related increase in cGMP content. In time course studies, relaxation of isolated trachealis strips induced by 30 microM SNP was paralleled by an increase in cGMP that reached a maximum of 18-fold above basal levels within 2 min. Zaprinast, an inhibitor of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, potentiated both SNP-induced relaxation and cGMP accumulation. A cell-permeable analog of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, mimicked the relaxant effects of SNP. Also assessed were the effects of methylene blue, an agent that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activity, and hemoglobin, an agent that competitively binds NO-containing compounds. In these experiments, tissues were pretreated with the above agents for 10 min, contracted with 1 or 3 microM methacholine, and then relaxed by the cumulative addition of SNP or two other NVDs, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Tissues were flash-frozen after adding the final concentration of the various NVDs and assayed for cGMP. Methylene blue and hemoglobin suppressed both cGMP accumulation and relaxation in response to SNAP and GTN. in contrast, methylene blue and hemoglobin inhibited SNP-induced cGMP accumulation but, paradoxically, potentiated SNP-induced relaxation. The results of this study generally support a role for cGMP in NVD-induced relaxation of airway smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies are antiphospholipid antibodies that have been associated with fetal loss, but they have not been shown unequivocally to be a risk factor for this event. METHODS. To estimate the risk of fetal loss in association with these antibodies, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 331 women with spontaneous abortion or fetal death (case patients) and 993 controls. The subjects were included in the study only if they reported that they had had no previous spontaneous fetal loss. Each control was a pregnant woman who, in the same period of pregnancy as a case patient, had not had a fetal loss. Lupus anticoagulants were identified in blood samples through a series of coagulation tests, and IgG anticardiolipins by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each subject was interviewed in person to obtain information on potential confounding variables, such as sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions. RESULTS. Lupus anticoagulants were found in blood from 17 case patients (5.1 percent) and 38 controls (3.8 percent). The crude odds ratio for the association between lupus anticoagulants and fetal loss was 1.36 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 2.43); the odds ratio adjusted for confounders was 1.42 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 2.80). An IgG anticardiolipin level of 5 units or more was found in 4 case patients (1.2 percent) and 15 controls (1.5 percent). The crude and adjusted odds ratios for fetal loss were 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 2.41) and 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 4.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. There is not apparent justification for considering lupus anticoagulants or IgG anticardiolipins to be risk factors for fetal loss among women who present with spontaneous abortion or fetal death and have had no previous spontaneous fetal loss.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain is important in view of its roles in neuropsychiatric illnesses. Dopamine D1 receptors, which stimulate both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and D2 receptors, which inhibit them, can nevertheless act synergistically to produce many electrophysiological and behavioral responses. Because this functional synergism can occur at the level of single neurons, another, as yet unidentified, signalling pathway activated by dopamine has been hypothesized. We report here that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the D2 receptor complementary DNA, D2 agonists potently enhanced arachidonic acid release, provided that such release has been initiated by stimulating constitutive purinergic receptors or by increasing intracellular Ca2+. In CHO cells expressed D1 receptors, D1 agonists exert no such effect. When D1 and D2 receptors are coexpressed, however, activation of both subtypes results in a marked synergistic potentiation of arachidonic acid release. The numerous actions of arachidonic acid and its metabolites in neuronal signal transduction suggest that facilitation of its release may be implicated in dopaminergic responses, such as feedback inhibition mediated by D2 autoreceptors, and may constitute a molecular basis for D1/D2 receptor synergism.\r"

They are unique in requiring both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation to become active and are the only examples of protein-serine/threonine kinases activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes differentiation of phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which respond by conversion within hours from a chromaffin-like to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. NGF stimulation of PC12 cells increases the activity of two protein kinases by greater than 20-fold within minutes, both strikingly similar to MAPKs. They are inactivated by either protein-tyrosine phosphatases or the protein-serine/threonine phosphatase termed protein phosphatase 2A (ref. 8), they activate protein S6 kinase-II (refs 9, 10), and they phosphorylate identical threonine residues on myelin basic protein (our unpublished results) to those phosphorylated by other MAPKs. Immunological data indicate that these protein kinases, termed peak-I and peak-II (Fig. 1a) are probably ERK2 and ERK1, respectively, two widely expressed MAPK isoforms. Here we identify the 'MAP kinase kinases' (MAPKKs) in PC12 cells which are activated by NGF and report that MAPKKs are dependent on serine/threonine phosphorylation for activity and promote phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues on MAPKs.\r"

Mitochondrial mRNAs in particular, including those from plants, seem to be the subject of extensive editing, unlike mRNAs encoded by chloroplast DNA, for which the prediction of amino-acid sequence from the corresponding gene sequence is generally unambiguous. Occasionally, however, an ACG codon appears at the 5' terminus of chloroplast genes, where the initiation codon ATG would be expected. Here we present evidence for a C----U editing that is responsible for the conversion of the ACG codon to an AUG initiation codon in the mRNA transcript from the rpl2 gene of the maize plastome, showing that mRNA editing can also occur in chloroplasts.\r"

  ".U": "91367265\r", 
  ".W": "After cellularization of the Drosophila embryo, positional differences within each primordial segment are maintained and elaborated by processes that require cell interactions. The best-documented examples of such intercellular signalling are the mutual interactions between neighbouring cells expressing the homeodomain protein engrailed and the secreted glycoprotein encoded by wingless, the Drosophila homologue of the murine Wnt-1 gene. Little is known about the molecular basis of these signalling mechanisms but the activities of several other genes, notably patched and hedgehog, have been implicated in the process. Here we show that the role of patched in positional signalling is permissive rather than instructive, its activity being required to suppress wingless transcription in cells predisposed to express the latter. According to this view, expression of wingless is normally maintained only in those cells receiving an extrinsic signal, encoded by hedgehog, that antagonizes the repressive activity of patched. We suggest that the patched protein may itself be the receptor for this signal, implying that this is an unusual mechanism of ligand-dependent receptor inactivation.\r"

  ".W": "In the Drosophila embryo, mutations in the segment polarity gene patched (ptc) cause the replacement of the middle region of each segment by a mirror-image duplication of the remaining structures, including the parasegmental border. This gene, which encodes a transmembrane protein, is initially expressed in a generalized way at blastoderm, but later stops being transcribed in cells expressing the engrailed gene, and even later in cells in the middle of the parasegment. The genes engrailed (en) and wingless (wg) are also segment-polarity genes, and they are expressed in adjacent stripes flanking the parasegment borders in the embryo; in ptc mutants wg expression extends anteriorly and an ectopic stripe of en expression is induced. The suggestion has been made that ptc must be transcribed in a specific subset of cells to prevent en expression anterior to the wg-expressing stripe. Here we report that unrestricted expression of ptc from a heat-shock promoter has no adverse effect on development of Drosophila embryos. The heat-shock construct can also rescue ptc mutants, restoring wg expression to its normal narrow stripe. The ectopic en stripe fails to appear, but the normal one remains unaffected. The results imply that, despite its localized requirement, the restricted expression of ptc does not itself allocate positional information.\r"

Preparations of buffy coat and whole blood, containing as well as reduced of WBCs, were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium species. Upon storage at room temperature, the presence of WBCs resulted in a reduction of the bacterial content. Units inoculated with S. epidermidis and E. coli were completely cleared of bacteria within 5 to 24 hours. On the other hand, S. aureus, after an initial reduction in number, started to multiply. In WBC-reduced units, the initial bacterial content remained unchanged for 5 hours, but the bacteria then exhibited vigorous growth within 48 hours in buffy coat and slower growth in whole blood. Propionibacterium sp. did not grow with or without WBCs. P. aeruginosa did not grow in buffy coat but showed a growth pattern similar to that of S. aureus in whole blood. The presence of WBCs in the donor blood during the first hours after collection thus seems to rid the blood of at least some species of bacteria. These results indicate that it would be favorable not to perform WBC reduction during blood collection and that several hours of contact can be needed to obtain sterility.\r"

They differ markedly from the monoclonal anti-Sia-b1 FI CA, which recognizes an epitope not expressed on Oh cells, and resistant to the enzyme. On the other side, Sia-b1 determinants reacting with postinfection CAs share the characteristics of I determinants, with the exception that Sia-b1 determinants require sialyl groups as an immunodominant component. Five sera containing coexisting anti-Sia-b1 and anti-I CAs were tested against Oh and enzyme-treated group O red cells. The results are consistent with a postinfection autoimmune response against a sialo-type 2 structure common for Sia-b1 and I determinants, which could serve as a receptor for Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\r"

The adverse effects associated with its administration have been postulated to result from complement activation. When gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of Fluosol are used after its incubation with serum, activated C3 and factors Bb and H are bound to the Fluosol particles in a time-dependent fashion, which suggests that complement activation with Fluosol, as does that with zymosan, occurs on the surface of the particles. Paradoxically, it is found, both by the measurement of Fluosol-bound C3d and by fluid-phase C5a, that lower concentrations of Fluosol cause greater amounts of complement activation, which suggests a complex interaction of activators and inhibitors that changes as the available surface area is decreased. Studies performed with bystander red cell-bound C3d demonstrated in vivo complement activation occurring in six patients receiving Fluosol as an adjunct to chemotherapy for colon cancer. In two patients, there was a marked increase in red cell-bound C3d after Fluosol infusion; these two patients also developed adverse reactions during Fluosol infusion. These studies suggest that the Fluosol surface plays a major role in the initiation and regulation of complement activation that is seen during Fluosol infusion.\r"

Success rate, fluoroscopic and room times, and tube position were determined. Unsuccessful fluoroscopic placement was followed immediately by an endoscopic attempt. The success rate for fluoroscopic placement was 90% (94/104), with the tube placed into the jejunum in 53% and into the duodenum in 47%. The fluoroscopic and room times for successful fluoroscopic placements were 8.6 +/- 5.6 min (mean +/- SD) and 21.7 +/- 8.4 min, respectively. For the 10 unsuccessful placements, the fluoroscopic and room times were 16.2 +/- 5.4 min (mean +/- SD) and 45.6 +/- 18.4 min, respectively. Both time differences were significant statistically. Endoscopic placement was successful in all seven patients in whom it was attempted, with a mean time of 13.4 min. The tubes placed endoscopically were in the jejunum in 29% and in the duodenum in 71%. Our results show that fluoroscopic and endoscopic placement of enteral feeding tubes is highly effective. Fluoroscopic time in successful cases is usually less than 15 min. Endoscopic placement of feeding tubes is successful after fluoroscopic failure.\r"

Radiology residents performed a brief but thorough physical examination of the ankle in all 201 patients. Solely on the basis of a strict set of physical examination criteria (examination for gross deformity, instability, crepitation, focal bony tenderness, severe soft-tissue tenderness, moderate or severe soft-tissue swelling, and ecchymosis), the radiologists determined whether or not the radiographs were indicated. All patients, irrespective of the physical examination, underwent ankle radiography, and the results were correlated with those of the physical examination. On the basis of the results of the physical examinations, 101 (50%) of the radiologic studies were not indicated. In only one of these patients was a fracture seen on radiographs. The radiograph in this case showed a small avulsion fracture of the dorsal aspect of the talus that was clinically insignificant (no cast or surgery was required).

Hypertension developed in all four children before they were 4 years old; three had differences between upper- and lower-extremity blood pressures. Irregular narrowing of the abdominal aorta with either multiple minor asymmetric wall lesions (n = 2) or abrupt concentric narrowing (n = 2) was present in all children as shown by aortography (n = 3), sonography (n = 3), MR imaging (n = 2), and/or autopsy (n = 1). A variety of other vessels also were involved, including the ascending aorta (n = 1) and vertebral (n = 1), axillary (n = 1), intercostal (n = 2), lumbar (n = 2), mesenteric (n = 3), renal (n = 2), and iliac arteries (n = 3). Autopsy in one child demonstrated thickened heart valves, narrowing of the coronary arteries, and irregularity of the aorta due to deposition of mucopolysaccharide material within the intima. Our series demonstrates various facets of the arteriopathy of MPS I as shown by sonography, MR imaging, and angiography.\r"

The incidence and frequency of intracoronary thrombus formation are presently under active assessment in order to establish the potential benefit of thrombolytic therapy. A preliminary study was conducted in patients admitted in our coronary care unit for unstable angina with typical clinical and electrocardiographic criteria and with early coronary angiogram. After exclusion of 4 patients with left main coronary stenosis or contraindications for thrombolysis, 16 patients received thrombolytic infusion and 14 underwent a second coronary angiogram. Seven patients had an intracoronary thrombus (6 nonocclusive, 1 occlusive) and at the second angiogram only 3 nonocclusive thrombi were modified (1 disappeared, 2 were reduced). Moreover, the quantitative Coronary Angiography Analysis System (CAAS) in the 11 cases suitable for analysis did not show any significant changes, especially in the Ambrose type IIB lesions. In-hospital clinical outcome was not influenced by thrombolytic therapy (5 ischemic recurrences, 1 fatal myocardial infarction, 4 emergency and 4 elective revascularization procedures). This short series is in agreement with the literature data. Only one third of patients with active unstable angina remains refractory to conventional therapy. The transient benefit of thrombolysis is limited to patients with demonstrated intracoronary thrombi. Clinical or angiographic improvement are not always in correlation and until now do not seem able to prevent short-term recurrences or the need for revascularization procedures.\r"

Serial measurements of cardiac output, right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures, as well as plasma ANF, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and vasopressin were obtained before and 30 minutes after acute volume expansion to raise wedge pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. Baseline mean right atrial pressure and plasma ANF levels were greater in patients with than without RV infarction (8 +/- 3 vs 5 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001, and 4.6 +/- 2.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/ml; p less than 0.05, respectively). There were no differences in other baseline hemodynamic or humoral parameters between both groups. After volume expansion, pulmonary wedge pressure was similar in both groups, but right atrial pressure increased to higher levels in patients with RV infarction (19 +/- 2 vs 14 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001). Despite this greater stimulus for ANF secretion, the increase in plasma ANF was less pronounced in patients with RV infarction (63 +/- 81 vs 455 +/- 417%; p less than 0.002), especially among those with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thus, despite higher baseline plasma levels of ANF, response to volume loading is markedly attenuated in patients with RV infarction complicating an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Twenty-two of these had immunoglobulin G-M protein, three had light chain MM, and one had immunoglobulin A-MM protein. None of the immunoglobulin GD-MM (n = 2), nonsecretory MM (n = 5), or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients (n = 5) were positive. None of the patients had hemolysis attributable to the adsorption of the M protein. The serum concentration of M protein was higher in DAT-positive patients (57.6 +/- 3.8 g/L, mean +/- SEM) than in the negative ones (35.7 +/- 6.4 g/L; probability value of the difference was less than 0.01). The erythrocyte eluates from DAT-positive patients contained a single immunoglobulin, of the same class as the M protein, and did not react with a panel of ABO-compatible erythrocytes. Addition of melphalan during incubation did not affect the results. The M protein of DAT-positive patients was of immunoglobulin G-3 subclass in 7 of 10 patients. A positive direct antiglobulin test frequently is seen in patients with multiple myeloma, the reaction is due to passive adsorption of the M protein onto the erythrocytes, is most frequently observed with immunoglobulin G3-MM, and usually does not produce hemolysis.\r"

PATIENTS: Eight patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension were entered in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study of 39 days' duration. METHODS: Two 7-day periods while on a fixed sodium intake of 150 mmol/day approximately 3 weeks apart. After 4 days of a placebo and fixed sodium intake, patients were given nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) once a day and carefully studied for the following 4 days. Thereafter, patients continued to receive nifedipine GITS, and approximately 3 weeks later they were studied again for a week while on a fixed sodium intake. Nifedipine administration was stopped and changes occurring after withdrawal were studied. RESULTS: Nifedipine caused a significant increase in sodium excretion with a cumulative loss of sodium of 38 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of treatment. The withdrawal of nifedipine treatment caused a significant decrease in sodium excretion and a cumulative retention of sodium of 42 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine causes an acute and a sustained reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension. This prolonged effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that in polycystic ovary syndrome ovarian steroids can influence adrenal steroidogenesis. To test this hypothesis, basal and dexamethasone-suppressed-corticotropin-stimulated steroid hormone responses were compared among three groups of women before, during, and after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment for 3 months. The groups were characterized as follows: (1) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (greater than 400 micrograms/dl), (2) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (less than 300 micrograms/dl), and (3) normal ovulatory women. In response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, basal serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, estrone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone in all three groups were suppressed to similar levels. Basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in the group with high levels declined, but they did not reach the normal, unaltered concentrations in the other two groups. Two subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome in this group with high levels, who showed the greatest declines in basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (34%, 40%), also had evidence of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency before treatment, which was resolved by the end of treatment. In both groups with polycystic ovary syndrome, the increase in maximum incremental rise of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in response to a pharmacologic dose of corticotropin from a dexamethasone-suppressed baseline (adrenal androgen capacity) remained unaltered during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration. We conclude that ovarian steroids may promote excessive adrenal androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, may induce 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency as a mechanism for adrenal involvement in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and do not influence adrenal androgen capacity.\r"

  ".W": "Two peptides with natriuretic and diuretic properties consisting of amino acids 1 to 30 and 31 to 67 of the 98 amino acid N-terminal end of the prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor, which normally circulates in humans, were investigated to determine if they have specific binding sites of placental membranes. Competitive binding experiments revealed that atrial natriuretic peptides 1 to 30, 31 to 67, and 99 to 126 (i.e., C-terminus) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for atrial natriuretic peptides 1 to 30, 31 to 67, and 99 to 126 binding to human placental membranes were similar at 4.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/L, 3.1 +/- 0.4 nmol/L, and 2.9 +/- 0.5 nmol/L, respectively. Each peptide bound to the placental membranes between 10(-8) and 10(-11) mol/L but could bind to the other peptides' receptors only at supraphysiologic concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7) mol/L. The protease inhibitor aprotinin (50 micrograms/ml) blocked the binding of the atrial natriuretic peptides 1 to 30, 31 to 67, and 99 to 126 to their respective receptors. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptides 1 to 30 and 31 to 67 do not work through the atrial natriuretic factor receptor but rather have their own separate and distinct receptors on placental membranes and that the protease inhibitor aprotinin antagonizes their respective binding to placental membranes, suggesting that integral membrane proteases may be modulators of atrial natriuretic peptides receptor function.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide values fell after supine posture in only half the women and supine hypotension occurred in one subject. These studies demonstrate that upright and prolonged lateral recumbent postures significantly influence plasma atrial natriuretic peptide values during pregnancy, as they do in the nonpregnant state, but that supine posture does not alter plasma atrial natriuretic peptide values significantly. Posture must be carefully accounted for in any study of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in pregnancy.\r"

Comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns revealed that the first case of choriocarcinoma carried the parental genome and originated from the third normal pregnancy, whereas the second case was of androgenetic origin from the complete mole. By choosing an appropriate probe (or probes), restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis is shown to be a useful method for identification of the pregnancy responsible for choriocarcinoma.\r"

Levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were determined with the women in a sitting position 3 days before the test and in the left lateral recumbent position immediately before and after the test. Levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were not influenced by parity or salt intake. They were found to be significantly higher in the left lateral recumbent position than in the sitting position. There was also a significant increase in atrial natriuretic peptide levels during angiotensin II infusion. A dose of angiotensin II less than 1.5 ng/kg/min did not affect atrial natriuretic peptide levels. Rise in atrial natriuretic peptide levels was minimally correlated with rise in mean arterial pressure, as caused by acute vasoconstriction from angiotensin II infusion. Therefore it is suggested that, in pregnancy, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide to angiotensin II is mediated not only by changes in blood pressure but also by angiotensinergic receptor activity in the atria.\r"

The presence or absence of the individual fetal biophysical activities (fetal heart rate reactivity, fetal breathing movements, fetal body movements, and fetal tone) were correlated with umbilical cord blood gas and acid-base measurements (artery and vein). Fetuses with nonreactive nonstress test results or the absence of breathing had significantly lower cord artery pH, PO2 bicarbonate, and base excess measurements but not a significantly different PCO2 level as compared with fetuses that had these activities present. Fetuses with the absence of movements or tone had lower pH, PO2 bicarbonate, and base excess levels and higher PCO2 levels as compared with fetuses with the presence of movements or tone, respectively. These blood gas and acid-base differences were observed in both umbilical cord artery and vein. Subsequent analysis of the blood gas and acid-base measurements of the fetuses with compromised biophysical activities revealed that there are different levels of acidemia, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia at which the individual biophysical activities are compromised. These data suggest that the first manifestations of fetal hypoxemia and acidemia are nonreactive nonstress test results and loss of fetal breathing; in advanced acidemia, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia fetal movements and fetal tone are compromised.\r"

Studies were conducted in 8 conscious dogs instrumented for the measurement of left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) flow, subendocardial segment lengths in areas perfused by the LCCA, and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Brief, repeated LCCA occlusions sufficiently developed collateral vessels for the resting metabolic requirement in the LCCA region. One week following the cessation of repeated LCCA occlusions, two-minute coronary occlusions with and without drug pretreatment were performed on separate days. The ischemic responses to coronary occlusions were not altered by diltiazem (50 micrograms/kg, IV), but nitroglycerin (5 micrograms/kg, IV) attenuated myocardial ischemia definitely. The authors conclude that nitroglycerin produces greater effects than diltiazem in attenuating myocardial ischemia in the collateral dependent zone when effects of each drug on systemic and coronary circulation were minimized by pretreatment with small doses.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanisms responsible for oxygen-induced hypercarbia in ventilator-dependent patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To quantitate the effects of oxygen (O2) on respiratory drive, we determined the CO2 recruitment threshold (PCO2 RT) in 10 mechanically ventilated patients under normoxic (PaO2 = 67 +/- 7 mm Hg) and hyperoxic (PaO2 = 370 +/- 67 mm Hg) conditions. PCO2 RT is a measure of the CO2 responsiveness of the mechanically unloaded respiratory system and, as such, is independent of mechanical impedance and respiratory muscle strength. After O2 supplementation, PCO2 RT increased from 42 +/- 6 to 45 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05), indicating a suppression of so-called hypoxic respiratory drive. The effect of hyperoxia on the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and CO2 elimination (VCO2) was studied in 6 patients. Measurements were made at identical ventilator settings, thus eliminating breathing pattern- and respiratory work-related effects on these variables. VD/VT rose from 0.49 +/- 0.09 to 0.55 +/- 0.06 (p less than or equal to 0.05), but VCO2 remained constant at 0.21 L/min. We discuss why measuring O2-induced changes in minute ventilation, VCO2, PaO2, and VD/VT in spontaneously breathing patients is insufficient to distinguish between gas exchange- and respiratory drive-related mechanisms for hypercarbia. Based on the O2-induced increase in PCO2 RT, we conclude that so-called suppression of hypoxic drive plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

SETTING: The blood-transmitted viruses unit and the liver unit of a university teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: A total of 250 patients who had open heart surgery and their 3142 blood donors. MEASUREMENTS: Donor sera were tested for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, in the event of a positive result, by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Antibodies to anti-HBc and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were also measured. Measurements of anti-HCV and ALT activity in recipients were done before transfusion and at regular intervals during follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 250 transfusion recipients, 40 developed non-A, non-B hepatitis. Of the 3142 donors, 70 were positive for anti-HCV by ELISA, 440 were positive for anti-HBc, and 177 had alanine aminotransferase levels between 0.67 and 1.33 mukat/L. The sensitivity (87%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (59%), and negative predictive value (97%) of blood-donor screening were higher for anti-HCV than for anti-HBc (82%, 36%, 21%, and 91%, respectively) and 70%, 29%, and 91%, respectively). The expected number of donors excluded because of the presence of anti-HCV was considerably smaller than that of donors with positive results for surrogate markers of hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Screening blood donors for the presence of anti-HCV is more accurate than screening for surrogate markers (anti-HBc and ALT) and protects more effectively against post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "In an unprecedented approach to viral discovery, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was cloned before it was established by conventional methods of viral detection or by genomic characterization. Hepatitis C virus is a small (10-kb), single-stranded RNA virus with a genomic organization that places it in the family Flaviviridae. The virus is global in distribution, with a prevalence between 0.3% and 1.5%. The same agent causes parenterally acquired and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Nonparenteral modes of spread are poorly defined, but low-level sexual transmission is probable. There is a strong association between the presence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and hepatocellular carcinoma; a causal role for HCV is suspected but has not been proved. Hepatitis C virus accounts for at least 85% of the cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis; an anti-HCV-reactive donor was retrospectively identified in nearly 90% of cases. Among donors confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) to be anti-HCV positive, 80% to 90% are infectious. Hepatitis C virus RNA can be detected within 1 to 2 weeks of exposure and persists throughout the course of infection. Generally, the presence of anti-HCV cannot be confirmed until 9 to 20 weeks after exposure, creating a window period of seronegativity and potential infectivity. It is anticipated that the anti-HCV assay will reduce the number of cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis by 50% in the United States; a 70% reduction has been documented in Spain.\r"

  ".W": "The response to cerebral hypoxia/ischemia may be different in the neonate compared to other age groups. An in vivo model was developed in the rat to determine whether there are age-dependent differences in the effects of hypoxia on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. EEG recordings were obtained from Long Evans hooded rats deprived of oxygen at five ages: postnatal days 5 to 7, 10 to 12, 15 to 17, 25 to 27, and 50 to 60. Oxygen concentration was varied from 0, 2, 3, and 4% between animals. EEGs were recorded in all animals before, during, and at 1 hour after exposure to the hypoxic condition and at 1 to 7 days afterward in a subset of animals. All animals were deprived of oxygen until the onset of apnea and bradycardia to 20 to 40% of baseline heart rate values. Hypoxia resulted in isoelectric EEG significantly more frequently in the animals deprived of oxygen at postnatal days 25 to 27 and 50 to 60 than in the younger age groups. A highly significant effect was that the animals deprived at postnatal days 5 to 17 revealed a high incidence of epileptiform EEG activity during hypoxia. In contrast, the older animals exhibited only rare isolated EEG spikes before reaching an isoelectric EEG. The severity of hypoxia-induced epileptiform EEG changes was highest in the animals subjected to moderately hypoxic conditions (3% and 4% oxygen) at postnatal days 10 to 12. Furthermore, epileptiform changes persisted for hours to days following prolonged episodes of hypoxia in the younger animals. This study demonstrates a unique response of the immature brain to exhibit epileptiform activity during hypoxia.\r"

Whether other CNS regions are also affected has not been well studied. We report neocortical damage in patients with HIV encephalitis. Using quantitative techniques, we demonstrate statistically significant thinning of the neocortex, with a loss of large cortical neurons. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of neocortical neuropil reveal a loss of synaptic density and vacuolation of dendritic processes. Failure to demonstrate an association of these changes with the presence of HIV antigens suggests that neocortical damage may be an indirect effect of HIV infection of the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize CD8 T-cell activation during HIV-1 infection we measured serum soluble CD8 (sCD8) levels longitudinally in seroconverters and in individuals with established HIV infection who were in different stages of illness. CD8 T-cell activation occurs very early in HIV infection. Serum sCD8 levels were elevated in 91.5% of the first seropositive samples in seroconverters. Furthermore, CD8 T-cell activation persists throughout HIV infection. sCD8 predicted the occurrence of AIDS in HIV-seropositive individuals and so the addition of serum sCD8 levels to CD4 T-cell measurements increased the power in predicting the onset of AIDS. The serum level of sCD8 was particularly relevant to the prediction of subsequent CD4 T-cell fall relatively early in infection, for example, in the 3 years after seroconversion. However, later in HIV infection, for example within 2 years prior to development of AIDS, sCD8 levels were less predictive. sCD8 correlated with levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin, which reflect activation of cell types other than CD8. Thus, serum sCD8 level can be a useful marker of specific CD8 T-cell activation, and is an independent predictor of prognosis in HIV infection.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms accountable for the release of this molecule we evaluated the presence of sCD8 in the supernatants obtained from in vitro cultures of highly purified CD8 cells isolated from 20 HIV-1-infected patients. At resting conditions cultured CD8 cells from HIV-1-infected patients released low amounts of sCD8; no statistically significant differences were observed between unstimulated cultures from HIV-1-seropositive patients and from HIV-1-seronegative subjects at risk for HIV-1 infection or normal healthy controls. Following in vitro activation of highly purified CD8 cells with a series of stimulatory agents, including phorbol myristate acetate, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and recombinant interleukin-2, CD8 cells of HIV-1-infected patients significantly increased the shedding of sCD8. By expressing the results of activation-related release index (ARRI = sCD8 levels detected in the cultures with stimulatory agent/sCD8 levels detected in the unstimulated cultures), significantly higher values were observed upon PHA stimulation in HIV-1-infected patients than in control subjects. In order to identify the cell subset responsible for the enhanced release of sCD8 by PHA-stimulated cultures, we correlated the amounts of sCD8 detected in the supernatants with the phenotypic profile of CD8+ cells recovered from the cultures. A significant relationship was demonstrated between the percentage of CD8+/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes and sCD8 levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous in vitro production of HIV-1-specific antibodies, a hallmark of infected subjects, is often down-regulated by the addition of pokeweed mitogen. We observed that a decrease in such ongoing anti-HIV-1 antibody synthesis could also be induced in cultures from most patients by addition of phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A, but not by Epstein-Barr virus, a selective B-cell mitogen. In most cases, this down-regulatory effect of mitogens was evident within the first 24 h of culture. The observed mitogen-associated decrease in spontaneous antibody synthesis was prevented by treating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with agents inhibiting non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity or by adding third-party cells to the cultures. In most cases, the mitogen-induced effect was also counteracted by removal of T lymphocytes or CD8+ T-cell sub-population. These findings recall a similar phenomenon observed in normal subjects following intentional immunization, and indicate that mitogen-induced down-regulation of spontaneous in vitro anti-HIV-1-antibody production most probably occurs through a lectin-dependent cytotoxic effect on activated B cells.\r"

In the course of performing surgery, perforations are frequently created in surgical gloves, which often go unnoticed. This study determined the frequency with which occult glove perforations occurred in 134 consecutive head and neck surgical procedures. One thousand fifty gloves (650 gloves used in surgery, 400 unused control gloves) were analyzed for the presence of perforations large enough to permit the passage of fluid. An unrecognized glove perforation was detected in 25% of surgical cases. The duration of surgery correlated strongly and positively with the incidence of perforation. Perforation rates varied widely for specific types of procedures, and are reported for each of the five subdivisions within otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. The implications of these results are described, and recommendations for the use of protective measures, especially in reference to the use of double-gloving, are made.\r"

  ".W": "The renal response to changes in hydration includes variation in intracellular sorbitol, a major inner medullary osmolyte. To examine the mechanism for changes in net sorbitol production, we measured activities of enzymes regulating sorbitol production (aldose reductase) and degradation (sorbitol dehydrogenase) in untreated, water diuretic, and antidiuretic (water restriction and/or vasopressin administration) rats. Collecting duct segments dissected from collagenase-treated kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into outer medullary and three distinct inner medullary regions. Aldose reductase activity increased during antidiuresis and decreased during diuresis. In contrast, sorbitol dehydrogenase activity was very low during antidiuresis and increased during diuresis. These changes in enzyme activity were found after 3 days, but not after 1 day, of water diuresis/antidiuresis. Enzyme activity changed only in the deepest 50% of the inner medullary collecting duct. Thus, there is coordinated regulation of aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities so that (a) during water diuresis, aldose reductase activity decreases while sorbitol dehydrogenase activity increases; and (b) during antidiuresis (water restriction and/or vasopressin administration), aldose reductase activity increases while sorbitol dehydrogenase activity remains low. We conclude that long-term osmoregulation in response to physiologic stimuli involves both aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities in rat terminal inner medullary collecting duct segments.\r"

Experimental conditions selected for study were acute (60-min) and chronic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), acute acetazolamide, acute and chronic furosemide, and 14 days of varied intake of dietary sodium. The density of the binding of 3H-metolazone was increased 47% by acute HCTZ (P less than 0.001) and 39% (P less than 0.001) by acute furosemide. In contrast, acute acetazolamide produced no change in binding despite eliciting a dramatic diuresis. Chronic HCTZ (5 days) and chronic furosemide (7 days) increased binding of 3H-metolazone by 46% (P less than 0.001) and by 101% (P less than 0.001), respectively. Variation of dietary sodium intake over a range that allowed normal growth of the animal and that produced urinary excretion of Na varying from 0.28 to 2.62 mEq/100 g/day failed to alter the density of binding of 3H-metolazone. These studies are the first indication that the density of the thiazide receptor is regulated by a variety of both acute and chronic conditions that have previously been associated with changes in transport, ultrastructure or Na-K-ATPase activity in the distal nephron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative content and intracellular distribution of carbonic anhydrase II in the various subpopulations of intercalated cells in the rat collecting duct. A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against mouse erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase II was employed to localize carbonic anhydrase, II by light and electron microscopy by an indirect immunoperoxidase method. A Western immunoblot analysis of homogenates of rat kidney cortex and medulla with the carbonic anhydrase II antibody revealed a single polypeptide band at 29 kDa corresponding to the molecular size of carbonic anhydrase II. By both light and electron microscopy, carbonic anhydrase II immunoreactivity was present in all intercalated cells but the intensity of staining was much greater in type A than in type B cells. In addition, immunostaining in type A cells was especially pronounced in the apical cytoplasm and apical microprojections whereas in type B cells, immunostaining was more diffuse throughout the cytoplasm. A third configuration of intercalated cell with diffuse immunostaining for carbonic anhydrase II was occasionally observed in the connecting segment. Very weak immunostaining was present in principal cells, whereas connecting tubule cells and inner medullary collecting duct cells were negative for carbonic anhydrase II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No discrete rearranged bands (DRB) were detected in patients with inflammatory dermatoses. In tissue DNA from 19 patients with MF DRB were detected with beta and gamma, but not delta TCR probes. Only one patient with MF had a rearrangement of gamma and delta with germ line beta TCR genes. In 13 patients multiple biopsies were analyzed and DRB, when present, were identical in different lesions from individual patients. In three patients analysis of DNA from dermatopathic lymph nodes did not reveal DRB. Analysis of peripheral blood DNA from 24 patients revealed a discrete rearrangement of the gamma TCR gene in four patients and both beta and gamma genes in four additional patients. In MF DRB were detected more frequently with advancing stage of disease in tissues (P less than 0.01) but not in peripheral blood (P equals 0.36). Of 14 patients with Sezary syndrome, eight had DRB in peripheral blood DNA with both beta and gamma probes and in three of these patients identical DRB were also detected in DNA from skin biopsy samples. In contrast, DRB were not detected in the peripheral blood of the other six patients. In both MF and Sezary syndrome there was no restricted usage of particular V gamma genes. These results indicate that in MF (1) T-cell clones can be detected in skin biopsy specimens from the majority of patients with early stage disease, (2) gamma delta T-cell clones are only rarely found, and (3) TCR gene analysis can detect T-cell clones in the peripheral blood with a greater degree of specificity than conventional light microscopic study. In Sezary syndrome these studies also suggest that a subset of patients have a polyclonal population of circulating atypical lymphoid cells. In addition these patients appear to have a better prognosis than those with monoclonal disease.\r"

Serum levels of alpha-IFN, gamma-IFN, and IL-2 were significantly depressed in alcoholic cirrhotics, with no significant differences between the different degrees of hepatic damage. The results suggest a profound alteration in the immune system of alcoholic cirrhotics, which may contribute to the development of the disease and the accompanying immune system deficit.\r"

The mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) dropped from 155 +/- 91 (SD) to 69 +/- 72 during interferon treatment, but remained unchanged (158 +/- 140 to 147 +/- 130) during placebo treatment (P less than 0.001). Serum ALT level fell to the normal range in 29% of interferon-treated patients, but in only 4% of placebo-treated patients. Pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies were obtained in all but one case. Average histological activity indices (HAI) were markedly improved in the interferon-treated group (9.5 +/- 3.7 to 7.0 +/- 4.3), but were unchanged in the placebo group (8.5 +/- 4.3 to 8.5 +/- 4.9). In addition, we compared the efficacy of interferon treatment between anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and negative groups. Biochemical and histological improvements were similar and statistically significant in patients with and without antibody to hepatitis C virus. These data indicate that a eight-week course of alpha-interferon induces biochemical and histological improvement in more than half the patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

DESIGN: We studied pituitary hormone responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in 10 women with simple weight loss amenorrhea. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, University of Tokushima at Tokushima, Japan. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss who did not have anorexia nervosa. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous injection of 500 micrograms of synthetic TRH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyrotropin, and prolactin were measured before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after TRH injection. RESULTS: In normally menstruating women on day 7 of the cycle TRH did not affect serum LH and FSH levels. In women with simple weight loss amenorrhea, however, TRH raised serum LH and FSH levels significantly (P less than 0.01, respectively). Prolactin response to TRH was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea than in normally menstruating women. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TRH causes a significant rise in serum LH and FSH and the impaired prolactin response in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea.\r"

DESIGN: Pulses of LH-RH were given intravenously during 1 week with intervals of 90 (n = 5) or 120 minutes (n = 5). Before, during, and after treatment serial plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) patterns and pituitary responsiveness to LH-RH were estimated. PATIENTS: Women with virtual absence of gonadal function (postmenopause, gonadal dysgenesis, and premature menopause). RESULTS: During treatment with the 90-minute interval, no LH pulses that were not related to injections of LH-RH were observed. Two spontaneous LH pulses were observed during treatment with the 120-minute interval. Immediately after treatment, a lowered incidence of spontaneous LH pulses was seen of 3 pulses/6 h if LH-RH had been given every 90 minutes and to 1.5 pulses/6 h after the 120-minute interval treatment. Gonadotropin responses to 100 micrograms of LH-RH were attenuated during treatment but recovered within 48 hours after discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Exogenously administered LH-RH can override endogenous LH-RH or its effects on the release of LH in women with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism; (2) during pulsatile LH-RH treatment desensitization of the pituitary occurs to some degree; and (3) immediately after cessation of treatment with pulsatile LH-RH, spontaneous LH pulses are present but with a significantly lower incidence.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective series of IVF patients undergoing pituitary desensitization and ovarian suppression before beginning controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF-ET. SETTING: Tertiary infertility practice. PATIENTS: Seventy-eight women for 80 cycles began LA on day 1 of their menstrual cycle. After 11 days of LA, 47 (59%) cycles in group I had suppressed serum estradiol (E2) levels less than 40 pg/mL, in contrast to 33 (41%) cycles in group II not adequately suppressed, thereby requiring additional days to achieve suppression. INTERVENTIONS: Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was started when patients were satisfactorily suppressed, i.e., E2 less than 40 pg/mL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mean E2 response, ampules of human menopausal gonadotropin, cancellation rates, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, and pregnancy rates (PRs) per cycle were examined between groups I and II. RESULTS: Group I demonstrated a greater mean E2 response on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin 1,735 pg/mL versus 1,470 pg/mL (P = 0.008), a greater fertilization rate 64% versus 55% (P = 0.02), and a higher PR per cycle 34% versus 12% (P = 0.036) compared with group II. CONCLUSIONS: Women who achieved desensitization-suppression within 11 days of initiating LA demonstrated a more favorable outcome for IVF-ET than those who did not.\r"

PATIENTS: One hundred fifty-seven women were randomized to receive either hMG alone or the GnRH-a buserelin acetate 600 microgram/d or buserelin acetate 1,200 microgram/d plus hMG. RESULTS: Compared with hMG alone, pretreatment with buserelin acetate significantly increased the PR per cycle started by preventing a premature luteinizing hormone rise and thereby reducing the number of abandoned cycles. There was, however, no difference between the number of follicles aspirated, oocytes obtained, or fertilization rates between groups. Furthermore, agonist therapy significantly increased both the dose of hMG required and the duration of stimulation.

Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology.\r"

The study also suggests, however, that personal bonds may be problematic for both workers and clients. For workers there is the risk of exploitation; for clients, there is the potential for loss of control over their own care. The quality of relationships also affects quality of care.\r"

There are four currently available agents approved for use in treatment of myocardial infarction: streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, and anistreplase. Although each of these agents works in a unique fashion, the common end point of therapy is the dissolution of a fibrin clot by the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. A number of clinically measurable end points have been used to determine the effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, including mortality, reperfusion, patency, left ventricular function, left ventricular volumes, and quantitative creatine kinase isoenzyme analysis. Secondary end points have included bleeding and stroke, as well as recurrent ischemic events. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of all of these agents in achieving the desired end points and comparative studies, including several large-scale trials, have failed to differentiate among these agents with regard to efficacy. Newer dosing regimens for currently available thrombolytic agents, as well as new thrombolytic agents, are currently under active investigation and will be the subject of intense research over the next few years. Despite the lack of consensus as to which agent is superior, it is clear that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is the treatment of choice.\r"

We conclude that the severity of neurological involvement at the craniovertebral junction was determined by soft-tissue changes, not by the type of odontoid dysplasia nor by subluxation. Posterior occipitocervical fusion proved to be an effective treatment.\r"

To determine the exact role played by these two electrophysiologic effects in the termination of reentry, the effects of disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone and E-4031, a new class III drug, were examined in a canine model of atrial flutter (cycle length 120 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 3 ms) caused by reentry. Atrial flutter was induced in 32 anesthetized open chest dogs after placement of an intercaval crush. The excitable gap ranged from 9 +/- 2% to 11 +/- 4% of the basic flutter cycle length. The effective refractory period in the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter was estimated by subtracting the excitable gap from the basic flutter cycle length. Prolongation of flutter cycle length by the test drugs was proportional to the interatrial conduction time (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). Atrial flutter was terminated by each test drug in all dogs except for flecainide and propafenone in one dog each. E-4031 prolonged the refractory period during atrial flutter to 129 +/- 6 ms, which did not differ significantly from the flutter cycle length immediately before termination (134 +/- 4 ms). The refractory period during atrial flutter after injection of the other drugs was shorter than the flutter cycle length before termination of atrial flutter (for example, flecainide 126 +/- 5 vs. 179 +/- 11 ms, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with AIDS in AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 002 were treated with either low or high dosages of zidovudine. This resulted in moderate, transient increases by 10 and 20 weeks in lymphocyte blastogenesis and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in vitro in response to phytohemagglutinin with and without recombinant interleukin-2. Immune responses to cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were augmented less frequently during therapy. Natural killer (NK) cell lysis of uninfected and human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells was also transiently increased by 10 and 20 weeks. IFN-gamma production, the only immune parameter directly associated with increases in numbers of CD4+ T cells, peaked at 10 weeks of treatment. The limited efficacy of zidovudine treatment in AIDS patients is associated with moderate, temporary increases in nonspecific and herpesvirus-specific T lymphocyte responses and NK cell function.\r"

Zidovudine (AZT, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), didanosine (ddI, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were evaluated in two-drug regimens against replication of AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro. AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant isolate pairs derived from two individuals before and after extended AZT monotherapy were studied. Drug interactions using peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1 were evaluated mathematically. Synergistic interactions were seen among AZT, ddI, and rIFN-alpha A in two-drug regimens against AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro, even when AZT was included in the treatment regimen. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant reverse transcriptase genes were found in one of the late-AZT therapy isolates, suggesting that the mechanism of synergy of AZT-containing regimens may involve inhibition of AZT-sensitive viruses in the viral pool. These studies suggest that AZT may be useful in drug combination regimens, even when AZT-resistant viruses are isolated in vitro.\r"

Anti-CCHF virus IgG was found in 13.1% of 283 persons who completed a standard questionnaire and provided blood samples. Seropositivity rates were similar between sexes and increased significantly with age among nomadic persons. Behavior patterns providing exposure to multifactorial risk factors were gender-based. Male risk factors, primarily associated with herding activities, included sleeping outside during seasonal migrations (also a risk factor for nomadic women), bite by a tick (adult male Hyalomma truncatum), tick bite during the cool dry season, and contact with sick animals. Human infection of CCHF occurred more frequently or with less mortality in the region studied than has been found elsewhere in Africa; however, the rate of seroconversion-associated illness is undetermined. Hyalomma ticks appear to be the primary transmission mode.\r"

Results were compared with data from cell and plasma cultures, plasma p24 antigen, CD4 cell counts, and stage of disease. PEG precipitation increased the detection rate of the p24 antigen assay from 38.3% to 58.7%. There was a significant correlation between precipitable p24 antigen and plasma viremia, changes in CD4 cell counts, and progression of disease. The sensitivity of the PEG-precipitable p24 antigen assay versus traditional p24 antigen testing was 59.0% and the specificity 91.7%. The assay was reproducible and may be a useful determinant of viral load, clinical progression, and antiretroviral efficacy.\r"

Cell-free HIV RNA was more likely to be present in the semen of men with less than 400 than in those with greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm3 (P less than .04) and was present in all patient with p24 antigen in serum. The presence of HIV DNA in NSMC samples was not related to CD4 cell count, disease status, or the presence of p24 antigen in the serum.

The data for 16 patients showed an unexpectedly high level of variation in cCa2+ (range, 1.01-1.25 mmol l-1) despite the fact that there was only a small degree of variability in pH (range, 7.38-7.51). cCa2+ was not correlated with pH as has been observed in acute respiratory disturbances. A highly significant negative correlation was found between cCa2+ and base excess (BE) (r = -0.81, P less than 0.0001), and between cCa2+ and carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) (r = 0.71, P less than 0.002). These correlations differed from those reported previously in acute respiratory disturbances. CCa2+ showed a significant positive correlation with oxygen tension (PO2) (r = 0.71, P less than 0.002). It is concluded that cCa2+ in arterial blood from patients with chronic lung disease is correlated with acid-base and gas quantities in an entirely different manner to that observed in acute acid-base disturbances in normal adults.\r"

There was no consistent alteration in the APP differential expression among beta plaque (-), (+), and (++(-) ) groups. Also, no differences in the four-repeat tau ratios were noted among tangle (-), (+), and (++) groups. Despite these great individual variabilities, APP-751 was found to be well-correlated with four-repeat tau.

  ".W": "Neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins are normally poorly phosphorylated in neuronal perikarya, the two high molecular weight polypeptides becoming extensively phosphorylated once the NF enters the axon. Abnormal expression of phosphorylated NF (pNF) epitopes in neuronal perikarya has been revealed using monoclonal antibodies in a variety of human and experimental conditions. In the present study, we asked whether pNF epitopes are expressed in sensory neurons in the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following blockade of fast axonal transport in a model producing few (less than 1%) degenerating fibers. Colchicine (5 mM) was briefly (45 minutes) applied to the sciatic nerve at mid-thigh twice (once weekly) and the animals studied two weeks following the first colchicine application; contralateral nerves were either treated with saline or crushed. Modest to intense immunoreactivity was found with antibody 07-05 (directed against pNF epitopes on the two high molecular weight NF polypeptides) in 30.4% and 45.1% of DRG neurons from colchicine-treated and crushed nerves, respectively; only a rare cell body demonstrated immunostaining from the contralateral saline-treated nerves. Immunoreactivity was not observed with antibody 07-05 at two and five days following single colchicine application. In a separate study, colchicine or saline was applied (as above) 1-2 cm proximal to a nerve crush. Colchicine application did not influence the extent of DRG neurons expressing pNF epitopes; immunostaining with antibody 07-05 was present in 44.7% and 43.8% of DRG neurons from saline-treated and colchicine-treated crushed nerves, respectively. The results indicate that structural interruption of nerve-target contact is not necessary to induce aberrant NF phosphorylation in neuronal perikarya. It is suggested that loss of a retrogradely transported \"trophic\" signal(s) triggers this response.\r"

  ".W": "Neurofilaments (NF) are normally poorly phosphorylated in neuronal perikarya and highly phosphorylated in axons. Aberrant NF phosphorylation in the neuronal perikaryon has been demonstrated in a number of human and experimental disorders. In this study, we have asked whether expression of these phosphorylated NF (pNF) epitopes is dependent upon continued axonal regeneration following nerve transection (axotomy). This hypothesis was tested using the neurotoxic chemical acrylamide (AC) which is known to inhibit axonal regeneration following systemic administration. First, we examined whether AC acts at the level of the neuronal perikaryon to inhibit axonal elongation. Systemic, high dose intraperitoneal (IP) AC administration totalling 150 mg/kg (75 mg/kg x 2) did not impair the axotomy-induced reordering of slow axonal transport in the neuronal perikaryon. Next, we studied the ability of AC to directly prevent nerve outgrowth at the growing tips of axons. Subperineurial injection of AC (0.1 M), which in preliminary studies was found not to produce nerve fiber damage, markedly reduced the extent of nerve outgrowth when injected proximal to a nerve crush; this was shown by a reduction in the extent of radiolabeling and number of axonal sprouts in the distal stump seven days following nerve crush. Using this protocol, a 67% decrease in the number of neuronal perikarya in the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia demonstrating immunoreactivity to antibody 07-05 (directed against pNF epitopes) was observed in AC-injected compared to contralateral saline-injected crushed nerves. Taken together, the results indicate that inhibition of axonal regeneration in the distal stump by AC reduces aberrant NF phosphorylation in the neuronal perikaryon following axotomy.\r"

Furthermore, HIV Ag changes did not differ among all lengths of observation (from 1 to 5 months using all possible pairwise combinations of HIV Ag levels, p greater than 0.4). CD4 T-cell changes over the whole study did not correlate with HIV Ag changes over the same period. Knowledge of this broad HIV Ag variability should be useful in calculating sample size and in choosing categorical responses unlikely to occur spontaneously in clinical trials of antiviral agents where HIV Ag changes are used as surrogate markers of efficacy.\r"

The prevalence of HIV-1 antibodies in the malnourished group was 25.5% (51 of 200) compared with 1.5% (three of 200) in the controls. The seroprevalence rate was equally high in malnourished children above the age of 18 months (26 of 102; 25.5%), as in those below this age (25 of 98; 25.5%). The prevalence rate was higher in children with marasmus (38.2%) as compared to children with marasmic-kwashiorkor (12.3%) or kwashiorkor (12.2%). The prevalence of clinical features known to be associated with AIDS was higher in the HIV seropositive malnourished children as compared to the seronegative children. The modified World Health Organization clinical case definition of AIDS in children was also evaluated and found to have a low sensitivity and positive predictive value (62.8 and 57.1%, respectively) but a fairly high specificity (83.9%). It is recommended to routinely rule out HIV infection in malnourished children, especially those with marasmus.\r"

  ".W": "Testicular function was studied in 22 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with serum measurements of hormone levels, seminal fluid analysis and testicular reserve test. Results were correlated with disease activity. The abnormal findings were elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), inversion of estradiol/testosterone ratio (E2:T) and diminished testicular reserve for testosterone (T) and slightly increased for estradiol (E2). Nine patients with severe active AS received biweekly 2,500 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin injections with a resulting increase in E2 serum levels. When the values of E2 reached 40 pg/ml or higher, there was a decrease of the sedimentation rate (p less than 0.05) and a reversal to normal of the E2:T ratio. This was accompanied by an improvement in AS at the 10th week that lasted up to 9 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Our findings suggest a possible role of sex hormones in the physiopathogenesis of AS and offers a possible therapeutic alternative.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of abdominal surgery on protein, RNA, and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes, and modification of these changes by postoperative amino acid supply, were investigated in 24 patients undergoing cholecystectomy (n = 12) or removal of gastric cancer (n = 12). Mono-nuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood and incubated with radioactive tracers in vitro. Protein and RNA synthesis, as measured using [14C] glycine and [3H]uridine, respectively, increased postoperatively. Nucleotide synthesis determined by the incorporation of radioactivity from [14C] glycine into nucleotides increased simultaneously. The concentration of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) estimated by the incorporation of [14C]adenine into nucleotides also increased. These changes were greater and of longer duration in patients with cancer operation than in those with cholecystectomy. In neither case were they affected by the amount of amino acid intake, or increases in energy intake. These results suggest that abdominal surgery stimulates protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in lymphocytes. Increased RNA synthesis may be ensured by increased synthesis of nucleotides, and increased PRPP concentrations appear to regulate the rate of nucleotide synthesis. The responses are apparently dependent upon the severity of surgery, but unrelated to the amount of amino acid supplied postoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two patients undergoing bowel resection were randomized to receive either immediate postoperative nasojejunal feeding with full strength Osmolite solution for 56 hours (n = 16) or routine postoperative hypocaloric fluids and gradual reintroduction of diet (n = 16). Body composition changes were measured at 14 days after operation with in vivo neutron activation analysis, the wound healing response by subcutaneous implantation of Gortex tubes, and muscle function by grip strength, maximum ventilatory volume, and stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. Postoperative fatigue up to 3 months after operation was assessed using a 10-point analogue. Successful immediate enteral nutrition was established in 12 of the 16 patients. Enterally fed patients had a mean daily caloric intake of 1179 +/- 388 kcal/d (mean +/- SD) over the first 4 postoperative days compared with 382 +/- 71 kcal/d for the controls (p less than 0.0001). The amount of hydroxyproline accumulating in the Gortex tubes was also significantly greater (2.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/g tube vs 1.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/g tube; p less than 0.02). However, the amount and composition of the weight lost was not significantly different. Muscle function was not preserved, and postoperative fatigue occurred to an equal extent in both groups. Complications were similar in both groups, except for a preponderance of bowel obstructions in the controls. The time to passage of first flatus and first bowel motion, although shorter in the fed group, did not reach significance (p = 0.07). We conclude that immediate enteral nutrition is feasible and results in an improved wound healing response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations.\r"

Factors which might affect nutritional status including method of feeding, energy prescribed, use of supplemental feedings, assistance in eating, and amount of diet consumed were recorded. Confounding variables including illness, mental status, functional status, or prescription drugs were evaluated for their impact. On the basis of an empiric nutrition score, 54% of newly admitted residents were malnourished. Improvement in nutritional score occurred in 63% of malnourished patients remaining in the facility whereas 37% remained malnourished. Two related factors, percentage of diet consumed and degree of assistance required in eating, were important differences in the outcome of patients remaining malnourished. Interventional studies to determine whether outcome can be improved by more aggressive feeding methods or by feeding teams need to be undertaken.\r"

Rats in all groups were fed for 7 days with regular rat chow. After fasting for 12 hours, 14C-labeled fat emulsion was infused to the JE and CE, and 14C-labeled unemulsified fat to the JU and CU groups through a gastrostomy for the absorption test. The hourly and cumulative output of 14CO2 by respiration, absorption rate of 14C-labeled fat in the intestine, and metabolic oxidation rate of the absorbed fat were determined during an 8-hour period after the gastroenteral administration of emulsified or unemulsified fat. The peak of hourly output was seen after the first 2 hours in the CE, JE, and CU groups, following which a remarkable decline was seen in the CE and CU groups. However, a more gentle descent in the JE, and fluctuation at a low level in the JU group were observed. The cumulative output in the JE was 61% of that in the CE, while the output in the JU was 16% of that in the CU group. The absorption rate in the JE was 81% of that in the CE group, while the rate in the JU was 22% of that in the Cu group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When all three nutrients or glucose alone (68% REE) were given, subjects decreased daily voluntary food intake within 24 to 48 hr by an amount that closely compensated for the infused calories. Intake was reduced by only 20% to 40% of the infused calories when fat alone (68% REE) was given. There were no significant effects when the lower levels of glucose and fat were given. These data suggest the presence of a postabsorptive control of food intake in humans that is sensitive to the circulating supply of fuels.\r"

This study evaluated the hypothesis that glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition would enhance the strength of a standard colonic anastomosis in undernourished rats. After surgery, the rats were randomized to receive 6 days of postoperative support with either rat chow, conventional parenteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition containing 1.2% glutamine. Measurement of colonic bursting tension failed to demonstrate any significant differences between the groups under study.

The balance of NPC were provided as dextrose (Dex) or 50% xylitol:50% dextrose (Xyl/Dex). Rectus muscle and liver fractional protein synthetic rates (FSR, %/day), whole body leucine appearance (Flux), oxidation (OX), protein breakdown (PB), and synthesis (PS) were estimated using a 4-hour iv infusion of [1-14C]leucine on day 3. Mean values (+/- SE) for leucine kinetics (mumol leucine/hr/100 g), cumulative nitrogen balance (mg N) and plasma insulin concentration (Table I). (microU/mL). The partial replacement of dextrose calories with xylitol did not significantly alter whole body and tissue leucine kinetics, daily and cumulative nitrogen balance, insulin concentration, and energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry). These data indicate that xylitol may be useful as an alternative carbohydrate calorie source in parenteral nutrition to avoid possible deleterious side effects of glucose overfeeding in the critically ill but did not improve protein metabolism under the conditions of this study.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of dietary fiber in maintaining optimum bowel function has been shown in feeding studies, and many enteral formulas now contain dietary fiber, usually as soy polysaccharide (SP). Generally only total dietary fiber (TDF) values are given on the label or in product literature, with no indication of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and soluble dietary fiber (SDF) content. Often product literature highlights the amount of SP contained in the formula, not the TDF. The method used to determine TDF content usually is not specified, making it impossible to compare products on a TDF basis. We compared the dietary fiber content of commercially available enteral formulas objectively to help clinicians make informed choices when selecting fiber-containing formulas. Fiber-containing formulas by suppliers were freeze-dried and total, water-soluble, and water-insoluble dietary fiber measured by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) approved method. TDF per 1000 mL ranged from 4.0 to 9.9 g for blenderized formulas and from 7.2 to 20.3 g in formulas containing SP. IDF values per 1000 mL ranged from 2.0 to 5.4 g for blenderized product, and the soy formulas ranged from 5.5 to 16.9 g. SDF values per 1000 mL ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 g in blenderized products, and in soy formulas SDF ranged from 1.7 to 3.8 g. Differences in physiological effects of fiber-containing enteral formulas may be because of differences in fiber composition.\r"

  ".W": "In order to better ascertain its possible use as an alternative fuel substrate in total parenteral nutrition, sebacate (Sb) metabolism was studied in seven overnight-fasting healthy male volunteers, who received a constant iv infusion (99 mmoles over 8 hours) of disodium sebacate. Sb oxidation rate was determined using an isotopic sebacate (disodic salt of (1-10)14C-sebacic acid) infusion (100 mu Ci from the fourth to the eighth hour of the cold sebacate infusion). Blood samples were collected during and after sebacate infusion at intervals of 30 minutes and Sb serum concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Excreted radioactivity (mu Ci/min) was measured by bubbling the expired air into an apparatus containing 3 mEq hyamine to trap CO2 from a 20-L Douglas-bag. CO2 production and O2 consumption were measured before and at 4 and 8 hours after starting the infusion. Twenty-four hour nitrogen excretion with urine was obtained. The RQ and the percent of calories derived from lipid oxidation were calculated by indirect calorimetry. The Sb serum level at the plateau phase was (mean +/- SD) 4.54 +/- 0.71 mumole/mL, the overall rate of tissue uptake was 180.89 +/- 4.50 mumole/min, and the percent oxidation was 6.14 +/- 0.44%. At the end of Sb infusion the RQ dropped to 0.839 +/- 0.043, the percent of calories due to sebacate oxidation was 1.59 +/- 0.52%, and the calories derived from lipids increased to 37.77 +/- 12.90%. These data show that a definite amount of the sebacate infused is oxidized in human tissues.\r"

One hundred children received 130 silastic catheters placed for a total of 17,861 days. Each catheter survived a median of 100 days. Thirty-one episodes of catheter sepsis were identified (one episode for each 576 days of catheter use). Children under 2 years of age had more than two times the risk of catheter infection (p less than 0.01). Children with malabsorption had a greater risk (45.7%) than did those with infection (25.0%) or cancer (15.5%). The use of catheters for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or for multiple purposes markedly increased the risk of catheter infection. The risk of infection of TCVC appears to be great in the young child, in particular, in those requiring TPN or multiple intravenous infusions. Use of TCVC in these children should be avoided if possible.\r"

In view of the reported favorable utilization of high-concentration branch-chain amino acids (BCAA) following severe stress, we compared enteral (TEN) to parenteral (TPN) nutrient infusions containing increased BCAA starting the day of operation. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats, in two groups paired by weight under IP pentobarbital anesthesia underwent jugular vein catheter (CVP) insertion, laparotomy, gastrostomy, colon anastomosis, dorsal skin incision and SC polyvinyl alcohol sponge insertion. The rats were maintained for 6 days with continuous IV infusion in the TPN group (gastrostomy plugged) and continuous gastric infusion for the TEN group (CVP plugged). Urine and feces were collected daily. The infusions contained 1000 to 1002 Kcal, 847 to 845 nonprotein Kcal, 38 to 39 g of amino acids, 206 to 209 g of carbohydrates, and 2.8 to 2.9 g of rat per liter in the TEN and TPN, respectively, with identical ratios of dietary essential amino acids to nonessential amino acids (52/48), and 28.34% BCAA in the TPN and 33.10% BCAA in the TEN. There were 491 mg/100 mL of glutamine in the TEN and 170 mg of glutamic acid in the TPN. Amino acids were infused at 8.59 g/kg per day for TEN and 8.34 g/kg per day for TPN. The vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals were essentially the same in the TEN and TPN except for the absence of iron, iodine, selenium, and molybdenum in the TPN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, a systematic comparative in vitro assessment of the therapeutic potential and safety of these substances has not yet been provided. We investigated the stability of TPN solutions containing calcium-gluconate and glycero- or glucose-phosphate in high concentrations. Evaluation was performed by visual inspection, absorptiometry, light microscopy, measurement of pH, and determination of calcium concentration before and after microfiltration. Even under circumstances promoting precipitation of calcium and phosphate--such as body temperature, relatively high pH, and concentrations of calcium and phosphorus exceeding those necessary to provide intrauterine accretion rates, all but one of the examined TPN admixtures remained stable. Our data suggest that the use of glycero-phosphate, and particularly glucose-phosphate, together with calcium-gluconate, is an uncomplicated and safe procedure to administer simultaneously high amounts of calcium and phosphorus in TPN of premature infants.\r"

To explore the role of these biochemical abnormalities in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on either a 50% galactose or 50% glucose diet. After two months, galactose fed rats exhibited elevated excretory rates of protein, albumin, and IgG. Blebbing and ballooning of the glomerular epithelial cells were apparent in rats on the galactose supplemented diet. Morphometric evaluation of the glomeruli revealed an increase in the fractional and absolute volume of the glomerular epithelial cells, but glomerular and mesangial volume, basement membrane thickness, and epithelial foot process width were similar on the two diets. Glycation of the glomerular basement membrane was increased in the galactose fed rats. Glomerular micropuncture revealed similar glomerular pressures and flow rates on the two diets. Aldose reductase inhibition had no effect on galactose induced proteinuria. These results suggest that biochemical abnormalities such as protein glycation may be important in the pathogenesis of altered glomerular permselectivity in diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Previous studies have examined the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth factors after ischemia, but the response of genes coding for structural and functional genes has not been scrutinized. Rats were subjected to 40 minutes of renal artery occlusion and 60 minutes to 96 hours of reperfusion. Total RNA was isolated and mRNA for the structural protein actin, the enzymes superoxide dismutase and renin, the proto-oncogene c-fos, the nuclear protein histone H2b, and the putative marker for cell injury TRPM-2 was quantitated by Northern hybridization. Expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos was seen early but for only short duration. Histone gene expression was not markedly increased until 24 hours after ischemia, but remained increased for several days. Renin mRNA was undetectable one hour after ischemia, but was present in normal amounts at 24 and 48 hours. In contrast, superoxide dismutase mRNA was present in decreased amounts 24, 48, and 96 hours after ischemia. TRPM-2 gene expression was greatly increased 24 to 72 hours after ischemia and began decreasing at 96 hours. This selective sequence of gene expression or repression after renal ischemia might maximize the proliferative repair process. This information will be useful for designing therapies to further enhance recovery from acute renal injury.\r"

We studied the urinary procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities in 46 patients with renal disease (26 with IgA nephritis, 13 with other forms of glomerulonephritis and 7 with non-inflammatory kidney disease) and in 15 matched healthy subjects, as possible indicators of the coagulation-fibrinolysis balance in kidney. Procoagulant activity was slightly but not significantly increased in patients with serum creatinine levels higher than 1.5 mg/dl (group II) as compared with patients with normal creatinine (group I) and controls. It was identified as tissue factor by biological criteria (dependence on factor VII). Fibrinolysis studies showed that both plasminogen activator activity and urokinase antigen were significantly lower in group II than in group I patients and controls (P less than 0.0005). Reduced fibrinolytic activity in patients' urine was due to decreased excretion of urokinase since no inhibitor was detected by both fibrin autography and functional assay. No differences were found between patients and controls in plasma fibrinolytic activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and procoagulant activity of blood monocytes. The urinary changes in severe renal disease may reflect an unbalance of the coagulation-fibrinolysis equilibrium in kidney and might be of pathogenetic and clinical relevance.\r"

Isotype specific APA antibodies were measured, using cardiolipin as the antigen, in 76 patients with lupus nephritis. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had elevated IgG APA. Overall, 43% of patients showed raised levels of at least one isotype. In general, APA had specificity for anionic phospholipids. In vitro lupus anticoagulant activity was associated with all three isotypes of APA, but only the IgM isotype correlated with the biological false positive test for syphilis. APA were not associated with thromboses or neurological involvement, and only the IgA isotype correlated with thrombocytopenia. We confirmed an association between the presence of intraglomerular thrombi and serum IgG APA. However, we found no association between APA and renal histological pattern, or long-term renal function. Our data, therefore, do not support a major pathogenetic role for APA in the nephritis of lupus in treated patients.\r"

The influence on thresholds with respect to laser type, stimulation site, surface colour, and stimulus parameters (laser beam diameter and pulse duration) was investigated. Significant differences in thresholds between the four lasers were found on both surfaces; however, no significant differences existed between thresholds on the skin and on the tongue when the same laser was used. The observations imply that wavelength-dependent optical properties of the stimulated tissue influence on threshold determinations. Furthermore, the results indicate that temporal and spatial summation mechanisms may exist for laser induced warmth and pain perceptions. Laser stimulation may be a new tool for the investigation of origin and genesis of various orofacial pain syndromes.\r"

Pulpal blood flow (PBF) before and following lasing was recorded through the intact tooth surface by a laser Doppler flowmeter. CO2 laser irradiation caused an increase in PBF, which was immediate and transient. The PBF increase was higher in a large pulp than in a small pulp, and it was inversely related to the focal spot size. These findings confirm that the dental pulp is thermally affected by CO2 lasing of the tooth surface, however, without extensive pulp coagulation. It is concluded that the effects of laser irradiation on the pulpal microcirculation may be studied in situ by means of the presented methodology.\r"

This paper presents a new technique using near infrared radiation from an Nd:YAG laser in conjunction with surface cooling to induce hyperthermia in a rat tumor model. A CW Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia system was used to induce hyperthermic temperatures in chemically (DMBA) induced rat mammary adenocarcinomas. The laser was interfaced to a computer and a thermometry unit that provided feedback to control the tumor temperature between 43.2-43.5 degrees C. A thermocouple was placed at the base of the tumor and its temperature was used to control laser exposure. All tumors were 10 to 20 mm in diameter. Surface cooling methods investigated included forced air flow from a fan, forced oxygen flow plus an IV drip, and forced moist oxygen flow from a nebulizer. Twelve rat mammary adenocarcinomas have been treated with Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia. In 4 treatments, no surface cooling was employed. In one treatment the surface was cooled using oxygen flow plus IV drip. In 7 treatments the skin was cooled using the nebulizer technique. The nebulization provided the most effective and reproducible surface cooling. Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia delivered in conjunction with nebulizer surface cooling produced efficient heating of rat mammary adenocarcinomas. A mean temperature of 42.1 degrees C was obtained at the base of the tumors while the mean surface temperature was 37.0 degrees C.\r"

It is not known if this relationship arises from a direct antiatherogenic effect of these plasma components or if it is the result of other factors also associated with increases in ApoA-I and HDL levels. Because some strains of mice are susceptible to diet-induced formation of preatherosclerotic fatty streak lesions, and because of available techniques for the genetic manipulation of this organism, the murine system offers a unique setting in which to investigate the process of early atherogenesis. To test the hypothesis that induction of a high plasma concentration of ApoA-I and HDL would inhibit this process, we studied the effects of atherogenic diets on transgenic mice expressing high amounts of human ApoA-I. We report that transgenic mice with high plasma ApoA-I and HDL levels were significantly protected from the development of fatty streak lesions.\r"

Although awdK-pn flies have no apparent phenotype on their own, pn awdK-pn double mutants die as second or third larval instars. The awd locus encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of high-energy phosphate bonds between nucleoside diphosphates and nucleoside triphosphates, which is essential for the normal development of Drosophila. Analysis of the pn locus has suggested that the complementary DNA, TcD37, encodes a putative pn+ product. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of TcD37 and the similarity of its deduced protein product to the catalytic domain of mammalian GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs); GAPs stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras (ref. 6), which are plasma membrane-bound proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that the Drosophila TcD37 protein participates in a biochemical pathway similar to that of Ras and GAPs in mammals and yeast. We propose that the interaction between pn and awd is due to a neomorphic mutation that enhances the ability of AwdK-pn nucleoside diphosphate kinase to induce a regulatory GTPase into a GTP-bound 'on' state, whereas Pn modulates the activity of this GTPase either by switching it to a GDP-bound 'off' state or by interfering with its effector function.\r"

Depolymerization of microtubules results in collapse of vimentin and desmin intermediate filaments to the nucleus where they form a perinuclear cap. Collapse can also be induced by microinjection of antibodies against intermediate filament or microtubule proteins. Thus, two filament systems interact with each other. But the molecules mediating this interaction are unknown. One of the candidates for this role is a microtubule motor kinesin. Recent data showed that kinesin is involved in the plus end-directed movement of the membranous organelles along microtubules such as radial extension of lysosomes in macrophages and centrifugal movement of pigment in melanophores. Here we report that injection of the anti-kinesin antibody into human fibroblasts results in the redistribution of intermediate filaments to a tight perinuclear aggregate but had no effect on the distribution of microtubules. Thus, kinesin is involved not only in organelle movement but also in interaction of the two major cytoskeletal systems, intermediate filaments and microtubules.\r"

This study of mailed computer-generated appointment reminders took place in a setting with patient demographics and practice techniques similar to those of many private pediatric practices. During a 6-month period, 901 appointments that were made more than 7 days prior to the scheduled date were randomly assigned to receive reminder postcards or to serve as controls. The overall broken appointment (no-show) rate was reduced from 19% in the control group to 10% in the reminder group, representing a 48% reduction (P = .0002). The magnitude of reduction of no-shows was similar for appointments scheduled more than 14 days prior to the appointment time (39%) as well as those scheduled more recently (58%). Equivalent results were seen with well-child appointments (47%) as with other visits (50%). Both lower and higher socioeconomic groups demonstrated similar results. The mailed postcards cost $0.20 each and were highly cost effective, generating an estimated $7.50 for each $1 spent during the study. With reductions similar to those found in this study, computer-generated appointment reminders are likely to be cost effective in other practices if current no-show rates are greater than 2% to 4%.\r"

In total, 114 nucleotide substitutions were observed, with neither insertion nor deletion. Sixty-one mutations occurred in the variable-joining region genes (V lambda 1-J lambda 1) and 49 in joining-constant (J lambda 1-C lambda 1) introns. Although frequency decreased with distance from the V lambda 1-J lambda 1 coding region, somatic mutations occurred in the entire J lambda 1-C lambda 1 intron and even in the C lambda 1 region. We found four nucleotide substitutions in C lambda 1 genes, all of which were replacement mutations. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for somatic mutation is operative into the C lambda 1 exons. Nucleotide sequences of rearranged but inactive lambda 2-chain genes from two hybridomas were also examined and compared with those of lambda 1-chain genes. The clustering of replacement mutations in complementarity-determining regions in the inactive lambda 2-chain genes similar to the active lambda 1-chain genes suggested a mechanism that induces somatic mutation preferentially in this region even in the absence of antigenic selection.\r"

Fish hatched from injected eggs were raised to sexual maturity, and the frequency of transgenic founder fish was determined by pair-mating the fish and testing DNA extracted from pools of their 16-hr-old offspring by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then Southern analysis. Eggs injected with one of two different plasmids yielded no transgenic fish, but 7-25% (19 of 115 overall) of the eggs injected with the other plasmid transmitted the injected sequences to their offspring (F1). Of seven lines studied further, all were able to pass the foreign DNA sequences to the next (F2) generation. Inheritance in the F2 generation was Mendelian in the five lines tested. PCR and Southern analysis indicated that the plasmid sequences were present in multiple copies, probably tandemly arranged. Two founder fish carried more than one independent integration of the plasmid sequences. The line studied in more detail was a mosaic carrying two independently segregating copies of the transgene in one germ cell and a third copy in another germ-line precursor cell. The ability to obtain and inject large numbers of zebrafish eggs combined with a high frequency of germ-line integration may be steps toward the goal of being able to perform insertional mutagenesis with this organism.\r"

  ".U": "91376065\r", 
  ".W": "Transgenic mice with a lambda shuttle vector containing a lacI target gene were generated for use as a short-term, in vivo mutagenesis assay. The gene is recovered from the treated mice by exposing mouse genomic DNA to in vitro packaging extracts and plating the rescued phage on agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). Phage with mutations in the lacI gene form blue plaques, whereas phage with a nonmutated lacI form colorless plaques. Spontaneous background mutant rates using this system range from 0.6 x 10(-5) to 1.7 x 10(-5), depending upon tissue analyzed, with germ cells exhibiting less than one-third the background rate of somatic tissue. Treatment of the mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), or cyclophosphamide caused an induction of mutations over background. Recovery of the lacI target for sequence analysis was performed by genetic excision of a plasmid from the phage using partial filamentous phage origins. The predominant mutations identified from untreated and treated populations were base substitutions. Although it has been shown by others that 70% of all spontaneous mutations within the lacI gene, when replicated in Escherichia coli, occur at a hot spot located at bases 620-632, only 1 of 21 spontaneous mutations has been identified in this region in the transgenic mouse system. In addition, 5 of 9 spontaneous transitions analyzed occur at CpG dinucleotides, whereas no transition mutations were identified at the prokaryotic deamination hot spots occurring at dcm sites (CCA/TGG) within the lacI gene. For EtNU, approximately equal amounts of transitions and transversions were observed, contrasting with B[a]P-induced mutations, in which only transversions were obtained. In addition, B[a]P mutagenesis showed a predominance of mutations (81%) involving cytosines and/or guanines, consistent with its known mode of action. The discovery of a spontaneous mutation spectrum different from that of bacterial assays, coupled with the concordance of EtNU and B[a]P base mutations with the known mechanisms of activity for these mutagens, suggests that this transgenic system will be useful as a short-term, in vivo system for mutagen assessment and analysis of mechanisms leading to mutations.\r"

A 21-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to this epitope (amino acid positions 59-79; referred to as Py1) induced a specific T-cell proliferation in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and provided help for the production of antibodies to peptides from the repetitive region, (Gln-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro)n, of the P. yoelii circumsporozoite protein when mice were immunized with the Py1 peptide conjugated to the repetitive peptide. Experiments were then designed to study the in vitro antiparasite efficacy of T cells elicited in vivo by peptide immunization. T-cell activity was evaluated on cultured hepatic stages of P. yoelii. Peptide immunizations led to the preferential activation of CD8+ T cells in BALB/c mice and of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice. Parasite elimination was mediated directly by these cells and did not seem to be dependent on lymphokine secretion. These data suggest that peptide-primed CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells could be cytolytic for the hepatic phase of malaria parasites. The fact that the same peptide could activate different lymphocyte populations, depending on the strain of mouse, highlights the importance of a better understanding of the fine mechanisms behind the immune responses to synthetic peptides being tested for malaria vaccine development.\r"

We report here that Drosophila has a single-copy gene containing the two-motif amino acid sequence pattern that characterizes twitchin and titin. This gene appears to encode projectin, a muscle protein that is thought to play a structural role in asynchronous flight muscle but may have a role like that of twitchin in synchronous muscle. Thus Drosophila appears to be a case where the apparently diverged functions of twitchin and titin are encoded by a single gene.\r"

Dendritic cells compose less than 1% of the circulating leukocytes and are nondividing cells. Highly purified preparations of dendritic cells were obtained using recent advances in cell fractionation. The results of these experiments show that dendritic cells, in contrast to monocytes and T cells, support the active replication of all strains of HIV-1 tested, including T-cell tropic and monocyte/macrophage tropic isolates. The dendritic cell cultures supported much more virus production than did cultures of primary unseparated T cells, CD4+ T cells, and adherent as well as nonadherent monocytes. Replication of HIV-1 in dendritic cells produces no noticeable cytopathic effect nor does it decrease total cell number. The ability of the nonreplicating dendritic cells to support high levels of replication of HIV-1 suggests that this antigen-presenting cell population, which is also capable of supporting clonal T-cell growth, may play a central role in HIV pathogenesis, serving as a source of continued infection of CD4+ T cells and as a reservoir of virus infection.\r"

Homologous recombination of this vector introduces a human gamma 1 constant-region sequence linked to the EMCV leader and a neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene. The resulting cells express a bicistronic mRNA encoding at the 5' end a chimeric murine VDJH-human C gamma 1 heavy chain, followed by neo linked to the internal ribosome binding site provided by the EMCV leader. These homologous recombinants express the chimeric heavy chain at levels equivalent to the heavy chain in the parental hybridoma. This strategy of using an EMCV-neo cassette to obtain efficient selectable marker gene expression has potential application to a range of gene targeting vectors.\r"

To characterize the basic mechanism of couplings between receptor stimulation and subunits of G proteins, we constructed a system consisting of peptide 14 and alpha and beta gamma subunits of Gi-2 in aqueous solution. Peptide 14 significantly increased the rate of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate binding to isolated Gi-2 alpha from 0.50 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE; n = 3) to 0.75 +/- 0.02 mol per mol of Gi-2 alpha per 3 min (n = 3) at 100 microM. In this system, G beta gamma does dependently potentiated the peptide 14 action on Gi-2 alpha; and G beta gamma-induced potentiation reached saturation at a concentration comparable to that of Gi-2 alpha. An antibody specific for the C-terminal decapeptide of Gi-2 alpha reduce peptide 14-stimulated GDP release from Gi-2 to the basal level. This simplified system indicates that (i) the receptor sequence directly interacts with isolated Gi-2 alpha at its C-terminal region and (ii) G beta gamma potentiates the stimulation-G alpha coupling in a stoichiometrical manner for G alpha.\r"

The model was based on structural similarities within the super-family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) protein-coupled neuroreceptors and has seven alpha-helical transmembrane segments that form a central core with a putative ligand-binding site. The space between two residues postulated to be involved in agonist binding, Asp-80 and Asn-390, perfectly accommodated an anti-dopamine molecule. Molecular electrostatic potentials were mainly negative on the synaptic side of the receptor model and around aspartate residues lining the central core and positive in the cytoplasmic domains. The docking of dopamine into a postulated binding site was examined by molecular dynamics simulation. The protonated amino group became oriented toward negatively charged aspartate residues in helix 2 and helix 3, whereas the dopamine molecule fluctuated rapidly between different anti and gauche conformations during the simulation. The receptor model suggests that protonated ligands are attracted to the binding site by electrostatic forces and that protonated agonists may induce conformational changes in the receptor, leading to G-protein activation, by increasing the electrostatic potentials near Asp-80.\r"

  ".W": "The gene segments encoding the beta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor undergo rearrangement in a precise developmental order: a D beta gene segment joins to a J beta gene segment prior to the rearrangement of a V beta gene segment to join the D/J beta fusion. Current evidence suggests that the rearrangement of V beta is restricted to T cells, whereas D-to-J beta rearrangements may occur in both B and T cells. Thus, the T-cell specificity seems to be regulated by the V beta coding region or its 5' flanking sequence. In support of this hypothesis, evidence is provided for thymus-specific factors that bind a highly conserved 10-base-pair (decamer) sequence that is an essential promoter element in mouse and human V beta genes. The presence of decamer-binding activities was assayed by gel mobility-shift analysis using protein extracts from thymus, spleen, and nonlymphoid organs of adult mice. Two shifted complexes, designated T2 and T3, were seen only when the decamer was incubated with extracts from thymus. When extracts from mice of various gestational ages were tested for decamer-binding activity, one of the thymus-specific complexes, T2, was first detected at day 16; this coincides with the time of initial activation of the V beta locus. No decamer-binding activity was detected in extracts prepared from the thymuses of SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, which characteristically fail to rearrange these genes. Moreover, neither T2 nor T3 was detectable with extracts from spleen or from two T-cell lines that express the beta chain; this suggests that the presence of these two complexes is not absolutely required for transcription of the T-cell receptor beta locus. We conclude that there are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated factors that form complexes with the decamer sequence 5' of V beta; these may represent initiation factors that control the activation of germ-line T-cell receptor V beta genes for transcription and/or rearrangement.\r"

Using the polymerase chain reaction, we have identified two additional Dictyostelium G alpha genes, G alpha 4 and G alpha 5, that are developmentally regulated. Transcripts from both of these genes are primarily expressed during the multicellular stages of development, suggesting possible roles in cell differentiation or morphogenesis. The entire G alpha 4 gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein consisting of 345 amino acids. The G alpha 4 subunit is homologous to other previously identified G alpha subunits, including the Dictyostelium G alpha 1 (43% identity) and G alpha 2 (41% identity) subunits. However, the G alpha 4 subunit contains some unusual sequence divergences in residues highly conserved among most eukaryotic G alpha subunits, suggesting that G alpha 4 may be a member of another class of G alpha subunits.\r"

A tight cluster of transcription initiation sites has been localized 24-25 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site and 28-29 nucleotides downstream of a TATA-like sequence. The H+, K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene is split into seven exons encoding predicted structural domains of the beta subunit protein. The intracellular amino-terminal and putative transmembrane domains are encoded by individual exons, and the extracellular carboxyl-terminal domain is encoded by five exons. The exon/intron organization of the mouse H+,K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene is identical to that of the mouse Na+,K(+)-ATPase beta 2 subunit gene. The conservation of genomic organization, together with the high sequence homology, indicates that the mouse H+,K(+)-ATPase beta and Na+,K(+)-ATPase beta 2 subunit genes originated from a common ancestral gene.\r"

Surprisingly, this is associated with severe destruction of the follicular organization of lymphoid organs, indicating a crucial role for dendritic cells and marginal zone macrophages in maintaining follicular structure. Once established, this immunopathology cannot be readily reversed by the elimination of CD8+ effector cells. Such a T-cell-mediated pathogenesis may play a pivotal role in acquired virus-induced immunosuppression and may represent one strategy by which virus escapes immune surveillance and establishes persistent infections in initially immunocompetent hosts.\r"

  ".W": "To study the mechanisms that activate expression of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene during pressure-induced hypertrophy, we have developed and characterized an in vivo murine model of myocardial cell hypertrophy. We employed microsurgical techniques to produce a stable 35- to 45-mmHg pressure gradient across the thoracic aorta of the mouse that is associated with rapid and transient expression of an immediate-early gene program (c-fos/c-jun/junB/Egr-1/nur-77), an increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, and up-regulation of the endogenous ANF gene. These responses that are identical to those in cultured cell and other in vivo models of hypertrophy. To determine whether tissue-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, we used a transgenic mouse line in which 500 base pairs of the human ANF promoter region directs atrial-specific expression of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen), with no detectable expression in the ventricles. Thoracic aortic banding of these mice led to a 20-fold increase in the endogenous ANF mRNA in the ventricle but no detectable expression of the T-antigen marker gene. This result provides evidence that atrial-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, suggesting that a distinct set of regulatory cis sequences may mediate the up-regulation of the ANF gene during in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy. This murine model demonstrates the utility of microsurgical techniques to study in vivo cardiac physiology in transgenic mice and should allow the application of genetic approaches to identify the mechanisms that activate ventricular expression of the ANF gene during in vivo hypertrophy.\r"

The major, although not exclusive, focus of the program is on tertiary prevention undertaken with women defined as \"high risk\" for producing alcohol affected children. Of the 48 women referred to the program at the Tuba City, AZ, Indian Medical Center between January 1988 and July 1989, 39 (81 percent) became participants. Complete followup was possible on 31; 17 of them reported alcohol abstinence in July 1989, 18 months into the program. Of the 29 referred women who were pregnant at the time, 21 agreed to participate; of these, 19 (85.7 percent) were abstinent by the third trimester of pregnancy; 5 voluntarily accepted offers of contraceptive measures after the birth of their child.\r"

  ".W": "Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease of epidemic proportions, infecting an estimated 4 million people a year. It results not only in infertility and ectopic pregnancy but also in infant morbidity and mortality. Ectopic pregnancy is responsible for 11 percent of maternal deaths. About 60 percent of infected women can transmit the bacteria at birth to their infants. Early detection and treatment of chlamydia in both men and women, especially prenatal women, is critical. Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the cervix was found in 8.1 percent of a group of 1,004 pregnant women at a hospital prenatal clinic by means of a direct fluorescent antibody test. The prevalence of C. trachomatis was only 0.7 percent in 277 pregnant women receiving prenatal care from private practitioners. All patients between 27 and 30 weeks gestation who tested positive were treated with oral erythromycin. Their partners were treated with tetracycline. The outcome of pregnancy in patients treated for chlamydial infection was compared with a control group of noninfected mothers from the same population. The frequency of premature rupture of the membranes, prematurity, and low Apgar scores among the treated women were not significantly different from those in the control group. There was a significant difference, however, between the two groups in the incidence of low mean birth weight infants and the presence of meconium. Children can acquire a chlamydial infection at birth from contact with infected cervico-vaginal secretions. If not detected and treated, these infected infants may develop conjunctivitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. It is suggested, therefore, that all patients at prenatal clinics be screened for chlamydial cervicitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Low-income women's histories of pregnancies, their use or nonuse of contraception, and their marital status showed racial and ethnic differences in family formation patterns and fertility control practices. Data were analyzed from a survey of 918 low-income women in Los Angeles County. The sample contained about equal numbers of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics. The use of stratified samples equalized the poverty-level composition of the three racial and ethnic groups. First pregnancies for white and black women resulted primarily from nonuse of contraception while unmarried, but almost half of first pregnancies among Hispanics were intentional. Marital dissolution following pregnancy or childbearing was common among low-income whites and blacks, but Hispanics were more likely to have an intact marriage along with a higher average parity. Analyses of histories of pregnancies while controlling for demographic characteristics showed that racial and ethnic differences in rates of different types of pregnancies (classified as intended, accidental, or unprotected) and rates of abortion did not remain significant after adjustment for respondent characteristics and years of exposure to possible pregnancy. Actual parity, however, remained significant when these factors were controlled. Thus, results document distinctive patterns of family formation for low-income women in racial and ethnic subgroups of this population. Implications of these patterns of family formation for economic well-being are discussed.\r"

The authors developed comprehensive, practical recommendations for prevention of infectious complications in HIV-infected people. Recommendations are concerned with the pathogens that are more common or more severe in HIV-infected people. Several infectious complications can be prevented by avoiding ingestion of contaminated food or water. Zoonoses can be prevented by precautions to be taken in contacts with animals. The risk of several fungal diseases can be reduced if activities likely to lead to inhalation of spores are avoided. HIV-infected people should be advised how to lower adverse health effects of travel, especially international travel. The potential for infectious complications of sexual activity and illicit drug use should be stressed, and recommendations to reduce the risk are discussed. Recommendations for use of vaccines in HIV-infected people are reviewed. Blood CD4+ lymphocyte concentrations, tuberculin skin testing, Toxoplasma serology, and sexually transmitted disease screening should be performed in certain subsets of HIV-infected people. Guidelines for chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and tuberculosis are presented. Recent data suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected children.\r"

A sample of 68 articles from newspapers serving urban areas of various sizes in all regions of the United States was analyzed. Articles were coded into classifications according to how the news was played, headline bias (positive-negative-neutral), hospital mentions, quote sources, explanations for excessively high mortality rates, urban area population, and geographic region. The findings indicated that HCFA's release of the 1986 hospital mortality data received heavy news coverage. There were twice as many negative headlines as positive ones, although nearly 95 percent of the hospitals had mortality rates within expected ranges. Quotes from representatives of hospitals predominated in the newspaper articles, and they often blamed some aspect of the HCFA data for higher-than-expected mortality rates. Newspaper attention to the quality of hospital care clearly raised consumer awareness of the idea that health care quality can vary. The newspaper articles, however, provided no guidance on obtaining valid data or on using it to make health care choices.\r"

They were (a) to identify persons and groups with the capability to provide training, (b) to identify systems and networks for communication and collaboration on health issues related to day care at the local level, and (c) to determine the child day care providers' concerns, needs, and future interests regarding child health. Information was collected on relevant courses offered by universities, colleges, and adult education programs; on training offered by child health authorities; and on formal curriculums offered by local and national sources. Day care center and family day care home providers were surveyed to determine their knowledge of child health issues, their concerns, and their future needs. The providers surveyed cared for a total of 14,340 children. Information on local networks was obtained from the surveys, from interviews, and from a special task force that had been set up to advise the State legislature. Study results supported the conclusion that a coordinated system of State-wide training was feasible, given the existing networks of training and educational resources, the number of day care providers who had already been motivated to seek some training in child health practices, and the almost unanimous interest among day care providers in obtaining training. Mandating training in child health for day care providers will require a commitment in the form of new legislation outlining basic requirements and allocating funding. The implementation and costs of such a mandate at the State and local level are discussed.\r"

Since the development of effective hepatitis B vaccines, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) has recommended that health care workers receive the vaccine. In this study, 78 laboratory training programs and 83 nursing training programs were surveyed regarding availability and usage of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine was made available to students in 81 percent of the laboratory programs and 23 percent of the nursing programs. In those programs making the vaccine available, only 59 percent of the laboratory programs and 5 percent of the nursing programs reported a high (greater than 75 percent) use by students. Concern about cost and payment for the vaccine was the most common reason (80 percent) noted by laboratory schools that did not have hepatitis B vaccination programs for students. Of the nursing schools that did not have vaccine programs, 58 percent had not yet considered a program. At laboratory schools with vaccination programs, who paid for the vaccine (hospital or school versus student) was among the most important determinants for vaccine usage by students. These findings point out that some laboratory schools and many nursing schools have not applied the ACIP recommendations to their own programs. Educational efforts and creative payment plans for the vaccine are needed to increase the availability and use of hepatitis B vaccine among laboratory and nursing students.\r"

During screening, patients underwent a physical examination as well as completing a survey to assess exercise and health behavior habits. Three exercise groups were compared: (a) patients who expended more than 600 kilocalories per week during exercise, (b) patients who expended 600 kilocalories or less, and (c) patients who did not exercise. The mean body weights of both exercise groups were found to be less than the nonexercise group, and the heavy exercise group also had a lower mean body mass index. Heavy exercisers reported greater caloric intakes than both moderate and nonexercisers. There were no differences found concerning the composition of their diets among groups. The heavy exercise group reported wearing their seatbelts a greater percentage of the time and visited the dentist more often compared with the sedentary group. There were no significant differences found among exercise groups concerning blood sugar monitoring, alcohol consumption, smoking, or in obtaining periodic health examinations. It was concluded that exercise was associated with several, but not a majority, of other healthful behaviors in a population of diabetics.\r"

However, participation is not uniform among all groups of eligible persons. This study examines the geographic variation in WIC participation rates of eligible pregnant women in Rhode Island to determine whether the program is effective in reaching the neediest segments of the population. Eight groups of small geographic areas in Rhode Island (census tracts) were formed on the basis of need for maternal and child health services, as determined from a statistical method employing factor and cluster analysis of existing health and sociodemographic data. Among these eight groups, participation rates in WIC during 1983-84 ranged from 46 percent to more than 100 percent of estimated eligible pregnant women. The rates were positively correlated with measures of need, strongly (r = 0.92) with an index of maternal risk, and less strongly (r = 0.79) with an index of birth outcomes. The results of this study have enabled the Rhode Island WIC Program to direct its outreach efforts more specifically to geographic areas where the need for the program's assistance is greatest. The procedures described in this report comprise a technique that can be generally applied to measure program effectiveness in marketing and outreach where relevant data are available by small geographic areas. The data requirements are (a) population-based estimates of program need and (b) program utilization measures. If these data can be aggregated to a common set of small geographic areas, the use of marketing analysis techniques becomes possible, and program benefits in the area of outreach and recruitment can be realized.\r"

There were in all 17 boys and 31 girls. The distribution of 15 minerals in hair, serum, and urine samples was determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. Mineral concentrations from the normal children were compared with concentrations obtained from the children with iron overload, iron deficiency anemia, and thalassemia trait. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences among any of the groups. Mineral concentrations from the normal infants and children may be useful as reference values. The analysis of hair iron as a valid screening test for body iron status in children is not supported by our data.\r"

A total of 431 smokers were identified for evaluation at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after receiving the \"Guia.\" Self-reported quit rates declined from 21.1 percent at 2.5 months to 13.7 percent at 14 months; 8.4 percent of the sample had a validated quit status by saliva cotinine test at 1 year. Persons older than 44 years were more likely to remain nonsmokers, but sex, education, acculturation score, and cigarettes smoked per day did not predict smoking cessation.

However, little attention has been given to another common and unavoidable source of tobacco advertising, that which is encountered in retail stores. In July 1987, we conducted a survey of 61 packaged goods retail stores in Buffalo, NY, to assess the prevalence and type of point-of-sale tobacco advertising. In addition, store owners or managers were surveyed to determine their store's policy regarding tobacco advertising, receipt of monetary incentives from distributors for displaying tobacco ads, and willingness to display antitobacco ads. Six types of stores were involved in the study: 10 supermarkets, 10 privately owned grocery stores, 9 chain convenience food stores that do not sell gasoline, 11 chain convenience food stores that sell gasoline, 11 chain pharmacies, and 10 private pharmacies. Two-thirds of the stores displayed tobacco posters, and 87 percent had promotional items advertising tobacco products, primarily cigarettes. Larger stores, and those that were privately owned, tended to display more posters and promotional items. Eighty percent of tobacco product displays were for cigarettes, 16 percent for smokeless tobacco products, and 4 percent for cigars and pipe tobacco. Convenience stores selling gasoline had the most separate tobacco product displays. Of tobacco product displays, 24 percent were located adjacent to candy and snack displays. Twenty-nine of the 61 store owners or managers indicated that their store had a policy regulating the display of tobacco ads and tobacco product displays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From 1968 to 1977, Texas had a comprehensive motorcycle helmet use law, which was estimated to have saved 650 lives. But the law was amended in 1977 to apply only to motorcycle operators and passengers under age 18. In September 1989, a new law was passed that required helmets for all motorcycle operators and passengers. Observations of helmet use were conducted before and after the law took effect in 18 Texas cities using a survey design providing a cross-section of urban and suburban traffic across the State. The surveys indicated that helmet use increased from less than 50 percent just before the law to 90 percent immediately after, and it increased further to more than 95 percent 2 months later. These results confirm the unique effectiveness of comprehensive helmet use laws in applying the proven public health benefits of helmets to the reduction of motorcycle injuries and deaths.\r"

Epidemiologists were classified according to education and program area. A total of 117 epidemiologists were identified, yielding a range among the States of 0.6 to 8.3 (median 1.9) epidemiologists per million population. The most common degree was a medical degree, followed by master's training in epidemiology or biostatistics; only 9 percent had doctoral training in epidemiology or biostatistics. More than one-third of the epidemiologists worked in infectious diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases, and about one-fifth worked in environmental epidemiology. The areas of injuries, cancer, chronic diseases, maternal and child health, and occupational health collectively accounted for about one-fifth of epidemiologists. The results of the survey suggest room for further epidemiologic training among health department epidemiologists. The results also identify areas where additional epidemiologic input would be beneficial.\r"

Those who shared needles were more likely to have sex with IV drug users and had more sexual partners. Respondents who used crack used condoms less frequently. Those with multiple partners were more likely to engage in anal intercourse. Three-quarters perceived themselves at risk of AIDS.\r"

Treatment of murine thymocytes and a variety of murine T cell lines with the calcium ionophore ionomycin decreased CD45 PTPase activity. Ionomycin treatment also led to a decreased phosphorylation of serine residues in CD45. These results indicate that increased intracellular calcium modulates CD45 PTPase activity, demonstrating regulation of CD45 PTPase activity in vivo, and also implicate serine dephosphorylation as a possible mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The proposal that all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) types in contemporary humans stem from a common ancestor present in an African population some 200,000 years ago has attracted much attention. To study this proposal further, two hypervariable segments of mtDNA were sequenced from 189 people of diverse geographic origin, including 121 native Africans. Geographic specificity was observed in that identical mtDNA types are shared within but not between populations. A tree relating these mtDNA sequences to one another and to a chimpanzee sequence has many deep branches leading exclusively to African mtDNAs. An African origin for human mtDNA is supported by two statistical tests. With the use of the chimpanzee and human sequences to calibrate the rate of mtDNA evolution, the age of the common human mtDNA ancestor is placed between 166,000 and 249,000 years. These results thus support and extend the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.\r"

The in vitro sensitivity to ddI decreased during the 12 months following ddI initiation, whereas AZT sensitivity increased. Analysis of the reverse transcriptase coding region revealed a mutation associated with reduced sensitivity to ddI. When this mutation was present in the same genome as a mutation known to confer AZT resistance, the isolates showed increased sensitivity to AZT. Analysis of HIV-1 variants confirmed that the ddI resistance mutation alone conferred ddI and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine resistance, and suppressed the effect of the AZT resistance mutation. The use of combination therapy for HIV-1 disease may prevent drug-resistant isolates from emerging.\r"

The mean percentage of calories from total fat and saturated, unsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids was similar throughout the year even though the patients knew they were taking an effective lipid-lowering agent. However, the diets of greater than 40% of women included less than two-thirds of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folic acid, vitamins B-6 and D, and calcium and zinc; in men, folic acid and zinc intakes were low. We conclude that patients comply with lipid-lowering diets even when they know that they are receiving an effective serum lipid-lowering agent. However, for both men and women special attention should be given to the intake of several nutrients.\r"

Abnormal patterns of mitochondrial translation products were observed in the skeletal muscle of patients, consistent with the expected consequential defect in protein synthesis. The genealogical studies of the three patients, as well as mtDNA from one published MERRF patient and from nine other normal and disease controls, revealed that the tRNA(Lys) mutations in the MERRF patients have arisen independently. These observations provided evidence that the base substitution is a causal mutation for MERRF.\r"

Patients, aged 65 +/- 3 yr (mean +/- SE), received O2 and N2O (1:1) and either 0.75% isoflurane (n = 7) or 0.5% halothane (n = 7). Patient demographic and clinical data were similar for both groups and followed the expected strata of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Measurements were made during the period of temporary bypass shunting. In the isoflurane group, increasing PaCO2 from 33.3 +/- 1.4 to 43.4 +/- 1.3 mm Hg resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in CBF from 21 +/- 1 to 35 +/- 4 mL.100 g-1.min-1. In the halothane group, increasing PaCO2 from 31.1 +/- 1 to 39.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg resulted in a significant increase in CBF from 26 +/- 3 to 37 +/- 3 mL.100 g-1.min-1. Mean CBF reactivity to changes in PaCO2 (mL.100 g-1.min-1.mm Hg-1) was 1.74 +/- 0.39 for isoflurane and 1.78 +/- 0.4 for halothane (not significant), corresponding to a relative change of 4.8% +/- 0.8% and 5.2% +/- 1.3% per mm Hg, respectively. There is no significant difference between halothane and isoflurane in their effects on CO2 reactivity in the mildly hypocapnic to normocapnic range.\r"

Complications and results of pregnancy in these individuals were compared with those of 1,906 births at Charity Hospital, New Orleans during the time of the study. A subgroup of five patients underwent immunologic testing prenatally and postpartum. Thirty-one percent of HIV seropositive subjects had premature labor and low birth weight infants. Only 3.1% of the controls had premature labor and low birth weight infants (p less than or equal to .05). The percentage of C-sections was lower in the study group (12.5% versus 31.3%, p less than .10). All patients remained free of HIV-related disease through the postpartum period. Mean CD4 percentages were lower postpartum (21.9 +/- 3.4) than prepartum (45.1 +/- 6.7) in all five patients studied, although proliferative responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed were unchanged during the study period. One of the five seropositive patients who underwent immunologic testing with a CD4:CD8 ratio of less than 1.0 prepartum, had a progressive fall in CD4 percentages from 30% to 11% during the course of the study. HIV-I core antigen was not detected in the serum of any of the five patients during pregnancy or postpartum. Thus, HIV-I infection influenced both the course and outcome of pregnancy in the population studied. Further studies are indicated to assess the effects of pregnancy on the progression of HIV-related immunodeficiency in this population.\r"

The neurites were found both free in the neuropil as well as surrounding senile plaques. Quantitative analysis showed that dystrophic neurites were significantly increased in patients with AD compared with control subjects and the number of dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles correlated with the clinical severity of dementia. Widespread cerebral beta/A4 protein deposition may be necessary but by itself is insufficient for the development of dementia in AD.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow (radioactive microspheres), intracranial pressure (subdural bolt), and retinal histopathology were examined in 20 dogs undergoing 150 minutes of hypothermic (28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass to compare alpha-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 40 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) and pH-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 61 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) techniques of arterial carbon dioxide tension management. Pump flow (80 mL.kg-1.min-1), mean aortic pressure (78 +/- 2 mm Hg), and hemoglobin level (87 +/- 3 g/L [8.7 +/- 0.3 g/dL]) were maintained constant. During bypass, intracranial pressure progressively increased in the alpha-stat group from 6.0 +/- 1.0 to 13.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and in the pH-stat group from 7.7 +/- 1.1 to 14.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), although there was no evidence of loss of intracranial compliance or intracranial edema formation as assessed by brain water content. With cooling, cerebral blood flow decreased by 56% to 62% in the alpha-stat group (p less than 0.05) and by 48% to 56% in the pH-stat group (p less than 0.05). However, 30 minutes after rewarming to 37 degrees C, cerebral blood flow in both groups failed to increase and remained significantly depressed compared with baseline values. Both groups showed similar amounts of ischemic retinal damage, with degeneration of bipolar cells found in the inner nuclear layer in 67% of animals. We conclude that, independent of the arterial carbon dioxide tension management technique, (1) cerebral perfusion decreased comparably during prolonged hypothermic bypass, (2) intracranial pressure increases progressively, (3) ischemic damage to retinal cells occurs despite maintenance of aortic pressure and flow, and (4) a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion persists after rewarming.\r"

The receptor homologue is activated by a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes. Identification of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor should help elucidate the mechanism of the hypolipidaemic effect of these hepatocarcinogens and aid evaluation of their potential carcinogenic risk to man.\r"
