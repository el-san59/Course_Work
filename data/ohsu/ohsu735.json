  ".W": "Generally, three devices (the Genucom Knee Analysis System, the MEDmetric KT-1000 Arthrometer, and the Stryker Knee Laxity Tester), which have been presented in the literature, may be used to assess clinically the amount of knee laxity in an objective manner. This study compared the reproducibility of the anterior and posterior knee laxity values for each and made direct comparisons of the results obtained. Thirty asymptomatic subjects were given a test-retest protocol on both legs with all three devices. Devices were tested in a counterbalanced order. Repeatability of test values within devices was variable, but all were acceptable, the lowest being r = 0.74. Analysis of variance (AN-OVA), and correlational analysis revealed that device-specific anterior and posterior laxity values were produced. We concluded that each commercially available knee laxity testing device can provide reproducible quantitative measurements of knee laxity; however, due to differences in device sensitivities and functional design, numerical results from one device cannot be generalized to another device.\r"

Pressure was recorded simultaneously in the posterior tibial muscle and in the flexor digitorum muscle during an exercise test and at rest after exercise. This study shows that intramuscular pressures during exercise and the time period for normalization of the pressure at rest after exercise were within normal limits. The result of pressure recording depends on which muscle in the deep posterior compartment is investigated and on the type of work performed. This article describes some of the difficulties associated with pressure recording in the deep posterior compartment. Chronic compartment syndrome in the deep posterior compartment as a reason for pain in the posteromedial part of the lower leg could not be demonstrated.\r"

Our primary objective was to evaluate whether the type of pole used had an effect on the injury rate. We found that the strap handled pole without any platform had the lowest injury rate. The saber type pole handle had the highest injury rate. Other observations showed ulnar collateral ligament injury of the thumb to be the most common upper extremity injury to skiers. A proportionally high number of skiers with upper extremity injuries were advanced skiers.\r"

The duration of preoperative symptoms averaged 18 months. In all cases, conservative treatment was first attempted but failed to alleviate symptoms. Only those patients whose lesions and symptoms were confined to the Achilles tendon segment 2 to 6 cm proximal of the insertion were included in this study. All athletes who had an insertion tendinopathy or a lesion at the musculotendinous junction were excluded from this study. The surgical procedure depended on the lesion. For 93 tendons exhibiting pure peritendinitis, treatment consisted of a simple release of the fascia cruris and the peritenon. For the 50 tendons with tendinosis, a resection of diseased tendon tissue was performed. The defect could be sutured side to side in 26 cases but in the other 24 cases, reinforcement with a turned down tendon flap was necessary because of the extensive debridement. Of the 93 cases in which only dorsal release was performed, results were considered excellent in 54 cases, good in 28, fair in 8, and poor in 3 cases. Of the 26 cases in which side-to-side suture was performed, 15 cases were rated as having excellent results, 4 as good, 4 as fair, and 3 as poor. For the 24 cases in which a turned down tendon flap procedure was performed, the result was excellent in 12 cases, good in 9, fair in 2, and poor in 1 case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One year follow-up statistics were reviewed for the presence of 13 different complications. The most prevalent complications were quadriceps weakness, flexion contracture, and patellofemoral pain. Quadriceps weakness (strength less than 80% of the normal side) was present in 65% of patients and correlated positively with flexion contracture, patellar irritabibilty, and ACL reconstructions using patellar tendon grafts. Flexion contracture of 5 degrees or more was present in 24% of patients and correlated positively with increased age and patellar irritability. Patellofemoral pain was present in 19% of patients and correlated positively with flexion contracture. Clinical relevance: The three most common complications of knee ligament surgery are shown to be strongly interrelated. It is likely that a causal relationship is present in which flexion contracture causes patellofemoral irritability, and that both of these factors, alone or in combination, result in quadriceps weakness. If this theory is correct, then it is crucial that postoperative rehabilitation programs place a major emphasis on the avoidance of flexion contracture.\r"

Several variables were recorded by means of a structured questionnaire, and by clinical and radiographic examination. The amount of physical activity from the age of 7 years onward was significantly greater in Group V than in Group C. The incidence of anterior knee pain during the year preceding the examination was higher in Group V (31%) than in Group C (6%; P less than 0.01). The most common reason for anterior knee pain in Group V was so-called \"jumper's knee.\" No significant difference between the groups was found in the incidence of clinical symptoms and signs of patellar chondromalacia. There were radiologically detectable soft tissue calcifications at the upper or lower pole of the patella or anterior to the patella in 38% of the subjects in Group V, but no such calcifications were seen in Group C (P less than 0.001). However, persistent symptoms did not correlate with the calcifications. Group V subjects had a slight but significant trend to patella alta when compared to Group C (P less than 0.05) according to the Blackburne and Peel index.\r"

Eighty patients, 12 women and 68 men, were matched in four groups according to sex, age, knee injuries, and follow-up time. Group I had two intact menisci; Group II, one meniscus successfully repaired; Group III, one meniscus removed; and Group IV, both menisci removed. The ACL was repaired acutely or reconstructed later in most cases and other significant ligament injuries were treated. All patients were reexamined clinically 6 to 8 years after injury. Knee function was recorded using the Lysholm knee function score. Activity level before injury and at followup was rated with the Tegner scale. Stability was tested and weightbearing roentgenograms were taken. There was a higher frequency of ACL reconstructions in Groups I and II, but instability was the same in all groups. No difference was found in Lysholm score (range, 86 to 92). The activity level was higher in Group IV at followup. A lower frequency of motion impairment was found in Group III, (20% versus 50%). Subjective evaluation was similar and positive in all groups. Group I had six meniscus ruptures during the follow-up period. In Group II three of the repaired menisci were removed, as were two of the contralateral menisci in Group III. Roentgenograms, available in 55 of 80 cases, showed osteoarthritis in 65%. There were no differences in the frequency of osteoarthritis among the first three groups, but Group IV had a higher incidence of osteoarthritic changes. Osteoarthritis did not result in lower knee function, poorer subjective evaluation, or increased impairment of motion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred ten injuries that resulted in a physician visit were reported. Ligament sprains, fractures, and contusions were the most frequent types of injury. Fifty percent of all injuries occurred in the lower extremities, with ankle injuries being the most common. Snowboard riders using equipment with increased ankle support seem to be more protected from lower extremity injuries. The lower extremity injuries were concentrated in the forward limb of the snowboarder, where the rider's weight is disproportionately distributed. Differences in the mechanism and spectrum of injury between snowboarding and skiing injuries were noted, including: impact rather than torsion as the major mechanism of injury, a significant lack of thumb injuries, comparative increase in ankle injuries, a decrease in knee injuries, and a higher percentage of upper extremity injuries.\r"

Thus, one can ask what differences might exist between men and women golfers. This study compares the electromyographic firing patterns of normal shoulder musculature in men and women professional golfers. Eight shoulder muscles (pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, anterior, middle and posterior deltoids) were studied using indwelling electromyography. A visual analysis revealed that women tended to have slightly more activity during the takeaway and forward swing phases, and the men tended to have more activity during acceleration and follow-through. However, an independent two-tailed t-test (P = 0.05) showed these differences not to be statistically significant. This finding is in keeping with injury incidence data from the LPGA Tour, PGA Tour, and Senior PGA Tour, which showed that all three tours have a similar incidence of shoulder injuries. This study does not compare the relative strength of men and women, however.\r"

The injured knees displayed increased anterior and distal displacements of the tibial intercondylar eminence. Abnormal tibial displacements in our patients indicate that the absence of the ACL is not completely compensated for during active extension past 30 degrees; close to the extended position, the tibial movements tend to normalize.\r"

The ACL is relatively hypovascular, with one-half the blood flow of the synovium of the suprapatellar pouch. Application of an anterior stress diminishes the blood flow to the ACL to one-fifth of the baseline value, an effect which is reversible. Division of the infrapatellar fat pad causes a two-fold decrease in perfusion to the ACL, whereas dissection of the enveloping synovium results in a complete cessation of blood flow.\r"

The results were compared to results obtained from a comparable group of asymptomatic athletes. Statistical analysis of the results of the evaluation indicated a significant displacement of the arc of motion of the second toe in the symptomatic athletes toward extension of the metatarsophalangeal joint and a decrease in flexion. Weakness or dysfunction of the intrinsic muscles in the symptomatic athletes was also found to be significant. This analysis supports the hypothesis that posteromedial middle one-third tibial stress symptoms may be related to overuse of the flexor digitorum longus muscle associated with mild claw toe deformity.\r"

We investigated an outbreak of furuncles that occurred among male athletes of a Kentucky high school during the 1986 to 1987 school year. The overall attack rate was 25% (31/124). The risk of developing a furuncle increased two to three times in those who had skin injury. Athletes who sustained abrasions more than twice per week (P less than 0.01), who had a cut that required bandaging (P = 0.01), or had an unspecified injury causing a missed practice or game (P = 0.04) were at increased risk. The risk of developing furunculosis did not appear to be related to contact with formites, but rather, to contact with furuncles. Although athletes shared common areas (showers, locker rooms, practice areas, the attack rates for varsity football (36%) and varsity basketball (33%) were four times greater than for nonvarsity teams (P less than 0.01). Players who had a friend with a furuncle were more than twice as likely to also have had a furuncle (P less than 0.01). Exposure to furuncles appeared to increase the risk of furunculosis independently of reported skin injury. Control and prevention should, therefore, focus on both reducing skin injury and reducing exposure to furuncles, rather than attempting to sterilize inanimate objects.\r"

All patients (n = 64) in this category who underwent a gut angiogram between 1980 and 1986 were studied. Pre-angiogram endoscopy was attempted in all patients and was nondiagnostic in 14 (22%). Contrast extravasation at angiography was seen in 25 of 64 patients (39%), and in over half of these patients endoscopy was nondiagnostic (n = 11) or wrong (n = 3). Attempts to control bleeding in this group by selective arterial embolization (n = 14) or intra-arterial vasopressin (n = 11) successfully averted operation in 13 of 25 patients (52%) and was associated with a 50% reduction in mortality (83% versus 38%). Selective embolization of vessels thought to be bleeding on clinical grounds without evidence of contrast extravasation (i.e., \"blind\" embolization) was not helpful in controlling hemorrhage. Urgent gut angiography in patients with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding of arteriocapillary source is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver and warrants continued application in this group of poor-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "The gastric bypass of the excluded esophagus in the palliative treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus carries a considerable mortality. One of the most significant events that contributes to this mortality is the disruption of the distal closure of the excluded esophagus. In order to avoid this, a distal-end esophagostomy accompanying the gastric bypass procedure was created in six patients with advanced carcinoma of the upper and middle third of the esophagus. This distal esophagostomy is carried out by extrapleural dissection and is developed to the back, at the level of the eighth rib, just lateral and adjacent to the spinal muscles. Operative survival of all these sick patients proves this to be a safe operation that avoids the fatal complication described.\r"

  ".W": "Primary resection with colostomy has been widely adopted during the past decade for the treatment of patients with severe complications of diverticulitis. Because of this, a retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing surgery for colonic diverticular disease during the two time periods 1974 to 1978 (n = 196) and 1982 to 1986 (n = 230). Forty-three patients had abscess or peritonitis from 1974 to 1978, whereas 52 had these complications from 1982 to 1986. Colostomy and drainage alone were used for 31 of 43 patients (72%) from 1974 to 1978, while primary resection with colostomy was used for 39 of 52 patients (75%) from 1982 to 1986 (p less than or equal to 0.5). Despite this shift in treatment method, mortality increased from 14% in 1974 to 1978 to 19% in 1982 to 1986 (p = NS). Patients with peritonitis had identical mortalities (22%) during both intervals. Patients with abscess experienced an increase in mortality from 8% in 1974 to 1978 to 15% in 1982 to 1986 (p = NS). The widespread use of primary resection for patients with severe complications of diverticulitis appears not to have altered mortality for those with diffuse peritonitis and may have worsened the outcome for those with abscess.\r"

  ".W": "Increased plasma levels of the catabolic hormones glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol have been implicated in mediating various metabolic alterations in trauma and sepsis. Their role in altered protein turnover and amino acid transport in skeletal muscle during sepsis, however, is not known. In the current study, rats were infused with a mixture of the catabolic hormones for 16 hours. Control animals were infused with vehicle solution. Protein synthesis and degradation rates were measured in incubated, intact soleus muscles as incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into protein and release of tyrosine into incubation medium, respectively. Muscle amino acid uptake was determined by measuring the intracellular to extracellular ratio of [3H]-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid after incubation for 2 hours. Infusion of catabolic hormones for 16 hours resulted in elevated plasma glucose and lactate levels, reduced plasma concentrations of most amino acids, and accelerated muscle protein breakdown, similar to previous findings in septic rats. Protein synthesis rates and amino acid uptake in incubated muscles were not significantly different in control and hormone-infused rats. The current study suggests that increased muscle proteolysis in sepsis and severe injury may be mediated in part by catabolic hormones. In contrast, reduced muscle protein synthesis and amino acid uptake are probably signaled by other substances or mechanisms.\r"

These patients were reviewed from the standpoint of cosmetic results and function as well as their operative and postoperative courses. In both groups, the results were generally good. However, revisionary surgery was more frequent in those receiving the iliac crest. This group also had a higher incidence of intraoral wound breakdown and bone exposure. Nevertheless, the sheer size of the iliac crest made it ideal for massive oromandibular defects, just as its natural curvature lent itself to precise replication of the mandible in bone-only reconstructions. Its bulk proved a major obstacle in small composite defects. The radial forearm flap carried thin, pliable, well-vascularized skin that was superior to groin skin for oral lining. Bone gaps of up to 9 cm could be handled with ease, thus making it complementary to the iliac crest over the wide spectrum of mandibular reconstruction.\r"

Our results confirm the prognostic value of the APACHE II scoring system, measured either retrospectively or prospectively, in patients who undergo emergency operations for perforated ulcers. When measured preoperatively, it accurately stratifies these patients to various risk groups and should therefore be used in future trials examining various treatment aspects of this condition. Our data, evaluating the results of various procedures in subgroups of patients stratified by the APACHE II, failed to support the superiority of one approach over another.\r"

The electrode, which incorporated a thermistor, had a linear response to oxygen tension (r = 0.995, p less than 0.001). The patients were all maintained on an inspired oxygen concentration of 33 +/- 3% and had a mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 124.9 +/- 31.9 mm Hg. Tissue oxygen tension measurements (mm Hg, mean +/- SD) were recorded from the serosal surfaces of the stomach (46.3 +/- 15.4), mid-ileum (36 +/- 9.7), terminal ileum (33.5 +/- 11.5), cecum (30.3 +/- 7.4), transverse colon (38.5 +/- 10), descending colon (29.3 +/- 11), and sigmoid colon (39.2 +/- 7.7) and tended to increase with increasing PaO2 (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). Arterial occlusion resulted in a gradual decrease in tissue oxygen tension. It is concluded that intraoperative tissue oxygen tension measurement is feasible, and that the technique may have clinical applications in the assessment of intestinal viability.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the widespread practice of preoperative transfusion to attain a 10 g/dL level of hemoglobin, the relationship between preoperative hemoglobin level, operative blood loss, and mortality was studied by analyzing the results of 113 operations in 107 consecutive Jehovah's Witness patients who underwent major elective surgery. Ninety-three patients had preoperative hemoglobin values greater than 10 g/dL; 20 had preoperative hemoglobin levels between 6 to 10 g/dL. Mortality for preoperative hemoglobin levels greater than 10 g/dL was 3 of 93 (3.2%); for preoperative hemoglobin levels between 6 to 10 g/dL, mortality was 1 of 20 (5%). Mortality was significantly increased with an estimated blood loss of greater than 500 mL, regardless of the preoperative hemoglobin level (p less than 0.025). More importantly, there was no mortality if estimated blood loss was less than 500 mL, regardless of the preoperative hemoglobin level. From these data, we conclude that: (1) Mortality in elective surgery appears to depend more on estimated blood loss than on preoperative hemoglobin levels; and (2) Elective surgery can be done safely in patients with a preoperative hemoglobin level as low as 6 g/dL if estimated blood loss is kept below 500 mL.\r"

Thirty-two animals received continuous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into either the portal vein or hepatic artery for a period of 7 days. Drug infusions were begun at 0, 2, 4, and 6 days after the time of tumor inoculation in four groups of animals, respectively. Subsequent tumor growth in these animals at 1 month was compared with tumor growth in 11 control animals that did not receive chemotherapy. When 5-FU was administered via the portal vein on the same day as tumor inoculation, liver metastases were reduced by approximately 91% (p = 0.004). Portal vein chemotherapy administered 6 days after tumor inoculation, when macroscopic nodules had a mean diameter of 0.33 +/- 0.03 mm (SE), produced no tumor response (p = 0.36). Histologic examination of these lesions revealed early invasion outside distended portal venules. In contrast, hepatic artery 5-FU infusions administered at 0, 2, 4, and 6 days after tumor implantation all reduced the subsequent development of hepatic metastases by approximately two thirds of that observed in the untreated group (p = 0.004). We conclude that hepatic artery chemotherapy may have an important complementary role to play as an adjuvant treatment for gastrointestinal cancer.\r"

To identify areas of inexperience among incoming interns, we asked 40 first-year residents to indicate which bedside and emergency room procedures and operations (or parts of operations) they had performed in medical school and to rate how confident they were in performing those procedures as a result of their experiences. Respondents indicated that placement of nasogastric tubes, Foley catheters, and central lines were procedures they commonly performed (78.4% to 97.3%); they less frequently placed arterial and pulmonary arterial lines and chest tubes (21.6% to 64.9%). Many students had opportunities to assist in closure of incisions in actual operations (60%), but only 22% performed other parts of operative procedures. Opportunities to perform procedures did not correlate with the length of time spent on surgical rotations. Nearly half (49%) participated in animal surgery laboratories as part of their surgical rotation. These findings suggest that many interns have not performed some basic procedures by the time they enter their residency. Instruction in technical skills in clinical medicine, frequently surgical, represents a deficiency in medical school curricula. The general inexperience of surgical interns in performing these procedures must be remembered when assigning these duties.\r"

Old age, emergency operation, angina, previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic signs of ischemia, type of surgical procedure, and hypokalemia were identified as individual factors useful in predicting outcome. Thirty-two patients (4.65%) developed PMI. Seven of these 32 patients (21.9%) and eight more patients without PMI--a total of 15 patients (2.2%)--died a cardiac death.

  ".W": "We studied 60 children undergoing elective surgery to evaluate the effect of interactions between vecuronium and isoflurane or halothane on the potency and duration of neuromuscular blockade, as measured by electromyography. Vecuronium was first administered by a logarithm-based cumulative method (14, 22, 35, 56, 89 micrograms/kg) in 10 children anesthetized with thiopental (5 mg/kg), alfentanil (15 micrograms/kg first dose, then 10 micrograms/kg), and N2O/O2 (60:40) until a 95% +/- 2% twitch depression (ED95) was obtained. Thirty children given the same balanced anesthesia were then randomly assigned to three groups (n = 10 in each) to receive a single ED20 (21 micrograms/kg), ED50 (33 micrograms/kg), or ED80 (47 micrograms/kg) intravenous bolus of vecuronium calculated from the mean regression line of twitch responses of the first 10 children. In the second part of the study, 20 children were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.2%) or halothane (0.7%) and compared with the previous 10 children anesthetized with alfentanil-N2O. Potency of vecuronium determined by single-bolus or logarithm-based cumulative techniques was not significantly different. Isoflurane and halothane significantly decreased ED50 (22.3 +/- 1.6 and 25.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms/kg, respectively; mean +/- SE) and ED95 (41.5 +/- 3.3 and 46.7 +/- 3.2 micrograms/kg, respectively) compared with alfentanil-N2O (ED50: 32.8 +/- 0.8 micrograms/kg, ED95: 70.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms/kg). Recovery rate from vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade was significantly longer with isoflurane than with alfentanil-N2O or halothane. We conclude that in children single-bolus and logarithm-based cumulative techniques give similar potency estimates for vecuronium. Isoflurane and halothane increase by similar amounts the neuromuscular potency of vecuronium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group A (PCEA) patients self-administered, using a patient-controlled analgesia device, 4-mL increments of 0.125% bupivacaine with 1: 400,000 epinephrine, to a maximum 12 mL/h as required.

Hourly assessments of pain relief (visual analogue scale), satisfaction, sensory and motor block, blood pressure, and cervical dilatation were made. In addition, retrospective pain assessments were made in patients requesting analgesia in the preceding hour, indicating their maximum pain during that time. The groups were demographically comparable and equally low hourly bupivacaine requirements were seen (group A, 6.36 +/- 0.43 mg; group B, 6.23 +/- 0.39 mg) producing similar mean sensory levels. Pain relief obtained in both groups was similar but was associated with greater satisfaction in patients using PCEA (P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine were studied in chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. On the day of study, the urinary bladder was catheterized. Ropivacaine (2.5 or 3.0 mg/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion over 2 or 4 min. Serial samples of arterial blood and urine were collected over 5 h, and drug concentrations were determined using a gas chromatographic technique. Total clearance of ropivacaine was lower in the pregnant animals (21.6 +/- 4.5 mL.min-1.kg-1) compared with the nonpregnant animals (45.1 +/- 6.7 mL.min-1.kg-1). There was a tendency toward a decrease in the volume of distribution during the terminal exponential phase of drug elimination of 2.03 +/- 0.36 L/kg in the pregnant and 4.32 +/- 1.03 L/kg in the nonpregnant sheep. Thus the difference in the elimination half-life was only minimal: 74.7 +/- 10.7 min in the pregnant and 64.4 +/- 7.4 min in the nonpregnant animals. It is concluded that ovine pregnancy is accompanied by changes in the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine. Inadvertent intravenous injections of similar drug doses to pregnant and nonpregnant women might result in higher plasma concentrations of ropivacaine in the former. However, the rate of decline in plasma levels of the drug would be similar in both.\r"

At 5-6 wk of age, the arterial pressure of SH and WKY rats did not differ, and the effects of thiobarbiturates on aortic strips from SH and WKY rats were similar. By contrast, at the age of 10-12 or 20-21 wk arterial pressure was higher in SH than in WKY rats, and responses to thiobarbiturates differed in aortic strips from SH and WKY rats: contractile responses were greater in WKY than in SH rats, and relaxing effects were greater in SH than in WKY rats. Responses to sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the aortas of SH and WKY rats, but the effects of nifedipine were greater in strips from SH rats than from WKY rats at the age of 10-12 wk. Ca2(+)-induced contractions of strips exposed to Ca2(+)-free media and depolarized by high K+ were inhibited by treatment with thiamylal; the inhibition was greater in SH than in WKY rats. The increase in smooth-muscle relaxation induced by thiobarbiturates in strips from SH rats may be due to increased sensitivity to the Ca2(+)-channel blocking action of thiobarbiturates.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies of the effects of inhalation anesthetics on somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have examined SSEP at single times after initiation of an anesthetic. This study describes SSEP changes as functions of time of exposure to isoflurane. Both transient and sustained SSEP changes were observed. Nonlinear regression was used to fit exponential terms to the trend curves for end-tidal anesthetic concentration and SSEP peak latency. End-tidal concentrations could be well described by two exponential terms, one with a long and one with a short time constant. Isoflurane at 1% inspired concentration produced a sustained SSEP latency change that could be fit by a single exponential term; the time constant was essentially identical to the long time constant of end-tidal concentration. The long time constants ranged from 7 to 33 min. At 0.5% isoflurane, SSEP changes were often small or not sustained, and the changes could not always be well described by an exponential curve. These data suggest that the time-course of anesthetic effects on SSEPs may be prolonged and complex, and the possibility of changes over time should be considered both in experimental studies and during intra-operative monitoring.\r"

Nociceptive sensitivity was assessed with hot-plate and tail-flick techniques. None of the three drugs alone was associated with appreciable analgesic effects in the doses used. The simultaneous administration of the three drugs resulted in marked analgesia superior to that of all binary combinations of these drugs. Two-way analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences in hot-plate and tail-flick latencies after drug treatments (P less than 0.001). The significant differences in the area under the time-response curve values (P less than 0.001) might indicate not only an increased analgesic effect, but also a prolongation of antinociception. These results suggest the existence of hitherto unreported interactions between drugs involved in the production of analgesia.\r"

Because of the sparsity of documentation for human physiologic responses to hyperbaric N2O, we studied eight male volunteers at 2 ATA (1520 mm Hg) anesthetized with N2O only for periods of 2-4 h. N2O partial pressures ranged from 836 to 1368 mm Hg. The anesthetic state was associated with tachypnea, tachycardia, increases in systemic blood pressure, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and at times, clonus and opisthotonus. A stable level of physiologic activity was difficult to maintain.\r"

As evaluation of hepatic chemiluminescence has been shown to provide a noninvasive assay for oxidative radical reactions, we have made continuous in vivo measurements of hepatic light output in the phenobarbital-induced halothane anesthetized rat and compared them with observations made during chloroform anesthesia. Chloroform produced a far more rapid and more profound increase in chemiluminescence, a phenomenon probably related to depletion of hepatic glutathione. These findings are consistent with significant differences in hepatic pathology associated with the two agents.\r"

This report details our anesthetic management, which was used in 23 patients who underwent 27 procedures, and presents three illustrative cases. A continuous infusion of alfentanil and a 0.625-2.5-mg dose of droperidol were administered to the patients who were easily arousable during the procedure, and were able to cooperate with positioning change requests. Our patients did not develop apnea, hemodynamically significant bradycardia, or chest wall rigidity. One patient became nauseated, and one patient experienced a hypotensive episode that was unheralded by a change in respiratory rate, heart rate, or oxygen saturation. The patients were comfortable throughout the procedure, alert upon arrival to the postanesthesia care unit, and satisfied with this technique. A continuous infusion of alfentanil can be successfully used for the management of patients undergoing biliary lithotripsy.\r"

Group A (20 patients) was treated with TTFCA 60 mg tid; Group B (20 patients) was treated with 30 mg tid; Group C (12 patients) was treated with placebo; and Group D (10 normal subjects) was treated with TTFCA 60 mg tid in an open study. Capillary filtration rate was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography, ankle edema by a new system called AECT (Ankle edema coin tester). Subjective symptoms of venous hypertension were assessed by an analogue scale line considering four symptoms: swelling sensation, restless lower extremity, pain and cramps, and tiredness. CFR, AC, and AE were significantly higher in patients in comparison with normal subjects. After four weeks of TTFCA treatment there was a significant decrease of the abnormally increased CFR, AC, and AECT time in patients. This was also greater in the higher dose group. No significant change was observed in the placebo group and in normal subjects treated with TTFCA. Symptoms were also significantly improved in the two groups treated with the active drug according to the dose.

Initial systolic hypertension was shown in 26.6% of patients. Time-corresponding plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were abnormally high in 61% and 86% of patients respectively. These high values of catecholamines were not, however, specific to systolic hypertension. On the contrary, an inverse correlation was observed between systolic blood pressure and plasma epinephrine value. It appeared that the anxiety and stress of chest pain do not contribute to raising blood pressure through catecholamine liberation. In the high pressure group (SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg), only 3 of 16 patients were classified into severer grades (III or IV) of Killip's classification. This proved to be statistically significant. A similar result was obtained in Lown's grading. Only 1 of 16 patients showed severe ventricular tachyarrhythmia. It appeared obvious from these data that patients who showed initial systolic hypertension are well protected from severe congestive heart failure and from life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

At ten to thirty seconds after infusion, coronary blood flow reached 154 +/- 38% (mean +/- SD) of the baseline resting flow (p less than 0.001). The double product, an estimate of myocardial oxygen demand, decreased from a baseline value of 9221 +/- 2174 to 8008 +/- 1923 mmHg beats/min (p less than 0.01). Sixty seconds postinfusion myocardial function decreased from baseline wall thickening of 46 +/- 25% to 41 +/- 17% (p = 0.04). An acute bolus of lidocaine appears to transiently increase coronary blood flow, by decreasing coronary vascular resistance, and also decrease myocardial function. Thus, an acute lidocaine bolus may favorably alter the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio.\r"

In 2 patients, a routine angiogram was performed two to six months after graft dilatation and in both the grafts were patent. Another patient, initially successfully dilated, had recurrent angina and restenosis of the proximal anastomosis ten months after angioplasty; this was successfully redilated. Angioplasty of acutely or recently totally occluded coronary vein grafts is feasible and improves angina when present. Additional thrombolytic therapy prevents embolization.\r"

  ".W": "Many nonhealing tissues are hypoxic, with oxygen tensions frequently ranging from 5 to 15 mmHg. In such an environment, the normal wound healing sequence is disrupted or halted and phagocytic killing activity depressed. So the adjunctive use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), based on physiologic data and clinical observations, can provide the substrate necessary to initiate and sustain the healing process. During a twelve-month period, 20 patients with a nonhealing wound were referred to the hyperbaric center: chronic arterial insufficiency ulcers in 9 cases, diabetic wounds (foot lesions) in 11 cases. Adjunctive HBO therapy, initiated twice a day, consisted of pure oxygen, 2.5 ATA, 90 min. The average length of sessions was 46 (15-108). Complete healing was observed in 15 of 20 cases. The wound management can be helped with the transcutaneous oxygen measurements under hyperbaric oxygen. The distal TCPO2 at 2.5 ATA pure oxygen is a reliable test to predict final outcome (healing or no change), when these values were not different in normal air and in normobaric oxygen: (table; see text) In hyperbaric oxygen therapy, when the distal TCPO2 value was inferior to 100 mmHg, all patients showed either no improvement or aggravation, and when the value was higher than 100 mmHg, wound healing was achieved with all patients.\r"

Treadmill exercise provoked reproducibly nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and salvos of ventricular premature contraction (VPC). QRS morphology of these ventricular arrhythmias showed left bundle branch block pattern and right axis deviation. Oral propranolol (20 mg) and diltiazem (90 mg) prevented exercise provocation of NSVT and VPC. However, oral mexiletine (200 mg) and procainamide (500 mg) could not prevent exercise provocation of these ventricular arrhythmias. No ventricular arrhythmias could be induced by any form of ventricular extrastimulations. Right ventricular pacing at a rate of 210 beats/minute provoked NSVT of which the QRS morphology was similar to that of exercise-induced NSVT. Triggered activity may be a possible electrophysiologic mechanism for exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in this patient, although other mechanisms such as reentry and enhanced automaticity could not be completely excluded.\r"

The deformability of both treated and untreated RBCs from both patient groups was assessed by ektacytometric analysis. In contrast to the in vitro effects of pentoxifylline on whole-blood filterability, the present results demonstrated no effect of pentoxifylline or metabolite on RBC deformability at any concentration or incubation time period. Pentoxifylline does not enhance RBC deformability following acute in vitro incubation, and this suggests the need for further evaluation of the mechanism of action of this drug.\r"

The present study was performed to supply data about the effect of noncardioselective beta-blockers on the stress of acute hospitalization. Of 2,989 patients acutely admitted to a 50-bed unit of general internal medicine in a 647-bed teaching hospital, 234 had used beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) for at least six weeks because of mild hypertension; 199 were evaluable, 56 using nonselective, 143 using selective beta-blockers. The authors found a marked pressor effect of noncardioselective beta-blockers as compared with selective (mean arterial pressure 125 versus 102 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). In the patients who could continue their outpatient medication this effect could be attributed to an overall increase of total peripheral resistance and disappeared within five days of admission. In the patients admitted because of unstable angina pectoris (nonselective n = 15, selective n = 48) myocardial oxygen demand as estimated by the double product (systolic blood pressure heart rate) was significantly higher in the nonselective group (12.926 versus 9.581 mmHg.beats/min, p less than 0.01). The present study supports the need for more controlled data to determine the ultimate place of noncardioselective beta-blockers in situations of increased sympathetic activity.\r"

Two types of visual field defects have been described in association with occipital lobe lesions: a monocular temporal crescentic defect if the lesion is anterior and a congruous homonymous hemianopsia if it is posterior. This patient seems to represent a variant of the latter. The most prominent difference with respect to quadrantanopsias resulting from lesions of the optic radiation is the high degree of congruity, especially in the central portion of the field. Association with nonocclusive vascular events related to vertebrobasilar hypoperfusion rather than embolization is also more common.\r"

The decrease of peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure was significant (p = 0.02) and comparable for the four drugs studied and varied between 15% and 23% for heart rate and between 15% and 20% for systolic blood pressure. Although no statistically significant difference was observed among the four drug regimens, the decrease of peak exercise heart rate was less pronounced with nebivolol than with the three reference beta-blocking agents. The ratio of the preejection period (PEPc) to the left ventricular ejection time (LVETc), an indirect measure of left ventricular performance, tended to increase with atenolol and propranolol and remained unchanged with pindolol. PEPc/LVETc progressively and significantly improved with nebivolol from a control value of 0.37 +/- 0.012 to 0.31 +/- 0.009 (p = 0.03) after seven days of treatment, owing to a decrease in PEPc and an increase in LVETc, suggestive of a combined effect both on preload and afterload. Postexercise LVETc, an index of the intrinsic positive inotropy of exercise, was significantly suppressed by atenolol, propranolol, and pindolol, but not during treating with nebivolol. These data suggest that nebivolol is a beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist with an unusual hemodynamic profile, probably improving left ventricular compliance.\r"

Terfenadine, pyrilamine, and diphenhydramine given as oral doses of 1 mg/kg two hours before aeroallergen challenge exerted weak or no inhibition of acute lung anaphylactic responses. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study showed that azelastine administered orally is capable of exerting antiasthmatic effects in both the central and peripheral airways of guinea pigs. This effect may be attributed to its ability to inhibit the formation or secretion of pharmacologic mediators (ie, histamine, LTC4/D4, .O2-) from inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".W": "Forty children underwent two different skin prick tests with allergen-coated Phazet needles and conventional skin prick tests using Pharmalgen extracts (100,000 BU/mL). Good correlation between both skin test methods was found with house dust mites (Rs = 0.61; P less than .001), timothy pollen (Rs = 0.77; P less than .001), and cat epithelium (Rs = 0.74, P less than .001). The correlation coefficient in the case of histamine was lower (Rs = 0.50; P less than .01) than that obtained from the allergens. Larger wheals were generated with Phazet than with conventional prick tests (median: 54.5 mm2 and 24.5 mm2, respectively; Wilcoxon signed rank test, P less than .0001). Comparison of wheal areas and specific IgE did not reveal large differences between the two skin test methods. In conclusion, Phazet, a recently introduced simple, standardized, skin prick test method can replace the conventional skin prick test for the most important allergens such as house dust mites, timothy pollen, and cat epithelium.\r"

The clinical importance of hyperthyroidism in asthma and in chronic urticaria has been demonstrated in several cases. These observations may be attributed to modulatory effects of thyroid hormones on mast cell releasability and/or on other target organs as blood vessels. To evaluate the effects of thyroid hormones on mast cell releasability and on the cutaneous vasculature, we analyzed the wheal and flare response to compound 48/80, to codeine, and to histamine in patients with hyperthyroidism and in a control group. No significant difference was found between the two groups. We could not demonstrate any in vivo effect of the thyrotoxic state on the cutaneous response to these substances.\r"

Twenty-seven patients with confined (abscess present) or free perforation were evaluated. The average age was 31 years and the mean duration of disease was four years. Only two of the 27 patients had had previous surgery. All patients presented with a combination of pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. Twenty-three patients were afebrile, 17 had abdominal tenderness, and 6 had an abdominal mass. The average serum albumin was 3.7, the average hematocrit was 35 per cent and the average WBC was 13,000. Radiologic tests were abnormal in 23 of the 27 patients. All patients had been on medical treatment for Crohn's disease, and 19 of 27 were on high-dose steroids at the time of surgery. Ten of the 27 had a bowel prep before surgery and all had preoperative and postoperative antibiotics. All patients were surgically managed by resection and primary anastomosis without proximal diversion or delayed reconstruction. Drains were used in one third of the patients. Intraoperative cultures revealed gram-negative rods with Escherichia coli, enterococcus, and Enterobacter the most common. One enterocutaneous fistula, two superficial wound infections, and one death were recorded. Based on these results, the authors believe that an aggressive one-stage surgical approach for these complicated problems can be recommended. The low morbidity and mortality justifies this approach that results in considerable improvement in lost work time, length of hospital stay, number of readmissions, and significant cost control.\r"

All patients underwent baseline duplex/OPG, which was repeated every six months until the endpoint, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). One hundred seven had arteriograms. Five classes were identified: class I (normal): 96/300 (32%), 79 of these were followed and one had TIA (1/79, 1.3%); class II (less than 50% stenosis): 118/300 (39%), 105 of these were followed, three had TIA, and one had CVA (4/105, 3.8%); class III (50-60% stenosis): 25/300 (8%), 21 were followed, one had TIA (1/21, 4.7%); class IV (more than 60% stenosis with negative OPG): 39/300 (13%), 34 were followed, three had TIA, and one had CVA (4/34, 11.7%); and class V (more than 60% stenosis with positive OPG): 22/300 (7%), 18 were followed, three had TIA, and one had CVA (4/18, 22.2%). Data was analyzed using chi-square with Yates correction. In conclusion, in ACB 32 per cent had no carotid stenosis and 39 per cent had minimal disease with minimal risk of TIA or stroke. Patients with the most severe stenoses (classes IV and V) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of TIA or CVA occurring during the follow-up period. This last group (class V) would be ideal for prophylactic carotid endarterectomy.\r"

All patients were treated by isolated regional perfusion and amputation of the involved digit, as well as regional lymph-node dissection where clinically indicated. The mean survival rate for all stages at five years was 35 per cent. Patients with stage I disease had the best survival rates, 61 per cent at five years and 54 per cent at ten years; however, patients with advanced disease, stage III (M.D. Anderson classification), had only a 17 per cent survival rate at five years and 8 per cent at 10 years. Women had slightly better survival rates than men, and patients with upper-limb lesions had the better prognosis.\r"

This protocol of tests was particularly useful for patients with posterior sites of injury. Patients with injury to multiple organ systems had a higher rate of infectious complications (48%) than those with single system injury (11% complication rate). Primary repair of colon, urologic and vascular injuries was safe even in patients with injury to multiple organ systems.\r"

One hundred patients were identified; 42 were treated by common bile duct exploration (CBDE) and 58 had endoscopic papillotomy with extraction of stones (EP) as their initial treatment. The two groups were similar in regards to age, but the CBDE group had more comorbid conditions (average 2.5/patient in CBDE vs 1.8/patient in EP) and a higher incidence of acute cholecystitis and/or cholangitis (74% of CBDE patients; 24% of EP patients). Successful extraction of all stones occurred in 79 per cent of CBDE patients and 90 per cent of EP patients. Of those patients with retained stones following CBDE, all were later extracted by EP. Of patients having EP as their initial procedure, 24 per cent required repeat endoscopic procedures for extraction of residual stones and only six patients (10.4%) required CBDE for retained stones. Morbidity was lower (10% vs 23%) and hospital stay shorter (3.6 days vs 10.4 days) in the EP than CBDE patients; thus, the two groups are not completely comparable. Mortality was similar in the two groups (1.7% EP, 2.3% CBDE).\r"

There were 1,342 biopsies during this interval in 933 patients with an overall mean age of 45.3 years. Malignancy was diagnosed in 197 patients (14.7%) with a mean age of 57.5 years, while the remaining patients with a benign diagnosis had a mean age of 43.2 years. There were 178 nonpalpable lesions (13.3%) and 22 malignancies were detected in this group (12.4%). Most (91%) of the nonpalpable malignancies were \"early\" (in situ and stage I), while 71 per cent of the palpable malignancies were \"advanced\" (stages II and III). Although the yearly number of biopsies remained constant, upward trends were demonstrated in the number of nonpalpable lesions biopsied, the proportion of malignancies detected among all biopsies, and in the yield of proliferative benign forms of breast disease, specifically those with atypia. These trends correlated with a sixfold increase in the yearly number of mammograms performed over the same time interval. These results suggest that a commitment to an expanded use of mammography and to an aggressive approach to breast biopsy can increase the detection of both early forms of breast carcinoma and those benign breast lesions that are known pathologic risk determinants for breast carcinoma. Such a commitment may influence the future survival of this population.\r"

The present study analyzes 103 consecutive patients with these wounds treated at a level I Trauma Center in a 14-year period (1975-1988). Twenty-seven patients died within 48 hours from extensive associated trauma (Abdominal Trauma Index [ATI] 46.7). The majority of the remaining 76 patients were treated by debridement and drainage. Nineteen patients with grade III injuries had distal pancreatectomy. Six patients with extensive combined pancreatoduodenal injuries had pancreatoduodenectomy. Pancreatoenteric anastomoses or duodenal diversion procedures rarely were used. Pancreatic complications included major fistulas in four patients (5%) and pancreatic abscess in nine patients (11%). Only one of the fistulas required subsequent fistulojejunostomy. Intra-abdominal abscesses occurred in 18 patients (23.6%), mostly in patients with associated colon injury (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that a conservative approach to penetrating pancreatic injuries yields optimal results and that associated colon injury is an important predeterminant for abscess formation.\r"

The ease, safety, and accuracy of diagnostic peritoneal lavage justify its continued use in evaluating these patients. Recent studies show computerized tomography (CT) can be highly accurate in detecting intra-abdominal injuries after blunt trauma. We reviewed our experience with diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) to evaluate whether the accuracy, safety, speed, and cost justified its continued use. Four hundred fifteen DPLs were performed on 414 patients from February 1, 1983, through December 31, 1987. All DPLs were done by the open technique. The lavage was considered grossly positive if 10 cc gross blood were aspirated. If there were greater than 100,000 red blood cells (RBC)/mm3, greater than 500 white blood cells (WBC)/mm3, elevated amylase or bilirubin, or bacteria or vegetable fibers the lavage was microscopically positive. There were no cases with elevated bilirubin, amylase, or presence of bacteria. All four cases with \"rare vegetable fibers\" were false positive. Six DPLs were for penetrating trauma to the lower chest or back. There were 291 negative lavages, including five false negatives (1%), and 124 positive DPLs, including seven false positives (2%), resulting in a crude accuracy of 97 percent. Three of the five false negative lavages had a ruptured diaphragm as the only intra-abdominal injury. There was one minor complication. DPL was usually performed in the trauma resuscitation room during the secondary survey. At our institution, the total fees for DPL are +185 less than the fees for CT. DPL is accurate, rapid, safe, and avoids the disruption of patient care that results in the radiology suite. DPL remains our procedure of choice for evaluating blunt abdominal trauma in the adult.\r"

DESIGN: Comparison of diagnostic tests with neurophysiologic testing. SETTING: Patients with upper extremity complaints of diverse causes referred to a neurophysiology laboratory for diagnostic studies. METHODS: Before nerve conduction testing, a history, demographic and physical examination data, and a hand pain diagram were obtained from each patient. Diagrams were categorized as indicating the classic carpal tunnel syndrome, or as probable, possible, or unlikely to indicate the carpal tunnel syndrome. Associations between clinical data and nerve conduction results were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 110 patients in the study, 44 (40%) had the carpal tunnel syndrome. Individually, the best predictors were hand pain diagram rating (positive predictive value, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.68) and Tinel sign (positive predictive value, 0.55, CI, 0.45 to 0.65). The combination of a positive Tinel sign and a probable or classic diagram rating had a positive predictive value of 0.71; CI, 0.53 to 0.85. Other findings from physical examination and the history were less useful. Just 9% of patients under 40 years of age with possible or unlikely diagram ratings had the carpal tunnel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: With the exceptions of age, Tinel sign, and hand pain diagram rating, findings from the physical examination and the history had limited diagnostic utility. Patients under 40 years of age with possible or unlikely diagram ratings were at low risk for the carpal tunnel syndrome. This finding, which should be confirmed in an independent population, suggests that subsets of patients may be managed without nerve conduction studies.\r"

DESIGN: Double-blind, Latin-square randomized, prospective measurement of the gastric pH, acid output, and plasma ranitidine concentration over 24 hours in response to six treatment regimens in 12 patients with inactive duodenal ulcer. Eight regional hospitals were surveyed to obtain information on the use of histamine H2-receptor antagonists. INTERVENTIONS: Gastric acid secretion, pH, and plasma ranitidine were monitored for 24 hours on six separate days in response to placebo, intravenous bolus injection of ranitidine (50 mg every 8 hours and 75 mg every 12 hours), and continuous intravenous infusion of ranitidine (75, 150, and 300 mg every 24 hours). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intravenous infusions were significantly more effective than bolus injections. After bolus injections, hourly gastric pH values fluctuated widely, from 7.6 to 1.6, whereas during continuous infusion of 150 mg and 300 mg, hourly pH values were 3.8 or greater. The gastric pH was greater than 4.0 in 75% +/- 5% and 83% +/- 6% of determinations done during continuous intravenous infusion of 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Fluctuations in the plasma ranitidine concentration corresponded with changes in gastric pH and acid secretion. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists were prescribed for about 75% of patients in intensive care units and were most commonly administered by bolus rather than infusion (5:1); the cost was approximately +40 per day less by infusion. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of both efficacy and cost, intermittent bolus injections should be discontinued and replaced by continuous intravenous infusion in hospitalized patients requiring treatment with histamine H2-receptor antagonists. If ranitidine is used, either 150 mg or 300 mg administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion is most effective.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-one residents were examined for carotid bruits and signs of previous stroke. The mean age of the residents was 86 years. Twelve percent of residents had asymptomatic carotid bruits. The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid bruits was 8% in residents who were 75 to 84 years of age, 10% in residents who were 85 to 94 years of age, and 13% in residents who were at least 95 years old. Interval cerebrovascular events and cause of death were ascertained from chart review, and recorded events in survivors were confirmed by a repeat examination. The 3-year cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular events in asymptomatic residents with carotid bruits was 10%, compared with 9% in residents without carotid bruits, yielding a relative risk of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.45 to 2.7). In 60% of surviving residents, baseline carotid bruits were no longer present at the time of follow-up examination. The disappearance of these bruits was not associated with the occurrence of interval cerebrovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid bruits increases with advanced age. Carotid bruits do not greatly increase the risk for subsequent stroke in elderly patients. Carotid bruits may often disappear without clinical sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the cases of four women who developed a scleroderma-like syndrome during L-tryptophan treatment for insomnia or tinnitus. The illness was characterized by swelling of the extremities, skin rash, myalgia, and elevation of the peripheral blood eosinophil count, followed by rapidly progressive cutaneous and subcutaneous induration. The histopathologic examination of affected skin showed thickening of the fascia, deep dermal fibrosis, and accumulation of mononuclear cells and abundant eosinophils. The expression of the type I procollagen gene was examined by in-situ hybridizations of affected skin with a human sequence-specific complementary DNA (cDNA). Increased hybridization signals were detected in the deep dermis and fascia, indicating enhanced expression of the collagen gene. The temporal association of L-tryptophan use and the development of a scleroderma-like illness in these four patients suggests a causal relation between L-tryptophan or its metabolites and the stimulation of fibroblast collagen gene expression that results in dermal and fascial fibrosis.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and search of the North Carolina Driver History file. SETTING: Emergency departments of a university and affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients at the university (n = 1554) and VAMC (n = 1461) emergency departments. Patients with presumed alcohol-induced impairment (university, 75; VAMC, 88) who did not require hospital admission were identified. Presumed alcohol-induced impairment was defined by any of the following: nurse or physician note specifying the patient was intoxicated; indication in the medical record that the patient had alcohol on their breath; claim by the patient of alcohol use the day of evaluation; or measurement of blood alcohol concentration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood alcohol concentrations were measured in 80% of presumed alcohol-impaired university patients (median blood alcohol concentration, 45 mmol/L) and 68% of VAMC patients (median blood alcohol concentration, 58 mmol/L). Driving skills deteriorate with blood alcohol concentrations of 11 mmol/L or greater; however, 63% of university and 88% of VAMC patients with measured blood alcohol concentrations of 11 mmol/L or greater were still impaired when discharged. Only 3.5% of university and 8.7% of VAMC patients impaired at discharge were advised not to drive, whereas 31% of university and 20% of VAMC patients impaired at discharge were supervised by a responsible person. The prevalence of previous driving-while-impaired convictions was high (university, 34%; VAMC, 58%). CONCLUSIONS: Presumed alcohol-impaired patients seen in emergency departments frequently have blood alcohol concentrations measured. Despite documented evidence of driving impairment there is little evidence that such patients are counseled not to drive or that safe transportation home is available.\r"

All infants were examined daily while in hospital and allocated a score based upon a subjective assessment of the severity of their illness. There was no significant correlation between interferon, virus, or fusion (F) protein secretion and severity of illness or age of infant. It is concluded that poor interferon alfa secretion does not underly the susceptibility of infants to severe infections with this virus.\r"

Less than a quarter of the infants showed rising IgG antibody titres to either glycoprotein after infection, whereas over threequarters produced an IgM response. There was a significant correlation between IgG response to viral glycoproteins and the age of the infant. The correlation of age with the IgM response was less pronounced, and there was no correlation between serum IgG antibody derived transplancentally in the acute phase of infection and IgM response to either glycoprotein. Neither IgG or IgM responses correlated with a clinical assessment of the severity of infection in the infants.

This paper describes the effects that differences in the distribution of whey proteins and caseins exert on the faecal flora. Faecal flora was examined in 33 babies receiving a whey formula, 29 babies receiving a casein formula, and 38 breast fed babies. Subsequently fewer babies in each group were studied at weeks 7, 11, and 15. More whey fed babies were colonised with bifidobacteria at 14 days compared with the casein fed group, more casein fed babies were colonised with bacteroides (at 14 days), and more had a dominant growth of enterococci (at week 7). It seems therefore that during the first two months that the whey predominant formula induced a faecal flora generally closer to that of breast fed babies than did a casein formula.\r"

Thus 12 out of 66 children (18%) with severe eczema experienced prolonged and useful benefit from this dietary manoeuvre. Double blind food challenges performed in 10 patients failed to establish that parental identification of provoking foods is reliable. A search for historical and in vitro predictors of diet responsiveness was unsuccessful in this series.\r"

Thirteen additional cases of type II hyperprolinaemia were discovered; all were offspring of consanguineous unions. A further 50 subjects were found to have mild hyperprolinaemia. We found a strong association between type II hyperprolinaemia and seizures during childhood but no significant association with mental handicap. Most adults with type II hyperprolinaemia enjoyed normal health and there was no evidence that maternal hyperprolinaemia compromised fetal development. The documented association between type II hyperprolinaemia and seizures may be related to the neuromodulatory or reducing-oxidising effects of proline and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, respectively, that has been shown in vitro. Alternatively, another genetic defect closely linked to the type II hyperprolinaemia allele could be the explanation.\r"

Five babies were studied in detail with blood samples taken for cortisol concentrations at 30 minute intervals for four hours. The tests were performed before, during, and after treatment with dexamethasone. A distinctive pattern of cortisol response to tetracosactrin was found among these babies, which was quite unlike that found in older children and adults. Using our pretreatment results as control data we conclude that there is undoubtedly evidence of modest suppression of the adrenal axis during dexamethasone treatment, although there is considerable recovery one month after stopping steroids. Basal cortisol concentrations, however, remained low in some cases, which may indicate the need for temporary corticosteroid replacement during severe illness.\r"

Emotional disorders were the commonest psychiatric diagnoses (present in two thirds); less frequent diagnoses were conduct disorders (5/36, 14%), mixed conduct/emotional disorders (six, 17%), and hyperkinetic syndrome (three, 8%). Disturbance was related to level of energy, with disturbed children being described significantly more frequently as 'bounding with energy' or conversely 'tired and apathetic'. Psychosocial problems (broken homes, mentally distressed mothers, family stress including financial stress and marital difficulty) were also increased in the disturbed group, but most of all these mothers reported feeling stressed in relation to the children. Psychiatric disorders, particularly emotional disorders, are common associated problems in paediatric referrals. Family stress, specially that focused on parenting, is likely to be an important factor contributing to disturbed children's consultations in general paediatric clinics.\r"

Pulmonary artery pressure was assessed by its inverse relationship with the ratio of pulmonary artery time to peak velocity and right ventricular ejection time measured from Doppler waveform. Patency of the ductus arteriosus and interatrial shunting were assessed by imaging and Doppler ultrasound. The ratio rose after birth in all infants; it rose more slowly in the preterm infants. After 6 hours of age the mean was significantly less in the preterm group, the greatest difference being between 25 and 36 hours. By 73 to 96 hours the difference was no longer significant. There was a trend towards later ductal closure in the preterm infants but this was not significant. Atrial shunting level varied, but some left to right shunting was seen in all infants satisfactorily studied. Pulmonary artery pressure seems to fall more slowly after preterm birth even in the absence of respiratory problems, but ductal shunting persisting for more than three days is unusual in healthy preterm infants.\r"

It was shown that a given ratio corresponded to the same birth centile across the gestational age range studied; a ratio of 0.8 corresponding to the 10th centile. There was a linear relationship between birthweight ratio and requirement for mechanical ventilation and postneonatal mortality. Birthweight ratio was also strongly and linearly related to body weight, length, and head circumference at 18 months' corrected age. Overall, there was no association between this ratio and neurodevelopmental outcome to 18 months. However, the subgroup with the largest weights for gestation (birthweight ratio greater than or equal to 1.1), had significantly higher language subscores than all the other children. Our data show that conventional dichotomous categorisation of preterm infants into small or appropriate for gestation is inadequate when exploring the association between size for gestation and outcome.\r"

The pupillary light reflex was absent in all neonates of less than 30 weeks' gestational age, it gradually developed from this age and by 35 weeks it was present in all. Several possible mechanisms that may explain the onset of this reflex are considered. Before the onset of the pupil reflex mean horizontal pupillary diameter was 3.46 mm compared with 3.02 mm after the reflex development. We have estimated the amount of light reaching the retina (retinal irradiance) for preterm neonates and although it is less than that known to cause retinal damage in animals, further research is necessary to determine whether early light exposure has an adverse or beneficial effect on the immature visual system.\r"

There was close linkage of fetal eye movements, somatic movements and heart rate pattern reflecting three different states. Quiescence (state 1F) was characterised by no eye movements, no somatic movements except for the occasional startle, and a fetal heart rate pattern with little baseline variability. There were two active states: state 2F characterised by continuous eye movements, frequent bursts of somatic movements, and wide baseline variability with accelerations with movement, and state 4F characterised by continuous eye movements with almost continuous somatic movements and a sustained tachycardia. These fulfilled criteria for three of four behavioural states previously described in human fetuses. Cycling of quiescent and active states occurred in 77 (96%) of the fetuses within 100 minutes of starting the recording. 2F was the commonest behavioural state, being seen 58% of the time. 1F was seen 30% of the time, and 4F 9% of the time. During the remaining 3% of observation time the behavioural state was indeterminate.\r"

Ten patients (14%) with wound complications died of multi-system failure. Only the patients with negative cultures fared well; of the bacterial culture categories, polymicrobial infection carried the worst prognosis. Effects of recurring infection were seen throughout the first year. Patients, grouped according to conduits received, experienced these wound complication rates: vein grafts only, 11/1,085 (1.0%); one internal thoracic artery, 38/4,073 (0.9%); and bilateral internal thoracic artery grafts, 23/1,346 (1.7%). There were no significant differences in wound complication rates between primary and reoperation patients or among conduit groups. By logistic regression analysis, the relative risk for patients with diabetes and bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting was 5.00 (95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 10.5). Operation time as a continuous variable increased the relative risk of wound complication 1.47 times per hour (1.3 to 1.7); obesity, 2.90 times (1.8 to 4.8); and blood units as continuous variable, 1.05 times per unit (1.01 to 1.10). Bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting in nondiabetic patients carried no greater risk of wound complication than that in patients with vein grafts only or with one internal thoracic artery graft.\r"

The present study was undertaken to assess the results of LIMA grafting in the elderly. From 1980 through 1988, 723 patients 70 years of age or older had isolated coronary artery bypass grafting performed. During the first 5 years, only 11% of the elderly patients received LIMA grafts, whereas 86% having coronary artery bypass grafting since 1985 had LIMA grafts. Since 1986, LIMA use in the elderly has become routine, with 92% of patients receiving internal mammary artery grafts. During the first 5 years, elderly patients had a hospital mortality rate of 9.3%. Since 1985, the hospital mortality rate fell to 5.5%. In addition, the occurrence of major surgical complications was either unchanged or reduced in patients receiving LIMA grafts. Furthermore, late follow-up indicates a significantly improved 4-year survival rate in patients with internal mammary artery grafts compared with those without: 86 +/- 0.02% versus 77 +/- 0.03% (p less than 0.01). Analysis of multiple potential risk factors for early mortality was performed using multiple logistic regression and late survival using the Cox proportional hazards model. Although unmeasured predictor variables may confound retrospective analyses, LIMA grafting appears to be an independent predictor both of improved early and late survival.\r"

  ".W": "The internal mammary artery (IMA) is being recognized as the conduit of choice for myocardial revascularization. From January 1972 through June 1988, 1,087 patients received bilateral IMA and supplemental vein grafts. There were 917 men (84.4%) and 170 women (15.6%) with a mean age of 62.4 years (range, 29 to 84 years). Three hundred ninety-four patients (36.2%) had unstable angina, and 194 (17.8%) had left main coronary artery stenosis greater than 50%. In all, 3,741 coronary grafts were performed, with a mean of 3.4 per patient. Hospital mortality was 2.7% (29 patients). Hospital complications included reoperation for bleeding, 19 patients (1.7%); sternal infection, 16 patients (1.5%); respiratory failure, 35 patients (3.2%); perioperative myocardial infarction, 22 patients (2.0%); and stroke, 20 patients (1.8%). Post-operative arteriography in 53 patients (mean postoperative time, 53.0 months) showed that 92.1% (58/63) of the left IMA and 84.9% (45/53) of the right IMA grafts were patent. Follow-up was completed on 1,058 hospital survivors. There were 82 late deaths (7.8%). The actuarial survival for patients discharged from the hospital was 80.0 +/- 3.2% (plus or minus standard error of the mean) at 10 years and 60.0% +/- 5.0% at 15 years. At follow-up, 866 patients (90.3%) were asymptomatic and in New York Heart Association class I and 68 (7.1%) were in class II. This longitudinal analysis demonstrates that bilateral IMA grafting has a low operative risk and provides excellent long-term functional improvement and survival.\r"

The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, risk factors for coronary artery disease, angina class, extent of coronary artery disease, left ventricular function, number of coronary bypass grafts performed, and completeness of revascularization. Single ITA operative mortality was 2% and double ITA, 9% (p = NS). The mean follow-up of hospital survivors was 14.4 +/- 2.7 years; all but 7 patients had follow-up for at least 10 years. At 13 years, the actuarial patency of the right ITA was 85% and the left ITA, 82%. These data strongly suggest a survival benefit for patients with double ITA grafts among hospital survivors (74% versus 59%; p = 0.05). Patients receiving two ITA grafts had a significant freedom from subsequent myocardial infarction (75% versus 59%, p less than 0.025), recurrent angina pectoris (36% versus 27%, p less than 0.025), and subsequent total ischemic events (32% versus 18%, p less than 0.01). These data also suggest improved freedom from coronary artery interventional therapy (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and reoperation) when two ITA grafts were used. These results support the use of bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting in selected patients.\r"

During a 42-month interval ending July 1988, 1,566 patients had coronary artery bypass grafting alone or in combination with other procedures: 633 received only vein grafts, 687 had unilateral IMA grafting, and 246 had bilateral IMA grafting. The IMA patients were younger, were more often male, had better cardiac function, and underwent fewer emergent, urgent, or combined procedures than the patients receiving vein grafts (p less than 0.05). Thirty-day mortality was lower among the IMA patients (unilateral IMA group, 2.8%; bilateral IMA group, 3.7%; and vein graft group, 7.9%; p = 0.001). With the exception of sternal wound problems, occurrence rates for postoperative complications among the IMA patients did not differ significantly from or were lower (p less than 0.05) than those among the patients with vein grafts. Sternal infections occurred with greater frequency among the bilateral IMA patients (6.9%) than among the unilateral IMA (1.9%) or vein graft (1.3%) patients (p = 0.001). By univariate analysis, obesity, diabetes, bilateral IMA grafting, and need for prolonged (greater than 48 hours) mechanical ventilation were associated with a significantly higher incidence of sternal infection (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recipient and donor HLA matching were analyzed retrospectively in 51 patients undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Immunosuppression was based on cyclosporine and prednisone. During the mean follow-up of 34 months (range, 16 to 63 months), the 46 operative survivors had an average of 3.95 rejection episodes (range, zero to 11 episodes). Twenty-one patients had steroid-resistant rejection requiring treatment with polyclonal or monoclonal antithymocyte globulin. Human lymphocyte antigen typing was available for 44 patients, and antigens were grouped in broad specificities. Patients with two or more HLA-A or HLA-B matches had a reduced number of rejection episodes (3/10 versus 19/34) and a lower incidence of steroid-resistant rejection (1/10 versus 18/34; p = 0.01). Inclusion of HLA-DR matches did not alter the findings. There was a strong correlation between the increased frequency of rejection and the incidence of steroid-resistant rejection (p less than 0.0001). Four of six late deaths occurred in patients with steroid-resistant rejection; four were due to acute rejection and two to graft atherosclerosis. Although not currently done, prospective HLA matching is feasible with present typing methods. Our results suggest a rationale for prospective histocompatibility testing in cardiac transplantation with allocation of donor hearts to patients with two or more HLA matches.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of skeletal muscle contractile force to augment left ventricular function has been demonstrated experimentally and clinically by the cardiomyoplasty procedure. Another approach in biomechanical cardiac assistance is the use of electrostimulated skeletal muscle in an extracardiac position. We describe an autologous counterpulsating device using the native ascending aorta as a ventricular chamber wrapped by an electrostimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap (LDMF). This model avoids thrombotic complications observed in skeletal muscle neo-ventricles associated with prosthetic chambers. In 8 goats, a right LDMF was transferred to the thoracic cavity by removal of the second rib. In 4 goats, the diameter of the aorta was enlarged by surgical implantation (using lateral clamping) of an autologous pericardial patch. The LDMF was wrapped around the ascending aorta and electrostimulated using an external diastolic pulse generator connected to a sensing myocardial lead and to LDMF pacing electrodes. Hemodynamic studies were performed (left ventricular, aortic, and pulmonary artery pressures and rate of rise of left ventricular pressure). The LDMF diastolic counterpulsation was performed using a burst of 30 Hz, with a delay from the R wave adjusted to provide optimal diastolic augmentation. Percent increase in the subendocardial viability index was calculated during unassisted and assisted cardiac cycles (1:2) at baseline and after acute heart failure induced by the administration of high doses of propranolol hydrochloride (3 mg/kg intravenously). Diastolic aortic counterpulsation by the stimulated LDMF resulted in a significant improvement in the subendocardial viability index both at baseline and after induced cardiac failure in both groups, though the increase was greater in the group with aortic enlargement.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the propagation of electrical activation in the atrial septum, atrial epicardial and atrial septal maps were recorded intraoperatively using a 156-channel computerized mapping system in 12 patients during sinus rhythm (n = 10), supraventricular tachycardia associated with septal pathways in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (n = 3), atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia (n = 4), and atrial flutter (n = 5). The epicardial and septal data were recorded simultaneously from 156 atrial electrodes, digitized, analyzed, and displayed as isochronous maps on a two-dimensional diagram of the atria. During sinus rhythm, the activation wave fronts propagated most rapidly along the large muscle bundles of the atrial septum. During supraventricular tachycardia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the earliest site of retrograde atrial activation usually corresponded to the position of atrial insertion of the septal pathways. However, the earliest site of activation during orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia was different from that during ventricular pacing in 1 patient with a posterior septal accessory pathway localized by the epicardial mapping study. The data document the rationale for dividing the ventricular end of the accessory pathways (ie, the endocardial technique) rather than the atrial end (ie, the epicardial technique) in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. During AV node reentrant tachycardia, atrial activation data suggested that atrial tissue lying outside the confines of the anatomical AV node is a necessary link in this common arrhythmia. Thus, these atrial septal maps explain why surgical dissection, or properly positioned small cryolesions placed in the region of the AV node, can ablate AV node reentrant tachycardia without altering normal AV node function. The maps recorded during atrial flutter suggest the importance of the atrial septum as one limb of a macroreentrant circuit responsible for the arrhythmia, and imply that atrial flutter is amenable to control by surgical techniques. These studies demonstrate the details of normal atrial septal activation, the importance of the atrial septum in a variety of different atrial arrhythmias, and the basis of and potential for surgical ablation of the most common types of supraventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Unilateral diaphragmatic plication was performed on 17 patients (16 men and 1 woman with a mean age of 53.7 years [range, 28 to 74 years]) during the last 10 years. Preoperatively each patient was shown to have paradoxical movement of the paralyzed diaphragm on sniffing and to have a reduction in forced vital capacity and lung volumes. These reductions were greater when the patient was in the supine position. All patients had moderate hypoxemia (mean arterial oxygen tension, 73.1 +/- 10.9 mm Hg). Plication was performed by imbricating the diaphragm in layers through a thoracotomy incision. After plication, all patients showed both subjective and objective improvement. Six patients were reassessed 5 or more years after plication (range, 5 to 7 years), and the improvement was maintained. Diaphragmatic plication is a safe and effective procedure for adult patients with dyspnea due to unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis; furthermore, the initial improvement is maintained.\r"

  ".W": "From 1979 to 1989, 18 patients were seen in the Electrophysiology Service, Duke University Medical Center, with automatic atrial tachycardia. There were 8 male and 10 female patients with a mean age of 28.1 +/- 2.9 years. Electrophysiological mapping localized automatic foci to right atrial sites (14 patients) and left atrial sites (4 patients). Depending on origin of the focus, patients were further diagnosed as having either chronic ectopic atrial tachycardia or inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Of the 15 patients with chronic ectopic atrial tachycardia, 6 responded to medical treatment; in 9, the tachycardia was not adequately controlled. Six of them were referred for surgical intervention. All 3 patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia underwent operative therapy. In the surgical group of patients with chronic ectopic atrial tachycardia, all 6 had a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with ejection fractions ranging from 14% to 27% (mean ejection fraction, 21% +/- 2.7%). Surgical techniques used (alone or in combination) included an isolation procedure in 1 patient, cryoablation in 4 patients, and excision of atrial appendages or portions of atrial free walls in 7. Normal sinus rhythm developed in all surgical patients except 1 patient who had intractable congestive heart failure preoperatively and died of this condition and stroke. The overall success rates for medical and surgical therapy were 33.3% and 88.9%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Long-term follow-up was possible for 7 (87.5%) of 8 patients 3 to 7 years after operation. All patients with chronic ectopic atrial tachycardia were cured, but only 1 of 3 patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia was in sinus rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between July 1987 and March 1989, 11 patients underwent left ventricular support with the Novacor left ventricular assist system irrespective of apparent degree of right ventricular failure. The first 2 patients died of multisystem organ failure while on support. All the remaining patients survived the support period, and actuarial survival after transplantation was 100% at 6 months and 89% at 1 year. In no patient did bacterial infection develop during support or after transplantation. Right ventricular ejection fraction before implantation of the left ventricular assist system was lower than 15% in 6 of 8 patients, yet it increased twofold during left ventricular support. The need for excessive inotropic support (2 patients) or temporary (four days) mechanical right ventricular support (2 patients) while on the left ventricular support system appeared to be related to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance during support in association with large preimplantation ventricular volumes. It appears that even patients with compromised right ventricular performance can be supported long term with a left ventricular assist device. Patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance may require temporary right ventricular support.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated our recent experience with management of neonatal critical pulmonic stenosis and intact ventricular septum between 1982 and 1988. Thirty-nine patients (aged less than 3 months) were treated initially by operation (group A, n = 19) or with balloon pulmonary valvotomy (group B, n = 20). Patients in group A were younger (5 +/- 1.3 versus 18 +/- 4 days in group B) (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and had a greater degree of hypoxia (oxygen tension, 55 +/- 4 versus 80 +/- 6 mm Hg) (p less than 0.05 for all variables). Ten patients in group A and 8 patients in group B had right ventricular hypoplasia, based on an angiographically determined index. Balloon pulmonary valvotomy was attempted in 20 patients at the time of the initial catheterization but was unsuccessful in 9 owing to inability to catheterize the hypoplastic right ventricular outflow tract (n = 8) and to recurrent infundibular stenosis (n = 1). Patients with failed balloon valvotomy were subsequently operated on within 24 hours. The early operative mortality (less than 30 days) was 25% (7 of 28); one death (9%) occurred after successful balloon valvotomy owing to associated critical aortic stenosis. The early postoperative gradient was 20 +/- 2 mm Hg; the post-balloon valvotomy gradient was 18 +/- 3 mm Hg. We conclude that balloon pulmonary valvotomy yields good results in patients with critical pulmonary stenosis with essentially normal-sized right ventricle, whereas surgical pulmonary valvotomy is required for patients with right ventricular hypoplasia.\r"

  ".U": "90165562\r", 
  ".W": "Complement activation is believed to be of importance in the development of complications arising after cardiopulmonary bypass. The effect on complement activation of priming the extracorporeal circuit with crystalloid alone, crystalloid plus albumin, or crystalloid plus the plasma expander polygeline was assessed in 36 patients undergoing coronary artery operations with cardiopulmonary bypass using a bubble oxygenator. Activation of the alternative and common complement pathways was monitored before, during, and after the bypass period by measuring concentrations of factor B and its fragment Ba and C3 and its fragment C3d. Complement activation occurred in all three groups of patients, with no difference between the crystalloid and crystalloid-albumin groups. In contrast, Ba fragment concentrations were persistently and significantly lower during and after bypass in the polygeline group, denoting reduced complement activation. C3d levels also showed a tendency to be lower in this group. Our results indicate that addition of polygeline to the priming solution reduces complement activation. Because complement activation is associated with morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass, addition of polygeline to the priming solution may offer an inexpensive method of reducing morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to sex ratio, site and length of the lesion, gross types, histological grade, depth of tumor invasion, vessel permeation, lymph node metastasis, TNM classification, incidence of incomplete resection, or crude actuarial 5-year survival curves. The malignant potentiality of the esophageal carcinoma in young patients did not differ from that in older patients in terms of deoxyribonucleic acid distribution pattern. The only difference clearly evident between young and older patients was the number of hospital deaths due to complications: That of the young patients was significantly lower than that of the older patients (p less than 0.05). Esophageal carcinoma in persons aged less than 50 years appeared to behave biologically like the same neoplasm in older people, whereas gastric and colorectal carcinomas behave differently in various age groups.\r"

  ".W": "The Hemopump, a catheter-mounted, temporary ventricular assist device, consists of an external electromechanical drive console and a disposable, intraarterial axial-flow pump (21F). Power is transmitted percutaneously to the pump by a flexible drive shaft within the catheter. The device is positioned in the left ventricle by way of the femoral artery approach or through the ascending aorta. Blood is drawn from the left ventricle through the transvalvular inlet cannula and pumped into the aorta. As of December 1988, the Hemopump had successfully supported the circulation of 7 patients (5 men, 2 women) ranging in age from 44 to 72 years (mean age, 59 years) and suffering from cardiogenic shock (cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min/m2). Indications for use included failure to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass in 4 patients, acute myocardial infarction in 1, severe cardiac allograft rejection in 1, and donor heart failure in 1. Duration of support ranged from 26 to 113 hours (mean, 66 hours). Although 5 patients demonstrated transient hemolysis, none experienced infection, thrombosis, or vascular injury. Hemodynamic variables improved in all patients during support by the device. As of December 1988, 5 of the 7 patients were alive more than 30 days after support had been discontinued, and 3 of these patients were discharged from the hospital. On the basis of our initial clinical results, the Hemopump, which does not require a major surgical procedure for insertion, provides effective, temporary circulatory support in patients with potentially reversible cardiac failure.\r"

We have used positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride to examine central D2 dopamine receptor binding in 20 healthy subjects and 18 newly admitted, young, neuroleptic-naive patients with schizophrenia. An in vivo saturation procedure was applied for quantitative determination of D2 dopamine receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd). When the two groups were compared, no significant difference in Bmax or Kd values was found in the putamen or the caudate nucleus. The hypothesis of generally elevated central D2 dopamine receptor densities in schizophrenia was thus not supported by the present findings. In the patients but not in the healthy controls, significantly higher densities were found in the left than in the right putamen but not in the caudate nucleus.\r"

In 1984, we studied three retired teachers who had extensive deep white-matter brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, yet functioned cognitively at an above-average level. Blinded review of 1981 computed tomographic scans revealed patchy white-matter lucencies for two of the subjects. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging in 1987 showed that the deep white-matter brain lesions were at least as extensive as in the initial study. One subject had developed renal failure, while the other two continued to function at a high level with no evidence of cognitive decline or psychiatric or neurologic impairment. The presence of extensive deep white-matter brain lesions for up to 7 years in two subjects whose cognitive, behavioral, and neurologic functioning is unimpaired suggests that deep white-matter brain lesions do not necessarily indicate a clinically significant central nervous system disease process.\r"

Results showed that patients who formed good alliances with their therapists within the first 6 months of treatment were significantly more likely to remain in psychotherapy, comply with their prescribed medication regimens, and achieve better outcomes after 2 years, with less medication, than patients who did not. These results underscored the prognostic value of assessing the alliance and the need to identify factors that contribute to its development and maintenance with schizophrenic patients.\r"

Respondents were asked about the presence of five pain conditions and were classified empirically in terms of dysfunctional chronic pain status based on pain severity, pain persistence, and pain-related disability days. Logistic regression analyses revealed a highly significant association between number of pain conditions reported and elevated levels of somatization as measured by the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised. Individuals with two or more pain conditions were at elevated risk of an algorithm diagnosis of major depression, while persons with a single pain condition did not differ from persons with no current pain conditions. Number of pain conditions reported was a better predictor of major depression than were important measures of pain experience, including pain severity and pain persistence.\r"

A consecutive series of 24 patients who met criteria for major depression only were compared with 6 patients who met criteria for both major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and 45 patients who did not meet criteria for either major depression of generalized anxiety. Among patients with positive computed tomographic scans, the anxious-depressed group (n = 19) showed a significantly higher frequency of cortical lesions, while patients with major depression only (n = 15) had a significantly higher frequency of subcortical (basal ganglia) strokes. No significant between-group differences were found in other variables, such as demographic variables, familial and personal history of psychiatric disorders, and neurologic deficits. These findings suggest that, in this mostly black, low-socioeconomic-status population, cortical vs subcortical lesion location may play an important role in determining whether severe anxiety occurs in patients with post-stroke major depression.\r"

Female relatives were more likely to be affected than male relatives (48% vs 13%), though this difference did not reach conventional significance in an age-corrected analysis. Significant between-group differences were not found in risks for (1) other anxiety, affective, and substance abuse disorders, and (2) simple irrational fears that did not meet disorder criteria. The results suggest that simple phobia is a highly familial disorder that does not transmit increased risk for other phobic or anxiety disorders. The specificity of increased risk among the relatives of simple phobics is consistent with the distinction between simple phobia, social phobia, and agoraphobia. However, complete delineation of the transmissional relationship between these illnesses requires assessment of the extent to which risk for simple phobia can be transmitted by individuals with other phobic or anxiety disorders. Replication of these preliminary findings in larger clinically and epidemiologically selected samples is needed.\r"

In 1986, the Centers for Disease Control designed the Model Performance Evaluation Program to assess and improve the analytic quality of HIV-1 antibody testing. In addition, the program was designed to gather information about HIV-1 antibody testing practices. The utility of this information is in identifying potential barriers to quality throughout the total testing process. Currently, 1405 laboratories participate in the program. Participating laboratories are located both within and outside the United States and consist primarily of hospitals, blood banks, health departments, and independent laboratories. The responses to a questionnaire completed by 1050 program-participant laboratories in September 1988 suggest that at several stages in the HIV-1 antibody total testing process, laboratory practices (including the interpretation of Western blot patterns) are variable and that standardization of these practices would improve quality.\r"

Transfusions are required when symptoms become severe. Chemotherapy of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is also cytotoxic and further contributes to the transfusion requirement. Patients with AIDS receiving treatment with zidovudine, in particular, have a high transfusion requirement. Empirically, many centers irradiate blood products transfused to AIDS patients to prevent possible graft-vs-host reaction in the immunologically compromised recipient. Attempts to correct the deficiency of helper T cells with lymphocyte transfusion and marrow transplantation have so far been ineffective. Similarly, therapeutic trials to treat this disease by apheresis of virus-bearing cells has been ineffective and has, therefore, been abandoned.\r"

A model consistently producing seromas was developed by radical mastectomy and lymphadenectomy in the Sprague-Dawley rat. A fibrin glue application procedure was tested using this model. The double-blinded protocol called for spray application of saline or fibrin glue to mastectomy wounds followed by sequential inspection and necropsy on postoperative days 5, 8, 11, and 14. Topical fibrin glue was shown to be statistically significant in decreasing the presentation of seromas following a radical mastectomy in the Sprague-Dawley rat.\r"

Therapy, patterns of failure, and survival were retrospectively examined in 32 patients with anorectal melanoma. Twenty-six patients were treated surgically, 14 with abdominoperineal resection and 12 with local excision. Local recurrence occurred less frequently in patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection (4 [29%] of 14) compared with patients undergoing local excision (7 [58%] of 12) but developed concomitantly with distant or regional metastasis in all but 2 of the 11 patients whose operations failed locally. Inguinal nodal disease developed in 15 patients (47%). Pelvic nodal disease became apparent in only 2 patients (7%). There was no difference in overall survival between the two surgically treated groups (median survival, 19.5 months for patients treated with abdominoperineal resection vs 18.9 months for patients treated with local excision). Therefore, local excision is recommended when technically feasible since these patients eventually succumb to metastasis regardless of surgical therapy.\r"

No significant difference in disease-free or overall survival rates was found between patients treated with wide local excision with adjuvant isolated limb perfusion or wide local excision alone. However, a subset of patients with thicker lesions (greater than 2.0 mm) treated with wide local excision and isolated limb perfusion using melphalan had a significant improvement in both disease-free and overall survival rates. These data suggest that isolated limb perfusion using melphalan may improve survival rates in selected patients with localized melanoma of the extremity who are at increased risk for local and regional micrometastases, and justifies the continued study of this treatment approach in prospective clinical trials.\r"

Treatment in all cases was by wide excision with or without split-thickness skin graft; all patients underwent regional lymph node dissection. Overall survival rate for the group was 47% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years. Factors independently predictive of survival were pathologic negative nodes (71% at 5 years compared with 28% for pathologic positive nodes) and extremity site (58% at 5 years compared with 33% for truncal site). Patients with node-negative thick cutaneous melanoma of the extremity had a 5-year survival rate of 82%. Patients with node-positive truncal thick cutaneous melanoma had a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. There was no difference between the 5-year survival rate of patients with node-negative truncal thick cutaneous melanoma, 52%, and patients with node-positive thick cutaneous melanoma of the extremity, 42%. Nearly half of the patients with thick cutaneous melanoma of the extremity and trunk present with locoregional disease, at a stage when an aggressive surgical approach is warranted. Prognostic variables of pathologic nodal status and site identify patients at risk for early systemic failure.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 16-year period (1966 to 1981), 349 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy for pathologic stage B adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Nuclear DNA content was measured by flow cytometry on available archival material of 283 patients. Two hundred sixty-one patients (92%) had high-quality histograms. The ploidy distribution was as follows: DNA diploid, 177 (68%); DNA tetraploid, 74 (28%); and DNA aneuploid, 10 (4%). The average follow-up was 9.4 years. At the time of follow-up, 53 patients (20%) within the study group had developed tumor progression: 22 local, 23 systemic, and 8 both. The ploidy distribution of the population that developed tumor progression was 27 DNA diploid (51%), 16 DNA tetraploid (30%), and 10 DNA aneuploid (19%). This ploidy distribution is significantly different from that found for the nonprogression group with stage B disease. Overall, 31% of patients with DNA nondiploid tumors had tumors that progressed compared with 15% of patients with DNA diploid tumors. All (100%) DNA aneuploid tumors progressed. The DNA ploidy distribution of all pathologic stage B prostate cancers differs significantly from that found in more advanced stages (C and D1) previously reported for the same time interval. However, the ploidy distribution of stage B tumors that progressed closely resembles that of the stage C and D1 tumors. These results further support the working hypothesis that nuclear DNA content has marked prognostic significance for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. It seems to us that analysis of ploidy by flow or static cytometry will become an essential tool for treating patients with localized prostate cancer.\r"

We used a novel inhibitor of sialic acid incorporation, KI-8110, to determine the effect of depletion of cell surface sialic acid on the metastatic behavior of three human colorectal cancer cell lines, in which hepatic seeding was related to tumor cell differentiation. Treatment of tumor cells with KI-8110 prior to intrasplenic injection prevented liver colonization. Total cellular sialic acid was reduced, as was that of the cell surface. Secreted forms of carcinoembryonic antigen also were depleted of sialic acid by this treatment. These data show that depletion of sialic acid from cell surface glycoconjugates reduces the incidence of hepatic metastases from human colorectal primary tumors and adds to the mounting evidence of the importance of sialic acid in determining the biological behavior of tumor cells.\r"

Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was recommended as optional rather than mandatory to 64 of these patients based on small (2.5 cm or less) primary tumor size, adequate resection margins, no lymphatic or vascular invasion within the segmental mastectomy specimen, and minimal associated in situ cancer. Fifty-one of these patients elected to forego postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. At 72 months median follow-up, relapse occurred in the ipsilateral breast in three patients who elected to forego postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (6% by Kaplan-Meier analysis). Retrospective pathologic review revealed that tumor grade may also be important in determining whether postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary following segmental mastectomy. These data suggest that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy may not be required in every patient treated by segmental mastectomy. Further studies to define which patients can be spared the inconvenience, expense, and potential morbidity of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy are warranted.\r"

There is still a great need for considerable technological development to enable the use of intraoperative hyperthermia to treat large, complexly shaped intra-abdominal tumors, and phase II and III trials of this combination treatment modality should be performed.\r"

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were unable to assess extension through the rectal wall. No significant difference was observed between computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in assessing extension to the perivesical fat, adjacent organs, pelvic side wall, or lymph nodes.

All patients were treated with early excision of the burn wound within 72 hours of injury and received standard post burn resuscitational and nutritional support. Admission height and weight plots were within normal distribution parameters. Yearly growth velocities were calculated for up to 3 years after the burn. Despite adequate nutritional support and maximal exercise and/or long-bone stresses, a profound growth arrest was noted during postburn year 1, which slowly resolved to near normal distribution by postburn year 3. This retrospective study demonstrates that severe thermal injury is associated with a growth delay in the pediatric population. The exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown.\r"

Control patients for the group with primary fibromyalgia were matched for age and sex, and limited to patients with disorders that could be confused with primary fibromyalgia. Control patients for the group with secondary-concomitant fibromyalgia were matched for age, sex, and concomitant rheumatic disorders. Widespread pain (axial plus upper and lower segment plus left- and right-sided pain) was found in 97.6% of all patients with fibromyalgia and in 69.1% of all control patients. The combination of widespread pain and mild or greater tenderness in greater than or equal to 11 of 18 tender point sites yielded a sensitivity of 88.4% and a specificity of 81.1%. Primary fibromyalgia patients and secondary-concomitant fibromyalgia patients did not differ statistically in any major study variable, and the criteria performed equally well in patients with and those without concomitant rheumatic conditions. The newly proposed criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia are 1) widespread pain in combination with 2) tenderness at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites. No exclusions are made for the presence of concomitant radiographic or laboratory abnormalities. At the diagnostic or classification level, the distinction between primary fibromyalgia and secondary-concomitant fibromyalgia (as defined in the text) is abandoned.\r"

In the present study, we obtained detailed information on oral contraceptive use in 135 young women with confirmed definite or classic RA of recent onset and in 378 controls with soft tissue rheumatism or osteoarthritis. All patients had at least 2 years of followup to confirm the consistency of the diagnosis. Oral contraceptive use at any time before disease onset was reported by 70% of the RA patients and 85% of the controls; the latter figure corresponded to general population data for The Netherlands. This yielded a relative risk for RA of 0.39 among those who had ever used oral contraceptives and 0.58 for those using oral contraceptives at the time of symptom onset. The preventive effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of RA was found to be independent of the dose, duration of use, or presence of HLA-DR4. The strongest protection was seen in women with a family history of RA and in women ages 31-40 at symptom onset. The conflicting results in the literature are discussed, and a possible biologic mechanism for this phenomenon is suggested.\r"

All 7 A1-positive systemic lupus erythematosus sera reacted with UP1, whereas 9 of the 27 A1-positive RA sera did not. In RA, anti-A1 activity was significantly associated with antikeratin antibodies (AKA); these antibodies were present in 23 of 27 A1-positive sera and 10 of 31 A1-negative sera (P less than 0.01). Immunoabsorption with recombinant protein A1 resulted in a significant reduction of AKA titers in 6 of 10 RA sera tested, suggesting that AKA from RA patients may cross-react with the C-terminal portion of the heterogeneous nuclear RNP protein A1.\r"

The presence of IgA-RF correlated with the degree of functional disability. In contrast, IgA-RF was not found in the sera of systemic-onset disease patients, regardless of the degree of dysfunction. IgA-RF was detected in only 1 patient with pauciarticular disease, despite the fact that several patients in this group had severe disease. The presence of IgA-RF in polyarticular JRA did not correlate with serum IgA levels, but did correlate with the presence and the level of serum IgM-RF. Thus, the presence of IgA-RF appears to be specific for polyarticular JRA, and shows a correlation with severe disease in this group.\r"

JRA is a chronic inflammatory childhood disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by arthritis and immunoregulatory abnormalities. T suppressor cell precursors (CD8+, CD28-) were purified from the peripheral blood of 24 JRA patients, using a combination of monoclonal antibodies. These cells were treated with histamine or concanavalin A, agents that are known to induce suppressor activity. They were also tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferative response of autologous T cells to phytohemagglutinin. In some experiments, the accumulation of intracellular cAMP following histamine treatment was also measured. Twelve of 13 patients with clinically active JRA showed abnormal histamine-inducible T suppressor cell function, characterized by the failure of CD8+, CD28- T cells to mediate any detectable suppression. The failure of these cells to accumulate intracellular cAMP after histamine treatment was observed in 5 of 5 patients tested who had active disease. In contrast, 11 of 11 patients with clinically inactive JRA, 5 of 5 patients with cystic fibrosis, and 9 of 9 pediatric control subjects had normal histamine- and concanavalin A-inducible T suppressor cell function, and a normal cAMP response to histamine. These results suggest that patients with clinically active JRA have a reversible defect in T suppressor cell function that is associated with a failure of T suppressor cell precursors to accumulate intracellular cAMP following their exposure to selected immune stimuli.\r"

To test this hypothesis, sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis by articular cartilage in culture was stimulated or inhibited while the effect on extracellular PPi was measured. When stimulated by 0.8 mM xyloside to increase 35SO4 incorporation (mean +/- SEM % of control 183 +/- 16, n = 5), PPi accumulation changed little (from 54 +/- 6 pmoles/mg to 63 +/- 8 pmoles/mg of cartilage wet weight). Inhibition of sulfation with monensin or diethylcarbamazine disproportionately lowered 35SO4 incorporation compared with PPi elaboration. Using 60 mM diethylcarbamazine, PPi production was preserved (105 +/- 8% mean +/- SEM) compared with control cultures, while sulfation was markedly inhibited (7 +/- 1%). This dissociation of sulfate incorporation and PPi secretion indicates that it is not likely that glycosaminoglycan sulfation is the source of the PPi that escapes from chondrocytes to participate in the formation of extracellular crystals.\r"

The animals were randomly assigned to 5 groups of 6 animals each; they received daily oral doses of 3, 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg CsA or placebo for 10 days. The parameters studied were (a) caliper measurements of hindpaw swelling, (b) radiometric densitometry of caudal vertebrae, (c) quantitative histomorphometry of radiographed vertebrae, and (d) glycosaminoglycan measurements in femoral condyles. A significant dose-dependent regression of articular swelling occurred in rats given 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg CsA, and this was concomitant with improvement in bone density. These results correlated with those of quantitative bone morphometry. Thus, trabecular volume was significantly reduced in AIA rats, but restoration to virtually normal values occurred with CsA doses between 5 and 15 mg/kg. The protective effect of CsA on articular damage was supported by the dose-dependent progressive improvement in total femoral condyle glycosaminoglycan content. The favorable effect of CsA on AIA is likely due to a blockade of T cell activation via an inhibition of production of lymphokines such as interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon. The consequent cessation of the immune reaction would lead to a reduction in the release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1, that are likely to be the mediators of the pathologic bone and cartilage breakdown that is characteristic of arthritic disease.\r"

Injection of mBSA on day 0 into nonsensitized mice caused a weak inflammatory response confined to the infrapatellar fat pads and involved infiltration by mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The response developed between days 4 and 7 and resolved by day 28. No erosion of cartilage or subchondral bone was seen. In contrast, mBSA-treated mice injected with recombinant human IL-1 beta subcutaneously in the ipsilateral footpad on days 0-3 developed a severe monarticular arthritis in the antigen-injected knee. Pannus developed, extending over the articular surfaces, and extensive erosion of cartilage and subchondral bone occurred. Multinucleated giant cells, together with fibrin-like material, were observed at sites of active bone erosion and debris, and large numbers of neutrophils were seen in the joint space. These pathologic features represent a new arthritis model in which IL-1 profoundly augments a weak inflammatory response and induces acute erosive joint destruction, supporting the hypothesis that IL-1 is an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of arthritis.\r"

Synovial biopsy showed large areas of plasma cell infiltration subjacent to the synovial lining. Ultrastructural study demonstrated tubuloreticular structures within endothelial cells, crystal-like inclusions in plasma cells, and virus-like particles located around synoviocyte fragments. Although immunologic and morphologic studies did not permit classification of these virus-like structures, the role of these possible virions in the pathogenesis of the observed synovitis remains to be determined. Surprisingly, the patient's chronic arthritis resolved with anti-retroviral treatment (azidothymidine: AZT).\r"

The internal consistency of the RAI was indicated by Cronbach's standardized alpha value (alpha = 0.70). Significant correlations were observed between RAI scores and the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire Activities of Daily Living difficulty (r = 0.34, P less than or equal to 0.001) and dissatisfaction (r = 0.32, P less than or equal to 0.001) scores, the 10-cm visual analog pain scale (r = 0.42, P less than or equal to 0.001), and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale raw total (r = 0.63, P less than or equal to 0.01). These findings support the external validity of the RAI in SLE. In addition, these data suggest that the learned helplessness construct might be relevant to the outcomes of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.\r"

Restraints were used in 35 (13%) of the general medical patients and in 49 (34%) of the rehabilitation patients. The restrained general medical patients had higher mortality and morbidity rates than their unrestrained counterparts. Restrained patients had a higher prevalence of a psychiatric diagnosis, and major tranquilizers were used more than in their unrestrained counterparts in both settings. The general medical patients tended to have more than one type of restraint at a time, whereas the rehabilitation patients were restrained for longer proportions of their hospital stay. Thirty-three percent of the restrained patients whom we were able to interview expressed negative perceptions about the presence of the physical restraints. Moreover, it was found that the presence of cognitive and physical impairments were highly predictive of restraint use in both populations.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis showed three clonal karyotypic abnormalities: trisomy 3 and two translocations [t(1;15), (X;1)]. The patient was seropositive for HIV and HTLV-I; HTLV-I and HIV-1 DNA sequences were detected in peripheral blood leukocytes by the polymerase chain reaction. The HTLV-I sequences were detected in a relatively high proportion of mononuclear cells (at least 1 in 30 cells), whereas HIV-1 sequences were detected in a smaller proportion of cells (at least 1 in 3000 cells). Clinical remission was achieved after chemotherapy. There was a decrease in the proportion of HTLV-I positive mononuclear cells (at least 1 in 1000 cells), whereas the proportion of HIV-1 positive cells was relatively unchanged (at least 1 in 1000 cells). Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma in the setting of HIV coinfection may become increasingly common because asymptomatic retroviral coinfections are frequent.\r"

  ".W": "The inherited retinal degeneration of the rd mouse results in the exclusive loss of one cell type, the photoreceptors. We took advantage of this visual-cell loss to devise a strategy for the isolation of photoreceptor-specific cDNAs based on the use of subtractive and differential hybridizations. The resulting pool of photoreceptor-specific cDNAs was screened for a candidate cDNA for the rd gene, and a putative rd cDNA that maps to mouse chromosome 5, the chromosome to which the rd gene has been assigned, was identified. On Northern blots the candidate rd cDNA hybridizes a 3.3-kilobase RNA species from 9- to 11-day-old developing normal retina and, much more faintly, a 3.6-kb RNA species from age-matched rd retina. The 0.3-kilobase difference in the size of the mRNAs hybridized suggests that a structural alteration in the gene corresponding to the candidate rd cDNA has occurred in the rd mouse. This was further supported by the detection of polymorphisms between rd/rd and +/+ mouse genomic DNA after digestion with restriction endonucleases and probing with the candidate rd cDNA. Expression of mRNAs hybridized by the candidate rd cDNA is detected in normal and diseased retinas at postnatal day 1 but the signal intensity is considerably lower in the rd retina. To our knowledge, this is the earliest molecular defect reported in the rd retina that is observed prior to any phenotypic signs of photoreceptor degeneration.\r"

The students were asked to state their selected specialty and to rank the importance that each of 25 influences, listed as questionnaire items, had had in making their choice of specialty. Factor analysis showed that particular items were significantly associated with particular factors. The first factor emphasized perceived lifestyle (items in this category gave importance to remuneration, personal time, and prestige); the second factor emphasized cerebral activities and a practice orientation; and the third factor stressed altruistic values and attitudes. The authors classified the selected specialties into three groups: those characterized as having a non-controllable lifestyle (NCL), those with a controllable lifestyle (CL), and surgery. (CL specialties were defined as those that allow the physician to control the number of hours devoted to practicing the specialty.) Data were analyzed using factor analysis, and analysis of variance, and the Scheffe method. Analysis indicated that the perceived lifestyle factor was most closely associated with the responses of those students choosing CL specialties. Furthermore, this factor received the highest total loading of the three factors from all the students, thus indicating the level of interest in lifestyle factors. Responses to items that defined the cerebral and practice factor were highest from the group of students choosing CL specialties and lowest from the group choosing NCL specialties. The NCL students scored highest in the altruism factor and the CL students scored the lowest. The surgery and NCL groups were similar in attitude patterns, and both were substantially different in attitude patterns from those of the CL groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These results showed that the sample differed significantly in Myers-Briggs personality type from both the general practitioners of the 1950s and the early family practice residents of the 1970s, who preferred to see the world in terms of the immediate facts of experience and to make decisions objectively. There were also significant differences between the civilian and military family practice residents, but not between the community-based and university-based residents. Implications regarding future practice styles, physicians' personal values, and manpower needs are discussed.\r"

Mean aortic pressures became progressively elevated in all rats infused with saline and the magnitude of the elevation was significantly larger in those fed high-salt diets instead of the regular chow. Added pressor effects of high-salt feeding were unaffected by pharmacologic vasopressin or angiotensin blockade thereby indicating that humoral mediation by either peptide was not involved. A general increase in cardiovascular reactivity also seemed unlikely since pressor responsiveness to injected norepinephrine did not differ between rat groups. Sympathetic hyperactivity was considered to be a logical explanation because enhancement by high-salt feeding was abolished following either ganglion blockade with pentolinium or chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine. These findings are compatible with the interpretation that high-salt feeding enhanced pressor responses to centrally-infused saline by increasing sympathetic vasomotor tone.\r"

  ".W": "High K diets prevent hypertensive endothelial injury and intimal thickening. Cholesterol esters often deposit during hypercholesterolemia. Would a high K diet influence cholesterol ester deposits? In a normal rat on a normal diet, no cholesterol esters are detected in the aorta. Stroke prone SHR rats were fed for 3 months a basic diet containing 4% cholesterol, 14% coconut oil and 7% NaCl. One group of 13 rats had normal (.5%) K in the diet. Another group of 10 rats ate high (2.1%) K. Mean intraarterial blood pressures averaged 165 mm Hg in the normal K group and 161 mm Hg in the high K group (P = NS). The serum cholesterol averaged 229 mg/dL in the normal K group and 214 in the high K group (P = NS). Total aortic cholesterol esters per rat involving 16 and 18 carbon chain fatty acids averaged 187 micrograms in normal K v 68 micrograms in high K, measured by gas chromatography. These were the main esters; other esters were negligible. Thus high K reduced cholesterol ester deposits by 64% (P less than .0003), even though blood pressure and cholesterol levels were quite similar in the two groups. Both high cholesterol and high BP injure endothelial cells and increase invasion of macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells into the intima and increase endothelial permeability to proteins. With high plasma cholesterol, these processes lead to atherosclerosis with cholesterol ester deposition. The high K diet, by protecting endothelial cells, can greatly decrease this cholesterol ester deposition. This effect could possible be useful for preventing atherosclerotic complications such as heart attacks in human hypertension.\r"

In SBH rats, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) increased significantly. In SBN rats, MAP remained stable and TPRI decreased. Cardiac output and heart rate were unchanged. Opposed changes in TPRI were mediated mainly by changes in vascular resistance of the skin, skeletal muscles and splanchnic organs. Both strains developed significant biventricular hypertrophy. We conclude that SBH and SBN rats' susceptibility or resistance to DOCA-salt hypertension are associated with opposed changes in TPRI. The development of biventricular hypertrophy is apparently dissociated from systemic hemodynamic changes.\r"

These data demonstrated that a single 24 h average diastolic blood pressure by automatic noninvasive ambulatory monitoring was a significantly better predictor of echocardiographic posterior wall thickness, combined wall thickness or relative wall thickness than the multiple office or single office average diastolic blood pressure. Also there were highly significant correlations between both 24 h average systolic and diastolic blood pressure and these echocardiographic parameters (in descending order of correlation coefficient): combined wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, combined wall thickness/left ventricular diastolic diameter, left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass. Left ventricular end diastolic dimension did not linearly correlate with any systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement. Left atrial dimension demonstrated only a significant association with 24 h average diastolic blood pressure.

  ".W": "In the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, clonidine binds not only to alpha 2-adrenergic receptors but also to a novel class of nonadrenergic sites that are specific for imidazoles. Since clonidine has direct actions on the kidney, we sought to determine whether imidazole binding sites could be detected in renal cell membranes. Adrenergic agents having an imidazole ring, like clonidine, completely displaced the specific binding of the high-affinity clonidine analog 3H-p-aminoclonidine (3H-PAC) to kidney membranes. Nonimidazole adrenergic agents inhibited 3H-PAC binding by only 75%, indicating that the remaining 25% of the sites were nonadrenergic. Cimetidine, an imidazole compound lacking adrenergic potency, showed a high affinity for approximately 25% of the sites. 3H-PAC binding to imidazole sites was high-affinity (KD = 11 +/- 3 nmol/L) and saturable (Bmax = 41 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein). Like clonidine, an endogenous clonidine-displacing substance (CDS) completely inhibited 3H-PAC binding to renal cortex membranes. Quantitative receptor autoradiography revealed that imidazole receptors exhibited a specific regional distribution within the kidney that was unique, and distinct from that of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that clonidine binds to specific imidazole sites in the renal cortex of the rat and that CDS may be the endogenous ligand at these sites. Thus, in addition to their role in central nervous system control of arterial pressure, imidazole receptors may be involved in the regulation of renal function.\r"

The advent of intranasal endoscopes allowed for the development of a transnasal approach for medial and inferior orbital wall decompression. Using this approach, orbital decompressions were performed on 13 orbits in eight patients with severe complicated dysthyroid orbitopathy. Simultaneous bilateral lateral orbitotomies were performed on five patients. Walsh-Ogura decompressions and lateral orbitotomies were performed on two orbits. When combined with lateral orbitotomy, Hertel measurements improved an average of 5.7 mm in orbits decompressed transnasally and 4.5 mm in orbits decompressed with a Walsh-Ogura approach. Transnasal decompression alone improved Hertel measurements an average of 4.7 mm. Visual acuity improved in three of four patients with optic neuropathy, and in all patients with exposure keratopathy. We conclude that the endoscopic transnasal approach provides comparable decompression to traditional methods while avoiding the morbidity of an external ethmoidectomy or Caldwell-Luc antrotomy.\r"

Radiation doses ranged from 4000 to 7740 cGy (median, 5664 cGy). The 5-year determinate survival rates for patients given combined therapy with stage I and II disease vs patients given surgery only was 81.9% vs 95.8%, while for stages III and IV it was 51.2% vs 9.5%, respectively. Local control for stage III and IV disease in patients given combined therapy vs patients given surgery only at 5 years was 51.3% vs 16.8%. For patients with nodal metastases, 5-year determinate survival for the combined-therapy group vs the surgery-only group was 48.9% vs 18.7%, and the corresponding local-regional control was 69.1% vs 40.2%. The results of this analysis suggest that postoperative radiotherapy significantly improves outcome for patients with stage III and IV disease and for patients with lymph node metastases.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro, normal keratinocytes exhibit undifferentiated morphologic features and proliferate for multiple passages in low-calcium medium (less than or equal to 0.3 mmol/L) whereas, in high-calcium medium (greater than or equal to 1.0 mmol/L), these cells assume differentiation characteristics, begin to stratify, and eventually cease proliferating. In contrast, malignant keratinocytes grow well in high-calcium medium. Expression of pemphigus vulgaris antigen, a squamous cell marker, is altered on cultured normal keratinocytes by calcium. In this study we compared the effects of calcium levels on expression of cell surface antigens by UM-SCC-38, a human squamous carcinoma cell line, and normal keratinocytes cultured from newborn foreskin. Pemphigus, pemphigoid, beta 2-microglobulin antigens, as well as the epidermal growth factor receptor and the A9 germinal epithelial cell basement membrane squamous carcinoma antigen were examined. Pemphigus antigen was strongly expressed on normal and malignant cells in high-calcium but not low-calcium medium. Calcium concentration did not affect the expression of any of the other antigens tested. Thus, although calcium induces differentiation and eventual loss of proliferative capacity in normal but not malignant keratinocytes in vitro, we were unable to demonstrate differences in pemphigus vulgaris antigen expression that might be linked to the growth inhibitory effects induced by high calcium levels in nontransformed epithelial cells in culture.\r"

Those who recurred were compared with those who did not in regard to 16 prognostic variables, including whether or not they had received a perioperative blood transfusion. Analyzing each variable separately, five were significantly related to recurrence. These were (1) surgical margin status, (2) stage, (3) presence of pathologically positive nodes, (4) blood transfusion status, and (5) type of treatment. However, because several of these variables were clearly interrelated, the same data were subjected to a multivariate regression analysis specifically designed to identify significant prognostic variables independent of their association with other variables. By this analysis, only margin status and the presence or absence of a blood transfusion were statistically significant predictors of recurrence.\r"

Posturing of the head occurs with unilateral spasm of the sternocleidomastoid muscle such that the child will position the head with the occiput rotated to the affected side and the chin rotated to the contralateral side. We recently treated 26 children who presented to the emergency department with acute nontraumatic torticollis. The most common causes were upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, otomastoiditis, cervical adenitis, and retropharyngeal abscess or cellulitis. Four patients had subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint as a result of the inflammatory process. Children with acute torticollis need careful evaluation for either overt or occult otolaryngologic infections. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful in determining the cause of the acute torticollis and in ruling out rotatory subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint.\r"

Twenty-seven (68%) of 40 ears followed up for an average of 9.6 years (range, 2 to 24 years) had no deterioration of their immediate postoperative hearing gain. In the other ears, the decrease in hearing gain in the long term was due to progression of the sensorineural component of the hearing loss. Complete closure of the air-bone gap remained unchanged in 26 (70%) of 37 ears. In 5 (9%) of 58 ears the sensorineural component of the hearing loss increased as an immediate result of the operation. In 6 other ears (10%) progressive sensorineural hearing loss was seen only after more than 1 year. A natural course of the disease is assumed as the cause because progressive sensorineural hearing loss has also been seen in the nonoperated on contralateral ears of these patients.\r"

Usually, middle ear effusion appeared within 2 to 3 days and disappeared within 7 to 9 days after the inoculation of immunocomplex. Three days after the inoculation of immunocomplex, intranasal antigen challenge was performed three times daily and continued until the animals were killed. Disappearance of middle ear effusion appeared to be delayed in animals in which nasal allergic reactions were induced. Middle ear effusion was not found in those ears that were not inoculated with immunocomplex. Findings of the present study indicate that IgE-mediated allergic reactions of the mucous membrane lining the nose, nasopharynx, and eustachian tube constitute a factor indicative of a chronic state of disease, rather than a cause of otitis media with effusion.\r"

We hypothesized that persistent bacterial antigens in middle ear effusions (MEEs) might act as chronic inflammatory stimuli causing release of neutrophil proteins. Concentrations of neutrophil lactoferrin and a 37-kd cationic bactericidal protein (CAP 37) were measured in 47 MEEs collected from 27 children at the time of tympanostomy tube placement. Antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by latex particle agglutination and those of Haemophilus influenzae by dot-blot assay. Bacterial antigens were detectable in 24 (51%) of MEEs: S pneumoniae in 10 (21%), H influenzae in 12 (26%), and both antigens in 2 (4%). Concentrations of lactoferrin and CAP 37 in H influenzae antigen-positive MEEs were significantly higher than in either S pneumoniae antigen-positive or antigen-negative MEEs. We conclude that H influenzae antigen causes a greater middle-ear inflammatory response, as judged by neutrophil products, than does S pneumoniae antigen.\r"

Training for these seldom-performed procedures consists of temporal bone laboratory experience, close operative supervision, and the use of private patients for resident training. The majority (84%) of respondents did not feel that fellowship training was required to perform otologic surgery on graduation or that it should be required for obtaining hospital privileges in seldom-performed cases. Approximately three quarters (76%) of the program directors consider the training of seldom-performed procedures to be a moderate-to-serious problem facing otologic training today.\r"

The perception occurred only during exhalation, and appeared to be binasal. These findings, together with her morning mucus sample having a strong fishlike odor, prompted us to suspect a metabolic problem. Further testing at the Monell-Jefferson Chemosensory Clinical Research Center, Philadelphia, Pa, confirmed that she had trimethylaminuria. It is important to consider this and other treatable conditions when evaluating individuals with olfactory complaints.\r"

Because development of brain edema is a major and frequent complication during FHF, it was studied for this report. The degree of hepatocyte necrosis closely paralleled the severity of coma. Abnormalities in the orientation of hepatocellular organelles were evident as early as grade I hepatic coma, 24 hr after galactosamine-induced liver damage. Galactosamine caused a characteristic pattern of hepatocyte necrosis such that the endoplasmic reticulum completely surrounded the nucleus to cause karyolysis and subsequent cell death. Quantitative measurements of brain water content revealed evidence of brain edema with increasing severity of coma. Brain edema resulted in a greater than 4% swelling of the brain during this period. Light microscopy showed increasing cerebral and cerebellar edema during progressive stages of FHF. Electron microscopy studies revealed evidence of progressive cerebral edema, particularly in the perivascular region of cerebral capillaries. Marked swelling of perivascular astrocytes was evident as early as 24 hr after galactosamine-induced FHF when the animals were in Grade I hepatic coma. Abnormal swelling and distortion of astroglia, including its subcellular organelles, and the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, was clearly evident during the deeper stages of hepatic coma (Grades II-IV). Trypan blue dye infusion studies revealed evidence of extensive blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown beginning in Grade III coma.\r"

  ".W": "For circulatory assist devices and total artificial heart systems, impeller blood pumps with small total volumes would be fully implantable. One of the main obstacles, however, is generation of a pulsatile flow. The simplest way to overcome this problem is by changing the pump's revolutions per minute (rpm) periodically, but this often results in severe hemolysis. After theoretic analysis, two in vitro models of impeller blood pumps have been devised, producing pulsatile flow with constant rpm. In the first model, the impeller oscillates in an axial direction during constant rotation. The pump is driven by a DC motor (rotating) and a pneumatic device (oscillating). The form of the pulsatile pressure wave depends upon duration and amplitude of the oscillation. With 40% systolic duration and a 50 mm axial amplitude, a 70 mmHg pressure amplitude (170/100) is achieved with a semiphysiologic shape at a flow of 12 L/min. The second model produces a pulsatile flow by differing the gaps between impeller and cap on the inlet pipe. Both the cap and impeller have cone-shaped heads, and impeller oscillations of 1.5-2 mm, for example, results in a pressure pulse of 40 mmHg (150-110) at 7 L/min flow. Results of theoretic analyses have shown that both models create less turbulence in the impeller, with a consequent reduction in blood cell damage as compared to pumps with changing rpms.\r"

A subset of eight randomly chosen stable patients (four men and four women, mean age 42.3 years) had in vivo urea and creatinine dialyzer clearances measured before and after their hematocrits were increased by r-HuEPO treatment. The same dialyzer was used in both the pre-r-HuEPO and post-r-HuEPO studies. Dialyzer creatinine (Ccr) and urea (Ucr) clearances were measured at a blood flow of 300 ml/min 1 hour after the initiation of dialysis. The mean hematocrit of the group of 51 patients increased from 19% (range, 14-28%) to 33% (range, 21-27%). The mean hematocrit of the eight patients in whom the clearance studies were done was 19% before r-HuEPO and 35% after. Mean creatinine and urea clearances for the eight subjects at the lower hematocrit were 143 and 190 ml/min, respectively. After the increase in hematocrit, the mean creatinine and urea clearances were slightly lower at 132 and 166 ml/min, respectively. No patient had a rise in predialysis serum potassium, creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen. The authors concluded that the magnitude of changes in creatinine and urea clearances secondary to a r-HuEPO stimulated rise in hematocrit will be small and will not necessitate increases in dialysis time.\r"

  ".W": "The transonychial water loss (TOWL) was measured in 21 healthy volunteers with an evaporimeter, to establish the usefulness of this technique and study the influence of sex, age and nail-plate thickness. The median TOWL was 19.4 g/m2 h-1 and it decreased with increasing age (R = 0.51, P less than 0.018). The median transepidermal water loss (TEWLHAND) from the back of the hand was 16.0 g/m2 h-1 and from the dorsal side of the underarm (TEWLARM) it was 5.6 g/m2 h-1. The TEWLARM was significantly less than from any of the two other points studied (P less than 0.01), while there was no significant difference between the values obtained on the hand and the nail. TEWLARM had a median value of 6.4 g/m2 h-1 in men and 4.3 g/m2 h-1 in women (P less than 0.05) in this study. No significant correlation between nail-plate thickness, as measured by ultrasound 20 MHz A-scan, and TOWL was found. Measurements of TOWL are of interest and should be age-related. Further studies are needed to determine TOWL in various forms of nail pathology.\r"

To quantify the clinical severity of the syndrome, a new index of severity was used. Histometric evaluation of the cutaneous vasculature was performed on biopsies taken from the edge of the ulcers in the 31 patients and from the medical aspect of the lower legs in control subjects. Endothelial cell mass did not correlate with the clinical index of disease severity, suggesting that angiogenesis did not necessarily signal healing. The mean luminal volume appeared to be of greater prognostic value as there was a significant negative correlation of this parameter with the index of clinical severity. The degree of epidermal hyperplasia was found to be related to both the amount of inflammatory cell infiltrate present and the endothelial cell mass per unit tissue volume. The results also showed that the clinical index of disease severity was positively correlated to the mean epidermal thickness. The quantitative evaluation of biopsy material can be used to provide prognostic information in the gravitational syndrome.\r"

Human papillomavirus (HPV) 14, 20 and 21 were isolated from the plaques, HPV 3, 14 and 38 from flat warts and HPV 5, 12, 17, 20 and 38 from PV-like lesions. No clear relationship could be established between the different lesions and the types of HPV. Types 17 and 20 have been isolated most frequently from Japanese EV patients and HPV 5, frequently detected in other countries, is less common, whereas HPV 8 has not been isolated. Skin cancers occurred in six of the cases (50%) and all had benign lesions that were PV-like. At least one type of HPV 5, 17 or 20 could be isolated from these benign lesions and HPV 17 or 20 detected in the cancers. These three types of HPV in EV patients appear to be involved in the malignant transformation.\r"

We suggest that swabs should not be dipped repeatedly into the flask of liquid nitrogen but that, instead, a small aliquot of nitrogen should be decanted into a smaller 'clean' vessel and a new cotton swab used for each patient.\r"

Intelligence, visual-motor-perceptual skills, language, behaviour, social competence, temperament, physical growth, hearing, and middle-ear function were measured using standardized procedures. Health histories were obtained by maternal report. The results suggest that the wide range of developmental and behavioural variables studied is not influenced by removal of amniotic fluid in the mid-trimester. However, mothers who had amniocentesis were more likely to report a history of ear infections in their child (P = 0.04). In support of this finding were the results of audiological assessment which demonstrated a trend toward a higher rate of bilateral middle-ear impedance abnormalities in children whose mothers had amniocentesis (P = 0.06). Further study of the upper respiratory system is recommended to explore potential long-term sequelae of mid-trimester amniocentesis.\r"

Eight (4%) of the 219 patients developed abnormal cytology, but in six, smears reverted to normal spontaneously. Two patients had persistently abnormal smears and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) was diagnosed. Only one patient completing 15-year follow-up had an abnormal smear and VAIN later diagnosed. No patient over this 15-year period developed invasive vaginal carcinoma. Sixty vaginal carcinomas were identified during the period 1957-1987 from the gynaecology cancer register; only one was associated with a previous diagnosis of CIN 3 at hysterectomy. With such data we would propose screening 6-monthly during the first post-operative year and then at 2 years. If these smears were normal, the patient could then revert to the normal screening programme.\r"

Work inside and outside the home was ascertained through a questionnaire administered to each women before delivery. Odds ratios were adjusted for household income, maternal height and age, and birthweight of previous infant. Women with three or more children and no household help were at increased risk for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births compared with women with family (odds ratio (OR) 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31, 2.47) or hired help (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.33). Compared with office work, manual work increased the risk for an SGA (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56) and SGA/preterm birth (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.10 to 5.96). Work in a standing compared with sitting position significantly increased the risk for a preterm birth (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.60). There was a significant positive trend in frequency of SGA and SGA/preterm birth with an increase in the physical demands at work, as measured by an activity score. These data suggest that interventions to reduce physical exertion among pregnant women could improve birth outcome.\r"

Pre-eclamptic patients had significantly lower FT4 and higher TSH concentrations compared with values in third trimester normotensive pregnancies. There was a significantly higher frequency of lower TT4, TT3 and high TSH levels in the subgroup of pre-eclamptic patients who had low-birthweight babies. Thyroid hormone concentrations were not correlated with gestation at delivery or birthweight but, with the exception of FT4, were correlated with plasma albumin and urate concentrations. Plasma TSH correlated with birthweight and with plasma urate. The results suggest that mild biochemical hypothyroidism may be found in proteinuric pre-eclampsia, and the concentrations of TT4, TT3, FT3 and TSH may reflect the severity of pre-eclampsia.\r"

Lipoprotein levels were measured before oophorectomy and afterwards at 6 and 12 weeks, then at intervals of 3 months for 18 months. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels rose significantly (P less than 0.05) in the 6 weeks after operation from a mean of 3.57 (SD 0.66) mmol/l to 4.21 (SD 0.84) mmol/l with no significant changes thereafter. There were no significant changes in cholesterol in the other density fractions or in triglyceride levels. High density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions were measured in 10 of the women to assess any change in the relative amounts of cholesterol carried on HDL2 and HDL3, since the protective effect of HDL is believed to be conferred by the HDL2 fraction only. No significant change was found in either fraction. The increase in LDL cholesterol would be expected to result in an appreciable increase in the risk of developing coronary heart disease, but cannot wholly account for the increase in cardiovascular disease associated with oophorectomy.\r"
