  ".W": "We studied 12 children with pectus excavatum (mean age, 13.8 years) using pulmonary function and exercise testing. Eight patients had surgical repair and were studied before and after repair. Four patients did not have repair and were tested twice. The degree of chest wall deformity in the two groups was similar. All patients reached 86% or more of their maximal predicted heart rate with exercise. Total lung capacity decreased 8% (p less than 0.01) after operation. In the nonoperated control group, total lung capacity was similar during both studies. The ratio of ventilation at maximal exercise to maximal voluntary ventilation was 68% +/- 12% before and 66% +/- 9% after operation in the operated group and 69% +/- 18% and 79% +/- 30% at two studies in the nonoperated group (nonsignificant changes). Maximal oxygen uptake was 36.1 +/- 4.4 ml/kg/min preoperatively and 38.1 +/- 8.1 postoperatively and 41.2 +/- 7.3 ml/kg/min and 43.0 +/- 6.9 on two studies in the nonoperated group (nonsignificant changes). Cardiac output and stroke volume increased appropriately with exercise both before and after operation. Operation had no physiologically significant effect on the cardiorespiratory response to exercise. Slight changes in cardiorespiratory function occurred in both operated and nonoperated subjects. These results emphasize the importance of studying patients before and after operation and of using a control group.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of the presence of N2 disease in patients with non-small cell cancer of the lung is widely misunderstood. Long-term survival rates from 15% to more than 30% after surgical resection are frequently reported in the literature. However, these percentages represent only the surgical results in a highly selected and unfortunately small proportion of the entire number of patients with N2 disease. In those patients in whom N2 disease is readily clinically recognizable or is identified by standard roentgenographic or bronchoscopic study and proved by biopsy or is discovered by prethoracotomy mediastinal exploration, a 5-year survival rate of only approximately 2% for the entire group can be expected, even when aggressive surgical resection is performed when appropriate. In those patients in whom the N2 disease is only initially recognized at thoracotomy, the resectability rate is higher and 5-year survival rates as noted are in the range of 15% to 30%. Although surgical resection continues to be the primary choice of therapy in this small group (less than 20% of patients with N2 disease), surgical resection can be expected to salvage only 3% to 6% of all patients with N2 disease. Thus, with presently available therapy, the vast majority of patients proved to have N2 disease will die of their lung cancer. It must be concluded that N2 disease is a significant poor prognostic factor in patients with lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-two patients underwent 65 heart-lung transplant operations before April 1989. Thirty of these patients (operated on March 1981 to February 1986) were given cyclosporine and prednisone for immunosuppression. These 30 patients (group 1) are compared with the 32 most recent patients (group 2) treated with cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Patient characteristics (group 1 versus group 2) were similar including age (mean 32 versus 26 years) and indication for operation (51% versus 38%, primary pulmonary hypertension; 46% versus 45%, Eisenmenger complex; 3% versus 17%, other). The perioperative (in-hospital) mortality rate was 35% in group 1 versus 16% in group 2. Obliterative bronchiolitis developed in 12 (63%) of 19 hospital survivors in group 1 from 2 months to 49 months postoperatively (mean 12 months). This complication has developed in five (20%) of the 25 hospital survivors in group 2 from 3 to 13 months postoperatively (mean 8 months). Overall, 24 of the 30 patients in group 1 died (infection in eight, obliterative bronchiolitis in five, graft coronary artery disease in two, other causes in nine). Eight of the 32 patients in group 2 died (infection in six, other cases in two). Survival rates for group 1 patients were 60% at 1 year, 50% at 2 years, 43% at 3 years, and 25% at 5 years. Survival rates for group 2 patients were 73% at 1 year, 73% at 2 years, and 65% at 3 years (p less than 0.05). When group 2 patients were compared with 134 patients undergoing heart transplantation during the same time period, there was no difference in survival. Routine bronchoscopic surveillance in the more recent group of patients has led to the earlier detection of rejection and infection. In combination with decreased perioperative mortality and augmented immunosuppression, this had led to improved survival in our more recent heart-lung transplant recipients. In addition, the earlier recognition of infection and rejection has led to a decrease in severity of obliterative bronchiolitis.\r"

  ".U": "90097154\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported the occurrence of microembolic ischemia in the retina during cardiopulmonary bypass, as revealed by fluorescein angiography. This method has been extended by digital image analysis to include quantification of the extent of retinal ischemia and has been applied to a prospective comparative study of 64 patients undergoing elective coronary operations with either a bubble or a membrane oxygenator. Patients with diabetes or clinically evident cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Bypass procedures were standardized in all cases with pulsatile flow and a 40 microns arterial line filter (Pall EC Plus). Thirty patients had bypass with a bubble oxygenator (Harvey H1700) and 34 patients had bypass with a flat sheet membrane oxygenator (COBE CML). In each case retinal fluorescein angiograms were obtained preoperatively and 5 minutes before the end of bypass and were processed with a digital image analyzer (Context Vision GOP-302). Microembolic perfusion defects were identified by digital subtraction of preoperative and end-bypass angiograms and their total area was computed. Results. In the bubble oxygenator group retinal perfusion defects indicative of microembolism occurred in all 30 (100%) patients. In contrast, over half the patients in the membrane oxygenator group had normal retinal perfusion, and the prevalence of perfusion defects (44%; 70% confidence limits 34% to 54%) was significantly less than in the bubble group (p less than 0.001). In addition, those patients in the membrane group had significantly fewer lesions (median 0; 70% confidence limits 0 to 1) than patients in the bubble group (median 2; 70% confidence limits 2 to 2; p less than 0.001) and also had significantly smaller total areas of retinal ischemia (median 0 mm2; 70% confidence limits 0 to 0.16 mm2) than the bubble group (median 0.22 mm2; 70% confidence limits 0.21 to 0.27 mm2; p less than 0.001). There was no relationship between the extent of retinal ischemia and bypass time, arterial blood gas concentrations, volume of cardiotomy suction or donor blood returned to the pump, or recent medication with aspirin. Inferences. Digital image analysis of retinal fluorescein angiograms may provide a method of quantifying microembolic ischemia in the central nervous system during cardiopulmonary bypass. Flat sheet membrane oxygenation appears to provide significantly better protection against microembolic ischemia than bubble oxygenation.\r"

Variations in the density and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors were determined in vitro. Repeated determinations of plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were also performed. Overall, no significant modification was observed in mean density and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass when compared with control values. However, a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in affinity for isoproterenol was found in the six patients who had high catecholamine levels during cardiopulmonary bypass. In contrast, no significant modification of beta-adrenoreceptor affinity for isoproterenol was observed in the 10 patients who did not have this degree of adrenergic activation. In addition, beta-adrenoreceptor affinity for isoproterenol was decreased in the three patients in whom intraaortic balloon pumping was mandatory after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. We suggest that this decreased affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors could be related, at least in part, to a sustained adrenergic activation occurring in some patients during cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were treated with a combination of low-dose interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Patients received a continuous 24-hour intravenous infusion of interleukin-2 at 1 X 10(6) Cetus U/m2 and a simultaneous daily intramuscular dose of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (25 to 100 micrograms/m2) for 5 consecutive days. These doses did not have antitumor activity when administered alone in previous trials. Treatment was given at 3-week intervals. Common side effects included fever, local skin reaction at the injection site of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, pancytopenia, and general malaise, all of which were reversible within 48 hours of cessation of therapy. The maximum tolerated doses with this combination were 1 X 10(6) U/m2/day of interleukin-2 and 50 micrograms/m2/day of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, with thrombocytopenia (less than 50K) being the dose-limiting toxicity. Twelve patients received two cycles or more and were evaluable for response. Measurable tumor regression occurred in four patients. An additional seven patients had radiographic stabilization of disease (median = 12 weeks) before progression. All patients had augmented lymphokine-activated killer and natural killer activity during therapy. Enhanced lysis of autologous tumor in vitro was demonstrated in four of four patients during therapy. We conclude that combination immunotherapy with low-dose interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha can mediate tumor regression and can be given with acceptable toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied in two groups. Group A had standard cardiopulmonary bypass with nonpulsatile perfusion and group B had pulsatile perfusion. Measurements of plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, granulocyte elastase, and hemodynamic parameters including mean arterial pressure total peripheral resistance, cardiac index, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were made before and after anesthesia induction, after surgical incision, during cardiopulmonary bypass, and 2, 4, and 24 hours after the operation. The venous compliance of the total body venous bed was measured at the end of the operation. In all patients the total net fluid balance was determined during bypass and in the postoperative period. In both groups plasma catecholamine levels increased 5 minutes after institution of bypass (epinephrine 176 +/- 56 to 611 +/- 108 pg/ml and norepinephrine 231 +/- 48 to 518 +/- 100 pg/ml in group A; epinephrine 168 +/- 40 to 444 +/- 100 pg/ml and norepinephrine 162 +/- 44 to 267 +/- 52 pg/ml in group B). The maximum catecholamine level was measured between the end of bypass and 2 hours after the end of bypass (epinephrine 1489 +/- 169 pg/ml and norepinephrine 1542 +/- 108 pg/ml in group A; epinephrine 990 +/- 134 pg/ml and norepinephrine 934 +/- 197 pg/ml in group B). During the same period mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were also significantly higher in group A than in group B mean arterial pressure, 61.4 +/- 3 versus 53.6 +/- 3, p less than 0.06; total peripheral resistance, 1055 +/- 60 versus 899 +/- 45, p less than 0.01). The venous compliance was significantly higher in group A than in group B (2.4 +/- 0.3 versus 1.2 +/- 0.3 ml/mm Hg/kg body weight). The intraoperative and perioperative net fluid balance were significantly higher in group A than in group B (p less than 0.005). The average postoperative tracheal intubation time was also significantly longer in group A than in group B (4.6 +/- 1.2 hours versus 2.7 +/- 0.8 hours, p less than 0.001). No significant difference was detected in either hemoglobin or plasma free hemoglobin content between the two groups postoperatively. The results suggest that pulsatile perfusion, when compared with nonpulsatile perfusion, can attenuate the catecholamine stress response to cardiopulmonary bypass, reduce the fluid overloading of patients, and improve the postoperative recovery period as evaluated by tracheal intubation time.\r"

  ".U": "90097159\r", 
  ".W": "There is controversy whether the short-term and long-term results of coronary artery bypass grafting in elderly patients justify performing the procedure. Between January 1977 and December 1986, 4580 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, of whom 222 (4.9%) were 75 years old or older (mean 77 years). There were 143 men and 79 women and 139 (63%) were in New York Heart Association class IV. One hundred forty-six patients (66%) had had at least one preoperative myocardial infarction. Myocardial revascularization was performed under emergency conditions in 17 patients (18%). The mammary artery was used in 43%, 96% of the patients received two or more grafts. The mean number of bypass grafts was 3.1 per patient. The overall hospital mortality rate was 10.8% (24/222), 3.6% for elective procedures, 14.9% in urgent cases, and 35% in emergencies. In contrast, the overall early mortality rate was 3.1% in 4358 patients less than 75 years old. Complications occurred in 83 patients (37%). Of the patients discharged from the hospital, 198 were followed up for a mean of 48 months (1 to 130). Actuarial probability of survival was 75% at 48 months. Postoperatively 70% were in New York Heart Association class I or II and only 21% were rehospitalized for cardiac problems. During the follow-up period 77% of the patients were free from angina, and of those experiencing angina the mean time from operation to the first episode was 75 months. Although elderly patients have a somewhat increased operative mortality rate, particularly if operated on urgently or emergently, long-term survival and freedom from angina are excellent and justify continued performance of coronary bypass grafting in selected patients over 75 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to define the histologic and morphometric evolution that accompanies the increase in cholesterol content of vein bypass grafts in a nonhuman primate model. Cephalic vein grafts were interposed bilaterally in the femoral arteries of 15 stump-tailed macaque monkeys (Macaca arctoides), which were fed a diet that sustains plasma cholesterol levels of approximately 225 mg/dl. Grafts were excised from five animals for analysis on each of postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90. Cholesterol content increased from 69 +/- 24 micrograms/100 mg (mean +/- standard deviation) in ungrafted vein to 473 +/- 122 micrograms/100 mg in grafts 90 days after implantation (p less than 0.05). By stepwise regression analysis, cholesterol content was best predicted by abundance of foam cells (r2 = 0.82). Intima comprised 13% +/- 5% of the total cross-sectional area of the wall in ungrafted vein and 59% +/- 11% at day 90 (p less than 0.001). With cholesterol content excluded from the stepwise regression, intimal area was best predicted by the presence of foam cells (r2 = 0.39). There was consistently an increase in the prevalence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on the luminal surface and in both the intima and media during the first 14 days after grafting. Vasa vasorum, which were always present in ungrafted vein, were sparse at 3 days but reappeared by day 7. Medial fibrosis occurred in grafts, and in the 30- to 90-day interval it was directly correlated with the number of adventitial vasa vasorum present (r = 0.64, p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed prominent staining for both platelet factor VIII and fibronectin during the first month, with a gradual decline in staining intensity thereafter. The evolution of changes in vein bypass grafts documented in this report are in general agreement with graft changes observed in humans and support the validity of our model in evaluating the histologic correlates of increased graft cholesterol content.\r"

The overall adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between steroidal estrogen use and definite CHD (MI and SUD) was 0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 1.3). Smoking (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 2.3 to 11.6), hypertension (OR = 4.8; 95% CI = 2.3 to 10.2), and diabetes (OR = 8.4; 95% CI = 1.6 to 44.5) were strong risk factors for CHD events. If considered causal, cigarette smoking accounted for 64% of all MIs and SUDs in the community, hypertension accounted for 45%, and diabetes accounted for 13%. Although steroidal estrogen exposure reduced CHD among these women by 14%, giving steroidal estrogens to all women in this age group might reduce the population rates of MI by as much as 45%.\r"

These antibodies were not found in 43 control patients with other neurologic diseases, including myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuropathies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or in 9 patients with endocrine autoimmunity, but they were found in 2 of 21 control patients with SCC without a history of LES, 1 of whom had severe autonomic neuropathy. Seropositivity was more frequent in patients with LES who had evidence of a primary lung cancer (76%) than in those with other neoplasms or without evidence of cancer (30%). Antigens extracted from SCC tumor lines derived from patients with and without LES and from a human neuroblastoma line yielded results that were highly correlated. A control extract of colonic carcinoma (derived from a patient with LES) yielded negative results. The data implicate a tumor-associated VGCC as the autoimmunizing stimulus in a subset of patients with LES and provide the first direct evidence that the VGCC complex in SCC is a target for some LES antibodies. The serologic test described should be a useful aid in diagnosing LES.\r"

For patients with a diastolic pressure between 90 and 99 mm Hg on repeated measurements, treatment should be initiated if other risk factors are present--for example, a family history of coronary risk, increased cholesterol level, male sex, smoking, or diabetes mellitus. When the pressure seems to be labile or exaggerated in the office, home or ambulatory readings may provide confirmatory information. For persons with diastolic pressures in the range of 90 to 94 mm Hg, it may be suitable to initiate therapy with nonpharmacologic maneuvers such as sodium restriction, weight reduction, and physical conditioning. In such cases, careful follow-up of blood pressure is particularly important because it may increase later. The initial therapy for mild hypertension should be selected to minimize adverse effects and should be tailored to the individual patient. Management of all levels of hypertension must be considered in light of the associated risk factors and a concomitant effort to minimize cardiovascular risk.\r"

  ".W": "Laser angioplasty with the pulsed dye laser and integral ball-tipped optical fibres was used for primary treatment of occlusive femoropopliteal vascular disease in 26 limbs of 24 patients, all of whom warranted operative intervention. 19 had \"critical ischaemia\", 8 had pedal ulceration, and 4 had distal gangrene. The delivery device consisted of the laser fibre loaded retrogradely into a standard 6 mm balloon angioplasty catheter, and was introduced through a common femoral artery cutdown in an attempt to recanalise femoropopliteal occlusions of a mean length of 21 cm (range 3-49). Angiographic recanalisation was achieved with a mean energy of 250 J (range 38-727 J) in 23 of the 26 limbs; in each case the channel created by the laser fibre was augmented by balloon angioplasty. Technical failure occurred in 3 patients, due to wall dissection, persistent side-branch entry, and incomplete lesion penetration, respectively. Acute occlusion within 48 h occurred in 2 diabetic patients with very poor run-off and distal gangrene, and early failure occurred in another patient due to inadequate balloon dilatation. 1 patient with segmental tibial disease below a technically successful recanalisation did not show clinical improvement. Several patients had coexisting coronary artery disease, 3 of whom died of myocardial infarction--all with patent femoropopliteal vessels. In the 21 survivors, 14 vessels remained patent at a median of 7 months' follow-up.\r"

Bone mineral density of defined regions of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and carpus was measured in 25 men who met accepted diagnostic criteria for ankylosing spondylitis but had early disease, with normal mobility and no, or very minor, radiological evidence of lumbar spine involvement. Compared with age-matched male controls, patients with ankylosing spondylitis had a significantly lower hydroxyapatite density in the lumbar spine (mean [SD] 0.82 g/cm2 [0.12] vs 0.91 g/cm2 [0.11]) and in the femoral neck (0.83 g/cm2 [0.11] vs 0.92 g/cm2 [0.11]). There was no significant difference in carpal bone mineralisation density. The pattern of bone loss in these patients indicates early loss of trabecular bone in ankylosing spondylitis, possibly from a systemic cause, but biochemical indices of calcium turnover were similar in patients and controls.\r"

The results indicate that the length of time needed to read a passage was reduced in all four patients 2 weeks following surgery compared to the presurgical duration. In addition, the second formant of nine vowels studied was lower postsurgically. No changes in speaking fundamental frequency were found in three of the four patients; in the fourth, the speaking fundamental frequency was lower by approximately one semitone. Based on the reduced reading rates from the presurgical to the postsurgical conditions, changes in respiratory parameters in addition to vocal tract parameters warrant assessment when evaluating the speech of individuals prior to and following uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.\r"

The recent radiologic development of the detachable balloon catheter has permitted occlusion of the internal carotid artery in a controlled setting prior to any surgical procedure. An obvious prerequisite to using this technique is the demonstration of adequate collateral blood flow to the brain. Patients are evaluated with arteriography and temporary arterial balloon occlusion while monitoring physical signs and electroencephalography (EEG). Although usually performed preoperatively, internal carotid artery occlusion is needed intraoperatively on occasion. This essential adjuvant technique for the skull-base surgeon will be detailed along with its indications and limitations in 24 patients.\r"

Saccade latencies, on the other hand, are a function of the anatomic and physiologic components of the reflex. By producing an audible click simultaneously with the movement of a visual target used to stimulate a saccadic eye movement, the saccade latency is significantly shortened. This does not appear to be due to alerting. It is probably due to an auditory input to the superior colliculus which decreased threshold for initiating a saccadic eye movement. Twenty normal participants were tested with or without the click stimulus. Latencies were significantly shorter when the click stimulus was presented simultaneously with the eye movement. The anatomic pathways in this reflex are reviewed in the presentation. This study provides further information on sensory interaction in saccade reflexes and emphasizes the need to control stimulus conditions during saccade testing.\r"

  ".W": "During a 6-year period (June 1982 to June 1988), 100 consecutive total thyroidectomies were performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, for benign and malignant disease. There were five permanent complications: one deliberate sacrifice of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and four cases of persistent hypoparathyroidism. Four of these five complications occurred in extracapsular carcinoma and resulted from oncologic wide-field resection and/or deliberate sacrifice. One patient with benign disease suffered initially transient hypoparathyroidism which has now become permanent. Interestingly, two patients actually underwent deliberate sacrifice of a recurrent laryngeal nerve; one patient has made a surprising recovery at 16 months postoperative and now has full vocal cord mobility. Our experience suggests that the morbidity of total thyroidectomy relates primarily to the stage of malignancy and extracapsular extension, necessitating en bloc excision accompanied by additional lymph node dissection. The low incidence of permanent complications in benign thyroid disease suggests the feasibility of total thyroidectomy as the operation of choice when surgeons are familiar with the technique and indications.\r"

  ".W": "It has long been known that abnormally large vestibular aqueducts may accompany congenital malformations of the cochlea and semicircular canals. Recently, enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts as the sole radiographically detectable inner ear anomaly has been recognized as a distinct pattern of congenital inner ear malformation. Pathogenesis of the large vestibular aqueduct syndrome probably stems from an early derangement in the embryogenesis of the endolymphatic duct. This anomaly appears to be relatively common in children with sensorineural hearing loss and is probably significantly underdiagnosed. Hearing loss is typically bilateral and progressive, with stepwise rather than fluctuant hearing decrements often triggered by relatively minor head trauma. A review of 17 patients (33 ears) revealed an average hearing level at presentation of 57 dB with a speech discrimination score of 66%. Considerable variability exists in hearing level among affected ears, ranging from normal hearing (4%) to profound deafness (39%). In 12 patients (23 ears) with an average long-term follow-up of 7.3 years, the hearing loss progressed by an average of 25 dB, with a drop of 29% in speech discrimination over the period of observation. An endolymphatic to subarachnoid shunt was performed on seven ears in an effort to stabilize hearing. Four of these ears had a substantial immediate postoperative drop in hearing. For this reason, endolymphatic sac surgery is not recommended for patients with this deformity.\r"

Embolization did not affect length of hospitalization or reduce the incidence of new postoperative cranial nerve deficits. The surgeon's experience also plays a central role in reducing operative blood loss and operative time.

Melanoma of the mucous membrane is a rare condition and the most serious of all head and neck melanomas. Its highest incidence is in the oral cavity, followed by the nasal and pharyngeal cavities. It usually occurs during the fifth decade of life. In its early stages it is asymptomatic and often located in areas difficult to see upon visual examination and technically inaccessible. These facts lead to a delay in diagnosis, which reduces curability to 8%. In spite of these negative factors, there has been a significant improvement in the extension and quality of life for patients with melanoma of the mucous membrane. The biological characteristics of this disease are analyzed and a philosophy of management is offered.\r"

In this study, fresh tumor cells were enzymatically dissociated, enriched by adherence to plastic, and used in a 3-hour chromium-51 cytotoxicity assay. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were incubated for 3 days with or without added IL-2. IL-2-activated PBLs showed significant cytotoxicity against autologous and allogeneic targets, while only low levels of tumor lysis occurred with unstimulated PBLs. These findings suggest the possible use of IL-2-activated lymphocytes in the adoptive immunotherapy of HNSCC patients.\r"

The morbidity and mortality rates continued to be high and the survival rates low, but they were an improvement over those of other treatment plans. Since then, refinements of the ablative techniques and major advances in the reconstructive techniques have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality rates. The most recent data indicate a 45% survival rate at 42 months. It is evident that early diagnosis and staging of stomal recurrences will yield successful results. Because the mediastinal dissection operation is now safe, it should be applied more liberally in head and neck oncology situations such as subglottic extension of laryngeal cancer, advanced thyroid cancers, cervical esophageal and tracheal cancers, and all head and neck tumors with low-nodal disease.\r"

Three hundred fifty (42.1%) of these multiple cancers were considered synchronous, while 480 (57.9%) were classified as metachronous. Fifty percent of the metachronous cancers occurred within 31 months after the first primary; the mean time between the first primary and the second primary was 45 months. Approximately 22% of second primaries were found more than 5 years after the initial tumor. Five-year survival rates were higher in metachronous cancers (55%) than in synchronous cancers (18%). Survival rates varied according to the treatment. In 49.4% of synchronous tumors the treatment had to be modified because of the presence of two cancers. In these patients, 5-year survival rates were as low as 8%. In synchronous cancers that required no modification of the treatment, the prognosis was better and the survival rate was 28%. The preferential anatomical location of the second synchronous and metachronous cancers is discussed for first primaries situated in the oral cavity (103 cases), the oropharynx (120 cases), the hypopharynx (92 cases), and the larynx (87 cases). Second primaries in the esophagus were mostly synchronous cancers while, in the lung, second cancers were more frequently metachronous tumors.\r"

The goblet cell density was highest in hyperplastic pseudostratified epithelium, whereas it was four times lower in transitional epithelium and even lower in squamous epithelium.

Recent studies have shown that the polyvalent protease inhibitor, Miraclid, derived from human urine, is useful for treating DIC and acute pancreatitis. In view of this information, local administration of Miraclid was expected to diminish acute inflammation of the respiratory tract by creating a favorable balance in the protease-antiprotease system. Before the chemotherapeutic use of locally administered Miraclid, the inhibitory activity of Miraclid on various proteases was first estimated in vitro. Administration of Miraclid by means of ultrasonic nebulization was then investigated in rats. The results can be summarized as follows. 1. During ultrasonic nebulization, the inhibitory activity of Miraclid on protease was decreased by means of mechanical stimulation in comparison to the activity before nebulization. 2. Compared to administration of physiological saline into the tracheobronchial lumen, administration of Miraclid by means of ultrasonic nebulization decreased the fibrinolytic activity in tracheobronchial secretions.\r"

The RLN adductor branch was then cut and anastomosed to a nerve graft whose end was carried contralaterally and sutured to the left RLN or to the left PCA muscle. The phrenic fibers regrowing along the RLN abductor branch reinnervated the right PCA muscle and restored the inspiratory abduction of the right vocal cord in all the animals. In five of the six cats, the fibers regenerated through the RLN adductor branch and the graft reached the left PCA muscle and also restored the inspiratory opening of the larynx on the left side. Histological nerve examination revealed a fairly symmetrical distribution of the regenerated phrenic axons to the right and left PCA muscles.\r"

In order to explore the possible immunologic consequences to the middle ear (ME) of such gut exposure, guinea pigs were fed antigen either before or after systemic sensitization. A ME immune response was then elicited by ME antigenic challenge. Feeding before systemic sensitization induced systemic tolerance and blunted both the ME immune response and immune-mediated OME. Feeding after systemic sensitization amplified ME immunity and increased immune-mediated OME. Gut immunization, therefore, provides a potent modulation of ME immune response. Depending upon its timing, pathogen swallowing could produce immune hyporesponsiveness, with lowered resistance to infection but reduced immune-mediated inflammation. Alternatively, swallowing could result in immune hyperresponsiveness, with increased resistance but also increased inflammation.\r"

Uniformity of the surface following laser ablation may play an important role in the rate of epithelial healing and amount and type of stromal scarring. To test the effect of radiant exposure (fluence) on surface smoothness, we ablated rabbit corneas with the 193 nm argon fluoride excimer laser at nine radiant exposures from 50 to 850 mJ/cm2. A total energy of 100 J/cm2 was used for each ablation at a frequency of 1 Hz. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated progressive improvement of surface smoothness with increasing radiant exposures. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated no consistent increase in thickness to the surface condensate (pseudomembrane) with increasing radiant exposure. Improvement in surface quality associated with increasing radiant exposures may result from a more uniform depth of ablation per pulse in the corneal lamellae that absorb laser wavelengths differently. Radiant exposures at levels where the depth of ablation is the same regardless of increasing energy densities achieve a more uniform surface because inhomogeneities in the beam and variation in energy from pulse to pulse do not affect the ablation rate.\r"

Our experimental results revealed that laser photocoagulation with wavelengths longer than 590 nm was effective in occluding the choriocapillaries under a thin subretinal hemorrhage. Complete occlusion of choriocapillaries was accomplished by red dye laser (630 nm) or krypton red laser. The choroidal lesion coagulated by 590 nm dye laser showed more extensive reaction than the other lesions at a posttreatment interval of 7 days. The red dye laser (630 nm) or krypton red laser is recommended for the treatment of neovascular maculopathy under thin subretinal hemorrhage because of less reaction and complete occlusion of the choroidal neovascularization.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to assess the characteristics of tissue photoemission obtained from normal and atherosclerotic segments of human postmortem femoral arteries by 308 nm excimer laser irradiation of 60 ns pulsewidth. Three ablative (20, 30, and 40 mJ/pulse) and three non-ablative (2.5, 5, and 10 mJ/pulse) energy fluences were employed. Both the activating laser pulses and the induced photoemission were guided simultaneously over one and the same 1,000 micron core optical fiber that was positioned in direct tissue contact perpendicular to the vascular surface. The spectral lineshape of normal arterial and noncalcified atherosclerotic structures was characterized by a broad-continuum, double-peak emission of relevant intensity between wavelengths of 360 and 500 nm, with the most prominent emission in the range of 400-415 (407 nm peak) and 430-445 nm (437 nm peak). Fibrous and lipid atherosclerotic lesions, however, exhibited a significantly reduced intensity at 437 nm compared to normal artery layers (P less than 0.001), expressed as a 407/437 nm ratio of 1.321 +/- 0.075 for fibrous and 1.392 +/- 0.104 for lipid lesions. Normal artery components presented with approximately equal intensity at both emission peaks (407/437 nm ratio: intima, 1.054 +/- 0.033; media, 1.024 +/- 0.019; adventitia, 0.976 +/- 0.021). Comparison of spectral lineshape obtained under various energy fluences within a group of noncalcified tissues disclosed no substantial difference using the 407/437 nm ratio (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, calcified lesions revealed high-intensity multiple-line (397, 442, 461, and 528 nm) emission spectra under ablative energy fluences, whereas a low-intensity broad-continuum, single-peak spectrum resulted from irradiation beyond the ablation threshold. Thus, these findings suggest fluorescence phenomena for broad-continuum spectra, and plasma emission for multiple-line spectra as an underlying photodynamic process. Regardless of the activating energy fluence, spectral analysis of 308 nm activated photoemission provides accurate information about the laser target under standardized in vitro conditions. It is demonstrated that direct contact ablation and simultaneous spectral imaging of the target tissue via the same optical fiber is feasible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It has been suggested that this technique be used as a guidance system for laser angiosurgery catheters; however, irradiation by 476-nm light can change the spectroscopic properties of arterial tissue. We present studies that establish intensity levels and exposure times at which alterations in tissue spectral properties are minimal. We also investigate the nature of spectral alterations following exposure of normal human aorta to high intensities of 476-nm laser light. Changes in laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) are characterized by two prominent features: the peak fluorescence intensity decreases permanently, and the fluorescence lineshape changes in a largely reversible way. We relate these changes to alterations in individual tissue chromophores: permanent changes in absolute fluorescence intensity are due to irreversible changes in tissue fluorophores, reversible changes in fluorescence lineshape are due alterations in tissue absorbers. A simple kinetic model is used to describe the decrease in absolute fluorescence intensity.\r"

The cartilage defects in one limb of each dog were exposed to 30 J of Nd:YAG laser energy. The dogs were euthanatized 1 week (n = 6), 1 month (n = 7), and 6 months (n = 7) after surgery. Plastic-embedded, undecalcified histologic sections of each cartilage defect were examined for evidence of cartilage healing. Special stains were used to determine the type of repair tissue present, and morphometric measurements of repair tissue were made. No effect of Nd:YAG laser therapy on cartilage healing was noted.\r"

Various tissues (canine myocardium, human aorta, liver, and spleen) were irradiated by argon-ion (continuous wave [CW] and pulse) and YAG (CW) lasers employing both naked fiber and a laser-heated metal tip. All showed the formation of primarily carbon-centered, not oxygenated, free radicals, together with some minor unidentified species. This implies that the backbones of amino acids, lipids, or other biological building blocks are cleaved during the irradiation or thermal treatment. Different tissues produce similar radicals but with different amounts when irradiated by argon-ion, YAG, and laser-heated metal tip sources. The amount of the free radicals formed depends on the laser power (within 5-15 W). Compared to the naked fiber, the laser-heated metal tip shows the generation of at least twice the amount of free radicals. The possible relationship of the free radical formation to tissue injury is briefly discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenoleukodystrophy, a sex-linked peroxisomal disorder that results in the impaired oxidation of long-chain saturated fatty acids and causes neurologic impairment, is a rare cause of Addison's disease in children. Adrenomyeloneuropathy is the name given to a biochemically identical but milder and more slowly progressive variant of adrenoleukodystrophy that affects young adults, in whom adrenal insufficiency may long precede nervous system dysfunction. The transmission of adrenomyeloneuropathy, like that of most cases of adrenoleukodystrophy, is sex-linked. Because of a preponderance of male patients among a group of patients with the onset of adrenal failure in childhood, we questioned whether this condition might be the initial manifestation of adrenomyeloneuropathy. We therefore measured the plasma concentrations of very-long-chain saturated fatty acids in eight patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, five had elevated plasma hexacosanoic acid concentrations (range, 2.42 to 6.43 mumol per liter; mean normal level [+/- SD], 0.83 +/- 0.45), confirming the presence of adrenomyeloneuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed clear evidence of brain involvement in all five patients. Reexploration of the family histories revealed additional missed cases. We conclude that the possibility of adrenomyeloneuropathy should be considered in any boy with Addison's disease.\r"

  ".W": "In ataxia-telangiectasia, B-cell and T-cell deficiencies are thought to be due to a defect of rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. T cells recognize antigens through two types of CD3-associated receptors: alpha/beta chains on mature cells and gamma/delta chains mostly on immature cells. We studied 10 patients with ataxia-telangiectasia and found that most had a relative increase of circulating T cells bearing gamma/delta receptors rather than alpha/beta receptors, as compared with normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Patients with other immune deficits, including eight with common variable immunodeficiency, one with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, two with hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome, and one with severe combined immunodeficiency, had normal ratios of gamma/delta-bearing to alpha/beta-bearing cells. A marked predominance of gamma/delta-bearing T cells was found in a patient with a primary T-cell defect. The relative increase in gamma/delta-bearing T cells in the patients with ataxia-telangiectasia was largely accounted for by cells that reacted with the monoclonal antibody BB3, an apparently distinct subset of T cells that selectively express the C gamma 1 gene product of the T-cell receptor. Although they had normal ratios of gamma/delta-bearing to alpha/beta-bearing T cells, the patients with common variable immunodeficiency had a significant increase (P = 0.01) in the number of T cells expressing C gamma 2 that reacted with the monoclonal antibody delta-TCS-1. We conclude that the increased ratio of gamma/delta-bearing to alpha/beta-bearing T cells in ataxia-telangiectasia may reflect both a recombinational defect that interferes with T-cell and B-cell gene rearrangements and an inability to repair damage to the DNA.\r"

The interferon-alpha gene cluster and the interferon-beta 1 gene have been localized to this chromosomal region. We have previously demonstrated deletions of these genes in several cell lines established in vitro from patients with lymphoblastic leukemia. We report here homozygous or hemizygous deletions of the interferon-alpha and interferon-beta 1 genes in samples of leukemia cells from patients with lymphoblastic leukemia. Of 62 patients examined, 18 (29 percent) had such deletions. Four patients (7 percent) had homozygous deletions of the interferon-alpha gene cluster; of these, one also had a homozygous deletion and three had hemizygous deletions of the interferon-beta 1 gene. Fourteen patients (23 percent) had hemizygous deletions of both the interferon-alpha gene cluster and the interferon-beta 1 gene. In 8 of the 18 patients with deletions, the deletions of interferon genes were submicroscopic; in the 11 other patients, chromosomal rearrangements of 9p, including translocations or deletions, were visible on light microscopy. These chromosomal and molecular deletions are likely to be related to the loss of a tumor-suppressor gene (or genes) located on 9p, which may be an interferon gene or an unrelated but closely linked gene.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the effects of low-level lead exposure persist, we reexamined 132 of 270 young adults who had initially been studied as primary school-children in 1975 through 1978. In the earlier study, neurobehavioral functioning was found to be inversely related to dentin lead levels. As compared with those we restudied, the other 138 subjects had had somewhat higher lead levels on earlier analysis, as well as significantly lower IQ scores and poorer teachers' ratings of classroom behavior. When the 132 subjects were reexamined in 1988, impairment in neurobehavioral function was still found to be related to the lead content of teeth shed at the ages of six and seven. The young people with dentin lead levels greater than 20 ppm had a markedly higher risk of dropping out of high school (adjusted odds ratio, 7.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 40.7) and of having a reading disability (odds ratio, 5.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 19.7) as compared with those with dentin lead levels less than 10 ppm. Higher lead levels in childhood were also significantly associated with lower class standing in high school, increased absenteeism, lower vocabulary and grammatical-reasoning scores, poorer hand-eye coordination, longer reaction times, and slower finger tapping. No significant associations were found with the results of 10 other tests of neurobehavioral functioning. Lead levels were inversely related to self-reports of minor delinquent activity. We conclude that exposure to lead in childhood is associated with deficits in central nervous system functioning that persist into young adulthood.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that supplementation of the diet with oat bran may lower serum cholesterol levels. However, it is not known whether oat-bran diets lower serum cholesterol levels by replacing fatty foods in the diet or by a direct effect of the dietary fiber contained in oat bran. To determine which is the case, we compared the effect of isocaloric supplements of high-fiber oat bran (87 g per day) and a low-fiber refined-wheat product on the serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 20 healthy subjects, 23 to 49 years old. After a one-week base-line period during which they consumed their usual diets, the subjects were given each type of supplement for six-week periods in a double-blind, crossover trial. Mean serum cholesterol levels (+/- SD) were not significantly different during the high-fiber and low-fiber periods: total cholesterol, 4.44 +/- 0.73 and 4.46 +/- 0.64 mmol per liter (172 +/- 28 and 172 +/- 25 mg per deciliter); low-density lipoprotein, 2.69 +/- 0.63 and 2.77 +/- 0.59 mmol per liter (104 +/- 24 and 107 +/- 23 mg per deciliter); and high-density lipoprotein, 1.40 +/- 0.39 and 1.32 +/- 0.39 mmol per liter (54.2 +/- 15.0 and 50.9 +/- 15.2 mg per deciliter), respectively. However, both types of supplements lowered the mean base-line serum cholesterol level, 4.80 +/- 0.80 mmol per liter (186 +/- 31 mg per deciliter), by 7 to 8 percent (95 percent confidence interval for high fiber, 11 to 4 percent, and for low fiber, 11 to 3 percent). The subjects ate less saturated fat and cholesterol and more polyunsaturated fat during both periods of supplementation than at base line. Those changes in dietary fats were sufficient to explain all of the reduction in serum cholesterol levels caused by the high-fiber and low-fiber diets. The average blood pressure was 112/68 mm Hg at base line and did not change during either dietary period. We conclude that oat bran has little cholesterol-lowering effect and that high-fiber and low-fiber dietary grain supplements reduce serum cholesterol levels about equally, probably because they replace dietary fats.\r"

  ".U": "90098032\r", 
  ".W": "In recent decades mortality rates have declined for both white and nonwhite Americans, but national averages obscure the extremely high mortality rates in many inner-city communities. Using data from the 1980 census and from death certificates in 1979, 1980, and 1981, we examined mortality rates in New York City's Central Harlem health district, where 96 percent of the inhabitants are black and 41 percent live below the poverty line. For Harlem, the age-adjusted rate of mortality from all causes was the highest in New York City, more than double that of U.S. whites and 50 percent higher than that of U.S. blacks. Almost all the excess mortality was among those less than 65 years old. With rates for the white population as the basis for comparison, the standardized (adjusted for age) mortality ratios (SMRs) for deaths under the age of 65 in Harlem were 2.91 for male residents and 2.70 for female residents. The highest ratios were for women 25 to 34 years old (SMR, 6.13) and men 35 to 44 years old (SMR, 5.98). The chief causes of this excess mortality were cardiovascular disease (23.5 percent of the excess deaths; SMR, 2.23), cirrhosis (17.9 percent; SMR, 10.5), homicide (14.9 percent; SMR, 14.2), and neoplasms (12.6 percent; SMR, 1.77). Survival analysis showed that black men in Harlem were less likely to reach the age of 65 than men in Bangladesh. Of the 353 health areas in New York, 54 (with a total population of 650,000) had mortality rates for persons under 65 years old that were at lest twice the expected rate. All but one of these areas of high mortality were predominantly black or Hispanic. We conclude that Harlem and probably other inner-city areas with largely black populations have extremely high mortality rates that justify special consideration analogous to that given to natural-disaster areas.\r"

The estimate of relative risk among current smokers as compared with women who had never smoked was 3.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 4.4). Among exsmokers overall, the corresponding estimate of relative risk was 1.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.7). Among exsmokers, the estimate of relative risk was significantly elevated among women who had stopped smoking less than two years previously (relative risk, 2.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 3.8). Most of the increase in the risk had dissipated among the women who had stopped smoking two to three years previously, and the estimate of relative risk among the women who had not smoked for three or more years was virtually indistinguishable from that among the women who had never smoked. The same pattern of decline was apparent regardless of the amount smoked, the duration of smoking, the age of the women, or the presence of other predisposing factors. These data suggest that in women, as in men, the increase in the risk of a first myocardial infarction among cigarette smokers declines soon after the cessation of smoking and is largely dissipated after two or three years.\r"

The more 5' the position of these genes in the complex, the later and more distal is their expression. Antero-posterior differences are also observed. A model is proposed that accounts for the establishment of these expression domains in relation to the existence of a morphogen released by the zone of polarizing activity. Comparison of these observations with the expression patterns of the genes of Hox complexes in the early embryo suggests that similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the positional signalling along the axes of both the embryonic trunk and the fetal limbs.\r"

NK cells are distinct from mature T lymphocytes, because they do not rearrange or productively transcribe T-cell receptor alpha-, beta-, gamma- or delta-chain genes and do not express the CD3 gamma- or delta-subunits. But recent studies indicate that NK cells do express CD3 zeta, co-associated with other membrane proteins. Here we report that CD16, the receptor for the Fc (constant) region of IgG, specifically associates with the CD3 zeta homodimer on the membrane of human NK cells, and that co-transfection with CD3 zeta complementary DNA permits expression of a transmembrane-linked CD16 complex on COS-7 cells. These findings indicate that CD3 zeta can co-associate with membrane receptors of diverse cell types and function as a common structure for signal transduction.\r"

  ".U": "90098081\r", 
  ".W": "Cell-surface proteins are associated with the lipid bilayer either as membrane-spanning molecules or as glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPtdIns)-linked proteins. Proteins destined for GPtdIns anchoring are synthesized as precursors with a hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is removed during the processing of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ref. 1). We have investigated the structural requirements for GPtdIns anchoring through the study of two closely related proteins which exhibit alternative membrane attachment. The IgG Fc receptor, Fc gamma RIII, is GPtdIns-linked on neurophils (III-1) whereas on natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages it is found as a transmembrane-anchored molecule (III-2), able to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. At the primary structural level, the III-1 gene differs from that encoding III-2 by only nine nucleotide substitutions, which result in six amino-acid differences, and the absence of 21 amino acids at the C terminus. We have analysed a series of III-1 and III-2 mutants in transient expression assays, and show that Ser 203 in the GPtdIns attachment domain is the dominant residue in determining whether the molecule can be GPtdIns-anchored. As in the case of its murine homologue, Fc gamma RII alpha, surface expression of the III-2 molecule is dependent on co-expression of a second subunit, the gamma chain of F epsilon RI. Our data also suggest that gamma chain can associate with the III-1 precursor, preventing GPtdIns attachment, favouring instead a transmembrane form.\r"

Here we report on a murine ultraviolet-induced fibrosarcoma cell line which has an unusual PKC subcellular distribution with 87% of the PKC activity associated with the membrane. We have cloned and sequenced the alpha-PKC complementary DNA from ultraviolet-induced-fibrosarcoma cells and from mouse Balb/c brain and found four point mutations in the fibrosarcoma PKC, of which three are in the highly conserved regulatory domain and one is in the conserved region of the catalytic domain. Expression of this mutant alpha-PKC gene in normal Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts results in a fibrosarcoma-like PKC membrane localization and in cell transformation, as judged by their formation of dense foci, anchorage-independent growth and ability to induce solid tumours when inoculated into nude mice. By contast, transfectants expressing the normal alpha-PKC cDNA do not display a morphology typical of malignant transformed cells and fail to induce tumours in vivo. These findings demonstrate that point mutations in the primary structure of PKC modulate enzyme function and are responsible for inducing oncogenicity.\r"

This is achieved not only by the travelling wave of the basilar membrane in the cochlear partition, but also by the active participation of nonlinear and vulnerable elements that enhance frequency selectivity. It has been shown that isolated mammalian outer hair cells respond with a change in length when subjected to sound stimulation at a fixed frequency. Here we investigate the motile behaviour of isolated cells when the stimulus frequency is varied between 200 and 10,000 Hz. By varying the frequency and the intensity of the tone, it is possible to obtain 'tuning curves' for the motile response. We demonstrate that the cell body of solitary hair cells, free from contact with the basilar membrane, shows a sharply tuned motile behaviour. We suggest that frequency selectivity in the organ of Corti is amplified by the tuned motility of the cell body of outer hair cells.\r"

  ".U": "90098088\r", 
  ".W": "The telomeric ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of simple repeating sequences in which one DNA strand contains short tracts of guanine residues alternating with short tracts of A/T-rich sequences. The guanine-rich strand is always oriented in a 5'-3' direction towards the end of the chromosome and is extended to produce a 3' overhang of about two repeating units in species where the telomeric terminus is known. This overhang has been implicated in the formation of several unusual intra-and intermolecular DNA structures, although none of these structures has been characterized fully. We now report that oligonucleotides encoding Tetrahymena telomeres dimerize to form stable complexes in solution. This salt-dependent dimerization is mediated entirely by the 3'-terminal telomeric overhang (TT-GGGGTTGGGG) and produces complexes in which the N7 position of every guanine in the overhangs is chemically inaccessible. We therefore propose that telomeric DNA dimerizes by hydrogen bonding between two intramolecular hairpin loops, to form antiparallel quadruplexes containing cyclic guanine base tetrads. These novel hairpin dimers may be important in telomere association and recombination and could also provide a general mechanism for pairing two double helices in other recombinational processes.\r"

This article summarizes the information presented.

Korea has 424 neurosurgeons for a population of 41.5 million, and Australasia has 92 neurosurgeons and 19 trainees for 17.5 million people. Various other demographic, institutional, organizational, and economic aspects of neurological health care and delivery, education, and quality control are described. While financing and availability of adequate neurosurgical care remains a major problem in India, it appears that reducing the number of neurosurgical trainees remains, as it is in North America, a major issue in Japan and, to a lesser extent, in Korea. This problem, as well as certification of the quality of training, is being managed effectively in Australasia.\r"

  ".W": "The reported results of treatment of intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) are difficult to interpret because of heterogeneous management strategies, small numbers of patients, and short periods of follow-up. In 1985 we published the early results of operative treatment of 29 patients with IMSCT and were cautiously optimistic that aggressive operative management would have a salutary effect on long-term outcome. In this report, the most recent clinical status of these 29 original patients is reviewed along with that of 22 additional ones, to assess the intermediate and long-term results of treatment of IMSCT in 51 patients who underwent microsurgical resection between 1981 and 1987. Of these 51 patients, 24 had ependymomas, 18 had astrocytomas, and the remainder had a variety of less common lesions. Thirty-seven patients survive and have been followed for periods up to 72 months (mean 38 months). The neurological conditions of 21 patients are improved or have stabilized following operation. The conditions of 16 patients are worse postoperatively: 11 from operation and 5 from progression of disease. Eight patients are neurologically intact, 7 walk independently but abnormally, 9 ambulate with the aid of a cane or walker, and the remaining 13 are not ambulatory. Twelve of 18 patients with astrocytomas and 2 of 24 patients with ependymomas have died after a mean survival of 10 months from operation. Patients with ependymomas who had gross total resection have fared the best, with no deaths or recurrences, but no relationship could be discerned between the extent of resection and outcome in patients with astrocytomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between June 1984 and April 1988, 41 patients with severe posttraumatic lesions of the cervical spine between the C2-C3 and the C7-T1 level seen consecutively were treated by an anterior cervical fusion and osteosynthetic stabilization according to Caspar. These patients were prospectively studied. Seven patients had a bilateral facet dislocation, 5 a unilateral facet dislocation, 9 an anterior subluxation, 9 an anterior compression fracture, 5 a hangman's fracture, and 6 a hyperextension injury at a lower cervical level. From a neurological point of view, there were 12 patients with an initial complete transverse lesion and 14 with an incomplete transverse lesion, and the remaining 15 patients did not have any deficit initially. Four patients died during the first 3 months after the operation. In 38 patients good anatomical position was obtained, generally by the intraoperative use of the vertebral distractor of Caspar. In all patients excellent immediate postoperative stability of the spine was obtained, although in 2 patients a second operation was necessary a few days after the first one. Postoperatively all patients were \"immobilized\" by a soft collar for 3 months. Four patients with an initial complete transverse lesion showed some neurological recovery in the postoperative period, and all patients with an incomplete transverse lesion improved. There were no postoperative neurological disturbances in the group of patients who were neurologically normal from the beginning. The mean postoperative hospitalization time was 13.6 days. These results were compared to the results from the literature, concerning other conservative and operative treatments for posttraumatic lesions of the cervical spine.\r"

The indications for surgery were neurological deficit in 32 patients and pain in 2; 14 patients received preoperative radiotherapy. Of the 21 patients who were nonambulant preoperatively, 67% walked again, 21% regained sphincter control, and 68% had less pain. The surgical mortality was 12%; wound infection and dehiscence occurred in 15%. These results indicate that a single-stage decompression and posterior stabilization may improve neurological function dramatically in patients with malignant cord compression. The operative morbidity and mortality is comparable to that of laminectomy.\r"

Of these 143 (61%) were able to be contacted by telephone and given a structured interview designed for the study. The average time elapsed at follow-up from referral for all patients was 22.5 months. Outcome was measured in the following terms: current levels of pain, percent decrease in pain, subsequent health care utilization, activities of daily living, and attitudes toward treatment. After completion of the interview, the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire were sent to the patients. The patients fell into five groupings: Group 1--participants in the UMCPRC program (n = 39); Group 2--those whose participation was not approved by insurance (n = 30); Group 3--those who declined participation (n = 46); Group 4--participants in other programs (n = 14); Group 5--dropouts (n = 14). The five groups were not meaningfully different with regard to prereferral demographics. Interestingly, Group 1 patients exhibited significantly greater prereferral pain and unemployment levels. Despite this, at follow-up significantly more Group 1 members were employed and they exhibited a greater percent decrease in pain as compared to the nonparticipant groups. Returned McGill and Oswestry Questionnaires mirrored these findings. Group 1 members also demonstrated significantly lower rates of subsequent health care utilization, i.e., physician visits, hospitalizations, and surgery than the nonparticipant groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These included 2 chordomas, 1 metastatic renal cell carcinoma, 2 schwannomas (1 malignant, 1 benign), 1 neurofibroma, 1 neurofibrosarcoma, 1 aneurysmal bone cyst, and an exceedingly rare meningioma. The sex of the patients was not significant. The age of the patients at diagnosis ranged from 13 to 68 years (mean, 47 years). Initial symptoms of low back and radiating leg pain were present in all but 1 patient. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 9 years (mean, 2.6 years). A delay in diagnosis of 2 years or more occurred in 6 of the 9 patients. Progressive perineal numbness and/or sphincter dysfunction were seen in 6 patients, and a palpable rectal mass was noted in 6 of 9 patients. The efficacy of various diagnostic tests is presented, as are the surgical options--needle biopsy and anterior and posterior approaches. Despite improved radiographic imaging techniques, these unusual tumors are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and may masquerade as discogenic radiculopathy. Late diagnosis contributes to the difficulty of surgical extirpation. Anterior and posterior surgical approaches involving general, orthopedic, and urological surgeons may be required.\r"

  ".W": "Segmental endothelial desquamation of the common carotid artery was produced in 30 rats using a balloon catheter technique which produces consistent proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cells from 5 to 20 days after injury. Immediately after endothelial injury, 15 animals were treated with periadventitial application of heparin contained in a continuous-release drug-delivery system using the polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PVA alone applied in a similar fashion to 15 control rats. Animals were killed at 5, 10 and 20 days, respectively, after surgery by intracardiac perfusion-fixation, and vessels were prepared for light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against actin. At all time periods, there was a significant reduction in intimal cross-sectional area in heparin/PVA-treated vessels compared to control vessels. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete absence of endothelial cells from the luminal surface in both control and treated arteries at all time periods without evidence of significant platelet aggregation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive actin in the proliferating myointimal cells. Femoral venous prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were unchanged in heparin/PVA-treated animals compared to controls at 1, 5, and 10 days. Continuous-release polymer drug delivery can be used to apply heparin selectively to the adventitial surface of vessels and effect changes in the vessel wall over periods of up to 3 weeks. By this means, smooth muscle proliferation and subsequent vessel narrowing after endothelial injury were inhibited without systemic anticoagulation. This technique may be applicable to both clinical and research applications related to the pathophysiology of arterial injury.\r"

One patient harbored a basilar trunk aneurysm, 1 an aneurysm of the proximal posterior cerebral artery, 3 an aneurysm of the superior cerebellar artery, and 10 an aneurysm at the basilar tip. The size of the aneurysms varied between 5 and 30 mm. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was the symptom exhibited in 12, mass effect the symptom in 2, and 1 patient was asymptomatic but had an angiogram because of amaurosis. There were 9 patients with multiple aneurysms, 5 of whom had aneurysms of the bilateral anterior circulation. Four patients underwent operation early. In 2 patients, the basilar artery was the sole or main blood supply of the whole brain. All patients except the one with the basilar trunk aneurysm were operated on via a transsylvian approach. All patients received 500 to 800 mg of phenytoin and 10 to 20 mg of dexamethasone shortly before and during surgery, and mannitol (0.8 g/kg) 15 minutes before the induction of hypotension or temporary clipping. Three patients showed slowing of electrical activity over the right hemisphere as a result of retraction of the internal carotid artery; with repositioning of the retractor, this disappeared within 10 minutes. Electrocortical silence was induced in 8 patients; this was in anticipation of prolonged moderate hypotension in 2, short deep hypotension in 2, temporary clipping of major vessels--including the basilar artery--in 2, and a combination of deep hypotension combined with temporary clipping in 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between 1982 and 1988, 126 patients with aneurysms of the distal basilar artery who had been treated by 2 surgeons were retrospectively analyzed to determine the causes of morbidity and mortality from this disease and its treatment. Ten patients (8%) died, and 14 patients (11%) suffered permanent neurological disability after treatment. The causes of failed management could be grouped into the following categories: 1) direct effects of hemorrhage; 2) errors in surgical timing; 3) conceptual errors; 4) technical errors; 5) morbidity from delayed cerebral ischemia; and 6) complications of hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy for symptomatic vasospasm; a small group of patients who died despite having received what we consider excellent management were grouped under a seventh category, \"bad luck.\" Frequently, patients who did poorly suffered from multiple complications, each of which contributed to their overall morbidity. It is our hope that increased awareness of these potential pitfalls and the further evolution of intravascular technique in selected cases will, in time, improve the outlook for patients suffering from these dangerous lesions.\r"

The compound is perhaps more well-known under its trade name, Stelazine, as a classic antipsychotic drug. The drug demonstrated no therapeutic relief of preexisting chronic cerebral vasospasm at any time during 2 days of systemic administration at any practical dose. At doses far in excess of the normally accepted therapeutic range in humans, a prophylactic regimen reduced the severity of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage by approximately 35% compared to untreated dogs.\r"

There was a statistically significant association between CSF fistula and infection. All 6 positive cultures in patients with CSF fistulas were gram-negative. Thirty-two patients died during the study, a mortality rate of 8.4%. The mortality rate from infection was 1.8%. Two hundred seventy-seven of 347 patients were followed for a mean of 22 +/- 17 months during which time 2 patients were readmitted with central nervous system infections, both due to CSF leakage.

The tumors and the involved bony structures were surgically removed in one or more operations using different operative approaches. Ten patients underwent postoperative radiation therapy, either at our institution or prior to their referral to us. Total removal was defined as the absence of identifiable tumor on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic obtained 3 months postoperatively, and was accomplished in 9 patients. The ability to achieve total removal was greatly increased in patients with tumors that had not previously been operated on. We believe that these tumors must be treated by aggressive surgical resection when initially diagnosed, and this can be accomplished with low morbidity. The follow-up period in our patients was too short to allow us to determine whether such total removals can result in a cure or in long-term control of these formidable tumors.\r"

One month after surgery, visual field defects recurred, and a tumor mass comparable to the preoperative state was found on computed tomographic scan. The tumor size gradually diminished during treatment with CV 205-502, a tricyclic benzoquinoline which stimulates mainly D2 receptors and is better tolerated than bromocriptine. The visual fields were completely normalized after 3 months of treatment with the drug, and surgical management of the tumor mass was no longer considered to be necessary. Thus, as in many similar cases, the hormonally silent pituitary tumor in this patient proved unresponsive to bromocriptine treatment. In contrast, the tumor was reduced by therapy with CV 205-502, a drug that is better tolerated and might permit a more intense stimulation of D2 receptors.\r"

A case is reported of closed head injury that resulted in a right superior oblique palsy in association with incoordination on the left side. Diagnostic imaging revealed a normal cranial computed tomographic scan and a left dorsal midbrain lesion on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The relevant anatomy is reviewed, as well as the action of the superior oblique muscle, its agonists and antagonists, and the clinical manifestations of superior oblique dysfunction. This case is one of the few we are aware of in which a relatively isolated trochlear nerve palsy is the result of a lesion that can be documented by diagnostic imaging, and the first in which the imaging modality is magnetic resonance imaging scan.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the lesion, which had a reticulated core of increased and decreased signal intensity. Vertebral angiography did not show any vascular supply of the process. The patient was operated upon in the lateral park bench position. The lesion, being located close to the exit zone of the trigeminal nerve, could be removed totally with incision of the brain stem and atraumatic vaporization of the tumor tissue with the CO2 laser. Despite the fact that the histopathological examination revealed a cavernous angioma the application of laser energy was judged to be extremely valuable for the surgical procedure. It was concluded that with proper selection of application mode and wattage the CO2 laser may be used for extirpation of vascularized lesions also especially when situated in or close to deep lying vital structures of the brain.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study 144 adult patients with chronic subdural hematomas were randomly divided into three treatment groups after burr-hole evacuation. The two commonly used procedures (external closed system drainage and aspiration and irrigation without any drainage) were compared to a modified technique: permanent subdural drain with subcutaneous reservoir. After the hematoma was washed out with saline solution, a silicon catheter with multiple perforations was introduced into the subdural cavity and connected to a Rickham reservoir, fixed in the frontoparietal burr hole. In patients who showed secondary deterioration or enlargement of the residual hematoma as proven by computed tomographic scan, the reservoir was punctured and the subdural fluid aspirated. The great advantage of this method is that it is practicable at the bedside as well as in the outpatient department, thus making it possible to reduce the number of additional operations. The incidence of symptomatic residual or recurrent hematoma was similar in all three groups. The reoperation rate was 4-fold greater in the groups treated with conventional therapy, when compared to the group with the implanted system. At the same time there was no indication that the implantation of the drain was less safe, as judged by the incidence of seizures and infections.\r"

  ".U": "90098261\r", 
  ".W": "There is increasing interest in staged corpus callosotomy for intractable generalized epilepsy. At the first procedure, a portion (usually the anterior two-thirds) of the corpus callosum is sectioned. If seizures persist, completion of callosotomy or alternative treatment approaches can be considered. It is obviously important to ascertain that the desired extent of callosotomy was in fact accomplished at the time of initial operation. Our experience and the published literature indicate that the surgeon's impression at operation can be erroneous. We describe a technique of determining extent of corpus callosotomy during the procedure. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in the midsagittal plane is used to select the desired extent of callosotomy. That point on the corpus callosum is characterized using simple planar geometry in relation to three anatomic landmarks in that same plane: the glabella, the inion, and the bregma (midline intersection of the coronal suture). The same point along the corpus callosum can then be located on a lateral skull x-ray using these same three anatomic landmarks. At surgery, an intraoperative lateral skull x-ray is obtained with a marking clip, thereby verifying the actual extent of callosotomy. We have verified the reliability of this scheme in 5 callosotomy procedures and have used this technique for intraoperative localization of midline and parasagittal targets in another 7 cases (3 tumors, 2 aneurysms, and 2 placements of interhemispheric subdural grids). In addition, we reviewed corpus callosum topography on 25 randomly selected MRI scans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two separate bone flaps were created: a free frontotemporal-sphenoidal (pterional) bone flap and en bloc removal of the superior and lateral orbital margins with attached zygomatic arch. Cranio-orbital reconstruction was performed using the inner table of the pterional bone flap. Complete tumor removal was achieved in 14 patients and near total removal in 5. There was no mortality and in those patients who did not require orbital exenteration excellent to good cosmetic results were achieved in all but one case. This approach affords a wide exposure of the orbit and anterior and middle skull base, so that large tumors of the orbit and tumors involving the orbital apex, sphenoid wing, and infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae can be removed.\r"

The effect on the ICP was dramatic, although short-lived. A second operation, combined with local infusion of streptokinase in the sagittal sinus, had a permanent effect as judged from the ICP measurements, radiological findings, and clinical improvement. The combination of direct operative removal of thrombotic material and local infusion of a thrombolytic agent (streptokinase) proved to be an effective treatment of severe dural sinus thrombosis in this patient.\r"

Mortality was influenced by the trajectory of the bullet, intent to commit suicide, and the neurological status immediately after injury. The age and sex of the child and the caliber of the bullet did not influence survival. Three-fourths of the deaths occurred within 24 hours of injury, suggesting these patients had a mortal wound from the onset. Eleven of the children were attempting suicide, 9 of whom died; 13 were playing with a gun, 5 of whom died; 2 were shot as innocent bystanders to crimes in progress; 1 was shot while involved in a criminal act; 1 was shot in a hunting accident; and in 2 who died within minutes of arrival, the circumstances of the shooting were not documented. Of the survivors, none was left vegetative after 6 months, 3 had severe disabilities, 9 were moderately disabled, and 2 had a good outcome. The mortality rate is strikingly similar to that of adults with similar injuries; however, the morbidity appears to be less. On the other hand, with simple preventative measures, virtually each injury would have been avoided.\r"

TBH was produced by extradural balloon inflation over a 4-hour period and documented by the appearance of the pupils as dilated or fixed at midposition. Intracranial pressure (ICP), brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were recorded before, during, and after TBH. Statistical significance from baseline values to TBH was found for diminution of the BAEP amplitude, rise of the ICP, and diminution of the SSEP amplitude. An ICP rise to twice the baseline value and a 25% decrease in Wave V amplitude was found 1 hour before TBH. Changes in BAEP and SSEP took several minutes after deflation to return to baseline values. Analysis of Wave V of the BAEP was as sensitive as ICP in warning of TBH. Discussion centers upon previous animal studies of brain herniation and ICP elevation, and findings reported in humans deteriorating as a result of intracranial mass lesions. BAEP and SSEP monitoring may be used as noninvasive tests for brain stem compression in the setting of primate TBH, and in the future may be used to guide the effectiveness of therapy.\r"

Existing methods using bone grafts, interlaminar wires, or acrylic eventually produce stability but require prolonged periods of immobility and have a high failure rate. The ideal method of fixation should provide for permanent correction of deformity and relief of symptoms, with immediate stabilization, at a single procedure. Posterior fixation of the occiput to a stable part of the cervical spine with a molded metal rectangle held in place by interlaminar wires was used to accomplish this. We report 20 patients treated consecutively who have undergone craniocervical fusion by this method using Luque/Hartshill rectangles. Fourteen patients had preexisting atlantoaxial instability and 6 had cord compression, but would become unstable after decompression. All operations were performed under general anesthesia; 9 patients (40%) were awake for intubation/positioning, and 7 patients had a simultaneous decompression. Sixteen patients made an uncomplicated recovery and became mobile 3 days postoperatively. Symptomatic and neurological improvement occurred in 70% of all patients. Neurological complications occurred in 4 patients (20%), reflecting the serious nature of the condition; 2 patients (10%) showed no change. Scrutiny of their presentations and operations failed to identify avoidable risk factors, except faulty wiring techniques. In all patients, permanent stabilization was achieved immediately, facilitating early mobilization with a real chance of improvement, which indicates that the method merits wider application.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) on axonal regeneration into autologous peripheral nerve (PN) grafts implanted to the spinal cord (SC) of rats was assessed by retrograde labeling of the parent soma of the regenerating axons with horseradish peroxidase. NGF was delivered at the graft site over periods of 15 and 30 days by using indwelling osmotic minipumps. In control rats, the minipumps were filled with saline. At 15 days after grafting in the NGF-treated rats, the mean number of SC as well as dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that regenerated their axons into the peripheral nerve grafts was increased 55.3 and 26.4 times, respectively, as compared to the control group values. At 30 days, SC and DRG neurons in the NGF-treated group were 10.9 and 3.1 times greater than in the control group. In the NGF-treated group, the regenerating SC neurons were located within a range of 7 to 13 mm from the graft site as compared to 1 to 7 mm in the control group. Finally, the analysis of the soma diameters of the regenerating neurons showed that NGF enhanced and maintained with time the regenerative response from small-sized DRG neurons. Therefore, NGF is thought to promote directly the regenerative potential of SC as well as DRG neurons and to exert an indirect glial cell-mediated effect at the SC-graft interface.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to utilize a well-established rat glioma to evaluate boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Boron-10 (10B) is a stable isotope which, when irradiated with thermal neutrons, produces a capture reaction yielding high linear energy transfer particles (10B + 1nth----[11B]----4He(alpha) + 7Li + 2.79 MeV). The F98 tumor is an anaplastic glioma of CD Fischer rat origin with an aggressive biological behavior similar to that of human glioblastoma multiforme. F98 cells were implanted intracerebrally into the caudate nuclei of Fischer rats. Seven to 12 days later the boron-10-enriched polyhedral borane, Na2B12H11SH, was administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight at varying time intervals ranging from 3 to 23.5 hours before neutron irradiation. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed blood 10B values ranging from 0.33 to 10.5 micrograms/ml depending upon the time after administration, a T1/2 of 6.2 hours, normal brain 10B concentrations of 0.5 microgram/g, and tumor values ranging from 1.1 to 12.8 micrograms/g. No therapeutic gain was seen if the capture agent was given at 3 or 6 hours before irradiation with 4 x 10(12) n/cm2 (10 MW-min; 429 cGy). A 13.5-hour preirradiation interval resulted in a mean survival of 37.8 days (P less than 0.01), compared to 30.5 days (P less than 0.03) for irradiated controls and 22.1 days for untreated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored during 113 operations for the clipping of 134 cerebral aneurysms. Changes in peak latency and amplitude of early cortical SEP as well as central conduction time were evaluated. In 58 cases surgical occlusion of arterial vessels or other events occurred, and in 17 of these cases such events were associated with SEP changes or loss. Arterial occlusions resulted from temporary clipping of a feeding blood vessel (22), accidental clipping of a vessel (12), and intentional permanent vessel occlusion (8). A total SEP loss was seen in 2 cases of accidental vessel occlusion and in 6 cases of temporary vessel clipping. Significant SEP changes were found in 6 patients with temporary clipping, and once each with retraction of the cerebellum, retraction of the middle cerebral artery, and after intentional permanent vessel occlusion. Response to these changes included reapplication of aneurysm clips, repositioning of retractors, or removal of temporary clips. Stable SEP signals during 13 cases allowed the surgeon to proceed with the surgical course. Despite the limitations of SEP monitoring in certain anatomical locations, it has been found to be helpful in the operative management of some cases such as multilobed aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery, giant aneurysms, trapping procedures, and procedures requiring temporary vessel occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients with 44 intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms (ICCAAns) were seen at one institution from 1976 through 1988. Fifteen patients had multiple intracranial aneurysms and 7 had bilateral ICCAAns. Age at diagnosis ranged from 15 to 80 (median 61). Thirty patients were women. Sixteen had a history of hypertension. In 34% of patients the ICCAAns were asymptomatic at diagnosis, 36% were associated with headache, and 57% had associated signs or symptoms of mass effect including sixth nerve paresis (43%), trigeminal pain or sensory loss (32%), third nerve paresis (20%), decreased vision or visual field cut (18%), fourth nerve paresis (16%), and Horner's syndrome (7%). In 4 patients the ICCAAns ruptured, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage in 3 and epistaxis in 1. Two patients with ICCAAns were seen with spontaneous thrombosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery leading to distal ischemic symptoms in 1. More than 90% of the ICCAAns were saccular. Thirty-four percent were small (less than 1 cm), 48% were large (1 to 2.5 cm), and 16% were giant (greater than 2.5 cm). The majority arose from the anterior genu of the intracavernous internal carotid artery, followed in frequency by the horizontal segment, and then the posterior genu. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography for diagnosing ICCAAns and is the screening procedure of choice. Angiography remains the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis and determining specific anatomic details necessary to plan therapy. Analyzing the radiographic anatomy of 44 ICCAAns. we conclude that theories attributing the origin of aneurysms to arterial bifurcations may be inadequate to explain the point of origin and direction of take off of up to one-fourth of ICCAAns.\r"

Regretfully, manufacturers are still not required to provide product information regarding clip strength, and when such information is supplied, there is no interbrand consistency to how it is obtained. This experiment compares the closing pressures of 5 commonly used brands of aneurysm clips: Yasargil, Sugita, Sundt-Kees, Vari-Angle McFadden, and Heifetz. Interclip comparison is also made of opening pressures, that is, the arterial pressure required to open an aneurysm clip. Findings show a distinct difference in closing forces among these brands of aneurysm clips. The study of opening forces indicates that the important factors determining clip release or displacement were the failure of the clip to cross the vessel completely and intrinsic characteristics of the vascular wall.\r"

We successfully managed 5 patients with acquired aqueductal stenoses with no significant morbidity by the use of an intracranial cerebrospinal fluid diversion, namely a third ventriculostomy. First advocated by Dandy, ventriculostomy was largely passed over in favor of extracranial procedures. With improved surgical techniques, however, ventriculostomy is now considered to be a viable alternative in selected cases. In a further 19 patients, we subsequently broadened our patient selection to include those with Arnold-Chiari malformations, congenital noncommunicating hydrocephalus, and tumors. Two thirds of these children remain without shunts and apart from 1 child developing hemiplegia postoperatively, there has been no significant morbidity. Although the best results have been seen in the late onset groups, even early onset, noncommunicating hydrocephalus has been successfully managed. Even in patients in whom third ventriculostomy has failed and who have subsequently required ventriculoperitoneal shunts, we anticipate that they will remain less dependent on shunts because their hydrocephalus is now communicating, which tends not to have such a rapid onset or extreme levels of raised intracranial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "For intracranial recording of partial seizures considered to originate from one of the temporal or frontal lobes, the team in the Utrecht Academic Hospital has used subdural, multicontact, flexible electrodes since 1972. These are introduced through bilateral, frontocentral trephine holes and are manipulated under fluoroscopy to cover most of the cerebral convexity. It became evident that in many patients, additional placements to record from intracerebral structures were indispensable. Therefore, using the same trephine holes, an additional 2 to 4 depth electrodes were stereotactically implanted in the mesial temporal and/or frontal structures, as appropriate. An extensive intra- and extracerebral spatial representation of the epileptogenic zone was thus obtained. We report here the methods for manufacturing and applying these electrodes and our clinical experience with 28 patients. The results obtained so far stress the value of combining subdural and depth electroencephalographic monitoring in the presurgical selection of patients suffering from medically refractory complex partial seizures. By miniaturizing the electrodes, extensive areas of the brain can be investigated without craniotomy or multiple burr holes.\r"

Men were not recognized as parents but as helpmates or breadwinners which interfered with validation of the reality of the pregnancy or child. They felt excluded from the childbearing experience by their mates, health care providers, and society. Fathers found themselves without models to assist them in taking on the role of active and involved parent. The findings of this study promote greater understanding of the male experience of expectant and new parenthood and may serve as a beginning for the development of interventions to support and promote paternal behavior.\r"

Of the 78 MPQ words that describe pain quality, only 19 were selected by more than 20% of the subjects.

A Self-Help Model was tested with 396 subjects with diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis or arthritis-related conditions. Self-Help Model variables include disease characteristics, background inputs, monitoring, severity of illness, dependency, uncertainty, enabling skill, self-help, and life quality. Severity of illness, disease characteristics, background inputs, and monitoring explained 24% of the variance in dependency and 40% of the variance in uncertainty. Monitoring was the strongest contributor to explanation of enabling skill; however, only a small amount of the variance in enabling skill was explained, adjusted R2 = .15. Enabling skill was the strongest predictor of self-help, beta = .42, minimizing the influence of uncertainty, beta = -.23 and dependency, beta = -.10, on self-help, R2 = .55. Self-help was strongly related to life quality, beta = .62. Self-help and uncertainty explained 49% of the variance in life quality. Results suggest a basis for interventions that reduce dependency and uncertainty and enhance enabling skill.\r"

Analysis of interview data provided by 25 Polish immigrants, who resided in the United States ranging from 4 months to 39 years, allowed the construction of a model describing migrants' psychological adaptation. Loss and disruption, novelty, occupational adjustment, language accommodation, and subordination were described as predominant aspects of migration and resettlement. Psychological adaptation required the dual task of resolving grief over losses and disruption involved with leaving Poland and of mastering resettlement conditions associated with novelty, occupation, language, and subordination. The model provides assessment parameters and direction for intervening with migrants who are distressed. The model may also be generalized to other types of life change as well.\r"

  ".U": "90098979\r", 
  ".W": "The intraosseous route of vascular access has been popularized recently for resuscitation of children. Intraosseous succinylcholine use has been anecdotally reported for airway management. This drug could be utilized for control of the airway in pediatric burns, status epilepticus, or combative head-injured patients. No series quantifying the efficacy of the intraosseous route has been reported for succinylcholine. To accomplish this goal, six sheep serving as their own controls were anesthetized with halothane and subsequently intubated. Succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) was given. The time to respiratory arrest and 100% loss of the forefoot twitch upon stimulation of the anterior tibial nerve were noted. Each animal was successively studied using the intravenous (IV), intraosseous (IO), and intramuscular (IM) routes of administration, with a minimum of seven days separating trials. The average time from administration to respiratory arrest in seconds was 30.8 +/- 7.3 (IV), 57.5 +/- 10.3 (IO), and 230 +/- 106 (IM). The average time from administration to 100% loss of forefoot twitch in seconds was 93.3 +/- 34.0 (IV), 100.8 +/- 24.2 (IO), and 291 +/- 109 (IM). All groups were statistically significantly different using the t-test for the difference of means, with a p value less than 0.0015. We conclude that the intraosseous route of administration of succinylcholine in this series of sheep is comparable to the intravenous route and superior to the intramuscular route.\r"

  ".W": "Local anesthetic infiltration of wounds causes pain which distresses children. A painless topical anesthetic solution containing tetracaine, adrenaline, and cocaine (TAC) may reduce this distress. We hypothesized that the use of TAC for anesthesia may reduce the utilization of sedation for laceration repair. We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric emergency department (PED) patients receiving parenteral meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (DPT) during the period after TAC became routinely available. For comparison, data from a recent retrospective study of DPT (preTAC) use in the same PED were used. There was a reduction in the percent of total PED patients receiving DPT, from 1.7% preTAC to 1.2% during the TAC period (P less than 0.05). During the TAC period, there were no significant changes in patient volume or case-mix indicators. Of the major indications for DPT, there was no significant change in the percent receiving DPT for fractures, abscesses, burns, foreign body removal, or head injuries. However, there was a significant reduction in the percent of patients with lacerations receiving DPT during the experimental period, from 12% to 7.6% (P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in laceration frequency (119/mo and 116/mo), length (2.7 and 2.7 cm), location (85% and 93% total for face and digits), or complexity (64% and 63%) for preTAC and TAC periods, respectively. We conclude that TAC used for local anesthesia may reduce the need for sedation in PED patients with lacerations that require suturing.\r"

Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis, with 63 children being assigned a GCS score of 15 at presentation. Seventy-one percent of patients were male, and motor vehicle accidents accounted for 56% of the injuries. Forty patients reported loss of consciousness (LOC) following the accident. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.69 +/- 0.94 days. GCS scores, history of LOC, vomiting, or seizures did not significantly influence length of hospitalization. None of the patients developed complications, and all were discharged in good condition. We conclude that a child with minor head injury, GCS score of 15, and a normal neurologic examination and cranial CT scan can be safely discharged to the care of a responsible adult and can be observed at home.\r"

Criteria were established for the suspicion of abuse/neglect. During a 12-month period, 431 patients were evaluated. Eighty-four (19.5%) were suspected of being abused or neglected. The frequency of suspected abuse/neglect in single-parent families was 22%, compared to 10% for married couples (P = 0.027). There was no significant difference in the rate of suspected abuse/neglect in patients seen fewer than or more than 24 hours after the injury occurred. Seventy-five children (17%) had more than two burn sites, with 24 (32%) appearing to be a result of abuse/neglect (P = 0.01). One hundred twenty-eight patients (30%) were admitted to the hospital, with 34% suspected of being abused/neglected, compared to 13% who were treated on an ambulatory basis (P = 0.00005). Fifty-eight (69%) of the suspected abused/neglected patients were diagnosed based on the history and/or physical examination. The medical records of 31% revealed previous abuse/neglect, ingestion, failure to thrive, or old burns. We conclude that abuse or neglect is a significant factor in pediatric burn patients and that the child's previous medical record must be reviewed. Other associated factors include a single parent family or the child with greater than two burn sites. The actual incidence of abuse/neglect could not be determined, owing to laws regarding confidentiality.\r"

Other clinical signs such as miosis, excessive salivation and tearing, sweaty, cold skin, and gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent, while fasciculations and bradycardia were quite uncommon on arrival. Only two patients presented with all typical signs of organophosphate poisoning as described in adults. Signs of carbamate poisoning were indistinguishable from those of organophosphate poisoning and included signs of myoneural and CNS cholinergic receptor involvement, in addition to parasympathetic muscarinic dysfunction. Atropine sulfate was found to have a clear beneficial CNS effect in addition to its known peripheral antimuscarinic effect. Our data suggest that the clinical presentation of carbamate and organophosphate poisoning in early childhood and its response to therapy are quite different from those of adults and older children.\r"

This study focused on interpersonal assaultive injury, excluding sexual assault, child abuse, and self-inflicted injuries. Relevant injuries made up three-quarters of all admitted intentional injuries and represented a total of 671 patients (4.5% of all hospital admissions). The intentionally injured were compared to the catchment area population and to the remaining admitted hospital population, by age, sex, and race. Medical records of intentionally injured adolescents (n = 133) were reviewed and compared to a sample of adolescent homicide victims regarding the circumstance of the event and the relationship of victim to assailant. Relevant findings are that: (1) in the area served by this hospital, male adolescents are at relatively high risk for nonfatal intentional injury; (2) among adolescents, the majority of these intentional injuries are the result of interpersonal conflicts between acquaintances, paralleling the etiology of homicide: (3) a prevalence of missing data in the medical records of older male adolescents is symptomatic of the lack of attention that has been paid to understanding and preventing intentional injury among adolescents. It is concluded that: (1) more area-specific and hospital-based studies of intentional injury are needed as a guide to such preventive efforts; and (2) medical personnel providing acute care to victims of intentional injury are an important resource for this research and prevention effort.\r"

The use of cDNA and genomic probes from the Xp22-pter region allowed us to identify 12 different deletion intervals and to confirm, and further refine, the chromosomal assignment of X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata and Kallmann syndrome genes. A putative pseudoautosomal gene affecting height and an X-linked non-specific mental retardation gene have been tentatively assigned to specific intervals.

Certain glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants lose virtually all their activity at this concentration of NADP+ but are reactivated by 200 microM NADP+. Such variants presumably have a defect in their NADP+-binding site. We analyzed the sequence of cDNA or genomic DNA from seven unrelated patients with hemolytic anemia due to the inheritance of variants that are reactivated by NADP+. Six patients had substitutions of one of three adjacent amino acids, and the seventh patient had another amino acid substitution 23 residues downstream. These amino acids are highly conserved, all being present in rat and all but one being found also in Drosophila. The anomalous electrophoretic behavior of some of the variants can be explained by their loss of ability to bind NADP+. We conclude that the region in which these mutations occur defines the binding domain for NADP+ and that binding NADP+ that has been designated as \"structural\" and as \"catalytic\" probably occurs at the same site.\r"

After 11-14 weeks in culture, the metachromatic mononuclear cells comprised a substantial portion of the cultured cells. These cells contained 1.8-2 micrograms of histamine per 10(6) cells and bore receptors for IgE. All of the cells contained tryptase in their granules. Electron microscopic analysis showed that these cells were mature human mast cells, clearly different from the basophilic granulocytes or eosinophils that arise in a variety of circumstances in cord blood cell cultures. Most of the cultured mast cells expressed some granules with regular crystalline arrays and contained both tryptase and chymase, and thus resembled human skin mast cells.\r"

This paper presents evidence that NGF is also active in modulation of B-cell-mediated immune responses. NGF receptors were immunoprecipitated from highly purified human B-cell populations, and to a lesser extent, from T-cell populations, by using a monoclonal antibody recognizing NGF receptors present on neural cells. NGF receptors were also detected in significant amounts in human spleen and lymph node tissue. In addition, NGF induced a dose-dependent increase in B-cell DNA synthesis as determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine. This B-cell growth-promoting activity was inhibited by a neutralizing anti-NGF monoclonal antibody. Immunoglobulin secretion, principally affecting IgM synthesis, was also modulated by NGF. The concentrations that affected B-cell proliferation are consistent with the presence of functional high-affinity NGF receptors. The results suggest that NGF, in addition to its neurotrophic function, also acts as an immunoregulatory cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "A class of high molecular weight iron chelators has been prepared by covalently attaching deferoxamine (DFO), by its amino group, to a variety of biocompatible polymers such as dextran and hydroxyethyl-starch. The iron-binding properties of DFO are virtually unchanged after the attachment procedure, but the toxicity and circulatory half-life are profoundly altered. Competitive iron-binding experiments indicate that the conjugates retain a high affinity for ferric iron. In addition, the derivatives inhibit iron-driven lipid peroxidation as effectively as the parent drug. However, the LD50 in mice (based on DFO equivalents) is approximately 4000 mg/kg for dextran-DFO as compared to 250 mg/kg for free DFO. Consistent with the greatly decreased LD50, intravenous administration of the conjugates in dogs at a dose of 100 mg/kg (body weight) does not cause the severe hypotension associated with intravenous administration of DFO. The plasma half-lives of these adducts are increased greater than 10-fold for dextran-DFO and hydroxyethyl-starch-DFO compared to the free drug. Finally, and most importantly, the conjugates are effective in mediating in vivo iron mobilization and excretion. Because recent evidence implicates iron as an important component of tissue injury in many disease states, these high molecular weight iron chelators may have potential for improved therapy, allowing higher sustained plasma concentrations of the active drug.\r"

Abnormal glucose concentrations in the ranges studied did not selectively influence cell replication, and the effects on chondrogenesis were not due to differences in overall protein synthesis or glucose utilization in the treatment groups. Core protein gene expression was more severely affected than accumulation of extracellular product, suggesting the existence of posttranscriptional compensatory mechanisms. The sensitivity to ambient glucose levels of both expression of the cartilage-specific chondroitin sulfate core protein gene and the accumulation of the corresponding extracellular matrix macromolecules during chondrogenesis suggest a molecular mechanism for the well-known adverse effect of maternal diabetes on embryonic skeletogenesis. The results further suggest that hypoglycemia resulting from stringent control of diabetes may also be deleterious to skeletal development.\r"

Here we report the sequence of a cDNA for the normal SCL transcript, as well as for an aberrant fusion transcript produced in the leukemic cells. Although different at their 3' untranslated regions, both cDNAs predict a protein with primary amino acid sequence homology to the previously described amphipathic helix-loop-helix DNA binding and dimerization motif of the Ly1-1, myc, MyoD, immunoglobulin enhancer binding, daughterless, and achaete-scute families of genes. For these cDNAs, at least two different 5' ends are predicted, both of which retain this putative DNA binding domain and predict proteins in the range of 20-30 kDa. SCL mRNA is observed in \"early\" hematopoietic tissues. Taken together, these studies lead to the speculation that SCL plays a role in differentiation and/or commitment events during hematopoiesis.\r"

Connexin 32 reactivity was found in oligodendrocytes and also in a few neurons, whereas reactivity to connexins 26 and 43 was localized to leptomeningeal cells, ependymal cells, and pineal gland. Immunoreactivity with antibodies to connexin 43 also occurred in astrocytes. Furthermore, during embryonic and postnatal maturation of brain tissues, gap junction proteins were differentially expressed. Connexins 43 and 26 predominated in the neuroepithelium of embryonic brains, whereas connexin 32 was virtually absent. Between 3 and 6 weeks after birth, connexin 26 largely disappeared from immature brain; this time course corresponded to the increased expression of connexin 32. Expression of connexin 43 remained high throughout embryonic and postnatal development. These findings demonstrate that gap junction expression in the brain is diverse, with specific cell types expressing different connexins; this cell-specific distribution may imply differences in the function of these intercellular channels in different loci and developmental stages.\r"

Of six antibodies tested, two recognizing amino acid residues 355-371 and 382-400 located on an extracellular loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 of domain I and one recognizing residues 1686-1703 of a similar loop of domain IV inhibit binding by 30-55%. Inhibition is concentration-(EC50 = 0.4-2 microM) and time- (t1/2 = 40-80 min) dependent. Five different monoclonal antibodies recognizing the same extracellular loop in domain I inhibit binding completely with similar EC50 values as observed for site-directed antibodies. Kinetic studies of the antibody effect are consistent with a slowly reversible competition for the toxin receptor site. Our results suggest that the extracellular loops between segments S5 and S6 of domains I and IV comprise at least part of the alpha-scorpion toxin receptor site and support the membrane topology models in which domains I and IV are adjacent in the tertiary structure of the channel protein and six transmembrane sequences are contained in each of the four homologous domains.\r"

We used fluorescence-digital imaging microscopy in combination with a halide-specific fluorescent dye [6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ)] to determine if this defective salt reabsorption is referable to a reduced plasma membrane Cl- permeability of the epithelial cells that line the sweat duct. Sweat duct cells were cultured from explants of normal and CF reabsorptive duct and loaded with SPQ, the fluorescence of which is specifically quenched by halide ions (Br- greater than Cl-) and provides a relative index of intracellular halide concentration. Two lines of evidence indicate that normal sweat duct cells exhibit a substantial permeability to Cl- and Br-. First, the replacement of extracellular Cl- with an impermeant anion (i.e., gluconate) resulted in a rapid and reversible increase in the intracellular fluorescence, as expected if the cells rapidly lost Cl- to the extracellular media. Second, the replacement of extracellular Cl- with Br- resulted in a rapid and reversible quenching of the intracellular fluorescence, as expected if the cells accumulated Br- (a more effective quencher of SPQ fluorescence) in exchange for Cl-. The rate of fluorescence change that was induced by either maneuver was inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (10 microM). Moreover, CF cells exhibited markedly reduced rates of fluorescence change in response to either maneuver. Our results document the utility of this imaging strategy for assessing the Cl- permeabilities of individual epithelial cells that are affected in cystic fibrosis and indicate that the defective salt reabsorption by the CF sweat duct is referable, at least in part, to a reduced plasma membrane Cl- permeability of sweat duct cells.\r"

One-hundred sixty-eight solvent molecules have been located, and isotropic temperature factors for each atom have been refined. The overall structure is composed of 12 beta-strands that can best be described as forming the four triangular faces of a tetrahedron with hydrogen bonding resembling normal antiparallel beta-sheets only at the vertices. The interior of this tetrahedron is filled by hydrophobic side chains. Analysis of sequence alignments with IL-1 beta from other mammalian species shows the interior to be very well conserved with the exterior residues markedly less so. There does not appear to be a clustering of invariant amino acid side chains on the surface of the molecule, suggesting an area of interaction with the IL-1 receptor. Comparison of the IL-1 beta structure with IL-1 alpha sequences indicates that IL-1 alpha probably has a similar overall folding as IL-1 beta but binds to the receptor in a different fashion. The three-dimensional structure of the IL-1 beta is analyzed in light of what has been suggested by previously published work on mutants and fragments of the molecule.\r"

  ".U": "90099326\r", 
  ".W": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important enzyme that helps govern cell metabolism and growth. The enzyme is physiologically activated when an (S)-diglyceride binds to its own regulatory domain. The saturable binding site of the regulatory domain can also be bound by any of a group of structurally diverse tumor promoters, including debromoaplysiatoxins (DATs), phorbol esters, ingenols, teleocidins, and bryostatins. The question of how the same binding site can be the target of these structurally diverse molecules is of considerable importance and is addressed in this article. The relatively rigid structure of DAT and the fact that it possesses a diglyceride moiety renders it an ideal starting template. Structure-activity studies with PKC reveal that the C29 but not the C30 stereocenter of DAT is critical for activity. Furthermore, 3-deoxy-DAT and DAT are equipotent as PKC activators, hence the C3 hydroxyl group of DAT is not critical for activity. Straightforward structural considerations show that the C30 hydroxyl group of DAT matches the C3 hydroxyl group of diglyceride, the C29 stereocenter of DAT matches the C2 stereocenter of (S)-diglyceride, and the C1 ester moiety of DAT matches the C2 ester moiety of diglyceride. Based on these studies and on published structure-activity observations on other tumor promoters, a structural hypothesis is developed to account for the chemical mechanism of tumor promoter action. Experimentally testable predictions are made concerning the interactions with PKC of several classes of tumor PKC activators.\r"

The DNA sequence analysis also revealed consensus mononucleotide binding domains in the deduced virB5 and virB11 gene products, suggesting that one or both of these proteins couple energy, by means of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis, to T-DNA transport. In this report, the product of virB11, an essential virulence gene, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified by using immunoaffinity chromatography. The immunoaffinity purified protein, as well as NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel-eluted protein, bound and hydrolyzed ATP in the absence of DNA effectors. VirB11 protein also demonstrated in vitro autophosphorylation activity. VirB11 protein was localized primarily to the cytoplasmic membrane by immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions. The deduced VirB11 protein exhibits sequence similarity to comG ORF1, a protein required for uptake of DNA by competent Bacillus subtilis cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation may serve to activate a component(s) of the A. tumefaciens T-DNA transport apparatus and may also represent a general activation mechanism of other bacterial DNA transport systems.\r"

This DNA fragment was subjected to treatment with the thymidine-specific reagent osmium tetroxide and to DNase I \"footprinting\" in the presence or absence of micromolar concentrations of echinomycin. We report that this anti-tumor antibiotic binds to DNA containing the nucleoside analog as well as to natural DNA and that the previously reported hypersensitivity to osmium tetroxide of certain thymidine residues adjacent to echinomycin binding sites is maintained in analog-containing DNA. Since these thymidines are rendered incapable of participating in Hoogsteen base pairs by the incorporation of 7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine, we conclude that this unusual base-pairing scheme is not the cause of the observed hypersensitivity to osmium tetroxide and that it therefore results from a large local unwinding of the DNA in the presence of the antibiotic. Moreover, preventing the possibility of Hoogsteen base pairing does not preclude echinomycin binding.\r"

We have exploited microprojectile-mediated gene transfer to develop a rapid transient expression assay system for the study of DNA sequences involved in the phytochrome-regulated expression of these genes. The 5'-flanking sequence and part of the structural region of an oat phy gene have been fused to a reporter coding sequence (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, CAT) and introduced into intact darkgrown seedlings by using high-velocity microprojectiles. Expression is assayable in less than 24 hr from bombardment. The introduced oat phy-CAT fusion gene is expressed and down-regulated by white light in barley, rice, and oat, whereas no expression is detected in three dicots tested, tobacco, cucumber, and Arabidopsis thaliana. In bombarded rice shoots, red/far-red light-reversible repression of expression of the heterologous oat phy-CAT gene shows that it is regulated by phytochrome in a manner parallel to that of the endogenous rice phy genes. These data indicate that the transduction pathway components and promoter sequences involved in autoregulation of phy expression have been evolutionarily conserved between oat and rice. The experiments show the feasibility of using high-velocity microprojectile-mediated gene transfer for the rapid analysis of light-controlled monocot gene promoters in monocot tissues that until now have been recalcitrant to such studies.\r"

This adduct was purified from human urine and characterized. The described assay employs a series of solid-phase extraction steps that separate 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine from other urinary constituents, followed by analysis by gradient reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a dual-electrode high-efficiency electrochemical detection system. Analysis of urine from three species by this method indicates that mice excrete approximately 3.3-fold more 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine than humans (582 vs. 178 residues per cell per day), a result that supports the proposal that oxidative damage to DNA increases in proportion to species-specific basal metabolic rates.\r"

Phenanthroline was covalently attached to the 5' end of an 11-mer homopyrimidine oligonucleotide of sequence d(TTTCCTCCTCT). Simian virus 40 DNA, which contains a single target site for this oligonucleotide, was used as a substrate for the phenanthroline-oligonucleotide conjugate. In the presence of copper ions and a reducing agent, a single specific double-strand cleavage site was observed at 20 degrees C by agarose gel electrophoresis. The efficiency of double-strand cleavage was greater than 70% at 20 degrees C and pH 7.4. Secondary cleavage sites were observed when binding of the oligonucleotide to mismatched sequences was allowed to take place at low temperature. The exact location of the cleavage sites was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of denatured fragments by using both simian virus 40 DNA and a synthetic DNA fragment containing the target sequence. The asymmetric distribution of the cleavage sites on the two strands revealed that the cleavage reaction took place in the minor groove even though the phenanthroline linker was located in the major groove. Linkers of different lengths were used to tether phenanthroline to the oligonucleotide and their relative efficacies of DNA cleavage were compared. Based on these comparative studies and on model building, it is proposed that the phenanthroline ring carried by the oligonucleotide intercalates from the major groove and that copper chelation locks the complex in place from within the minor groove where the cleavage reaction occurs.\r"

To better understand these interactions, we studied the effect of position on cleavage of DNA by the type II restriction enzyme (EC 3.1.21.4) Nae I. We discovered two classes of Nae I restriction sites: sites susceptible and sites resistant to cleavage. Kinetic analysis showed that Nae I was activated by DNA containing cleavable Nae I sites to rapidly cleave resistant Nae I sites by a noncompetitive mechanism with a Km for substrate DNA of about 2 nM and a KA for activating DNA of about 6 nM; activation increased catalysis but not substrate binding. Deletion mutagenesis in vitro showed that sequences flanking the Nae I recognition site were responsible for the differences between activating and nonactivating Nae I sites. The polyamine spermidine had a dramatic effect on the interaction of Nae I with DNA; in the presence of 1 mM spermidine, resistant sites were cleaved rapidly and cleavable DNA inhibited cleavage. The direct regulation of enzymatic activity by DNA sequences in trans, and the modulation of this regulation by a polyamine that is sensitive to the cell cycle, provides a regulatory switch mechanism. The implications of this switch for biological control functions are discussed.\r"

M., Davis, J. Q. & Bennett, V. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 47-55, and Wong, A. J., Kiehart, D. P. & Pollard, T. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 46-49]; however, the molecular basis for this binding was unclear. The present studies employed immobilized monomeric myosin to examine the interaction of myosin with erythrocyte protein 4.1. In human erythrocytes, protein 4.1 binds to integral membrane proteins and mediates spectrin-actin assembly. Protein 4.1 binds to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin with a Kd = 140 nM and a stoichiometry consistent with 1:1 binding. Heavy meromyosin competes for protein 4.1 binding with Ki = 36-54 nM; however, the S1 fragment (the myosin head) competes less efficiently. Affinity chromatography of partial chymotryptic digests of protein 4.1 on immobilized myosin identified a 10-kDa domain of protein 4.1 as the myosin-binding site. In functional studies, protein 4.1 partially inhibited the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin with Ki = 51 nM. Liver cytosolic and erythrocyte myosins preactivated with myosin light-chain kinase were similarly inhibited by protein 4.1. These studies show that protein 4.1 binds, modulates, and thus may regulate myosin. This interaction might serve to generate the contractile forces involved in Mg2+-ATP-dependent shape changes in erythrocytes and may additionally serve as a model for myosin organization and regulation in non-muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive minimization and dynamics computational studies of the hammerhead structural domain of the virusoid of lucerne transient streak virus have been carried out. The following observations at the self-cleavage position are derived from the resulting three-dimensional structure: (i) the cytosine base is at the surface and does not interact with another base (it is free to move), and (ii) the ribose-phosphate backbone is forced to take an abrupt turn since it bridges stems I and III, and this turn points the pro-S and pro-R oxygens of the phosphate to the inward side of the hammerhead. These structural features are independent of the hammerhead being open or closed and allow an unencumbered 3'- to 2'-endo conformational change of the ribose with the resultant creation of an unusual stereochemistry that allows a direct in-line self-cleavage reaction. In the closed hammerhead structure, interactions of stems I and II create a vacancy into which the catalytic hydrated Mg(II) may be docked on labile phosphate. This opening is not present if stems I and II are shortened.\r"

Two major transcription start sites were mapped by S1 nuclease analysis to sites located 469 and 424 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon for translation. The 5' terminus of an insulin proreceptor cDNA, isolated from a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library, corresponds to the 3'-most major start site of transcription. The 5' deletion mutants of the 5' flanking region of the proreceptor gene, linked upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, were transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and assayed for promoter activity.

However, recent experiments have provided indirect evidence that a second DNA polymerase may play a role in DNA replication. To identify cellular proteins necessary for DNA synthesis in mammalian cells, we have been studying the cell-free system developed for the replication of simian virus 40 DNA. In this report, we present direct evidence that a second DNA polymerase is required in addition to DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex to obtain efficient replication of simian virus 40 origin-containing DNA. This DNA polymerase activity is not affected by monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the activity of DNA polymerase alpha and is relatively resistant to the inhibitor [N2-(p-n-butylphenyl)-9-(2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)guanine 5'-triphosphate]. Moreover, the activity of the polymerase is highly dependent upon the accessory protein, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen. These characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that this second DNA polymerase is DNA polymerase delta.\r"

A cross-hybridization procedure was developed to identify the authentic SRP14 cDNA clone among the amplified DNA products obtained by PCR. The basis of this approach is the assumption that a partial cDNA of SRP14 should be the only DNA product common to two amplification reactions primed with different degenerate oligonucleotide mixtures. The partial canine cDNA of SRP14 identified by this procedure served as a probe to isolate a complete cDNA clone of SRP14 from a mouse embryonic cDNA library in lambda phage gt10.\r"

SV40 large tumor antigen and human SSB can support extensive unwinding of SV40 origin-containing DNA in the presence of ATP and a topoisomerase that relieves positive superhelicity. Although SSBs from viral and prokaryotic sources substituted for human SSB in the DNA-unwinding reaction, they did not substitute in the replication of SV40 DNA. The specificity for human SSB in SV40 DNA replication can be explained, at least in part, by the finding that DNA polymerase alpha was stimulated 10-fold by human SSB but not by other SSBs. Human SSB also stimulated proliferating-cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA polymerase delta; however, other SSBs stimulated this polymerase as well.\r"

Southern blotting demonstrated the presence of only one human D2 receptor gene. Two overlapping phage containing the gene were isolated and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of these clones showed that the coding sequence is interrupted by six introns and that the additional amino acids present in the human pituitary receptor are encoded by a single exon of 87 base pairs.

We have cloned three related but distinct cDNAs encoding small nuclear ribonucleoparticle (snRNP)-associated proteins from rat PC12 cells. One clone (Sm51) has the capacity to encode a 240-amino acid protein and its RNA transcript is expressed selectively in rat brain and pituitary but not in heart. A related cDNA, designated Sm11, predicts a protein highly homologous to but distinct from Sm51. The Sm11 transcript is very abundant in heart but barely detectable in brain. Sm51 and Sm11 appear to encode the brain and heart forms of a 28-kDa snRNP-associated protein detected by anti-Sm serum, respectively. A third clone (Sm21) encodes a protein with an altered N terminus relative to Sm51. The Sm51 transcript is expressed in the pituitary, and analysis of the pituitaries of transgenic mice harboring a mouse metallothionein I promoter-calcitonin/CGRP fusion gene reveals the splice choice to be predominantly CGRP. In situ hybridization indicates Sm51 RNA is expressed throughout neuronal structures within rat brain, including the inferior colliculus, which does not possess the machinery to generate CGRP. Although Sm51 alone cannot be sufficient to account for CGRP splicing choice in all tissues, the demonstration of discrete tissue-specific expression patterns of closely related snRNP-associated proteins is consistent with their potential role in differential RNA processing events.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated cDNAs for the major heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2, B1, and C2 proteins and determined their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The A2 and B1 cDNAs are identical except for a 36-nucleotide in-frame insert in B1. Similarly, the sequence of the C2 protein cDNA is related to that of C1 in that C2 contains an extra 39 in-frame nucleotides. Therefore, the B1 amino acid sequence is identical to A2 except for the insertion of 12 amino acids near its amino terminus, and C1 and C2 are also identical to each other except for an extra 13 amino acids near the middle of C2. All three proteins are members of a large family of RNA binding proteins that contain the consensus sequence-type RNA binding domain (CS-RBD). The A2 and B1 proteins have a modular structure similar to that of the hnRNP protein A1: they contain two CS-RBDs and a glycine-rich auxiliary domain at the carboxyl terminus. The CS-RBDs of A2 and B1 have approximately 80% amino acid identity with those of A1, whereas the glycine-rich auxiliary domain is considerably more divergent with less than 30% of the amino acids being identical. These findings indicate that the addition of small peptides, probably by alternative pre-mRNA splicing, generates some of the diversity apparent among hnRNP proteins.\r"

Partial deletions of the NOS sequence abolished the accumulation of unspliced cytoplasmic mRNA, although the gene products of rex mutants were found in the nucleoplasm.

We have examined the binding of ICP4 to each of two A and two B binding sites by using Fab fragments of a monoclonal antibody that is reactive with an epitope located at the N terminus of ICP4 and that decreases the mobility of ICP4-DNA complexes in non-denaturing gels. The results indicate that each type of site binds two monomers of ICP4. Methylation-interference studies on the type B sites mapped the guanines whose methylation interfered with the binding of ICP4. The methylation-interference pattern obtained with one of the B sites was similar to that obtained on an A site but differed from that of the other B site. The ability of ICP4 to bind to DNA fragments containing the binding site appears to be dependent on length and on the proximity of the binding site to the fragment end. Short DNA fragments did not form stable complexes with ICP4 even though they contained all of the purines whose methylation interfered with the binding of the regulatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations on the steroid synthetic capability within the brain open the possibility that benzodiazepines may influence steroid synthesis in nervous tissue through interactions with peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites, which are highly expressed in steroidogenic cells and associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. To examine this possibility nine molecules that exhibit a greater than 10,000-fold difference in their affinities for peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites were tested for their effects on a well-established steroidogenic model system, the Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cell line. 4'-Chlorodiazepam, PK 11195, and PK 14067 stimulated steroid production by 2-fold in Y-1 cells, whereas diazepam, flunitrazepam, zolpidem, and PK 14068 displayed a lower (1.2- to 1.5-fold) maximal stimulation. In contrast, clonazepam and flumazenil did not stimulate steroid synthesis. The potencies of these compounds to inhibit 3H-labeled PK 11195 binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites correlated (r = 0.985) with their potencies to stimulate steroid production. Similar findings were observed in bovine and rat adrenocortical cell preparations. These results suggest that ligands of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition site acting on this mitochondrial receptor can enhance steroid production. This action may contribute specificity to the pharmacological profile of drugs preferentially acting on the benzodiazepine recognition site associated with the outer membrane of certain mitochondrial populations.\r"

To minimize artifactual distortions the tissue was examined, for the first time, as isolated fibrils in an aqueous environment of vitreous ice, as well as in conventionally prepared sections. The electron micrographs show that the plate-shaped apatite crystals are arranged in parallel arrays across the collagen fibrils. This provides direct evidence for highly asymmetric assembly in collagen fibrils, and, indeed, the fibrils were observed to be elongated rather than round in cross-section. There is, furthermore, a pronounced tendency for the layers of crystals to be coherently aligned in adjacent fibrils. These observations may also be important for understanding the mechanical behavior of bone at the molecular level, as such extended, aligned aggregates of flat crystals could develop into natural fracture planes in mature bone.\r"

Bacteriohodopsin (bR)-producing Halobacteria halobium were grown on a stringent medium containing either ring-perdeuterated proline or 15N-labeled proline. Comparison of the difference spectra obtained from the photoreactions of these labeled bR samples with those for unlabeled bR has led to the assignment of peaks due to proline vibrations. [proline-N15]bR exhibited a 15-cm-1 isotopic downshift of peaks in the 1420- to 1440-cm-1 region of the bR----K and bR----M difference spectra as well as a similar downshift of peaks found in the absolute absorption spectrum of bR. In contrast, [proline-D7]bR did not cause shifts in this region of the difference spectra. These results indicate that one or more prolines undergo a structural rearrangement during the bR photocycle involving the Xaa-Pro C--N peptide bond. This change may be directly coupled to the light-induced isomerization of the retinal chromophore from all-trans-retinal to 13-cis-retinal.\r"

We have reconstituted apo-aconitase with iron and selenide to obtain Fe4Se4 aconitase. The Se analog has higher catalytic activity than the native S-containing enzyme when isocitrate is the substrate. Oxidation of [Fe4Se4]2+ with ferricyanide yields the inactive [Fe3Se4]1+ form. The Se-containing 3-Fe cluster can be reduced to [Fe3Se4]0. We have studied the [Fe3S4]1+,0, [Fe3Se4]1+,0, and [Fe4Se4]2+ states with Mossbauer spectroscopy from 1.3 K to 200 K in magnetic fields up to 6.0 T. The spectra of the S- and Se-containing enzymes were found to be remarkably similar. The spectra of the 3-Fe clusters were analyzed and the salient features of the electronic structure are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A Na+ uptake-associated vacuolar alkalinization was observed in roots of two barley cultivars (Arivat and the more salt-tolerant California Mariout) by using 23Na and 31P in vivo NMR spectroscopy. A NaCl uptake-associated broadening was also noted for both vacuolar Pi and intracellular Na NMR peaks, consistent with Na+ uptake into the same compartment as the vacuolar Pi. A close coupling of Na+ with H+ transport (presumably the Na+/H+ antiport) in vivo was evidenced by qualitative and quantitative correlations between Na+ accumulation and vacuolar alkalinization for both cultivars. Prolongation of the low NaCl pretreatment (30 mM) increased the activity of the putative antiport in Arivat but reduced it in California Mariout. This putative antiport also showed a dependence on NaCl concentration for California Mariout but not for Arivat. No cytoplasmic acidification accompanied the antiporter activity for either cultivar. The response of adenosine phosphates indicated that ATP utilization exceeded the capacity for ATP synthesis in Arivat, but the two processes seemed balanced in California Mariout. These comparisons provide clues to the role of the tonoplast Na+/H+ antiport and compensatory cytoplasmic adjustments including pH, osmolytes, and energy phosphates in governing the different salt tolerance of the two cultivars.\r"

Inhibitor I and II proteins were identified by immunoblotting and quantified by immunoradial diffusion. Both inhibitors exhibited the molecular weights found for the native proteins in their natural environments. Extracts of leaves from transformed plants contained inhibitory activities against trypsin and chymotrypsin that reflected the levels of inhibitor I or II protein present. The results demonstrate that in tobacco leaves the introns of both inhibitor I and inhibitor II genes were excised correctly and that pre and prepro inhibitor I and II proteins were correctly processed. Growth of Manduca sexta larvae (tobacco hornworms) feeding on leaves of transgenic plants containing inhibitor II, a powerful inhibitor of both trypsin and chymotrypsin, was significantly retarded, compared to growth of larvae fed untransformed leaves. Levels of inhibitor II protein as low as 50 micrograms/g of tissue moderately affected larval growth, whereas levels above 100 micrograms/g severely reduced growth. The presence of tomato inhibitor I protein, a potent inhibitor of chymotrypsin but a weak inhibitor of trypsin, in transgenic tobacco leaves had little effect on the growth of the larvae. These experiments indicated that trypsin inhibitory activity, but not chymotrypsin inhibitory activity, was mainly responsible for the inhibition of larval growth.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine adrenal medullary cells, cultured on quartz plates, were superfused with buffer to which pulses of stimulant were added. Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured by the fura-2 fluorescence method and the simultaneously released catecholamine was measured electrochemically. When stimulant concentrations were adjusted to given equivalent elevations of cytosolic Ca2+, secretion depended entirely on whether Ca2+ came from internal stores or from the extracellular medium. Calcium from internal stores did not support secretion under these conditions. This nonequivalence of the two sources of cytosolic Ca2+ points to important differences in the physiological roles of the two sources of calcium. Dimethylphenylpiperazinium (a cholinergic agonist) and elevated K+ increased cytosolic Ca2+ and caused secretion only in the presence of external Ca2+. Bradykinin, muscarine, and ATP elevated cytosolic Ca2+ in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+ but caused secretion only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. UTP, which in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ elevated cytosolic Ca2+ as effectively as ATP, did not cause detectable secretion under any circumstance. Because of the high Ca2+-buffering capacity of the cytosol, we expected that Ca2+ gradients, perhaps quite steep, would be produced by a pulse of Ca2+ entering the cytosol. Fura-2 fluorescence measures only the average free cytosolic Ca2+. Our data show that Ca2+ entering across the plasma membrane was much more effective at triggering exocytosis than was Ca2+ released from internal stores, suggesting that the two sources of Ca2+ are effectively compartmentalized, probably by concentration gradients in the cytosol.\r"

Surprisingly, during transient expression, the E1B 19-kDa protein specifically associated with and disrupted the organization of intermediate filaments and the nuclear lamina, without disturbing the organization of other cytoskeletal networks. These results directly demonstrate an effect of a viral transforming protein on the cytoskeleton and suggest a role for intermediate filaments and the nuclear lamina in modulation of viral gene expression and the process of oncogenic transformation.\r"

MUC18 is expressed only sporadically in benign melanocytic nevi and thin primary melanomas that have a low probability of metastasizing. However, with increasing tumor thickness, MUC18 expression becomes more frequent and it is found on 80% of advanced primary tumors and metastases. MUC18-encoding cDNA clones were obtained by screening a human melanoma phage lambda expression library with monoclonal antibodies produced against the denatured antigen. The deduced sequence of 603 amino acids consists of a signal peptide, five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The highest sequence similarity is with a group of nervous system cell adhesion molecules, which includes neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). The close structural relationship with these molecules suggests that MUC18 may also be a developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecule.\r"

Adhesion of the human melanoma cell line LOX to laminin was inhibited by anti-VLA alpha 2 antibodies. Because VLA-2-mediated LOX cell attachment to laminin was not inhibited by digestion with collagenase, collagen contamination of laminin was not a factor. In addition, VLA-2 from LOX cells bound to immobilized laminin, and binding was disrupted by EDTA but not by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides. VLA-3 also bound to laminin-Sepharose, although less avidly than VLA-2. Thus, at least four separate members of the integrin beta 1 subfamily serve as laminin receptors--i.e., VLA-2 and VLA-3 (this study) together with VLA-1 and VLA-6 (other reports). Whereas LOX and other cell lines used VLA-2 as both a laminin and collagen receptor, fibroblast VLA-2 mediated collagen but not laminin binding. Likewise, VLA-2 from platelets did not interact with laminin. Despite this functional discordancy, VLA-2 from laminin-binding and nonbinding sources was indistinguishable by all immunochemical and biochemical criteria examined. Thus, functional differences in VLA-2 may be due to cell type-specific modulation.\r"

They were highly specific for bFGF from bovine, human, and mouse sources and did not cross-react with bovine heparin-binding growth factor I (HBGF-I)/acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). The immunoglobulin class and subclass of these mAbs were IgG1, K. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for bFGF of these mAbs ranged from 10(-9) to 10(-10) M. One mAb (bFM-2) also cross-reacted with heat-inactivated bFGF, while the other mAb (bFM-1) did not, suggesting that bFM-1 recognized the conformation of the bFGF molecule necessary for its biological activity. These mAbs inhibited growth of cultured bovine capillary endothelial cells in both the presence and absence of exogenous bFGF, indicating the autocrine action of this growth factor in in vitro growth of these cells. On the other hand, injection of these hybridoma cell lines s.c. into the backs of athymic mice resulted in development of highly vascularized solid tumors and a sustained high level of anti-bFGF activity in the blood of the tumor-bearing mice. These findings suggest that bFGF is not essential as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor for angiogenesis in vivo. These mAbs should be useful in further studies on the physiological role and the conformation-function relationship of bFGF because they block its biological activity.\r"

When the CHO-K1 cells were pulse labeled and subsequently permeabilized with 50 micrograms of saponin per ml, there was no significant turnover of nascent phosphatidyl[3H]serine to form phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine during an ensuing chase. Saponin treatment rendered greater than 99% of the cells permeable as judged by trypan blue exclusion and depleted them of 85% of their complement of cytosolic proteins as determined by residual lactic acid dehydrogenase activity. Supplementation of the permeabilized cells with 2 mM ATP resulted in significant phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine synthesis (83% of that found in intact cells) from phosphatidyl[3H]serine during a subsequent 2-hr chase. Phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine synthesis essentially ceased after 2 hr in the permeabilized cells. The translocation-dependent synthesis of phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine was a saturable process with respect to ATP concentration in permeabilized cells. The conversion of phosphatidyl[3H]serine to phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine did not occur in saponin-treated cultures supplemented with 2 mM AMP, 2 mM 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, or apyrase (2.5 units/ml) plus 2 mM ATP. ATP was the most effective nucleotide, but the addition of GTP, CTP, UTP, and ADP also supported the translocation-dependent synthesis of phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine albeit to a lesser extent. These data provide evidence that the interorganelle translocation of phosphatidylserine requires ATP and is largely independent of soluble cytosolic proteins.\r"

Many droplets of all sizes were associated with the cell membranes. A cooled and then rewarmed lens was found to lose its opacity and subsequently no droplets were observed, indicating that there was a good correlation between the onset of opacification and the formation of droplets. Electron microscopy showed that droplets were composed of homogeneous electron-dense aggregates without limiting membranes. ImmunoGold study revealed that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins were all present within each droplet. This study demonstrates that extensive accumulation of the crystallin droplets in the lens nucleus is the contributing factor for the light scattering and opacification of the cold cataract in the young intact rat lens.\r"

  ".W": "Dog pancreas rough microsomes were solubilized in 1% octyl beta-glucoside, and membrane vesicles were reconstituted by slow 30-fold dilution with a buffer of low ionic strength. Asymmetric assembly of the membranes occurred during reconstitution since the vesicles formed contained ribosomes bound only to the vesicular outer surfaces. The reconstituted vesicles were similar in protein composition to native rough microsomes, although these vesicles were largely devoid of luminal-content proteins. These reconstituted vesicles could translocate and process nascent secretory (human placental lactogen) and membrane proteins (influenza hemagglutinin and rat liver ribophorin I) synthesized in cell-free translation systems programmed with the corresponding mRNAs. Signal cleavage and N-glycosylation only occurred when the reconstituted membranes were present during translation, providing evidence that the translocation apparatus was asymmetrically assembled into the reconstituted membranes. When a supernatant lacking ribosomes and particles greater than 50S from centrifuging the detergent-solubilized microsomes at high speed was used for reconstitution, smooth-surfaced membrane vesicles were obtained that, except for the absence of ribosomal proteins, were similar in protein composition to that of the reconstituted vesicles from total solubilized rough microsomes. The reconstituted smooth-surfaced vesicles, however, were totally inactive in cotranslational processing and translocation of nascent polypeptides. These findings suggest that ribosomes and/or large macromolecular complexes, not dissociated under our solubilization conditions, are essential for in vitro assembly of a functional translocation apparatus.\r"

Surprisingly, no homologue of the segmentation gene fushi tarazu was found in the honeybee. For the remaining bee gene, a Drosophila homologue is not known. This indicates that, with some exceptions, structurally homologous genes are involved in the control of bee and Drosophila development, although Hymenoptera differ significantly in their embryogenesis from Diptera and have evolved separately for some 250 million years.\r"

The segregation of MGR sequences in genetic crosses and hybridization of MGR probes to separated, chromosome-size DNA molecules of M. grisea shows that this family of sequences is distributed among the M. grisea chromosomes. MGR sequences also hybridize to discrete poly(A)+ RNAs. Southern blot analysis using a MGR probe can distinguish rice pathogens from various sources. However, MGR sequences are not highly conserved in the genomes of M. grisea field isolates that do not infect rice. These results suggest that host selection for a specific pathogen genotype has occurred during the breeding and cultivation of rice.\r"
