Mean hospital stay (including ileostomy closure) was 24 +/- 8 days. The reservoir has been removed in one patient (one week postoperatively) who was found to have a Dukes' B rectal carcinoma. Function has been assessed in 51 patients (mean follow-up 18.6 +/- 8.9 months). Frequency of defaecation per 24 h is 3.3 +/- 1.0 (range 1-8) with night evacuation in 14 per cent. Antidiarrhoeal medication is required by 20 per cent of patients. Continence is normal in 92 per cent, and 8 per cent have minor leakage. All patients defaecate spontaneously.\r"

Three main types of ileal pouch construction are used, but the advocacy of each probably arises more from familiarity and convenience than from scientific considerations. Since, other things being equal, pouch capacity can be expected to affect stool frequency, it seemed reasonable to examine calculable pouch capacity geometrically for different methods of construction. A mathematical model was therefore used to compare the double loop ('J') type with the quadruple loop ('W') construction. The W was estimated to have a capacity more than half as great again as the J. Similarly anastomotic methods which encroach on the ileal circumference by creating an inverted edge can be expected to reduce resultant capacity by 10 per cent or more.\r"

After exclusion of patients who were diagnosed as having a primary cancer before the ulcer operation and 0.5 per cent of the patients whose present status could not be defined, 2975 men and 943 women survived more than one month after the operation and thus formed the cohort of the study. They were followed up to their death or the end of the year 1982. Eighty-four colorectal carcinomas were observed against the expected 85.9. There was no significant difference between observed or expected number of cancers neither among men nor women.\r"

Studies to assess anal sphincter function, rectal sensation to balloon distension, rectal compliance, and perineal descent did not show any significant differences between pruritic patients and controls. However, pruritic patients without co-existing anal pathology had a significantly greater fall of anal pressure when a rectal balloon was inflated (57 per cent) when compared with controls (40 per cent) P less than 0.05.\r"

The frequency of breast diseases in this population was fibro-adenoma, 48 per cent; carcinoma, 21 per cent; breast abscess, 8.6 per cent; fibrocystic disease, 5.5 per cent; sclerosing adenosis, 5.4 per cent and gynaecomastia, 2.7 per cent. The other breast lesions were the same type of disease as documented in white patients. The most striking difference was the relatively high incidence of fibro-adenoma, especially in nulliparous adolescent females, while carcinoma and fibrocystic disease were fewer than expected. Breast carcinoma presented a decade earlier in Nigerian women and was usually advanced at presentation and of aggressive histological type. Of the breast carcinomas, 4.3 per cent were associated with pregnancy.\r"

In premenopausal women with breast cancer, 53 per cent of ER-positive tumours were capable of binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose (activated ER): the corresponding proportion in postmenopausal patients was 70 per cent (P less than 0.005). Disease recurrence was significantly increased in patients whose tumours contained non-activated rather than activated ER. The presence of activated ER was associated with a significant increase in the median activity of creatine kinase in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. In postmenopausal patients the incidence of progesterone receptor was higher in tumours that contained activated ER than in tumours that contained ER not capable of binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose (non-activated). The incidence of activated ER was not related to disease stage or nodal involvement at the time of sampling. The data suggest that ER-positive tumours can be divided, according to the activity of the DNA-binding site, into subgroups with differing biological properties.\r"

We have reviewed all 59 patients with malignant disease of the breast aged 35 years or less managed in the Breast Unit at Charing Cross Hospital between 1974 and 1984. After exclusion of 5 patients (2 with lymphomas, 1 with fibrosarcoma, and 2 with inadequate available data), 54 patients were available for analysis. More than 3 months delay from first symptoms to presentation was seen in 45 per cent and 36 per cent were considered 'late' at initial clinical staging (T3-4, N2-3 or M1). Nevertheless, a 5-year survival of 66 per cent was seen among the 29 patients with sufficient length of follow-up. Distribution among the main histological types was very similar to that found in a consecutive series of 264 breast cancers of all age groups in our unit. We conclude that breast carcinomas in young patients do not significantly differ in type or behaviour from other age groups and that with treatment similar to other premenopausal patients, a prognosis comparable to older patients can be expected.\r"

All patients not responding to treatment in the first hour were given a repeat dosage and observed for the following 3 hours. Among this group, there was a significant remission of ileus in patients who had received 2 X 8 mg, which was particularly marked in those who had undergone intraperitoneal surgery.

In all cases, barium meal failed to define the early nature of this disease. Only two lesions were thought to be EGC endoscopically and at laparotomy three were considered to be EGC.

Cure was achieved in 74 per cent of all patients (83 of 112 patients) who underwent PAD, but in only 50 per cent of patients with multiple intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 16), 50 per cent of patients with complex pancreatic inflammatory disease (n = 8) and 57 per cent of patients with complex intraparenchymal abscesses (n = 7). PAD contributed to cure in eight of nine patients with enteric communicating abscesses. The transhepatic route to perihepatic abscesses proved to be safe. Complications occurred in nine patients (8 per cent). No relationship was noted between the severity or number of complications and the indication for PAD. Of the 29 failures of PAD, 17 patients were cured by either surgical intervention (14 patients) or a second PAD (1 patient) or a combination of the two methods (2 patients). Twelve patients (11 per cent) died, eight from sepsis due to inadequate drainage. Frequent reassessment by ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT) in patients with prolonged sepsis after PAD is mandatory. These results justify a place for PAD in the management of the often critically ill patient with complex abdominal inflammatory disease.\r"

  ".W": "One-hundred and twenty-eight orchidopexies performed between 1979 and 1981 were reviewed in 1985, and the results compared with the results of operations performed in 1972. The age of referral has been determined for 1972, 1979-1981 and 1985. The number of unsatisfactory results has decreased from 35 per cent in 1972 to 9.4 per cent between 1979 and 1981. Five cases of the 'ascending testicle' were discovered, confirming the importance of this phenomenon. We suggest that the optimum age for orchidopexy is during the second year of life; however, during 1985, only 20 per cent of boys referred for orchidopexy were under 3 years of age. Doctors performing neonatal examinations should consider the possibility of cryptorchidism and ensure that affected neonates are reviewed at 1 year. The potential theoretical advantages of orchidopexy at an early age will only be converted into clinical benefit if the operation is performed by an experienced surgeon who has developed an expertise in this area of surgery.\r"

One solution is to restrict children's access to cigarettes, thereby reducing consumption of the product and, ultimately, damage to health. This study found that in 1985 the majority of Manitoba public school children 8 to 15 years of age who smoked \"regularly\" (defined as usually every day) obtained their cigarettes from stores. This source could be reduced, if not eliminated, were a federal regulation passed in 1908 enforced. Under Canada's Tobacco Restraint Act it is illegal for merchants to sell tobacco to anyone under the age of 16 years. By implementing this existing law, authorities would not only be keeping the profit from almost a million dollars in cigarette sales in Manitoba alone out of tobacco company coffers but also be having an impact on the leading cause of preventable premature death and disability in Canada.\r"

Twenty-nine patients with diverse malignancies were studied with Holter monitors on 33 postdoxorubicin days. Control recordings were made on days remote from doxorubicin treatment. The frequency of arrhythmia that could be attributed to doxorubicin was low: 3% of studies in the first hour postinfusion and 24% of studies in 1 to 24 hours postinfusion. The most commonly seen arrhythmia was an increased frequency of ventricular premature beats. Arrhythmia following doxorubicin infusion is rare in the first hour and more common in the remainder of the first 24 hours postinfusion. There are no acute or long-term adverse consequences related to the appearance of arrhythmia due to doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal local-regional treatment for patients with Stage III breast cancer has not been determined. To evaluate the effectiveness of radiation therapy as local treatment for such patients, the results of 192 patients (five with bilateral disease) treated with radiation therapy without mastectomy between July 1, 1968 and December 31, 1981 were reviewed. Excisional biopsy (gross tumor removal) was performed in only 54 of the 197 breasts. Patients typically received 4500 to 5000 cGy in 5 weeks to the breast and draining lymph nodes; a local boost to areas of gross disease was delivered to 157 patients. Multi-agent chemotherapy was given to 53 patients. The median follow-up was 65 months. The actuarial probability of survival for the entire group was 41% at 5 years and 23% at 10 years. The probability of relapse-free survival (RFS) was 30% at 5 years and 19% at 10 years. The addition of multi-agent chemotherapy was associated with a significantly improved 5-year RFS (40% versus 26%, P = 0.02). The 5-year survival rate was 51% for patients who received adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy and 38% for patients who did not (P = 0.16). The actuarial rate of local-regional tumor control (not censored for distant failure) for all patients was 73% at 5 years and 68% at ten years, and the crude incidence of local-regional control was 78%. Local-regional tumor control was principally influenced by radiation dose. Patients who received 6000 cGy or greater to the primary site had a better 5-year rate of control in the breast than did patients who received less than 6000 cGy (83% versus 70%, P = 0.06). Significant complications were seen in 15 patients (8%); these included moderate or severe arm edema in six patients and brachial plexopathy in four patients. Cosmetic results at last evaluation were excellent or good in 56% of evaluable patients, fair in 25%, and poor in 19%. It is concluded that high-dose radiation therapy without mastectomy is an effective means of controlling local-regional tumor in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in mediastinal and lung dimensions during respiration were studied to assess the potential of radiotherapy gated to respiration to minimize normal tissue irradiation. Twelve patients with mediastinal Hodgkin's disease were assessed using chest radiographs and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans both during quiet breathing and at maximum inspiration in the standing, supine, and prone positions. A simple measure of the bulk of mediastinal disease, the ratio of the width of mediastinal mass to thoracic diameter, was determined from posteroanterior (PA) chest radiographs. The volumes of mediastinum, irradiated and protected lung if anteroposterior (AP) and PA mantle fields were used were determined from sequential thoracic CT scans and three-dimensional treatment planning and compared at quiet breathing and deep inspiration. The mediastinal width to thoracic diameter ratio decreased from quiet breathing to deep inspiration an average of 3%, 9%, and 11% for the standing, supine, and prone positions, respectively. Lung volumes as measured from the thoracic CT scans showed that on average, 8% more lung was protected at deep inspiration than at quiet breathing, independent of treatment position. The maximum increase in the percentage of protected lung from quiet breathing to deep inspiration was seen in patients with extensive mediastinal adenopathy suggesting that radiotherapy gated to respiration may be most advantageous in the subset of patients.\r"

Seven of 12 resected HCC revealed cytoplasmic dense bodies ultrastructurally in which an x-ray microanalyzer demonstrated copper. OPHM in HCC, a granular accumulation, was concluded to be rich in copper-protein complex, and might correspond to dense bodies derived from lysosome ultrastructurally. The pathogenesis and biologic significance of this copper overload in a number of HCC are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Polyamine biosynthetic activity was assessed in various colorectal tissue samples consisting of noninvolved mucosa, benign adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinomas taken at surgery from a total of 40 patients. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) displayed a gradient of enzyme activity (i.e., adenocarcinoma greater than polyps greater than mucosa) which seemed to correlate positively with the neoplastic status of the tissue. In 10 of the patients, samples were obtained for all three tissue types. Five of these exhibited a clear repetition of the trends in enzyme activity seen with the mixed patient tissue sampling whereas the remainder differed by having the highest ODC activity in the polyps. In nine of the ten cases, ODC activity was substantially lower in the mucosa than in either of the neoplastic lesions. Trends in enzyme activity were the same for tissues obtained from either the colon or rectum. The ODC activity in adenocarcinomas could not be correlated with histologic differentiation, stage or site of the disease, however, in samples from female patients (all postmenopausal) the activity was elevated over normal mucosa to a greater extent (ten-fold) than in male patients (seven-fold). S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity was assessed in 27 of the 40 patients and found to follow the same distribution as ODC; however, the mean value differences +/- SEM between tissues were less distinct. In general, tissue polyamine pool analysis of these same specimens reflected the levels of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities. Overall, the data reveal an increase in polyamine biosynthetic activity in colorectal neoplasms, relative to surrounding mucosa, which may correlate with (1) progression of the neoplastic process, (2) the proportion of proliferating cells, (3) the rate of cell proliferation, or (4) a combination of two or all of these possibilities.\r"

The methods gave similar information on the DNA content and the correlation was 0.94. In eight patients tumor imprints were prepared and the DNA content was analyzed with static cytometry. A correlation coefficient of 0.83 between flow cytometry on fresh tumor tissue and static cytometry was found. Sixty-two percent of the tumors were aneuploid and had significantly higher S-phase values than diploid tumors. Histologic grade was not related to ploidy level, whereas Dukes' C tumors often were aneuploid. When the clinical course of patients was analyzed by log rank test (mean follow-up, 30.4 months), the patients with diploid tumors showed a clear advantage in terms of survival; only two patients in this group developed progressive disease. It is concluded that the DNA content is an independent prognostic predictor of colorectal carcinoma and that DNA can be analyzed by several methods. Of these, the method using disintegrated paraffin sections appears most attractive.\r"

Our study showed the presence of gold particles in cytoplasmic vesicles and granules, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and occasional lysosomal dense bodies in columnar or cuboidal cells of acini from normal, BPH and well-differentiated cancerous specimens, but not in the acinar basal cells. Some moderately differentiated and most poorly differentiated tumors contained undifferentiated neoplastic cells in which PSA localizations often were associated with membranous structures since specific cytoplasmic organelles were not differentiated. In prostatic stroma, invasive cells which were of differentiated type localized gold particles. In addition, some neutrophils and macrophages also localized PSA suggesting their role in phagocytosis of extracellularly released PSA in the stroma of BPH and cancerous samples. Thus far, the authors have not observed neutrophils and macrophages with gold particles in normal prostate. We suggest that neutrophils and macrophages were involved in transport of some extracellularly released PSA from the prostatic stroma or other metastatic sites to sera in BPH and cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective adjuvant trial including patients with primary operable breast cancer, invasive carcinomas of ductal type were subjected to histological malignancy grading. The parameters investigated were tubule formation, number of mitoses and cell pleomorphism. A Cox regression model for survival data was applied to evaluate the impact of the histological parameters on prognosis in 1809 patients with low-risk carcinomas. Cell pleomorphism proved superior to the other histologic tumor characteristics. It was found that low-risk invasive ductal carcinomas with severe cell pleomorphism had an excess recurrence intensity of 209% relative to carcinomas with no pleomorphism. It is therefore suggested that polymorphous invasive ductal breast carcinomas, other things being equal, should be regarded as high-risk tumors in future clinical trials. Finally it was found that the tripartite malignancy grading 1, 2 and 3 characterizing each of the histological parameters was not equidistant. Consequently, the traditional tripartite histologic scoring needs reconsideration.\r"

Results were related to results from radiographic bone survey, 99mTc MDP bone scintigraphy, clinical examination and serum alkaline phosphatase and serum calcium levels. Eighty-seven patients (23%) had tumor cells in the bone marrow. X-rays showed metastases in 78% of the patients with and in 16% of the patients without bone marrow carcinosis. The diagnostic efficiency of x-rays with bone marrow biopsy as the key diagnostic factor was 83%, and it was superior to that of other investigation methods. Bone tissue biopsies were positive alone in 15 patients (17%) and marrow aspirations were positive alone in seven patients (8%). Imprint preparations were positive alone in 7% of the patients and bone tissue biopsy in 5% of the patients. Heavy tumor infiltration (greater than or equal to 50%) of the bone marrow was associated with the occurrence of numerous regions of radiographically involved bone lesions and with histopathologic evidence of bone destruction. Furthermore, pronounced bone formation and marrow fibrosis were more commonly seen in patients with osteosclerotic bone metastases than in patients with osteolytic bone metastases. This study provides evidence that the primary soil of metastatic bone disease in human breast cancer is the bone marrow and that radiographic evidence of bone metastases is a result of an invasion and destruction of the bone tissue matrix by tumor cells from the marrow cavity.\r"

  ".W": "Of 920 patients with histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma (RCC) seen at University of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital over a 10-year period, 44 (4.8%) had the sarcomatoid variant. The authors show that, although sarcomatoid RCC has as common denominators with classic RCC in certain epidemiologic parameters such as age and sex, its biologic behavior is different. It is more malignant, has a higher metastatic rate, ultimate recurrence in localized disease which translates to a shorter survival time. Metastasis at presentation, advanced age (older than 59 years) and female sex were a associate with a worse prognosis. This entity is characterized by a high incidence of bone metastasis at presentation (48%) and by a tendency toward pathologic bone fractures. All of the untreated patients died very soon after diagnosis (median, 3.8 months), whereas all of the patients treated with the various systemic modalities initiated only in the presence of metastatic disease survived significantly longer (median, 13.0 months). Of the eight patients who were treated with doxorubicin HCI chemotherapy regimens two (on CYVADIC) showed complete responses and are the only survivors (50, 65 months). Four patients treated with interferon had the longest median survival (41.0 months). These results suggest that CYVADIC chemotherapy should be combined with interferon in this entity. Since surgery is not curative in early stages of sarcomatoid RCC, adjuvant therapy with those agents should be considered.\r"

Actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years for the local therapy group (92% and 88%, respectively) were essentially equivalent to those for the conventional therapy group (92% and 90%, respectively), however, the recurrence experience after local therapy was less favorable. Local therapy consisted of vaginectomy in nine cases, local excision alone in 17 cases, and local irradiation (with or without local excision) in 17 cases. The subgroup of patients receiving local irradiation had a recurrence experience as favorable as that of the conventional therapy group and more favorable than that of either the subgroup treated with vaginectomy or local excision alone. The data suggest that when employed, local therapy should include local irradiation.\r"

Two types of clear germ cells were differentiated histochemically, and one with PLAP-positive cell surfaces and glycogen-rich cytoplasm was considered to be atypical. The alkaline phosphatase of atypical germ cells appeared to be similar to that found in a few germ cells of early fetal testes. The atypical germ cells seemed to be multi-potential malignant cells capable of developing not only into seminoma but also into other germ cell tumors. Only in yolk sac tumor of infants were the atypical germ cells absent from tumor-adjacent seminiferous tubules.\r"

In an attempt to explain this inverse age-stage relationship we studied 9062 histologically confirmed cases of lung carcinoma occurring from 1975 to 1984 obtained from the regional cancer registry for Kansas and western Missouri. They were analyzed according to histologic type, age, sex, and stage at diagnosis. The data suggest that the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma rises and that of adenocarcinoma and small cell undifferentiated carcinoma falls with increasing age. The proportion of staged lung carcinoma with local disease at the time of diagnosis increases with age. In males this trend occurred in all cell types except large cell undifferentiated carcinoma but was most significant for squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was the only group to show a significant trend among females. The rise in squamous cell and fall in small cell carcinoma may partially explain the increased prevalence of local stage disease with advancing age.\r"

These procedures are less morbid than conventional surgical techniques so that the indications for urinary diversion due to untreated or relapsing malignancy have to be reconsidered. During the period of technological change from 1978 to 1984, 135 patients with unilateral (37) or bilateral (98) MUO were managed. Open nephrostomy is now almost never necessary. Initial retrograde ureteral stenting (RS) was successful under local anaesthesia in 41% of patients. Forty-seven had percutaneous nephrostomy (PN), nine of whom underwent antegrade ureteral stenting (AS) and elimination of external appliances. Twenty-nine patients underwent miscellaneous open procedures mostly in the earlier years, with a 57% morbidity rate compared to the minimal morbidity associated with the newer techniques. The overall mean survival post diversion was 9.9 months, which is significantly longer than that reported using open procedures. MUO can now be successfully relieved with little morbidity and frequently without the use of external urine collection devices. The relative ease of diversion can complicate decision making in patients with progressive renal failure due to bilateral MUO.\r"

Clinical, surgical, and pathologic characteristics were evaluated in 64 patients treated with whole pelvic irradiation and intracavitary radium followed by hysterectomy at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute from January 1965 to December 1983. Comparison of 5-year actuarial survival rates revealed the following statistically significant categories: age, grade, depth of myometrial invasion, disease extent at surgery including lymph node metastases, and pelvic cytology. Race, weight, and cell type were not significant prognostic factors. Evaluation of prognostic factors at surgery includes pelvic and para-aortic lymph node biopsies, omental biopsy, pelvic cytologic washings, and biopsy of any suspicious tissues. Patients with adverse prognostic factors are candidates for trials with adjuvant therapy.\r"

Their history of organic solvent exposure is described. A significant overrisk of developing acute leukemia was found when comparison between patients and controls revealed a difference in the solvent exposure rate, which was significantly higher in patients than in controls, with an estimated odds ratio (OR) of 4.9, 95% CI (2.2 to 12.1). The most frequently exposed profession, painters, exhibit a relative risk of 13 (2.0 to 554). These results suggest that an etiologic relationship exists between organic solvent exposure and the development of acute leukemia in man.\r"

Fifty percent of the gastric ulcers in the Mexican population were malignant as compared to 6% in the non-Mexican population (P less than 0.05). In addition, a subset of aggressive carcinomas were found. Patients presenting with symptoms of less than 6 months' duration had a survival of less than 6 months, compared to the less aggressive subset, in which patients had symptoms for greater than 6 months and survived longer than 6 months. Racial, environmental influences, or selection bias may account for the differences in gastric carcinoma in the Mexican and non-Mexican population. Factors contributing to a more aggressive form of carcinoma are unclear and require further study.\r"

The sample included 90 medical oncologists, 65 surgeons, and 29 radiotherapists. Responses to individual questions are presented in three global categories: (1) physician role--physicians believed that their view of their professional \"self\" was not compatible with informed consent regulations; (2) physician autonomy--physicians perceived a loss of individual decision-making power and an increase in professional accountability; and (3) physician-patient relationship--physicians stated that informed consent regulations influenced what they told trial patients and affected the ensuing doctor-patient relationship. Respondents developed complex methods to accommodate the incongruities they perceived between their view of their professional self and the need to obtain informed consent.\r"

One patient was alive after 12 years; eight died. Twenty-five patients were given a similar regimen (with two fractions of radiotherapy per day), aiming at surgery. Twelve patients could undergo surgery. Two were alive 11 and 3.5 years after diagnosis. One patient died free of tumor after 6.5 years. Of the remaining 22 patients, many died of metastatic disease. A combination of preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil) and surgery during the remission has given a 12% (four of 34) survival (greater than 3 years). All survivors had undergone surgery. The patients who died had in many cases achieved local tumor control. Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) once a week replaced BCF due to treatment complications in patients receiving BCF.

The complication rate associated with the procedure was low. This form of regional chemotherapy has significant advantages over the conventional form that uses drugs given through the retrograde temporal artery because the catheter-related complications are eliminated, the perfusion of the tumor can be maintained consistently, and, consequently, the response rate is high and the duration of response is increased.\r"

Fever was the most common symptom, present in 57 of the 68 patients. Three morphologic types of stromal histiocytes were recognized: medium-sized cells similar to those seen in reactive follicles, characterized by distinct cytoplasm and cell borders, and uniform nuclei (Type A); damaged-appearing Type A cells marked by rarefied or ragged cytoplasm, disrupted or indistinct cell borders, and varying sized nuclei (Type B); and large spindling or stellate cells (Type C). Type A cells were predominant in 52 patients; Type B cells in 51; Type C cells in seven; and Type A cells were mixed with Type B in 30. Fever was present in one of 52 patients (1.9%) with Type A predominance; 43 of 51 (84.3%) with Type B cell predominance; none of seven (0%) with Type C predominance; and 13 of 30 (43.3%) with mixed Type A and B cells. Logistic regression analysis of the data showed that the association of fever with Type B cell predominance was highly significant, and was not attributable to the known association of fever with other variables. Morphologic evidence suggests that fever in Hodgkin's disease may be a clinical manifestation of damaged macrophage-histiocytes rather than an acute-phase response of inflammatory or immune reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven patients with soft tissue sarcoma had preoperative radiotherapy, limb-sparing marginal surgical resection and whole-mount tumor histologic analysis. Incisional biopsy specimens before radiotherapy were reviewed for tumor type, grade, and extent of necrosis. Preoperative radiotherapy was given in either of two regimens: 13 patients received a mean total dose of 5250 cGy in one daily 180 to 200 cGy fractions and 14 patients a mean total dose of 4770 cGy in two daily fractions of 180 to 200 cGy separated by 4 hours. Twenty-one specimens had at least 80% necrosis or severely altered cells, a 3+ to 4+ response. Grade and size of the tumor appeared to be indicators of response to treatment rather than histologic type. Three of five patients (60%) with Grade 1, eight of 11 patients (73%) with Grade 2 lesions, and ten of 11 patients (91%) with Grade 3 tumors had 80% or greater necrosis or severely altered cells. For tumors 10 cm or less in greatest diameter, the 3+ to 4+ histologic response was seen in 12 of 14 patients (86%) whereas for lesions greater than 10 cm, this response was observed in nine of 13 patients (69%). For patients with Grade 2 or 3 soft tissue sarcoma, 13 of 14 patients (93%) treated with two fractions per day and two of four patients (50%) receiving one fraction per day exhibited significant response. All six patients treated twice daily for lesions greater than 10 cm had 3+ to 4+ histologic response compared to three of seven (43%) patients treated once per day. Therefore, grade and size of soft tissue sarcoma are important predictors of response to radiotherapy and preoperative twice daily radiotherapy may more likely permit the conservative surgical excision of sarcomas of borderline resectability.\r"

Four of 29 patients with intermediate-grade or high-grade malignant lymphoma treated with CT and RT relapsed whereas eight of 13 patients treated with RT alone relapsed. Actuarial survival curves differed significantly in favour of the CT and RT group. These figures were also significant when the high-grade lymphomas plus centroblastic lymphomas were considered. It is recommended to add CT to RT in both Stage I and II NHL of high-grade and intermediate-grade malignancy.\r"

Biopsy specimens from the mediastinal lymph nodes demonstrated granulomas, suggesting the diagnosis of nodular sarcoidosis. Needle aspiration of the pulmonary nodules, however, revealed metastatic testis cancer. Sarcoid-like mediastinal reactions occur after resection of testis cancer, but biopsies should be performed on coexisting pulmonary nodules to exclude pulmonary metastases.\r"

Nine developed pelvic recurrences, two developed pelvic recurrences and distant metastases and one developed distant metastases only from six to 72 months (mean, 19 months) after initial treatment. Eight of these 12 patients died at two to 13 months (mean, 8 months) after secondary treatment, two are alive with residual pelvic tumor, and two are clinically free of disease at 7 and 48 months.

Malignant pleural effusions developed in 63 patients (24.7%), and their median survival (from the time of diagnosis of the effusion) was 6 months. Parenchymal liver metastases developed in 24 patients (9.4%; median survival, 5 months); parenchymal lung metastases in 18 patients (7.1%; median survival, 8 months); distant lymph node metastases in 18 patients (7.1%; median survival, 9 months); subcutaneous nodules in nine patients (3.5%; median survival, 12 months); a malignant pericardial effusion in six patients (2.4%; median survival, 2.3 months); central nervous system metastases in five patients (2%; median survival, 1.3 months); and bone metastases in four patients (1.6%; median survival, 4 months). Patients with Stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis had a median survival of 9.1 months, while patients with a delayed occurrence of distant metastases had a median survival of only 4 months from the time of diagnosis of the distant metastases. Significant risk factors for distant metastases were malignant ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, large metastatic disease within the abdomen, and retroperitoneal lymph node involvement at the time of the initial surgery. The significance of positive retroperitoneal nodes and bulky upper abdominal disease has important therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".U": "87301291\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the cellular differentiation of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC), a comparative immunohistochemical study of 12 normal salivary glands and eight specimens of ACC was performed. Antibodies were used against S100 protein (S), keratins (K) of various molecular weights, vimentin (V), muscle-specific actin (A), epithelial-membrane antigen, human milk fat globules, and collagen type IV. A panel of four of these antibodies (SKVA) was identified as the most helpful in characterizing cells in normal salivary glands and ACC. The immunophenotypes depended on the histologic patterns of ACC. Cells in morphologically recognizable duct structures in the cribriform and trabecular areas expressed a phenotype similar to that of the intercalated duct. Cell layers around pseudocysts and occasional cellular islands had an immunophenotype suggesting myoepithelial-cell differentiation. The most clear cut epithelial/myoepithelial bilaminar differentiation was present in areas with a trabecular pattern, in which the layers facing the stroma and the central ductal elements had SKVA phenotypes of myoepithelial and ductal differentiation, respectively. In areas with a reticular pattern, most of the cells showed ductal differentiation. Many of the cells in the cribriform and basaloid regions were immunophenotypically undifferentiated. These results indicate that ACC consists of undifferentiated cells and of cells that are differentiating toward ducts, predominantly intercalated ducts, and toward myoepithelium. These findings support previous observations by electron microscope.\r"

In 159 of the 220 patients, an index neoplasm was present in the rectosigmoid region. Of these 159 patients, 32 had an index rectosigmoid adenoma less than 5 mm in diameter (diminutive), 105 had an index rectosigmoid adenoma greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter and 22 had an index rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Among these patients with different index neoplasms the frequency of synchronous neoplasms was 34%, 53%, and 73%, respectively. The synchronous neoplasm was an adenoma greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter in 13%, 40%, and 64%, respectively. The synchronous neoplasm was a carcinoma in 0%, 7%, and 5%, respectively. Two or more synchronous neoplasms occurred in 9%, 34%, and 41% of the index neoplasm groups, respectively. Finally, symptoms providing an indication for colonoscopy were present in 31%, 75%, and 86%, respectively. It is concluded that patients with diminutive index adenomas had fewer and smaller synchronous neoplasms (P less than 0.025) than patients with larger adenomas or invasive carcinoma as the index lesion. Thus, total colonoscopy does not appear to be necessary in asymptomatic patients with only diminutive adenomas found at flexible sigmoidoscopy.\r"

The 5-year actuarial survival rate is 29.8%. Three patients are now alive and well 6 years and 9 months, 5 years and 10 months, and 5 years and 5 months after the operation. One additional patient who underwent resection in an affiliated hospital has done well for 8 years and 8 months. The results from these four patients treated by curative resection support a strategy featuring curative resection with aggressive surgery.\r"

Eighty percent of the breast cancer patients with primary hyperparathyroidism had earlier stage disease (Stage 0, Stage 1, Stage 2); whereas 97% of the patients with breast cancer and hypercalcemia (not due to 1 degree HPT) had advanced disease.

This is a report of the development and standardization of such a scale. The play-performance scale for children is a parent-rated instrument which records usual play activity as the index of performance. Performance status ratings were obtained on three groups of children: patients (n = 98), patients' siblings (n = 29), and an independent sample of hospital employees' children (n = 40). Children with all types and stages of childhood malignant neoplasms were represented. Test results established the parent as a competent, reliable rater and demonstrated the validity of the scale. Interrater reliability was examined using correlational statistics and percentage agreement. Agreement between parents was good, and there were no systematic rater biases. In addition, parents' ratings significantly discriminated differences in levels of functioning (mean score, patients 75.4 versus siblings 97.4). Correlational and analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures demonstrated that the play-performance scale was significantly related to the global performance measures of experienced clinicians and was sensitive to change. Inpatients received a mean score of 42.3, outpatients 90.7, and normals 98.2. These findings indicate that the scale is both feasible and effective. It is concise, can be administered repeatedly even to extremely ill patients, and uses parents as observer reporters. The play-performance scale for children provides quantifiable, reproducible, and meaningful data, which is necessary for effective monitoring and management of the child with cancer.\r"

Patients were studied at the time of entry onto one of three Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols: 7781 (N = 165) and 8083 (N = 139) for limited disease; and 7782 (N = 151) for extensive disease. Besides ED (limited versus extensive), a four-point rating of PSR was obtained. Psychological distress was measured by the standardized Profile of Mood States (POMS). Gender, age, marital status, education, PSR, ED and two relevant interaction terms (PSR X ED; gender X ED) were analyzed using multiple linear and hierarchical regressions. Of the six main variables, gender and PSR had significant association with POMS total mood disturbance, a summary score for POMS emotional subscales, and most of the individual subscales. The PSR X ED interaction provided a rationale for testing a new regression model in which PSR and ED were combined into a single index of impairment. The final index resulted in five levels of physical impairment which bear an approximately linear relationship to increasing levels of distress (Overall regression, P less than 0.001). These data suggest that PSR is an important factor in modelling POMS distress at both levels of ED, and that ED becomes an important factor with poorer performance status only.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 533 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 4-h duration were enrolled in the multicenter randomized trial of intracoronary thrombolysis compared to conventional treatment. In two of the five participating centers, an additional coronary angioplasty immediately after thrombolysis was attempted in 46 patients. According to the treatment allocation and early and late patency of the infarct related vessel, patients were subdivided into three groups: conventionally treated (group A); successful coronary angioplasty following thrombolysis with persistent patent infarct related vessel (group B); and late patency of the infarct related vessel postthrombolytic therapy without angioplasty (group C). The highest global ejection fractions were observed in group B (54% +/- 10%) and group C (55% +/- 13%), while the lowest ejection fraction was found in group A (47% +/- 14%). The sequential changes in global ejection fraction from the acute to the chronic stage was + 4% (p = 0.05) in group B, while no significant changes could be demonstrated in group C. Furthermore, in the group successfully treated by angioplasty, the improvement in global ejection fraction was more pronounced and persisted up to three months after the intervention. This was supported by analysis of regional myocardial function of the infarct zone (+ 16% improvement, p = 0.01). The long-term clinical follow-up (median 24 months) of the patients successfully treated by combined procedure of thrombolysis and angioplasty (group B) was most favourable with a lower incidence of re-infarction (6%), and late coronary bypass surgery (13%) and/or (re)-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (3%) was performed less frequently. These results suggest that reperfusion may need to be supplemented by additional revascularization procedures in order to optimize the changes of obtaining full functional recovery and so to improve the prognosis.\r"

Reviewing the last 250 consecutive transseptal heart catheterizations between 1978 and 1986, the left atrium and ventricle were entered in all but six patients. One death occurred with four other major complications. There were 177 males and 73 females ranging from 18 to 84 years of age. Of these 250 studies, 31 were in association with direct left ventricular apical puncture; 42 were in patients with subaortic stenosis; 101 were in aortic stenosis; 26 were in patients with combined aortic and mitral disease; and four were in patients with triple prosthetic valve replacements. No attempts were made to cross the prosthetic mitral valves. A decline in the number of transseptal studies at this institution has been noted over the past 8 years and the technique is not longer taught routinely to Fellows. The reduction is due to increased emphasis on coronary artery anatomy, fewer rheumatic and prosthetic valvular admissions, and improved reevaluation by non-invasive echocardiography and doppler studies. This has resulted in a loss in proficiency among invasive cardiologists. In conclusion, the transseptal technique is potentially hazardous, but continued usage will maintain proficiency and a low major and minor complication rate.\r"

Stenoses were judged more severe by visual estimate in 11 segments. Seven of twelve segments had significant differences between readers using the visual estimate, but no significant differences were obtained using caliper measurements. Variability was highest for fellows using the visual method. Interobserver agreement was highest using the digital caliper and the 70% criteria. Intraobserver agreement was most dependent on the amount of time taken in film interpretation. The digital caliper appears to be preferable in interpreting angiograms, particularly for cardiology fellows.\r"

In the absence of these factors, only a subgroup of patients who had greater than 75% luminal obstruction of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) demonstrated DF abnormalities. Using 60 frames/sec biplane contrast ventriculography, we evaluated the left ventricular filling curve and its derivative in 21 patients with normal coronary arteries and NLVF (group 1), 17 CD patients with NLVF and no LAD disease (group 2), and 18 patients with LAD disease and NLVF (group 3). The peak filling rate (PFR) as end diastolic volumes/sec (EDV/S) was reduced in group 3 patients (group 3: 3.00 +/- 0.51 EDV/S vs group 1: 3.59 +/- 0.84 EDV/S, p less than .05; and group 2: 3.61 +/- 0.91 EDV/S, p less than .05). There was marked overlap in the PFR's between the normal and LAD group. DF may be normal in CD patients with NLVF in the absence of LAD disease.

As a consequence the patient died of irreversible left heart failure before an operation could be performed. Consequently passing a tilting disc valve can no longer be considered as completely safe. This procedure should only be used under exceptional circumstances requiring very strict indication. If such an intervention is necessary, then it should only be performed by experienced cardiologists, who should take all possible precautions to reduce risks.\r"

The detection of ST segment deviation during the procedure is important for decisions regarding guiding catheter seating and the timing of balloon inflation and deflation. ST segment deviation appears on intracoronary electrograms in the absence of changes on the surface ECG in many patients, while the reverse is true in some individuals. When a precordial lead is employed, V5 or V6 is most commonly selected. The surface ECG leads most sensitive for monitoring ischemia during left anterior descending angioplasty are not known. In nine lead surface ECGs recorded during balloon inflation, a small degree of ST segment elevation occurred in leads I, aVL, and V5. Lead V2 demonstrated an increase in ST displacement from 0.0 +/- 0.03 mV to 0.29 +/- 0.25 mV during coronary occlusion (p less than 0.01). We conclude that if V5 or V6 is used as a single precordial lead, surface ECG alterations are easily overlooked. During left anterior descending occlusion the most sensitive surface lead is V2. Optimal ECG monitoring during PTCA in some cases should involve surface lead V2 or the intracoronary lead.\r"

It is concluded that the use of the Superflow (5F) catheter confers no advantage, while it is associated with longer screening time and poorer left ventriculograms.\r"

This study was performed to compare the efficacy of the lateral (LAT) projection to conventional angiographic views for right coronary artery (RCA) evaluation pre- and post-PTCA. In 45 consecutive patients undergoing PTCA of 56 RCA lesions, the LAT was available to evaluate 40 lesions pre- and 44 lesions post-PTCA. Angiographic comparison of the LAT versus standard LAO, LAO cranial, and RAO views were performed by two experienced angiographers with consensus reading. The LAT was the best projection for assessing lesion morphology pre-PTCA in 19/40 (48%) and in 19/44 (43%) post-PTCA, while the LAT was significantly better (P less than or equal to 0.01) than standard views for assessing side branch orientation (48/56, 86%) and post-PTCA intimal disruption (18/33, 55%). In addition, LAT was the best view for assessing mid RCA lesions 13/21 (62%) pre-PTCA and 12/27 (44%) post-PTCA, while post-PTCA intimal disruption was best detected by LAT in 14/24 (58%). Lesions only recognized in the LAT view occurred in five instances, four involving right ventricular branch ostia and one involving the proximal posterior descending. Thus, the LAT projection appears helpful during PTCA to assess lesion morphology, eccentricity, side branch orientation, and intimal disruption pre- and post-PTCA as an adjunct to conventional views.\r"

However, the potential role of DADs in the genesis of ischemic arrhythmias is not clear. We studied the effects of different components of severe ischemia (acidosis, hypoxia, lactate, increased potassium, and the absence of glucose) on DADs. DADs were evoked using trains of 30-60 externally applied pulses at a rate of 4-5 Hz in the presence of isoproterenol (10(-7) M) or dibutyryl cyclic 3', 5' adenosine monophosphate (dB-cAMP, 10(-3) M). Acidosis, caused by the addition of protons (pH = 6.8), increased the amplitude of DADs from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.9 +/- 0.5 mV (n = 8, p less than 0.001). DADs were abolished by hypoxia (pO2 less than 35 mm Hg, n = 7, p less than 0.001) from control values of 3.4 +/- 0.3 mV. DADs were also abolished by neutral lactate (20 mM, n = 7, p less than 0.001) in the absence of glucose. Acidotic lactate (20 mM, pH0 = 6.8), however, was unable to abolish DADs. Increasing the extracellular potassium concentration to 16.2 mM decreased DAD amplitude from 3.6 +/- 0.27 mV to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mV (n = 5, p less than 0.002) with an associated reduction of membrane potential from -86.2 +/- 0.9 to -58.6 +/- 0.9 mV. The overall effect of simulated ischemia (all components tested together) was to abolish DADs (n = 8, p less than 0.001), with hypoxia as the most important factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if the functional border zone can be modified by pharmacologic interventions that alter contractility, we infused isoproterenol (0.04-0.10 micrograms/kg/min) or administered propranolol (2 mg/kg) during circumflex coronary occlusion in nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs. We measured systolic wall thickening on both sides of the perfusion boundary, which was delineated with myocardial blood flow (microsphere) maps constructed from small tissue samples. By fitting sigmoid curves to the composite systolic wall thickening data after coronary occlusion, we modeled the distribution of functional impairment across the perfusion boundary. Defined as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97.5% of the nonischemic asymptote of the sigmoid fits, the functional border zone was 31 degrees of circumference after coronary occlusion alone. Isoproterenol increased +dP/dt by 58% and augmented nonischemic systolic wall thickening without changing the lateral extent of the functional border zone (32 degrees). Propranolol reduced +dP/dt by 24% and depressed nonischemic systolic wall thickening, but the size of the functional border zone remained limited to 28 degrees. Within the functional border zone, wall thickening was significantly but only moderately reduced (-28%) compared with thickening in nonischemic myocardium more than 10 mm away from the perfusion boundary. The ratio of nonischemic border zone to central nonischemic area wall thickening remained the same with each intervention. We conclude that the dimensions of the functional border zone are fixed early after coronary occlusion and that inotropic interventions do not modify the extent or relative severity of nonischemic regional dysfunction.\r"

The vessels from the hypertensives had a 29% increase in the media-thickness-to-lumen-diameter ratio. The maximal force development to noradrenaline (NA) expressed as active pressure (an estimate of the pressure the vessels could have contracted against in vivo) was 30% higher in vessels from the hypertensives, while active media stress (force per square unit of smooth muscle) and sensitivity to NA was not significantly different. Increased active pressure, as well as unaltered active media stress and sensitivity, was seen for vasopressin, serotonin, angiotensin II, and K+. There was, however, an enhanced leftward shift of the NA sensitivity with cocaine (an inhibitor of the neuronal amine pump) in vessels from the hypertensives [pD2(+cocaine) and pD2(-cocaine) were 0.185 +/- 0.53) and 0.040 +/- 0.044, hypertensives and normotensives, respectively, p less than 0.05] suggesting an abnormality of presynaptic function in essential hypertension. Furthermore, the calcium sensitivity was depressed (pD2 was 4.197 +/- 0.050 and 4.381 +/- 0.068, hypertensives and normotensives, respectively, p less than 0.05), and the rate of relaxation was faster (p less than 0.05) in vessels from hypertensives, suggesting that excitation-contraction coupling might be depressed. The results suggest that the increased pressor response in essential hypertension can, to a large extent, be explained by altered vascular structure, while smooth muscle function is either unchanged or possibly depressed.\r"

Blood flow increased (220 or 130% of control) with the serosal application of 10(-6) M N-ethyl carboxamido adenosine (NECA, A2-selective agonist) or 2-chloro adenosine (2CA, nonselective agonist) but not with cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA, A1-selective agonist). The nonselective competitive antagonist, 8-phenyl theophylline, attenuated the response evoked by NECA. The mucosal application of 10(-6) M CHA caused blood flow decreases (81% of control), but neither NECA nor 2CA evoked a response. These observations suggest a mucosal diffusion barrier, so the concentrations of the analogues were raised one hundredfold. Serosal 10(-4) M CHA or NECA caused blood flow increases, but the effects were negligible with mucosal application, suggesting that the mucosa was indeed impermeable to these compounds. The responses evoked by 10(-4) M 2CA were similar on the serosa or mucosa (200-220% of control), submaximal (maximum = 400% of control at 10(-3) M), and not antagonized by 8-phenyl theophylline or by the cellular uptake inhibitor, nitrobenzyl-6-thio guanosine. In context with earlier studies, greater than 10(-6) M 2CA probably evokes vasodilation that is not entirely mediated by extracellular receptors. Serosal adenosine (10(-4) M) caused submaximal blood flow increases (200% of control) that were not potentiated by nitrobenzyl-6-thio guanosine or another transport inhibitor, dipyridamole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Blood flow studies were conducted in neurolept anesthetized dogs to characterize the involvement of renal nerves in ipsilateral renal vasoconstriction seen during acute elevation of renal venous pressure above 30 mm Hg. Renal blood flow was measured electromagnetically. The vasoconstrictor response was almost abolished by acute surgical denervation of the kidney, since renal vascular conductance remained unchanged during renal venous pressure elevation from 30-60 mm Hg. However, following additional alpha-adrenoceptor blockade or chronic renal denervation, renal vascular conductance increased progressively during renal venous pressure elevation to 60 mm Hg. The effect of acute decapsulation of kidney was studied in another group of dogs. Decapsulation induced a vasoconstriction. The decrease in renal vascular conductance observed during renal venous pressure elevation was unaffected by acute surgical denervation of decapsulated kidney, but was almost abolished following additional alpha-adrenoceptor blockade or chronic denervation. In decapsulated chronically denervated kidney, the increase in renal vascular conductance during renal venous pressure elevation to 60 mm Hg was still present but considerably attenuated as compared with the chronically denervated kidney with intact capsule. The renin-angiotensin system did not participate in acute vascular adjustments to renal venous stasis in intact kidney or in decapsulated acutely surgically denervated kidney. The data favor the view that neurogenic and myogenic mechanisms significantly influence the vasoconstrictor response to renal venous pressure elevation in dog kidney. The neurogenic contribution to the vasoconstrictor response comprises intrarenal and extrarenal vasoconstrictor mechanisms evoked reflexively by renal venous pressure elevation, and the myogenic contribution to the vasoconstrictor response comprises opposing vasodilator mechanisms due to increase in renal interstitial tissue pressure during renal venous pressure elevation.\r"

Myocardial microvascular permeability has been estimated by determining the filtration independent reflection coefficient for beta-lipoprotein (sigma beta-LIPO). This technique requires the measurement of myocardial lymph flow rate and the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio. Unfortunately, it is a nonsurvival procedure. An index of myocardial microvascular permeability was needed that could be determined in experimental preparations without sacrificing valuable chronically instrumented animals. We attempted to relate changes in myocardial microvascular permeability and myocardial edema formation to some index of myocardial performance. In 33 acute, anesthetized dogs (with normal or disrupted myocardial microvasculatures), we measured systemic arterial pressure, systemic venous pressure, coronary sinus pressure, left ventricular pressure, the maximum rate of change in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt)max, myocardial lymph flow rate, and myocardial extravascular fluid volume. Following an increase in coronary sinus pressure, the amount of edema fluid entering the myocardium varied as a function of myocardial microvascular permeability. Further, as the heart became edematous, (dP/dt)max changed with respect to time [delta(dP/dt)max/delta t]. Finally, a significant relation was found between sigma beta-LIPO and delta(dP/dt)max/delta t. Since coronary sinus pressure can be elevated and delta(dP/dt)max/delta t can be measured in chronic animals, this technique may be useful for evaluating myocardial microvascular permeability on a long-term survival basis.\r"

A physiologic after-loading system for the low-pressure atrium was created by coupling it to a real-time computer-simulated ventricle and a simulated venous impedance network via a volume servo-pump. In 10 atria loaded with such systems, multiple isochronal sets of pressure-volume data were collected from many ejecting or isovolumic contractions obtained under a constant inotropic state, and the time-varying elastance, E(t), as well as the volume-axis intercepts, VO(t), were calculated. E(t) is the ensemble of slopes, and VO(t), the volume-axis intercepts resulting from the linear regression of instantaneous pressure on instantaneous volume at multiple instants throughout the cardiac cycle. The systolic portion of the left atrial E(t) was insensitive to loading conditions, as was VO(t), which, in addition, proved to be similar to the right atrial and right ventricular VO(t) waveforms in its time dependence. These results indicate that E(t) and VO(t) adequately represent the instantaneous pressure-volume relation of the left atrium in systole irrespective of the mode of contraction. Whatever the underlying mechanism might be, the load insensitivity and similarity of the basic shape of the left atrial E(t) among different atria suggests that the characterization reflects fundamental features of left atrial contraction.\r"

Peak measured intraventricular pressure gradients were attained very early in ejection, amounted to 6.7 +/- 1.9 (SD) mm Hg at rest, and were intensified to 13.0 +/- 2.3 mm Hg during submaximal supine bicycle exercise. The augmentation of the gradients during exercise was associated with a pronounced accentuation of the flow acceleration and flow at the instant of peak gradient. A peak flow, the intraventricular gradients amounted to 5.4 +/- 1.7 mm Hg at rest and 10.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg during submaximal exercise. The exercise-induced enhancement of the measured intraventricular pressure difference at the time of peak flow was underlain by an accentuation of the peak flow itself. A semiempirical fluid dynamic model for ejection was applied to the pressure gradient and simultaneous outflow rate and acceleration data to identify the contributions by local and convective acceleration effects to the instantaneous intraventricular gradient values. The peak intraventricular pressure gradient, which is attained very early in ejection, is mostly accounted for by local acceleration effects (85 +/- 5% of the total). Conversely, at peak flow only convective acceleration effects are responsible for the measured pressure gradient. Thus, when inertial effects are augmented, as in exercise and other hyperdynamic states, the intrinsic component of the total left ventricular systolic load can be substantial, even with no outflow tract or valve abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vascular resistance in the pulmonary arteries, microvessels, and veins was determined by micropuncture measurement of microvascular pressures, and regional distribution of blood flow in the lungs was determined using radiolabelled microspheres both before and after the development of varying degrees of hydrostatic edema. Edema was induced by raising venous pressure. During measurements, alveolar and venous pressures were kept constant at 7 and 8 cm H2O, respectively, as well as lung blood flow (540 +/- 107 ml/min). All vascular pressures were referenced to the superior surface of the lung, site of all micropunctures. Active vasomotor changes were eliminated by addition of papaverine to the perfusate. Under baseline nonedematous conditions in the absence of vasomotor tone, 17% of the total pressure drop was in arteries, 41% was in microvessels, and 42% was in veins. With the development of alveolar edema (80 +/- 13% weight gain), there was no change in total or segmental vascular resistance, but after 148 +/- 97% weight gain, total pulmonary vascular resistance increased by 74%. Segmental pressure drop increased in arteries by 172% and in microvessels by 132% but decreased by 22% in the venous segment. Regional distribution of blood flow remained unchanged. Possible mechanisms for increased resistance to blood flow may be compression of small arterioles and venules (less than 20 micron diameter) by liquid cuffs and/or occlusion of microvessels by the weight of alveolar liquid.\r"

  ".W": "Quinidine is the most commonly used drug for the chronic treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, but it may be arrhythmogenic. Much information exists concerning quinidine's effects on active properties in cardiac tissues, but virtually nothing is known of its effects on passive properties. We studied the effects of quinidine, in a clinically relevant concentration, on the balance among active and passive cellular properties that comprise the electrophysiologic matrix that determines cardiac excitability. The multiple microelectrode method of intracellular-current application and transmembrane voltage recording was used in sheep Purkinje fibers to determine strength-duration and constant current-voltage relations as well as cable properties. A rapid, on-line computerized data analysis system tracked in time the alterations in the active and passive properties relevant to excitability. In normal fibers at [K+]o = 5.4 mM, quinidine increased cardiac excitability as manifested by a decrease in the current required to attain threshold and/or a downward shift in strength- and charge-duration relations by altering passive properties despite a depressed sodium system and a slowed conduction velocity. During washout, excitability and passive properties remained altered despite a return of descriptive action potential parameters such as the resting potential, the maximum rate of rise of phase 0, overshoot, and the action potential duration to or nearly to normal. At [K+]o = 8.0 mM, quinidine could either increase or decrease excitability; net excitability depends on the balance between altered passive properties and the depressed sodium system. The results explain, in part, the antiarrhythmic actions and arrhythmogenic potential of quinidine. The data for quinidine and other antiarrhythmic drugs are interpreted in terms of the electrophysiologic matrix, which we believe has important advantages over traditional hierarchical classifications.\r"

Cable analysis was made possible by placing the muscle in a H2O-saturated gaseous environment, which acted as an electrical insulator. Ischemia was produced by exchanging the O2 in the atmosphere by N2 (94% N2-6% CO2) in addition to arresting coronary flow. The first 10-15 minutes of ischemia were characterized by an increase in ro, while ri remained constant. The early part of the increase in ro coincided with the drop in perfusion pressure and was probably due to the diminution of intravascular volume. Rapid electrical uncoupling, reflected by an increase in ri (threefold within 5 minutes), occurred thereafter. The dissociation between the early increase in ro and the delayed increase in ri produced an initial increase in the ratio ro:ri, which subsequently decreased. The decrease in conduction velocity was less than observed in intact hearts with ischemia. This difference is explained by the relatively small changes in resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude in the preparation used. Our results suggest that in the early, reversible phase of ischemia, the increase in ro contributes to a small but significant extent to the slowing of conduction. After 15-20 minutes, the rapid cellular uncoupling, which was most likely coincident with breakdown of cellular homeostasis, may contribute to the occurrence of arrhythmias during this phase of ischemia. Moreover, the early change in the ratio ro:ri will influence the amplitude of the extracellular electrograms following coronary occlusion (TQ-segment and ST-segment shifts).\r"

In particular, it is not clear whether heparin prevents exit of quiescent SMC from the resting state, inhibits progression through the prereplicative (G1) sequence, or acts during DNA synthesis itself. In this study, induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was used as a marker of SMC entry into the cell cycle in an attempt to localize the site of heparin action during the initial hours after rat carotid injury. Rapid and transient induction of ODC activity was observed that reached a maximum (twenty-three-fold) 6 hours after wounding. Heparin failed to prevent ODC induction but greatly reduced frequencies of [3H]thymidine-labelled SMC nuclei 33 hours after injury. Moreover, heparin infusion could be delayed for up to 18 hours after the injury event with no significant loss of antiproliferative effect. Further delays resulted in marked loss of growth inhibition. The results of these studies show that SMC rapidly and synchronously leave the resting state after injury and suggest that heparin acts late in the prereplicative (G1) sequence or early in S phase to inhibit SMC proliferation in damaged arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Pretreatment of the ischemic myocardium with verapamil protects against mitochondrial respiratory depression observed during ischemic arrest as well as during reperfusion. Since ischemic mitochondrial function appears not to be altered further by reperfusion, the purpose of this study is to identify a biochemical event affecting mitochondria that is specifically associated with reperfusion injury. It has been proposed that increased cellular Ca2+ influx and oxygen toxicity may result from reintroduction of coronary flow. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ is transmitted to the mitochondria with subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent events, including phospholipase A2. Net production of lysophospholipids (and loss of total diacylphospholipids from the mitochondria) will proceed when reacylation mechanisms are inhibited. Since acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase is a sulfhydryl-sensitive enzyme and since increased activity of glutathione peroxidase shifts the levels of the mitochondrial sulfhydryl buffer, glutathione, towards oxidation, levels of glutathione and its oxidation state were measured during reperfusion in the absence or presence of verapamil pretreatment. Ischemia lowers total glutathione and reduces the redox ratio (reduced glutathione: oxidized glutathione) by 85%. Reperfusion partially returns the redox ratio to control by causing oxidized glutathione to disappear from the matrix. Verapamil maintains both the concentration and the redox potential of glutathione at control levels. Concomitant with alterations in reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione is a decrease in ischemic mitochondrial phospholipid content. During reperfusion, phosphatidylethanolamine and its major constituent fatty acids (C 18:0 and C 20:4) are specifically lost from the mitochondrial membrane. Accompanying the significant loss of arachidonic acid during reperfusion is the decreased content of 11-OH, 12-OH, and 15-OH arachidonate. These lipid peroxidation products are not increased in ischemia. It is proposed that oxidation of matrix glutathione to glutathione disulfide during ischemia results in formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and inhibition of sulfhydryl-sensitive proteins, including acyl-CoA lysophosphatide acyltransferase. Thus, metabolic events occurring within the ischemic period set the stage for prolonged dysfunction during reperfusion.\r"

This model of moderate ARF is characterized by a parallel fall in glomerular filtration rate (delta GFR, -43%) and renal blood flow (delta RBF, -38%) within the first three hours after HgCl2 administration. Glomerular hemodynamics were studied by analysis of PVP-sieving curves. There was a significant shift of these curves upward and to the right during the 3 hours that followed the injection of HgCl2. From this analysis, no arguments for tubular back-leak could be found. Mathematical analysis of the curves revealed a fall in effective filtration pressure (EFP) in presence of an unchanged glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) (delta EFP, -40 +/- 4%; p less than 0.01; delta Kf, +5 +/- 1%; p greater than 0.05 vs. control). No major changes occurred in glomerular colloid osmotic pressure. Subsequently, the early fall of GFR in this toxic model of acute renal failure was essentially attributed to a decrease of effective filtration pressure due to either tubular obstruction and/or mainly to renal hemodynamic changes.\r"

However, in isolated muscle preparations, there are experimental data based on both mechanical and energetic measurements that suggest that the pressure-volume area concept may not obtain. In the present study, force-length area, the analog of pressure-volume area for a linear muscle, was examined in the ferret papillary muscle preparation under a wide range of loading conditions. There were two major findings: first, force-length area is closely correlated with oxygen consumption (r = 0.94-0.98); this correlation is better than those for such other indexes as peak force and force-time integral. Furthermore, this relation of oxygen consumption with force-length area is independent of the mode of contraction (isometric or shortening), while the relations with the other indexes are not. Second, quick release imposed after end-systole during isometric contraction was found to curtail oxygen consumption. The first finding, the optimal correlation of force-length area with oxygen consumption, suggests both that the correlation of pressure-volume area with oxygen consumption on the ventricular level arises from a basic property of cardiac muscle and that force-length area may be the best mechanical index to use in calculating regional oxygen consumption for a ventricular segment. The second finding, however, suggests that the time-varying elastance model, on which the concepts of pressure-volume area and force-length area are based, may not provide a complete description of the mechanical basis of cardiac muscle energetics, especially during the isometric contraction.\r"

In addition, the conduction system of 2 human adult hearts was studied. The fetal atrium is composed mostly of alpha-MHC during the first 23 weeks of gestation. beta-MHC is already expressed as traces at 14 weeks of gestation, and its expression increases progressively until birth, resulting in a great augmentation in beta-MHC. During this course, beta-MHC always predominates in certain areas (the crista terminalis and the interatrial septum) but not in other areas (the auricles). Preceding birth, the fetal ventricle is composed mostly of beta-MHC. From 14 weeks of gestation to birth, alpha-MHC is expressed in very rare fibers. Then, after birth, a large number of fibers simultaneously synthesize alpha-MHC. The AV node and His bundle system were labelled with anti-alpha and anti-beta Mab in fetal, newborn, and adult hearts with a double gradient of distribution: spatial (a higher proportion of alpha-containing fibers in the AV node than in the distal portion of the bundle of branches) and temporal (a higher proportion of alpha-containing fibers at a given point in fetal development than in the adult heart). One of the twenty-five hearts studied had an isomyosin distribution pattern not accorded to its age. Interestingly, it was clinically diagnosed as having idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

Aortic constriction was created so that aortic cross-sectional areas would be the same for the 3 groups of rats. Four weeks after imposition of aortic constriction, there was no significant difference in peak LV pressure, peak-to-peak and mean systolic pressure gradients between left ventricle and aorta, cardiac output, LV minute work, or cross-sectional area of the aortic constrictions in the 3 groups. In 9-month-old aortic-constricted rats, LV dry wt (LVDW)/body wt, LVDW/tibial length, and myocyte width increased by 23% (p less than 0.01), 14% (p less than 0.01), and 27% (p less than 0.01), respectively, compared with sham-operated rats. In contrast, in 18-month-old and 22-month-old aortic-constricted rats, LVDW/body wt and LVDW/tibial length were unchanged compared with sham-operated controls, and increases in myocyte width were only modest 4 weeks following constriction. RNA concentration in the myocardium 5 days after constriction increased by 21% (p less than 0.001) in 9-month-old rats but showed no significant rise in 18-month-old rats. These results suggest that advancing age is associated with a diminished capacity to develop myocardial hypertrophy in response to acute pressure overload and that a reduced ability to synthesize protein may be one of the major contributing factors to a diminished capacity for hypertrophy in advanced age.\r"

  ".W": "Diet-induced atherosclerosis in primates impairs vasodilator responses and greatly potentiates vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin. Serotonin may play an important role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm. In diet-induced regression of atherosclerosis, intimal lesions are reduced, but maximal vasodilator responses do not improve, perhaps because of vascular fibrosis. Our goal was to determine whether dietary treatment of atherosclerosis reverses the augmented vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin and thus might reduce susceptibility to vasospasm. Normal cynomolgus monkeys, atherosclerotic monkeys, and atherosclerotic monkeys that were given a normal (regression) diet for 18 months were studied. Morphometric studies indicated that the regression diet reduced lesions in the iliac and femoral artery since intimal area was reduced by about 50%. In the hind limb perfused at constant flow, residual resistance during maximal vasodilatation produced by infusion of adenosine tended to be greater in atherosclerotic monkeys than in normals and failed to improve in regression monkeys. In contrast, vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin were greatly potentiated in atherosclerotic monkeys and were restored to normal in regression monkeys. Serotonin (20 micrograms i.a.) decreased hind limb resistance (in mm Hg/ml/min) 0.34 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SE) in normal monkeys, increased resistance 0.58 +/- 0.17 in atherosclerotic monkeys (p less than 0.05 vs. normal), and decreased resistance 0.70 +/- 0.15 in regression monkeys (p less than 0.05 vs. atherosclerotic). Thus, dietary treatment of atherosclerosis abolishes augmented vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin. It is proposed that treatment of atherosclerosis may be beneficial, even when vasodilator responses fail to improve, by reducing susceptibility to serotonin-induced vasospasm.\r"

In the chloralose-anesthetized cat, during normal sinus rhythm prior to ischemia, ventricular activation was rapid with a total activation time of 25 +/- 2 msec. Five minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, activation was delayed during sinus rhythm (64 +/- 6 msec) (p less than 0.001 vs. control) and was characterized by slow conduction in the same plane and block in both the same plane and in the endocardial-to-epicardial direction. In 76% of cases (16 of 21), initiation of single PVCs and the first beat of VT occurred through intramural reentry. In all but one case, initiation occurred in the subendocardium, adjacent to the site of delayed subendocardial and midmyocardial activation of the preceding sinus beat. The activation time of the sinus beat preceding the PVC or VT was significantly prolonged (149 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.001 vs. sinus beats during ischemia not followed by a PVC or VT) with most of the delayed activity occurring in the subendocardium and midmyocardium, a finding that would not have been apparent by epicardial mapping alone. The length of the reentrant pathway ranged from 1.8-3.0 cm. Marked delay was a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for reentry to occur since, in some cases, delays as large as 220 msec was found without initiation of reentry or the occurrence of nonreentrant PVCs or VT. Maintenance of VT by intramural reentry arose in either the subendocardium or the subepicardium and was primarily dependent on the continued presence of marked transmural delay (159 +/- 8 msec). In contrast, in 24% of cases (5 of 21), initiation of the first beat of VT arose in either the subendocardium or subepicardium by a mechanism other than reentry as evidenced by the lack of intervening electrical activity between the end of the preceding sinus beat and the initiation of the ectopic beat. The preceding sinus beat was characterized by delay (129 +/- 12 msec) comparable to that of sinus beats preceding reentrant ectopic beats (p = NS), but the marked delay was distant from the site of nonreentrant initiation. Ventricular tachycardia could be initiated by one mechanism (reentrant or nonreentrant) and maintained or terminated by another mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The binding characteristics of 6 pure stereoisomers, (-) and (+)202-791, (-) and (+)Bay k 8644, (-) and (+)PN 200-110, as well as racemic Bay k 8644 and nitrendipine, were compared. Competition studies using the cold ligands and 3 different radiolabelled dihydropyridines, (+)[3H]PN 200-110, (+/-)[3H]nitrendipine, and (+/-)[3H]Bay k 8644, showed that, for each combination tested, the labelled dihydropyridine could be displaced by the cold dihydropyridine. The binding reactions were markedly affected by temperature. The Kd values for most compounds were significantly higher (5-19 times) at 0 degrees than at 37 degrees C. In contrast, the affinity of (+)PN 200-110 was similar at 0 degrees and 37 degrees C, but slightly higher at 25 degrees C. A thermodynamic analysis indicated that the binding of the two pure isomers that are Ca2+-channel activators (\"agonists\"), (-)Bay k 8644 and (+)202-791, was driven entirely by enthalpy and was associated with an unfavorable decrease in entropy. This was in marked contrast to the binding of the inhibitors (\"antagonists\"). The binding of (+)PN 200-110 and nitrendipine at low temperatures was driven largely or entirely by entropy. Other antagonist-binding reactions were driven mainly by enthalpy but were associated with favorable increases in entropy. The affinity of the three radiolabelled ligands for the dihydropyridine receptor differed 100 times and appeared to be due to large differences in dissociation rate constants for each of the ligands. The rates of dissociation of (+)[3H]PN 200-110 and (+/-)[3H]nitrendipine, but not of (+/-)[3H]Bay k 8644, were significantly slowed by diltiazem, a calcium-channel inhibitor that binds to another receptor on the calcium channel. The results show that there were marked differences in the binding of the various dihydropyridines and suggest that the energetics of binding of Ca2+-channel activators and inhibitors may be fundamentally different.\r"

After treatment, the animals were killed and their hearts perfused by the isolated working technique. Mechanical performance (as indicated by the double product of heart rate and left ventricular [LV] peak systolic pressure) of both carnitine-treated cardiomyopathic groups was increased significantly above their respective sham-treated groups. Associated with these increases in mechanical performance were significant increases in both peak-positive LV dP/dt (index of contractility) and peak negative dP/dt (index of relaxation) in both carnitine-treated myopathic groups. Serum carnitine levels were increased 10-15 times within 2 hours after injection of L-carnitine in all 3 groups. Myocardial free-carnitine levels were increased twofold in both control and dilated myopathic hearts above their respective sham-treated groups, restoring the level in the dilated hearts comparable to those of controls. Myocardial carnitine levels in the hypertrophic group were not significantly affected by treatment. Total high-energy phosphate stores, i.e., ATP plus creatine phosphate, were restored to control levels by L-carnitine treatment in both cardiomyopathic groups. Levels of the breakdown products of ATP were maintained primarily in the more readily convertible adenosine diphosphate and adenosine monophosphate forms in all three treated groups. These changes resulted in significantly higher ratios of (ATP)/(ADP + AMP + adenosine) and (creatine phosphate)/(creatine) in the treated hearts. This is the first study demonstrating that high-dose L-carnitine treatment results in improved cardiac performance and increased myocardial total high-energy phosphate stores in the Syrian hamster model with one of two distinct forms of cardiomyopathy, i.e., dilated or hypertrophic. The mechanisms for these effects of exogenous L-carnitine treatment cannot be totally explained by changes in oxidative energy metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of action of norepinephrine (NE) on arterial baroreceptors (BRs), with the focus on regularly discharging, presumably myelinated fibers. With the use of an in vitro aortic arch/aortic nerve preparation from rats, BR single-fiber discharge was recorded simultaneously with aortic pressure and diameter. At constant suprathreshold pressure, NE had two dose-dependent effects. Inhibition was produced at low concentrations (10(-10)-10(-7) M), whereas excitation was produced at high concentrations (10(-6)-10(-5) M). Inhibition was attributed to BR unloading since the response was consistent with the fall in diameter, was mimicked by angiotensin II (10(-10)-10(-6) M), and was prevented by pretreatment with the smooth muscle relaxant sodium nitroprusside (10(-6) M) or the selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (10(-6) M). Excitation was attributed to direct activation of the BR endings since this response was independent of changes in diameter, was not mimicked by angiotensin II, and was not prevented by sodium nitroprusside but was blocked by prazosin. These results indicate that NE has two modes of action, one mediated by contraction of local vascular smooth muscle and the other due to direct excitation of the nerve endings. It was also found that BR discharge at given diameters decreased more when pressure was lowered (smooth muscle passive) than when the aorta constricted (smooth muscle active). Furthermore, if diameter was held constant during smooth muscle contraction, discharge increased, as opposed to decreasing at constant pressure. These later results suggest that BR responses to vasoactive agents reflect not only changes in wall dimension but perhaps changes in wall tension and/or the coupling relation between BR and smooth muscle structures.\r"

PGE1 (30 ng/min/kg) or its saline vehicle was infused intravenously for 90 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the infusion of activated plasma. PGE1 had no effect on leukocyte count, the initial hypoxemia and thromboxane A2 release, or the development of acute pulmonary hypertension. However, PGE1 prevented steady-state increases in lung lymph flow that in vehicle-treated sheep signaled an increase in lung microvascular permeability. Furthermore, extraction of PGE1 by pulmonary endothelial cells was unaffected by the infusion of activated plasma. We propose that PGE1 prevented the increase in lung vascular permeability by inhibiting adherence of activated neutrophils to endothelial cells.\r"

The incidence and severity of reperfusion arrhythmias was compared in 1) neurally intact animals (heart rate 208 +/- 24 beats/min), 2) animals with acute bilateral vagotomy (heart rate 233 +/- 25 beats/min), 3) animals with vagal stimulation adjusted to maintain heart rate at 90-100 beats/min, and 4) animals with vagal stimulation + ventricular pacing to maintain heart rate at prestimulation values. All the neurally intact and vagotomized animals developed complex reperfusion arrhythmias, but these arrhythmias occurred in only 60 and 72%, respectively, of the animals with vagal stimulation and vagal stimulation + pacing (p less than 0.005 vs. neurally intact and p less than 0.02 vs. vagotomy). The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was similar in neurally intact (62%) and vagotomized (58%) animals; it was strikingly lower (7%, p less than 0.01) in animals with vagal stimulation when heart rate was allowed to decrease, and it was 48% when heart rate was kept constant during vagal stimulation. A selective protection from sustained (greater than 30 seconds duration) ventricular tachycardia was observed in animals with vagal stimulation independent of heart rate changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In left atria from hatched chicks, treatment with pertussis toxin reversed the membrane action of carbachol from hyperpolarization to depolarization and reversed the inotropic effect of carbachol from negative to positive. Acetylcholine also depolarized the membrane and increased the force of contraction in atria from pertussis-toxin-treated chicks although oxotremorine did not. These cholinergic responses were blocked by atropine but not by adrenoceptor antagonists, suggesting that they are mediated via muscarinic receptors and are not due to actions of endogenously released catecholamines. Muscarinic receptor stimulation leads to two distinct biochemical responses in chick atria: inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. The former is lost in atria from pertussis-toxin-treated chicks, whereas the PI response persists. The pharmacologic characteristics of the PI response resemble those of the depolarization and positive inotropic response. Both are insensitive to blockade by pertussis toxin, require high concentrations of carbachol, and are elicited by acetylcholine but not by oxotremorine. The present study suggests that muscarinic agonist-induced PI turnover may be responsible for the membrane depolarization and positive inotropic effects of carbachol and acetylcholine; that an increase in Na+ conductance underlies these responses; and that it is stimulated either by an increase of intracellular calcium mobilized by inositol triphosphate and/or by activation by protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "The vasodilating effects of flunarizine on smooth muscle strips of rabbit mesenteric artery have been investigated and compared with those of nifedipine. Flunarizine (30-300 nM) dose-dependently inhibited Ca2+-induced contractions in Ca2+-free solution containing 100 mM K+. Double reciprocal analysis showed that this inhibition was either competitive at low concentrations (30-100 nM; nifedipine-like) or noncompetitive at high concentrations (0.3-1 microM). The latter seemed to be partly related to an inhibition of contractile proteins as estimated from Ca2+-induced contractions in saponin-treated chemically skinned muscle strips. In contrast to the actions of nifedipine, flunarizine inhibited norepinephrine (NE)-induced contractions more than those induced by high K+, and at 0.3 microM, this agent totally blocked NE-induced contraction. Flunarizine also inhibited NE-induced contraction in Ca2+-free solution containing 2 mM EGTA. In Ca2+-free solution, NE rapidly hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-P2) and produced phosphatidic acid (PA). Flunarizine (30 and 300 nM), but not nifedipine (100 nM), inhibited NE-induced hydrolysis of PI-P2 and production of PA. However, flunarizine (100 nM) did not modify the contraction induced by 10 microM inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in chemically skinned muscle strips. It is concluded that flunarizine inhibits both voltage-dependent (nifedipine-like) and receptor-operated Ca2+ influx induced by NE and also inhibits NE-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores due to inhibition of the hydrolysis of PI-P2.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of atrial pacing on the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, a relatively load-insensitive index of left ventricular performance, were studied in 8 chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. Six of the dogs were studied while autonomically intact, and 2 were studied after autonomic blockade with 2 mg/kg i.v. propranolol and 0.2 mg/kg i.v. atropine. Left ventricular pressure was measured with a micromanometer and left ventricular volume was determined from 3 ultrasonic orthogonal dimensions. Pressure was varied by caval occlusions at control heart rate and after atrial pacing at 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 bpm. The end-systolic pressure-volume relation was linear in every case (r = 0.97 +/- 0.03, SD). In the autonomically intact dogs, Emax, the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, was directly and monotonically related to heart rate in every dog, increasing to 238 +/- 99% of control at peak pacing rate (p less than 0.05). V0, the zero pressure intercept of the relation was also directly related to heart rate in every dog and increased 8.6 +/- 5.5 ml from control to peak pacing rate (p less than 0.05). Autonomic blockade did not attenuate these effects. This rightward shift of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation results in a reduced stroke volume from any end-diastolic volume, modulating the hemodynamic benefits of enhanced contractility. T, the time constant of isovolumic pressure fall during ventricular relaxation, was determined from beats with matched end-systolic pressures. T was related to heart rate, falling by 20 +/- 10.3% over the range of rates studied in the autonomically intact dogs and by 23.1 +/- 6.2% in the autonomically blocked dogs. Thus, the ventricle relaxes more rapidly at higher heart rates. We conclude that the frequency of contraction is concluded as an important determinant of overall pump function throughout the cardiac cycle in conscious dogs.\r"

Cells were fixed and embedded, and after measuring their sarcomere shortening in response to electrical stimulation, they were examined in serial thin sections by electron microscopy. This structure-function analysis showed that adult cells were significantly larger, had longer rest sarcomere lengths, greater amount and velocity of sarcomere shortening, greater velocity of reextension, and shorter contraction duration than immature cells. In immature myocytes, a thin outer shell of myofibrils enveloped a central mass of mitochondria and nuclei, but in adult cells, the cytoskeleton divided the cell into compartments with the mitochondria arranged around and interspersed among the myofibrils. The different arrangement of the organelles and the cytoskeleton at the two ages may account for the shorter rest sarcomere length in the young myocytes and may confer differing internal loads that contribute to their smaller amount and velocity of sarcomere shortening. The corbular and longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum were less demarcated in immature than in adult cells. Myocytes from both ages showed postextrasystolic potentiation, suggesting that the sarcoplasmic reticulum modulates calcium at both ages. Restitution of contractility between contractions, obtained by measuring sarcomere shortening of interpolated extrasystoles, was faster in immature than in adult cells and may reflect the structural differences in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The developmental differentiation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum suggests that changes in compartmentalization of calcium and in the distribution of putative calcium-release sites contribute to the increased contractility of adult myocytes.\r"

The level of plasma LDL is regulated by the LDL receptor, a cell surface glycoprotein that removes LDL from plasma by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Defects in the gene encoding the LDL receptor, which occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, elevate the plasma LDL level and produce premature coronary atherosclerosis. The physiologically important LDL receptors are located primarily in the liver, where their number is regulated by the cholesterol content of the hepatocyte. When the cholesterol content of hepatocytes is raised by ingestion of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol, LDL receptors fall and plasma LDL levels rise. Conversely, maneuvers that lower the cholesterol content of hepatocytes, such as ingestion of drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis (mevinolin or compactin) or prevent the reutilization of bile acids (cholestyramine or colestipol), stimulate LDL receptor production and lower plasma LDL levels. The normal process of receptor regulation can therefore be exploited in powerful and novel ways so as to reverse hypercholesterolemia and prevent atherosclerosis.\r"

This has been best established in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, a deficiency of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Although hypercholesterolemia is not the only cause of atherosclerosis, a large body of evidence has identified it as a determining cause in many cases. This article reviews current hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which hypercholesterolemia accelerates atherogenesis. The role of the foam cell is discussed in detail because it is a characteristic feature of the earliest lesion, the so-called fatty streak. Once thought to derive exclusively from smooth muscle cells, the foam cell is now known to originate in large part from monocytes that enter the artery wall and alter their properties to become tissue macrophages. Recent studies of the biology of the macrophage-derived foam cell are providing new insights into the mechanisms by which it enters the arterial wall and interacts with various classes of native and modified lipoproteins. As our understanding of the biology of the foam cell and its precursors grows, it may become possible to intervene and slow the progress of atherosclerosis by new modalities that might act synergistically with measures to control plasma cholesterol levels.\r"

In patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, marked restrictions of diet may be necessary. For these patients, drugs may be required to control cholesterol levels. However, the majority of patients with elevated plasma cholesterol can achieve a satisfactory reduction of cholesterol levels by diet, and drugs will not be necessary. Dietary therapy alone is adequate for most patients with familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia, but for a few patients drugs are required.\r"

In 15 subjects, aortic annular and root diameters were measured during similar exercise from parasternal two-dimensional echocardiograms. The linear correlation between Doppler, two-dimensional echocardiography, and the invasive estimates ranged from r = .78 to r = .92. Both echocardiographic techniques were able to predict changes in invasive flow estimates with reasonable accuracy. Two-dimensional echocardiographic flow estimates underestimated invasive values by about 60%. The accuracy of Doppler flow estimates varied with the method of estimating aortic cross-sectional area. Greatest accuracy was obtained with areas calculated from diameters measured at the aortic value anulus with the leading edge-to-leading edge method of measurement. Correlation coefficients comparing Doppler and thermodilution flow estimates were generally higher (r = .75 to .96, mean .86) for individuals than for the group, but accuracy of the Doppler estimates in single subjects was quite variable. Aortic diameters did not increase from rest to moderate levels of upright exercise. A 3% to 5% increase in resting aortic diameter was noted in the upright posture as compared with the supine. Doppler flow estimates were obtained in all subjects to maximal exertion but in only a minority of subjects with two-dimensional echocardiography or thermodilution. Thus two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography offer a noninvasive means of estimating cardiac output during vigorous exercise. The Doppler technique is technically more suitable to the study of exercise than two-dimensional echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The bidirectional shock was simultaneously delivered over two electrical vectors via a common right ventricular apical cathode and tow anodes consisting of the superior vena caval catheter electrode and cutaneous patch. The electrical therapy delivered was determined by the cycle length of VT. Slow VT (cycle length greater than 300 msec) was sequentially treated by RVP followed by incremental bidirectional shocks of 5, 15, and 25 J. Rapid VT (cycle length less than 300 msec) was treated with no incremental bidirectional shocks of 15 and 25 J. VT was reinduced to determine reproducibility of the algorithm for episodes that were successfully terminated. For patients in whom the primary algorithm failed, a second algorithm was used that excluded 5 and 15 J shocks and went directly to a 25 J shock. VT was reinduced twice and the secondary algorithm was evaluated. Thus, reproducibility of termination of VT with the primary and secondary algorithm was examined. Fifty episodes of slow VT and 40 episodes of rapid VT were induced in 22 patients (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 31 +/- 14%). Six patients had rapid VT, nine patients had slow VT, and seven patients had both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six valves had cuspal defects clearly associated with commissural sutures (\"alignment stitches\") unique to this valve design. One valve had a large basal cuspal tear. Other prominent pathologic features included gross cuspal thickening and mild stretching and microscopic deep fluid insudation, separation of collagen bundles, and mononuclear inflammation.

The MVA by Doppler ultrasound before CBV (1.0 +/- 0.2 cm2) correlated well with MVA by cardiac catheterization (1.0 +/- 0.3 cm2; r = .8, SEE = 0.2 cm2). After CBV, the correlation of MVA by Doppler ultrasound (2.0 +/- 0.5 cm2) with MVA by cardiac catheterization (2.4 +/- 0.8 cm2) was poor (r = .3, SEE = 0.44 cm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic drugs appear preferentially to prolong refractoriness of accessory pathways compared with atrial or ventricular muscle in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. This response may be due to intrinsic properties of accessory pathways or to depressed conduction associated with a narrow strip, or isthmus, of tissue. To test the latter possibility, in 16 anesthetized dogs we surgically isolated a portion of the right atrial myocardium in the form of an ellipse (10 to 25 X 8 to 15 mm). The ellipse was connected to the body of the right atrium by a narrow isthmus (cross-sectional area [CSA] 1 to 13.5 mm2) and was perfused by the sinus node artery or its branch. Diastolic threshold (mean +/- SE 0.16 +/- 0.05 vs 0.13 +/- 0.02 mA) and effective refractory period (ERP; 144 +/- 4 vs 139 +/- 5 msec) were the same proximal and distal to the isthmus. In eight dogs, determination of the ERP of the isthmus was limited by the ERP of the atrial tissue proximal and distal to the isthmus, and the CSA of the isthmus in these dogs was significantly larger than that in the remaining seven dogs in which the ERP of the isthmus could be determined (7.4 +/- 1.4 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 mm2, p less than .05). The shortest pacing cycle length (PCL) with 1:1 conduction from the proximal to the distal segments did not differ from that in the opposite direction in 16 dogs (154 +/- 9 vs 153 +/- 7 msec). The CSA of the isthmus correlated inversely with the shortest PCL with 1:1 conduction in both directions via the isthmus (r = -.84, p less than .01). Vagal stimulation shortened the shortest PCL with 1:1 conduction from the distal to the proximal segment (153 +/- 14 vs 143 +/- 12 msec, p less than .02), but not in the opposite direction. Procainamide (10 to 20 mg/kg iv, serum concentration 8.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml) prolonged the ERP of the proximal site from 145 +/- 5 to 170 +/- 5 msec (p less than .001), the ERP of the distal site from 143 +/- 6 to 168 +/- 6 msec (p less than .001) in 12 dogs, and the shortest PCL with 1:1 conduction (proximal to distal from 149 +/- 8 to 204 +/- 17 msec, p less than .001; distal to proximal from 149 +/- 7 to 197 +/- 12 msec, p less than .001) in 14 dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

BAEC cultures not exposed to shear or flow (no stress) were also studied. A shear stress of 30 dyne/cm2 resulted in cellular elongation and alignment, changes that were largely complete by 24 hr. In experiments in which BAECs were incubated with 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein for 2 or 24 hr in the presence of shear stress levels, 125I-LDL internalization at 24 hr was increased (p less than .05) in response to high-stress conditions. This increased uptake of 125I-LDL was observed in BAECs prealigned for 24 hr under high stress and in BAECs undergoing alignment in the presence of circulating 125I-LDL. BAECs were also exposed to shear stress for 24 hr in the presence of a lipoprotein-deficient circulating medium to maximize LDL receptor expression. Receptor-mediated 125I-LDL internalization and degradation measured immediately after shear stress were both significantly enhanced (p less than .01) in BAECs exposed to high stress. Furthermore, 125I-LDL binding studies at 4 degrees C revealed a significant increase (p less than .01) in specific 125I-LDL binding to BAECs exposed to high stress relative to those exposed to low or no stress. Nonspecific 125I-LDL endocytosis was not influenced by shear stress levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The simplified Bernoulli relationship appears to be quite accurate for predicting gradients across discrete valvular obstructions. Controversy exists about how accurately it predicts the severity of disease in longer segment obstructions. In this study we constructed a pulsatile model of subvalvular pulmonary stensosis in vitro to study nine custom-made subvalvular tunnels 2, 4, and 7 mm in length with flow cross sections of 0.5 to 1.5 cm2 and with the stenotic segment proximal to a nonstenotic bioprosthetic valve, and a pulsatile model in vitro of a 16 mm long tunnel-like ventricular septal defect (VSD) of varying cross-sectional area (0.20 to 0.64 cm2). We also compared the observations in vitro with those in an open-chest dog preparation with a tunnel-like interventricular communication. In the subpulmonic stenosis model, for each individual tunnel, 10 instantaneous peak gradients between 15 to 105 mm Hg were available. The pressure gradients across the tunnel alone, measured in the subvalvular area, were consistently higher than the measured gradients across the tunnel plus valve, suggesting some relaminarization of flow (i.e., a decrease in velocity) and pressure recovery (i.e., an increase in pressure) distal to the obstruction. Continuous-wave Doppler velocities across the 4 and 7 mm tunnels for the highest gradients were slightly lower than for the 2 mm tunnel at the same gradients, and it was only for the 0.5 cm2 cross section, 4 and 7 mm tunnels that there was a suggestion of minor viscous energy loss. For all the subvalvular tunnels studied, the Bernoulli relationship accurately predicted the results of the pressure drop across the tunnel only, while the gradient across tunnel plus valve was consistently lower. For the VSD tunnel model in vitro, the Doppler-derived gradients were approximately 40% higher than the measured gradients. The findings for the subvalvular and VSD tunnels in vitro and similar findings in the open-chest dogs with VSD suggest that relaminarization of flow and recovery of pressure occurred distal to the tunnel orifice, whereas continuous-wave Doppler findings correlate with the highest instantaneous gradients measured in the lowest pressure areas at the vena contracta of the tunnel.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of time-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (ICSO) in preserving regional and global mechanical function during acute ischemia in an animal preparation without significant arterial collateral vessels. Seventeen (eight control, nine ICSO) swine heart preparations undergoing extracorporeal coronary perfusion in situ were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) distal to the first major diagonal branch. Data were obtained before and immediately after coronary artery ligation in both animal groups. ICSO, 15 sec of occlusion alternating with 5 sec of release, was then begun in the treatment group. Additional data were obtained in both control and treatment groups at 15 min intervals for 1 hr starting immediately after coronary artery ligation. Global left ventricular function was assessed by shifts in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular dP/dt with left ventricular systolic pressure maintained at about 100 mm Hg. Regional mechanical function was evaluated with transmurally placed ultrasonic crystals. Pressure was also measured directly in the coronary sinus and LAD distal to the ligature. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured in the ischemic bed using 9 micron diameter radiolabeled microspheres injected before, immediately after, and 60 min after coronary artery ligation in both treated and control animals. LAD mean pressure measured distal to the ligation (less than 16 mm Hg) and ischemic bed myocardial blood flow (less than 0.01 ml/g/min) confirmed the absence of significant arterial-arterial collaterals in this preparation. Mean coronary sinus pressure increased significantly (p less than .001) in treated animals during ICSO (e.g., 11.2 +/- 1.6 to 66.2 +/- 10.0 mm Hg at 15 min after coronary ligation). Mean LAD pressure distal to the coronary ligature also increased during ICSO (14.2 +/- 1.2 to 26.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg), with a similar but delayed rate of pressure rise. No significant differences in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or left ventricular dP/dt were noted between control or treated animals after coronary ligation. Ischemic bed systolic wall thickening, present before coronary ligation, was not present after occlusion and was not improved during intermittent coronary sinus occlusion in the treatment group. We conclude that in an animal preparation without significant collateral circulation, intermittent coronary sinus occlusion is incapable of restoring regional or global left ventricular mechanical function during conditions of acute ischemia.\r"

Animals were randomized to receive 25 mg/kg iv oxypurinol (n = 13) or saline (n = 13) 60 min after occlusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres and regional ventricular function with contrast ventriculography. Hemodynamic variables, regional myocardial blood flow, and size of the occluded bed were similar in the two groups. Oxypurinol failed to reduce infarct size 24 hr after reperfusion when expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (36.3 +/- 4.9% vs 36.0 +/- 5.6%; p = NS). Both groups exhibited comparative radial shortening at baseline and similar degrees of dyskinesia 1 hr into occlusion (-6.6 +/- 1.2% vs -4.9 +/- 1.0%). However, oxypurinol-treated animals demonstrated an improved regional ventricular function at 3 hr after reperfusion (0.7 +/- 2.6% vs -2.8 +/- 2.0%) and a significant improvement at 24 hr (5.4 +/- 2.5% vs -3.2 +/- 1.7%; p less than .05). A reduced neutrophil infiltrate was observed in the border zone in treated animals. These findings suggest that oxygen free radicals derived from the xanthine oxidase pathway contribute to stunning of reversibly damaged myocardium but do not determine the final extent of myocardial necrosis in a canine preparation of reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have documented a quantitative relation between alterations in transmural myocardial blood flow and body surface electrocardiographic distributions during rapid atrial pacing after chronic occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). Because other studies have described functional differences between the left anterior descending (LAD) and the LCx perfusion beds, we tested the hypothesis that these two territories exhibit quantitative differences in their responses to demand-dependent myocardial ischemia. To do so, 25 sedated dogs were studied 3 weeks after implantation of an ameroid constrictor around the proximal LCx (15 dogs, group I) or the LAD (group II). Oxygen demand was increased by rapid atrial pacing at rates of 90 to 210 beats/min, myocardial blood flow was measured by serial injections of radiolabeled microspheres, and the electrocardiographic consequences were evaluated by isopotential body surface mapping. Endocardial flows and the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio fell to significantly lower levels during atrial pacing in the ischemic LAD bed than in the LCx perfusion zone. Electrocardiographic patterns indicative of subendocardial ischemia also developed with lesser abnormalities in endocardial/epicardial ratios as determined by logistic regression models, in the LAD than in the LCx bed. Thus the LAD bed is more susceptible to ischemia than the LCx region because of differences in collateral blood flow patterns. In addition, the intensity of the surface electrocardiographic potentials during ischemia was significantly greater, as measured by linear regression, after LAD than after LCx obstruction. These data thus demonstrate significant differences between the two cardiac regions as electrocardiographic potential sources during ischemia.\r"

Resting flows did not change in any group. In group C, hyperemic flow decreased in both the LAD and LCx by 15% to 20% (p less than .001) over 30 to 90 min, suggesting that a circulating substance changed coronary resistance. Histologic and ultrastructural studies of the LADs demonstrated an intact endothelial cell layer in group A, endothelial disruption with a few adherent platelets in group B, medial injury with a dense layer of adherent platelets in group C, and medial injury with a few adherent platelets in group D. Thus endothelial denudation results in relatively mild platelet deposition and no change in resting or hyperemic coronary blood flow. In contrast, medial injury results in relatively marked platelet deposition and a significant decrease in hyperemic flow, both of which are prevented by platelet inhibition with aspirin.\r"

  ".W": "We used a sonomicrometric determination of ventricular dimension to examine the effect of ischemia and reperfusion on the work-length relationship in the intact heart to develop a useful and precise variable of ventricular contractile response to injury. Twenty anesthetized dogs were instrumented with epicardial ultrasonic dimension transducers to record right ventricular free wall chord length and left ventricular minor-axis length, micromanometers to record ventricular pressures, and an electromagnetic probe to record pulmonary arterial (n = 8) or aortic (n = 7) flow. Dogs were subjected to either 20 min (n = 7) or 30 min (n = 13) of global cardiac ischemia supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. Data were acquired over a range of end-diastolic volumes produced by transient (5 to 10 sec) vena caval occlusion before and after ischemia. In both ventricles, systolic epicardial dimensional shortening correlated with flow probe-measured stroke volume (mean r = .969) and regional stroke work calculated as the integral of instantaneous ventricular pressure and epicardial dimension correlated with measured global stroke work (mean r = .960), confirming the validity of dimensional measurements. Regression analysis demonstrated a highly linear relationship between calculated regional stroke work and end-diastolic length in the right ventricle (mean r = .973) and left ventricle (mean r = .967), quantifiable by a slope (Mw) and x intercept (Lw). Change in afterload produced by pulmonary arterial or aortic constriction resulted in no significant changes in Mw or Lw in either ventricle. Ischemia and reperfusion decreased Mw and shifted Lw to the right in both ventricles. The decrease in Mw with 30 min ischemia exceeded the decrease with 20 min ischemia by 29% in the right ventricle and by 32% in the left (p less than .04) with up to 1 hr of reperfusion. Changes in Lw were not related to severity of injury. After ischemia, infusion of calcium increased Mw by 177% in the right ventricle and by 67% in the left (p less than .03) without significant changes in Lw. Independent of load conditions, the slope Mw, of the linear stroke work vs end-diastolic length relationship is a valid and precise index of right and left ventricular contractile response to global ischemia in the intact circulation. This variable may be useful in evaluating therapies designed to limit myocardial injury and enhance ventricular functional performance.\r"

Ultrafast computed tomography (CT) has the capability of rapid imaging (17 frames/sec) coupled with high spatial resolution (1.5 mm2). Eight millimeter thick images can be acquired to interrogate simultaneously the right and left ventricles. End-diastolic and end-systolic tomograms can be reconstructed serially from apex to base by Simpson's rule to provide end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes from which the right and left ventricular stroke volumes can be derived. To determine whether the difference between left and right ventricular stroke volume measured with ultrafast CT could be used to estimate the volume of experimentally induced aortic regurgitation, we studied six dogs in which proximal aortic electromagnetic flow probes had been implanted. Varying degrees of aortic regurgitation were induced by manipulation of a basket catheter through the aortic valve. During suspended respiration in the control state in the absence of aortic regurgitation, right and left ventricular stroke volumes measured with ultrafast CT were nearly identical (mean difference 1.0 +/- 1.2 ml [mean +/- SE]). In the presence of varying degrees of aortic regurgitation, regurgitant volume derived by ultrafast CT as the difference between right and left ventricular stroke volumes correlated closely to the regurgitant volume measured by the electromagnetic flow probe (r = .99, slope = .92, y intercept = 0.98 ml, SEE = 1.02 ml, n = 16).

Mean age was 71 years, and mean ejection fraction was 56% (range 36% to 83%). Eight patients had a preoperative history of angina, 13 had a history of myocardial infarction, and five had electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction. A group of 51 closely matched patients with AAA who did not receive metoprolol served as controls (group 2). In group 1, overall hemodynamic tolerance of metoprolol intraoperatively and postoperatively was good, and there was no incidence of congestive heart failure, hypotension, or asthma. Furthermore, in group 1 significant reduction of systolic blood pressure and heart rate was consistently noted at frequent intraoperative intervals and for 48 hr after surgery, with only a transient reduction of cardiac index. In group 1, only one patient (3%) suffered an acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, nine group 2 patients (18%; p less than .05) suffered perioperative myocardial infarction. Furthermore, only four (12.5%) group 1 patients developed significant cardiac arrhythmias as opposed to 29 group 2 patients (56.9%; p less than .001). These data demonstrate that beta-blockade with metoprolol is effective in controlling systolic blood pressure and heart rate both intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing repair of AAA and can significantly reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive residual mitral regurgitation after mitral valve reconstruction or coronary artery bypass graft surgery may necessitate reoperation. We evaluated a new intraoperative technique for assessment of mitral regurgitation, real-time two-dimensional Doppler color flow mapping, in 96 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In comparison with technically adequate preoperative left ventriculography (n = 68) obtained at a similar level of afterload (systolic arterial pressure), Doppler color flow mapping demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% (50/53) and specificity of 93% (14/15) for detection of the presence and absence of mitral regurgitation, respectively. Semiquantitative comparison of color Doppler with angiography demonstrated excellent agreement (kappa = .80, p less than .001), differing by more than one grade in two patients (3%). The pulmonary capillary wedge \"V\" wave pressure (absolute magnitude, and height above mean) correlated poorly with the simultaneously obtained mitral regurgitation grade by color Doppler, both before (r = .37 and .45) and after (r = .04 and -.15, p = NS) cardiopulmonary bypass. No value of the V wave clearly distinguished 3 + or 4 + regurgitation from lesser degrees of regurgitation. In 15 patients who underwent mitral valve repair, fluid filling of the ventricle was falsely positive (leak, with no regurgitation) in 40% (2/5), and falsely negative (no leak, with 2 + to 3 + regurgitation) in 30% (3/10). Regurgitation grade by color Doppler demonstrated a highly significant (p less than .01) dependence on systolic pressure, suggesting that intraoperative changes in afterload conditions importantly influence mitral regurgitation severity. Thus, Doppler color flow mapping provides accurate intraoperative evaluation of mitral regurgitation and may aid surgical decision making.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mitral stenosis (MS) was the predominate lesion in 24 patients, mitral incompetence in 22, and mixed in two. Most patients with MS had so-called typical congenital MS (Van Praagh) with abnormalities of all valvular components; virtual or complete absence of chordal development was a consistent finding. Other anatomic substrates (not mutually exclusive) producing MS included supramitral ring with Shone's complex (n = 5), parachute mitral valve (n = 2), hypoplastic mitral ring (n = 3), and rheumatic lesions (n = 3). The anatomic substrates producing mitral incompetence included annular dilatation (n = 16; isolated in seven), leaflet prolapse (n = 7), cleft leaflet (n = 6), leaflet deficiency (n = 3), and rheumatic lesions (n = 2). Concurrent repair of associated lesions was performed in 29 (60%) patients for relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n = 16) and closure of ventricular septal defects (n = 9; double-outlet right ventricle in three). Six (12.5%) patients had previous repair of coarctation of the aorta. The operative mortality rate was 18.7% (70% confidence limits [CL]; 12.8% to 24.6%), with one death in 35 patients since 1975 (2.9%; 70% CL; 0% to 5.8%). The actuarial freedom from early or late death and reoperation (+/- SEM) was 44.0% +/- 14.8% at 8 years postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A small aortic prosthesis can be inserted in selected patients with excellent symptomatic improvement. A prospective evaluation was performed on 321 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1984. Smaller prostheses (19 or 21 mm, predominantly pericardial valves, 132 patients) were inserted in older patients (p = .0001), women (p = .0001), smaller patients (body surface area: p = .0001), and patients with aortic stenosis (p = .0001). Twelve patients died in-hospital (3.7%) and 33 died during the follow-up period, producing an actuarial survival of 80% +/- 4% at 48 months. Survival was independently predicted by advancing age (p = .009), the preoperative NYHA functional class (p = .04) but not valve size (p = .28). Eighty-nine percent of patients were NYHA class I or II postoperatively compared with 22% preoperatively. Symptomatic recovery was similar for those with smaller size valves. Postoperative Doppler echocardiography in 57 patients revealed significant differences in aortic valve areas and gradients between the valve sizes. The 19 mm pericardial valves had the smallest areas (1.0 +/- 0.3 cm2) and the highest gradients (34 +/- 20 mm Hg). The aortic valve gradient was significantly related to cardiac output and valve size (p = .0001 by analysis of covariance). Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the aortic valve gradient during exercise (a 50% increase in cardiac output). The estimated exercise gradient was disturbingly high for the 19 mm valves (55 +/- 16 mm Hg), but the estimated exercise gradients for the 21, 23, and 25 mm valves were similar, all below 30 mm Hg. Aortic valve replacement with a small prosthesis resulted in excellent symptomatic improvement and acceptable resting valve gradients. However, a 19 mm prosthesis may produce prohibitive gradients during exercise, which may limit symptomatic recovery and should be avoided in active patients.\r"

One hundred ninety patients underwent anticoagulation with modest doses of warfarin (Coumadin), with prothrombin times in the range of 1.3 to 1.5 times control. Fourteen patients received aspirin and dipyridamole only. Follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 years (mean 3.1) and was 99.5% complete. The group was analyzed for occurrence of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, perivalvular leak, valve failure, late cardiac death, and all morbidity and mortality combined in linear and actuarial terms over the 7 year period. With this anticoagulation regimen, the linear rate for thromboembolism and hemorrhage was 0.67% and 1.3% patient-year, respectively, and the actuarial event-free incidence at 5 years was 97.4% and 94.4%, respectively. There were no instances of structural valve failure and one instance of valve thrombosis in the mitral position. Eighty-seven percent of patients were alive at 5 years and 76.7% of patients were alive and free of all complications at 5 years. We conclude that the St. Jude Medical valve has a low incidence of thromboembolism, hemorrhagic complications, and valve thrombosis in patients receiving modest doses of warfarin.\r"

  ".W": "The infrequency of spinal cord infarction and paraplegia after occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta has effectively precluded statistical identification of risk factors. Reversible spinal cord ischemia (SCI), however, is more common, can be detected by intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring, and can lead to irreversible spinal cord damage. Spinal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored intraoperatively in 38 patients (18 days to 18 years) undergoing coarctation repair (1982-1986). Although no patients sustained perioperative neurologic dysfunction, 10 of 38 (26%) patients developed reversible SCI, as reflected by greater than 75% loss of SEP N1-P1 interpeak amplitude during aortic occlusion (mean clamp time, 29.1 +/- 1.1 min). During occlusion, seven of 38 (18%) sustained complete loss of the SEP; uniform and prompt (1 to 6 min after clamp release) recovery of the signal occurred in these patients with reperfusion following completion of the repair (n = 6), or temporary institution of partial occlusion (n = 1). By multiple regression analysis the degree of SCI was negatively related to the distal aortic pressure (mean 32.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, p = .03), and the occlusion PCO2 (mean 33.1 +/- 1.1 mm Hg; p = .013), and positively related to the change in proximal systolic pressure with aortic occlusion (mean 19.8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p = .003). We conclude that: (1) distal hypotension and SCI commonly occur during aortic occlusion for coarctation repair, and (2) intraoperative interventions that can potentially influence distal aortic perfusion and/or PCO2 should be used judiciously.\r"

Two patients underwent aortic valve replacement alone and six had only the mitral PBV replaced. The one survivor of the repeat aortic valve replacement has a normally functioning mitral PBV, which has now been in place for 48 months. The six patients who had their mitral PBVs replaced have normally functioning aortic PBVs that have now been in place for periods from 96 to 176 months. Our experience shows that with asynchronous PBV failure only the dysfunctioning valve needs to be replaced. Prophylactic PBV replacement is not warranted if the prosthesis demonstrates normal hemodynamics on cardiac catheterization and normal structure on the echocardiogram, regardless of the length of time it has been implanted.\r"

The duration of palliation with flow limited by a fixed conduit between the subclavian and pulmonary artery is unknown. Between October 1980 and June 1985 forty-nine patients received 55 shunts. Age at operation was 1 day to 15 years (median 2 weeks), with 29 patients less than 3 months old. Weights were 1.7 to 53 kg, with 31 patients less than 5 kg. There were two early (4%) and four late (9%) deaths, none shunt related. The 43 late survivors were followed from 2 to 60 months (mean 27 +/- 16). Late study in 32 patients revealed a mean PO2 of 52 +/- 2 mm Hg. No patient had pulmonary arterial distortion or hypertension. In 10 patients inadequate shunt function was noted from 12 to 34 months after operation (mean 28 +/- 10). There were no sudden failures and all shunts remained patent. Univariate analysis revealed that age less than 3 months (p = .0154) and weight less than 3.6 kg (p = .0110) were risk factors predictive of earlier shunt failure. The mean satisfactory shunt survival time for these two groups was 38 +/- 3.6 and 35 +/- 3.7 months, respectively. The presence of pulmonary atresia (p = .1175) and the specific diagnostic group (p = .7620) were not of themselves risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventricular function was assessed angiographically by end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) and ejection fraction (EF), and attempts were made to measure ventricular mass index (VMI) and VM/EDV. In 14 patients, the preoperative and postoperative results (average 2.4 years after placement of BT shunt) were compared in SLV (n = 5) and SRV (n = 9) groups. The SLV group showed significant increases in EDVI, VMI, and VM/EDV without a significant change in EF. The SRV group showed significant increases in EDVI and VMI, while EF decreased and VM/EDV was unchanged. Late death from congestive heart failure occurred in five patients with SRV. Three patients with atrioventricular valve regurgitation suffered late death. Among the patients with SRV, the late death group had significantly lower preoperative EF and VM/EDV compared with the survivors (n = 13). All of those with a preoperative EF of less than 0.50 and a VM/EDV of less than 0.35 g/ml suffered late death. In summary, patients with SRV appear to fail to develop adaptational hypertrophy to volume loading after the BT shunt procedure, with concomitant depression in ventricular pump function. Also, late cardiac failure seems likely to develop when low EF and VM/EDV are present preoperatively.\r"

Its presence increases the risk of septation or Fontan repair, and reports of surgical management have indicated high mortality. This report describes the results of an approach that includes direct resection of the stenosis via an aortotomy, and delay of the Fontan repair to a later date. Nine children with single ventricle underwent surgery for subaortic stenosis from 1968 to 1984. Three deaths occurred postoperatively from ventricular dysfunction in patients who underwent either conduit bypass (one patient) or repair via ventriculotomy (two patients). Of the six long-term survivors, one infant underwent ventriculotomy and subaortic resection, and the last five patients had subaortic resection via an aortotomy without any other simultaneous procedure. Avoidance of ventriculotomy and decreased cardiopulmonary bypass time lowers the risk of stenosis repair in the presence of a hypertrophied ventricle. Fontan repair after some regression of the ventricular hypertrophy is recommended, and has been accomplished in one patient to date. All patients repaired via aortotomy are alive and well 1 to 6 years postoperatively.\r"

Two patients died within 1 week of surgery, and two died within 9 months for a total mortality of 8%. Each of the 40 remaining patients was catheterized 6 months to 10.8 years (mean 4.9 years) after placement of a SAPS. By the criteria of Choussat and Fontan, there were one or more adverse SAPS-induced changes in nine patients (23%). Three developed pulmonary hypertension, one with associated elevation of pulmonary arteriolar resistance and pulmonary artery distortion, and one in conjunction with severe congestive heart failure. Six additional patients developed isolated distortion of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery. Of these nine patients, three had successful Fontan operations (33%), two died after the Fontan operation, and four are no longer candidates. In contrast, of 31 patients without documented SAPS-induced complications, 27 have undergone Fontan operations, 23 successfully (74%).

Among those with DIRV, right isomerism with a common atrioventricular (AV) valve was found in eight and situs inversus in one; among those with mitral atresia, AV discordance was found in two and concordance in two. Intra-atrial routing using a baffle with atriopulmonary anastomosis was the main procedure (11 patients). There were two operative deaths (one DIRV, one mitral atresia) and three hospital deaths, with an early mortality of 38.5% overall (DIRV 44%, mitral atresia 25%). Low cardiac output was the main cause of death, with relatively high right atrial pressure and with tachyarrhythmias in most of the patients. Mortality was 75% for patients with DIRV who had total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (n = 4) and 20% for those without (n = 5). Preoperative ventricular volume and ejection fraction were not different between those with severely low cardiac output (n = 4, three deaths) and the others, whereas ventricular mass/volume ratio was significantly lower in the former group. Two late deaths (one DIRV, one mitral atresia) related to the AV valve regurgitation. These results may indicate a relatively poor outcome after the modified Fontan operation for patients with univentricular heart of right ventricular type as a result of basic anatomic and hemodynamic problems.\r"

In the second technique, the superior vena cava is transected and the cardiac and cephalad ends are anastomosed separately to the pulmonary arterial confluence. A patch is positioned inside the right atrium to separate the systemic from the pulmonary venous drainage. Both techniques achieve unrestricted systemic and pulmonary venous channels.

  ".W": "During a 10 year period 109 patients (3 months to 47 years old) underwent modifications of the Fontan procedure for repair of classic tricuspid atresia (TA) (n = 58), univentricular atrioventricular connection (UVH) (n = 38), or other complex malformations (CM) (n = 13). Among patients with TA, an atriopulmonary connection was used in 19 (33%) and incorporation of the right ventricle with the Bjork modification and with a right atrial-to-right ventricular valved conduit was used in 20 (34%) and in 19 (33%), respectively. Three of the latter 19 also underwent a combined Fontan-switch procedure. The hospital mortality rate was 13.8% (70% confidence limits, 9.3% to 18.3%) for patients with TA, 28.9% (70% confidence limits, 21.3% to 37.0%) for patients with UVH, and 7.7% (70% confidence limits, 0% to 15.4%) for patients with CM. Multivariate analysis identified with the following variables as risk factors for both early and late deaths: diagnosis of UVH, previous pulmonary artery banding (PAB), and postrepair right atrial pressure, and, in patients with TA, the use of a direct atriopulmonary connection (all variables, p less than .05). Morphometric lung biopsy scores were not different in patients with PAB, implicating the role of ventricular hypertrophy rather than pulmonary vascular disease as the mechanism for the adverse effect of PAB. Right atrial pressure was a predictor of serious late cardiac symptoms, which were present in 10% of eligible patients (p = .032). This review demonstrates a survival advantage with modifications of the Fontan procedure that incorporate the hypoplastic right ventricle in patients with TA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This represents 67% of the total number of patients undergoing the procedure during this period. There were 32 (12%) in-hospital deaths (14 tricuspid atresia, 18 double-inlet ventricle) and 23 late deaths (13 tricuspid atresia, 10 double-inlet ventricle). For patients surviving to hospital dismissal, the 5 year survival was 87%. Follow-up data (mean 3.9 years) were obtained for 157 patients who survived at least 1 year after operation. At last follow-up, of the 157 patients, 92% were in NYHA class I or II, 92% claimed to be improved clinically by the operation, and 98% could work or attend school. Fifty percent were not taking medication at last follow-up. Some degree of edema or ascites was found in 16%. The study showed that (1) the modified Fontan procedure can be performed with low in-hospital mortality (12%) in patients with tricuspid atresia and double-inlet ventricle, (2) hospital survivors have an estimated 5 year survival of 87%, (3) subjectively, functional status is good for hospital survivors at intermediate follow-up, and (4) fluid retention continues to be a problem in a minority (16%) of patients.\r"

  ".U": "87302189\r", 
  ".W": "The Fontan principle of right ventricular exclusion is frequently applied to complex congenital lesions. Results are adversely affected by increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and/or ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Survival depends on means to increase pulmonary blood flow. To address this problem, we have developed a triple-balloon catheter that is passed via the femoral vein to the right atrium. Inflation is sequenced so that small balloons located at the junction of each vena cava with the atrium inflate first. Then the larger central balloon inflates, ejecting blood from the right atrium to the pulmonary arteries. The pump is timed to inflate during ventricular systole. In this study, we tested the catheter in vivo in eight dogs. Tricuspid atresia was created and right ventricular exclusion accomplished. Pulmonary blood flow was measured with a flow probe in the right atrium-to-pulmonary artery conduit, at central venous pressures of 15, 20, and 25 mm Hg. Pulmonary blood flow was increased by balloon pumping in every instance (p less than .05). Maximal augmentation of pulmonary blood flow (25.5%) was achieved at a central venous pressure of 15 mm Hg with a balloon ratio of 1:2. Less augmentation was achieved at a central venous pressures of 20 mm Hg (8.4% to 13.0%) and a 25 mm Hg (4.4% to 5.3%) and at balloon ratios of 1:4 and 1:8. We conclude that (1) a triple-balloon pump in the right atrium can significantly augment pulmonary blood flow after right ventricular exclusion and (2) most effective augmentation can be achieved without excessive volume loading. Pulsatile augmentation of pulmonary blood flow with this device should improve survival after Fontan operations.\r"

  ".U": "87302191\r", 
  ".W": "In 11 men undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery, simultaneous blood samples were analyzed by use of sensitive markers of thrombin activity (fibrinopeptide A, FPA) and platelet behavior (beta-thromboglobulin, beta-TG), as well as conventional clotting times. FPA levels were consistently higher in the venous outflow from the ischemic limb compared with the arterial inflow (p less than .01), while no venoarterial difference was noted for beta-TG. This suggests that there is increased thrombin generation, but not platelet activation localized to the ischemic limb. After a mean dose of 6800 units of heparin given during surgery, FPA levels fell significantly (p less than .03), and the activated clotting time (ACT) was prolonged to 230 to 260 sec, but beta-TG levels did not change. Anticoagulation during lower extremity vascular surgery may be usefully monitored by the activated clotting time because an ACT longer than 250 sec is correlated with lower FPA levels (less than 10 ng/ml), reflecting significant inhibition of coagulation.\r"

Most of these patients underwent operation at less than 1 month of age (39 of 75, 52%). Operative approaches used were the standardized left-sided approach for supracardiac and infracardiac TAPVC, reserving transatrial repair for only the intracardiac lesions. Cardiopulmonary bypass was managed by deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest in 16 of 75 (29%) and continuous hypothermic bypass with low flow was used for the remaining 59 of 75 (71%). Operative policy included maintaining patency of existing patent ductus (1 patient) and atrial (4 patients) or ventricular (3 patients) defects to allow additional shunting in cases of severe obstruction. Operative mortality was 9.3% (7 of 75) and late mortality was 6.7% (5 of 75). The determinants of operative deaths were (1) the type of TAPVC (highest rates in types III and IV with 3 of 17 or 19%, and 2 of 8 or 25%, respectively) and (2) associated severe preoperative pulmonary-to-systemic venous obstruction. Determinants of late death were (1) residual pulmonary-to-systemic obstruction (two patients type III and 1 patient type I), and (2) associated intracardiac lesions (two patients type IV with atrioventricular canal). In summary, the timing of corrective surgery and outcome are influenced by the clinical condition of the infant as a direct reflection of the anatomic type and severity of associated lesions.\r"

The hemoglobin ranged from 13.2 to 22.4 g/dl (mean 16.6), the hematocrit ranged from 40.2% to 68.2% (mean 49.0%), and the arterial oxygen saturation ranged from 63% to 97% (mean 83.8%).

There were two in-hospital deaths from low cardiac output. None of the 10 survivors had complete heart block, residual ventricular septal defect, aortic incompetence, or coronary arterial injury. Transaortic closure of ventricular septal defect is preferred in corrected transposition because it minimizes complete heart block (the conduction system courses subendocardially in the pulmonary ventricle), allows secure placement of the patch (on the high-pressure side of the defect), and limits coronary arterial and anterior papillary muscle injury (the pulmonary ventriculotomy for conduit anastomosis may be made in an apical location).\r"

Low output may be caused by impaired left ventricular filling from right ventricular dilatation. We studied 12 children during the first 72 hr after surgery by measuring right ventricular pericardial surface pressure with a flat balloon and compared the results with acute changes in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). All 12 children (ages 4 to 14 months) had preexisting large left-to-right shunts with systemic PAPs. We found a highly significant linear correlation between acute rises in PAP and rises in the pericardial pressure (PP). The regression equation was PAP = 1.48(PP) + 5.7, R2 = .61, p less than .001. There was an average of 15.6 pulmonary hypertensive episodes per patient during the 72 hr study period, but only 9% of these episodes were associated with either no change or a fall in systemic pressure. We conclude that changes in right ventricular pericardial pressure reflect acute changes in PAP.\r"

Univariate testing did not document any correlation between age, functional class, rhythm, and either survival or reoperation-free survival. When feasible, repeat OMC can afford patients excellent long-term survival and relative freedom from prosthetic valve replacement.\r"

To verify this hypothesis, we examined the alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors on blood cells after 1/2 h in the resting supine position with the peritoneal cavity filled for 2-3 h, as well as the response of plasma norepinephrine (NE), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to 10 min of standing. Supine free and particularly conjugated NE levels were significantly higher in all uremic patients compared with controls. The postural test induced similar increases of MAP and HR in 8 diabetic, 11 nondiabetic patients and 23 controls, whereas 4 diabetic patients became hypotensive. Orthostasis caused a mean free NE increment of only 0.5 nmol/l in the latter patient group with mean NE responses of 1.45-1.65 nmol/l in the former 3 groups. The densities of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors (assessed by [3H] yohimbine binding) and of mononuclear leucocyte (MNL) beta 2-adrenoceptors determined by (-) (125I) iodocyanopindolol binding amounted to 160 +/- 50 and 1600 +/- 520 binding sites/cell, respectively, in controls and were unchanged in patients without postural hypotension. The 4 diabetic patients suffering from postural hypotension showed numerically higher beta 2-receptor numbers (2080 binding sites/cell), significantly increased alpha 2-receptor densities (280 binding sites/cell, p less than 0.05) and significantly increased MNL isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities (38 vs 24 pmol cAMP/10(6) MNL/10 min in controls, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean basal GFR and ERPF were 17.8 and 93.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. DA infusion had no significant influence on GFR but effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased by 14% (p less than 0.05). After DA, GFR did not correlate with ERPF. There was a significant increase in urinary sodium excretion (+22%). Sodium excretion correlated with osmotic clearance and urine flow rate with free water clearance. Plasma prolactin concentration was decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas noradrenaline, adrenaline and free dopamine increased significantly after DA. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide levels remained unchanged. The data indicate that in pediatric patients with advanced renal failure DA fails to increase filtration capacity, whereas effective renal plasma flow and sodium excretion are stimulated. It is speculated that in this situation preglomerular and tubular renal functions regulated by dopamine receptors are better conserved than those affecting glomerular microcirculation.\r"

The incidence of trochanteric and femoral neck fracture for men doubled every 7.8 and 7.0 years, respectively. The doubling rate of fracture incidence for premenopausal women, aged 30 to 49 years, did not significantly differ from that for postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 69 years. These findings suggest that age-associated factors common to both sexes provide the main risk for fracturing the proximal femur. Menopause does not pose a major risk.\r"

Follow-up examination times ranged from one year to 2.5 years with 33 patients having follow-up periods of at least two years. Preoperative diagnoses were osteoarthritis (OA), 37; osteonecrosis (ON), six; dysplasia, nine; rheumatoid ankylosing spondylitis, three; and other, two. Sixteen hips had metal-backed acrylic-fixed THARIES (total hip articular replacement by internal eccentric shells) acetabular sockets, nine hips had a cobalt chrome hemispherical beaded acetabular component with adjuvant screws, and 32 hips had a chamfer-cylinder designed acetabulum. Pain relief has been immediate and more complete than with acrylic-fixed or biologic-in-growth stem-type replacements with comparable walking and function improvements. There have been no major systemic complications, sepsis, or loosening. There have been two transient peroneal nerve palsies and three trochanteric fibrous unions. There has been one subluxation requiring reoperation. Histologic sections of the removed femoral surface component showed excellent (90%) bone ingrowth. Circumferential progressive radiolucencies developed at the bone-cement interface by one year in all of the 16 acrylic-fixed acetabular components. Reaming or seating defects were noted in 25% of the patients on postoperative radiographs. Serial radiographic analyses demonstrate progressive narrowing of all of the chamfered cylinder design and less in hemispherical design with screw fixation. These observations are encouraging and suggest healing of the bone-component interface with bony trabeculae in the porous-coated acetabular design. This new surface replacement (SR) of the hip uses porous-ingrowth fixation to overcome the major disadvantages of acrylic-fixed SR which are as follows: (1) excessive acetabular reaming, (2) poor long-term fixation, and (3) difficulty with acetabular revision.\r"

The precise localization of the nidus of an osteoid osteoma often can be difficult using nothing more than conventional radiographs. In a series of 35 patients, a radionuclide and double density sign facilitated localization of the nidus, confirmed the diagnosis, and aided the surgeon in excision biopsy. This series of cases demonstrates how computed tomography (CT) scanning can more precisely localize the nidus in areas deep in complex joints such as the hip. Fifteen cases of osteoid osteoma were studied with Tc-99m-MDP radionuclide bone scan. Each one exhibited the double density sign. Seven of these patients had CT scans in addition for further localization of the nidus. All were excised with accurate localization of the nidus, and thereby reduced morbidity and postoperative recovery time.\r"

This problem is most frequently seen in the hip joint in two population groups: men near 40 and women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Other joints may be involved and the process may regress in one joint but recur in another. Diagnosis is based on typical clinical and roentgenographic observations including an aspiration of sterile joint fluid. Radioisotope scanning may be helpful. Bone or synovial biopsy sampling is not necessary. Proper management requires accurate diagnosis and conservative treatment of a cooperative patient. Pain may persist for six months or longer. Treatment consists of analgesics, protection against stress fractures, and physical therapy for prevention of contractures.\r"

In eleven cases with concomitant medical compartment osteoarthritis, TTA was combined with high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Patellar pain relief was noted soon after surgery and was sustained in 80% of the patients. Systemic complications included one patient with lethal pulmonary embolus. Local complications occurred as follows: three patients had severe local necrosis of skin, which required a rotation skin flap in two. In one patient, the bone graft displaced, and in two patients, nonunion of this graft was noted. Following appropriate treatment in these six patients their final rating was excellent in two, good in three, and poor in one. Contrary to other reports in the literature, the combination of HTO and TTA was as successful as the Maquet procedure alone. TTA is an important procedure for severe patellofemoral arthritis after all other methods of conservative treatment have been exhausted and no other surgical procedure is clearly indicated.\r"

At 90 degrees of flexion, there were no significant differences in stiffness or laxity between the patient groups. At 20 degrees of flexion and neutral foot rotation, the meniscal substitution group had an average of 1.4 mm less side-to-side laxity difference than the partial meniscectomy patients; 51% of the substituted patients still had an injured knee laxity that was at least 2 mm greater than the uninjured knee, as contrasted to 67% of the partial meniscectomy patients who exceeded this upper limit of the normal range. At 20 degrees, anterior stiffness of the injured knees of the substitution patients was 28% greater than the injured knees of the partial meniscectomy group; 42% of the substituted patients had an injured knee stiffness within the normal range, while only 18% of the partial meniscectomy patients fell within normal limits. There were no statistical correlations of stiffness or laxity values with clinical scores or patient symptomatology in either group.\r"

The viscoelastic properties of Sorbothane were investigated by Durometer tests at various temperatures as well as compression tests of thin discs of material with different degrees of lateral constraints and varying rates of loading. Sorbothane has the characteristics of a viscoelastic solid with a relaxation time of two seconds. The effects of lateral constraint were significant, indicating that the properties of this material will change when bonded to other substances in the production of insoles.

Healing bone units were assessed microscopically and mechanically. Significantly greater forces (p less than 0.01) were required to break those bone units exposed to magnetic fields. However, no significant difference was found when comparing the longitudinal midcallus areas from magnetized and nonmagnetized limbs.\r"

The resulting imbalance in the elderly may produce an increased vascular resistance from the unopposed alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in the peripheral vasculature. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied 12 healthy elderly and 12 healthy young subjects during a graded infusion of epinephrine and compared blood pressure response, vascular resistance, and calf blood flow as determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. In both groups, heart rate increased, blood flow to the leg increased, and vascular resistance fell in response to epinephrine infusion, but in the elderly the systolic blood pressure failed to rise as it did in the young subjects. From these data we conclude that the overall vascular response to epinephrine does not change with age and that the balance between beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation and alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is therefore unchanged in the elderly.\r"

Single oral doses of racemic warfarin, 1.5 mg/kg, were administered to six normal subjects, with and without oral amiodarone, 400 mg daily, for the hypoprothrombinemic duration. Both the hypoprothrombinemia (P less than 0.001) and plasma warfarin concentrations (P less than 0.01) were significantly increased. The experiments were repeated separately with the R- and S-warfarin enantiomorphs. S-warfarin with amiodarone significantly increased both the hypoprothrombinemia (P less than 0.001) and plasma warfarin concentrations (P less than 0.01). R-warfarin with amiodarone significantly increased both the hypoprothrombinemia (P less than 0.001) and plasma warfarin concentrations (P less than 0.001). Thus amiodarone augmented the anticoagulant effect nonstereoselectively by reduced metabolic clearance of both warfarin enantiomorphs. Amiodarone and racemic warfarin can be a dangerous combination, particularly when either drug is added to a stabilized regimen of the other drug, unless the prothrombin times are monitored carefully.\r"

There was an approximately linear relationship between dose and the AUC. Urinary sodium, chloride, and potassium excretion rates indicated that the peak diuretic activity corresponded with peak plasma drug concentrations and probably continued for 12 to 24 hours. There was little difference between the total sodium and chloride output after each dose of clopamide, suggesting that 5 mg may have been close to the top of the dose-response curve. Chlorothiazide, 500 mg, caused less sodium and chloride output with similar potassium loss. During chronic administration to patients with hypertension, hypokalemia was more marked with clopamide, 10 mg daily, than with clopamide, 5 mg, or chlorothiazide, 500 mg daily.\r"

Blood samples were analyzed for propafenone and warfarin concentrations and the effect of each treatment on the prothrombin time was assessed. The concurrent administration of warfarin did not produce any changes in the absorption or disposition kinetics of propafenone. Concurrent propafenone administration did lead to a reduction in the clearance of warfarin, resulting in an average increase of 38% in the mean steady-state plasma warfarin concentration. During the combined therapy phase, the prothrombin time increased significantly (P less than 0.01) from the \"warfarin alone\" phase. We conclude from this study that the concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin may lead to an enhanced anticoagulant effect that may require a reduction in the warfarin dose.\r"

Phenprocoumon and the 7-hydroxymetabolite represented the major materials recovered. All drug-related materials excreted into the urine were extensively conjugated. Sulfinpyrazone treatment did not affect the hypoprothrombinemia produced by phenprocoumon nor did it significantly alter the plasma elimination kinetics of the individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. However, an apparent increased free fraction of both enantiomers in plasma and inhibition of 7-hydroxylation of (S)-phenprocoumon were observed in the presence of sulfinpyrazone. The results of this study are contrasted with those of a previous study on the interaction between sulfinpyrazone and the structurally similar coumarin anticoagulant warfarin.\r"

Particular attention was paid to rapid blood and urine sample processing to avoid drug losses. Patients were catheterized for urine collections. During and after infusion, plasma levels of unbound cisplatin were simultaneously fitted to a one-compartment model. Creatinine clearance was determined at the same time as cisplatin renal clearance and was 38 +/- 16 ml/min/m2. Total clearance of unbound cisplatin was 253 +/- 48 ml/min/m2 and volume of distribution was 11.5 +/- 2.7 L/m2. Cisplatin half-life was similar when determined from plasma (31.6 +/- 6.0 minutes) or urinary excretion rate data (24.4 +/- 4.0 minutes). Urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 23.3% +/- 8.6% of the dose and renal clearance 56.9 +/- 18.0 ml/min/m2. Renal clearance exceeded creatinine clearance in all patients ratio = 1.9 +/- 1.2), confirming previous suggestions of active renal tubular secretion of cisplatin. Renal clearance was nonlinear with time in two of the patients who received the 2-hour infusion, possibly reflecting changing renal tubular reabsorption. Pharmacokinetic studies of unchanged cisplatin rather than total platinum are therefore practical and could be pursued in further studies defining cisplatin disposition in patients.\r"

The total recovery of metabolites as percentage of given dose and the metabolite profiles in urine were similar for the two debrisoquin hydroxylator phenotypes. Similarly, no differences were observed between the groups with respect to stereoselective production of either dihydrodiol or para-phenolic metabolites of phenytoin. The debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype was also investigated in 74 epileptic patients treated with phenytoin. Vmax and Km were graphically estimated from plasma concentrations at varying phenytoin dosage regimens in 36 of the patients. There was no correlation between the debrisoquin hydroxylation index and Vmax or Km. We conclude that the debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype has no predictive value in guiding phenytoin dosage.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of theophylline clearance by phenytoin was investigated in 12 young male subjects (six nonsmokers and six cigarette smokers). Each subject received intravenous theophylline to determine baseline pharmacokinetics. This was followed by an intravenous loading dose of phenytoin sodium and oral maintenance dosing for 2 weeks, after which the intravenous theophylline study was repeated. Phenytoin concentrations were similar in nonsmokers (10.8 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml) and smokers (11.5 +/- 0.9 micrograms/ml). Control theophylline elimination half-life was 35% less and clearance 88% greater in smokers than in nonsmokers. The proportionate changes in half-life (26.8% +/- 5.6% in smokers and 25.8% +/- 3.5% in nonsmokers) and clearance (48.0% +/- 10.1% in smokers and 39.7% +/- 7.2% in nonsmokers) as the result of phenytoin induction were similar in both groups. These results demonstrate that the induction of theophylline clearance by phenytoin is additive to that caused by cigarette smoking and provide support for the suggestion that theophylline metabolism is influenced by multiple polymorphisms.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of a major metabolite of quinidine in humans, quinidine-N-oxide, were investigated after single oral doses (3 to 15 mg) in four healthy subjects. The concentration in serum and urine was determined by an HPLC assay. Because of a small volume of distribution, the elimination half-life of quinidine-N-oxide was only 2.5 +/- 0.28 hours (mean +/- SD), considerably shorter than that of quinidine. The renal clearance was 1.3 +/- 0.3 L/hr. Only 13.9% +/- 3.7% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged compound for up to 12 hours. Two unidentified compounds with the same retention time as quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine were found in the urine samples of two subjects. The free fraction in serum was 3.3% +/- 0.83%. No systematic changes in heart rate-corrected QT interval were observed up to concentrations of 500 ng/ml. The results indicate that quinidine-N-oxide, in contrast to 3-hydroxyquinidine, does not possess quinidine-like pharmacologic activity.\r"

Because this clinical observation suggests a low-grade state of diffuse intravascular coagulation, standard clinical coagulation assays, platelet counts, and plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels were measured in patients before and during treatment with AHA. Coagulation assays, fibrinogen, and fibrin-split products were not significantly different when pretreatment and treatment values were compared. FPA levels were significantly elevated and platelet counts were significantly reduced in the treatment period, indicating augmented thrombin activity and consumption of platelets into thrombi or platelet microaggregates. FPA levels were elevated within 24 hours of the initiation of AHA therapy whereas platelet counts did not change significantly within the first 4 days of treatment. The data are consistent with low-grade intravascular coagulation with AHA treatment and suggest that patients treated with this agent should be observed cautiously for signs of thrombosis.\r"

Nickel allergy is a health problem. It may be minimized by using nickel alloys with a corrosion level below 0.5 microgram/cm2/week. Action should be taken by dermatologists, industry and authorities to solve this neglected problem.\r"

Dodecyl gallate belongs with propyl- and octyl-gallate to the synthetic esters of gallic acid. These lipid-soluble phenols are very effective antioxidants. We found contact allergy in 4 of 10 workers having only limited contact with dodecyl gallate in the very low concentration of 0.05%. It is important to recognize its strong sensitizing capacity. Workers working with dodecyl gallate should avoid direct skin contact.\r"

Sections showed features of contact dermatitis. There were many dendritic cells located perivascularly in the papilla and in the epidermidis, intensely positive for monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. In control atopic subjects, there were a few perivascular IgE positive cells, probably mastocytes. This study shows that there may be a relationship between some allergens and atopic eczema in patients exposed to them in the course of their work. In some cases, there was a true allergic contact dermatitis, seen through the clinical and histological characteristics, and the results of immunohistochemical study.\r"

Their mean oxygen consumption (VO2) during controlled ventilation (CV) was 292 +/- 21 (SEM) ml/min. During spontaneous ventilation (SV) through endotracheal tube and ventilator circuit, the VO2 rose significantly (p less than .001) to 323 +/- 20 ml/min. The oxygen cost of breathing (OCB) (the difference in VO2 between CV and SV) and the OCB as a fraction of the oxygen consumed during SV (OCB/VO2 SV) both correlated significantly by linear regression analysis with the total time to wean in days (-11.6 + 0.93 for OCB, r = .79; and -12.6 + 293.1 for OCB/VO2 SV, r = .84, p less than .001 for both). As the OCB was correlated with the total wean time, this variable may be a useful index of the effect of many influences on the weaning process.\r"

Since ultrafilterable calcium and magnesium values approximate ionized levels, we evaluated the accuracy of ultrafilterable levels in critically ill patients. Ultrafilterable serum calcium concentrations were sensitive (95%) and specific (93%) in predicting ionized hypocalcemia. Total serum calcium values were sensitive (93%) but lacked specificity (50%) in predicting ionized hypocalcemia. Total serum magnesium concentrations were sensitive (100%) but not specific (73%) in predicting ultrafilterable hypomagnesemia. We conclude that ultrafilterable calcium concentrations offer an alternative to ionized calcium measurements when an ion-selective electrode is not available. In addition, ultrafilterable magnesium levels may reflect more accurately the true ionized magnesium concentrations than total serum magnesium values.\r"

The k2 values of critically ill patients were similar to those of healthy subjects. However, the initial plasma concentrations of Intralipid calculated by extrapolation to zero-time (y0) were markedly different. The mean y0 value in the critically ill patients was 43% that of healthy subjects. No plasma loss of 125I albumin occurred throughout the test. Intralipid to 125I albumin plasma concentration ratios during the removal phase paralleled the curves obtained from the iv fat tolerance test. This suggests that these ratios depend on Intralipid clearance rather than leakage from the circulation. The immediate loss of Intralipid suggests that the pulmonary vasculature, the first capillary bed through which the emulsion passes, could be the site where a substantial uptake of the emulsion occurs in critically ill patients.\r"

Eight of the nine remaining patients were placed on ECMO support with HOFV. Infants who responded to HFOV alone tended to have pneumonia more than meconium aspiration, to be smaller and more immature, to have higher Apgar scores, and to have suffered severe hypoxia (alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference over 600 torr) for less time than the ECMO group. Although patient numbers are small, a trend is noted which favors HFOV treatment alone in terms of the duration of HFOV, the total duration of assisted ventilation, the rapidity with which extubation was accomplished, and the length of hospital stay.\r"

Six (18%) of 33 patients after elective operations developed transient sigmoid ischemia identified by the development of acidosis in the sigmoid colon wall on the day of operation and the appearance of guaiac-positive liquid stool a few days after the surgery. Three patients developed infections from intestinal organisms, all of whom had an antecedent episode of sigmoid ischemia (p less than .004, Fisher's exact test). The degree of acidosis in the wall of the sigmoid colon on the day of surgery was greater (p less than .004) and the duration longer (p less than .004) in these patients than in the others. The duration of sigmoid ischemia was the best predictor of infection (p less than .0001). These data are consistent with the hypothesis in question.\r"

Post-traumatic development of cerebral microthromboses seems to be a major feature. To test this hypothesis, we subjected Wistar rats with postburn ARDS to the following microneurosurgical procedures in an attempt to morphologically detect modifications in the evolving pattern: a) anterior (AH) or posterior (PH) hypothalamus nuclei stereotaxic electrolytic lesion; b) intracerebroventricular microinjections of phenoxybenzamine (PB)-50, micrograms propranolol-0.5 micrograms, cocaine-5 micrograms, epinephrine-0.5 micrograms, carbachol(CA)-5 micrograms, pirilamine-20 micrograms, cimetidine-30 micrograms, lidocaine-20 micrograms, atropine (AT)-40 micrograms; c) intra-AH microinjections of CA-10 micrograms, AT-20 micrograms; and d) intra-PH microinjections of PB-10 micrograms, norepinephrine-0.05 microgram. The results showed that the alpha-adrenergic components of PH induce a potentiation in ARDS whereas the cholinergic components of AH seem to attenuate this syndrome. This work suggests that a damaged CNS may suffer cybernetic derangements as to induce it to generate inappropriate adaptative responses that can result in the development of ARDS.\r"

The mean difference between the two measurements was 0.51 L/min with an SD greater than 1.6 L/min, reflecting the scattering of results. The overall correlation coefficient was .58. The intercepts were large and the regression equation some way from the line of equal values (TDCO = 2.28 + 0.66 PDCO). When the results were analyzed according to diagnosis or by group experience, there were some differences in the bias of the estimate; however, the SD of the difference between methods was greater than one liter/min in all groups. Thus, the pulsed Doppler method failed to estimate accurately TDCO in critically ill patients.\r"

One group of dogs (n = 8) were fluid loaded (30 ml/kg dextran-40) after having been subjected to a 2-h Escherichia coli endotoxin infusion (0.25 micrograms/kg X min). A second control group of animals (n = 6) was submitted to a similar (25 ml/kg) volume loading over an equivalent 30-min period. We estimated extravascular lung water (EVLW), calculated the effective pulmonary capillary pressure, and determined the alveolar-capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) after volume loading. Only the septic animals consistently showed elevated EVLW values consistent with pulmonary edema. The results showed, however, that the Kf calculated for the dogs that received endotoxin was no different from that of control group (Kf = 0.005 ml/kg X min X mm Hg). Instead, endotoxin constricted the pulmonary veins which led to a considerable rise in microvascular hydrostatic pressure above the level at which the lungs could not resist edema formation. We conclude that acute pulmonary edema that follows endotoxin insult and subsequent therapeutic volume replacement is due to an increased filtration force instead of an alteration in the microvascular permeability.\r"

This is particularly true when there are anatomical or pathological abnormalities, trauma, or when repeated failed attempts at endoscopic or blind intubations have left a bloody field, preventing clear visualization of the vocal cords. Our refinement of translaryngeal guided intubation (TLI) uses a spring guidewire accompanied by a plastic sheath protector. The wire is introduced percutaneously via a cricothyroid puncture and passed cephalad into the oropharynx or nasopharynx and out through the mouth or one of the nostrils. The plastic sheath is slid over the wire into the trachea. A well-lubricated endotracheal tube is then inserted to the desired position using the plastic sheath as a stylet. This technique works very well, and we are convinced that TLI is one of the most effective emergency techniques to secure an airway. It can be performed quickly with inexpensive equipment and is a promising addition to the currently recommended alternatives.\r"
