  ".W": "A large kindred with colorectal cancer unaccompanied by polyposis coli and characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance has been identified in eastern Canada. Ten family members from three successive generations have presented 17 documented colorectal cancers. The clinical features of the kindred are characteristic of hereditary site-specific colon cancer (HSSCC) (Lynch syndrome I): absence of multiple polyposis, autosomal dominant inheritance, onset of colorectal cancer at an early age and a high incidence of synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancers. A unique feature of this family is the high incidence of sporadic adenomatous polyps in affected members and their relatives. Patients with HSSCC have been managed by means of segmental colectomy followed by annual colonoscopic surveillance. All five patients with localized (Dukes' stage A or B) cancer at initial diagnosis were alive and free of disease after 2 to 12 years of follow-up, although three had required further colonic resection for metachronous carcinomas. Five young family members without cancer have had sporadic adenomatous polyps removed and are being followed with annual colonoscopy. It is not known whether polypectomy will alter the subsequent incidence of colon cancer. Subtotal colectomy is recommended for patients with HSSCC because of the high incidence of multiple lesions. An aggressive screening protocol, including colonoscopy, is recommended for all adult first- and second-degree relatives of patients with HSSCC. Identification of a biomarker, which is currently being sought in this kindred, would help identify those at greatest risk of development of cancer and allow earlier intervention.\r"

The oxygen metabolites produced by hypoxanthine plus xanthine oxidase caused relaxation of the ductus that was inhibited by catalase (hydrogen peroxide scavenger) but not by superoxide dismutase (superoxide anion scavenger). In addition, hypoxanthine plus xanthine oxidase produced a 14-fold increase in prostaglandin (PG) E2 production with only twofold increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2). PGE2 is the most potent relaxant of the ductus arteriosus. The presence of either catalase or indomethacin blocked both the increase in prostaglandin production and the relaxation. We conclude that reactive oxygen metabolites relax the ductus arteriosus and oppose the normal constriction that occurs after birth. However, the vasoactive effects of reactive oxygen metabolites in the ductus appear to be mediated exclusively through the generation of PGE2.\r"

Changes in protein phosphorylation were compared to alterations in tissue cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and positive inotropic effects induced by these agents. Isoproterenol (0.01 microM), milrinone (50 microM), and isobutylmethylxanthine (100 microM) all produced similar, twofold increases in dP/dt and -dP/dt but only stimulation with isobutylmethylxanthine and isoproterenol was associated with significant increases in phospholamban phosphorylation. At these equipotent doses, the effects of isobutylmethylxanthine were associated with higher increases (3.1-fold) in cAMP than those observed with isoproterenol (twofold). Milrinone (50 microM) produced a 2.5-fold increase in cAMP levels but failed to change phospholamban phosphorylation. Higher doses of milrinone (100 microM) resulted in relatively high (4.1-fold) cAMP levels, and this was associated with increased (1.5-fold) phosphorylation of phospholamban. Phosphorylation of troponin I was significantly increased at 0.01 microM and 0.1 microM isoproterenol, while phosphorylation of C protein was observed only at 0.1 microM isoproterenol. Isobutylmethylxanthine and milrinone did not significantly increase phosphorylation of either troponin I or C protein at any of the doses studied. These findings indicate that cardiotonic agents acting via the cAMP pathway may produce similar inotropic responses at different levels of cAMP and phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrillar proteins.\r"

We measured cell flux (using cells labeled with substituted tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate, XRITC) and vessel diameter in adjoining arterioles of the terminal vasculature of hamster cremaster muscle (Nembutal, 70 mg/kg i.p.) during rest and hyperemia (10(-4) M adenosine). In terminal arterioles (TAs), 32 of 68 vessels showed cell flux increases from rest to hyperemia exceeding 25 times (i.e., 47% of TAs were relatively unperfused at rest). In vessels feeding TAs (TAFs), 33 of 95 (34%) were relatively unperfused at rest. Cell flux heterogeneity in TAFs decreased significantly by 27% from rest to hyperemia; the corresponding decrease (16%) in TAs was not significant. Thus, unperfused TAFs are present in a proportion which reflects capillary recruitment in hamster cremaster (Sarelius et al, Am J Physiol 1981;241:H317) while TAs are not, and TAFs independently modulate flow distribution distally while TAs do not. The data therefore support the conclusion that TAFs control cell flow in the distal microvasculature. Analysis of normalized ranked maximal diameters showed that TAFs unperfused at rest tend to be the smaller vessels at any tissue site.\r"

Hypoxic perfusates consisted of methemoglobin-containing red blood cells suspended in lactated Ringer's solution. Brief cross-clamping of the coronary perfusion line was used to assess the contribution of coronary turgor to chamber distensibility and wall thickness. With hypoxia, left ventricles showed a significant early (5 minutes) decrease in diastolic distensibility and an increase in wall thickness, at either constant coronary perfusion pressure or flow. The increase in wall thickness was independent of hypoxia-induced changes in coronary turgor. In contrast, global ischemia produced an early increase in LV diastolic chamber distensibility and a decrease in wall thickness. When global ischemia was continued beyond 60 minutes, a decrease in LV chamber distensibility developed. This diastolic contracture was not associated with an increase in LV wall thickness. Myocardial pH decreased slightly during 15 minutes of hypoxia and markedly with 15 minutes of global ischemia. Thus, LV diastolic chamber distensibility decreased during 15 minutes of hypoxia, while an increase in distensibility was seen during global ischemia of similar duration. During hypoxia, these changes were associated with increased LV wall thickness, at either constant coronary perfusion pressure or constant coronary flow. Prolonged ischemia led to diastolic contracture without an increase in wall thickness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From weeks 5 through 16, systolic pressure was measured via tail plethysmography. While blood pressure rose markedly in sham-operated SHR, increases in pressure were small in AP-ablated SHR and similar to those seen in all WKY. Subsequent direct measurements of mean arterial pressure in the same rats showed a significant correlation (r = 0.87, p less than 0.01) with the pressure data acquired via weekly tail-cuff measurement, thereby confirming that hypertension in AP-ablated SHR had indeed been attenuated. Analysis of several hundred computer-acquired measurements of mean arterial pressure from each rat showed that AP ablation shifted the distribution of mean arterial pressure to a lower range in SHR but not WKY. Ablation of the AP also decreased resting heart rate in SHR but not WKY. Suppression of heart rate in response to intravenous phenylephrine was equivalent in sham-operated and AP-ablated rats, suggesting that baroreflex-mediated slowing of heart rate was not impaired. In response to intravenous angiotensin II, suppression of heart rate was similar in sham and AP-ablated SHR, and actually was enhanced in AP-ablated WKY. Histological evaluation of the lesions indicated that visible damage to the adjacent nuclei of the solitary tracts was confined to a small portion of the commissural nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chloralose-anesthetized piglets were equipped with closed cranial windows over the parietal cortex for observation of pial arterioles and collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) passing over the cerebral surface. Prostanoids in the CSF were determined by radioimmunoassay. LVP (10-1,000 microU/ml) elicited concentration-dependent increases in pial arteriolar diameter associated with increased levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG)F1 alpha, PGE2, thromboxane B2, and PGF2 alpha. LVP-induced pial arteriolar dilation was unchanged after intravenous indomethacin (5 mg/kg). Conversely, LVP constricts pial arterioles previously dilated by physiological (hemorrhagic hypotension) and pharmacological (topically applied PGE2 or isoproterenol) intervention. This constriction is potentiated by indomethacin. Vascular and biochemical changes elicited by LVP were blocked by intravenous [1-(beta-mercapto-beta beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid),2,(O-methyl)-Tyr-AVP] (5 micrograms/kg), a putative V1 receptor antagonist, whereas vascular effects of norepinephrine and U46619, a thromboxane A2 mimic, were unchanged. Therefore, the degree of vascular tone appears to influence responses of the newborn pig cerebral circulation to LVP.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of intracellularly perfused ATP, and extracellularly applied cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, on fast and slow Ca2+ channel currents of isolated single vascular smooth muscle cells were investigated by a whole-cell voltage-clamp method combined with an intracellular perfusion technique. Single smooth muscle cells were prepared by collagenase treatment from guinea pig small mesenteric arteries (diameter of less than 300 micron). With Cs+-rich solution in the pipette and isotonic Ba2+ solution (100 mM) in the bath, depolarizing pulses evoked two types of the Ca2+ channel current. Depolarizing pulses from the holding potential of -80 mV to over -30 mV evoked a fast Ca2+ channel current. This fast component was inhibited by shifting the holding potential in a positive direction. With a holding potential of -40 mV, the fast component was almost inhibited. In contrast, the slow current was evoked by command potentials to above -10 mV, and its full amplitude was preserved at the holding potential of -40 mV. Without ATP in the pipette, the fast current was dominant. Increase in the ATP concentration in the pipette (0.3 to 5 mM) enhanced the slow current but did not affect the fast current. Maximum enhancement of the slow current was observed at 5 mM ATP. Increase in ATP concentration, however, did not modify the shape of the current trace and the steady state inactivation curve of the slow current. Maximum amplitudes of the fast current and slow current recorded with 5 mM ATP averaged 17.4 pA (SD of 10.4 pA, n = 30; observed at -10 mV to +10 mV) and 141.8 pA (SD of 27.1 pA, n = 30; observed at +30 mV to +40 mV), respectively. Presence of CN- and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (without glucose) in the bath, and absence of ATP in the pipette, abolished the slow current within 10 minutes; in contrast, it took more than 10 minutes to depress the fast current. The inhibitory effect of CN- and 2-deoxy-D-glucose on the slow current was reduced by intracellular application of ATP. In summary, the activation of the slow Ca2+ channel required physiological concentration of ATP, whereas the fast channel current was preserved, even under ATP-free conditions. These results indicate that only the slow current is a metabolically dependent Ca2+ channel current in these vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

Of 106 dogs studied, 40 had inducible VT, 19 had inducible VF, and 47 had no inducible arrhythmias. Differences between these three groups of animals were examined with cardiac mapping (to determine ventricular activation time in sinus rhythm) and post-mortem pathology (to measure infarct size and to reconstruct the anatomy at the infarct edge). Animals with inducible VT had longer maximal epicardial activation time (127 +/- 8 msec) than did animals with inducible VF (91 +/- 8 msec, p less than 0.05) or animals with no inducible arrhythmias (75 +/- 2 msec, p less than 0.001). Delayed epicardial activation occurred in 90% of animals with VT, 42% of animals with VF, and in only 6% of animals with no inducible arrhythmias. Endocardial and myocardial activation times were similar for the VT and VF groups. Infarct size was 18 +/- 2% of the ventricles for the VT group, much higher than for the VF group (11 +/- 2%, p less than 0.001) or for the group with no inducible arrhythmias (9 +/- 1%, p less than 0.001). The maximum diameter of viable muscle bundles interdigitating with scar tissue at the infarct edge was much larger in animals with VT (2.4 +/- 0.2 mm) than in animals with VF (1.8 +/- 0.2 mm, p less than 0.05) or animals with no inducible arrhythmias (1.7 +/- 0.1 mm, p less than 0.01). Thus, when compared with animals with inducible VF, animals with inducible VT had longer epicardial activation time, larger infarct size and viable muscle bundles of larger diameter at the infarct edge.\r"

We measured pulmonary artery, left atrial, and systemic pressures by direct catheterization and cardiac output by the thermodilution technique. For micropuncture, we stabilized the lung on a shelf and stopped ventilation for 3-4 minutes at an airway pressure of 7 cm H2O. We injected pancuronium intravenously to paralyze the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Of the total pulmonary vascular pressure drop, 52% occurred in the microvascular segment between arterioles and venules of 20 micron diameter, 28% occurred in the arterial segment, and 20% occurred in the venous segment. We conclude that in the intact lung of rabbit, the major pressure drop occurs in the microvascular segment.\r"

J Biol Chem 1985;260:7295) has demonstrated a novel catabolic pathway that potentially contributes to the accumulation of amphiphilic metabolites during myocardial ischemia. To assess the potential importance of this pathway, we quantified the temporal course of alterations in myocardial 1-0-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (AAG) and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) content during control and ischemic intervals in an isolated perfused Langendorf model. AAG accumulated over fivefold to 8.70 and 18.27 nmol/g dry in 20- and 60-minute ischemic rabbit hearts, respectively (p less than 0.02). The only AAG molecular species that was detected in substantial amounts in control or ischemic rabbit hearts was 1-0-hexadec-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol. Since this molecular species is enriched in plasmenylcholine these findings suggest that AAG production is likely mediated by phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of plasmenylcholine. In contrast to ischemia-induced AAG accumulation, DAG content decreased during both control and globally ischemic perfusion intervals. In summary, these findings demonstrate that AAG, in contrast to DAG, accumulates during myocardial ischemia indicating that at least some metabolites of plasmalogen and diacyl phospholipids accumulate at differential rates during myocardial ischemia.\r"

In this study, the appearance and distribution of endothelial cell microfilaments in the rabbit thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta and its major arterial branch points, and the aortic bifurcation were examined. Perfusion fixed rabbit aortas were stained in situ for F-actin by infusing rhodamine phalloidin via a peristaltic pump into the aortas at a slow flow rate. This new technique resulted in excellent visualization of branch points and allowed for a precise description of the actin microfilament bundles in endothelial cells along flow dividers. In the thoracic and abdominal aorta, away from branch ostia, actin microfilaments were localized in two regions of the endothelial cells, as a prominent band that completely outlined the cell periphery, and also as short central stress fibers. The central stress fibers were more frequent and prominent in cells of the abdominal aorta. At branch sites and at the aortic bifurcation, long, thick microfilament bundles were present in endothelial cells extending from the tip of the flow divider to a few millimeters along the branch arteries, the aorta, and the iliac arteries. Peripheral actin, however, no longer completely surrounded the cells. The thick bundles were not prominent in endothelial cells located adjacent to the proximal lip of branches or at the iliac arteries opposite the flow divider. This study shows that endothelial cell F-actin microfilament distribution in vivo is well defined along the aortic-arterial system. The prominent central microfilament bundles and the reduced peripheral microfilaments seen at localized regions may reflect an adaptive response to elevated shear stress at these sites.\r"

To examine if coronary vasodilator reserve is reduced following coronary occlusion-reperfusion in intact animals, 16 open-chest mongrel dogs were subjected to 1 hour of total left circumflex (Cx) coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 1 hour. Prior to Cx occlusion, coronary blood flow increased and vascular resistance decreased (both p less than or equal to 0.01) in response to ACh and bradykinin (BK). Following reperfusion, increase in Cx coronary flow in response to both vasodilators was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) impaired. Myocardial histology showed extensive neutrophil infiltration and capillary plugging by neutrophils in the Cx compared with the left anterior descending coronary artery-supplied myocardium. Myocardial myeloperoxidase activity was also increased in the Cx compared with the left anterior descending region (p less than or equal to 0.02). Pretreatment of four dogs with indomethacin partially reduced the vasodilator response to BK but not to ACh. However, indomethacin did not affect reperfusion-induced attenuation of BK or ACh's coronary vasodilator effects. To determine if calcium blocker verapamil would modify reperfusion-induced impairment in coronary vasodilator reserve, six dogs were treated with verapamil. Although verapamil enhanced coronary vasodilator effects of ACh and BK, it did not modify reperfusion-induced attenuation of coronary vasodilator reserve. Myocardial neutrophil accumulation and myeloperoxidase activity was also similar in control, indomethacin, and verapamil-treated dogs. These observations suggest that coronary reperfusion impairs coronary vasodilator reserve in intact dogs. This impairment is not modified by prostaglandin inhibition or by calcium blockade. Besides loss of EDRF, capillary plugging by neutrophils may contribute to the altered coronary flow reserve observed in the immediate post-reperfusion period. Furthermore, indomethacin or verapamil are not effective in modifying the reperfusion-related impairment of coronary vasodilator reserve.\r"

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) coexists with adrenaline and noradrenaline in the rat brain, and interactions among these substances have been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of NPY in central cardiovascular control. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane, and blood pressure was monitored intra-arterially. Intramedullary microinjection (60 nl) of NPY (0, 46.5 fmol, 465 fmol, 1.5 pmol, and 4.65 pmol) was made into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), into the area postrema, and into the C1 area in the rostroventrolateral medulla. Injection site was identified by L-glutamate administration and confirmed histologically. Unilateral injection of NPY into the NTS produced a prominent dose-related decrease in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-106 +/- 8 beats/min, -56 +/- 2 mm Hg, and -33 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively after 4.65 pmol NPY, n = 7, p less than 0.001). Maximal changes occurred at 30 seconds and recovered in 10 minutes for blood pressure and 20 minutes for heart rate.

  ".U": "89077714\r", 
  ".W": "Exposure of adult mammalian myocardium to increased hemodynamic loads augments cardiac protein synthesis, ultimately leading to hypertrophy of the affected chamber. This established relationship between loading conditions and protein synthesis was examined in terms of two questions. First, is there a basic difference between the anabolic effect of a passive load imposed on diastolic myocardium and that of an active load generated by systolic myocardium? This issue was addressed by measuring [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into muscle protein in either quiescent or contracting ferret papillary muscles, set at known isometric lengths. Myocardial protein synthesis increased in proportion to total muscle tension in each case, with an equivalent relation describing both quiescent and contracting muscles. Synthesis of two contractile proteins, actin and myosin heavy chain, were enhanced by muscle loading. Thus, a quantitative rather than qualitative difference between the anabolic effects of diastolic and systolic loading was demonstrated. Second, since increased sodium influx is an initial cellular response requisite to the growth-inducing activity of many substances, and since sodium entry through stretch-activated ion channels is stimulated by deformation of the sarcolemma, does cardiac deformation during increased loading promote sodium influx as a signal to increase anabolic activity? In either quiescent or contracting papillary muscles, the rate of 24Na+ uptake was found to increase with load. Streptomycin, a cationic blocker of the mechanotransducer ion channels, was without effect on protein synthesis in stimulated but slack muscles; however, it inhibited, in a dose-related manner, the augmented protein synthesis otherwise observed in contracting muscles developing tension. At 500 microM, streptomycin did not reduce active tension, but it did reduce the synthesis of both actin and myosin heavy chain. In a second pharmacologic approach, inotropic agents were chosen which uniformly increased muscle tension development but which had contrasting effects on sodium influx. Protein synthesis increased in the presence of Na+ influx enhancers, monensin or veratridine; however, protein synthesis decreased in the presence of amiloride, a sodium influx inhibitor. Thus, myocardial protein synthesis varied directly with sodium influx despite the positive inotropic effect observed with each of these agents. In addition, inhibition of protein synthesis by ouabain demonstrated that activation of the Na+ pump is required for the anabolic effect of load.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Do oxygen-derived free radicals, generated at the time of reperfusion, lethally injure viable, previously ischemic myocardium, damage vascular endothelium, and impair recovery of postischemic contractile function? To address these issues, 23 anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 2 hours of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. Immediately prior to reflow, each dog was randomized to receive either the free radical scavenging agents superoxide dismutase (SOD) + catalase, or saline alone. SOD + catalase had no significant beneficial effect on infarct size measured by triphenyltetrazolium staining: area of necrosis averaged 38.5 +/- 6.1% vs. 46.3 +/- 6.2% of the area at risk in treated compared with control animals respectively (p = NS). Furthermore, infusion of SOD + catalase did not alter contractile function of the viable subepicardium: mean segment shortening (measured using sonomicrometry) at 4 hours postreperfusion was -23 +/- 5% of baseline, preocclusion values in controls dogs and -24 +/- 9% of preocclusion values in animals that received the scavenging agents. However, SOD + catalase treatment preserved the endocardial microvasculature (assessed by semiquantitative electron microscopic analysis) and enhanced regional myocardial blood flow after reperfusion. Specifically, mean score for microvascular injury was 0.41 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.05) in control compared with SOD + catalase treated groups, and blood flow averaged 0.56 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.33 ml/min/g tissue (p less than 0.05), respectively, in the previously ischemic endocardium at 2 hours postreflow. Thus, SOD + catalase given at the time of reperfusion had no acute beneficial effect on either the extent of myocyte necrosis or postischemic contractile function in this canine model. SOD + catalase did, however, attenuate both endocardial vascular injury and the \"low reflow\" phenomenon. These data suggest that microvascular injury and low reflow following prolonged (2 hour) but transient coronary occlusion may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals generated at the time of reperfusion.\r"

Left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow and oxygen extraction, aortic and left ventricular pressures, and regional myocardial segment shortening were determined. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with microspheres. Coronary reactive hyperemia and vasodilator reserve, and regional myocardial oxygen consumption were determined. Three sequential 10-minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions separated by 30-minute reperfusion periods resulted in progressive postischemic dysfunction so that 1 hour after the final coronary artery occlusion, myocardial segment shortening was reduced to 37% of baseline. Despite this decrease in contractile function, left anterior descending artery flow (19.6 +/- 2.6 vs. 18.4 +/- 3.0 ml/min), myocardial blood flow and the transmural distribution of flow measured with microspheres, and regional myocardial oxygen consumption were unchanged. Although the coronary vasodilator reserve in response to adenosine was unaltered (63 +/- 9 vs. 70 +/- 15 ml/min), the reactive hyperemia response to a 10-second coronary occlusion was decreased in intensity (debt repayment ratio = 474 +/- 78% vs. 322 +/- 74%; p less than 0.05) and duration (57 +/- 9.1 vs. 35 +/- 4.5 seconds; p less than 0.05), while the peak flow response was unchanged (57 +/- 6.8 vs. 60 +/- 7.1 ml/min). Thus, in the intact awake animal postischemic myocardial contractile dysfunction was not associated with decreased myocardial oxygen consumption and did not impair the normal relation between coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen utilization. Although coronary vessels showed a normal ability to vasodilate in response to adenosine, coronary reactive hyperemia was reduced.\r"

We examined the possible role of altered humoral immunity by comparing the effect of sera from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 20), ischemic or valvular heart disease (n = 28), or controls with no known cardiac disease (n = 18) on the binding of radioligands to cardiac beta-receptors. The ability of sera from cardiomyopathic patients to inhibit the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to rat cardiac membranes was significantly higher than that of the other two patient groups (40 +/- 5% at 50-fold serum dilution compared to 14 +/- 3% for the ischemic/valvular heart disease group, and 14 +/- 4% for the normal control group, p less than 0.001). A similar inhibition was exerted by IgG from cardiomyopathic patients. Only the number, not the affinity, of the beta-receptors was decreased by cardiomyopathic sera. This decrease could be prevented by preincubating the sera with anti-human IgG, indicating the presence of autoantibodies. Furthermore, the sera were ineffective against cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors and considerably less effective against lung beta 2-receptors. In addition to ligand binding inhibition, sera from cardiomyopathic patients could immunoprecipitate beta-adrenoceptors quantitatively from solubilized cardiac membranes. Positive sera inhibited significantly isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase with no effect on basal or NaF-stimulated activities. These results document the presence in sera from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy of autoantibodies directed against the cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor which may play an important role in the regulation of inotropic responsiveness to beta-agonists.\r"

Nine patients had pacemaker rhythms and 19 patients had an RBBB on their precatheterization ECGs and therefore were excluded from analysis. In the remaining 279 pulmonary artery catheterizations, eight (3%) were associated with the development of a new RBBB. None of the 14 patients with a pre-existing LBBB developed complete heart block. The incidence of complete heart block during pulmonary artery catheterization of patients with previous LBBB was not higher than the incidence of RBBB in patients without underlying conduction defects. Because of the rare but grave consequences of RBBB in patients with pre-existing LBBB, we recommend the use of standby external pacemakers and equipment for transvenous pacemaker insertion in these patients during pulmonary artery catheterization.

We examined the mathematical relationships between vascular tone and flow, and oxygen utilization and oxygen delivery (DO2) in the early and middle stages of cardiogenic and septic shock. The fitted curves between cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance, and oxygen consumption (VO2) and DO2 were clinically and statistically similar in both shock populations. We found no evidence for decreased oxygen extraction in sepsis as compared to the cardiogenic shock population. In addition, it appears that the major determinant of VO2 in these populations is DO2, not oxygen extraction. We suggest that patients with cardiogenic or septic shock can be treated according to similar physiologic principles.\r"

After modifying the PSI to reflect neonatal physiology, we found that PSI scores correlated significantly with TISS values (r = .75, p less than .001) and Nursing Utilization Management Intervention System (NUMIS) classifications (r = .62, p less than .001). TISS values also correlated with NUMIS scores (r = .72, p less than .001). PSI and TISS scores increased significantly with each increase in NUMIS classification (p less than .001 for all comparisons). PSI and TISS scores decreased significantly between admission and either discharge (n = 41) or day 14 of hospitalization (n = 14, p less than .001). PSI and TISS scores were greater on days 1 and 5 in infants with hyaline membrane disease when compared with infants with transient tachypnea (p less than .001). Infants with PSI scores greater than or equal to 4 and TISS scores greater than or equal to 7 on day 1 took significantly longer to achieve adequate protein-calorie intakes than infants with lower first-day scores (p less than .002). The modified PSI and the TISS scoring systems are both useful objective measurements of the degree of physiologic instability in newborn infants requiring intensive care, and both scores identify those at increased risk for nutritional morbidity.\r"

The aim of the study was to provide prophylaxis for stress-induced gastric ulceration by elevating the gastric pH to at least 3.5. Two infusion regimes of ranitidine were compared: 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg.h. The period of study was from induction of anesthesia until the end of the first 24 h after surgery. Both regimes were effective. The 0.2-mg/kg.h infusion produced a significantly higher plasma concentration of ranitidine throughout the study period without any additional clinical benefit. Both regimes produced, within 3 h of cessation of CPB, a significant elevation in mean gastric pH to at least 5.3. This paper concludes that 0.1-mg/kg.h infusion of ranitidine is a safe and efficacious regime for the critically ill pediatric patient.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine has been suggested as an important mediator of the cardiovascular abnormalities during septic shock. To determine if blood histamine levels were increased during human sepsis and septic shock, plasma histamine was measured using a very sensitive radioenzyme assay employing histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) in the following patient groups: normal controls (n = 76), nonseptic critically ill (n = 12), nonseptic shock (n = 2), sepsis without shock (n = 28), and septic shock (n = 41). Using this enzyme binding assay, all these groups had similar, normal plasma histamine concentrations, except those patients with septic shock whose mean histamine measurements were significantly reduced (p less than .002). This decrease was found to be due to an artifact of the assay: plasma contained a circulating inhibitor that falsely lowered the measured histamine level. Fractionation of septic shock plasma using molecular exclusion membranes and gel filtration revealed a 5000 MW inhibitory factor. After removal of this inhibitor from plasma, septic shock plasma histamine levels were normal. Thus, septic shock patients may have a circulating inhibitor of the HNMT enzyme, but plasma histamine concentrations are normal. Histaminemia is unlikely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of septic shock in humans.\r"

Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were studied; the animals were subjected to hemorrhage and then resuscitated using lactated Ringer's solution, with either placebo or pentoxifylline added by random selecting. Animals were then observed for 3 days. There was significantly increased survival in pentoxifylline-treated animals (p less than .05). In additional experiments, animals received more aggressive fluid resuscitation; improved survival in the pentoxifylline group was noted almost immediately and persisted through the 72-h period. This was significant at the p less than .01 level. We conclude that pentoxifylline improves survival from hemorrhagic shock in this experimental model, and has additive survival value to fluid resuscitation.\r"

The rat restraint model of gastric mucosal injury is more analogous to clinical stress ulceration than are models using intragastric application of toxic solutions; however, previous use of prostaglandin E1 in the restraint model resulted in a prohibitive incidence of GI morbidity. The current study used the restraint model of stress ulceration to compare the effects of a more potent prostaglandin analogue, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, with hyperosmolar glucose and antacids. All three agents afforded significant protection from grossly apparent mucosal lesions, alone and in combination. Although other physiologic effects of each agent differed, the only effect which correlated with prevention of mucosal lesions was suppression of gastric acidity. Since effective doses of cytoprotective prostaglandins did not produce notable morbidity in comparison with other agents, they may prove to be a useful adjunct to stress ulcer prophylaxis in clinical settings.\r"

In six pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chested dogs, we inserted a cannula into the left lower lobe bronchus. After 30 min of HFOV at 5 Hz (fistula closed), they received four periods of HFOV (fistula open) at frequencies of 5, 10, 15, and 20 Hz. With the fistula open, we could adequately ventilate at all four frequencies. Vleak ranged between 5.1 +/- 0.7 and 4.1 +/- 0.7 L/min and it was not significantly different at any frequency by analysis of variance. Airway opening pressure (Pao) was 3.9 +/- 0.6 cm H2O with the fistula closed. Pao decreased significantly to 1.9 +/- 0.2 cm H2O during 5 Hz ventilation (fistula open). Pao at the other frequencies was similar to fistula-closed ventilation. We believe that expiratory flow limitation at frequencies greater than 5 Hz may explain our findings.\r"

A noninvasive technique for assessing cardiac output routinely in the critically ill neonate would facilitate clinical management. Impedance cardiography (IC) is a noninvasive technique which measures stroke volume on a beat-by-beat basis. This study compared cardiac output as measured by thermodilution (TD) to that measured by IC in seven canine pups 6 to 7 days old weighing 0.66 to 0.86 kg. Cardiac output was altered by the withdrawal and reinfusion of blood. There were no significant differences between the two methods for either the absolute value of cardiac output (r = .96) or the percent change in cardiac output (r = .97). Coefficients of variation were 3.0% for TD and 3.6% for IC. These results indicate that IC can be used to assess serially cardiac function in the newborn.\r"

The reliability of one monitor was equally good both in a normal and low perfusion mode (i.e., when the monitor displayed a low-quality signal message). The use of locally applied vasodilating creme widened the physiologic limits within which reliable measurements could be obtained. All oximeters and sensors overestimated slightly the saturation as compared to the hemoximeter readings, possibly because of a high mean carboxyhemoglobin concentration that was found to be present.\r"

Compared with the test without a mask, a statistically significant reduction in the rise of temperature, WBCs, HR, R, TLC, and PO2 was observed. Compared with the initial values, a statistically significant reduced increase of temperature and leukocytes was demonstrated in the test using the mask. Pulmonary and systemic alterations were significantly reduced but not completely prevented by the application of the particle-filtering half mask.\r"

The specific hormonal alteration during menses that affects the assay is unknown. However, estrogenic medication administered without progesterone to postmenopausal heterozygous women also caused false-negative tests, suggesting that a balance between progesterone and estrogen is critical for the CF-lectin activity; mere depletion of these hormones alone does not interfere. The addition of estrogen in vitro also inhibited the CF-lectin activity at a physiologic concentration of 10(-6) M, and addition of an equivalent concentration of progesterone blocked this inhibitory effect. Future studies of the CF-lectin or its assay as a potential CF-carrier test must be limited to those women not menstruating at the time of blood drawing and not receiving estrogens. Hemolysis or contamination of the serum with RBC should invalidate that sample for testing, although the effect of RBC contamination can be circumvented with the addition of mannose. A more objective, simplified means of performing the CF-lectin assay is reported. A preliminary blind study taking these issues into consideration was 100 percent correct in detecting 16 CF patients and 17 obligate heterozygotes, and revealed 4 percent of 64 control subjects to have positive tests. The presence of this lectin-like factor may reflect the underlying biochemical defect responsible for this disease.\r"

Many laboratories use data obtained with a spirometer not directly linked to the plethysmograph to calculate total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) from thoracic gas volume (Vtg) measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) in the plethysmograph. The reliability of these calculations depends on the stability of FRC between these separate devices. We examined the differences in TLC and RV values calculated with linked and unlinked spirometers in 220 patients and found them statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Additionally, differences exceeding the 95 percent confidence intervals for repeated, linked determinations occurred in more than 5 percent of patients. The large-volume differences in TLC were often associated with differences in expiratory reserve volume (ERV) in the opposite direction, suggesting a shift in FRC. However, clinical diagnoses were infrequently (4/220) altered by these differences, and recognition of the shift in FRC should further reduce this error. Therefore, the unlinked method appears acceptable.\r"

Since the exercise ST segment response has low specificity in predicting CAD in women, we examined additional exercise parameters in 200 women with a history of chest pain compatible with angina and having ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm recorded during a Bruce treadmill test. All subsequently had coronary arteriography. Two groups were compared: group A (n = 80) with CAD (greater than or equal to 70 percent stenosis of one or more coronary artery) and group B (n = 120) with angiographically confirmed normal coronary arteries (normal or minimal placquing). The exercise criteria analyzed included: (1) chest pain during exercise, (2) percent target heart rate, (3) extent of ST shift, (4) morphology of the ST segment slope, (5) time to normalization of the ST segment, and (6) total exercise duration. Multivariate analysis (using a stepwise logistic regression model) identified four independent exercise variables associated with the likelihood of CAD: (absence of MVP, p = .003; exercise duration less than 5 min, p = .02; ability to reach target heart rate, p = .027; time to ST normalization greater than or equal to 6 min, p less than .001). False positive exercise test results were more likely to occur when the following exercise test variables were present: ability to exercise to stage 3 of the Bruce protocol and a rapid (less than or equal to 4 minutes) normalization of ST shift after cessation of exercise. Attention to these additional exercise variables allows more careful selection of women requiring more definitive (and expensive) testing.\r"

We serially collected 75 pairs of upper and lower respiratory tract cultures from 14 patients treated with mechanical ventilation for at least one week, examined patterns of airway colonization and routes of bacterial entry for Pseudomonas sp and other enteric Gram-negative bacteria (EGNB), and related these findings to host-associated factors, including nutritional status. Pseudomonas sp were the most common species isolates taken from the lower airway, found in nine of 14 patients and in 41.3 percent of all cultures. In contrast to other EGNB, Pseudomonas sp were found significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more often in the tracheobronchial tree (31 of 75 cultures) than in the oropharynx (18 of 75 cultures). Primary colonization of the lower airway by Pseudomonas sp was found in four patients, while other EGNB never followed this pattern when subjects were studied with cultures taken every third day. A host-related factor related to lower airway colonization by Pseudomonas species was poor nutritional status, assessed by a multifactorial index (p less than or equal to 0.01). We conclude that in mechanically ventilated patients, Pseudomonas sp colonize the lower airway in a different pattern and by a different route from those of other EGNB. The findings that Pseudomonas sp preferentially colonize the tracheobronchial tree may be important for the design of strategies to prevent airway colonization. The recognition that poor nutritional status, a potentially modifiable host-related factor, favors lower airway growth of Pseudomonas sp suggests one direction for future infection-control efforts.\r"

Prior investigations of this subject focus primarily on arterial hypoxemia. Our observations of ETS revealed significant falls in the mixed SvO2 and we postulated that alterations in VO2 or CO must be occurring. This study was then designed to determine the alterations in CO, VO2, SaO2 and the resulting effect on SvO2 during ETS. Ten critically ill intubated patients with pulmonary artery catheters in place, were studied during routine ETS by the nursing staff. We found that ETS produced a significant decrease in SvO2 which was predominantly due to an increased VO2 accompanied by an inadequate rise or even fall in CO. Alterations in SaO2 appeared to be modest and were insensitive indicators of alterations in SvO2.\r"

Relation was noted to extent of TPL performed, side of TPL, age at TPL, and degree of secondary scoliosis. Test results showed mixed restrictive and obstructive defects. Although extent of TPL did not correlate with current lung function values, the restrictive defect was probably caused by a mixture of (a) compression of lung by TPL and (b) fibrosis from old pulmonary tuberculosis. The obstructive defect might have been due to the TPL procedure itself or to chronic bronchitis related to (a) previous pulmonary TB or (b) cigarette smoking, since 14 subjects were former or current smokers. That Dsb was relatively preserved suggests that pulmonary hypertension as a late sequela of TPL may be reactive (secondary to hypoxemia and respiratory acidemia) rather than obliterative.\r"

Measurements were performed prior to thoracotomy and just after rib cage closure. Before surgery, patients with valvular disease had significantly higher respiratory system and lung elastances and resistances than those with ischemic heart disease. After surgery, patients with valvular disease showed a decrease in respiratory system and lung resistances. Surgery strikingly modified chest wall resistive properties in both groups. Postoperatively, the mechanical properties of the respiratory system were very similar in valvular and ischemic patients.\r"

The optimal stimulation site for electroventilation was first determined using hand-held, stimulating electrodes. Then electrodes, 4.1 cm in diameter, were sutured bilaterally to the optimal stimulation site. The relationship between inspired volume and stimulus intensity was determined using a 0.8-s burst of stimuli (60/s) with a pulse duration of 0.1 ms. Using the same electrodes, the threshold current for producing ectopic beats was determined for single pulses ranging from 0.1 to 10 ms duration. In all dogs, the current required to produce an ectopic beat increased greatly as the pulse duration decreased. At 0.1 ms, the safety factor for electroventilation was calculated to be 25.8.\r"

Four of the eight patients were atopic, and seven showed bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (BHR). Patch and intradermal skin tests with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) could not discriminate the patients from control subjects. All patients had positive reactions to CoCl2 in the provocation tests; two developed immediate asthmatic reaction (IAR), four late asthmatic reaction (LAR), and two dual asthmatic reaction (DAR), while the control subjects showed no reaction. Evidence of specific IgE antibodies to cobalt-conjugated human serum albumin (Co-HSA) was presented by four patients (RAST score greater than 2) based on comparison of serum samples from 60 asthmatic patients and 25 asymptomatic workers in the same plant. Positive serum samples selectively bound 57Co, and the test was blocked by nonlabled cobalt sulfate (CoSO4).

Univariate analysis of incremental risk factors for in-hospital mortality identified the following: age over 60 years (p = 0.015); and advanced preoperative NYHA class (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for in-hospital mortality identified the following: age (p = 0.038); NYHA class (p = 0.018); and year of operation (p = 0.049). Incremental risk factors for late mortality were identified as age (p = 0.003), year of operation (p = 0.003), concomitant procedure (p = 0.047), and valvular lesion (regurgitation) (p = 0.053). Actuarial survival of patients (+/- SE) was 87 +/- 2 percent, 75 +/- 3 percent, and 61 +/- 5 percent at 2, 5, and 8.7 years, respectively.

To assess further the potential effect of ISA on LVH, we retrospectively evaluated the effect of carteolol, a nonspecific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with strong ISA, upon ECG evidence of LVH. In 12 patients with LVH, carteolol treatment for one year reduced mean arterial blood pressures from 120 +/- 2 mm Hg to 100 +/- 2 mm Hg and mean hypertrophy scores from 5.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 0.8. Therefore, ISA does not preclude the regression of ECG evidence of LVH during the treatment of hypertension.\r"

Magnesium-containing cathartics are generally recommended in conjunction with OAC in the treatment of drug or toxin ingestions. We report two cases of hypermagnesemia complicating the treatment of theophylline toxicity with OAC and magnesium citrate. In both patients, the hypermagnesemia contributed significantly to morbidity or mortality. In light of these cases and after review of the literature, we suggest that sorbitol be considered the cathartic agent of choice in the treatment of theophylline toxicity with OAC.\r"

To evaluate the effects of variations in sleep quality on breathing, we studied 48 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age, 70 years). Electroencephalographically derived indices of sleep quality were correlated with spirometric performance, MIP, MEP, and waking SaO2. We found significant correlations between several indices of sleep quality and the spirometric measurements in the group as a whole, and striking correlations between sleep quality and PFTs in those with sleep efficiency less than or equal to 70 percent. We conclude that sleep disturbance may be related to poor performance on PFTs. These results suggest that spirometry should be performed on well-rested patients. The results also point to sleep quality as a potentially important variable in the management of patients with pulmonary disease.\r"

Prior to treatment, resembling the findings in bleomycin fibrosis, many CFA patients had decreased proportions of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (percent of total phospholipid; median 10.5, range 0 to 35.1 compared with 18.2, range 9.6 to 24.2 for the control group of similar age range and smoking habits; p less than 0.01). Following the initial lavage, the patients were treated with prednisolone. The initial percentage of PG levels did not predict response to prednisolone, but serial lavage studies conducted in 14 patients suggest that an early and sustained increase in percentage of PG following commencement of prednisolone is associated with clinical improvement. The reasons for the proportional reductions in phosphatidylglycerol, and whether they result in functional deficiency of surfactant in CFA, need to be explored.\r"

Ventilators were adjusted so as to reduce the peak phasic diaphragm electromyogram signal by at least 50 percent. All subjects demonstrated an increase in the total number of apneas + hypopneas per hour on NPV control nights. Although differences were not significant, there was a tendency to develop decreased sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation and altered sleep architecture with NPV. We conclude that nocturnal NPV can induce sleep apneas and impair sleep quality in normal subjects.\r"

  ".U": "89078230\r", 
  ".W": "In the rat, PRL secretion is under inhibitory control by tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons. The levels of dopamine (DA) in hypophysial portal blood decline during surges of PRL secretion (e.g. suckling and cervical stimulation). However, this decline alone is not sufficient to account for the amount of PRL released. In this study we investigated the possible existence of an endogenous stimulatory rhythm for PRL secretion that may be masked by the tonic inhibitory tone of DA and unmasked by the DA-lowering effects of cervical stimulation. The PRL secretory response to pharmacological depression of DA-ergic tone was studied in ovariectomized (OVX) female, adult castrated (AC) male, neonatally androgen-sterilized (TP) female, and neonatally castrated (NC) male rats. Since mated rats have serum PRL surges at 0300 and 1700 h, these groups were treated with 200 micrograms/kg domperidone (DOM), iv, at 0300 h, 1700 h, or the intersurge interval, 1200 h. Serial blood samples were collected immediately before and at frequent intervals after DOM injection. OVX female rats had significantly greater serum PRL responses to DOM at 0300 and 1700 h than at 1200 h. AC male rats secreted significantly less PRL in response to DOM compared to OVX rats, and their PRL responses to DOM were similar at all three times. TP female rats had PRL secretory responses similar to those of the OVX rats at 1200 h, and the responses at 0300 and 1700 h were similar. NC male rats had PRL secretory responses similar to those of AC male rats. There was no difference between the PRL secretory profiles at any time after DOM injection in NC rats. These data provide evidence for an endogenous stimulatory rhythm for PRL secretion that is specific to female rats. They further suggest that the neonatal steroid environment is critical for differentiation of some sexually specific characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the stimulation of arachidonic acid prostaglandins (PG) mediates the masculinizing effects of testosterone in the fetal mouse. We examined a number of situations in which masculine organization was either induced or inhibited by external agents and determined whether PG levels in the fetal genital tracts were altered in a manner coincident with those situations. We show here that both PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels in the male fetal genital tracts increased with the advancement of masculine differentiation. PG levels in males (1.2 +/- 0.3 pg PGE2 and 0.1 +/- 0.03 pg 6-keto-PGF1 alpha on day 14 of gestation) increased to 2.1 +/- 0.3 pg PGE2 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 PG 6-keto-PGF1 alpha on day 18 of gestation. The PG levels in the male genital tract were significantly higher than the PG levels in the female genital tract throughout the period of sexual differentiation. Before this period, however, such as on day 14 of gestation (when male and female fetuses have identical genital tracts) we found no difference in their PG levels. Moreover, administration of testosterone (40 mg/kg) during the critical period of masculine differentiation (days 13-17 of gestation) significantly increased PG levels (approximately 2-fold) of female fetuses. Furthermore, we found that cyproterone acetate (20 mg/kg), an inhibitor of masculine differentiation, on days 13-17 of gestation deceased PG levels in male fetuses. In addition, administration of PG synthesis inhibitors, namely indomethacin (1 mg/kg) and aspirin (100 mg/kg), inhibited both resting and androgen-inducible PG levels in male and female fetuses. Considering these results together, it may be concluded that PGs have a critical role in the masculinizing action of fetal testosterone.\r"

We posed the question of whether deglycosylated hCG (dg-hCG) and desialylated hCG (ds-hCG) would behave as agonists at the LH/CG receptor in the primate in vivo, as this would bear on their potential clinical utility as LH/CG agonists or antagonists. Thus, we administered large doses (approximately 3 nmol) of highly purified dg-hCG, ds-hCG, hCG, or normal saline as a rapid iv injection to adult male cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3/group). Mean areas under the curves of plasma T over the first 6 h achieved with dg-hCG and ds-hCG were about 5-fold, significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that in the saline controls and not significantly (P greater than 0.05) different from that in hCG-injected animals. Despite comparable plasma T responses in the first 6 h, mean plasma concentrations of ds-hCG, dg-hCG, and hCG differed dramatically among the groups. Plasma ds-hCG and dg-hCG levels were undetectable by 15 and 180 min, respectively, while the mean plasma hCG level was more than 2.10 nmol/L at 360 min. These data indicate that 1) dg-hCG is a full agonist at the LH/CG receptor in the primate in vivo, despite having minimal intrinsic activity in the rat Leydig cell adenyl cyclase assay and being able to near-completely antagonize hCG action therein; and 2) ds-hCG is a full agonist in the monkey in vivo, capable of stimulating a full testicular response over 6 h, despite being cleared from the circulation in 15 min. We conclude that the signal transduction system at the monkey LH/CG receptor is capable of achieving full steroidogenesis despite dramatically shortened exposure to stimulus or exposure to a stimulus with markedly reduced adenyl cyclase-stimulating activity in vitro.\r"

Quantitative RNA studies from our laboratory show an increase in the VIP messenger RNA (mRNA) content in the hypothalamus of lactating rats. The purpose of this investigation is to determine which hypothalamic neurons are increasing the expression of VIP. A sensitive in situ hybridization assay employing synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes corresponding to specific exons of the VIP gene was used to study VIP gene expression at the neuronal level. We were able to detect VIP-encoding transcripts in various brain regions including the ventrolateral thalamus, neocortex, pyriform cortex, and hypothalamus with a particularly high concentration in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. When lactating animals were compared to non-lactating animals, a 2-fold increase was observed in VIP transcripts in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Since the suprachiasmatic nucleus is not directly associated with the physiology of lactation, the response of the VIP gene to lactation may be, in part, indirect. Taken together, our results suggest that lactation and the expression of the VIP gene are interrelated.\r"

Such a surge was invariably accompanied by a decrease from early morning (1000 h) values in the number of NAL-binding sites detectable in the MBH, while the affinity of the binding site was not affected over the course of the day. Time-course studies indicated that P injection at 1000 h on day 2 was followed by a transient midday elevation in the amount of NAL bound to slices of MBH; the binding decreased significantly before the onset of and during the LH surge. A similar diurnal change was not observed in MBH slices of either oil-treated OVX rats (controls) or EB-treated OVX rats, which displayed only a 2-fold increase in LH release in the afternoon. Further studies indicated a similar change in NAL binding to slices of the POA of EBP-treated rats. Since hypothalamic opioid systems inhibit LH release, the decrease in opioid binding to MBH as well as POA slices suggests that P may curtail the existing opioid inhibitory influence in these areas before and during the course of the afternoon LH surge.\r"

One way in which the ovarian steroid 17 beta-estradiol (E2) has been shown to modulate OT transmission is by increasing OT receptor binding in certain brain areas involved in the regulation of female sexual behavior such as the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). This study was undertaken to describe the distribution of OT receptors within the VMN that are regulated by physiological levels of E2. With quantitative autoradiographic methods, we measured [3H]OT binding in ovariectomized female rats implanted with Silastic capsules containing cholesterol, 5% E2, or 100% E2. In addition, plasma E2 levels, pituitary progestin receptor binding, and uterine weights were measured in animals from each treatment group. Results of this study showed that physiological levels of E2 increased [3H]OT binding in caudal regions of the ventrolateral VMN and stimulated maximal uterine growth and pituitary progestin receptor binding. However, in more rostral VMN sections, E2 induced a dose-dependent increase in [3H]OT binding. These data suggest that ovarian steroids sensitize the brain to OT by increasing OT receptor binding in certain brain areas involved in the regulation of sexual receptivity.\r"

A nucleotide present in nanomoles per g quantity correlated with the induction of this mRNA by sucrose. Four hours after sucrose feeding the content of this compound was 7 times greater than that in fasted rats. Furthermore, the response was rapid, attaining maximal levels 30 min after feeding, and remaining elevated for at least 4 h. The content of this nucleotide also correlated with the content of mRNA-S14 in the steady state, with the lowest levels of both mRNA-S14 and this nucleotide in fasted rats, intermediate levels in rats maintained on a regular chow diet, and the highest levels in rats fed a 60% sucrose diet for 4 days. Lastly, while the response of mRNA-S14 to thyroid hormone and sucrose is synergistic, the thyroidal state does not influence the response of this compound to sucrose. Thus, the interaction of thyroid hormone and sucrose on mRNA-S14 is distal to the generation of this compound. Based on the UV spectrum, HPLC retention, and [3H]adenosine labeling, this compound contains adenine. However, it is not any of the common adenine-containing mono- or oligonucleotides. These data indicate that a novel hepatic nucleotide is induced by sucrose and raise the possibility that this nucleotide is responsible for the induction of carbohydrate-responsive mRNAs.\r"

We sought to identify the cellular localization of angiotensinogen mRNA in these two tissues using hybridization in situ of tissues obtained from both control rats and rats administered a combination of dexamethasone, ethynylestradiol, and T3. For the adrenal of hormone-treated rats, angiotensinogen mRNA was identified in periadrenal fibroblast-like cells and brown adipose tissue. For control rats, positive hybridization was obtained for fibroblast-like cells immediately adjacent to the adrenal capsule, but not for periadrenal brown adipose tissue. No hybridization was obtained for cells of the adrenal cortex, medulla, capsule or vessels. For the lung of hormone treated, but not control rats, angiotensinogen mRNA was identified in perivascular and peribronchial fibroblast-like cells and brown adipose tissue in the lung hilum. No hybridization was obtained for pulmonary parenchyma, bronchi, or vessels. These results confirm the widespread tissue distribution of angiotensinogen mRNA, and provide further evidence for the formation of angiotensin within tissues by mechanisms independent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system.\r"

In the present studies, we have sought to obtain one or more compounds derived from hCG that are able to inhibit binding to TSH to the high affinity receptor in human thyroid membranes, and, consequently, could inhibit the stimulatory effect of TSH and Graves' immunoglobulin G and which also display a relatively low affinity for the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor and, as a consequence, have a reasonable survival in the circulation. Two hCG forms isolated by sequential chromatography of crude hCG on DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-100 were of interest, since they displayed some degree of selectivity in binding to thyroid and liver receptors. The first form (hCGv), whose isolation we described previously, was comprised of partially desialylated variant forms of intact hCG. The second material, as judged from its immunoreactivity, elution behavior on Bio-Gel P-100, and migration during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, contained a fragment of the beta-subunit (BF), similar to the beta-core fragment described by others. However, BF differed from the beta-core fragment in having a higher sialic acid content. Interestingly, we found that BF as well as the enzymatically desialylated form of BF displayed a much lower affinity for mouse liver receptors than did asialo-hCGp or the free asialo-beta- and asialo-alpha-subunits. Further, the activity of BF to inhibit the binding of [125I]bTSH to human thyroid membranes exceeded that of the desialylated subunits of hCGp as well as that of intact hCGp, but was only exerted at the low affinity binding site and was not accompanied by inhibition of TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase. In an attempt to shift the locus of BF action from the low to the high affinity TSH receptor, we recombined BF with either an intact alpha-subunit of hCG or an asialo-alpha-subunit. This led to the creation of two novel forms of hCG with properties of the type that we were seeking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of extracellular calcium (Ca2+) on the cellular action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined using depolarizing agents in rat renal papillary collecting tubule cells in culture. One-hour exposure of cells to veratridine enhanced AVP-induced cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. This enhancement by veratridine of cellular cAMP production in response to AVP was totally blunted by cotreatment with 5 X 10(-4) M verapamil, 3 X 10(-3) M cobalt, or Ca2+-free medium containing 1 X 10(-3) M EGTA. These agents block cellular Ca2+ uptake by different mechanisms. Similarly, 60 mM KCl enhanced AVP-induced cAMP production, and this effect was blocked by pretreatment with verapamil, cobalt or Ca2+-free medium containing 1 X 10(-3) M EGTA. When cellular free Ca2+ concentrations [Ca2+]i were measured by the fluorescence dye fura-2, both 1 X 10(-4) M veratridine and 60 mM KCl significantly increased [Ca2+]i from 67.6 to 141.8 nM and from 74.6 to 166.2 nM, respectively. Such rises in [Ca2+]i depended on extracellular Ca2+ since the increase in [Ca2+]i was completely blocked in Ca2+-free medium or in the presence of 3 X 10(-3) M cobalt. In addition, veratridine and 60 mM KCl significantly augmented the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. The possible mechanisms by which depolarizing agents induce cellular Ca2+ mobilization include the opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. The present results indicate that veratridine and 60 mM KCl enhance AVP-induced cAMP production and cellular free Ca2+ concentration through cellular Ca2+ uptake in renal papillary collecting tubule.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated in male rats the effects of a range of doses of 17 beta-estradiol on PRL gene transcription, the level of circulating estradiol, and the levels of nuclear and cytosolic forms of the anterior pituitary estrogen receptor. One hour after 17 beta-estradiol injection, transcription of the PRL gene was significantly stimulated by 0.1 micrograms and maximally stimulated by 1.0 microgram/animal. Lesser stimulatory effects were observed 1 h after injection of 10 or 100 micrograms. At this 1 h point, the level of circulating estradiol was linearly increased relative to the 17 beta-estradiol dose. The level of nuclear form estrogen receptor was increased from 8% of the total receptor content in control rats to 12%, 28%, 50%, and 64% of the total receptor content in rats that received 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100 micrograms, respectively. The anterior pituitaries of rats injected with 100 micrograms 17 beta-estradiol contained 30% fewer measurable estrogen receptors than control rats. Thus, dose-dependent losses of transcriptional responsiveness and measurable estrogen receptor were observed 1 h after injection of the larger doses of 17 beta-estradiol. Twenty-four hours after injection of the various doses of 17 beta-estradiol, PRL gene transcription was stimulated 1.3-fold in response to 0.1 microgram and approximately 2-fold in response to 1.0, 10, and 100 micrograms. At the 24 h point the circulating level of this hormone and the levels of nuclear and cytosolic forms of the estrogen receptor had returned to near their control values. This differing dose responsiveness at 1 and 24 h supports our previously reported observation that estrogen regulates PRL gene transcription in vivo through at least two independent mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of T3 entry into cells was studied in undifferentiated NB41A3 neuroblasts and after differentiation with 0.5 mM sodium butyrate. In undifferentiated neuroblasts, cell uptake of labeled L-T3 at 2 h was reduced to 43% of the control value by excess L-T3, whereas only 5.9% of D-T3 uptake was saturable. After incubation of intact cells with labeled hormone, the nuclei contained 3.8% of the total cellular L-T3 and 4.3% of D-T3. Thus, L-T3 nuclear uptake was 3 times higher than D-T3. Kinetic analysis of the initial rate of uptake of L-T3 by the cells gave a Km of 1.25 nM and a maximum velocity of 2.38 fmol/min.10(6) cells. The initial rate of D-T3 uptake was not saturable. Inhibitors of ATP production (antimycin and oligomycin) as well as monodansylcadaverine virtually abolished saturable cell uptake and decreased nuclear uptake more than total cell uptake, suggesting that the saturable component of uptake into the cells is the major source of nuclear L-T3. After differentiation by butyrate, both cell uptake and nuclear uptake of L-T3 increased. The apparent affinity (Ka) of the nuclear T3 receptors was determined in intact cells and compared with the Ka measured with isolated nuclei. In undifferentiated cells, the apparent Ka was 3-fold higher than the true Ka, presumably due to a step-up in the free T3 concentration in the cytosol compared to that in the incubation medium. After butyrate exposure, the apparent nuclear Ka was decreased to less than 1.5 times the control value, but Ka in isolated nuclei was unchanged. The number of nuclear receptors, however, was increased by butyrate in both intact cell and isolated nuclei experiments. These results indicate that butyrate exerts separate effects on the number of nuclear receptors and saturable T3 transport in mouse neuroblasts.\r"

In the present study, we attempted to ascertain whether the ontogenic appearance of PRL mRNA and hormone release were temporally coordinated or discordant. Our results show that the PRL gene is expressed at least 3 days before the onset of secretion in newborn rats. Moreover, steady state levels of PRL mRNA in neonates are at least as high as those found in 10-day-old rats, in which 15-17% of all pituitary cells secret the hormone. This apparent blockage of translation is attributable to a lack of association of PRL message with ribosomes in the neonate. Taken together, these data indicate that the ontogeny of PRL secretion in rats is regulated translationally as well as transcriptionally.\r"

  ".U": "89078259\r", 
  ".W": "We previously described an in vitro incubation system for studying the mechanism of inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalyzed iodination by the antithyroid drug 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole (MMI). Inhibition of iodination in this system may be reversible or irreversible, depending on the relative concentrations of iodide and MMI and on the TPO concentration. Metabolism of the drug occurs under both conditions, and in the present investigation we used 35S- and 14C-labeled MMI together with reverse phase HPLC to examine the metabolic products associated with reversible and irreversible inhibition of iodination by MMI. Under conditions of reversible inhibition, MMI was rapidly metabolized and disappeared completely from the incubation mixture. With [35S]MMI, the earliest detectable 35S-labeled product was MMI disulfide, which reached a peak after a few minutes and then declined to undetectable levels. Coincident with the decrease in disulfide was the appearance of two 35S peaks, the major one corresponding to sulfate/sulfite, and the other to a component eluting at 7.5 min. Similar results were obtained for the disulfide and for the 7.5 min metabolite with [14C]MMI. The major 14C-labeled metabolite containing no S appeared to be 1-methylimidazole. Under conditions of irreversible inhibition, MMI disulfide was also the earliest detectable 35S-labeled metabolite. However, MMI decreased more slowly, and after reaching a nadir at about 6 min returned gradually to a level about halfway between the initial and the minimum value. The reformation of MMI appeared to involve the nonenzymatic disproportionation of MMI disulfide. Formation of the 7.5 min peak was also observed, but there was no formation of sulfate/sulfite. The difference in metabolic pattern between the reversible and irreversible conditions is primarily related to the rapid inactivation of TPO that occurs under irreversible conditions. The metabolism of [35S]MMI in thyroids of rats injected with the labeled drug resembles more closely conditions of reversible inhibition, since sulfate/sulfite is the only 35S-labeled metabolite. Neither [35S]MMI disulfide nor the 7.5 min component was detected in rat thyroids in vivo. However, it was demonstrated that these components do not survive homogenization with thyroid tissue, and failure to detect them in vivo does not exclude them as likely intermediates in intrathyroidal MMI metabolism. Based on the observations reported in this study, we present a revised scheme for the mechanism of inhibition of TPO-catalyzed iodination by MMI.\r"

IGF-I and -II were studied for their effects on collagen synthesis and degradation in cultures of intact fetal rat calvariae and on type I collagen transcript levels in osteoblast-enriched (Ob) cells from fetal rat parietal bone. IGF-I and -II increased [3H]proline incorporation into type I collagen independently of their effect on cell replication. IGF-I and -II also decreased collagen degradation in calvarial cultures. Both factors had similar actions, although IGF-I stimulated collagen synthesis at 10 nM, and IGF-II at 30 nM. In Ob cells, IGF-I and -II also increased [3H]proline incorporation into type I collagen, but the effect was seen at 100 nM, and neither factor decreased collagen degradation. Slot blot analysis of IGF-I- and IGF-II-treated cells, using a rat type I collagen cDNA probe, revealed an increase in type I collagen transcripts. In conclusion, IGF-I and -II increase bone collagen synthesis and decrease collagen degradation in cultures of intact calvariae; the effect on collagen synthesis correlates with an increase in transcript levels in Ob cells.\r"

  ".U": "89078262\r", 
  ".W": "The C-17 fatty acid esters of estradiol (E2) are a unique family of nonpolar estradiol metabolites. They are potent long-acting estrogens that represent the natural analog of the synthetic esters used for estrogen therapy. We measured the uterotropic response and the formation of uterine nuclear estrogen receptors (ERn) produced by iv administration of a representative ester, E2-17-stearate, in comparison to E2, other natural C-17 conjugates of E2, E2-17-glucuronide, and E2-17-sulfate, and the pharmacological ester E2-17-cyclopentylpropionate. While E2-17-stearate produced a sustained and greater uterotropic response compared to E2, the maximal induction of ERn by the ester was only about one third of that induced by a similar dose of E2. However, the induction of ERn by E2-17-stearate was markedly sustained compared to that by E2. Furthermore, the initiation of the ERn response to E2-17-stearate was delayed. Since E2-17-esters do not bind to the ER, this delay is consistent with the requirement for hydrolysis of the esters before interaction with the ER. Neither of the ionic conjugates of E2 (sulfate and glucuronide) produced an increase in ERn concentrations or a uterotropic response. The synthetic ester cyclopentylpropionate, like E2, produced a rapid ERn response and a significantly shorter uterotropic response than the stearate ester. When the induction of ERn by E2-17-stearate was investigated in other target tissues there were no marked differences in the brain, pituitary, and liver. No blood-brain barrier was apparent for the formation of ERn, despite the fact that this steroidal ester circulates in the blood bound to lipoproteins. These findings suggest that this unusual family of steroidal esters has biological properties that differentiate them from other known estrogens, natural and synthetic, in terms of their ability to produce a slow-onset sustained estrogenic stimulus in a variety of different estrogen target tissues.\r"

Twenty-four hours after ovariectomy 10 fetuses (5 males and 5 females) were collected and each injected sc with 0.33 microgram/100 g BW [125I]progestin (SA, 2200 Ci/mM). For competition, two additional fetuses were injected with 20 micrograms R5020 1 h before (Z)-17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-(2[125I]iodovinyl)4-estren-3-one [( 125I]Progestin) to demonstrate that nuclear uptake and retention of radioactivity were specific for progestin. Two hours after injection of [125I]Progestin all fetuses were mounted, frozen, and sectioned in a cryostat. After 1-37 days of exposure, sections were developed and scanned for labeled cells. Cells with nuclear concentration were found in the male and female preoptic area, within certain nuclear groups in the basal hypothalamus, in the central gray of the midbrain, and in the pituitary. No labeling was detected in the cortex or amygdala. The results indicate that cells in certain regions of the brain and pituitary express progestin receptors at the end of gestation and suggest that progesterone is important for the normal development of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Residues 121-149 of equine LH beta (eLH beta) were removed by a simple mild acid treatment procedure. The modified eLH beta, des(121-149)eLH beta, was isolated by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. Recombination of des(121-149)eLH beta with eLH alpha and ovine LH alpha (oLH alpha) produced LH derivatives as efficiently as recombination with native eLH beta. In rat testicular LH radioligand assay systems employed in this study the potencies of the resulting LH preparations were, in order of decreasing potency: des(121-149)eLH beta:eLH alpha hybrid greater than eLH greater than eLH alpha + beta greater than oLH greater than des(121-149)eLH beta:oLH alpha greater than oLH alpha + eLH beta (1:0.82:0.67:0.15:0.02:0.006, eLH tracer; 1:0.88:0.67:0.21:0.02:0.006, hCG tracer). In a horse testicular LH radioligand assay with eLH tracer, only the equine LH derivatives were active, and the order of potencies was the same: des(121-149)eLH beta:eLH alpha hybrid greater than eLH greater than eLH alpha + beta (1:0.58:0.46). In a rat testicular Leydig cell steroidogenesis assay, eLH was the most active preparation, but the relative potencies of the other preparations remained unchanged: eLH greater than des(121-149)eLH beta:eLH alpha greater than eLH alpha + beta greater than oLH greater than des(121-149)eLH beta:oLH alpha greater than oLH alpha + eLH beta (1:0.61:0.55:0.27:0.004:0.003). We have previously reported that the hybrid consisting of native eLH beta and oLH alpha was inactive (less than 1%) in LH receptor and steroidogenesis assays. The data reported herein confirm this observation and demonstrate that the absence of LH activity in eLH beta:oLH alpha cannot be attributed to the C-terminal extension on eLH beta, since the des(121-149)eLH beta:oLH alpha hybrid LH is also inactive. Examination of the intrinsic FSH activity of eLH in both rat and chicken testicular FSH radioligand assays produced the following results; eLH, recombined eLH subunits, and des(121-149)eLH beta:eLH alpha were all of the same potency (13% and 0.9% as active as eFSH in rats and chickens, respectively). We conclude that the C-terminal extension on eLH and eCG beta-subunits is not involved in subunit association, LH receptor binding, or FSH receptor binding. The derivative des(121-149)eLH beta:eLH alpha provides a model compound that may be useful in determining the role, if any, of the glycoprotein hormone C-terminal extension that appears to have arisen independently at least twice in mammalian evolution.\r"

In SaOS-2 cells, hPTH-(1-34) (2.5 nM), hPTHrP-(1-34) (2.5 nM), and VIP (10-100 nM) stimulated the accumulation of cAMP markedly (greater than 20- to 30-fold in 1 h). Cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 4-24 h, then in the absence or presence of E2 for 4 h before a 1-h stimulation with peptide hormone in the absence of E2. In SaOS-2 cells, pretreatment with E2 (10(-12)-10(-8) M) for 4 h inhibited by up to 50% the accumulation of cAMP stimulated by hPTH-(1-34) or hPTHrP-(1-34), but E2 had no inhibitory effect on VIP action. 17 alpha-Estradiol had no inhibitory action on hPTH- or hPTHrP-stimulated accumulation of cAMP at concentrations as high as 10(-8) M. Additional evidence against a nonspecific effect of E2 was the total lack of inhibition of cAMP accumulation stimulated by hPTH-(1-34) or hPTHrP-(1-34) in ROS 17/2.8 cells at concentrations of E2 up to 10(-6) M. We conclude that E2 can act directly and rapidly in human osteoblast-like cells to modulate selectively the ability of hPTH and hPTHrP to enhance the production of cAMP.\r"

T implants raised serum T levels to the range found in gonad-intact rats and decreased serum LH levels to the basal range. Further, of the six brain sites examined, significant increases in NPY concentrations occurred selectively in the ME, ARC, and VMN of T-implanted rats. In the second experiment, the ability of T to reverse the effect of castration on NPY levels compared to those in intact (sham) rats was assessed. Again, castration decreased NPY levels in the ME, ARC, and VMN only, and replacement of physiological levels of T restored NPY levels approximately 100%, 127%, and 74% in the ARC, VMN, and ME, respectively. In the third experiment, the effect of castration and T implants (30-mm T capsules for 10 days) to 2-week castrated rats on the in vitro release of NPY from medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) was assessed. Basal NPY release was not significantly changed after castration and T replacement. However, in response to a 30-min pulse of KCl (45 mM) NPY release from the MBH of castrated rats was significantly reduced compared to that in intact and T-replaced castrated rats. These studies show that castration decreases and T replacement restores NPY levels selectively in three hypothalamic sites, viz. ME, ARC, and VMN, and KCl-induced NPY release from the MBH in vitro is decreased after castration and restored by T replacement, thereby suggesting that a local subset of androgen-concentrating neurons may regulate NPY levels and release in a site-specific manner. Further, these results are in line with our emerging view that gonadal steroids modulate neurosecretion not only of LHRH, but also of other functionally linked regulatory peptides.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we demonstrate glucocorticoid receptors in seminiferous tubules of the rat testis, and that these receptors are localized in Sertoli cells and peritubular cells. The receptors had high affinity for [3H]dexamethasone (Kd = 0.5 - 1 x 10(-9) M), and similar Kd values were calculated from equilibrium analysis and from rate studies (k1 = 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 min-1 and k-1 = 1.4 x 10(-3) min-1, O C). Binding specificity was typical for glucocorticoid receptors (affinity: dexamethasone greater than corticosterone greater than cortisol approximately R5020 approximately progesterone greater than aldosterone = R1881 greater than 17 beta-estradiol approximately cortisone approximately testosterone greater than 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone). The concentration of glucocorticoid receptors in rat seminiferous tubules revealed an age-dependent decrease, coinciding with the increase in the number of germ cells. Glucocorticoid receptor levels were higher in Sertoli cells from immature rats than in cells from adult rats. Cultured peritubular cells from immature rats contained levels of glucocorticoid receptors similar to cultured Sertoli cells from rats of the same age. With a nick-translated human glucocorticoid receptor complementary DNA probe, a messenger RNA (mRNA) species of approximately 7 kilobase was clearly detected in both Sertoli cells and peritubular cells. In peritubular cells, a smaller mRNA species (5 kilobase) was also clearly detectable. In mRNA from whole testis tissue, a similar developmental pattern as for dexamethasone binding was found. Dexamethasone caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of mRNA levels for androgen binding protein and for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit type II beta in cultured immature rat Sertoli cells. On the other hand, mRNA levels for glucocorticoid receptor decreased, whereas mRNA levels for beta-actin remained constant. This report documents for the first time the presence of glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid effects in rat Sertoli cells, and is also the first demonstration of glucocorticoid receptors in peritubular cells of the rat testis.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone (T) triggers aggressive behavior in males of many vertebrate species; however, the neural and hormonal basis of individual differences in the frequency or intensity of aggressive behavior is still debated. Using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), a species in which individuals exhibit a wide range of aggressiveness in nature and the laboratory, together with a newly devised test procedure for quantifying aggressiveness, we recently demonstrated that aggression is estrogen dependent. Here we extend these studies by testing the hypothesis that aromatization in brain is a rate-limiting step in the expression of individual differences in aggressiveness. Using procedures previously validated for this species, aromatase and 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reductase activities were estimated in selected brain regions of reproductively active male quail by measuring conversion of [3H]androstenedione to [3H]estrone, [3H]5 alpha-androstanedione, and [3H]5 beta-androstanedione, respectively. In Exp 1, behaviorally inexperienced test birds were killed 90 sec after a single behavioral test. Aggressiveness of individuals in this group, as determined by pecking and locomotor activity in response to visualization of a conspecific, ranged 3- to 4-fold from high to low. Aromatase activity in the posterior hypothalamus (PHYP) was significantly higher in males rated high for aggressiveness than in animals rated low (1.04 vs. 0.59 pmol/h.mg protein; P less than 0.02). Similar differences were observed in the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area (AHPOA) but were not significant. In Exp 2, sexually mature males were behaviorally tested eight times over 22 days and killed 24 h after the final test. Aggressiveness varied 5-fold from high to low, although the rating in a given bird remained constant with time and repeat testing. Aromatase activity in the AHPOA was significantly greater in birds rated high for aggressiveness than in low aggressiveness birds (3.77 vs. 2.80 pmol/h.mg protein; P less than 0.02). In addition, when AHPOA aromatase in all birds was plotted against behavioral intensity, there was a 2-fold variation and a significant positive correlation (r = 0.556; P less than 0.02). Similar differences were observed in PHYP, but these were of borderline significance. By contrast, aromatase levels outside the AHPOA and PHYP were unrelated to behavior. Moreover, in both Exp 1 and 2, 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reductase activities in AHPOA, PHYP, and other brain regions; plasma T, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and total estrogens; and relative testicular weights were not consistently related to aggression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which cortisol in plasma enters hepatic cells was investigated using the isolated perfused rat liver. To determine whether hepatic uptake of cortisol from serum can be accounted for entirely by the pool of unbound (free) cortisol, we compared observed uptake rates with the equilibrium-free fraction of cortisol in serum and the rates of dissociation of cortisol from its serum binding proteins (determined using a rapid filtration assay based on transfer of [3H] cortisol to dextran-coated charcoal). More than 95% of the cortisol in both human and rat serum dissociated spontaneously from its binding proteins within 5 sec at 37 C. The fractional unidirectional hepatic uptakes of cortisol from pooled human serum and pooled rat serum were 59.4 +/- 5.4% and 59.5 +/- 1.0% (mean +/- SE), respectively, at the physiological flow rate of 1 ml/min.g liver. The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these sera were 4.53 +/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively. The fractional unidirectional hepatic uptake of cortisol from protein-free buffer averaged 99.9% (n = 5) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.g liver. By calculating the appropriate rate constants and applying the Kety-Renkin-Crone equation to the above data, it can be shown that all of the cortisol taken up from serum by the perfused rat liver can be accounted for by the pool of free cortisol, which turns over very rapidly. The physiological significance of this finding is discussed in terms of a general mathematical model of hormone transport that delineates the conditions under which the free hormone hypothesis is and is not valid.\r"

The size of the prodynorphin transcript found in these cells (approximately 2200 nucleotides) is identical to that found in the intact testis. R2C cells also contain proteolytically processed prodynorphin-derived peptides. In R2C cells, the endogenous prodynorphin gene and cellular levels of prodynophin-derived peptides are positively regulated by cAMP analogs, while phorbol esters exert a slight negative regulation of the prodynorphin mRNA. Using gene transfer techniques, we have identified a 210-basepair fragment of the rat prodynorphin gene which initiates the transcription of the bacterial reporter molecule, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase. The chimeric fusion gene, when transfected into R2C cells, exhibited the same positive response to cAMP analogs as the endogenous gene. The results suggest that a cAMP regulatory element resides within the cloned rat prodynorphin fragment, and that the element is functionally active in R2C cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperplasia of the thyroid gland induced by propylthiouracil (PTU) is a well established model of rapid cell proliferation in vivo. Recent evidence indicates that tyrosine kinase activity is associated with growth factor receptors and oncogene protein products and may have an important regulatory action in the control of cell growth. Thus, we examined tyrosine kinase activity in rat thyroid membrane and cytosol preparations at rest and during PTU-induced hyperplasia. Although kinase activity was present in a crude microsomal membrane preparation, no change was observed during thyroid growth. In contrast, tyrosine kinase activity assayed with the artificial substrate poly(Glu,Na:Tyr) 4:1 was present in normal rat thyroid cytosol and increased 2- to 6-fold during the rapid phase of hyperplasia in the first 5-10 days of PTU treatment. It declined to control values by day 15, when the size and DNA content of the thyroid reached a plateau. Preincubation of the cytosolic preparations with several peptides known to bind to and activate growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases failed to enhance the activity, suggesting, along with the cytosolic localization, that the activity was distinct from these receptors. By gel filtration chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, tyrosine kinase activity was associated with a 55 kDa protein. Partial purification over a poly(Glu,Na:Tyr)4:1-Sepharose column, yielded a protein that appeared capable of autophosphorylation. It is suggested that this tyrosine kinase plays a role in mediating the growth-promoting effects of this model of thyroid cell hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to obtain a detailed characterization of pulsatile PRL secretory patterns under basal conditions and to explore the role of dopamine (DA) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the genesis of PRL pulses. Adult intact male rats received chronic indwelling jugular canula and were bled at 3-min intervals for periods ranging from 90-150 min. Pulse analysis was performed using the algorithm Detect. Blockade of DA receptors with domperidone, pimozide, or haloperidol resulted in a 2-fold increase in PRL pulse frequency, with no change in pulse duration. All quantitative parameters, i.e. peak and trough values, pulse amplitude, and area under the pulse, were significantly increased after dopaminergic blockade. Blockade of endogenous VIP activity was achieved by passive immunization with a potent VIP antiserum. This treatment, by itself, did not modify basal PRL levels or PRL pulsatility parameters. However, when VIP antiserum was administered in combination with domperidone, a reduction in all quantitative pulse parameters was observed. Heterogeneity of PRL pulses was evaluated by frequency distribution analysis, using the area under the pulse divided by basal secretion, to evaluate the mass of hormone secreted per pulse normalized to the basal rate of secretion. Untreated animals presented pulses within a range of different masses. Dopaminergic blockade resulted in a great reduction in big mass pulses, and the distribution of pulses was restricted primarily to small mass pulses. The increased pulse frequency after dopaminergic blockade, therefore, results mainly from an increase in the appearance of small mass pulses. These results indicate that DA exerts a tonic inhibitory action on the frequency as well as the qualitative parameters of PRL pulses. They also suggest that big mass PRL pulses are dopaminergic in origin, i.e. they may result from temporary interruptions in DA activity. Small mass PRL pulses appear to result from other neural stimulatory inputs. Endogenous VIP enhances quantitative PRL pulse parameters, but this activity is only apparent after removal of DA inhibition.\r"

  ".U": "89078293\r", 
  ".W": "PRL levels during the estrous cycle have been reported to be low, with the notable exception of the afternoon proestrous surge. The present study was designed to evaluate the pulsatile pattern of PRL secretion during the low secretory phases of the cycle. Animals were bled at 3-min intervals for 150 min during proestrus morning (AM), estrus AM and evening (PM), metestrus AM, and diestrus AM and PM. Using the algorithm Detect, pulse frequency, duration, interval, peak and trough values, area under the pulses, and mean PRL levels were calculated. PRL secretion was pulsatile during all stages of the estrous cycle, although the pattern varied considerably among the different cycle stages. Pulse frequency was highest during estrus and lowest during diestrus. All quantitative pulse parameters (peak, trough, amplitude, and area under pulse) were also higher during estrus and lowest in diestrus. Analysis of area under the pulse using frequency distribution indicated that at least two subpopulations of pulses, i.e. small mass and large mass pulses, were observed in certain stages of the cycle. Small mass pulses were present at all stages of the cycle; while their frequency remained unchanged, changes in other parameters were observed at different stages which did not always correlate with changes in mean PRL levels. Big mass pulses, on the other hand, presented a clear change in pulse frequency with values rising progressively from diestrus PM through proestrus to peak at estrus. Between estrus PM and metestrus AM these big mass PRL pulses essentially disappeared. In contrast to the marked changes in frequency, big mass PRL pulses were remarkably homogeneous in other quantitative characteristics. The results indicate that distinct changes in PRL pulsatility patterns occur during the estrous cycle; these changes are related to both the pattern and the quality of PRL pulses. Based on the observations of a companion study (28) and other data, we suggest that the genesis of the big mass and small mass PRL pulses involves dopaminergic and nondopaminergic mechanisms, respectively. The timing and selectivity of the changes in PRL pulsatile patterns suggest that those patterns may encode different signals for expression of the diverse actions of PRL on reproductive tissues.\r"

Seven days after priming with superovulatory doses of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin to induce luteal tissue formation, the rats were injected with a luteolytic dose of the prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue cloprostenol. The ovaries were then homogenized, a 30,000 x g supernatant and pellet were prepared, whereafter aliquots of the preparations were incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP with or without Ca2+. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and localized by autoradiography. The presence of Ca2+ caused an increased phosphorylation of a 45 kDa protein band in the particulate, but not in the cytosol, fraction. Furthermore, PGF2 alpha rapidly increased the 32P incorporation into the same protein band of 45 kDa. Thus, the PGF2 alpha-stimulated 32P incorporation was Ca2+-dependent and seen only in the particulate fraction. These results suggest that PGF2 alpha in its role as a luteolytic agent stimulates a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of a specific protein in luteal membranes of the rat ovary.\r"

Second, the hypothesis that has linked ovarian hormone deficiency bone loss to hypercalcemic suppression of the parathyroids leading to a decrease in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis and gut absorption of calcium was examined. Third, the effects of ovariectomy and a combination of ovarian hormone deficiency and low dietary calcium on bone and the calcium-regulating hormones were evaluated. After 6 months, ovariectomy and a low calcium diet independently decreased the density of the ilium, the femur, and the fourth lumbar vertebra as well as the calcium content of the latter two. The effects of the two treatment regimens were additive and more marked in the vertebral bone. Ovariectomy lowered serum calcitonin only in animals fed a normal diet and had no effect on serum PTH and vitamin D metabolites, while a low calcium diet caused a significant increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In both dietary regimens ovariectomy resulted in about a 30% decrease in intestinal calcium absorption. A low calcium diet increased morphometric indices of bone formation and bone resorption as did ovariectomy, with resorption exceeding formation. The discussion of our findings led to the conclusion that the aged rat model of ovarian hormone deficiency bone loss qualifies for serious consideration as a practical convenient cost-effective animal model for exploring aspects of the pathogenesis and treatment of postmenopausal bone loss.\r"

The disease-association data suggest that genetic variation at the INSR, APOB, and APOA1/C3/A4 loci contributes to the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The analysis of the INSR locus revealed \"protective\" haplotypes, and it may be possible to use two of the INSR haplotypes as genetic markers to identify individuals having a very low probability of developing NIDDM regardless of the presence of other genes conferring susceptibility to this disorder. The APOB and APOA1/C3/A4 loci appear to contribute to the development of NIDDM in individuals who are of lean/normal weight and overweight, respectively.

Genomic cloning and Southern blot analysis indicate that the normal human insulin-receptor gene is greater than or equal to 150 kilobases long and consists of a minimum of 17 exons, 6 in the genomic region of the alpha-subunit and 11 in the region of the beta-subunit. Three of the patients, one with leprechaunism and two with type A syndrome, have decreases in insulin-receptor mRNA but on genomic blot analysis have no obvious abnormalities in the insulin-receptor gene. No distinctive pattern of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms or evidence for major insertion or deletion mutations of the insulin-receptor gene was found in any of the patients. These data indicate that the insulin-receptor gene is greater than 35 times larger than coding regions and has a complex structure. Although leprechaunism and type A syndrome are most likely due to defects in the structure and expression of the insulin-receptor gene, they are likely to be associated with specific point mutations rather than major changes in gene structure.\r"

Approximately 2 wk later, venous and arterial catheters was implanted for subsequent (24 h later) vasopressin, electrolyte, and hemodynamic measurements. STZ-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the plasma glucose concentration, plasma osmolality, and plasma vasopressin concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was unchanged, but heart rate was reduced. Diabetes-prone BB rats, maintained on or withdrawn from insulin treatment for 24-48 h, and diabetes-resistant rats were instrumented and studied as above. Spontaneous-diabetes-prone rats demonstrated increase in plasma glucose concentration and plasma osmolality similar to STZ-D rats but had significantly greater plasma vasopressin concentrations. The significant decrease in MABP observed in these animals probably contributed to the enhanced vasopressin response. We conclude that both osmotic and cardiovascular parameters play important roles in vasopressin secretion in diabetic rats.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term regulation of hepatic mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) was studied in control, insulin-treated, and untreated spontaneously diabetic BB Wistar rats. The activity of CPT was elevated approximately twofold in the untreated diabetic rats. This corresponded to an approximately equivalent elevation in the immunoreactive CPT activity. mRNACPT was assayed by reticulocyte lysate translation and by dot blot to a CPT oligonucleotide probe. The level of mRNACPT was approximately proportional to the observed CPT activity. A cDNA probe to CPT was developed, and transcriptional activity for CPT was assessed in isolated hepatic nuclei. Again, transcription of CPT mRNA was approximately proportional to the observed activity. We therefore conclude that at least part of the long-term regulation of hepatic CPT in spontaneously diabetic BB Wistar rats is the product of increased de novo synthesis of CPT protein brought about by regulation at the transcriptional level. Additional control of the amount of CPT may be via the regulation of RNA processing and turnover and enzyme insertion into the mitochondrial membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Serum factors characteristically altered in the diabetic state, e.g., glucose, ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate), and somatomedin inhibitors, induce dysmorphogenesis with or without growth retardation in rodent embryos in whole-embryo culture. Furthermore, serum from diabetic animals, which contains combinations of altered factors, is teratogenic, thereby implying that the diabetic embryopathy is of a multifactorial origin. However, a detailed investigation with various combinations of factors at known concentrations to test this hypothesis has not been conducted. Therefore, we employed combinations of hyperglycemia (300 and 600 mg/dl; 16.6 and 33.3 mM), hyperketonemia (8 and 16 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate), and an 800- to 1000-Mr somatomedin-inhibitor serum fraction (at an amount equal to that found in 0.05 and 0.1 ml of serum from a diabetic rat per deciliter culture medium), which represented doses with low teratogenic potential, to determine if interactions of the factors could occur that would increase the risk of malformations in mouse embryos exposed in whole-embryo culture during gastrulation and neurulation. The results demonstrate that glucose and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate can act synergistically to produce growth retardation and additively to induce malformations. The addition of the somatomedin inhibitor exacerbates the induction of malformations produced by the ketone body and glucose. Thus, the origin of the diabetic embryopathy may be multifactorial, involving several altered maternal factors.\r"

  ".W": "Little information is available on the hemodynamic response (renal reserve) of the diabetic kidney during an acute amino acid infusion, which has been shown to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in normal humans. We recently found that the infusion of ketone bodies is able to raise GFR in both normal subjects and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the renal reserve in 15 IDDM patients with a duration of diabetes of greater than 9 yr [8 with albumin excretion rate less than 15 micrograms/min (group 1) and 7 with albumin excretion rate greater than 100 micrograms/min (group 2)] and in 8 normal subjects during amino acid infusion (33 mumol.kg-1.min-1, Travasol 10% wt/vol solution containing 0.154 mM sodium chloride concentration; Travenol, Savage, MD) and during acetoacetic sodium salt (25 mumol.kg-1.min-1) infusion. Blood glucose was clamped at euglycemic levels. The infusion of sodium acetoacetate resulted in a 10- to 15-fold increase in circulating concentrations of ketone bodies, which were similar in magnitude in normal subjects and diabetic patients. The GFR peak increase above baseline after sodium acetoacetate infusion was 28% in normal subjects and 27% in group 1 and 19% in group 2 diabetic patients. The infusion of amino acid solution produced a three- to fivefold increase in plasma concentrations of amino acids in both normal subjects and diabetic patients. The GFR peak increase above baseline after amino acid infusion was significantly lower in diabetic patients (IDDM group 1: 5%, P less than .01; IDDM group 2: 6%, P less than .01) than in normal subjects (38%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A dual-isotope technique was used to measure gastric emptying in 20 men, 18 premenopausal women, 14 postmenopausal women, and 8 postmenopausal women taking estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement. A multilumen perfusion catheter was used to measure antral motility in 6 men and 6 premenopausal women. Premenopausal women, postmenopausal women, and postmenopausal women taking oral estrogen and progesterone had slower gastric emptying of liquids than did men (p less than 0.025, less than 0.05, and less than 0.025, respectively). Both premenopausal women and postmenopausal women taking sex hormone replacement therapy had slower emptying of solids than did men (p less than 0.025 and less than 0.05) but, in contrast to liquids, postmenopausal women not on hormone replacement emptied solids at a rate similar to that of men. There were no differences in postprandial antral motility parameters between men and premenopausal women. These findings support the hypothesis that sex steroid hormones have variable inhibitory effects on gastric emptying of a mixed meal and this should be considered when studying gastric emptying in disorders that occur predominantly in premenopausal women.\r"

Upper gut perfusion manometry (3 h fasting, 2 h fed) was performed and compared with data from similarly studied healthy laboratory controls (n = 15). Only 1 of 8 scleroderma patients had an interdigestive motor complex during the 3-h fasting period [0.1 +/- 0.1 (SEM) for systemic sclerosis vs. 1.4 +/- 0.16 (SEM) for controls, p less than 0.05]; 2 other patients had fasting duodenal incoordinated bursts of phasic pressure activity in the duodenum or proximal jejunum. Distal antral motility index [MI = In (sum of amplitude x number of contractions + 1)] was lower (12.4 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01) than that in controls (14.4 +/- 0.14); both the amplitude and frequency of antral pressure activity were lower (p less than 0.05) in systemic sclerosis. The intestinal fed pattern was characterized by reduced amplitude and frequency of contractions in 6 patients; 2 patients had excessive phasic or tonic small bowel pressure activity, or both. Thus, antral hypomotility is present in most symptomatic scleroderma patients; proximal small bowel postcibal motility is characteristically reduced; a minority of such patients have incoordianted fasting or postcibal hypermotility suggestive of a neuropathy. Manometry identifies the type and region of dysmotility in systemic sclerosis; our results suggest that there are neuropathic and myopathic stages of the upper gut involvement in systemic sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The role played by muscarinic receptor subtypes in the regulation of the migrating myoelectric complex was investigated in 7 dogs chronically implanted with bipolar electrodes along the small intestine. Pirenzepine (3-300 micrograms/kg i.v.) and atropine (1-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) were used as selective and unselective antagonist, respectively. Atropine (30 micrograms/kg) significantly delayed the onset of the next complex. On the contrary, pirenzepine displayed a biphasic action: low doses (less than 100 micrograms/kg) shortened the cycle period, whereas at 300 micrograms/kg the drug behaved like atropine. Pirenzepine affected the cycle period in the low-dose range by reducing the length of phase I. Both atropine and pirenzepine impaired the migration of the ongoing complex, and significantly reduced the migration velocity of the following one. These findings suggest that the initiation of the migrating myoelectric complex in the dog is under an inhibitory influence mediated by the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype; on the other hand, M2 receptor activation is needed for the onset of the activity front. Finally, both receptor subtypes determine the normal migration of phase III.\r"

Viruses are for the most part digested in the stomach. Very few well-preserved B particles, i.e., the infective particles, are allowed to enter through a process of endocytosis, mainly in the newborn-type epithelial cells. These are epithelial cells with a very rich absorptive apparatus, characteristic of newborn rodents. The adult-type absorptive cells and the M cells of the Peyer's patches might be partly involved.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the naturally occurring bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) with their 7-methyl analogues (3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid and 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid) on gallstone formation and prevention and cholesterol metabolism in the prairie dog. Sixty animals were fed a semipurified diet, containing 0.4% cholesterol, with one of the following acids (0.1%): chenodeoxycholic, cholic, 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic, or 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid. This concentration of dietary bile acids amounts to a dose of 27-30 mg/kg.day. After 8 wk, 89% of control animals had gallstones and 94% had cholesterol crystals. Chenodeoxycholic and 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acids decreased the incidence of gallstones to 50%. Cholic acid and 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-tri-hydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid did not prevent gallstone formation. The liver cholesterol level was decreased by chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas cholic and 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acids increased serum and liver cholesterol. Each administered bile acid became the predominant biliary bile acid and 7-methyl analogues did not increase secondary bile acids. Fecal analysis of radioactive metabolites using 14C-labeled 7-methyl analogues showed that these compounds are resistant to bacterial 7-dehydroxylation. It was concluded that 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid inhibited gallstone formation as effectively as chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas both cholic and 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acids were not effective. The effects of 7-methyl analogues on the parameters of cholesterol metabolism that we studied were similar to those of their parent compounds, chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids. Thus, 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid but not 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-7 beta-methyl-5 beta-cholanoic acid offers promise in cholelitholytic therapy for the prevention and possibly dissolution of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

  ".U": "89078882\r", 
  ".W": "In 29 chloralose-urethane anesthetized dogs, a manometric assembly was inserted through a gastrostomy to monitor pressure of the pyloric region with a sleeve sensor. Antral and duodenal contractions were monitored with both manometric sideholes and serosal strain gauges. An additional tube channel allowed intraduodenal infusions 1-2 cm aborad from the pylorus. Intraluminal infusion of hydrochloric acid (0.1 N, 0.92 ml/min, for 2 min) reproducibly caused activation of motor activity in the pyloric region and peristaltic duodenal activity. Proximal duodenal activity probably contributed to the total phasic response recorded in the pylorus region. Excitatory responses could also be elicited by infusion of phenyl-biguanide (stimulant of sensory nerve endings), but not by control infusions with diluent (Krebs' buffer or saline). The motor response of the pyloric region to intraduodenal acid was blocked by intraduodenal application of 2% xylocaine. Atropine (30 micrograms/kg i.v. and 100 micrograms i.a.) or hexamethonium (10 mg/kg and 1 mg i.a.) markedly reduced or blocked the acid-induced pyloric motor response of this region but propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v. and 100 micrograms i.a.), phentolamine (1.5 mg/kg i.v. and 100 micrograms i.a.), or naloxone (200 micrograms/kg and 20 micrograms i.a.) had no effect. We believe these observations show the existence of a reflex from the duodenum to the pylorus in response to intraluminal stimuli mediated by a chain of cholinergic nerves. In the dog, endogenous opioid peptides do not contribute to the excitatory reflex pathway activated by intraduodenal acid or phenyl-biguanide. As intraluminal acid in the duodenum activates this reflex, it may play a role in the physiologic and pathophysiologic role of gastric emptying in this species.\r"

A beneficial effect on the amylase and lipase content in serum and ascites was found, but no effect was observed on enzyme concentration in pancreatic tissue or on the degree of histologically detectable organ destruction. Therapeutic administration of FOY-305 had a significantly positive influence when infused directly, 5 and 30 min after the operation, whereas enzyme increase and organ destruction remained unaffected. FOY-305 showed a beneficial effect when given prophylactically or therapeutically at the beginning of the pancreatitis induced by a CDE diet, with no significant change in enzyme increase and degree of organ destruction. The favorable effect on survival time and rate in the early phase of these two severe experimental forms of pancreatitis may justify an evaluation of FOY-305 in a clinically controlled study.\r"

The time intervals between successive migrating motor complexes in the antrum (145 +/- 11 vs. 135 +/- 15 min, mean +/- SE) or small intestine (133 + 10 vs. 137 +/- 16 min) were not significantly (p greater than 0.4) altered by pancreatectomy, but the antral motility index (the sum of the antral contractions in a 15-min period) was greater after pancreatectomy (53 +/- 6 vs. 27 +/- 4; p less than 0.05). Pancreatectomy led to undetectable plasma concentrations of pancreatic polypeptide, but had no effect on absolute concentrations of plasma motilin or on the cycling of plasma motilin in association with the duodenal migrating motor complex. We conclude that the pancreas and pancreatic polypeptide play little, if any, role in controlling canine interdigestive motility of the upper gut.\r"

The effects of intravenous infusion of somatostatin on hepatic bile flow and biliary electrolytes and secretion of biliary lipids were studied in 7 patients with complete biliary drainage who had been operated on for choledocholithiasis. Somatostatin, 250 microgram/h, was found to decrease the hepatic bile secretion by approximately 30%. The peptide also reduced the outputs of bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids and the outputs of sodium, potassium, and chloride. The concentrations of the biliary lipids were not significantly changed. Somatostatin inhibited the erythritol clearance in the 2 patients studied by approximately 25%. The present study thus provides evidence that somatostatin inhibits bile formation in humans. It appears as if the reduction in bile production is mainly due to decreased canalicular bile flow. It is possible that this effect of somatostatin is attributable to inhibition of bile acid synthesis or of transport-secretion of bile acids, or both.\r"

Our patient presented with clinical, manometric, endoscopic, and radiographic features of achalasia that occurred in conjunction with a pancreatic pseudocyst extending into the mediastinum. Documentation of this unique relationship was made on two occasions after episodes of complicated pancreatitis and was confirmed by restoration of normal esophageal function after drainage of the pseudocyst. Onset of dysphagia occurring in association with pancreatitis suggests the presence of a pseudocyst and secondary achalasia.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphate transport was studied in isolated brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from human jejunum. Transport consisted of two components: passive diffusion across the brush border, and sodium-dependent, carrier-mediated uptake. Both carrier-mediated transport and passive diffusion of phosphate were significantly greater at pH 6.1 than at pH 7.4. Sodium-dependent uptake was saturable at both pH values; the apparent Km was not affected by pH, whereas Vmax was significantly greater at pH 6.1 (179.3 vs. 118.4 pM/mg per 15 s). Phosphate uptake was half-maximally stimulated by a sodium concentration of 34 mM at pH 7.4, and a sodium concentration of 76 mM at pH 6.1. At both pH values, Hill coefficients were greater than 1 and were unaffected by pH. Moreover, sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was electroneutral at pH 7.4 and electrogenic at pH 6.1. These data suggest that at acid and neutral pH, both monovalent and divalent phosphate are transported across the human jejunal brush border membrane. The transport of each phosphate molecule is associated with the cotransport of two sodium ions.\r"

When the acid exposure was performed simultaneously with an arterial bleeding of 0.6 ml/100 g body wt (10% of the total blood volume), the increase in duodenal HCO3- secretion was totally abolished. When the acid exposure and bleeding procedures were performed at the same time in rats with bilaterally cut splanchnic nerves, alkaline secretion increased by 60%, as it did in the unbled rats. Direct electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerves (10 Hz, supramaximal intensity) inhibited the stimulatory effect of duodenal acid exposure on alkaline secretion. Taken together, the data suggest that the sympathetic nervous system, because of splanchnic nerve activation, inhibits the acid-induced increase in duodenal HCO3- secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Osteonecrosis is a serious complication of steroid therapy characterized by death of all the cellular elements of bone. We describe a series of patients with steroid-induced osteonecrosis in inflammatory bowel disease. Seven of 161 patients (4.3%) treated with corticosteroids for inflammatory bowel disease over a 10-yr period developed osteonecrosis. The median age at the onset of inflammatory bowel disease was 20 yr and for osteonecrosis the median age was 28 yr. Patients had received steroids for a mean duration of 42 wk with a mean daily dose of 26 mg/day and a mean cumulative lifetime prednisone dose of 7 g. Osteonecrosis occurred within 6 mo of the last administration of steroid in all patients. It presented with joint pain in the hip or knee and was frequently mistaken for the arthralgia of steroid withdrawal or the arthropathy of inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple joints were involved in 6 of the 7 patients. Surgery for the joint disease was required in 4 of the 7 patients. The median duration of follow-up was 2 yr. Five of the 7 patients continued to have significant joint pain and disability that limited their activity. We conclude that inflammatory bowel disease predisposes to steroid-induced osteonecrosis. The age of patients is younger, and the dose and duration are considerably lower than that reported for steroid-induced osteonecrosis in other disease states. Bone scans or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed in patients with joint pain who are receiving or have recently received corticosteroid therapy. Early detection and treatment may prevent the crippling long-term complications of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronate, HA) and type III procollagen N-terminal peptide were measured in jejunal perfusion fluid in an attempt to elucidate the turnover of connective tissue components in the small bowel in health and disease. In healthy controls (n = 16) the average concentration of hyaluronic acid in jejunal perfusion fluid was 12.2 +/- 2 micrograms/L (mean +/- SEM); the mean serum concentration was 22 +/- 7 micrograms/L. The type III procollagen N-terminal peptide concentration in jejunal fluid was 0.12 +/- 0.02 micrograms/L; the mean serum concentration was 12 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L. The albumin concentration in perfusion fluid was, on average, 0.04% of the serum values. Patients with celiac disease (n = 7) and Crohn's disease (n = 10) had normal serum levels of HA and type III procollagen N-terminal peptide. The jejunal secretion rate of HA was significantly increased in both disease groups and on average about three times higher than that in controls. The secretion rate of type III procollagen N-terminal peptide was not altered in celiac disease but increased more than three times in Crohn's disease. Habitual alcoholics investigated after alcohol withdrawal also had significantly increased jejunal secretion of HA but not of type III procollagen N-terminal peptide. In contrast, patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and similar ethanol intake had normal secretion of both substances. The findings of the study indicate that the secretion of HA into the jejunal lumen in health is considerable, possibly reflecting the rapid turnover of the intestinal mucosa. The enhanced jejunal secretion of HA in patients with celiac disease and Crohn's disease may be indicative of enhanced connective tissue response due to inflammation, but signs compatible with enhanced jejunal synthesis of type III collagen are only found in Crohn's disease. The HA secretion data in alcoholics might reflect (a) the active regeneration of the intestinal mucosa when ethanol is discontinued and (b) a possible role of the liver in this activity.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies show that oral ingestion of iron does not cause a positive stool guaiac reaction. However, all in vitro studies show that iron does cause a positive guaiac reaction and some in vivo studies have shown a positive stool guaiac reaction in response to oral iron. This study examines this unresolved question. Twenty-five normal volunteers were given 900 mg of ferrous sulfate a day. Two Hemoccult II and two HemoQuant tests were obtained before and during iron therapy. All Hemoccult II tests were negative before and after oral iron. Four HemoQuant tests were slightly elevated before oral iron and one was slightly elevated after oral iron. Ferrous sulfate, 300 mg, was dissolved in 1 L of water. The solution was acidic (pH = 3.9) and produced a positive Hemoccult II test. When the solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide to a pH of greater than or equal to 6.0, iron precipitated out and the mixture no longer produced a positive Hemoccult II reaction. Our data show that ferric iron (Fe3+) in solution will give a positive guaiac reaction directly and ferrous iron (Fe2+) will give a positive guaiac reaction after hydrogen peroxide is added because it oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+. Iron solutions are acidic and when titrated toward a neutral pH, the iron is precipitated out and the solution is then guaiac-negative. Thus, our in vivo data confirm most previous in vivo studies; furthermore, the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies can be explained as a pH-dependent phenomenon of in vitro iron solutions. Oral iron should not cause a positive guaiac reaction, and the HemoQuant results show no increase in occult blood loss in subjects on oral iron therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The thesis of this paper is that gastropathy associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the most frequent and, in aggregate, the most severe drug side effect in the United States. This work is based on a consecutive series of 2400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis followed prospectively for an average of 3.5 yr by ARAMIS, the American Rheumatism Association Medical Information System. We present a preliminary exploration of the magnitude of the problem, the population at risk, and the patients within that population who are at particularly high risk. Patients on NSAIDs had a hazard ratio for gastrointestinal (GI) hospitalization that was 6.45 times that of patients not on NSAIDs. Characteristically, high-risk patients for GI hospitalization and GI death are older, have had previous upper abdominal pain, have previously stopped NSAIDs for GI side effects, and have previously used antacids or H2-receptor antagonists for GI side effects. They also are frequently on corticosteroids. In contrast, patients attributing relatively minor symptoms to the drug tend to be younger and more frequently female. Our preliminary analysis is univariate and, as these variables are interdependent, firm conclusions regarding the relative importance of these risk factors will require reevaluating our data base as it is expanded using multivariate analysis. The syndrome of NSAID-associated gastropathy can be estimated to account for at least 2600 deaths and 20,000 hospitalizations each year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis alone.\r"

Four groups have found antibodies to bovine TSH (bTSH-Ab) in Graves' disease patients in a TSH binding-inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII) RRA that uses [125I]bTSH. In this assay serum samples containing bTSH-Ab give highly negative TBII values. The purpose of this study was to look for any clinical significance of potential idiotypic-antiidiotypic network regulation related to bTSH-Ab. Twenty-one (0.49%) of 4285 Graves' disease patients had TBII values less than the mean -4 SD of normal subjects. In all 21, bTSH-Ab was found by incubation of [125I]bTSH with the patient's serum, and significant inhibition of binding of bTSH-Ab to bTSH by human TSH was found in only 3 of these serum samples. We investigated next whether the binding site of the anti-TSH-Ab mimicked the TSH receptor-binding site. Binding of [125I]bTSH to bTSH-Ab-positive serum was not inhibited by bTSH-Ab-negative, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin-positive [(+)], and/or TBII(+) immunoglobulin G. In one patient with human TSH-Ab, TSH-Ab appeared and disappeared, and when TSH-Ab was negative, TBII was positive. Inhibition of [125I]bTSH binding to TSH-Ab by the same patient's serum when that patient was serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin(+), TBII(+), and TSH-Ab-negative was sought but not found. Changes in serum TSH-Ab activity and disease activity were not correlated in this patient. In six untreated patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism with bTSH-Ab, the serum T3 and T4 concentrations and the time required to become euthyroid during antithyroid drug treatment were not significantly different from those in 52 such patients without bTSH-Ab. These data suggest that bTSH-Ab is not an anti-id-Ab to TRAb and that TSH-Ab does not directly modulate the activity of Graves' disease.\r"

The total numbers of receptors per cell were similar in the two groups [young, 1645 +/- 206 +/- SE); elderly, 1707 +/- 120], as were the basal levels of beta-adrenoceptor internalization (young, 8.85 +/- 1.09%; elderly, 8.73 +/- 1.35%). Incubation in the presence of isoproterenol resulted in dose-dependent internalization of receptors. The EC50 values for isoproterenol-induced internalization were similar in the young (20.7 +/- 3.5 nmol/L) and elderly groups (26.9 +/- 4.4 nmol/L). These results suggest that altered receptor internalization does not contribute to impaired beta-adrenoceptor function in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "The value of intermittent slow release sodium fluoride treatment in the management of osteoporosis was studied by a comprehensive metabolic and clinical assessment during a long term trial. Its effect was compared with that of a large dose of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] given for a short period preceding each fluoride treatment period in another group of randomly selected patients. The 24 patients in group I (3 idiopathic and 21 postmenopausal) received cyclic treatment in repeated 5-month cycles; each cycle was initiated by 1,25-(OH)2D (2 micrograms/day) for 2 weeks, followed for 3 months by sodium fluoride (slow release, 25 mg twice daily) with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (50 micrograms twice weekly) and calcium supplements (to bring total calcium intake to 1500 mg/day), and was concluded by 6 weeks of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium supplementation without sodium fluoride. The 21 patients in group II (3 idiopathic and 18 postmenopausal) received the same treatment, except for the omission of 1,25-(OH)2D. In both groups, the serum fluoride level was maintained within 5-10 mumol/L (95-190 ng/mL) during fluoride treatment, and serum osteocalcin concentrations correlated positively with the duration of treatment. However, vertebral bone mineral content (L2-L4) did not increase significantly in group I, whereas it rose significantly in group II (fractional change, +0.031/2.4 yr in group I vs. + 0.118/2.9 yr in group II; P less than 0.005). Although bone histomorphometric analyses disclosed overall improvement in both groups, only group II had significant increases in the mineral apposition rate [0.5 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) to 1.4 +/- 0.2 micron/day; P less than 0.05] and the adjusted apposition rate (0.2 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 micron/day; P = 0.04). The vertebral fracture rate significantly declined in both groups, but more so in group II. Excluding the first year of treatment, the fracture rate during treatment in group II of 0.03/patient yr was significantly lower than that of 0.28/patient yr in group I (P less than 0.05). The treatment was well tolerated in both groups; only 16% of patients had either gastrointestinal or rheumatic complications. We conclude that intermittent sodium fluoride treatment without 1,25-(OH)2D provides safe and effective treatment of osteoporosis, marked by formation of new adequately mineralized bone, a rise in vertebral bone mass, and reduced frequency of vertebral fractures. The addition of 1,25-(OH)2D treatment before initiation of each fluoride phase yielded a less favorable response.\r"

  ".W": "High serum PRL and low zinc (Zn) levels are common findings in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF); in such patients serum Zn concentrations have been reported to be inversely correlated to serum PRL levels. Moreover, Zn regulates both thymus growth and the biological activity of the thymic hormone thymulin, and PRL-thymic interrelationships have been described. To determine whether hypozincemia alters serum PRL and plasma thymulin concentrations in CRF, 9 men with CRF treated by chronic hemodialysis were given 400 mg/day Zn sulfate, orally (4.96 meq/day Zn), for 6 months. Before treatment, serum PRL levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in these patients than in normal men [mean, 28.7 +/- 20.7 (+/-SD) vs. 7.5 +/- 3.7 micrograms/L], and their serum PRL response to TRH (200 micrograms, iv) was impaired (mean maximal percent increase, 38.2 +/- 10.9 vs. 641 +/- 335; P less than 0.001). The plasma Zn-bound bioactive thymulin titer (1.3 +/- 0.7 1/log2), total thymulin titer (Zn-bound plus Zn-unbound forms, 2.1 +/- 0.8 1/log2), and serum Zn (13.1 +/- 2.4 mumol/L) were lower (P less than 0.001) in men with CRF than in normal men. Zn therapy did not induce any significant change in basal and TRH-stimulated serum PRL levels, while serum Zn levels significantly increased, reaching the normal range after the first week of treatment (17.8 +/- 6.3 mumol/L). Plasma total thymulin increased rapidly, reaching normal levels after 1 week, but Zn-bound thymulin increased modestly during the first month of treatment and more after 3 and 6 months of treatment. There was no age-related difference in plasma thymulin levels during therapy. We conclude that oral Zn administration in patients with CRF significantly increases both total and Zn-bound thymulin, but does not modify basal and TRH-stimulated serum PRL levels. The observation that Zn supplementation markedly increased plasma thymulin levels in uremic patients suggests that Zn is a potent stimulus for thymic hormone synthesis, and it can reverse the age-related diminution of thymic activity in CRF patients.\r"

WHR was significantly and positively correlated with plasma concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, and low and very low density lipoprotein (LDL and VLDL) cholesterol and inversely correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. STR followed these trends, though less strongly, in relation to plasma triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Pronounced differences were found between regional adiposity patterns in their relationships to lipoprotein subfractions, as determined by analytic ultracentrifugation. WHR was negatively correlated with HDL2 (flotation rate F(1.2) 3.5-9), positively with small LDL (S.f 0-7), intermediate density lipoprotein (S.f 12-20), and VLDL (S.f 20-400), while STR correlated with larger LDL (S.f 7-12) and larger VLDL (S.f 60-400). Overall adiposity was not significantly associated with plasma lipoprotein levels after adjusting for regional adiposity patterns. Plasma sex hormone-binding globulin and percent free testosterone were associated with regional adiposity, but did not account for the correlations between WHR and lipoproteins. WHR and STR are measures of fat distribution that correlate with plasma lipoprotein profiles consistent with cardiovascular disease risk and have different relationships to lipoprotein mass subfractions.\r"

  ".W": "The protective action of estrogens on bone mass may be mediated by an increase in calcitonin (CT) secretion. We reevaluated this hypothesis using a method for measuring CT in extracts of serum that allows sensitive specific measurement of CT monomer. We studied seven healthy postmenopausal women before and on the 7th and 28th days of each of three 4-week treatment periods: estrogen (estradiol valerate; 2 mg/day), calcium supplement (1500 mg/day), and estrogen plus calcium; the three cycles were separated by intervals of 4 weeks. Serum extractable CT (exCT) levels were measured before and after a short calcium stimulation test (2 mg Ca/kg in 5 min) to assess the C-cell secretory response on each day. Estrogen had the expected biological effects, decreasing (P less than 0.05) serum gonadotropin concentrations and fasting or 24-h urinary calcium excretion. The calcium supplement caused a significant increase in 24-h urinary calcium excretion. However, there was no increase in basal or stimulated serum exCT levels during any of the three cycles. On the contrary, basal serum exCT concentrations decreased slightly but significantly during estrogen treatment from 1.9 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE) to 1.5 +/- 0.4 ng/L on day 7 and 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/L on day 28 (P less than 0.05). This decrease in basal exCT levels did not occur during the combined estrogen and calcium administration period, probably because the slight decrease in serum calcium induced by estrogen did not occur during combined estrogen and calcium administration. In summary, estrogens do not stimulate CT secretion; variations in serum exCT levels appear to be related to the changes in bone metabolism induced by estrogens.\r"

  ".W": "The signal that initiates and maintains the developmental change in LHRH and, consequently, LH secretion in primates, thus regulating the tempo of puberty, is not known. Given the close association between reproductive development and bone maturation, we examined the hypothesis that GH was involved in developmental increases in LH release, specifically by augmenting the decrease in estradiol (E2) negative feedback inhibition of LH that characterizes late puberty in primates. Recombinant human GH (rhGH; 250 micrograms/kg) was given (sc) three times weekly to immature female rhesus monkeys to determine if developmental increases in basal serum LH would occur at an earlier age, and if menarche and first ovulation also would be advanced. The study groups included intact females receiving rhGH (INT + GH; n = 5), intact control animals (INT; n = 6), ovariectomized females receiving E2 plus rhGH (E2OVX + GH; n = 5), and E2-treated ovariectomized control monkeys (E2OVX; n = 4). The females were studied from 20 months of age until their serum LH levels increased (E2OVX groups) or until the occurrence of first ovulation (intact groups). After 12 months of rhGH treatment, the crown-rump lengths were significantly increased, regardless of ovarian status, an effect maintained in the intact females through 21 months of treatment. The mean age at the time of the initial rise in serum LH was advanced by rhGH treatment in intact females (29.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 31.3 +/- 0.3 months), but not E2OVX females. Subsequent maturational elevations in LH secretion were similar in the E2OVS + GH and E2OVX animals even after an incremental increase in E2. Ages at menarche were similar in the INT + GH and INT groups, whereas first ovulation was significantly advanced in three of five INT + GH females (31.5 +/- 0.7 months) compared to that in INT females (43.5 +/- 0.3 months). The remaining INT + GH females ovulated at an age (42.4 +/- 0.4 months) similar to that of INT females. Those females that ovulated by 32 months had higher skeletal maturity scores than the later ovulating INT females, with the other INT + GH females being intermediate. Furthermore, rhGH resulted in a significant increase in serum E2 levels within 12 h of injection, which remained elevated through 24 h. This effect of rhGH on ovarian E2 secretion did not occur until females had shown elevations in basal serum LH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The S/G2M fraction was determined by means of DNA flow cytometry, and TKA was determined by radioenzyme assay. The S/G2M fraction of AFTA (n = 15, median; 7.1%; range, 3.2-9.2%) exceeded the S/G2M fraction of normal thyroid tissue (n = 8; median, 2.8%; range, 2.3-4.0%; P = 0.008) and in 12 of 13 AFTA was 1.2- to 2.3-fold higher than the S/G2M fraction in the corresponding PNT (median, 4.0%; range, 2.5-6.7%; P = 0.0022). TKA of AFTA (n = 15; median, 681 microIU/mg; range, 432-854 microIU/mg) exceeded TKA of normal thyroid tissue (n = 8; median, 356 microIU/mg; range, 194-426 microIU/mg; P = 0.0001) and was 1.1- to 4.2-fold increased compared with TKA activity in the corresponding PNT (median, 430 microIU/mg; range, 162-570 microIU/mg; P = 0.001). In the absence of measurable serum TSH there was a constant increase in the S/G2M fractions and the TKA in AFTA vs. those in PNT. In patients treated with methimazole with serum TSH concentrations of 0.5 mIU/L or more, the S/G2M fraction and TKA in both AFTA and PNT were significantly higher than those in untreated patients with serum TSH concentrations of 0.5 mIU/L or less. In the majority of AFTA, functional autonomy and increased DNA synthesis are concomitant phenomena. Although TSH may stimulate DNA synthesis in both AFTA and PNT, measurable serum TSH concentrations are apparently not essential for DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "A rare form of male pseudohermaphroditism is characterized by the persistence of Mullerian derivatives in phenotypic males. To determine the etiology of this syndrome, we studied the expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in six boys, including three brothers, with the persistent Mullerian duct syndrome. All except one presented with an inguinal hernia containing the Mullerian derivatives, and in two boys the hernial sac contained the contralateral testis. AMH was normally expressed in the testicular tissue of two patients, as shown by bioassay of anti-Mullerian activity and immunocytochemistry. The testicular tissue of the other patients had no detectable bioactive or immunoreactive AMH, yet they expressed AMH mRNA with a normal transcription initiation site and in the amount expected for their age. These results prove the heterogeneity of the persistent Mullerian duct syndrome and suggest that it may sometimes involve peripheral insensitivity to AMH.\r"

A significant increase in the percentage of H-Y-positive lymphocytes was found in both hirsute women with idiopathic hirsutism [13.4 +/- 2.9% (+/- SD); n = 15] and hirsute women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (13.0 +/- 2.8%; n = 12) compared to that in normal women (10.0 +/- 1.9%; n = 30; P less than 0.0005). Plasma testosterone and androstenedione concentrations, % H-Y+ lymphocytes, and hirsutism scores diminished during oral cyproterone acetate (50 mg/day) and percutaneous estradiol (3 mg/day) treatment. Significant correlations between % H-Y+ lymphocytes and hirsutism scores (P less than 0.001), % H-Y+ lymphocytes and plasma T concentrations (P less than 0.01) were found. We conclude that 1) women can produce H-Y antigen in the same way as men; 2) hirsutism is associated with an increase in H-Y antigen; and 3) the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate reduces H-Y antigen expression on lymphocytes.\r"

The young and elderly men had similar basal LH pulse frequencies, but the frequency of high amplitude (greater than 2 IU/L) LH pulses, mean LH pulse amplitude, maximal LH pulse amplitude and pulse area, were lower in the elderly men. Naltrexone administration (40 mg at 0630 and 2200 h the day before blood sampling and at 0630 h, 30 min before starting frequent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 12 h) to young men (n = 8) induced a significant increase in individual mean baseline plasma LH levels, LH pulse frequency, and the sum of LH pulse amplitudes. In elderly men (n = 11) only a borderline significant increase in baseline plasma LH levels occurred, and neither LH pulse frequency nor the sum of the amplitudes of LH pulses increased. We suggest that in elderly men either opioid tone or the response of the gonadotrophs to endogenous LHRH is decreased.\r"

  ".W": "Potent, specific, and nontoxic inhibitors of aromatase would be useful for experimental studies and for use in the treatment of breast cancer and other disorders. We evaluated the effects of CGS 16949A, a nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase activity, in 12 postmenopausal women with breast cancer by measuring plasma and/or urinary androgens and estrogens after oral administration of CGS 16949A at doses ranging from 0.6-16 mg daily; each dose was given for 2 weeks. The 0.6-mg daily dose partially lowered estrogen levels, and maximum reduction occurred at doses of 2-16 mg daily. The fall in plasma and urinary estrogens without a concomitant fall in plasma androgens confirmed the blockade of aromatase activity. The degree of estrogen reduction was greatest for urinary estrone [to 27 +/- 3% (+/- SE) of basal], followed in order by plasma estrone sulfate (30 +/- 4%), plasma estrone (32 +/- 6%), urine estradiol (45 +/- 5%), and plasma estradiol (65 +/- 5%). Use of gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques revealed similar patterns of reduction in catechol estrogens, estriol, and total urinary estrogens, suggesting that CGS 16949A does not alter the pathways of estrogen metabolism. The degree of estrogen reduction was remarkably similar to that caused with aminoglutethimide. At doses of 4-16 mg daily, CGS 16949A inhibited the C21-hydroxylase enzyme as well, based on concomitant rises in plasma androstenedione, testosterone, and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. This effect was insufficient to lower urinary cortisol excretion during the study. However, a statistically significant blunting of plasma cortisol responses to ACTH occurred with the 16-mg daily dose. No changes in plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels or in thyroid, hematological, liver, or renal parameters were found. No significant side-effects of the medication were encountered. CGS 16949A appears to be a specific inhibitor of aromatase at doses below 4 mg daily and to lack apparent side-effects or toxic actions at doses up to 16 mg daily. This agent shows promise as a potent aromatase inhibitor for physiological and clinical studies.\r"

Embolization resulted in total occlusion in 53 (69%), subtotal occlusion in 19 (25%) and partial occlusion in 3 (1 intentional). Two embolizations failed to reduce flow. Thus, 72 (95%) of 76 embolizations in which complete occlusion was the intended result resulted in total or subtotal occlusion. Analysis of the results demonstrates that completely occluded collateral vessels were longer and had a smaller diameter than did incompletely occluded vessels. Complications included six cases of inadvertent embolization to the pulmonary arteries (n = 5) or the aorta (n = 1); three were retrieved and three were left without symptoms. In addition, there was a case of severe hemolysis after intentional partial occlusion of a Blalock-Taussig shunt. The results demonstrate that coil embolization can be an effective procedure for managing a wide variety of aorto-pulmonary collateral vessels and shunts in children with congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".U": "89080017\r", 
  ".W": "During the 35 month period ending December 1987, 30 children, aged 14 days to 13 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of unoperated aortic coarctation with resultant reduction in coarctation gradient from 43.6 +/- 20.4 to 9.5 +/- 7.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). None of the patients required immediate surgical intervention. On the basis of results of 6 to 30 month follow-up catheterization data in 20 children, the patients were classified as follows: Group A, 13 patients with good results (gradient less than or equal to 20 mm Hg and no recoarctation on angiograms) and Group B, 7 patients with fair or poor results (gradient greater than 21 mm Hg with or without recoarctation on angiography). No patient developed aortic aneurysm at the site of angioplasty. Thirty variables were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis and four factors were identified as risk factors for development of recoarctation: 1) age less than 12 months, 2) aortic isthmus less than 2/3 the size of the ascending aorta immediately proximal to the right innominate artery, 3) coarcted aortic segment less than 3.5 mm before dilation, and 4) coarcted aortic segment less than 6 mm after angioplasty. The identification of risk factors may help in selection of patients for balloon angioplasty. Avoiding or minimizing the number of risk factors may help reduce the chance of recoarctation after angioplasty. The intermediate-term follow-up results with regard to recoarctation are comparable with those after surgical repair of coarctation. Recoarctation after angioplasty was dealt with by repeat balloon angioplasty or surgical resection for those requiring treatment and clinical follow-up for the remaining children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular enlargement and marked global systolic dysfunction in five. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreased left ventricular systolic function in all five so studied. Stainable iron was present in all endomyocardial biopsy specimens from the five patients with decreased left ventricular systolic function. Histologically, iron was detected only within the sarcoplasm, and its extent varied inversely with ventricular function. Thus, cardiac hemochromatosis represents a storage rather than an infiltrative disease. These results indicate that stainable iron is consistently observed in endomyocardial biopsy specimens from patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. Iron staining is recommended for endomyocardial biopsy specimens from patients with idiopathic cardiac dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) effectively prevents death due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Some patients who need an AICD also require cardiac pacing to treat symptomatic bradycardia, bradycardia after defibrillation, or to provide a rate floor to reduce the frequency of bradycardia-related ventricular arrhythmias. Some patients also can benefit from antitachycardia pacing. A mapping technique to implant a pacemaker and AICD sensing leads is presented. For patients with a pacemaker who later need an AICD, the left ventricle is mapped with use of the AICD rate-sensing electrodes to identify a site at which the minimal pacemaker stimulus and maximal ventricular electrogram amplitudes are recorded. An external cardioverter-defibrillator that has amplifiers similar to those in the AICD is used to monitor the rate-sensing electrogram. For patients with an implanted AICD, pacemaker implantation is undertaken by mapping the right ventricle with the pacemaker lead while the AICD is in standby mode; the AICD beep monitor is then used to determine a site where pacemaker stimulus detection by the AICD does not occur. Eight patients underwent implantation of a combined AICD-pacemaker system (four ventricular antitachycardia pacemakers, three ventricular demand pacemakers and one atrial demand pacemaker). Neither inhibition of AICD arrhythmia detection nor double counting occurred. Satisfactory AICD-pacemaker function was shown in all patients postoperatively, and no pacemaker malfunction was observed. Thus, with currently available technology, a combined AICD-pacemaker system can be implanted with satisfactory function of both devices and without adverse device-device interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-five patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation were treated with oral sotalol (80 to 480 mg twice daily). Sotalol was withdrawn in 11 patients because of continued inducibility of ventricular tachycardia at the time of follow-up electrophysiologic study. Therefore, the clinical effectiveness of sotalol could be evaluated in 54 patients followed up for 11.5 +/- 6 months (range 0.2 to 25). The actuarial incidence of successful sotalol therapy was 54 +/- 13% at 6 months and 47 +/- 13% at 12 months. In 39 patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing while receiving oral sotalol, the drug prevented the reinduction of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 8 (20%). During follow-up study, arrhythmia recurred in 1 (17%) of 6 patients whose ventricular tachycardia was noninducible with oral sotalol and in 8 (44%) of 18 with inducible tachycardia but who were continued on oral sotalol therapy. Adverse effects were noted in 28 patients (42%), requiring drug withdrawal in 13 (22%) and dose reduction after hospital discharge in 10 (15%). Exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmia occurred in six patients (9%), one of whom had associated hypokalemia. Sotalol is frequently useful in the control of intractable, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and its efficacy appears to be predicted by programmed stimulation. However, there is a high rate of limiting side effects, which precludes its use in a large number of patients, and a substantial risk of arrhythmia exacerbation.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-six patients who had coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia underwent surgical treatment to eliminate or facilitate control of the arrhythmia. Surgery was performed without the assistance of intraoperative mapping techniques. Forty-three patients underwent preoperative or postoperative electrophysiologic testing, or both, and antiarrhythmic therapy was added, when indicated, postoperatively. The patients had a mean age of 63 years, a mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction of 27 +/- 9% and a mean preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 23 +/- 9 mm Hg. Twenty-one patients (46%) underwent surgical treatment within 2 months of their last myocardial infarction. The overall operative mortality rate was 6.5% (three patients). Eighteen of the 43 operative survivors were discharged from the hospital on no antiarrhythmic therapy, whereas 25 received additional antiarrhythmic treatment. During a mean follow-up period of 36 months (range 2 to 88), there were 13 deaths; eight patients died suddenly, three died of congestive heart failure, one of myocardial reinfarction and one from a noncardiac cause. The overall cumulative cardiac mortality rate at 1, 2 and 3 years was 16, 22 and 35%, respectively, whereas the sudden cardiac death rate was 5, 12 and 20%, respectively. This experience suggests that high risk patients who undergo nonguided surgery for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and left ventricular aneurysm have a relatively low surgical mortality and a better long-term survival than previously reported. However, if utilized, such an approach must be systematically supported by perioperative electrophysiologic testing to determine the need for supplemental antiarrhythmic therapy.\r"

Both the development and the regression of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy were ascertained in 61 subjects (17 men and 44 women). During the course of development of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension (including borderline cases) was noted in 83.3% of the subjects. The most common pattern of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy development was high voltage, followed by ST-T changes. In about half of these cases, the condition of hypertrophy regression was associated with lowering of blood pressure, marked by the disappearance of high voltage ECG readings.\r"

Ventricular pacing was accomplished with a computer-controlled, constant voltage pacemaker that permitted rapid determination of pacing threshold. Defibrillation at various energy levels was administered during ventricular pacing and after ventricular fibrillation of 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 or 120 s duration in the 20 dogs. Defibrillation during pacing or within 15 s after initiation of ventricular fibrillation did not significantly increase threshold, regardless of defibrillation energy or mode of delivery. Defibrillation after ventricular fibrillation lasting greater than or equal to 30 s increased (p less than 0.05) threshold determined 6 s after defibrillation. The increase in threshold (in volts) determined 6 s after defibrillation was an exponential function of fibrillation duration (30 s = 0.30 +/- 0.09 V; 45 s = 0.53 +/- 0.13 V; 60 s = 2.24 +/- 1.05 V), but was independent of defibrillation energy or mode of delivery. Threshold returned to control values 15 to 30 s after defibrillation. Cardiopulmonary bypass to maintain coronary perfusion prevented the increase in pacing threshold even after ventricular fibrillation of up to 2 min duration. Pacing threshold is not increased by transthoracic or internal defibrillation, but is increased by ventricular fibrillation of sufficient duration to create substantial myocardial hypoxemia.\r"

Accordingly, 10 conscious dogs instrumented with pulsed Doppler thickening probes underwent a 15 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 7 days of reperfusion. Regional systolic function was assessed as net systolic thickening fraction. Left ventricular regional diastolic properties were estimated from two variables: the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and the late diastolic thinning fraction. Both indexes of diastolic function remained severely impaired after restoration of flow. In general, the recovery of the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and of the late diastolic thinning fraction paralleled the recovery of systolic thickening, but the impairment of the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning was more marked than that of the late diastolic thinning fraction. At 4 h of reperfusion, the values for the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and the late diastolic thinning fraction (expressed as percent of baseline) were 57 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline) and 79 +/- 7% (p less than 0.05), respectively, whereas systolic thickening fraction averaged 52 +/- 10% (p less than 0.001). At 24 h, the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and the late diastolic thinning fraction were no longer significantly different from baseline, whereas systolic thickening fraction remained decreased at 82 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) and returned to control values by 48 h. This study demonstrates the presence of profound, prolonged abnormalities of regional diastolic wall thinning after a brief episode of ischemia in the conscious state and expands the concept of myocardial stunning from the traditional notion of impaired systolic performance to that of a global derangement in mechanical function that involves both systolic and diastolic properties.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a transient (15 min) period of regional ischemia on coronary flow reserve in the postischemic myocardium was studied in 24 open chest dogs. Coronary flow was measured with electromagnetic flow probes, and flow reserve was determined during reactive hyperemia after 30 s coronary occlusions and during intracoronary infusions of adenosine. Measures of flow reserve after 15 min of ischemia were made after coronary flow returned to basal levels and flow reserve was then monitored for 1 h. All measures of coronary flow reserve were significantly reduced after transient ischemia: peak flows during reactive hyperemia and intracoronary adenosine infusions decreased by 20 and 24%, respectively, the peak/basal flow ratio by 16% and the repayment/debt ratio by 54%; minimal coronary vascular resistance during reactive hyperemia and intracoronary adenosine increased by 29 and 33%, respectively. Abnormal flow reserve was present for at least 1 h. No changes in flow reserve were detected in control animals over the same time period. Thus, a transient period of myocardial ischemia significantly decreases coronary flow reserve for a prolonged period of time. This \"vascular stunning\" must be considered when flow reserve is used to assess the functional significance of a coronary stenosis and could be the cause of variable exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris.\r"

Regional perfusion was altered by a critical coronary stenosis (around the left anterior descending coronary artery) or by administering intracoronary adenosine (into the left circumflex coronary artery), or both. Changes in regional blood flow between control and interventions were compared with the changes in the contrast appearance variables. In addition, the ability of intracyclic variability of gray level intensity to predict myocardial perfusion was assessed. In the determination of absolute myocardial perfusion, background-subtracted peak gray level intensity and the maximal slope of the appearance curve demonstrated a fair correlation (r = 0.67 and 0.51, respectively, p less than 0.0001). However, time to peak contrast appearance did not correlate (r = 0.14, p = 0.31). Intracyclic variability of gray level intensity at control (before contrast injection) and after contrast injection also did not correlate with perfusion (r = 0.18 and 0.06, respectively). In the evaluation of relative changes in myocardial blood flow, the percent change in the maximal slope of the appearance curve correlated with the percent change in blood flow (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). Seven of the eight regions with greater than 3.5-fold increase in blood flow were identified by an increase in maximal slope of greater than 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 14 anesthetized open chest dogs with large contoured defibrillation electrodes, the effect on defibrillation efficacy of varying the duration of the two phases of biphasic waveforms was studied. All combinations of 0, 1, 3.5, 6 and 8.5 ms duration were used for both the first and the second phase except for the meaningless case in which both durations were 0 ms. The 3.5-2 waveform (3.5 ms first phase and 2 ms second phase) was also tested. All the hearts were defibrillated with less than or equal to 5 joules using any of the 25 waveforms. However, biphasic waveforms with the second phase shorter than or equal to the first had significantly lower defibrillation thresholds than did those with the second phase longer than the first or than did monophasic waveforms of approximately the same total duration. A plot of defibrillation threshold current strength versus second phase duration for all biphasic waveforms with a 3.5 ms first phase did not produce a hyperbolic strength-duration curve as seen with monophasic waveforms. To verify these findings, defibrillation dose-response curves were obtained for the 3.5-2, 6-6 and 3.5-8.5 biphasic waveforms in another six dogs. The 50 and 80% successful voltage doses of the 3.5-8.5 waveforms were significantly higher than those of the other two waveforms, which were not different from one another.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of the effects of bundle branch block on ventriculoatrial (VA) intervals during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia have focused on the timing of the atrial electrograms. However, left bundle branch block importantly affects the timing of initial ventricular activation, and this effect would also be expected to affect VA intervals during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. Presented here are three patients with a single right-sided accessory atrioventricular pathway exhibiting left bundle branch block during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. Each had shortening of the VA interval by 10 to 30 ms during left bundle branch block beats. This shortening was accompanied by a nearly equal increase in the HV interval, with the His bundle to atrial interval remaining constant. It is concluded that the timing of ventricular as well as atrial electrograms impacts on the VA intervals with left bundle branch block beats during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. With left bundle branch block, delay in initial left septal activation results in later onset of the QRS complex and, with right ventricular activation occurring normally, shortening of the VA interval occurs in patients with a right-sided pathway.\r"

Given left atrial and ventricular compliance, initial pressures and mitral valve impedance, the model predicts the time course of mitral flow and atrial and ventricular pressure. The predictions of this mathematic formulation have been tested in an in vitro analog of the left heart in which mitral valve area and atrial and ventricular compliance can be accurately controlled. For the situation of constant chamber compliance, transmitral gradient is predicted to decay as a parabolic curve, and this has been confirmed in the in vitro model with r greater than 0.99 in all cases for a range of orifice area from 0.3 to 3.0 cm2, initial pressure gradient from 2.4 to 14.2 mm Hg and net chamber compliance from 16 to 29 cc/mm Hg. This mathematic formulation of transmitral flow should help to unify the Doppler echocardiographic and catheterization assessment of mitral stenosis and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\r"

Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and cage valves, 3 types of disc and cage valves, 7 types of tilting disc valves, 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and disc and cage valves had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1.5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doppler color flow map images were analyzed using a Sony RGB video-digitizing computer, providing numerical velocity assignments for the blue, red and green (variance) pixel components to allow the flow maps to be constructed into digital velocity maps and pseudo three-dimensional velocity maps. The maximal velocity stream extended distal to the tunnel (2 to 19 mm), and the length of this extension correlated well with the pressure gradient measured across the tunnel (r = 0.89), with a rapidly decelerating and turbulent spray area seen immediately distal to the valve. Pressure gradient calculated from the maximal velocity derived from the color flow map, which could only be estimated from the velocity maps for the 1.5 cm2 tunnel, correlated well with the gradient measured across the tunnel (18.0 +/- 14.1 versus 19.2 +/- 14.5 mm Hg, respectively, r = 0.98). Acceleration was seen proximal to both tunnels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a subgroup of 52 elderly patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom certain clinical and morphologic features differed importantly from those of many other patients with this disease. Ages ranged from 60 to 84 years (mean 69) and 45 [87%] were women. Echocardiographic examination showed a relatively small heart, having only modest ventricular septal hypertrophy associated with marked distortion of left ventricular outflow tract morphology. By virtue of selection, left ventricular outflow tract size at end-diastole was substantially reduced, and anterior displacement of the mitral valve within the left ventricular cavity was particularly marked. Sizable deposits of calcium in the region of the mitral anulus, posterior to the mitral valve, appeared to contribute to the outflow tract narrowing. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was severe (with apposition of the mitral valve and ventricular septum) in 32 patients and more moderate in 20. The mechanism by which systolic contact between the mitral valve and septum occurred in most patients appeared to differ from that observed more typically in many other patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; in most elderly study patients, anterior excursion of the mitral valve leaflets was relatively restricted, and systolic apposition between the mitral valve and septum resulted from a combination of anterior motion of the mitral valve and posterior excursion of the septum. The vast majority (50 of 52) of the patients remained asymptomatic (or only mildly symptomatic) for most of their lives and often did not develop severe and intractable symptoms until the 6th or 7th decade (ages 56 to 81 years; mean 66). Of the 49 patients with at least 1 year follow-up study, only 12 had improvement with pharmacologic therapy; however, 14 of the 18 patients who underwent ventricular septal myotomy-myectomy or mitral valve replacement obtained symptomatic benefit from operation. In conclusion, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in many elderly (and predominantly female) patients may assume a distinctive morphologic appearance and a progressive clinical course. This subgroup of patients appears to constitute an important segment of the disease spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of cardiac disease in the elderly that previously has not been precisely defined nor fully appreciated.\r"

None of the patients showed clinical evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy. All but two patients had normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Peak filling rate was significantly lower and time to peak filling rate was significantly greater in patients than in normal subjects (2.60 +/- 0.52 versus 3.10 +/- 0.44 EDV/s, p less than 0.001, and 215 +/- 53 versus 147 +/- 18 ms, p less than 0.001, respectively). The mean left ventricular filling volume during rapid diastolic filling and atrial systole in patients was 54.5 +/- 19.5% and 44.2 +/- 21.6% of the stroke volume, respectively, compared with 83.8 +/- 6.6% (p less than 0.001) and 20.0 +/- 6.0% (p less than 0.001), respectively, in normal subjects. Although 10 of the 14 patients without clinical evidence of overt heart disease had normal ventricular wall thickness as well as normal ejection fraction, 8 of the 10 showed abnormal diastolic filling. In patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, indexes of diastolic filling were significantly related to ventricular wall thickness alone. The incidence and magnitude of abnormalities in time to peak filling rate and contribution of rapid filling as well as atrial systole to ventricular filling increased with age and duration of illness. Thus, abnormal diastolic filling can be seen even in the early stage of familial amyloid polyneuropathy and may be related to myocardial amyloid deposition as well as to fibrosis. Careful consideration should be given to age and duration of illness when diastolic filling is assessed in this disorder.\r"

One episode of thrombotic obstruction of a mitral valve, in a patient receiving no anticoagulant therapy, resulted in an occurrence rate of such obstruction of 0.22%/patient-year. Valve replacement with the St. Jude valve produced excellent clinical results, but long-term anticoagulation with warfarin was required to minimize thromboembolic complications.

With the addition of Doppler ultrasound to the routine follow-up assessment of these patients an unexpectedly high occurrence of aortic regurgitation was found in the postoperative patients. Because aortic regurgitation has been reported to rarely accompany this condition, 67 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were studied clinically and with Doppler echocardiography for the presence and severity of aortic regurgitation. Severity of the regurgitation was quantitated by pulsed or color Doppler echocardiography according to the length and width of the regurgitant jet in at least two views. In 37 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who did not undergo surgery, aortic regurgitation was detected in only 1 (3%) by Doppler ultrasound and in none clinically. In 52 patients who did undergo surgery and were studied a mean of 7.8 years postoperatively, aortic regurgitation of trivial to moderate degree was common, being detected in 28 (54%) by Doppler ultrasound and in 6 (12%) clinically. In a subgroup of 22 patients who were studied preoperatively and again early postoperatively (mean 6 weeks), new aortic regurgitation was found in 8 (36%) and was graded as trivial in all. Aortic regurgitation is a common complication related to ventriculomyectomy and ventriculomyotomy in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Although initially trivial, the regurgitation may progress in severity over time. The regurgitation has been well tolerated in all patients studied to date.\r"

  ".W": "This is the first systematic study of the effects of ventricular premature beats on sympathetic nerve activity in humans. Microneurographic techniques were used to record efferent sympathetic activity from the peroneal nerve, and an intracardiac electrode catheter was used to introduce ventricular premature beats after every 6 to 10 sinus heartbeats. Studies were performed in eight patients, aged 22 to 74 years (mean 57), undergoing cardiac electrophysiologic studies. Three patients did not have apparent heart disease and five had coronary artery disease. During sinus rhythm, 19 to 93% (mean 42%) of heartbeats were followed by a pulse-synchronous burst of sympathetic activity. Provoked ventricular premature beats had obvious effects on this activity. Premature beats with coupling intervals less than 80% of sinus cycle length were consistently followed by a burst of sympathetic activity, and this activity was greater in amplitude, duration and area (all p less than 0.05) than were burst of such activity during sinus rhythm. The magnitude of this burst of activity increased as the coupling interval of the ventricular premature beat decreased (p less than 0.0001). In contrast, postextrasystolic beats were followed by nearly complete neural silence. These effects were seen in all patients regardless of baseline burst incidence and the presence or absence of heart disease. Total nerve activity per 10 heartbeats was 6,520 +/- 770 U during ventricular extrastimulation and 5,720 +/- 440 U during normal sinus rhythm (difference not significant). It is concluded that single ventricular premature beats provoke fluxes of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in humans, comprising surges of sympathetic activity larger than those occurring during sinus rhythm, followed by neural silence.\r"

  ".W": "To estimate the accuracy of cardiac output measured by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography from the suprasternal notch and the utility of this method for evaluating left ventricular function during dynamic exercise, simultaneous thermodilution and Doppler cardiac output were measured in 34 patients with coronary artery disease during multistage ergometer exercise in the supine position. Cardiac output was measured at rest and during each stage of exercise. Twenty-five of the 34 patients whose thermodilution curves were adequate for analysis were studied during exercise. The correlation coefficient for the two methods was 0.85 at rest and 0.84 during exercise. Differences between the two methods were not significant at rest but were significant during exercise, with the thermodilution method giving the higher values. Underestimation by the Doppler method is probably due to technical problems and changes in aortic diameter during exercise. The 25 patients were classified into two groups according to pulmonary artery wedge pressure at peak exercise. There were 11 patients in Group 1 pressure (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg at peak exercise) and 14 in Group 2 pressure (less than 20 mm Hg at peak exercise). There were significant differences in the change in cardiac index and in peak aortic velocity from rest to peak exercise between the two groups. A significant linear correlation between the percent change in peak aortic velocity and in pulmonary artery wedge pressure from rest to peak exercise was observed (r = -0.66, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Holosystolic regurgitant color jets were classified as type I or type II. The data were compared with results obtained with precordial techniques, i.e., continuous wave and Doppler color flow echocardiographic imaging (Groups 1 to 4) and left ventricular angiography or surgery (Groups 2 and 4). In Group 1, transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging revealed no mitral regurgitant flow in 7 of the 11 patients and a type I jet in 4 patients that was detected in only 1 patient by precordial techniques. In Group 2, angiography showed no mitral regurgitation in 20 patients and documented mitral regurgitation in 5. Transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging detected in 4 of the 20 patients a type I jet that was not visualized with precordial techniques in 2 patients. Type II jets were detected by the transesophageal technique in all five patients with proven mitral regurgitation and were also visualized with precordial echocardiography. All patients in Group 3 showed two identical type I jets that were not detected with precordial echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of eating disorders and eating disorder-related symptoms in particular subgroups for targeting intervention and prevention programs. Although between 7.5% and 46% of subgroup populations reported the presence of individual eating disorder-related symptoms, the prevalence of active eating disorders for the group as a whole at the time of the survey was 2.1%, with the prevalence of disorders at any time during life 4.8%, using DSM-III diagnosis. The Eating Disorders Inventory scores for the group as a whole were comparable with norms reported by other researchers in the literature. Primary Care Clinic attenders and dance majors reported the highest rates of symptoms and disorders, while athletes reported the lowest rates.\r"

Twenty-four patients hospitalized for treatment of anorexia nervosa were compared with 10 normal controls. Patients ate a self-selected diet and maintained their admission weight to within 1.0 kg during this period (19 +/- 3 days). Food chosen by each subject was weighed before and after meals, and intake was determined to be the difference. Intakes of food energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate were calculated. Patients were closely monitored to ensure that no disposal of food occurred. Patients with anorexia nervosa had a mean daily energy intake of 1,017 +/- 54 kcal (mean +/- SEM), significantly lower than the mean energy intake for controls (1,651 +/- 108 kcal). Similarly, mean intakes of macronutrients (41 +/- 4 gm protein, 34 +/- 2 gm fat, and 136 +/- 9 gm carbohydrate) were significantly lower for patients than for controls (68.5 +/- gm protein, 65 +/- 6 gm fat, and 204 +/- 13 gm carbohydrate). However, when protein, fat, and carbohydrate were assessed as a percent of total calories, there were no significant differences between patients and controls. There were also no significant differences in calories consumed per kilogram body weight. Underweight patients with anorexia nervosa who maintain their weight on an unrestricted hospital diet have energy intake per kilogram body weight and dietary macronutrient content indistinguishable from those of normal women.\r"

Forty-nine female ballet dancers, mean age 18.7 years, completed food frequency and injury questionnaires. Subjects were placed in one of two groups: those with an intake less than 70% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for key nutrients and those with an intake greater than 70% of the RDA for key nutrients. Sixty-nine percent of the dancers had intakes less than 70% of the RDA and were randomly assigned to either a vitamin/mineral supplement or to placebo for 6 months. The remaining dancers with diets adequate (greater than 70% RDA) in key nutrients received no treatment. All groups were questioned monthly about the incidence, severity, and nature of ballet injuries. Information regarding menses and height and weight was obtained. There were no significant differences in the severity or type of injuries among the dancers in the supplement, placebo, or no treatment groups. Dancers with abnormal menses had more bone injuries (mean = 15.00) than normally menstruating dancers (mean = 4.97) (p less than .05). Dancers with a Body Mass Index less than 19.0 spent more days with a low-grade injury (mean = 24.05) than dancers with a greater BMI (mean = 11.63) (p less than .05). There appears to be a relationship between dance injuries and both BMI and menstrual function.\r"

The children had energy intakes below or in the lower range of the reference values given in the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Intakes of vitamins and minerals were acceptable when supplements were taken into account. Despite low physical activity, all pupils were thin. The interviews with the parents revealed early and serious feeding problems that arose at weaning. At the same time, growth retardation was registered for a majority of the pupils. All pupils were described as strikingly thin while growing up. We conclude that the early feeding problems were so pronounced that malnutrition may be considered a contributing factor to the growth retardation.\r"

Staff members at practice settings, with increased responsibilities on the job, stipulate limitations on the numbers of students and request that they be better prepared. Dietetic educators are faced with maintaining the quality of supervised practice, particularly for new students, in spite of reduced availability of practice settings and time limitations of staff preceptors. An option is the multiple assignment--a technique in which students function as a team. Three students, each with a set of specialized objectives, cooperate in the care of one patient: One is the doer, one is the resource person, and one is the evaluator. This methodology was adapted to dietetics, and a pilot project was conducted in a hospital setting. Three student teams (nine students), three clinical preceptors, and one faculty member participated. Students achieved at high levels and demonstrated great satisfaction in their supervised practice. For staff preceptors, the team approach reduced student-related time involvement by one-half and promoted the quality of student performance. Guidelines for further application of the model are given.\r"

The program was planned in accordance with some specific training guidelines that were provided by the Peace Corps. The trainees included nine women ranging in age from 22 to 61 years with diverse backgrounds; however, all had a BA/BS in a health-related discipline. Training curriculum included fundamental nutrition and health-related areas: basic nutrition, foods, clinical nutrition, maternal and child health, communicable diseases and sanitation, health strategies, and community development. Fifty percent of the curriculum was devoted to \"hands-on\" practical and clinical activities. Maternal and child health was emphasized in the training curriculum as this is an area of concern in all developing countries. The trainees were evaluated by weekly quizzes as well as completion of a special project involving applications of all their newly acquired skills. Implications of the training program are discussed.\r"

In areas of the U.S. with large SE Asian populations, many foods specific to those people are readily available. Approximately 5% of the total U.S. population has medical problems that lead to kidney disease. Many SE Asian refugees have prior medical problems, such as hepatitis B, that may make them at significantly higher risk for kidney disease. A modified renal exchange list (excluding milk, carbohydrate supplement, and fat group) was developed. This list, made up of foods readily available and commonly eaten by the largest group of SE Asian immigrants, the Vietnamese, categorizes foods by protein, potassium, and caloric content. A separate list, indicating the phosphorus content of these foods, is also included. Asian grocery stores were visited to identify foods available for purchase by SE Asians. The foods were identified, and nutrient composition was found in food composition tables. Because the Vietnamese diet is high in potassium and sodium, planning renal diets poses problems for both patients and dietitians. Close monitoring of diet can retard the progression of renal disease. An exchange list such as this assists both dietitians and renal patients in this important task.\r"

We investigated the yield of a home visit by a geriatric nurse specialist as part of an interdisciplinary assessment process.

Twenty-three percent of the problems could have resulted in death or significant morbidity. The most frequent problems related to psychobehavioral difficulties (23.1% of problems involving 38.3% of patients), safety (21.6% of problems involving 35.7% of patients), and caregiver related problems (20.4% of problems involving 33.8% of patients).

The areas studied were functional ability, relief of the principal symptom, education about the principal problem, and development of coping skills. Of 94 patients studied, 58 patients were discharged to the community (52 to carers, 6 to live alone) and 36 to institutions. In the former group, the health team had a consistently higher perception of benefit than the clients (P less than .001). Factors positively predicting health team perception of benefit were a higher carer happiness, improvement in patient independence, and internalization of the patient's locus of control. A negative predictor was an increase in patients' responsibilities. Client perception of benefit was positively predicted by fewer problems with companionship and communication with others. The health team's perception rated the adequacy of patient education and development of coping skills more highly than did the clients. In the patients discharged to the community, their perception of benefit at 1 week was a good predictor of survival in the community to 6 weeks. The possible reasons for these differences in perception of benefit and their implications are discussed.\r"

Results indicated that the large majority of patients had affective syndromes; dementia was the second most common diagnosis. Length of stay correlated with severity of depressive illness, while a diagnosis of dementia was associated with a shorter hospitalization. Outcome measures showed favorable response to treatment in three-fourths of this population of elderly psychiatric patients. These data suggest that the general hospital acute inpatient setting is well suited to care for the combined medical and mental illnesses of elderly psychiatric patients.\r"

Of these variables only arm muscle area, triceps skinfold thickness, and activity in recreation were independent predictors of hip fracture incidence using the Cox proportional hazards model. After adjustment, the estimated relative risk of hip fracture was approximately two for an increment of each anthropometric indicator (adjusted for the other) equivalent to comparing those at the 25th percentile to those at the 75th percentile (maximum width of 95% confidence intervals, 1.2-2.9). Risk of hip fracture was approximately two-fold for persons who reported little recreational exercise compared to persons who reported much recreational exercise (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2). Our findings are the first evidence from a prospective study that anthropometric indicators besides body mass index may have an independent relationship to risk of hip fracture.\r"

TA3 cells contained 1.6 x 10(5) I-A sites/cell, 22 to 35% of which were intracellular. This intracellular pool was cycloheximide resistant. PEC contained 1.8 x 10(5) I-A sites/cell, 25 to 40% of which were intracellular. Upon adherence, however, the intracellular pool of I-A in PEC dropped to 2 to 11% of the total cellular I-A. Ag processing by TA3 cells was unaffected 3 h after abrogation of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, suggesting that newly synthesized I-A is not necessary for Ag processing in TA3 cells (post-synthetic processing and transport of I-A to the plasma membrane were complete by 2 h in TA3 cells with or without cycloheximide, as assessed by sequential immunoprecipitation of surface and intracellular I-A). In adherent PEC, however, cycloheximide markedly inhibited Ag processing, suggesting depletion of factors necessary for Ag processing. Ag processing may involve binding of processed Ag peptides to intracellular Ia derived to varying degrees from both endocytosis and new biosynthesis. To explore the possibility of I-A recycling, I-A endocytosis was demonstrated using mAb and monovalent Fab probes; internalization occurred within 5 min and peaked by 10 to 15 min with 15 to 35% of bound antibody in an intracellular compartment, resistant to an acid wash. Subcellular density gradient fractionation demonstrated that I-A and transferrin were processed exclusively in an endosomal fraction of relatively light density, whereas ligands of the mannose receptor were processed in light endosomes and in a distinct, denser population of endosomes, and accumulated in lysosomes. Thus, I-A appears to be internalized into a specific population of endosomes that may play a central role in Ag processing.\r"

Dimers (P2), trimers (P3), tetramers (P4), and higher Mr polymers (Pn) of the 46,000-Da subunit were separated by gel filtration or by cation exchange chromatography of purified properdin. The specific activity of each form was measured in two assays. The native properdin activity of P4 was 10 times that of P2 (on a molar basis) with the order: P4 greater than P3 greater than P2 greater than Pn. During C activation P4 was found to be consumed first, P3 second, and P2 last, consistent with their measured specific activities. Assays for activated properdin showed that only Pn caused fluid phase C consumption when incubated in serum at normal concentrations. Pn accumulated during long term storage of purified P and freezing rapidly converted the smaller oligomers to Pn. The isolated oligomers were extremely stable, but did redistribute after denaturation-renaturation cycles by using low pH or guanidine. Renaturation after exposure of any species to denaturing conditions yielded mixtures of 20:54:26 (P4:P3:P2). This distribution was almost identical to that found in fresh normal human serum or plasma, suggesting that a distinct distribution of oligomers exists in blood that provides the C system with an apparently advantageous range of specific activities.\r"

Previous studies have shown that after exposure to CoFBb and serum, PNH III E bind relatively large amounts of the trimolecular C complex, C5b67, whereas normal and PNH II E bind virtually none. In the studies reported herein, we have observed that when normal and PNH III E are incubated with isolated C5, C6, and 125I-C7 in the presence CoFBb, the normal E bind more C5b-7 than the PNH cells. When C7-deficient serum is included in the reaction mixture, however, the PNH E are once again observed to bind much greater amounts of C5b-7. These observations suggest that plasma and membrane factors act in concert to restrict the assembly of the trimolecular C5b-7 complex on human E. PNH III E appear to be deficient in the membrane component of this inhibitory system.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied Ag-induced membrane potential changes of rat basophilic leukemia cells by using the potential-sensitive dye, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)trimethineoxonol. A rapid membrane depolarization is triggered by a multivalent Ag, and it has a bell-shaped dose dependence that parallels the degranulation response but not the extent of cross-linking of the IgE-receptor complexes. As the temperature is reduced from 37 degrees C, this depolarization response slows and decreases in magnitude until complete inhibition is observed at 15 degrees C, similar to the temperature dependence previously observed for the Ag-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and for degranulation. The results imply that a highly temperature-dependent step subsequent to Ag binding and cross-linking is necessary for the depolarization response. A partial return to the resting potential is seen to follow the depolarization response to Ag. This repolarization process is inhibited by quinidine.HCl and Ba2+ in parallel with an inhibition of the degranulation response. Repolarization is not affected by 4-aminopyridine or by the absence of K+ in the external buffer. These data suggest that the repolarization is caused by a previously uncharacterized K+ channel.\r"

  ".U": "89080257\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we observed that resistance of murine SV40-transformed fibroblast cell lines to cytolysis by activated macrophages was frequently associated with cellular expression of the gp70 of an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV). The work described here was initiated to test directly for a causative relationship between MuLV expression and resistance to lysis by macrophages. Northern blot analysis revealed that macrophage-resistant cells contain full length retroviral RNA. A panel of mAb which distinguish among host-range classes of MuLV detected only a non-recombinant ecotropic gp70 in these cells. The ecotropic MuLV from two independently derived macrophage resistant cells were isolated by limiting dilution cloning on Mus dunii fibroblasts. These viruses were then used to infect macrophage-sensitive cell lines and the resultant MuLV-positive cells tested for sensitivity to macrophage cytolysis. The MuLV-infected lines remained highly sensitive to macrophage lysis despite their high levels of cell surface gp70 and release of infectious MuLV. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that MuLV or a product thereof is necessary for development of macrophage resistance in transformed cells, expression of MuLV per se is not sufficient to create the resistant phenotype.\r"

  ".U": "89080258\r", 
  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that anterior chamber (AC) injection of HSV-1 before or simultaneous with topical corneal HSV-1 infection resulted in cellular immune tolerance of HSV-1 Ag and a reduced frequency of corneal stromal lesions. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the HSV-1 cell-surface glycoproteins gC and gB in the induction of tolerance, and the resulting reduced susceptibility to HSV-1 corneal stromal disease. These studies utilized mutant strains of HSV-1 with deletion or point mutations in the gene coding for gC or gB. Groups of mice received topical corneal infections with wild-type HSV-1, followed by AC injection of the same eye with wild-type HSV-1 or a mutant strain. Varying the antigenic composition of the virus injected into the AC resulted in three distinct patterns of immune responsiveness. In agreement with our previous findings, AC injection of wild-type HSV-1 induced a state of HSV-1 specific tolerance that extended to both the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CTL responses. A mutant strain lacking gC (gC-) induced partial tolerance characterized by undetectable CTL activity but a normal DTH response. A mutant strain lacking gB (gB-) caused partial suppression of the CTL response and no reduction of the DTH response. Thus, whereas gB may be involved in CTL tolerance induction in this model, gC clearly is not involved. In contrast, both gC and gB must be present in the AC to induce detectable DTH tolerance. The latter interpretation was strengthened by the observation that AC injection of a mixture of gC- (expressing normal gB) and gB- (expressing normal gC) effectively suppressed the DTH response to wild-type HSV-1. A panel of mar mutants with individual point mutations affecting gC and gB was used to identify the epitopes responsible for induction of DTH tolerance. Two of the gC mutants failed to induce DTH tolerance to wild-type HSV-1 when injected into the AC, suggesting that the sites on the gC molecule that are altered by these mutations are important for the induction of DTH tolerance. Similarly, one of the mar mutants for gB uniformly failed to suppress the DTH response, while another had a variable effect. The unique pattern of cellular immune reactivity exhibited by the mice receiving simultaneous topical corneal infection with wild-type HSV-1 and AC injection of gC- (no CTL but normal DTH) was associated with significantly reduced susceptibility to HSV-1 corneal stromal lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

For example, the H-2b D region contains a single \"D/L\" gene, H-2Db, whereas the d-haplotype encodes two, H-2Dd and Ld. Using D/L specific oligonucleotide probes, we have found that, as with H-2d, the q- and v-haplotypes contain two D/L genes, whereas the other haplotype examined have one. Hybridization analysis using cloned probes that map between H-2Dd and Ld revealed similar structures in each of the three haplotypes (d, q, and v) which have \"duplicated\" D regions. Two approaches were used to examine allelic relationships among the D/L genes. First, the 5' region of the H-2Db gene was sequenced, and found to be more similar to H-2Ld than to H-2Dd. Second, oligonucleotide probes that distinguish H-2Ld from H-2Dd revealed H-2Ld-related genes in several haplotypes, including the duplicated haplotypes H-2q and H-2v. Analogous probes specific for H-2Dd, however, did not detect similar sequences in the other haplotypes. We interpret these results to mean that the three duplicated D regions arose from a common duplication event, and share the five gene structure of the D region cluster defined in H-2d. However, subsequent events have generated sequence divergence at the D-locus.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of colorectal carcinomas has been examined immunohistologically with mAb specific for allodeterminants of HLA-A or HLA-B, and with mAb reactive with HLA-A,B,C framework determinants or beta 2-microglobulin. Out of 85 carcinomas, 5 cases were completely negative for all class I Ag in the tumor cell population. Fifteen cases exhibited a differential expression of HLA-A and HLA-B products in all tumor cells or in a subset. Such tumor cells showed strong staining with monomorphic HLA antibodies but failed to stain with certain allospecific mAb. Negativity of tumor cells was scored only when normal stromal cells within the tumor mass were clearly labeled, indicating expression of the particular allodeterminant(s) in the given tissue. Four carcinomas showed a selective loss of HLA-A2 or a non-A2 HLA-A allospecificity in all tumor cells or a major subset, whereas HLA-B Ag were expressed. Seven cases showed a selective loss of the HLA-Bw6 superspecificity in the tumor cell population; HLA-Bw4 and HLA-A Ag were present. Three cases exhibited a combined loss of HLA-A2 and HLA-Bw6 Ag, with non-A2 HLA-A and HLA-Bw4 Ag being expressed. A further case was HLA-Bw6/Bw4 negative in a major tumor cell subset and HLA-A negative in the complementary minor subset. The results show that a considerable proportion of colorectal carcinomas is heterogeneous with regard to HLA-A and HLA-B expression. The reasons for the appearance of tumor subsets with complete loss of class I Ag or selective loss of only HLA-A or HLA-B Ag are not clear, but it is conceivable that some of them arose because they have escaped immunoselection.\r"

  ".W": "The careful choice of a combination of laser parameters such as wavelength, pulse duration, and dose has provided a means for confining laser energy to specific targets within tissue such as oxyhemoglobin within the cutaneous microvasculature. In the process of achieving such vascular selectivity, certain ultrastructural changes in red blood cell (RBC) cytoplasm have been observed, such as the generation of intracytoplasmic electron-lucent spherical structures. These structures, ranging in size from 80 to 1000A, were seen in RBCs exposed to laser doses at and above threshold, and appeared to represent a morphologically novel form of highly-specific tissue injury. This in vitro study using RBC in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was undertaken to better understand the mechanism(s) that could have been responsible for these unique morphologic changes. We conclude that the intracytoplasmic electron-lucent spherical structures seen within RBCs were heat-fixed molds formed around vaporized water bubbles and were not produced by the release of oxygen from the oxyhemoglobin moiety during 577-nm laser irradiation.\r"

Both the diffusion coefficient and the partition coefficient in the stratum corneum can be determined by the amounts of drug in the stratum corneum at two time intervals under transient conditions after transdermal drug application. The amount of drug entering the stratum corneum is determined by 20 strippings with an adhesive tape. The steady-state rate of penetration was then calculated for the thickness of the stratum corneum and the concentration of the donor solution. The steady-state rates of penetration of ascorbic acid and estradiol across hairless mouse skin were evaluated from this in vivo approach and compared with those obtained from in vitro penetration experiment using excised hairless mouse skin. The data confirmed that the proposed in vivo method can predict the steady-state rate of penetration of these drugs across the stratum corneum in normal skin.\r"

  ".U": "89080298\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study, we demonstrate that human stratum corneum contains covalently bound lipids accounting for 1.4% of the dry weight of the tissue. The major component (53.3% of the total by weight) is a ceramide (CER-A) consisting of 30 through 34-carbon omega-hydroxyacids amide-linked to sphingosine. The other bound lipids in human stratum corneum include fatty acids (12.7%), omega-hydroxy acids (9.4%), and a second, more polar, omega-hydroxyacid-containing ceramide (CER-B, 24.8%). The predominant omega-hydroxyacids in both ceramides, as well as the free hydroxyacid fraction, are the 30-carbon saturated and 32- and 34-carbon monoenoic species. The bound fatty acids consist largely of 14 through 22-carbon saturated species, but significant proportions of monoenoic species and linoleic acid are also present. Psoriatic scale contains a similar total concentration of the same covalently bound lipids, but the proportions of the individual bound lipids are different from those found in normal stratum corneum. It is suggested that the principal function of the covalently bound lipids in human stratum corneum is the formation of a lipid envelope on the outer surface of the keratinized cells.\r"

We wondered if a series of events similar to this might occur in the normal murine epidermis without irradiation. In this study, we could identify exactly the same phases of the ELC mitotic cycle in normal mouse ear skin.\r"

  ".W": "Using a method that allowed the reconstruction of simplified living human skin in vitro, we investigated the effects of collagen texture and dermal fibroblasts on epidermal growth. Like in vivo skin, our in vitro model comprised two tissues: a dermal equivalent and an overlying epidermis. It permitted measurement of epidermal growth and therefore evaluation of the effect of the dermal equivalent on this growth. Epidermal growth was enhanced when the collagen matrix had previously been reorganized by fibroblasts, and was greatest when living fibroblasts persisted in this matrix. On cell-free collagen gel and on collagen matrices containing dead fibroblasts, epidermal growth increased when the medium was conditioned by fibroblasts grown in monolayers. We conclude that the function of the fibroblasts is not only to synthesize and degrade the extracellular matrix, but also to regulate epidermalization; on the one hand by remodeling the collagen fibers, and on the other by secreting diffusible factors that promote epidermal growth. These results underline the importance of fibroblasts in dermo-epidermal interactions, and show that the skin equivalent culture model provides a way to quantitatively study these interactions.\r"

In unstripped normal skin and in the clinically uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients some patchy staining limited to the basal layer was seen. The clear distinction between normal and hyperproliferative skin in keratin expression as detected by Ks8.12 indicates that this antibody may serve as a marker for epidermal proliferation in psoriasis.\r"

Purity of the culture was confirmed by light and electron microscopy and by the use of a monoclonal antibody NKI-beteb, which is specific for a vesicular membrane antigen present on melanocytes. Melanocytes were tested for their affinity to several microcarriers. They attached to cytodex 1 and 3 and dorma cell, but they did not attach to glass and gelatin beads. The best results were obtained with cytodex 3. After an almost immediate and total attachment of melanocytes a fourfold to fivefold increase in cell number was achieved on this microcarrier within 3 weeks. With the results obtained, it seems that the collagen-coated cytodex 3 microcarrier surface supports the growth of melanocytes. Preliminary results obtained with a microcarrier cell culture fermenter clearly indicate that the large-scale cultivation of normal human melanocytes in such an automated system is possible.\r"

We have investigated the nature of this association. Aliquots of minced, homogenized dermis, obtained following ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) separation of whole adult human skin, were extracted with different reagents, and the presence or absence of TAP in the pellet and in the supernatant following centrifugation was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-SAP antibodies. TAP was extractable from dermis using reagents which disrupt non-covalent bonds, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and guanidine hydrochloride. TAP was not extracted by high molarity salt solutions, non-ionic detergents, or the reducing agents dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. EDTA solution was similarly unsuccessful at eluting TAP from the dermal preparation, indicating that the association of TAP with elastic fiber microfibrils is not simply the result of Ca++-dependent binding. Collagenase solubilized some TAP, but this does not prove covalent linkage to elastic tissue of part of the TAP, because the apparent Mr of TAP extracted was identical to that of normal SAP subunits. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that a few subunits in each multimeric TAP molecule are covalently attached to the microfibrils. However, our findings that denaturing agents alone extracted most of the TAP from normal human dermis strongly suggest that the great majority of the dermal TAP is non-covalently bound to elastic fiber microfibrils. Thus TAP is not an integral constitutent of elastic fiber microfibrils.\r"

  ".W": "Histologic changes induced in SENCAR skin following a single treatment with chrysarobin (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-9-anthrone) exhibited differences in time course from that observed with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Although not significantly different, maximum elevations in epidermal thickness, total number of nucleated epidermal cells, and dark basal keratinocytes (DCs) induced by 220 nmol chrysarobin occurred at 96 h after treatment, while those induced by 3.4 nmol TPA occurred at 48 h. Both compounds elicited comparable inflammatory responses. Twice-weekly applications of chrysarobin for 2.5 weeks induced a moderate hyperplasia, increase in total nucleated epidermal cells, and increased DCs at 48 and 96 h after the last treatment, with a higher value for these parameters occurring at 48 h. Interestingly, the magnitude of these changes was similar to that observed after a single application. In contrast, twice-weekly applications of TPA induced a dramatic, potentiated induction of epidermal hyperplasia and DCs. Once-weekly applications of chrysarobin led to a potentiated induction of both hyperplasia and DCs compared to the twice-weekly treatment regimen and also more effectively promoted epidermal papillomas in previously initiated SENCAR mice. Skin sections from mice treated with chrysarobin displayed overt signs of epidermal toxicity including altered basal cell morphology and a decreased number of basal cells per 125 micron of basement membrane. Hyperplasia induced by multiple but not single treatments with chrysarobin and TPA correlated quantitatively with their papilloma promoting activity. In addition, the data suggest that epidermal toxicity may play a role in tumor promotion by anthrones.\r"

The 800 X g pellet (nuclear fraction) and the 164,000 X g supernatant fraction (cytosol) of homogenates of the sebaceous glands were used for measurements of androgen binding characteristics, using dextran-coated charcoal and sucrose gradient methods. Scatchard plots showed high affinity binding for [3H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and [3H]methyltrienolone (R1881). Nuclei prepared from bald scalp contained greater total androgen binding capacity than nuclei of hairy scalp, although Kd values of type I binding were similar (0.68 vs 0.56 nM, respectively). On sucrose gradient, the binding protein from cytosol was found in the 7 to 8S density range. Androgen binding by cytosol of sebaceous glands of hairy scalp had Kd of 1.89 +/- .79 and 2.05 +/- .56 nM for DHT and R1881, respectively, and Bmax of 18.7 +/- 4.4 and 20.0 +/- 4.6 fmol/mg protein for DHT and R1881, respectively. Cytosol from sebaceous glands of bald scalp had Kd values approximately half those of hairy scalp, and Bmax values 50%-100% higher. The bound 3H labeled DHT and R1881 could be partially displaced by testosterone (40-50%), moxestrol (28-32%), promegestone (19-26%), and delta 4-androstenedione (6-12%), but not by dehydroepiandrosterone. These data demonstrate the presence of specific androgen binding protein in sebaceous glands, and that sebaceous glands of bald scalp have greater binding affinity and capacity for androgens than those in hairy scalp. This difference may explain the greater androgenic response in androgenic alopecia.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the worldwide emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci among clinical isolates it was of importance to examine a large number of strains to test the uniformity of the resistance mechanism. Among 160 clinical isolates of pneumococci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 0.005-16 micrograms/mL), susceptible strains showed a common pattern of five penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with high penicillin affinities (PBP 3 greater than 1A greater than or equal to 2A greater than 1B greater than 2B). PBPs 1A, 2A, and 2B (but not PBP 3) each showed distinct stepwise decreases in penicillin affinities parallel with increasing levels of antibiotic resistance. The number and molecular sizes of PBPs became variable in strains with MIC values greater than 1.0 microgram/mL; among 39 strains with a MIC of greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/mL, 11 distinct and stable PBP patterns could be identified. Using PBP profiles, serotypes, and antibiotic resistance patterns, as well as data on isolation dates and sites, we identified at least three groups of resistant strains that showed clear indication of clonal origin.\r"

CSF proteins were analyzed in the acute phase of infection and during convalescence by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by two types of staining or by immunoblotting. During the acute phase a massive influx of serum albumin into the CSF was accompanied by the appearance of other proteins of high and low molecular weight. In untreated animals and animals given ampicillin alone or together with indomethacin, the abnormal pattern persisted for up to 30 d. Combined treatment with ampicillin and dexamethasone or oxindanac, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, partially prevented the alterations in CSF protein patterns. Reversion to normal CSF protein patterns was fastest in these two groups.\r"
