Seven patients (6.4%) developed a characteristic persistent intraarticular reaction. This reaction was characterized by persistent synovial effusion with collagenous particulates and cellular inflammatory response. Synovial biopsies in all cases showed a similar chronic inflammatory process, characterized by fibrin, collagen, and phagocytic cells. The intraarticular white cells were predominantly lymphocytes. Removal of the allograft resulted in resolution of the reaction in all of the patients. Three of the seven patients showed HLA conversion. Gas chromatography demonstrated detectable levels of ethylene chlorohydrin, a toxic reaction product of ethylene oxide, within the allograft and synovium 14 months following implantation of one graft. These seven cases presented strongly suggest a nonspecific or immune mediated response that must be further delineated. The use of freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized allografts using standard techniques cannot be recommended for reconstruction of the ACL.\r"

The majority of the traumatic injuries (93%) were to the lower extremities, with one third of the total injuries occurring in the knee. Overuse injuries accounted for 35% of all injuries and occurred mainly during preseason training and at the end of each season. Conversely, the majority of traumatic injuries occurred during games, equally distributed between the first and second halves with a predominance toward the end of each half. The position of the player within the team did not influence injury rate. The referee considered 28% of the traumatic injuries to be caused by violation of existing rules. Thirty-four percent of the injuries were major, causing more than 1 month of absence from training and/or games. Eleven knee injuries required surgical intervention revealing seven ruptured ACLs, of which three were chronic. At followup, 9 to 18.5 months after injury, 4 of 12 players with major knee injuries had returned to play at the elite level. The others had either been transferred to lower divisions or were still in rehabilitation.\r"

To demonstrate the new method, an experimental knee testing system was used to measure ligament and graft forces with buckle transducers, as external loads were applied to five fresh knee specimens with a pneumatic load apparatus. ACL and collateral ligament force data were collected as anteriorly directed loads of 90 N (20 pounds) were applied at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of flexion in the normal intact knee and the same knee following ACL excision. A composite graft was prepared, consisting of distally based semitendinosus and gracilis autogenous tissue augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device. Femoral fixation was obtained using a fixation plug that was inserted through the lateral femoral condyle. With a 90 N anterior tibial load applied at 30 degrees of flexion and a single buckle transducer measuring the total composite graft force, the graft length was varied using the fixation plug until the force matched that seen by the intact ACL under the same loading condition. The graft was then clamped in the fixation plug and the anterior load sequence at the four flexion angles was applied to this reconstructed knee state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The normal appearance of the capsule, particularly the anterior superior, and the functions of the structures during passive motion were noted. There was a distinct capsular pattern with a Z formation which included the coracohumeral ligament and the superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. The middle and proximal capsular structures appeared to restrain external rotation. The coracohumeral ligament aided in restraint of external rotation at the lower range of abduction. The middle glenohumeral ligament was critical in restraining external rotation between 60 degrees and 90 degrees of abduction. It was readily identifiable except in a small percentage of individuals, who had a weak or absent ligament. The large capsular opening sometimes seen in shoulder repairs is due to an absent or attenuated middle glenohumeral ligament. Both the coracohumeral and middle glenohumeral ligaments were found to support the dependent arm.\r"

  ".W": "Arthroscopic evaluation of patients with an acute anterior shoulder dislocation was done to identify and classify the intraarticular lesions that might predict recurrent dislocations. Forty-five shoulders fit the following criteria for inclusion in our study: initial dislocation with no prior history of shoulder problems; confirmation of the dislocation radiographically or reduction by a physician; and arthroscopy within 10 days. The 42 men and 3 women had an average age of 21.2 years (range, 14 to 28 years). Mechanism of injury was a twisting of the arm into forced abduction and external rotation, a fall on the outstretched arm, or a direct blow to the shoulder. Based on this preliminary study of 45 shoulders, we present a classification of the lesions found in the acute shoulder dislocation. Group 1 (six shoulders) had capsular tears with no labral lesions: these shoulders were stable under anesthesia and had no or minimal hemarthrosis. Group 2 (11 shoulders) had capsular tears and partial labral detachments: these shoulders were mildly unstable and had mild to moderate hemarthrosis. Group 3 (28 shoulders) had capsular tears with labral detachments: these shoulders were grossly unstable and had large hemarthrosis. They had complete capsular/labral detachments. In the past, redislocation rates have been primarily related to age at the time of initial dislocation and, to a lesser degree, the period of immobilization. We have identified the intraarticular lesions in 45 patients with an initial anterior glenohumeral dislocation and classified these shoulders into three groups based on the lesions found. By doing so, we can develop a more accurate method of determining which shoulders are prone to recurrent dislocation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As well, a new radiopharmaceutical known as methoxy isobutyl isonitrile that has been shown to be taken up by muscle in direct proportion to its blood flow was used to illustrate the possible pathophysiology of this syndrome. Twenty patients with a history of chronic leg pain and possible diagnosis of CCS and five normal volunteers had preexercise and postexercise MRI, nuclear medicine imaging, and static and dynamic slit catheter pressure studies. Nine patients had classic symptoms; only five of these nine had abnormal pressure studies. The other 11 patients had an element of pain at rest and had normal pressure studies. The nuclear blood flow studies were normal in all 25 legs tested in this study. Measurement of intrinsic MRI parameters T1 and T2 in the normal legs as well as in those with an atypical history showed a marked elevation with exercise and a gradual return to baseline postexercise that was similar to the pressure curves. In the five patients with a clinical history and elevated pressures, four had abnormal MRI studies with failure of T1 to return to baseline values. Although these results demonstrate the potential of MRI as a tool for noninvasively monitoring muscle status, clinical history and examination remain important in the diagnosis of CCS. This study indicates that the pathophysiology of exertional compartment syndrome does not appear to be related to ischemia.\r"

The records of 131 patients were complete and available for retrospective review. Forty-five patients were diagnosed as having a chronic compartment syndrome (CCS) and seventy-five patients had the syndrome ruled out by intramuscular pressure recordings. The only significant difference found between the two groups on history and physical examination was a 45.9% incidence of muscle herniae in the patients with CCS, compared to a 12.9% incidence in those without the syndrome. One-third of the patients with the syndrome and over one-half of those without it reported persistent, moderate to severe pain at 6 month to 9 year followup. Modified, objective criteria were developed for the diagnosis of CCS. The criteria were based upon the intramuscular pressures recorded with the slit catheter before and after exercise in 210 muscle compartments without CCS. In the presence of appropriate clinical findings, we consider one or more of the following intramuscular pressure criteria to be diagnostic of chronic compartment syndrome of the leg: 1) a preexercise pressure greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg, 2) a 1 minute postexercise pressure of greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg, or 3) a 5 minute postexercise pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg.\r"

A patellar tendon autograft was placed anatomically and tensioned at 2 pounds for all of the groups. In the augmented animals, a 30 strand braided graft 10 cm in length of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was tightened with the knee in full extension. After 6 months of unrestricted cage activity the animals were sacrificed and biomechanical testing performed. The augmented patellar tendon autografts demonstrated less laxity in extension as compared to the autografts alone. A minimal decrease in the load and stiffness to failure for the augmented groups as compared to the nonaugmented knees was noted. However, both the reconstruction groups had a significant decrease in the load to failure at 6 months (50% of the normal ACL). In summary, this study demonstrated that a synthetic graft augmentation can be performed in the over-the-top position and minimize knee laxity, especially during terminal extension. With this technique, the laxity was minimized while the incorporation and strengthening of the biologic autograft occurred at a rate similar to the unaugmented reconstruction.\r"

Preliminary analysis performed in 1975 indicated that the majority of serious cervical spine football injuries were caused by axial loading. Based on this observation, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and National Federation of High School Athletic Associations (NFHSAA) implemented rule changes banning \"spearing\" and the use of the top of the helmet as the initial point of contact in striking an opponent during a tackle or block. Between 1976 and 1987, as a result of these rule changes, the Registry has documented a dramatic decrease in both the total number of cervical spine injuries and those resulting in quadriplegia at both the high school and college level. It is suggested that development and implementation of similar preventative measures based on clearly defined injury mechanisms would decrease injury rates in diving, rugby, ice hockey, trampolining, wrestling, and other high-risk sports as well.\r"

These studies demonstrate that denervation of the infraspinatus and/or supraspinatus muscle is not always due to entrapment of the nerve at the suprascapular or spinoglenoid notches, as is often proposed. Similar studies in healthy pitchers during spring training and again at midseason demonstrate that slowing of suprascapular nerve conduction is detectable in some cases as the season progresses. Sagittal sections of a cadaver with the arm fixed in the acceleration phase of the pitching motion demonstrate five possible sites of trauma to the suprascapular nerve. Mechanisms proposed to explain these progressive, but potentially reversible, changes include consideration of biomechanical factors as well as anatomical features. An alternative hypothesis to nerve trauma that explains this symptom complex is intimal damage to the axillary or suprascapular artery and subsequent production of microemboli which become trapped in the suprascapular nerve vasa nervorum.\r"

  ".W": "Collegiate rodeo athletes (N = 156) in the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) Southern Region, were examined for injuries during a 7 month (10 rodeo) season from 1987 to 1988. Sixty-two athletes sustained a total of 138 acute injuries resulting from 3292 exposures. One hundred twenty-seven injuries (92% of total injuries) occurred in the roughstock and steer wrestling events, and 11 injuries (8%) occurred in the roping and female events. When calculating opportunity for injury, rodeo athletes face an 89% potential for injury per season. Ninety-one of the injuries incurred were upper body injuries; 47 were lower body injuries. A 6:1 exposure to injury ratio among roughstock events exemplifies the magnitude of injury potential in this sport, affecting 25% of roughstock competitors. Contusions, strains, and concussions comprised 42%, 16%, and 11% of the total injuries, respectively, whereas fractures and dislocations comprised only 5% of the total. Twenty-three percent of the injuries occurred during the completion of an athlete's ride, with 21% of injuries attributed to equipment mishaps. Frequency of injury by performance, relation of seasonal participation and exposure to injury, orthotic care, use of conditioning programs, medication history, and need for enhanced sports medicine education in this sport are discussed.\r"

Pressures were recorded by the microcapillary infusion method and muscle blood flow by the 133-Xenon clearance technique. Muscle blood flow during constant exercise decreased from 34.5 (SD = 10.3) to 10.6 (SD = 4.9) ml/100 g/min (P less than 0.001) when muscle relaxation pressure was increased from 13.5 (SD = 2.7) to 39.9 (SD = 9.0) mm Hg by external compression. Muscle relaxation pressure during exercise is the intramuscular pressure between contractions. External compression of the lower limb during exercise impedes muscle blood flow by increasing muscle relaxation pressure. The experimental model seems suitable to study the influence of external compression by knee braces on intramuscular pressure during exercise.\r"

Information was collected on the nature of the mishap, the extent of injury, and the helmet status of the rider at the time of the fall. Fifty-seven percent of riders were wearing helmets during the mishap. Helmet wearers were significantly older than those not wearing helmets. Helmet wearers experienced significantly fewer skull fractures (1% versus 11%) and facial soft tissue injuries (5% versus 18%) than those not wearing helmets (chi 2 = 6.7, 6.5; P = 0.01, 0.01).

The diagnosis was confirmed in 252 (70%) of 362 patients. Ability to cultivate Leishmania was correlated with the concentration of amastigotes seen on thin smears. Leishmania were cultured in 42 (27%) of 153 patients with no amastigotes found in 400 oil-immersion fields and in 174 (83%) of 209 patients with at least 1 amastigote. No difference in diagnostic outcome was found when we compared smears or cultures taken from the center or the border of the ulcer or from an incision made tangential from the ulcer. We found no difference when we compared smears obtained with scalpels, capillary tubes, or dental broaches. The use of scrub brushes soaked in iodine neither decreased the rate of culturing parasites nor decreased contamination rates.\r"

When peripheral blood lymphocytes were co-cultured with BmA and PHA, BmA markedly suppressed the T cell proliferative response to PHA in both filarial patients and control individuals in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression resulted neither from any direct toxicity of BmA nor from nonspecific absorption of the PHA mitogenic activity by BmA. The major suppressive component appears to be phosphocholine (PC), an immunodominant molecule present in abundance on filarial parasites and on circulating filarial antigen. Both purified PC as well as PC-containing antigens affinity purified from BmA were capable of suppressing the proliferative responses of co-cultured autologous lymphocytes to PHA. The suppressive activity was not abolished by mitomycin-C treatment and was greater in patients with filariasis than in normal controls, suggesting that levels of PC-containing antigens determines the magnitude of the suppressive effect of PC-antigen. Further, as induction of the suppressive activity was completely abrogated when antigen pre-treated cells were T cell-depleted, the suppressive effect appears to be mediated primarily by T cells.\r"

DNA content was assessed by flow cytometric analysis, and each tumor was categorized as diploid or nondiploid. Of the parameters studied, Dukes' classification and tumor DNA content were found to be independent prognostic indicators.

Successful treatment outcomes (106 evaluable patients) were not statistically different among the three groups (Group 1, 64%; Group 2, 76%; and Group 3, 88%), but these data were difficult to interpret because, by chance, significantly more patients in Group 1 had bacteremia at entry (p less than 0.01), and patients in Group 3 had significantly more biliary tract infections (p less than 0.02) and significantly more favorable acute physiology scores (p less than 0.05). Use of metronidazole can reduce complications related to C. difficile, particularly if additional antimicrobials other than aminoglycosides are avoided.\r"

The postoperative 5-year survival rate was 50.3% for 160 patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery with dissection of group 1, 2, and 3 lymph nodes (R3), compared with 48.8% for 185 patients with dissection of group 1 and 2 lymph nodes (R2). There was no difference in terms of survival between the two groups of patients. Of 160 patients receiving R3, 19 (11.9%) were found to be positive for metastasis to group 3 lymph nodes, and only 5 survived for more than 5 years after surgery (postoperative 5-year survival rate of 26.3%). In four of these five patients, metastases in the group 3 lymph nodes were confined to nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Thus, it appears that in dissection of the deepest nodes, lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament are the most important to remove in the surgical treatment of advanced gastric cancer.\r"

  ".U": "90145360\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred forty-six patients with acute appendicitis were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group of 120 patients received systemic clindamycin preoperatively. Another group of 126 patients received, in addition to systemic clindamycin, a solution of topical ampicillin applied to subcutaneous tissues. No differences were found in the characteristics of the two groups. Combined prophylaxis with clindamycin and ampicillin significantly reduced wound infection to 4%, compared with clindamycin alone (p less than 0.02). A decrease in the surgical wound infection rate in the group treated with clindamycin and ampicillin was mainly observed in patients with advanced (gangrenous and perforated) appendicitis (p less than 0.05). A significant decrease in wound infection rates in patients with positive culture results was also found. We conclude that prophylaxis with a combination of systemic clindamycin and topical ampicillin solution, when compared with clindamycin alone, more effectively prevents wound infection after emergency appendectomy, especially in patients with serious wound contamination.\r"

  ".U": "90145361\r", 
  ".W": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is not a single disorder but a collection of abnormalities in the same anatomic area that elicit similar symptoms. The many causes of TOS are best classified into one of three groups: osseous, traumatic, and nontraumatic. Although patients with traumatic TOS constituted 86% of our last 600 patients with TOS who underwent surgical treatment, the precise mechanism underlying the condition remains obscure. To determine if there was microscopic abnormalities, 45 anterior and middle scalene muscles from patients with traumatic TOS were studied by means of histochemical stains applied after freezing of the muscles. The results revealed a consistent abnormal histologic pattern in patients with traumatic TOS: type II fibers were atrophied; there was an increase in the average number of type I fibers (78% versus 53% in muscles from control patients); and there was a significant increase (mean: 36%) in connective tissue (muscles from control patients averaged less than 15%). Although type II fiber atrophy and type I fiber predominance are seen in a variety of other conditions, their association with fibrosis is rare. Following neck injuries, the changes in the anterior and middle scalene muscles are compatible with trauma, suggesting that fibrotic scalene muscles are an important cause of symptoms in traumatic TOS.\r"

Eight of the rabbits underwent resection of 50% of the intestine. Serial samples of serum and peritoneal fluid showed that half of the triglyceride was absorbed within 1 hour in rabbits with intact viscera, but not until 2 hours in rabbits with intestinal resection. The caval-arterial gradient for triglycerides was consistently positive in rabbits with intact intestine, whereas it was smaller and erratic after intestinal resection. The portal-arterial gradient was never significantly different from zero. These data indicate that the major triglyceride absorption occurred across the visceral peritoneum through lymphatic vessels, with little portal venous absorption. Transperitoneal absorption of triglycerides occurred to a sufficient degree to provide substantial nutritional supplementation in rabbits with intact intestine; absorption was less in rabbits with intestinal resection.\r"

The adenylate energy charge of platelets decreased on the first, second, and third postoperative days in the cirrhotic group, whereas no significant decrease was found in the noncirrhotic group. A decrease in the percentage of adenosine triphosphate and an increase in that of hypoxanthine also occurred concomitant with a decrease in the adenylate energy charge, which was considered to be the result of an increased utilization of adenosine triphosphate. These findings indicate that in cirrhotic patients, the intravascular activation of platelets takes place and platelet function is damaged during the period immediately after hepatic resection, even when there is no clinical evidence of intravascular coagulation.\r"

There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to further analgesic requirements, complications, time to first bowel action, and duration of hospital stay. The definite advantage of caudal extradural bupivacaine for haemorrhoidectomy must be balanced against the rare but potentially serious complications associated with its use.\r"

The maximum point of transillumination was visible just distal to the cricoid cartilage, with proper cuff positioning. The lighted stylet was also introduced into the oesophagus to see whether transoesophageal illumination could be demonstrated. The intensity of transillumination was measured using a grading system. The distance between the bevel end of the tracheal tube and the carina was determined with a fibreoptic bronchoscope. Tracheal transillumination was graded as excellent in 81% of patients and as good in 19%, when the overhead lights were dimmed and cricoid pressure was applied. Transoesophageal illumination could not be demonstrated in any patient. The mean distance between the tip of the tracheal tube and the carina varied between 3.7 and 4 cm. Transtracheal illumination is a simple, effective and reliable method that can be used during intubation for the recognition of optimal tube placement.\r"

High flows during disconnexion result in significant pressure generation caused by outflow resistance of catheter mounts, heat and moisture exchangers, capnometer cuvettes, and angled connectors; this may lead to alarm failure because of incorrectly adjusted pressure alarm limits. The exact position of the disconnexion is critical and if the alarm's pressure sensor is placed in either the inspiratory or expiratory limb of the ventilator it makes no difference to its correct function. Nine different heat and moisture exchanges were compared in the same breathing system. Those with 15-mm male connectors generate the highest pressures on disconnexion (1.1 kPa). It is suggested that the low pressure alarm limit is set only marginally below the peak inspiratory pressure, and that it is readjusted for every patient and after every change in ventilation. Most importantly, the alarm should be shown to be functional by a trial disconnexion at the tracheal tube.\r"

  ".W": "Three techniques for blocking the sciatic nerve, differing in approach (posterior in group P; lateral in group L; and anterior in group A), were prospectively evaluated in 180 children who were also given light general anesthesia for surgery below the knee. Four anesthetic solutions with epinephrine (1% lidocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine, and two mixtures of 0.5% bupivacaine with either 1% lidocaine or 1% etidocaine) were administered to 15 patients in each group. The sciatic nerve was located by electrical stimulation or, when muscle twitches were not elicited, using a loss-of-resistance technique. Twitches were \"typical\" in 154 patients of whom 153 developed sciatic nerve block. In 26 patients twitches were atypical (eight patients) or absent (18 patients) and a sciatic block developed in only 13 patients (50%). The depth to which the needle was inserted was measured in each procedure; it varied according to patient's age and weight and was significantly less with the posterior approach than with either the lateral or anterior routes. The overall success rate exceeded 90% in the three groups but significantly fewer difficulties were encountered in group P than in group A. Although the spread of the anesthetic was different in the three groups, the distribution of anesthesia in the lower extremity was similar, including not only dermatomes supplied by the sciatic nerve, but also those supplied by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. No neurological sequelae were observed. It is concluded that the posterior and lateral approaches are the most suitable in children for blocking the sciatic nerve proximally.\r"

  ".W": "The cerebral and peripheral vascular effects of sufentanil (10-200 micrograms/kg) were examined in dogs. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured continuously by an electromagnetic flow probe on the outflow of the posterior sagittal sinus. Sufentanil at all doses significantly increased CBF that lasted for approximately 20 min. The CBF then gradually decreased so that it was significantly below baseline levels by the end of the 60-min study period. The transient increase in CBF was accompanied by an equally transient statistically significant decrease in cerebrovascular resistance. Intracranial pressure did not change. Sufentanil produced an electroencephalographic pattern of deep anesthesia accompanied by a decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption significantly below baseline levels. At the end of the study tissue concentrations of metabolites taken from the cerebral hemispheres were within normal limits, indicative of a normal cerebral energy state. Sufentanil had little effect on systemic hemodynamics. The observation that sufentanil significantly increases CBF in the absence of seizure activity makes it unique among the narcotics. It is hypothesized that in the presence of decreased intracranial compliance, this sudden increase in CBF, although transient, may be detrimental if it is accompanied by an acute increase in intracranial pressure which could produce cerebral ischemia.\r"

Blood flow measurements were made at four time periods: (a) initial supine; (b) after 5 min in the sitting position; (c) after 60 min in the sitting position; and (d) 15 min after resuming the supine position. Six dogs (group 1) served as a control group with a normal intracranial pressure (ICP). In five dogs (group 2) ICP was elevated with a parietal epidural balloon 1 h before the first measurements of blood flows were made. Saline was injected incrementally into the balloon so as to reach a steady-state ICP of 30 mm Hg for 1 h. Elevation of ICP in group 2 resulted in significantly lower CBF, SCBF, and CMRo2 compared with group 1. Postural changes in group 1 did not result in any significant change in blood flow measurements whereas in group 2, after 1 h in the sitting position, there were significant decreases in CBF and SCBF compared with the initial supine measurements. There was, however, no corresponding decrease in CMRo2 in group 2 with change in position. These data suggest that both the brain and spinal cord may be at risk for ischemia during sitting position procedures under general anesthesia in the presence of elevated ICP.\r"

In the present study, rapid and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of these antibodies have been evaluated. A recently described method that utilizes TFA-rabbit serum albumin as test antigen was studied employing a large population of halothane hepatitis and control patients. Several problems were discovered with the assay that were not previously recognized. The assay was then compared directly with methods that utilize as test antigens either liver microsomes or purified TFA proteins from halothane-treated rats. Sixty-seven percent of patients with a clinical diagnosis of halothane hepatitis tested positive for antibodies when the test antigens were either TFA-rabbit serum albumin or liver microsomes. This value was increased to 79% when the purified TFA-57 kDa, TFA-76 kDa, and TFA-100 kDa proteins were used as test antigens. These results indicate that the specificity and sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods for the detection of patients' antibodies may be increased significantly by utilizing the purified TFA microsomal proteins as test antigens.\r"

We used data from a large pediatric anesthesia follow-up program at Winnipeg Children's Hospital (1982-1987) to determine rates of perioperative adverse events among children of different ages. A check-off form was completed by a pediatric anesthesiologist for each case (n = 29,220) and a designated follow-up reviewer examined all anesthesia forms and hospital charts to ascertain adverse effects for children less than 1 mo, 1-12 mo, 1-5 yr, 6-10 yr, and 11-16 yr of age in the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative periods. The majority of the children were healthy, and 70% had no preoperative medical conditions. Infants less than 1 mo old were more likely to be undergoing major cardiac or vascular procedures, whereas the older children had mainly orthopedic or otolaryngologic procedures. Infants less than 1 mo old had the highest rate of adverse events both intraoperatively and in the recovery room. The main problem in this age group was related to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In children over 5 yr of age, postoperative nausea and vomiting was very frequent, with about one-third of the children experiencing this problem. When all events were considered (both major and minor), there was a risk of an adverse event in 35% of the pediatric cases. This contrasts with 17% for adults. This morbidity survey helps to focus on areas of intervention and for further study.\r"

The incidence of respiratory depression was significantly greater in groups 7 and 8 than in the other groups in the first 48 h. Vomiting occurred significantly more often in group 1 than in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5. Intraoperative cholangiography and the postoperative clinical course indicated no increase in tone of the sphincter of Oddi in any patient.

More than 80% of the abnormal UA results were historically known, clinically insignificant, or false-positives. Only five children had surgery canceled owing to abnormal laboratory tests: two owing to anemia, two to an abnormal UA, and one because of a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Both children with anemia were treated with iron and subsequently underwent surgery without complication. Of the abnormal UAs, one was contaminated, and the cancellation of surgery resulted in a complication requiring emergency surgery. The other abnormal UA was a probable asymptomatic bacteriuria, and the infant later underwent surgery uneventfully. These data suggest that a routine UA adds little to the preoperative evaluation of a healthy child, and should be omitted.\r"

Because cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass represent a major stress, the effects on intragastric pH of an H2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, and an M1-muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, were evaluated. Intragastric pH was measured throughout elective cardiac surgery in 60 patients by a digital pH-meter during fentanyl-diazepam-nitrous oxide (50%) anesthesia. The gastric content was sampled at closure of the chest for bacterial count. Oral preoperative medication given randomly included (n = 20 in each group) 0.3 mg/kg diazepam 1 h before induction (group 1); diazepam plus ranitidine (150 mg) 1 h before induction (group 2); and diazepam plus pirenzepine (50 mg) on the evening before surgery and 1 h before induction of anesthesia (group 3). At induction intragastric pH was higher in group 2 (mean +/- SD = 7.42 +/- 1.07) than in group 1 (5.28 +/- 2.14) (P less than 0.01) but was not significantly different in group 3 (5.78 +/- 1.89) than in group 1. In no group did intragastric pH change significantly during surgery. Gastric juice was sterile in 92% of group 1, in 25% of group 2, and in 71% of group 3 patients (P less than 0.01). Postoperatively no gastrointestinal complications occurred, but there was a trend toward more patients developing nosocomial pneumonias in groups 2 and 3 (15%) than in group 1 (0%) (P = 0.06). Intraoperative intragastric pH is relatively high after diazepam premedication, thus the preoperative addition of ranitidine or pirenzepine would not be necessary and may possibly be hazardous.\r"

A brief (6.0-13.0 min) infusion of atracurium was administered until twitch tension was suppressed by approximately 70%, and atracurium plasma concentration and twitch tension data were used to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for each patient. Total clearance (Cltotal) was similar in elderly and young adults. However, clearance via the liver and/or kidney (Clorgan) was lower in elderly patients, whereas clearance due to Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis (Clnonorgan) was higher. Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was larger in elderly patients. The increase in Vss without an age-related increase in Cltotal resulted in a longer elimination half-life [21.8 (+)/- 3.3 vs. 15.7 (+)/- 2.5 min (mean (+)/- SD)] in elderly patients. The steady state plasma concentration of atracurium required to suppress twitch tension by 50% was similar in elderly and young adults. The authors conclude that the pharmacokinetics, but not the pharmacodynamics, of atracurium differ significantly between elderly and young adults. As a result, repeated doses will be required with similar frequency in young and elderly adults, but recovery from comparable levels of neuromuscular blockade may be slightly prolonged in elderly patients.\r"

Echocardiographic contrast-enhanced regions of myocardial perfusion were easily visualized. Differences in contrast-enhanced myocardial regions depended on coronary artery occlusion or patency. The contrast-enhanced images of myocardial perfusion showed that, for a given myocardial segment of the supplying vessel, the presence or absence of contrast effect reliably predicted vessel occlusion or patency (P less than .01). In the future contrast echocardiography may allow the direct assessment of regional myocardial perfusion in the operating room.\r"

Skin exposure was interrupted when hot rod temperature had decreased to 45 degrees C. A full-thickness burn trauma of the skin was induced as judged from histologic sections. The burned skin was dissected and extravasation of Evans blue (EB) bound plasma albumin was quantified by a spectrophotometric technique and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. In the first set of experiments, one group of rats (n = 15) was topically treated with a lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% (25 mg of each in 1 g; EMLA) for 1.5 h starting 15 min after inducing the burn injury. In one control group (n = 14) the thermal injury was treated with placebo cream. A second control group (n = 15) was topically treated with placebo cream without being exposed to thermal trauma. Results showed a significant inhibition of EB-albumin extravasation in the skin of burned rats treated with lidocaine-prilocaine cream compared with placebo-treated burned skin (P less than 0.001). EB-albumin contents in the skin of burned rats treated with lidocaine-prilocaine cream did not differ significantly from unburned skin (P greater than 0.05). In the second set of experiments continuous iv lidocaine infusions at a rate of 5 (n = 10), 10 (n = 12), 20 (n = 10), or 30 (n = 10) micrograms.kg-1.min-1 was given.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unlabeled morphine, 3H-morphine, and 14C-morphine were simultaneously administered into the portal vein, femoral vein, and renal artery, respectively, first during pentobarbital anesthesia and second during halothane (1.5 MAC) anesthesia; blood samples were taken for estimation of unlabeled plasma morphine and M3G concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 3H- and 14C-morphine concentrations and corresponding M3G concentrations were determined by dual-channel liquid scintillation counting of the eluant corresponding to the appropriate peak on the HPLC. The portal clearance of morphine was not altered by halothane. However, intravenous (iv) morphine clearance (CLs) decreased (P less than 0.05) by 40% from 963 +/- 131 to 579 +/- 91 ml/min during halothane anesthesia, accompanied by an increase (P less than 0.05) in half-life from 78 +/- 8 to 106 +/- 8 min. The reduction in CLs of morphine occurred putatively on the basis of a halothane-induced decrease in hepatic blood flow, whereas morphine metabolism, reflected by morphine portal (intrinsic) clearance, was not significantly decreased by halothane. There was no significant effect of halothane on the partial metabolic clearance of morphine to M3G, and the ratio of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)-M3G to AUC unchanged morphine was not significantly altered by halothane, indicating that morphine glucuronidation is unaffected by halothane anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether prior administration ritodrine worsens maternal hypotension during epidural anesthesia in gravid ewes. Twenty-four experiments were performed in nine chronically instrumented animals between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. The experimental sequence included the following: 1) at time-zero, intravenous (iv) administration of ritodrine, 0.004 mg.kg-1.min-1, or normal saline (NS) for 2 h; 2) at 120 min discontinuation of ritodrine, and administration of a 500 ml iv bolus of NS over 15 min; and 3) at 135 min epidural injection of 2% lidocaine or NS. There were three groups of experiments: 1) iv ritodrine-epidural lidocaine (n = 9); 2) iv NS-epidural lidocaine (n = 8); and 3) iv ritodrine-epidural NS (n =7). Epidural injection of lidocaine resulted in a median sensory level of T9 in both the ritodrine-lidocaine and NS-lidocaine groups. At 165 min (i.e., 30 min after the epidural injection of lidocaine), maternal mean arterial pressure was 19 +/- 3% below baseline (P = 0.0001) in the ritodrine-lidocaine group and 22 +/- 7% below baseline (P = 0.0001) in the NS-lidocaine group (NS between groups). At 120 min ritodrine had increased maternal cardiac output 45 +/- 6% above baseline (P = 0.0001) in the ritodrine-lidocaine group and 39 +/- 6% above baseline (P = 0.0001) in the ritodrine-NS group. Cardiac output remained above baseline (P less than 0.01) after epidural injection of lidocaine in the ritodrine-lidocaine group. In contrast, in the NS-lidocaine group cardiac output was 13 +/- 5% below baseline (P = 0.005) at 150 min. Fetal arterial pH did not change significantly in either the ritodrine-lidocaine or ritodrine-NS group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ropivacaine is a new amino-amide local anesthetic whose anesthetic profile appears similar to that of bupivacaine. Moreover, in intact animals ropivacaine was reportedly less arrhythmogenic than bupivacaine. These experiments evaluated the cardiac transmembrane electrophysiologic effects of ropivacaine compared with those of lidocaine and bupivacaine in an isolated rabbit Purkinje fiberventricular muscle preparation. Only bupivacaine (3-5 micrograms/ml, 0.92-1.5 x 10(-5) m) significantly decreased Purkinje fiber maximum diastolic potential. Action potential amplitude and maximal rate of depolarization (Vmax) were significantly decreased by all agents in the following order: bupivacaine, ropivacaine, lidocaine. High concentrations of bupivacaine and ropivacaine caused premature depolarizations during phase 3 in some preparations. In addition, bupivacaine altered the action potential configuration by producing \"notching\" not seen with either ropivacaine or lidocaine. This may reflect effects caused by changes in Ca2+, K+, or electrotonic effects. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine (30 micrograms/ml, 9.2 x 10(-5) m) and lidocaine (100 micrograms/ml, 3.74 x 10(-4) m) caused Purkinje fiber inexcitability and Purkinje fiber-ventricular muscle conduction block. However, the duration of PF inexcitability following exposure to ropivacaine and lidocaine was significantly shorter than in bupivacaine-treated preparation. Duration of PF-VM conduction block also tended to be shorter for ropivacaine than bupivacaine, but significantly longer than lidocaine. In general, ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine but more potent than lidocaine in terms of its depressant effect on cardiac excitation and conduction.\r"

  ".W": "Etomidate is available in two different solvents: propylene glycol for induction of anesthesia and ethanol for maintenance of anesthesia. The direct effect of etomidate (1 and 5 micrograms/ml) and of its solvents on cardiac muscle was studied using rat left ventricular papillary muscle. Etomidate induced a slight positive inotropic effect in both solvents, as shown by an increase in maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax) but not in force. At 0.5 mM Ca++ 5 micrograms/ml etomidate increased Vmax (128 +/- 18%, P less than 0.05) but not force (103 +/- 16%, NS). Using various afterloaded twitches, the peak power output (Emax) was calculated: 1 and 5 micrograms/ml etomidate increased Emax (107 +/- 8%, P less than 0.05, and 108 +/- 10%, P less than 0.05, respectively). This increase was related to the increase in Vmax and not in isometric force. Etomidate did not modify the elastic components of papillary muscle, isometric relaxation, and contraction-relaxation coupling under high load. Several findings suggest that etomidate in propylene glycol impaired the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function: 1) it impaired the isotonic relaxation, the contraction-relaxation coupling under low load, and the load sensitivity of relaxation; and 2) it decreased postrest potentiated contraction, which is highly dependent on the SR. Nevertheless, alteration of SR function was only significant at high [Ca++]o and the beat-to-beat postrest recovery was not modified, indicating that the deleterious effects on SR function were moderate. The isotonic relaxation (max Vr) was more impaired by etomidate in propylene glycol (78 +/- 9%, P less than 0.001) and by propylene glycol alone (69 +/- 9%, P less than 0.001) than by etomidate in ethanol (97 +/- 12%, NS) and by ethanol alone (92 +/- 8%, P less than 0.05). This suggests that propylene glycol was responsible for the decrease in SR function. Etomidate in propylene glycol thus has a dual action on rat myocardium: 1) a slight positive inotropic effect due to etomidate per se, and 2) a slight decrease in SR function probably related to propylene glycol. However, because etomidate in propylene glycol induced a slight decrease in isometric force under certain experimental conditions (i.e., after isometric stabilization), etomidate in propylene glycol may induce a slight negative inotropic effect in some clinical conditions as a result of its dual action on the myocardium.\r"

Two hours after the thiopental bolus, all animals received an intravenous (iv) infusion of bupivacaine (1 mg.kg-1 min-1). The control group (5 animals) received bupivacaine only. The Mg++ group (5 animals) received MgSO4 140 mg/kg iv and 80 mg.kg-1 h-1 15 min prior to beginning the bupivacaine infusion. Lead II ECG, cardiac hemodynamics, and two-channel EEG were continuously monitored. Serum magnesium concentrations in the Mg++ group rose from 0.67 mM (1.3 mEq/L) to 2.42 mM (4.8 mEq/L). The bupivacaine infusion caused PR and QRS interval prolongation in both groups, but QRS widening was greater in the control group. QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTIc) lengthened only in the control group. A depression of left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) occurred to an equal extent in both groups.

  ".W": "We measured changes in methacholine bronchial hyperreactivity and airways obstruction in 37 asthmatics treated with inhaled triamcinolone for 6 weeks. All received regular bronchodilator therapy but not steroids or cromolyn. Initial studies included spirometry and the provocative concentration of methacholine required to decrease the FEV1 by 20% (PC20). Patients were randomized into two groups: those given inhaled triamcinolone, 200 micrograms four times daily (T) by metered dose inhaler, and those given a placebo inhaler (P). Daily AM and PM peak flow measurements were recorded, while PC20 and pulmonary function tests were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks. Change in canister weight was used to determine treatment compliance. The PC20 of T increased from a baseline 1.00 mg/mL to 2.90 mg/mL at 6 weeks, whereas in P it decreased from 1.15 mg/mL to 1.05 mg/mL. Percent change in PC20 (delta PC20) for each patient was defined as: [(PC20(week 6)--PC20(baseline]/PC20 (baseline)] X 100. At 6 weeks, this was 290% in T versus 65% in P (P less than .05). Likewise, at 6 weeks T was significantly greater than P with respect to: delta FEV1 (4.1% versus -3.8%, P less than .05) and delta FEF25-75% (20.3% versus -5.6%, P less than .01). Patients were further separated into higher and lower complier subgroups. In T, higher compliers showed more improvement at 6 weeks than lower compliers in: delta PC20 (533.3 versus 67.8%, P less than .05), delta FEV1 (8.7 versus -1.7%, P less than .01), and delta FEF25-75% (31.9 versus 1.1%, P less than .01). These data suggest that triamcinolone improves bronchial hyperreactivity as well as airways obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 29 IgE-binding components of D. farinae extracts were identified and distributed over the molecular weight range of 13 to 140 kilodaltons (kD). Each component had 3% to 73% frequencies of recognition by individual patient serum, and the major antigenicity of D. farinae was considered to exist in components of 13 to 16 kD, 25 to 30 kD, and 43 to 60 kD. These observations suggested that antigenicity of D. farinae is not restricted to one major allergen, but several components account for the total allergenic activity of D. farinae. We could also demonstrate 27 IgG-binding components of D. farinae antigen. Their frequencies and strength of binding were similar to IgE. IgG4 antibodies in patients with bronchial asthma bound to components with molecular weights 13, 25, 43, and 50 kD had relatively low frequencies of binding to IgE antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-four Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admissions for acute severe asthma in 27 children between 8/80 and 10/86 were reviewed to determine the safety of prolonged administration of frequently nebulized terbutaline. The mean dose of nebulized terbutaline was 0.2 mg/kg/dose (range = 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/dose) given at a mean frequency of 2.4 +/- 1.2 hours. Seven patients received continuous nebulization at a dose of 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/h. All patients were placed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Emergency room therapy was determined by the primary emergency room physicians. Upon admission to the PICU, the mean +/- SD heart rate was 150 +/- 21 bpm and the respiratory rate was 44 +/- 16 bpm. After institution of therapy, these parameters decreased to a similar degree in parallel. The maximum decrease after 36 hours was 28% and 37% for heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively. No cardiac arrhythmias were noted. The initial PaCO2 upon admission to the PICU was 32 mm Hg (range = 24 to 44 mm Hg), the maximum decrease in PaCO2 generally occurred during the 6-hour to 12-hour time interval following admission. We conclude that frequent administration of high doses of nebulized terbutaline is safe in the management of acute severe childhood asthma even in the setting of prolonged administration to the hospitalized child.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperacute T waves (HATWs) have been described as tall-amplitude, primary T-wave abnormalities sometimes seen in the early phases of transmural myocardial infarction. Despite numerous human and animal studies addressing the presence and significance of HATWs, there are no widely held, reliable ECG criteria for their accurate identification. Using a specially designed computer program on a Hewlett-Packard Realm ECG analysis system, we screened 13,393 adult ECGs to identify those having T-wave amplitudes greater than accepted standards (limb leads, greater than 0.5 mV; precordial leads, greater than 1.0 mV). Patients with other known causes of primary and secondary tall T waves were excluded from the study sample. Patients with tall-amplitude T-waves who then developed clinically verifiable myocardial infarction were labeled the HATW group. The HATW group (21) represented 4.1% of the tall T wave group (513) and 0.16% of the entire sample. The remaining patients, who did not meet HATW criteria, were called the early repolarization variant (ERV) group (51). Both groups underwent comparative computer morphology analysis. Nine parameters were statistically significant in discriminating HATWs from early repolarization variants. A combination of J-point position/T-wave amplitude of more than 25%, T-wave amplitude/QRS amplitude of more than 75%, J-point position of more than 0.30 mV, and age of more than 45 years predicted HATWs from a control group with a specificity of 98.0% and a sensitivity of 61.9% and with positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 86.2%, respectively. We conclude that HATWs have characterizable discriminating ECG morphology as determined by computer ECG analysis compared with a control group.\r"

The majority of physicians (76%) usually notified the family in person and spent an average of 15 +/- 11 minutes with the family. Subsequent contact with survivors, such as sending sympathy cards, making follow-up calls, or reporting autopsy results, was relatively infrequent. While 94% of our sample group reported a need for training in this area, less than one half received any training during medical school or residency. We suggest implementation of educational programs for physicians and development of outreach programs for survivors.\r"

  ".W": "Additive red blood cells (RBCs) have replaced packed RBCs for treatment of massive hemorrhage in many medical centers. Modifications in transfusion apparatus and RBC viscosity were tested for their ability to provide rapid flow of additive RBCs. Infusions through standard transfusion tubing and three types of large-bore transfusion tubing were compared using three large-bore catheters, two infusion pressures, and additive RBCs of three different viscosities. More than 13 minutes were required to infuse 1 unit 4 C RBCs using current accepted practice (16-gauge catheter, standard tubing, gravity flow). The most rapid technique resulted in an infusion time of 20 +/- 1 seconds for 22 C blood. The addition of pressure infusion, large-bore tubing, or an 8F catheter to a transfusion system reduced infusion times up to 74%, 82%, and 85%, respectively. The combination of all three techniques resulted in a maximum improvement of 96%. Saline predilution and warming did not consistently provide clinically important differences in infusion time but may be important for avoidance of hypothermia. Spectrophotometric measurement of free hemoglobin demonstrated no clinically significant hemolysis secondary to rapid infusion. Clinical management should address potential hypocalcemia and coagulopathy. We conclude that large-bore tubing, pressure infusion, and an 8F catheter can provide important decreases in infusion time of additive RBCs without evidence of significant hemolysis.\r"

Radiation film badges and thermoluminescent dosimeter finger rings were permanently attached to leaded aprons worn by emergency medicine residents during all trauma resuscitations. One set of apron and finger ring dosimeters was designated for the resident who managed the airway and stabilized the neck, when necessary, during cervical spine radiography (A-CS resident). A separate set of dosimeters was designated for the resident supervising the resuscitation. During the study period, 150 major trauma patients requiring 481 radiographic studies were treated. The mean monthly cumulative whole body exposures were 136.7 +/- 85.0 and 103.3 +/- 60.3 mrem for A-CS and supervising residents, respectively. The mean weekly cumulative extremity exposures were 523.3 +/- 611.0 and 46.7 +/- 18.6 mrem for A-CS and supervising residents, respectively. Calculated whole body exposures per patient were 2.7 mrem for the A-CS resident and 2.1 mrem for the supervising resident. Calculated extremity exposures per patient were 41.9 +/- 48.9 and 3.7 +/- 1.5 mrem, respectively. To exceed the annual whole body exposure limit established by the National Council of Radiologic Protection, the A-CS resident, working 200 shifts per year, would have to treat 9.2 trauma patients per shift. To exceed the annual extremity exposure limit, the A-CS resident would have to treat 5.9 trauma patients per shift. Of note, European exposure limits are 10% of current US limits. We conclude that significant exposures may occur to physicians working in trauma centers and that the use of shielding devices is indicated.\r"

We studied 70 consecutive patients with penetrating cardiac injuries to determine the relationships among prehospital procedures, time consumed in the field, and ultimate patient outcome. Thirty-one patients sustained gunshot wounds, and 39 had stab wounds. The mean Revised Trauma Score was 2.8 +/- 0.5. Paramedics spent an average of 10.7 +/- 0.5 minutes at the scene. Seventy-one percent of the patients underwent endotracheal intubation; 93% had at least one IV line inserted; and 57% had two IV lines inserted. Twenty-one (30%) survived. There was no correlation between on-scene time and either the total number of procedures performed (r = .17, P = .17) or IV lines established (r = .06, P = .6). On-scene times did not differ regardless of whether endotracheal intubation or pneumatic antishock garment applications occurred. We conclude that well-trained urban paramedics can perform multiple life-support procedures with very short on-scene times and a high rate of patient survival and that prehospital trauma systems require a minimum obligatory on-scene time to locate patients and prepare them for transport.\r"

The response rate by those whose mail survey could be delivered to a valid address was 41% (women, 63%; men, 37%; mean age, 38 +/- 1 years; health care providers, 87%; laypersons, 11%; and public safety workers, 2%). Of those surveyed, 49% had performed CPR within the past three years. Of these, 40% reported having hesitated to provide MTM ventilation at least once. Of those who had hesitated, more than one half identified fear of exposure to disease as the reason for their hesitation. Forty percent of all respondents had witnessed another provider hesitate to provide MTM ventilation. When presented with mock rescue scenarios, the majority of respondents indicated that they would not perform or would hesitate to perform MTM ventilation on most adult strangers. More than half felt that there was some risk of contracting AIDS from ventilating a manikin, and 71% said that their attitudes about providing CPR to strangers had changed as a result of the AIDS epidemic. We conclude that concern about AIDS appears to be adversely affecting the attitudes, beliefs, and self-reported behaviors of BCLS instructors in Virginia regarding the use of MTM ventilation on strangers.\r"

A retrospective study of our experience with prehospital defibrillation was conducted to define the relationship between rapid delivery of first countershock and survival, determine whether a relationship exists between the number of countershocks delivered and the save rate, and assist clinicians with general guidelines for termination of advanced life support efforts in the presence of ventricular fibrillation refractory to multiple defibrillation attempts. During the ten-year study period, adult, nontraumatic, nonpoisoned, witnessed arrests with an initial rhythm of coarse ventricular fibrillation were reviewed. Of 1,497 patients, 25% survived, 13% were paramedic-witnessed (PW) arrests, and 87% were non-paramedic-witnessed (NPW) arrests. The mean PW shock time, defined as time from arrest to first shock, was 1.6 +/- 3.7 minutes with a save rate of 37%. The mean NPW shock time was 10.2 +/- 5.1 minutes with a save rate of 23% (P less than or equal to .001). Thirty-two percent of PW arrests were converted to a spontaneous rhythm with pulses after the first countershock compared with 9% of NPW arrests (P less than or equal to .001). There was a dramatic decrease in PW arrests obtaining a perfusing rhythm after the first countershock attempt with each minute delay in electrical countershock up to three minutes; a plateau effect was evident after three minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant difference in survival was noted for bleeding rates of 15 mL/min for either short or long time; a small but statistically significant increase in survival was noted for bleeding rates of 25 mL/min and long transport times. For both short and long times, all higher bleeding rates showed greater survival with prehospital fluid resuscitation and higher blood pressure at the onset of definitive care.\r"

However, outcome data substantiating the benefit of these services have been slow in coming. From February 22, 1982, through March 5, 1984, Airlift Northwest transported 118 trauma patients (aged 15 years and older) an average distance of 340 miles (range, 100 to 800 miles) with fixed-wing aircraft. The in-hospital mortality for this group was 19% compared with 18% for a comparable group of trauma patients who were ground-transported from within the city limits of Seattle, Washington. The two groups did not differ significantly in age, Injury Severity Score, or Glasgow Coma Score. These results suggest that some part of the clinical benefit of a regional trauma center may be extended up to 800 miles with no increase in transport-related mortality.\r"

A two-part study was undertaken to determine which vital signs are taken in the field assessment of pediatric patients and to determine whether the frequency of vital signs taken is influenced by base station contact, patient's severity of illness or injury, or paramedic demographic factors such as parenting and field experience. An initial pilot study of prehospital care records (run sheets) from two base hospitals in Los Angeles County revealed that there were significant differences between field vital sign assessment in pediatric and adult patients (P less than .0001). A retrospective review of 6,756 pediatric run sheets from Los Angeles County showed that the frequency of vital sign assessment varied with the age of the pediatric patient (P less than .05) (ie, the frequency of vital sign assessment increased correspondingly with the age of the patient). Base hospital contact occurred in 26% of the runs; when contact was made, vital signs were more likely to be taken in all age groups studied. Vital signs often were not assessed in children less than 2 years old, even if the patient's chief complaint suggested the possibility of a major illness or trauma. The second part of the study was a field assessment survey that was distributed to 1,253 active paramedics in Los Angeles County; the results showed that paramedics were less confident in their ability to assess vital signs in children less than 2 years old. Confidence increased with age of the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine other reasons for differences in survival rates, we reviewed published studies conducted from 1967 to 1988 on 39 emergency medical services programs from 29 different locations. These programs could be grouped into five types of prehospital systems based on the personnel who deliver CPR, defibrillation, medications, and endotracheal intubation; the five systems were three types of single-response systems (basic emergency medical technician [EMT], EMT-defibrillation [EMT-D], and paramedic) and two double-response systems (EMT/paramedic and EMT-D/paramedic). Reported discharge rates ranged from 2% to 25% for all cardiac rhythms and from 3% to 33% for ventricular fibrillation. The lowest survival rates occurred in single-response systems and the highest rates in double-response systems, although there was considerable variation within each type of system. Hypothetical survival curves suggest that the ability to resuscitate is a function of time, type, and sequence of therapy. Survival appears to be highest in double-response systems because CPR is started early. We speculate that early CPR permits definitive procedures, including defibrillation, medications, and intubation, to be more effective.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), or scleroderma, is a disease of unknown etiology that involves many organ systems, including the lungs. The interstitial lung disease of systemic sclerosis is becoming an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. This process has been previously evaluated with single-site bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), gallium scanning, pulmonary function testing, and, occasionally, by open lung biopsy. As BAL has been shown to correlate well with open lung biopsy in systemic sclerosis, we sought to determine if single-site BAL accurately reflects alveolitis in a second site in the lung, and if BAL results correlate with other noninvasive tests of lung inflammation: gallium uptake, chest radiography, or arterial blood gas analysis. We performed 17 studies in 13 patients with scleroderma and found no significant lobar differences in lavage results or gallium scanning. By our criteria for normal versus active alveolitis, only two of 17 patient lavages would have been classified as normal by one side and abnormal by the other side. Although percent gallium uptake was equal bilaterally and supported the concept of alveolitis uniformity, gallium uptake intensity did not correlate with activity as measured by BAL. Furthermore, chest radiograph and arterial blood gas analysis did not correlate with BAL results or gallium scanning. We believe these data support the suitability of single-site lavage in the investigation of systemic-sclerosis-associated alveolitis and diminish the importance of gallium scanning in the investigation of systemic sclerosis pulmonary disease.\r"

We observed significant elevations of the DHLNL:HLNL ratio in patients with ARDS, and significant increases in the content of OHP in lungs of patients with ILD. These results are consistent with data from animal models of fibrotic lung disease, suggesting that increases in the DHLNL:HLNL ratio of lung collagen may serve as a marker of an acute fibrotic episode, whereas increased lung collagen OHP content serves as a marker of chronic lung fibrosis. We suggest that the underlying mechanism for the changes in DHLNL content in (pre)fibrotic acutely injured lung tissue and in OHP content in long-term fibrosis may be an increase in the activity of lysyl hydroxylase, a key intracellular enzyme responsible for a specific post-translational modification of collagen.\r"

A bronchoscope 6.0 mm in diameter wedged in an airway was used to lavage a segment of lung with four cycles of instillation and aspiration of the lavage solution containing a radioactive tracer (technetium pertechnetate, 99mTcO4-). Errors caused by the fall in concentration of the tracer during the lavage were minimized by extrapolating the tracer concentration back to time zero when the lavage solution had mixed with the ELF, but had not had time to be affected by loss of the tracer or influx of fluid from the interstitium. In control sheep, the ELF of these lavaged segments had a mean volume of 1.6 +/- 1.0 ml and a mean protein concentration that was 26 +/- 19% of the protein concentration measured in the plasma. Increasing the left atrial pressure 19 +/- 5 cm H2O to cause \"cardiac lung edema\" had no significant effect on the ELF volume, but it increased the mean protein concentration to 57 +/- 30% of the plasma value (p less than 0.01). Lung injury caused by intravenous oleic acid caused lung edema, increased the mean ELF volume to 6.8 +/- 2.2 ml, and increased the mean ELF protein concentration to 86 +/- 26% of the plasma value (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of those with pleural fibrosis (n = 334), 78% had circumscribed plaques and 22% had diffuse pleural thickening involving the costophrenic angle. Factors that were found to be associated with the presence and type of pleural fibrosis included increased age (p less than 0.001), more years in the trade (p less than 0.0001), more years since first exposure to asbestos (p less than 0.0001), more pack-years of cigarette smoking (p less than 0.01), and the presence and degree of interstitial fibrosis (p less than 0.0001). After controlling for these potential confounders (age, years in the trade, latency, pack-years of smoking, and ILO profusion category), linear multivariate regression models demonstrated that both circumscribed plaques (p = 0.007) and diffuse pleural thickening (p = 0.008) were independently associated with decrements in FVC but not with decrements in the FEV1/FVC ratio. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effect of diffuse pleural thickening on decrements in FVC is approximately twice as great as that seen with circumscribed pleural plaques. We conclude that the presence and type of pleural fibrosis among asbestos-exposed workers is independently associated with a pattern of spirometry that is suggestive of an underlying restrictive defect in lung function.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the isolated effect of an abnormal increase in abdominal compliance on the pattern of chest wall motion during breathing, we have studied seven patients with complete transection of the midthoracic cord (Th4-Th7). Measurements of chest wall motion were obtained with magnetometers, and concentric needle electrodes were used to record the electromyograms of various respiratory muscles. When breathing quietly in the seated posture, all patients had phasic inspiratory activity in both the scalenes and the parasternal intercostals in the cranial interspaces, and the upper and lower rib cage anteroposterior (AP) diameters increased proportionately and in phase. This confirms that the scalenes and the cranial parasternal intercostals are important determinants of the inspiratory expansion of the rib cage in humans. In six of the seven patients, however, the inspiratory increase in abdomen AP diameter was disproportionately larger than the increase in lower rib cage AP diameter. As a result, the tidal breathing loop was displaced to the right of the relaxed thoracoabdominal configuration. Binding the abdomen reduced or suppressed this deformation. These observations thus indicate that an isolated increase in abdominal compliance may cause the chest wall to depart from its relaxed configuration during breathing. This departure probably results from a combination of two factors: (1) a reduction in the rib cage expanding action of the diaphragm, and (2) a decrease in the activation of the rib cage inspiratory muscles relative to the diaphragm.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the measurement of TAA is useful in the assessment of lung mechanics in infants with AO, we have used respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) to quantity TAA. We compared changes in TAA to changes in lung mechanics before and after aerosolized bronchodilator (BD) administration in 13 infants. Abdominal wall (AB) and rib cage (RC) motion were displayed on an X-Y recorder in a Lissajous figure. Asynchrony between RC and AB motion was quantified by comparing the width m of the Lissajous figure (difference between AB inspiratory and expiratory positions) at mid-RC excursion with the total AB excursion at its extremes (s). Phase angle phi ws computed as sin phi = m/s (or phi = 180 degrees - mu, where sin mu = m/s for phase angles greater than 90 degrees) and was taken as a measure of TAA. Lung resistance RL and elastance EL were calculated from esophageal pressure (Pes), mouth pressure, tidal volume, and tidal flow. All infants displayed TAA at baseline. After BD administration, TAA decreased in those infants in whom RL decreased. The percentage decrease in the phase angle from baseline after BD administration was significantly correlated with the decrease in peak-to-peak Pes (delta Pes) and the percentage decrease in RL and EL. We conclude that AO in infants leads to TAA through altered pleural pressure swings acting on the compliant chest wall. Changes in lung mechanics induced by bronchodilators are reflected in changes in TAA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We questioned whether using a one-way valve to prevent exhalation would allow rest between inspiratory efforts and cause volume to cumulate during successive tidal efforts, improving both the depth and duration of the inspiratory maneuver. We studied 26 cooperative but naive patients recovering from surgery, trauma, or critical illness whose pain or weakness impaired ability to achieve and sustain deep inspiration. All subjects breathed via mouthpiece from a spirometer prefilled with 100% oxygen. Three different maneuvers were performed in random order by all subjects: (1) standard inspiratory capacity without valve or inspiratory hold, (2) inspiratory capacity (IC) with breathholding aided by a one-way valve, and (3) uncoached breath-stacking, during which successive tidal breaths were cumulated by one-way valving. A fourth maneuver was added in the last 13 subjects studied: an initial coached IC effort with subsequent valved stacking of tidal efforts. When compared with IC, \"breath stacking\" (valved) maneuvers increased inspired volume by an average of 15 to 20% (p less than 0.05). More importantly, there was a severalfold increase in the time over which high lung volume was sustained (p less than 0.001). Our results indicate that one-way valving helps to achieve and sustain deep inspiration, even in uncoached patients.\r"

  ".W": "From 1963 to 1986, the number of reported cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in the United States declined an average of 5.0% annually, and the number of cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis declined an average of 0.9% annually over the same period. In 1986, 17.5% of all cases of tuberculosis were extrapulmonary. Of pulmonary cases, 63.0% occurred among racial ethnic minorities and the foreign-born, whereas of extrapulmonary cases, the respective proportion was 71.2%. After adjustment for other variables, the proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis among all patients with tuberculosis by age was found to be largest in children and generally to decrease with increasing age, larger among black, Asian, and American Indian than among non-Hispanic white patients, larger among female than among male patients, and larger among the foreign-born than among patients born in the United States. The smaller decline in extrapulmonary tuberculosis over the years may be partially due to changes in the demographic characteristics of patients with tuberculosis. Considerable differences in susceptibility to different sites of extrapulmonary tuberculosis by age, race/ethnicity, sex, and country of origin were found. The reasons for these differences remain largely unexplained.\r"

  ".W": "In the first of three studies investigating the widely held belief that \"milk produces mucus,\" 60 volunteers were challenged with rhinovirus-2, and daily respiratory symptoms and milk and dairy product intake records were kept over a 10-day period. Nasal secretion weights were obtained by weighing tissues collected and sealed immediately after use. Information was obtained on 51 subjects, yielding 510 person-days of observation. Subjects consumed zero to 11 glasses of milk per day (mean, 2.7; SE, 0.08), and secretion weights ranged from zero to 30.4 g/day (mean, 1.1; SE, 0.1). In response to an initial questionnaire, 27.5% reported the practice of reducing intake of milk or dairy products with a cold or named milk or dairy products as bad for colds. Of the latter group, 80% stated the reason as \"producing more mucus/phlegm.\" Milk and dairy product intake was not associated with an increase in upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms of congestion or nasal secretion weight. A trend was observed for cough, when present, to be loose with increasing milk and dairy product intake; however, this effect was not statistically significant at the 5% level. Those who believe \"milk makes mucus\" or reduce milk intake with colds reported significantly more cough and congestion symptoms, but they did not produce higher levels of nasal secretions. We conclude that no statistically significant overall association can be detected between milk and dairy product intake and symptoms of mucus production in healthy adults, either asymptomatic or symptomatic, with rhinovirus infection.\r"

Pulmonary and cardiovascular variables were measured before and following 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cumulative min of aerosol inhalation. Subjects inhaled 1 to 30 micrograms (2.5-microns particles) or 2 to 50 micrograms (5-microns particles) of isoproterenol. Pulmonary but not cardiac responses were significantly greater for the 2.5-microns particles as compared to equivalent doses of 5-microns particles. Pulmonary dose-related response differences were particularly marked for variables associated with small airway function (FEF25-75 and FEF75-85). These findings suggest that small particles penetrate more deeply into the lung and thereby more effectively dilate small airways and that small amounts of appropriately sized inhaled bronchodilator may produce considerable therapeutic effects.\r"

  ".W": "The recent development of a sensitive two-site monoclonal antibody immunoassay for the major cat allergen (Fel d I) has made it possible to make accurate measurements of airborne cat allergen using low volume samplers that do not disturb the room. Houses with cats had from 2 to 20 ng Fel d I/m3 air compared with less than 0.2 ng/m3 in houses without cats. Using a cascade impactor and a multistage liquid impinger, the particle size distribution of airborne Fel d I in nine houses was 75% on particle greater than or equal to 5 microns in diameter and 25% (range, 10 to 62%) on particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns. In a cat vivarium with 12 cats, the air contained 40 ng Fel d I/m3, but less than 2% was detected on particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns. The air exchange rate in the vivarium (approximately 15 changes/h) appears to be the major difference from domestic houses (less than 0.5 changes/h). Repeated studies in one house confirmed a very high proportion (approximately 60%) of Fel d I on small particles. During domestic cleaning, the levels of small particle allergen in this house approached those produced by a nebulizer for bronchial provocation, i.e., 40 ng/m3. These results show unequivocally that significant airborne Fel d I is associated with small particles, which remain airborne for long periods. These findings are strikingly different from previous results obtained with airborne dust mite allergen. The results provide an explanation for the distinctive rapid onset of asthma or rhinitis in patients allergic to cats and a basis for designing a policy to reduce airborne allergen in houses with cats.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to test whether prior exposure to a low concentration of ozone (120 ppb) would condition airways in asthmatic subjects to respond to a subthreshold concentration of sulfur dioxide (100 ppb). Eight male and five female subjects 12 to 18 yr of age participated. They all had allergic asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm. Subjects were exposed to three test atmosphere sequences during intermittent moderate exercise (a 45-min exposure to one pollutant followed by a 15-min exposure to the second pollutant). The sequences were: air followed by 100 ppb SO2, 120 ppb O3 followed by 120 ppb O3, and 120 ppb O3 followed by 100 ppb SO2. The pulmonary function measurements assessed were FEV1, total respiratory resistance (RT), and maximal flow (Vmax50). Air-SO2 and O3-O3 exposures did not cause significant changes in pulmonary function. On the other hand, exposure to 100 ppb SO2 after a 45-min exposure to 120 ppb O3 caused a significant (8%) decrease in FEV1 (p = 0.046), a significant (19%) increase in RT (p = 0.048), and a significant (15%) decrease in Vmax50 (p = 0.008). It is concluded that prior O3 exposure increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness in these subjects such that they responded to an ordinarily subthreshold concentration of SO2. These data suggest that assessment of pulmonary changes to single pollutant challenges overlooks the interactive effects of common coexisting or sequentially occurring air pollutants.\r"

  ".W": "Whether short-term exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) enhances airway responsiveness in asthmatic subjects is controversial. Because it is well established that asthma is associated with increased airway responsiveness to another common air pollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2), we examined whether short-term exposure of asthmatic subjects to 0.3 ppm NO2 potentiates airway responsiveness to inhaled SO2. We exposed nine subjects with clinically stable asthma to 0.3 ppm NO2 or filtered air in an environmental room for 30 min on 2 separate days at least 1 wk apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion. A questionnaire about common symptoms related to inhaled irritants was completed before and immediately after each exposure. Each subject exercised (60 to 80 W) on a cycloergometer during the first 20 min of each exposure. We measured specific airway resistance (SRaw) and FEV1/FVC before, 5 min after, and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 exposure. The single-breath nitrogen test (SBN2) was also performed before and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 exposures and closing volume was determined; subsequently, SO2 dose-response curves (0.25 to 4.0 ppm) were performed via a mouthpiece. Each dose of SO2 was inhaled at a minute ventilation of 20 L/min for 4 min and was doubled until SRaw increased by at least 8 U above baseline. The dose of SO2 required to provoke an increase in SRaw of 8 U above baseline was determined by linear interpolation from the dose-response curve (PD8Uso2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tracheas from control rats or rats sensitized to egg albumin (EA) were studied in vitro in Ussing chambers, and changes in short-circuit current (Isc) induced by the addition of antigen or agonists on the mucosal (luminal) side were recorded. Addition of EA (100 micrograms/ml) to tracheas from sensitized but not from control rats caused a slow increase of Isc beginning after 15 to 30 s and maximal at 3 to 4 min. This response was inhibited in the presence of doxantrazole, a mucosal mast-cell-stabilizing agent, but not by sodium cromoglycate. A separate group of rats was treated neonatally with capsaicin to deplete peptide neurotransmitters. Responses to EA were significantly lower in capsaicin-treated, sensitized rats than in untreated, sensitized control littermates. No difference was seen in the level of serum EA-specific IgE in these two groups. In tracheas from untreated rats, addition of substance P, capsaicin, platelet-activating factor, and acetylcholine caused an immediate and marked increase in Isc. Responses to substance P and acetylcholine were unaffected by capsaicin treatment. However, responses to capsaicin itself and also to PAF were reduced. These data indicate that changes of net ion transport across the airway epithelium are early phenomena of local hypersensitivity reactions, and that neurotransmitters such as substance P may play an important role in the control of these phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "Mast cells and neuropeptide-containing nerves occur in close proximity throughout the mucosa. The vasodilation that characteristically occurs after mast cell mediator release in skin is dependent upon sensory nerve activation with neuropeptide release. It was therefore of interest to examine the relationship between antigen-induced mast cell activation, vascular permeability, and the influence of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves in the airways. To examine this question, capsaicin was administered systemically and the \"desensitization\" of the animals to topical capsaicin confirmed. Thereafer, capsaicin-desensitized animals were studied to see if mast cell mediator-induced vascular permeability was affected. Plasma protein extravasation (PPE) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intratracheal infusion of capsaicin or by intratracheal infusion of mouse serum albumin-dinitrophenol (MSA-DNP) after passive sensitization with IgE-anti-DNP. Leaking vessels in the airways were localized by using Monastral blue B, a macromolecular tracer. In the trachea, leaking vessels were predominantly located in the anterior wall after capsaicin challenge and in the posterior wall after antigen challenge. PPE was quantified by preinjecting animals with 125I-labeled BSA and expressed as microliter of plasma deposited in the trachea, bronchi, lungs, and tracheobronchial lavage (TBL). Within one minute after challenge, concentrations of capsaicin greater than 10(-7) M significantly increased PPE in trachea and bronchial wall (+ 160% and + 175% above control, respectively, with 10(-5) M). PPE was also observed in the trachea and bronchi after antigen challenge in animals passively sensitized with IgE-anti-DNP (+ 200% and + 153%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Challenge of sensitized animals with aerosolized ovalbumin was followed by early (2 h) and late-phase (17 h) bronchoconstriction. The induction of hypersensitivity, by aerosolized antigen, was associated with an increase in mucosal T cell numbers, which consisted almost entirely of CD8+ T cells. Following allergen challenge of fully sensitized animals, a biphasic rise in total T cell (CD3+) numbers was observed in the bronchial mucosa, peaking at 17 and 48 h. A similar pattern of T cell accumulation was observed in the bronchial adventitia but with an extra early peak at 2 h. In contrast to the T cell influx of the sensitization phase, the postchallenge infiltrate consisted largely of CD3+, CD8- cells. Eosinophil numbers were elevated in both submucosa and adventitia, with a single broad peak between 17 and 48 h. T cell infiltration was compared with eosinophil accumulation; while correlations between T cell and eosinophil numbers varied over the 96 h of the experiment, strong associations were observed between CD8+ numbers and eosinophils in the adventitia at 6 h (r = 0.733, p less than 0.01) and between CD3+ numbers and eosinophils in the submucosa at 72 h (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). No significant changes were detected in T cell or eosinophil numbers in the lung parenchyma.

The following groups were studied: uninoculated (n = 6, Control); inoculated with canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) (n = 11, Infected); and subclinical spontaneous infection with CAV2 (n = 6, Subclinical). While anesthetized with chloralose and mechanically ventilated, lung function and responsiveness to aerosolized histamine were measured 3 days before inoculation (Day -3), the day of inoculation (Day 0), and 3 to 4 (Day 3-4), 6 (Day 6), 8 to 10 (Day 8-10), and 12 to 14 (Day 12-14) days after inoculation. Histamine responsiveness was assessed by calculating the provocation concentration of histamine diphosphate to increase lung resistance (RL) to 150% (PC 150% RL), or decrease dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) to 75% (PC 75% Cdyn) of the response to saline [RL(sal) and Cdyn(sal), respectively]. Arterial blood gases, functional residual capacity (FRC), specific static lung compliance (spCst), RL, Cdyn, and histamine responsiveness were not significantly different on Day 0 among the groups (p greater than 0.05). Control and Subclinical puppies remained healthy, had a mean weight gain of 0.7 kg, and did not change their histamine responsiveness during the study period. Infected puppies developed moderate to severe clinical illnesses, had poor weight gain, and were histamine hyperresponsive on Days 3-4 and 6.

The following two series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that this phenomenon may be associated with the Ag-induced late-phase bronchoconstriction (LAR). In the first, two bronchoscopes wedged in airway segments of two contralateral lobes of 16 dogs were used to deliver 0.26, 2.6, or 26 micrograms of Ag to one lobe; the other served as a control. After the observation of a LAR, Ag and control lobes plus one unexposed tissue sample were collected and prepared for histologic examination. The data showed that the incidence, time of onset, and magnitude of the LAR were dose-related. In the second series of experiments, performed in 14 dogs, the tracheal mucosal surface was surgically exposed to allow 80 micrograms of beclomethasone dipropionate to be sprayed on one half while the other half was left untreated. Pledgets saturated with 0.2 microgram of Ag were placed on both sides 1 h later. Then two bronchoscopes were used to pretreat airways of two contralateral lobes to 40 micrograms of either the steroid or the vehicle. One hour later, both airways were exposed to 2.6 micrograms of aerosolized Ag. Of these 14 dogs monitored for peripheral airway responses, seven demonstrated a LAR in the vehicle-treated airway. In all seven dogs, the LAR was absent in the steroid-treated airway even though the cellular profiles of the two airways did not significantly differ. In seven additional dogs, the bronchoscopic procedure was performed as previously described. However, these dogs were killed 1 h after Ag exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They had their first LRI between birth and 7 yr of age (range, 5 to 11 yr). The cross-sectional area of the epithelium was quantified by point counting for the percentage area of intercellular spaces (ICS) denoting edema, and the numbers of both inflammatory cells (leukocytes, including eosinophils, and mast cells) and ciliated cells. The children (excluding the one using inhaled steroids) demonstrated nearly 17- and more than sevenfold increases in the mean area of ICS and number of inflammatory cells per epithelial area, respectively, and a nearly three-fold decrease in the mean number of ciliated cells per epithelial area compared with the biopsy specimens from the orifice of the right upper lobe bronchus of two healthy adults. In the children, the increase in inflammatory cells (greater than 91% were lymphocytes) was more prominent in the children with two LRI before the age of 1 yr. Our findings imply a close association of early LRI and later epithelial inflammation during chronic cough. Allergic mechanisms in the epithelial inflammation cannot be ruled out as six of the patients had, either alone or in combination, signs of atopia, positive family history of allergic rhinitis or asthma, and eosinophils or mast cells in the epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Interaction between lung fibroblasts and airway epithelial cells may play an important role in lung morphogenesis and airway repair after injury. Even though many reports have suggested that mesenchymal fibroblasts have a growth stimulatory effect on surrounding epithelial cells, very few have attempted to confirm and characterize the growth stimulatory activity in isolated cell systems. We cultured human fetal lung (HFL-1) fibroblasts, harvested supernatant-conditioned media under serum-free conditions, and examined their growth stimulatory effect on bovine bronchial epithelial cells by a variety of techniques, including direct enumeration, thymidine uptake, and metaphase arrest. We also partially characterized the growth stimulatory activity and examined the effect of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis on its release. The results demonstrate that HLF-1 fibroblasts release growth stimulatory activity for bovine bronchial epithelial cells. This activity is nondialyzable, protease-sensitive, acid-stable, and lipid-inextractable and thus appears to have the property of protein; it may be produced by de novo synthesis. Molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-75 indicates an approximate molecular mass of 6,000 D. This growth stimulatory activity is likely to play roles in lung morphogenesis and airway repair after injury.\r"

  ".W": "Increased pulmonary artery pressure is known to result in enhanced collagen deposition in the pulmonary artery. Here we investigate how changes in collagen metabolism may bring about this increased deposition in the pulmonary artery of animals with pulmonary hypertension induced by bleomycin. Rabbits were injected intratracheally with bleomycin sulfate or with saline. After 14 days the animals were injected with L-[U-14C]proline plus a \"flooding\" dose of unlabeled proline. Uptake into arterial collagens and release of labeled hydroxyproline were then measured after 2.5 h. The relative amounts of types I and III collagens were assessed from the levels of cyanogen-bromide-derived peptides alpha 1(I)CB8 and alpha 1(III)CB5, respectively, after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Collagen synthesis rates of about 3%/day were found in the control pulmonary artery and aorta, and about one-half of the newly synthesized collagen was degraded rapidly. Fourteen days after bleomycin, there was a fivefold increase in collagen synthesis rate (p less than 0.01) and a marked decrease in the percentage of newly synthesized collagen degraded rapidly. There was no change in collagen metabolism in the aorta of these animals. Pulmonary artery collagen from control rabbits consisted of 26.5 +/- 1.0% type III collagen. There was no change in composition in bleomycin-treated animals. This study demonstrates quite rapid turnover rates for collagen in normal blood vessels. Our results also indicate that remodeling of arterial connective tissue matrix during pulmonary hypertension involves marked but commensurate increases in type I and III collagens brought about by changes in both synthesis and degradative processes.\r"

  ".U": "90145849\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic pulmonary hypertension can develop in diseases associated with acute or repeated inflammation in the lungs, e.g., adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic bronchitis. Inflammation has also been associated with some animal models of chronic pulmonary hypertension. We have previously shown that 12 days of continuous air embolization into sheep results in the functional and structural changes of chronic pulmonary hypertension. To determine whether granulocytes contribute to these changes, five sheep were granulocyte-depleted with hydroxyurea immediately before and during air embolization (AIR-PMN) and were compared with sheep receiving air embolization (AIR only). Air embolization was discontinued briefly every 4 days for monitoring of pulmonary vascular pressures and assessment of pulmonary vasoreactivity to a bolus injection of PGH2-A. After 12 days of air embolization, the lungs were removed for structural studies. AIR-PMN sheep did not develop the sustained increase in pulmonary artery pressure seen in the AIR sheep (Day 12, AIR-PMN = 20 +/- 3 cm H2O; AIR = 29 +/- 2; mean +/- SE). Similarly, the increased pulmonary pressor response to PGH2-A seen in AIR sheep was not found in the AIR-PMN group. Structural studies of the barium-injected lungs of AIR-PMN sheep revealed a twofold increase in medial thickness of normally muscular arteries and a significant increase in the percent of muscular intraacinar arteries (similar to findings in lungs from AIR sheep). The number of barium-filled arteries was increased in AIR-PMN sheep when compared with that in AIR sheep, but the number was still less than in the control sheep. We conclude that granulocytes may contribute to the functional changes of chronic pulmonary hypertension after continuous air embolization in sheep, but they do not play a role in structural changes involving pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and their precursors. The present data also suggest that the reduction in peripheral arterial filling is the structural alteration that contributes most to the sustained rise in pulmonary artery pressure. The data further suggest that pulmonary hypertension after air embolization may have a vasoconstrictive component that is granulocyte-dependent.\r"

  ".W": "Male neonates develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with a greater incidence and mortality than do female neonates; the cause of this male disadvantage remains obscure. Male fetuses are exposed to higher levels of androgens and Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). Androgens have been shown to inhibit fetal lung maturation, and recent evidence in vitro indicates that MIS, a Sertoli cell-derived glycoprotein made early in ontogeny of the testis, may also inhibit lung development. To study whether this fetal regressor might inhibit maturation of the fetal lung in vivo, we injected human recombinant MIS (rMIS) into fetal rats, measured serum levels of rMIS using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and analyzed fetal lung tissue histologically and for protein, glycogen, DNA, and disaturated phosphatidylcholine content. Peak serum levels of recombinant MIS were measured at 6 h, with an apparent elimination half-life of 3 h, and without leakage into adjacent littermates injected with vehicle alone. Female fetal rat lung tissue exposed to recombinant MIS (10(-9) M, 10(-8) M) revealed depressed disaturated phosphatidylcholine content both 48 and 72 h after injection compared with female vehicle-injected littermates. Male lungs of the same gestational age appeared inhibited at a higher (10(-8) M) rMIS dose. These inhibitory effects observed in vivo confirm those previously seen in vitro and suggest that MIS, as well as androgens, may play a causative or important ancillary role in the sexual dimorphism that characterizes the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Malignant transformation of these lesions is a known complication. A case is reported of an adult patient with persistent juvenile laryngotracheobronchial papillomatosis who developed carcinoma in situ of the trachea and right upper lobe bronchus. He underwent experimental photodynamic therapy using dihematoporphyrin ether and rhodamine B dye laser. In addition, he received external beam radiation therapy. Bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of carcinoma in situ or recurrence of the underlying papillomas for a follow-up period of 24 months. This observation suggests that photodynamic therapy with dihematoporphyrin ether, either alone or in combination with radiation therapy, may have a role in the ablation of juvenile laryngotracheobronchial papillomatosis.\r"

Slit-lamp observations of postoperative anterior ocular inflammation were not different between treatment groups. Both ketorolac and dexamethasone solutions were well tolerated by patients. No additional corticosteroids were given to any patients during the study. Therefore, ketorolac solution was as effective as dexamethasone solution in suppressing postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery as measured by fluorophotometry and as observed by slit-lamp examinations. This study confirms prior studies that suggest ketorolac ophthalmic solution 0.5% may be effective and safe as a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent for topical use after cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation and as a substitute for topically applied corticosteroids.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate possible relationships between VOR and future susceptibility and habituation to seasickness. Thirty candidates for future maritime service were exposed to a series of yaw axis smooth harmonic accelerations before and after 6 months of regular sailing, and their VOR gain and phase responses were recorded. Seasickness severity was estimated after 1 and 6 months of service by a questionnaire. We conclude that VOR gain at 0.01 Hz may serve as a physiologic correlate helping to predict seasickness susceptibility, and that the increase in phase lead at 0.02 Hz may mark the habituation process to sea conditions.\r"

A highly significant difference (p less than .0001) was found between the two groups, the mean distance (+/- SD) among patients being 7.8 +/- 1.7 mm, while among controls it was 13.5 +/- 2.8 mm. Moreover, a significant positive correlation (p less than .001) was found within the pneumatized control group itself, between the sinus' distance and the degree of mastoid pneumatization. The results of this study may be interpreted by those who espouse environmental theories as denoting that infantile otitis media will determine the position of the lateral sinus. However, those who favor the genetic explanation may maintain that since the position of the sinus is established prenatally and involves organogenetically the shape of the skull, the final position is unlikely to be influenced by postnatal otitis media.\r"

A 2-month-old child presented with episodes of stridor and obstructive apnea due to a bronchogenic cyst compressing the trachea and causing near-total obstruction. Aspiration of the cyst during bronchoscopy resulted in severe bradycardia (from 140 to 50 beats per minute), although blood pressure was stable and oxygen saturation remained at 100%. Subsequent elective thoracotomy revealed the cyst to be intimately associated with the vagus nerve, and vagal stimulation may have caused the bradycardia. Bronchogenic cysts, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants and children undergoing direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for airway compromise. The endoscopic aspiration of cystic tracheal and bronchial lesions may not obviate the need for more definitive surgical treatment and, as this case demonstrates, is not free of potential hazard.\r"

The occurrence of cerebral ischemia in patients with hyponatremia, 17 (24%) of 70 patients, was significantly higher than in patients without hyponatremia, 17 (12%) of 138 patients (chi 2 = 4.028, p = 0.045). Cerebral ischemia was not more often fatal in hyponatremic patients than in patients without hyponatremia.

Following treatment with IgG to spinal cord homogenate, new myelin synthesis as measured by quantitative morphometry increased sixfold. Cells in areas of remyelination that incorporated [3H]thymidine did not express differentiation markers of macrophages, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes but were identified by electron microscopic autoradiography as progenitor glial cells.

In response to 7 to 12 days of round-the-clock intravenous infusions of levodopa, fluctuations in motor performance gradually diminished, ultimately by more than 40%. The beneficial effect persisted for about 6 days after withdrawal of continuous parenteral treatment and resumption of standard oral therapy. Clinical improvement was associated with changes in several pharmacological indices: Acute dose-response studies of intravenous levodopa showed a shift of the curve to the right in the immediate postinfusion phase compared to preinfusion studies; the therapeutic index improved significantly as patients demonstrated about 76% increased beneficial antiparkinsonian response with an equal degree of toxic dyskinetic effects; and the duration of action of levodopa was prolonged by 30%. These results suggest that changes in central dopaminergic mechanisms contributing to motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease can be modified by procedures that provide continuous dopamine replacement. Presumably these modifications underlie the gradual amelioration of motor fluctuations over several days of round-the-clock therapy. Results of the present study also suggest potential deleterious effects of chronic intermittent oral treatment in the development of motor complications and thus support the role of long-term, continuous administration of dopaminomimetics.\r"

Group 3 comprised genetically epilepsy-resistant rats (GERRs) who received audiogenic stimulations but had no seizures. After 3 weeks of stimulations the rats were tested for learning, memory, and behavior using the T-maze, water maze, open field activity test, home cage intruder test, and handling test. When compared with the control GEPRs and GERRs, Group 1 rats reached criteria less frequently in the T-maze, required longer times to find the platform in the water maze, and were less active in the open field activity test, less aggressive in the home cage intruder test, and more irritable and aggressive in the handling test. This study demonstrates that frequent, brief seizures in immature animals result in significant detrimental changes in learning, memory, activity level, and behavior.\r"

The maximum voluntary force of the first dorsal interosseous muscle was also measured. In patients, fastest voluntary contraction time (i.e., time from onset of contraction to peak force) was prolonged and inversely proportional to maximum voluntary force. Maximum rate of rise of tension (i.e., slope of rise in force) was reduced and directly proportional to maximum voluntary force. In patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I, contraction time was longer and the maximum rate of rise of tension was lower than in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type II. In patients and normal subjects, voluntary contraction time was closely correlated with the duration of electromyographic bursts. In patients, the twitch contraction time was prolonged and inversely proportional to maximum voluntary force. Twitch contraction amplitude was diminished and directly proportional to maximum voluntary force. Neither twitch contraction time nor amplitude were dependent on the type of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Twitch contraction time evoked by proximal nerve stimulation was minimally longer than that evoked by distal stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This decline in movement of the hindlimbs develops simultaneously with the appearance of mononuclear phagocytes in the gray matter of injured neural tissue. Chloroquine and colchicine inhibit phagocytic and secretory functions in mononuclear phagocytes. When given up to 6 hours after an induced ischemic lesion in rabbit, this drug combination decreased the number of mononuclear phagocytes found within the gray matter of damaged spinal cord, improved the recovery of function of the hindlimbs and bladder, preserved spinal somatosensory evoked potentials, and promoted the survival of motor neurons. In contrast, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, a weak inhibitor of mononuclear phagocytes in vivo, did not reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the spinal cord and did not improve motor and bladder functions. The suppression of mononuclear phagocytes soon after ischemic injury may offer a new approach in the treatment of vascular disease in the central nervous system.\r"

The RRHS and SE protocols induced significant neuronal loss in the CA1 region, but no evidence was found for additional cell loss with increasing numbers of intermittent seizures. These intermittent seizures were, however, associated with a significant thickening of the basal and apical dendritic fields of the CA1 region. These findings indicate that intermittent seizures produce no significant hippocampal neuronal loss and may result in a hypertrophy of CA1 dendritic fields.\r"

Single or a series of magnetic stimuli were applied to various regions of the skull. The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation were monitored via subdurally implanted electrodes. In the process of presurgical evaluation, the dosage of anticonvulsant medication had been reduced in all patients but one. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was able to activate the epileptic focus (or foci) in 12 of the 13 patients. Distinct patterns of focal activation were observed in 3 patients who had several foci. No epileptiform potentials were induced outside epileptic foci, which had been identified by corticographic recordings. In one patient a complex partial seizure that was induced was identical to her habitual seizures. In another patient, a complete transition from a nonactive theta focus to a self-sustained epileptic focus occurred. A facilitation of epileptiform afterdischarge was seen with sequential stimulation. No adverse effects were either reported by the patients or observed by the investigators. In summary transcranial magnetic stimulation is able to activate the epileptic focus (or foci) and consequently may be an additional tool for the localization of epileptic foci in presurgical evaluation.\r"

We prospectively studied neurological outcomes with serial magnetic resonance imaging in 13 hyponatremic subjects with serum sodium concentrations of less than 115 mmol/L (mean initial serum sodium concentration, 103.7; range, 93-113 mmol/L). All subjects were corrected to mildly hyponatremic levels at 24 hours and ultimately underwent an increase in serum sodium concentration of 25 mmol/L without development of hypernatremia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the development of pontine lesions in 3 patients. The correction rate of hyponatremia over the first 24 hours was significantly faster in patients with pontine lesions (mean +/- SD, 1.25 +/- 0.4 mmol/(L . hr) versus 0.74 +/- 0.3 mmol/(L . hr); p less than 0.05). Initial sodium concentration was also significantly lower in the pontine lesion group (97.3 +/- 6.7 vs 105.6 +/- 5.2 mmol/L, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the correction rate of hyponatremia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of pontine lesions in individuals with profound hyponatremia who undergo large increases in sodium concentration as a result of severe initial hyponatremia.\r"

Effects of intrathecal Dyn A-(1-17) were also compared to those of Dyn A-(2-17), which is inactive at opiate receptors, in uninjured and injured animals. Both Dyn A-(1-17) and Dyn A-(2-17) produced motor dysfunction in uninjured rats, but Dyn A-(1-17) was approximately 2.5 times more potent. At lower doses of Dyn A-(1-17), paraparesis was markedly attenuated by nor-BNI; nor-BNI was less effective at higher doses of Dyn A-(1-17) and did not modify the motor dysfunction produced by Dyn A-(2-17). Treatment with dynorphin antiserum significantly improved outcome after trauma as compared to control treatment with normal rabbit serum or leucine-enkephalin antiserum. Dyn A-(1-17), but not Dyn A-(2-17) at similar doses, exacerbated neurological dysfunction after spinal cord injury. Pretreatment with nor-BNI attenuated neurological dysfunction after traumatic spinal cord injury to a similar degree in rats administered saline or Dyn A-(1-17). These observations support the hypothesis that dynorphin contributes to certain pathophysiological changes after traumatic spinal cord injury through both opiate-receptor (kappa-receptor)-mediated and nonopioid mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Although the static encephalopathies of childhood are common, little is known of the underlying alterations in the neurochemical anatomy of the brain. Using quantitative morphological techniques, we examined the effect of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia on the number and distribution of cholinergic (ACh) neurons in a unilateral experimental striatal lesion in rats. The striatal pathology simulates status marmoratus, a recognized correlate of human dystonic cerebral palsy. We found that striatal injury results in a mean 22% decrease in the number of ACh neurons at the age of 3 to 4 weeks. The loss of neurons was relatively less than the volume loss, resulting in a mean 16% increase in neuron density. This effect was not uniform throughout the striatum; it was more pronounced caudally, resulting in a mean 52% increase in density in the most caudal striatal plane. These changes in immature rats were also seen in adult rats, indicating that there were lasting alterations in striatal cholinergic morphology. Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the striatum also resulted in a persistent decrease in the mean area of ACh neurons. The increased density of these neurons may imply that they are relatively resistant to hypoxic-ischemic injury. These findings may be relevant to the observation that anticholinergic drugs are among the most effective for treating dystonias, including those observed in static encephalopathies.\r"

The age-adjusted (to total 1980 US population) rate for women (5.9) was significantly higher than that for men (3.4). Annual incidence rates increased significantly with age in both women and men. Data based on evidence in the medical records suggest that trigeminal neuralgia is a rather rare and unpredictable disease: The number of episodes varies from 1 to 11, and length of episode from 1 day to 4 years. This study indicates an elevated relative risk associated with hypertension (both overall and among women in the cohort). Also, prevalence of multiple sclerosis was significantly greater among the group of 75 patients who had trigeminal neuralgia. Since the data on treatment in this study do not correspond to a randomized clinical trial, they are presented as empirical results only and show no single treatment of choice for trigeminal neuralgia.\r"

To determine whether spinal cord trauma alters the concentrations of extracellular amino acids, microdialysis was conducted in spinal cord during and after administration of impact trauma. Extracellular concentrations of excitatory, inhibitory, and nontransmitter amino acids were elevated after trauma, with the degree of increase related to severity of injury. Moderate trauma resulted in an immediate but transient increase (200-400%) in the extracellular levels of all amino acids measured. Severe trauma produced a more prolonged and significant increase (400-630%) in the concentrations of extracellular amino acids, including aspartate and glutamate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that excitatory amino acids may contribute to delayed tissue injury after central nervous system trauma.\r"

With the checkerboard technique the following combinations were tested: oxacillin-ofloxacin, oxacillin-temafloxacin, oxacillin-fleroxacin, vancomycin-fleroxacin, gentamicin-fleroxacin, and rifampin-fleroxacin. Against methicillin-resistant staphylococci the combination oxacillin-quinolone tested at 35 degrees C always showed a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of less than 0.75, which is interpreted as synergistic or additive. Equal or more synergistic effects were observed at 30 degrees C. In contrast, when methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus species were tested, the FIC for the combination oxacillin-quinolone was always 1 or 2, which is considered to be indifferent. For the other mentioned combinations the FICs were also 1 or 2. Killing kinetics showed synergistic or additive bactericidal activity for the combination oxacillin-ofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species, killing 1.5 to 2.8 log10 CFU more of these per ml than did the most active drug after 24 h of incubation. This difference was not observed for methicillin-susceptible strains. In vitro evidence for the potential clinical use of quinolones in treating infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci in combination with a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin is provided.\r"

Normal and immunocompromised guinea pigs were infected intravenously with Aspergillus fumigatus and treated orally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally with saperconazole or intraperitoneally with amphotericin B. Leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and monocytosis were obtained with mechlorethamine hydrochloride; leukopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia were obtained with cyclophosphamide. Saperconazole was dissolved for oral treatment in polyethylene glycol and for parenteral treatment in cyclodextrins. Amphotericin B was given parenterally as Fungizone (E.R. Squibb & Sons). Treatment was given once daily for 14 days. An early starting treatment was efficacious, but the activity of saperconazole was maintained even when the onset of the treatment was delayed to the moribund state. The activity of saperconazole was not altered in immunocompromised animals. Saperconazole was clearly superior to amphotericin B and free of side effects. The oral and parenteral formulations of saperconazole were equipotent. The systemic activity of saperconazole in guinea pigs was confirmed in invasive aspergillosis in pigeons.\r"

In plaque reduction assays, WIN 54954 reduced plaque formation of 50 of 52 rhinovirus serotypes (MICs ranged from 0.007 to 2.2 micrograms/ml). A concentration of 0.28 microgram/ml was effective in inhibiting 80% of the 52 serotypes tested (EC80). WIN 54954 was also effective in inhibiting 15 commonly isolated enteroviruses, with an EC80 of 0.06 microgram/ml. Furthermore, WIN 54954 was effective in reducing the yield of two selected enteroviruses in cell culture by 90% at concentrations approximately equal to their MICs. The therapeutic efficacy of intragastrically administered WIN 54954 was assessed in suckling mice infected with coxsackievirus A-9 or echovirus type 9 (Barty) 2.5 days prior to initiation of therapy. Single daily doses of 2 and 100 mg/kg protected 50% of the mice from developing paralysis (PD50) following infection with coxsackievirus A-9 and echovirus-9, respectively. At the PD50 doses for these two viruses, levels of WIN 54954 in serum were maintained above the in vitro MICs for a significant portion of the dosing interval. The dose-dependent reduction in viral titers observed in coxsackievirus A-9-infected mice correlated well with the therapeutic dose response. The potency and spectrum of WIN 54954 make it a potentially useful compound for the treatment of human enterovirus and rhinovirus infections.\r"

In terms of its MICs in susceptibility testing, mainly done by using Sabouraud dextrose agar plates, piritetrate exhibited several- to 10-fold-stronger antidermatophytic activity than tolnaftate, a reference thiocarbamate. Furthermore, piritetrate was found to show a broader antifungal spectrum than tolnaftate; relatively many species and strains of dematiaceous fungi, dimorphic fungi, and some other filamentous fungi as well as a few strains of Cryptococcus neoformans were fairly susceptible to piritetrate, while almost all the tested species and strains were resistant to tolnaftate. All the tested species of the genus Candida were, however, resistant to both compounds. Variables which can influence antimicrobial activity caused few changes in the MICs of either compound against Trichophyton mentagrophytes; however, an increase in the inoculum size resulted in a significant increase in the MICs. The antidermatophytic activities of piritetrate and tolnaftate were fungistatic but not fungicidal. Piritetrate also exhibited a more potent in vitro anti-T. mentagrophytes activity than clotrimazole or tolciclate. Piritetrate and tolnaftate had no antibacterial activity. The in vivo activity of topically administered piritetrate against experimental dermal infection of guinea pigs with T. mentagrophytes was more effective than that of tolnaftate both mycologically and clinically. Piritetrate manifested no acute toxicity in laboratory animals when administered even in large quantities by the oral, intraperitoneal, and topical routes.\r"

Combined therapy on day 3 of a BZV infection protected over 75% of mice showing clinical evidence of viral disease before treatment. Protection against early brain infection must occur on day 4 p.i., since by that day BZV has started multiplying in the brains of the mice. Significant protection occurred with antiserum alone and increased with poly(ICLC).

Broth macrodilution susceptibility testing was performed with buffered yeast extract broth and two Legionella pneumophila strains. Antimicrobial inhibition of L. pneumophila growth in guinea pig alveolar macrophages was also studied, using a method able to detect bacterial killing. The MICs for 90% of the 21 strains of Legionella spp. grown on buffered charcoal yeast extract medium were 0.125 microgram/ml for WIN 57273, 0.25 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 1.0 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. These MICs were falsely high, because of inhibition of drug activity by the medium used. Use of less drug-antagonistic, starch-containing media did not support good growth of the test strains. The broth macrodilution MICs for two strains of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 were less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml for WIN 57273 and ciprofloxacin and 0.125 microgram/ml for erythromycin.

However, a combination of mechanical and microbiological factors may be involved, with follicular occlusion leading to yeast overgrowth and folliculitis. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate this hypothesis. Skin biopsy specimens obtained from patients with Pityrosporum folliculitis were examined by scanning electron microscopy before and after oral ketoconazole therapy. Patients with active disease showed occlusion of noninflamed follicles, which resolved after ketoconazole treatment. Follicular occlusion was not present in biopsy specimens obtained from unaffected controls nor was it related to the presence of P orbiculare. These findings suggest that follicular occlusion may be a primary event in the development of this folliculitis, with yeast overgrowth a secondary occurrence. The beneficial effect of ketoconazole in this disease may be due to direct effects on the follicle.\r"

  ".W": "Since its initial description, microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) of the skin has been controversial. In particular, it features keratin production of the type seen in some pilar neoplasms , and has been thought to pursue partial follicular differentiation. Diagnostically, MAC may be difficult to separate from desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (DTE) in superficial biopsy specimens. We studied 12 MACs, 22 malignant eccrine acrospiromas, 7 sudoriferous syringometaplasias, 6 syringomas, 5 DTEs, and 40 other benign pilar neoplasms immunohistochemically. Paraffin sections and antibodies to \"hard\" (pilar) keratins. epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Leu-M1, and S100 protein were employed. The MACs exhibited reactivity for hard keratin subclasses AE 13 and AE 14, EMA, CEA, and Leu-M1. Desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas expressed positivity for AE 14, EMA, and Leu-M1 focally, but lacked the other specified markers. Syringomas and malignant acrospiromas displayed EMA, CEA, and AE 14 reactivity, and 5 syringometaplastic lesions were AE 14-reactive. Benign pilar tumors aside from DTEs were reactive only for AE 13, AE 14, or both. These data indicate that MAC exhibits an immunophenotype that is a \"hybrid\" of those seen in pure sweat glandular and follicular neoplasms, and suggest that it may indeed show combined pilar and sudoriferous differentiation. Based on these results, it also appears that immunohistochemical analysis may be useful in the diagnostic separation of MAC and DTE.\r"

The major neurological and endocrine associations are well established, but those factors that predispose to the development of optic nerve hypoplasia remain unclear. To understand the aetiology of these problems better, and to formulate a management regime, we studied a consecutive series of 40 patients who were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 24) had severe bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia; group 2 (n = 10) had mild, bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia; and group 3 (n = 6) had unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia. Previously described aetiological factors (for example, low maternal age or maternal alcohol or drug ingestion) were not present in any of the groups; this removes the need to screen a specific population. It is important that careful neurological and developmental assessments are carried out in children with optic nerve hypoplasia to identify potential disease. The role of imaging is discussed.\r"

The syndrome affects the central and peripheral nervous system, and also the retina, liver, bone, adipose tissue, and genital organs. Abnormalities of glycoproteins, glycopeptide hormones, and lipids have been found in serum from these patients, the most pronounced being increased cathodal forms of transferrin. Isoforms of serum transferrin were therefore analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by isoelectric focusing and isocratic anion exchange chromatography, and the carbohydrate composition was determined in transferrin isolated by immune affinity chromatography. All the patients had about tenfold raised serum concentrations of isotransferrins with higher isoelectric points than normal. Similar findings, though less pronounced, were made in all the fathers and in one of the mothers. Half the transferrin in the patients was constantly present in two principal abnormal cathodal forms in approximately equal amounts. Carbohydrate determinations in purified transferrin showed quantitatively similar deficiencies of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine, the mannose content being normal. The results suggest that either two or all of the normally four terminal trisaccharides in transferrin may be missing. A defect in the synthesis or catabolism, or both, of this trisaccharide, which is common to many secretory glyco-conjugates, is likely. Apart from providing a quantitative diagnostic method, the present findings may serve as a basis for further studies of the metabolic deficiency in this syndrome.\r"

Height and weight recordings were analysed over a mean period of 9.2 years with a mean duration from HIV seroconversion of 4.5 years (range 2 to 6 years). Height standard deviation scores and ratio of weight to 50th centile for chronological age were calculated. No significant change in growth pattern as judged by height and weight has been observed within this group of boys after HIV seroconversion.

After adjusting for the effects of other variables known to be associated with height, it was shown that there was a weak negative association between sleep duration and height.

In patients successfully decannulated the median period of tracheostomy was 104 days (range 3 days to 9.0 years) and in 25 patients the tracheostomy is still in situ. Eighty four patients (60%) were discharged from hospital with their tracheostomy in situ and no patient was kept in hospital because of a tracheostomy beyond four weeks. There were two tracheostomy related deaths in hospital. Both patients had severe acquired subglottic stenosis secondary to ventilation for lung disease of prematurity. There were no tracheostomy related deaths at home; complications included tracheal granulomas and polyps (n = 19). After removal of the tracheostomy 13 children had a fistula requiring surgical closure and four required revision of the tracheostomy scar. Tracheostomy is well tolerated in small children, with few complications and can be managed safely in the home by the family.\r"

  ".W": "All patients with supraventricular tachycardia during the first 12 months of life who presented between 1977 and 1988 were identified by a retrospective survey of records in this hospital and by a questionnaire sent to paediatricians in the Northern region. Twenty two of 29 patients (76%) were in heart failure and seven (24%) had cardiogenic shock. Seven patients (24%) were free of symptoms. All had narrow QRS tachycardia at 215-315 beats/minute (mean (SD) 292 (21)). Initial treatment included digoxin (effective in seven of 14 patients, with overdose in three), verapamil (effective in three of three but fatal in one), cardioversion (effective in all 10 who were treated in this way), iced water applied to the face (effective in all 16 patients on 53 of 59 occasions, 90%). Initial treatment in local hospitals was less effective and associated with more complications than that given in the regional referral centre. Digoxin is often ineffective, return to sinus rhythm is delayed, and overdosing is common. Cardioversion is effective but tachycardia often recurs. Iced water is safe and effective, and should become the treatment of choice for termination of supraventricular tachycardia in neonates and young infants.\r"

One school was in an underprivileged urban locality in the area of increased incidence of heart disease ('high risk') and the other in a semi-rural affluent locality with an incidence of heart disease similar to the national average ('low risk'). Smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, physical fitness, and inactivity were evaluated as risk factors for coronary heart disease. Smoking, increased body fat, poor diet, and physical inactivity were found increased among pupils from the school in the high risk area compared with those in the low risk area. Lipids, maximum oxygen uptake, and hypertension were similar in both schools. The risk of coronary heart disease seems to reflect the adult mortality rates in the area. To reduce the overall incidence of coronary heart disease, health education should be directed towards prevention of smoking, improving diets, and increasing amounts of activity among school children, with special attention directed toward children in regions where there is a high mortality from coronary heart disease among adults.\r"

Being slow to feed, refusing meals, coughing or choking during eating, and vomiting at meal times were significantly more common than in 50 healthy control children. Anthropometric analysis indicated that almost one third of patients were growth retarded, although those with a primary oesophageal anastomosis were less likely to be stunted or wasted compared with children who had an oesophageal substitution preceded by an oesophagostomy. Feeding problems tended to resolve spontaneously but slowly, with half of all children still reporting some difficulties at 7 years of age. Parents were considerably worried by feed related symptoms and families benefited from mutual support. There is a need for additional help and advice to be provided both by hospital staff interested in nutrition and feeding disorders and those professionals involved with primary care.\r"

There was no significant difference between the groups expressing the results as total microU/specimen and so they have been combined to provide a prepubertal reference range of 2.25-10.50 microU/night. Prepubertal children with growth hormone deficiency who had not been receiving growth hormone treatment for two days had overnight urinary growth hormone concentrations well below this range. Urinary growth hormone was assayed in 49 children undergoing investigation for short stature with conventional provocative testing, and those shown to have growth hormone deficiency had correspondingly low overnight urinary growth hormone concentrations. There was, in addition, a strong correlation between overnight urinary growth hormone concentrations and peak serum response to provocation. This simple urine assay may provide a useful screening test for growth hormone deficiency.\r"

The steatocrit method proved unreliable in our hands and gave little indication of the presence or severity of steatorrhoea. The more simple microscopy method was highly sensitive (97%) and only three of 80 patients with steatorrhoea were missed. All patients with severe steatorrhoea (greater than 60 mmol fat/day) were clearly demonstrated. The method is applicable to spot faecal samples and can readily be carried out on an outpatient basis. In centres where faecal fat assays are not available, the simple and cheap microscopic examination will give some indication of the response to enzyme treatment and may also help to identify non-compliant individuals.\r"

A significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in serum gastrin concentration was detectable within 2.5 minutes after truncal vagotomy, and by 120 minutes serum gastrin has decreased to 15 +/- 1 pg/mL in the vagotomy group compared to 28 +/- 3 pg/mL in the control group (p less than 0.001). However by 24 hours after vagotomy, when maximal acid output was reduced by approximately 50%, fasting serum gastrin had increased nearly twofold above control levels in the vagotomy group (p = 0.06) and this increase persisted at day 7 (p less than 0.05). Thus truncal vagotomy had a biphasic effect on serum gastrin concentrations in dogs (acute inhibition followed by stimulation). While the mechanism for the acute fall in gastrin is probably an acute denervation of postganglionic neurons that innervate gastrin cells, the mechanism for the subsequent rise in serum gastrin remains uncertain.\r"

Ninety of these patients were more than 64 years old and are the subject of this review. The 30-day operative mortality rate for all patients undergoing hepatic resection was 3.3%: major hepatic resection was 4.4% and subsegmental resection was 1.4%. The operative mortality rate for patients undergoing major hepatic resection increased incrementally with age: for patients up to age 55 years it was 0.70%, for those between 55 and 64 years it was 3.6%, and for patients older than 64 years it increased to 11.1%. This higher operative mortality rate in the elderly reflects the mortality rate for extended right hepatic lobectomy in this age group of 30.7%. If this procedure is excluded, the operative mortality rate for patients older than age 64 was 7.6%. Sixty per cent of the operative deaths were due to hepatic insufficiency. The data presented demonstrate that major hepatic resection can be performed in the elderly with a low but somewhat increased mortality risk. However, because of its markedly increased operative risk, extended right hepatic lobectomy should be performed in elderly patients only in selected cases until better methods of estimating hepatic reserve are available.\r"

This is a very sad situation because in most experienced centers, liver replacement can offer a long-term hope of survival of more than 70% in a growing variety of pediatric liver disorders. The reported experience with 54 reduced-size grafts on a total of 141 transplants performed in 117 children between 1984 and 1988 demonstrates that the technique of reduced-size liver transplantation not only allows long-term survival but, in fact, offers the same survival hope with the same quality of liver function, regardless of the child's age and clinical condition. The prominent feature of our experience with the reduced liver concerns its deliberate use for elective cases. Seventy-seven per cent of the 30 children who electively received a reduced liver were alive 1 year after transplantation, as were 85% of the 62 children who received a full-size graft. There is no difference in the long-term survival rate of patients who received elective grafts, which is in the range of 75% with both techniques.\r"

Short-gut control animals (n = 8) who had no transplant died of malabsorption on day 62.5 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- SEM). Without cyclosporine immunosuppression, recipients (n = 5) of 3 m to 4 m jejunal allografts died of rejection on day 8.8 +/- 0.7. However enterectomized pigs (n = 11) who had segmental jejunal allograft transplants and were treated with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day) demonstrated significantly prolonged survival (to day 80.9 +/- 22.3; p less than 0.05). By 180 days after transplant, surviving animals increased their weight by almost 40%. In conclusion short-segment jejunal allografts significantly improved the mortality and morbidity rates from surgically created short bowel syndrome in pigs.\r"

Mechanism of injury, anatomic location, involvement of single or multiple sites, presence of ascites, elevations in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), and hypoalbuminemia were tabulated for each patient. Contingency tables were created for injury and hepatic parameters, as related to survival, and subjected to chi square analysis. Loglinear analysis was performed on all significant parameters to evaluate the independent effects of injury characteristics and hepatic insufficiency on survival. Predicted survival was 93%; observed survival was 70% (Z = -6.92; p less than 0.001). Cause of death was multiple-system organ failure (9) and closed head injury (3). Admission markers of poor outcome included one or more of the following: ascites, elevated PT or bilirubin, history of motor vehicle accident, multiple trauma, or blunt abdominal trauma requiring laparotomy. Loglinear analysis revealed that the presence of ascites, elevated PT, or bilirubin, further diminished the rate of survival for any individual injury characteristic. We concluded that survival among cirrhotic trauma victims was significantly lower than predicted. In addition the presence of hepatic insufficiency further diminishes survival, regardless of the injury sustained.\r"

  ".W": "Hindlimb ischemia and reperfusion results in local limb and distant lung injury. This study tests whether the mechanism of injury is by ischemia mediated polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and diapedesis. Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to three hours of hindlimb ischemia (n = 8) or sham ischemia (n = 4). PMN derived solely from the reperfused ischemic limb and assayed flow cytometrically displayed an oxidative burst of 135 /- 8 fentamoles dichlorofluorescein (fmDCF)/cell compared to preischemc levels of 74 +/- 14 fmDCF/cell (p less than 0.05). Additional aliquots of isolated neutrophils were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 10(-7) M. In contrast to a 162% increase in oxidative burst before ischemia, neutrophils at ten minutes of reperfusion had an enhanced response to PMA of 336% (p less than 0.05). Plasma collected from the ischemic hindlimb at ten minutes of reperfusion when introduced into an abraded skin chamber or intratracheally induced diapedesis in nonischemic animals. PMN accumulations in the skin chamber were 1636 +/- 258 PMN/mm3 after three hours (n = 8) compared to 63 +/- 18 PMN/mm3 induced by sham plasma (n = 4, p less than 0.05). Introduction of ischemic plasma intratracheally into a lobar bronchus (n = 4) induced PMN accumulations after three hours, measured by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 19 +/- 2 X 10(4) PMN/mm3 compared to 5 +/- 1 X 10(4) PMN/mm3 with sham plasma (n = 4, p less than 0.05). Diapedesis was completely prevented (0-3 PMN/mm3, p less than 0.05) by introducing ischemic plasma into skin chambers in animals whose hindlimbs had been made ischemic (n = 6) or into chambers located on skin regions that had been previously made ischemic (n = 6). Similarly after hindlimb ischemia, lavage of the lung with ischemic plasma yielded few PMN 0-3/mm3 (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that ischemia and reperfusion lead to generation of a circulating component in plasma that causes an oxidative burst in PMN and inhibits their diapedesis but promotes diapedesis when applied extravascularly to a naive animal.\r"

In non-tumor-bearing CBA/J mice (n = 60), 1% arginine supplementation significantly enhanced thymic weight, spleen cell mitogenesis, and interferon-activated natural killer cell activity; no further enhancement was observed with 2% or 4% supplementation. Supplemental 1% arginine, when compared with 1.7% glycine, enhanced interferon-induced natural killer cell activity, lymphokine-activated killer cell generation, and macrophage cytotoxicity. In A/J mice (n = 420), bearing either a moderately immunogenic (C1300) or weakly immunogenic (TBJ) murine neuroblastoma, 1% arginine significantly (p less than 0.05) retarded tumor growth and prolonged median survival time compared with glycine or no supplementation. Dietary arginine enhanced T-cell function and significantly increased responsiveness to autologous C1300 tumor in a mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC). The immunomodulatory effects of arginine provide nutritional and immunologic support of the tumor-bearing host and may be helpful when given concommitant with immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness and associated problems of emergency intubation in 605 injured infants and children admitted to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in 1987. We identified 63 patients (10.4%) undergoing endotracheal intubation at the scene of injury, at a referring hospital or in our emergency department. Injuries were to the head (90.5%), abdomen (12.7%), face (11.1%), chest (6.3%), neck (3.2%); or were orthopedic (19%) or multiple (39.7%). Indications for intubation included coma (74.6%), shock (28.6%), apnea (22.2%), and airway obstruction (3.2%). Of 16 complications (25.4%), 13 were immediately life threatening: right mainstem intubation (5), massive barotrauma (2), failure of adequate preoxygenation (2), esophageal intubation (1), attempt at nasotracheal intubation in an open facial fracture (1), and extubation during transport (1). Three were late complications: vocal cord paresis (2) and subglottic stenosis (1). Airway complications led to PO2 less than 90 mm Hg in 7 of 12 on first ABG, compared to 9 of 44 in uncomplicated cases (p less than 0.05). Intubation attempts at the scene of injury were more often multiple, unsuccessful, and associated with airway complications. All four complication-associated fatalities were life-threatening scene complications. Nearly one half (44.4%, 28 of 63) had one of the following problems in respiratory management: major airway complication, PaO2 less than 90, or PaCO2 greater than 45 on either the first or second ABG after arrival at our emergency department. Head injury with coma is the most common setting for emergency intubation. Airway complications are common, and are more frequent in treatment attempt at the scene. Despite endotracheal intubation, injured children in our series remain at high risk for hypoxemia, elevated arterial PCO2, and major airway complications, all of which contribute to secondary brain injury.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, manometric trial of anal fissure treated by subcutaneous lateral internal sphincterotomy (SLIS) was designed to elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition. Anorectal manometry with a closed, precalibrated, water-filled microballoon using the station pull-through technique was performed on 13 patients with anal fissure before, and at one and 150 days after SLIS. The results were compared with 13 control subjects, matched for age and sex, who had no history of anal disease. Both resting pressure (RP) and maximum voluntary contraction pressure (MVCP) were measured at centimeter intervals of the anal canal. At all levels RP was significantly higher in the preoperative patients compared with controls (p less than 0.0001). After operation RP fell significantly at all levels with the result that there was no significant difference in RP between postoperative patients and controls, except at 4 cm from the anal verge, where there remained a significant elevation in RP in the postoperative group. There was no significant difference in the two sets of postoperative manometric results. All patients underwent rapid healing and resolution of their symptoms. MVCP did not change significantly after operation, nor did it differ from the control values. This suggests that the increase in RP is due to activity of the internal anal sphincter. This over-activity is present throughout the entire length of the internal anal sphincter and sphincterotomy of its lowest portion returns RP to normal values throughout most of the anal canal.\r"

The bile acids (BA) present in the gastric juice were quantified by thin-layer chromatography and spectrofluorometry. The mean BA concentration for controls was 2.25 mumol reflux/hour, for 15 asymptomatic patients 47.94 and for 15 patients with symptoms of PARG 125.79. After biliary diversion by a Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the latter, their BA in 13 of these patients after surgery, and relapsed in only one during a 4-year follow-up. The remaining two patients had the lowest preoperative BA levels in this group. These results indicate that EGR is increased after gastric surgery more markedly indicated that EGR is increased after gastric surgery more markedly in patients with symptoms of PARG, and that patients who have high levels of EGR (more than 80 mumol BA reflux/hour) clearly benefit from biliary diversion.\r"

We sought to determine whether triazolam, an agent with a short half-life, was used preferentially in older patients (age greater than or equal to 70 years). We also wanted to determine whether dosages of triazolam or flurazepam were lowered in elderly patients. Our findings showed that prescriber level of training was a much stronger determinant of drug choice than patient age. Attending physicians prescribed flurazepam twice as often as interns. Lower dosages of both agents were prescribed more frequently to older patients. Our data suggest that some physicians choose a benzodiazepine hypnotic out of habit rather than application of pharmacologic principles, but reduce doses appropriately when prescribing to elderly patients.\r"

After measurement of electrolytes in (1) serum from 29 healthy volunteers, (2) aqueous standards verified against National Bureau of Standards reference material, and (3) serum from 120 blood donors, we drew the following conclusions. (1) The reference range for the anion gap has shifted downward (to 3 to 11 mmol/L in one of our laboratories), primarily because of an upward shift in chloride values. (2) Using the ASTRA analyzer, a majority of normal individuals can be expected to have serum anion gaps of 6 mmol/L or less unless chloride calibration is deliberately altered. (3) If the anion gap is to remain an effective tool in diagnosing acid-base disorders, clinicians need to be aware that the traditional reference range may not be appropriate with new instrumentation.\r"

The mean interval from blood culture inoculation to growth was 28 days. Acid-fast organisms or granulomas were seen in four bone marrow and six liver specimens. Liver biopsy revealed acid-fast bacilli in a higher percentage of cases (75%) than did bone marrow biopsy (25%). Mycobacterial blood culture is a relatively slow method that occasionally fails to diagnose mycobacterial infection. In febrile patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, liver biopsy is the most rapid method of diagnosing mycobacterial infection.\r"
