  ".W": "Wider application of positron emission tomography would be facilitated by the availability of positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals labeled with nuclides, like 62Cu, that are available from parent/daughter generator systems. Using a longer-lived copper isotope (67Cu) we have examined three derivatives of copper(II) pyruvaldehyde bis(thiosemicarbazone) as potential tracers for evaluation of cerebral and myocardial blood flow: Cu(PTS), Cu(PTSM), and Cu(PTSM2) (where PTS = pyruvaldehyde bis(thiosemicarbazone), PTSM = pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone), and PTSM2 = pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-dimethylthiosemicarbazone). All three lipophilic radiocopper complexes were obtained in high yield via a procedure that could be adapted to a \"kit\" formulation. In animal model systems Cu(PTSM) and Cu(PTSM2) show excellent uptake in the brain and heart following i.v. injection. These tracers differ in that Cu(PTSM) exhibits microsphere-like retention in the brain and heart, whereas Cu(PTSM2) substantially clears from these organs. The relative cerebral pharmacokinetics of [67Cu]Cu(PTSM) and [67Cu]Cu(PTSM2) are consistent with their known reactivity towards intracellular sulfhydryl groups.\r"

  ".W": "A method is presented for obtaining accurate positron emission tomography transmission measurements after tracer injection. A transmission scan is performed using a rotating source immediately before or after a conventional emission scan. Sinogram windowing, which removes most scattered and random coincidences, also removes most of the emission counts contaminating the transmission measurement. Data from the emission scan can be used to subtract the remaining emission counts to produce accurate transmission measurements. For studies with moderate to low emission count rates (e.g., fluorodeoxyglucose) there is little increase in noise in the resulting attenuation correction factors. This method was tested in experiments with phantoms and a rotating source simulator and validated against conventional ring transmission measurements. Applications of the technique can significantly shorten the time between transmission and emission studies, and thereby reduce the likelihood of patient motion and increase scanning throughput.\r"

  ".W": "Human T-cell populations specifically cytotoxic for autologous melanoma cells have been successfully generated from lymph node cells obtained from seven consecutive patients. The lymph node cells were stimulated in vitro with autologous irradiated melanoma cells; stimulation was repeated every 10-15 days at a tumor cell-to-lymphocyte ratio of approximately 1:20. Cytotoxic activity was assessed by a 4-hour 51Cr release assay. Mean lysis of autologous tumor cells was 47% at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 20:1, while mean lyses of the human myeloid leukemia cell line K562, allogeneic melanoma cells, and an osteosarcoma cell were 20%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. There was no lysis of autologous fibroblasts, fresh lymphocytes, or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blasts. Three grades of specificity developed sequentially. In grade I, lysis of autologous tumor cells exceeded lysis of allogeneic tumor cells but did not exceed lysis of K562 cells. In grade II, lysis of autologous tumor cells exceeded lysis of K562 cells and all allogeneic tumor cells tested. In grade III, potent lysis of autologous tumor cells (greater than 40%) exceeded lysis of K562 cells and of all allogeneic tumor cells tested. All seven lymphocyte populations reached or exceeded grade I. Six reached or exceeded grade II. Two progressed to grade III. The generated cells were T cells, as determined by phenotypic analysis with flow cytometry. CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells accounted for 83%-100% of the cells. CD8+ T cells were separated from CD4+ T cells by panning with OKT8 and OKT4 antibodies. The resulting CD8-enriched and CD4-enriched populations were compared as effectors in cytotoxicity assays. The results suggest that the cell responsible for lysis of autologous tumor cells is CD8+. The methods used in this study have repeatedly resulted in the successful generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specifically cytotoxic for autologous melanoma cells; it is suggested that these cells have potential application for adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.\r"

Syngeneic fibrosarcoma or melanoma cells were injected into the internal carotid arteries of mice. Several weeks later, once the experimental brain metastases were established, the mice were given injections iv of sodium fluorescein. The capillaries within the metastatic foci were enlarged and irregular, but there was no leakage of sodium fluorescein, showing that the blood-brain barrier was intact. The neoplastic lesions were infiltrated by mononuclear phagocytes, which were identified by immunohistochemical localization of the macrophage-specific antigen F4/80, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, and the macrophage product interleukin-1 (IL-1). The metastatic foci contained numerous stellate macrophages that expressed F4/80 and MHC class II antigens, but little IL-1. Round, monocyte-like F4/80 and MHC class II-positive cells were also observed within the tumor lesions and adhering to walls of the tumor microvasculature. Mice with fibrosarcoma brain metastases also had edematous lesions at sites remote from the metastatic foci that contained numerous astrocytes expressing class II MHC but not F4/80 antigens. In conclusion, the blood-brain barrier is intact within experimental brain metastases, yet macrophages of blood monocyte origin can infiltrate the lesions.\r"

Human NC cell activity was detected in freshly isolated PBLs and was augmented by short in vitro pulses with recombinant human interleukin-2 but not with recombinant human alfa interferon. Monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies inhibited the killing of the target cells. The independence of interferon and the mediation of killing by TNF distinguish human NC cell activity from natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of antiepidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 528 and 225 and a 528-ricin A conjugate on the growth of normal and malignant human cells were tested in vitro. Malignant human cell lines with EGF receptor numbers ranging from 0 to 4 X 10(5) receptors/cell, human fetal fibroblasts, and normal marrow granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-gm) showed no effect when grown with 10(-12) M to 10(-7) M MAb 225 or 528. MAbs 225 and 528 and EGF also had no effect on the ability of marrow stromal cells to maintain CFU-gm viability in long-term marrow cultures. Reversible growth inhibition of A431 epidermoid and MDA-468 breast carcinoma cells with 2 and 3 X 10(6) EGF receptors/cell, respectively, was observed with both antibodies and with 10(-8) M EGF. In contrast, an immunoconjugate prepared with MAb 528 and recombinant ricin A chain (528-rRA) showed dose-dependent killing over a concentration range of 10(-12) M to 10(-8) M against cells with greater than or equal to 1.2 X 10(5) EGF receptors/cell [concentration that causes 50% inhibition of growth (IC50) values, approximately 10(-12) M to 10(-10) M]. Human fetal fibroblasts (5.6 X 10(4) EGF receptors/cell), melanoma cells without detectable EGF receptors, and human CFU-gm showed IC50 values of greater than 10(-8) M. Killing of KB epidermoid carcinoma cells and 547 ovarian carcinoma cells with 4 and 1.2 X 10(5) EGF receptors/cell by 10(-10) or 10(-11) M 528-rRA was time dependent, but cytotoxicity to 547 cells was not complete even with 48 hours of immunotoxin treatment. Cytotoxicity of 528-rRA was not enhanced by chloroquine or verapamil. In vitro, anti-EGF receptor MAbs cause reversible antiproliferative effects only against malignant cell lines with amplified EGF receptor expression. In contrast, 528-rRA shows potent, specific toxicity to cells with greater than 50,000 EGF receptors/cell. However, kinetics of cell killing with 528-rRA are protracted, suggesting that prolonged exposure may be required for in vivo antitumor effects.\r"

We have investigated further the mechanism(s) of this in vivo antitumor activity. Our results indicate that following iv injection, the DXR-MAb 9.2.27 conjugate is cleared from the circulation with typical biphasic kinetics, similar to the clearance process of the unconjugated MAb 9.2.27. In contrast, less than 10% of injected dose per milliliter of blood is found in the circulation at any given time after ip injection. Toxicity studies further indicate that DXR-MAb 9.2.27 conjugate is less toxic in vivo than the freely administered DXR, which is known to cause considerable cardiotoxic effects. Direct autoradiography demonstrates that the DXR-MAb 9.2.27 conjugate binds specifically to the tissue sections derived from a human melanoma xenograft of a nude mouse. A critical evaluation is given of the relevance of these findings and their impact on the design of future strategies for the immunochemotherapy of malignant melanoma.\r"

Although hepatocytes are known to be the major source of plasma fibronectin, the stimulus controlling its production is not known. The present study investigated the role of interleukin-1 (Il-1) and LPS-induced monocyte supernatants in stimulating hepatocyte fibronectin synthesis in vitro. Hepatocytes exposed to monocyte supernatants significantly increased their production of fibronectin and fibrinogen. Albumin production was suppressed. Both LPS-induced and noninduced monocyte supernatants increased hepatocyte fibronectin and fibrinogen synthesis, and decreased albumin synthesis. However, only LPS-induced monocyte supernatants contained Il-1 activity. Pure Il-1 had no effect on hepatocyte fibronectin synthesis. Molecular sizing of the monocyte supernatants containing the Fibronectin Stimulating Factor (FSF) yielded active fractions in the 30-40 kD range. These fractions did not contain Il-1 activity. We conclude that a non-Il-1 monokine, Fibronectin Stimulating Factor (FSF), stimulates hepatocyte production of fibronectin. FSF is presumably the monokine responsible for stimulating hepatocyte fibronectin production in vivo following injury and during inflammation. Based on these results, and the time-course of fibronectin levels seen following injury and during inflammation, it seems reasonable to consider fibronectin as one of the acute-phase proteins.\r"

A median of 19 months (range, 7 to 120) after the initial diagnosis, 24 of these patients (6.8 percent) had elevated concentrations of other hormones in association with new clinical symptoms. In 13 of these patients (8 with glucagonomas, 3 with tumors secreting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and 2 with insulinomas), hypergastrinemia developed along with the clinical features of a gastrinoma; 5 patients died of gastrointestinal perforation or bleeding, apparently caused by this second tumor. We conclude that patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors, regardless of their initial clinical picture, require continued surveillance for new elevations of hormones.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate recent immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) as a possible risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), we studied the rates of SIDS after the administration of DTP vaccine in a cohort of 129,834 children who were born in four urban Tennessee counties during the period from 1974 through 1984. All the children received at least one DTP immunization in the first year of life at county health-department clinics or from Medicaid providers. Computerized immunization records from these sources were linked with Tennessee birth and death certificates to establish the cohort, ascertain the timing of immunization, and identify cases of SIDS. These children represented 42 percent of the births in the four counties. Among these children, 204 deaths occurred at the ages of 29 to 365 days; 109 deaths were classified as due to SIDS. We estimated the risk of SIDS according to the length of time, up to 30 days, since DTP immunization and compared it with the risk 31 days or more after immunization to calculate the relative risk. With control for age, the relative risk from 0 to 3 days after DTP immunization was 0.18 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.8); from 4 to 7 days, 0.17 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.7); from 8 to 14 days, 0.75 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 1.5); and from 15 to 30 days, 1.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.6). A multivariate analysis in which we controlled for age, sex, race, year, birth weight, and Medicaid enrollment, produced similar results. We conclude that in this large population of children there was no increase in the risk of SIDS after immunization with the DTP vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "T-lymphocyte immunity is likely to be an important component of the immune defence against the AIDS virus, because helper T cells are necessary for the antibody response as well as the cytotoxic response. We have previously predicted two antigenic sites of the viral envelope protein gp120 likely to be recognized by T lymphocytes, based on their ability to fold as amphipathic helices, and have demonstrated that these are recognized by T cells of mice immunized with gp120 (ref. 1). A peptide corresponding to one of these sites can also be induce immunity in mice to the whole gp120 protein. Because many clinically healthy seropositive blood donors have already lost their T-cell proliferative response to specific antigen, we tested the response to these synthetic peptides of lymphocytes from 14 healthy human volunteers who had been immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the AIDS viral envelope gene and boosted with a recombinant fragment. Eight of the 14 responded to one peptide, and four to the other peptide, not included in the boost. These antigenic sites recognized by human T cells may be useful components of a vaccine against AIDS. We also found a correlation between boosting with antigen-antibody complexes (compared to free antigen) and higher stimulation indices, suggesting a more effective method of immunization.\r"

The potency of CGRP as a vasodilator and the occurrence of the peptide in nerves associated with blood vessels suggest an important role for CGRP in the regulation of blood flow. The finding that CGRP induces protracted vasodilatation when administered extra-vascularly, to mimic release from nerves, has led us to investigate how the vasodilator activity of CGRP is controlled in vivo. CGRP is often co-localized with substance P in C-fibre nerves. Here, we demonstrate that injection of CGRP with substance P into human skin converts the long-lasting vasodilatation induced by CGRP into a transient response. Experiments in animals reveal that the phenomenon is dependent on the action of proteases from mast cells stimulated by substance P. The results reveal a new regulatory interaction between two neuropeptides and provide evidence for an in vivo role for mast cell proteases.\r"

The tone of peripheral blood vessels is primarily maintained by sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves. Although vasodilator innervation has been identified in certain isolated elastic arteries, it is not known whether vasodilator nerves contribute to the regulation of the peripheral resistance vessels. We present pharmacological evidence for the existence of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) vasodilator nerves in the mesenteric resistance vessel of the rat and that the resistance is controlled by not only sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves but also NANC vasodilator nerves. We also show that the neurogenic vasodilation was selectively abolished by depleting endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator neuropeptide, from perivascular nerves. This indicates that CGRP is a novel vasodilator neurotransmitter and may play a role in control of the total peripheral resistance of systemic circulation through a local reflex mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "88318972\r", 
  ".W": "The newly described T-cell receptor (TCR) delta locus is located inside the TCR alpha locus, between variable region (V)alpha and joining region (J)alpha. Although the delta and alpha TCR genes are physically linked on the same chromosome, they are sequentially expressed during T-cell development. This implies the existence of a highly efficient regulatory mechanism by which these two genes are independently rearranged. We have recently described a genetic element 'T early alpha' (TEA) in humans transcribed in foetal thymocytes, spliced alternatively to constant region (C)alpha, and located between the TCR-delta locus (5') and the group of J alpha segments (3'). Importantly, TEA flanks a common site of rearrangement in the thymus, and distinguishes cells using TCR-gamma/delta (TEA in germline configuration) from cells using TCR-alpha/beta (TEA deleted on both chromosomes). In order to understand this TEA-associated recombination we analysed genomic clones representing these thymic rearrangements. We show that the TEA-associated recombination deletes the delta locus before productive (V delta D delta J delta) rearrangement. The diversity (D)delta and J delta regions, which provide the major source of delta gene diversity, are eliminated as a consequence of delta gene deletion and cannot then be used in conjunction with an alpha-TCR. We propose that the TEA-associated deletion of TCR-delta precedes the formation of an alpha-TCR and could down-regulate TCR-delta formation in maturing thymus.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell differentiation in the thymus involves the coordinate expression of genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of the major histocompatibility complex-restricted heterodimeric antigen receptor (TCR) complex, as well as other functionally important molecules such as CD4 and CD8. The repertoire of TCR expressed by T cells is generally thought to be influenced by positive and/or negative selection events occurring when TCRs on developing T cells interact with self-antigens and major histocompatibility complex components. Using a model system in which specific antigen-reactive cells can be monitored by virtue of their preferential expression of certain TCR beta-chain variable (V beta) domains, it has been shown that self-reactive T cells are clonally deleted during development. We report here that clonal deletion of V+ beta 6 cells in Mlsa mice can be prevented by in vivo neonatal administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4. Furthermore, as anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody treatment resulted in the reappearance of V+ beta 6 cells in the mature CD8+ T-cell subset, it is likely that clonal deletion acts on the CD4+CD8+ thymocyte subset and that this subset is an intermediate stage in the differentiation pathway of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lineages.\r"

  ".W": "A global vaccination strategy must take into account production and delivery costs as well as efficacy and safety. A heat-stable, polyvalent vaccine that requires only one inoculation and induces a high level of humoral and cellular immunity against several diseases is therefore desirable. A new approach is to use live microorganisms such as mycobacteria, enteric bacteria, adenoviruses, herpesviruses and poxviruses as vaccine vectors. A potential limitation of live polyvalent vaccines, however, is existing immunity within the target population not only to the vector, but to any of the expressed antigens. This could restrict replication of the vector, curtail expression of antigens, and reduce the total immune response to the vaccine. Recently acquired immunity to vaccinia virus can severely limit the efficacy of a live recombinant vaccinia-based vaccine, so a strategy involving closely spaced inoculations with the same vector expressing different antigens may present difficulties. We have constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses surface proteins from two diverse pathogens, influenza A virus haemagglutinin and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D. Mice that had recently recovered from infection with either HSV-1 or influenza A virus could still be effectively immunized with the double recombinant.\r"

Recent studies have exploited natural correlations between the expression of a particular V beta gene segment and T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity. We and others (refs 5, 6 and M. Davis, personal communication) have taken an alternative approach. We have generated transgenic mice expressing the alpha beta antigen receptor from the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone 2C (ref. 7). In transgenic mice of the same haplotype as the 2C clone, the 2C TCR was expressed on 20-95% of peripheral T cells. Very few of these T cells carried the CD4 antigen; the vast majority were CD4-CD8+ and were able to lyse targets with the same specificity as the original 2C clone. These results indicate that the alpha beta heterodimer transfers specificity to recipient cells as expected from earlier studies, and that receptor specificity in T-cell repertoire selection is determined by both alpha beta heterodimer and CD4 or CD8 accessory molecules.\r"

One, which is probably the full-length product, trans-activates transcription via an enhancer in the viral regulatory region. A second, containing sequences from the 3' end of the open reading frame, inhibits the trans-activating activity of the first product. We now report the identification and initial characterization of three E2-encoded proteins, with mobilities corresponding to 48, 31, and 28 kDa in cells transformed by the wild-type BPV. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the 48-kDa protein had the longest half-life (40 min), but there was no indication that one species was the precursor of another. The 48-kDa species corresponds to the full-length trans-activating protein. The two smaller species contain only carboxyl-terminal determinants, and either or both could represent inhibitory E2 proteins. Subcellular fractionation localized all three E2 proteins to the nucleus. Consistent with the low rate of viral transcription in BPV-transformed cells, the 31-kDa presumptive repressor species was more abundant than the 48-kDa species.\r"

We have reached the following conclusions: (i) The HIV-2 isolates are (slightly) more closely related to each other than to SIV, compatible with their isolation from different species. (ii) The variability between HIV-2 isolates is similar in degree and kind to that found among HIV-1 isolates. The equivalent degrees of intragroup divergence suggest that HIV-1 and HIV-2 have existed in their present ranges in Africa for approximately equal lengths of time. The fact that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is widespread in regions where HIV-1 is prevalent but not in regions where HIV-2 is prevalent suggests a substantial difference in the morbidity rates associated with HIV-1 vs. HIV-2 infection.

Tumor occurrence is correlated with expression of the transgene in organs in which large numbers of pre-B cells predominate. These tumors, which arise stochastically, are virtually all lymphoblastic lymphomas of the pre-B-cell type. Evidently the isolated enhancer targets oncogene expression and tumorigenesis to the early B-cell population in preference to more mature B-cell populations. The transgene also confers enhanced in vitro growth properties on nontransformed pre-B cells as observed in bone marrow cultures derived from transgenic animals. These cultured cells represent a population in which the activating function of c-myc can be uncoupled from secondary oncogenic events occurring in vivo.\r"

These lines were subjected to functional assays including inhibition of in vivo hapten-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, in vitro hapten-specific interleukin 2 responses, as well as hapten-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assays. In all assays, the functional suppressor phenotype absolutely correlated with CD3 surface expression. Furthermore, we have immunoprecipitated heterodimeric proteins that share molecular features with some receptor polypeptides previously described. CD3 polypeptides found on the surface of suppressor T cells are phosphorylated after phorbol ester stimulation. Collectively these studies unambiguously define the suppressive supernatant function as a product of CD3+ receptor-bearing T cells.\r"

These \"double-negative\" thymocytes are markedly heterogeneous in their expression of other surface markers and include cells at various stages of development. In this study, CD4- CD8- adult murine thymocytes were separated into subsets based on the expression of the \"heat stable antigen\" (HSA) and of Ly 1 (CD5). The sorted subsets were analyzed directly (without prior expansion in culture) for T-cell antigen receptor (TcR) gene rearrangement and mRNA expression and for TcR and CD3 cell-surface protein expression. Very little surface CD3 or TcR expression was detected on the major HSA+ Ly 1low subset. However, the HSA+ Ly 1high, HSA- Ly 1high, and HSA- Ly 1low subsets all contained cells with surface expression of CD3 and TcR. In contrast to previous studies, we found no subset that exclusively expressed either the alpha beta or gamma delta heterodimer, although the ratio of alpha beta+ to gamma delta+ varied widely. Two of these three subsets (HSA- Ly 1low and HSA- Ly 1high) showed very high usage of V beta 8 gene products in the alpha beta heterodimer, but nevertheless included approximately equal to 15% non-V beta 8 alpha beta forms. All CD4- CD8- subsets were found to have extensively rearranged their TcR gamma genes and to express gamma mRNA. Expression of a high ratio of mature [1.3 kilobases (kb)] to truncated (1.0 kb) beta message and presence of alpha message was largely restricted to subsets with TcR alpha beta surface expression.\r"

To more precisely define the region of T4 involved in gp120 interaction, we used purified, soluble forms of T4 anchor-minus polypeptides (produced in a baculovirus system) in conjunction with proteolytic fragmentation, microsequencing, and a specific T4-gp120 binding assay. The results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of T4 including the immunoglobulin variable-region-like domain is required for gp120 interaction. In contrast, the COOH-terminal half of the molecule, containing the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, is not necessary. Furthermore, reduction of intrachain disulfide bonds in the T4 molecular abrogates gp120 binding, thereby strongly implying that the binding site for gp120 is dependent on the stabilized domain structure of the active binding region.\r"

We found two unsaturated acyclic nucleoside derivatives, adenallene [9-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)adenine] and cytallene [1-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)cytosine], that protect various CD4+ T-cell lines from the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV-1. These compounds inhibit the expression of HIV-1 gag-encoded protein and suppress viral DNA synthesis at concentrations that do not affect functions of normal T cells in vitro. They also inhibit the in vitro infectivity of another human retrovirus, HIV-2. Further in vitro analyses of the anti-HIV-1 activity revealed that the presence of two cumulated double bonds between the 1' and 2' carbons and between the 2' and 3' carbons confers antiretroviral activity in certain pyrimidine or purine derivatives containing a four-carbon chain. We have also found that the 4'-hydroxyl group is critical for the in vitro anti-HIV activity of adenallene. Our observations may provide structure-activity relationships for acyclic nucleoside analogues and may be of value in developing a new class of experimental drugs for the therapy of HIV-related diseases.\r"

  ".U": "88320401\r", 
  ".W": "The genomes of all known mammalian hepadnaviruses contain an open reading frame (ORF), designated X, located just upstream from the gene encoding the major viral nucleocapsid polypeptide. This gene is believed to have one or more roles central to the life cycle of these viruses. Consequently, it is surprising that avian hepadnaviruses appear to lack this ORF. However, the observation that the size and position of the core gene in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) genome and the heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) genome is comparable to the combined X and core genes of the mammalian hepadnaviruses suggests that X function(s) may be performed by the major nucleocapsid polypeptide of DHBV and HHBV. Computer-assisted analyses were carried out to test the hypothesis that the primary and secondary structural characteristics of the X gene product are also present in the major core gene product of the duck (DHBcAg) and heron (HHBcAg) viruses. Primary sequence comparison of the major core-associated polypeptides encoded by the avian and mammalian hepadnaviruses demonstrates considerable homology at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of these components. However, the middle portion of the DHBcAg and HHBcAg polypeptide, spanning about half the molecule, is unique. Comparison of this region with the carboxyl-terminal half of the X gene sequences from mammalian hepadnaviruses demonstrates similarities in both primary sequence and secondary structural characteristics. These results suggest that X-like gene product sequences are present in the core gene products of DHBV and HHBV. In addition, a sequence of about two dozen residues at the amino terminus of the mammalian X gene product, overlapping the polymerase gene product, is found in the corresponding position in DHBV. This is consistent with the conclusion that the relationship between the DHBV and HHBV core genes compared to the X and core genes of the mammalian hepadnaviruses may be explained by one or more translocations in the this region of the viral genome. The previous finding of X antigen determinants associated with one or more core-related polypeptides in the mammalian hepadnaviruses, combined with the results of this study, suggests that X gene product function is conserved among these viruses.\r"

Comparison of the UV-footprinting results to the published crystal structure of the EcoRI endonuclease-DNA complex allows us to determine how UV light detects protein-DNA contacts. We find that kinking of the DNA helix in the complex greatly enhances the UV photoreactivity of DNA at the site of the kink. In contrast to kinking, contacts between the endonuclease and the DNA bases inhibit the UV photoreactivity of DNA. Similar analysis of a proteolytically modified endonuclease that exhibits the same sequence specificity as wild-type enzyme but that does not cleave DNA supports these conclusions. Furthermore, detection of enhanced photoreactivity at the same kink in the modified enzyme-DNA complex allows us to conclude that the loss of cleavage activity by the modified endonuclease is not due to its failure to kink DNA.\r"

Previous experiments in vitro with the intact tat protein have shown that these cysteines serve as metal ligands, causing tat to form metal-linked dimers. Ultraviolet absorption spectra show that the synthetic peptide (tat21-38) binds two Cd2+ or two Zn2+ ions per peptide monomer, and some changes in the circular dichroism spectra are seen as the metals bind. The peptide-metal complexes are completely resistant to proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometry demonstrates that this peptide forms metal-linked dimers. The peptide can also combine with the intact tat protein to form metal-linked heterodimers. If these heterodimers are unable to trans-activate viral transcription, tat21-38 could be a lead compound for designing drugs to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

A virus-encoded regulatory protein (Vmw65) is believed to stimulate transcription via this element, although the protein does not bind directly to DNA. Overlapping the TAATGARAT element in many cases is an octamer sequence (ATGCAAAT) that is involved both in transcription by RNA polymerases II and III and in adenovirus DNA replication. So far at least two proteins (OTF-1 and OTF-2) have been identified that bind to the octamer. We show that both affinity-purified OTF-1 and OTF-2 bind to the TAATGARAT sequence and that Vmw65 induces the formation of an additional complex that involves OTF-1 and that is further retarded in a band-shift gel assay. Complementation experiments involving addition of purified OTF-1 to nuclear extracts that have been depleted of endogenous OTF-1 show that at least one other cellular factor(s) is required for complex formation. This cellular factor may be involved in recognition of the GARAT sequence.\r"

DNA mobility-shift during electrophoresis indicated that a 500-base-pair sequence (HS500) of a rice alpha-amylase genomic clone (OSamy-a) specifically interacted with a factor from gibberellin-induced rice aleurone tissue. The amount of complex formed between the HS500 DNA fragment and the gibberellin-induced factor increased in proportion to increasing amounts of aleurone extract and decreased with the addition of unlabeled HS500 DNA fragment. A specific segment of the HS500 fragment was protected from exonuclease III digestion by protein(s) in the aleurone extract, revealing the approximate position of the protein-DNA interaction. In the protected region, there is a direct repeat that overlaps with a potential stem-loop structure. Protein in extracts from leaves, roots, or deembryonated seeds incubated without gibberellin A3 did not bind to the HS500 DNA fragment. However, the binding factor was induced in deembryonated seeds when exogenous gibberellin A3 was added during seed imbibition. This suggests that activation of alpha-amylase synthesis by gibberellin may be mediated by the formation of a factor that interacts with a specific sequence of the alpha-amylase gene.\r"

DNA fingerprinting revealed that the banding pattern characteristic of Sxr' had been replaced by the pattern associated with the native testis-determining region of the normal Y chromosome of that stock, presumably by pairing and crossing-over between the two testis-determining regions of the father's Y Sxr' chromosome. Pairing between the two ends of such a chromosome in a loop-like configuration has been observed by electron microscopy. However, an anomalous crossing-over event of this kind would only give rise to the observed result if the native homologue of the Sxr region were situated on the very minute short arm of the Y chromosome. We therefore conclude that the two linked genes Tdy and Hya, controlling testis determination and H-Y antigen expression, respectively, are located on the short arm of the mouse Y chromosome.\r"

We have cloned the cDNA for one of the drug-detoxifying enzymes overexpressed in multidrug-resistant MCF7 cells (AdrR MCF7), the anionic isozyme of glutathione S-transferase (GST pi). Hybridization with this GST pi cDNA, GST pi-1, demonstrated that increased GST pi activity in AdrR MCF7 cells is associated with overexpression but not with amplification of the gene. We mapped the GST pi gene to human chromosome 11q13 by in situ hybridization. Since multidrug resistance and GST pi overexpression are associated with the loss of ERs in AdrR MCF7 cells, we examined several other breast cancer cell lines that were not selected for drug resistance. In each of these cell lines we found an inverse association between GST pi expression and ER content. We also examined RNA from 21 primary breast cancers and found a similar association between GST pi expression and ER content in vivo. GST pi mRNA content in 11 ER-positive tumors (less than or equal to 10 fmol/mg of protein) was significantly different from the GST pi content of 10 ER-negative tumors (P = 0.002; Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test for two independent samples). The finding of similar patterns of expression of a drug-detoxifying enzyme and of ERs in vitro as well as in vivo suggests that ER-negative breast cancer cells may have greater protection against antineoplastic agents conferred by GST pi than ER-positive tumors.\r"

After disulfide bond reduction, fragments with approximate molecular masses of 95, 60, 50, and 25 kDa are produced. Tests for binding to CD4-positive cells show that only two fragments, the 95- and 25-kDa peptides, are observed in cleavage products that retain the selective binding capacity of gp120. Radiosequence analysis of the fragments after sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting demonstrates that the 95-kDa fragment lacks the N-terminal region of gp120 and starts at position 143 of the mature envelope protein. The 50-kDa fragment starts at the same position. The 25-kDa binding fragment was similarly deduced to be generated as a small fragment from a cleavage site in the C-terminal part of gp120. The identifications of these fragments demonstrate that radiosequence analysis utilizing 125I-labeled tyrosine residues can function as a useful and reliable method for small-scale determination of cleavage sites in proteins. Combined, the data suggest domain-like subdivisions of gp120, define at least two intervening segments especially sensitive to proteolytic cleavage, and demonstrate the presence of a functional region for receptor binding in the C-terminal part of the molecule.\r"

Recently, these and other DNA polymerases have been shown to share several regions of protein sequence similarity. Despite these similarities, antiviral drugs that mimic natural polymerase substrates specifically inhibit herpesvirus DNA polymerases. To study amino acids involved in substrate and drug recognition, we have characterized and mapped altered drug sensitivity markers of nine HSV pol mutants and sequenced the relevant portions of these mutants. The mutations were found to occur within four relatively small regions. One such region, which we designate region A, has sequence similarity only to DNA polymerases that are sensitive to certain antiviral drugs. The other three regions contain sequences that are similar among various DNA polymerases. The multiple mutations occurring within two of these regions make it likely that the regions interact directly with drugs and substrates. Our results lead us to favor a model in which protein folding allows interactions among the four regions to form the substrate and drug binding sites.\r"

  ".W": "Whether the factor VII/tissue factor complex that forms in tissue factor-dependent blood coagulation must be activated to factor VIIa/tissue factor before it can activate its substrates, factor X and factor IX, has been a difficult question to answer because the substrates, once activated, back-activate factor VII. Our earlier studies suggested that human factor VII/tissue factor cannot activate factor IX. Studies have now been extended to the activation of factor X. Reaction mixtures were made with purified factor VII, X, and tissue factor; in some experiments antithrombin III and heparin were added to prevent back-activation of factor VII. Factor X was activated at similar rates in reaction mixtures containing either factor VII or factor VIIa after an initial 30-sec lag with factor VII. In reaction mixtures with factor VII a linear activation of factor X was established several minutes before cleavage of 125I-labeled factor VII to the two-chain activated molecule was demonstrable on gel profiles. Adding antithrombin III and heparin blocked activation of factor X by factor VII/tissue factor but not by factor VIIa/tissue factor. When the antithrombin III and heparin were added 1 min after the other reagents, factor VII/tissue factor activation of factor X was not blocked. These data suggest that factor VII/tissue factor cannot activate measurable amounts of factor X over several minutes. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that a rapid preferential activation of factor VII bound to tissue factor by trace amounts of factor Xa is a key early step in tissue factor-dependent blood coagulation.\r"

By using an automated capillary microinjection system and a fluorescent coinjection marker (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran), individually injected cells can be retrieved and analyzed for DNA synthesis. mRNA isolated from resting T cells is able to block the cells from entering the S phase. The block is reversible and leads to a delay in DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effect is not observed if the injected mRNA is isolated from growth-activated T cells. The disappearance of the inhibition coincides with the approach of the G1/S boundary in both the donor T cells and the recipient human fibroblasts. The mRNA of resting T cells was size-fractionated and the peak inhibitory activity was recovered in a fraction approximately equal to 1.5 kilobases long.\r"

  ".W": "Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) affect many cell functions, the molecular mechanisms of TNF and IL-1 action are not understood. Our present study shows that exposure of human FS-4 fibroblasts to TNF or IL-1 caused a rapid accumulation of intracellular cAMP and an increase in protein kinase activity. Intracellular cAMP levels peaked 3-5 min after the addition of TNF or IL-1 and returned to basal level by 15 min. Increased phosphorylation of histone HII-B protein was demonstrated with extracts prepared from TNF- or IL-1-treated cells, suggesting an increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. No evidence was obtained for protein kinase C activation in TNF-treated FS-4 cells. TNF, IL-1, and forskolin all stimulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA levels in FS-4 cells. The protein kinase inhibitor H-8, inhibiting preferentially cAMP-dependent kinase activity, reduced forskolin-stimulated IL-6 mRNA induction more strongly than TNF- or IL-1-driven IL-6 mRNA induction. These results suggest that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by TNF and IL-1 is important in some actions of these cytokines. In addition, our data on IL-6 induction by TNF and IL-1 suggest that other, yet unidentified, signal transduction mechanisms contribute to TNF and IL-1 actions on gene expression in human fibroblasts.\r"

The map, containing 90 randomly distributed molecular markers, is physically very dense; greater than 50% of the genome is within 1.9 centimorgans, or approximately 270 kilobase pairs, of the mapped DNA fragments. The map was based on the meiotic segregation of markers in two different crosses. The restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage groups were integrated with the five classically mapped linkage groups by virtue of mapped mutations included in these crosses. Markers consist of both cloned Arabidopsis genes and random low-copy-number genomic DNA clones that are able to detect polymorphisms with the restriction enzymes EcoRI, Bgl II, and/or Xba I. These cloned markers can serve as starting points for chromosome walking, allowing for the isolation of Arabidopsis genes of known map location. The restriction fragment length polymorphism map also can associate clones of unknown gene function with mutant phenotypes, and vice versa.\r"

Previous work showed a correlation between the occurrence of these radical changes, referred to by the acronym RIP, and the presence of sequence duplications resulting from the introduced DNA. Various possible causes for the RIP process were investigated. Introduction of a single copy of a DNA fragment containing the Neurospora am gene into a strain having a deletion of this DNA did not lead to RIP, whereas introduction of two or more copies of the same fragment did. A conventional cross of strains having single copies of am at unlinked chromosomal locations was used to build a strain duplicated for am. Both copies of the duplicated gene were subject to the RIP process in crosses of this strain. We conclude that sequence duplications, per se, trigger RIP.\r"

  ".U": "88320547\r", 
  ".W": "The CH family of murine B-cell lymphomas includes several members that are sensitive to growth inhibition when their membrane IgM (mIgM) receptors are cross-linked by anti-mu chain, anti-kappa chain, or anti-idiotypic antibodies. These lymphomas are IgM+, Ia+, and IgD +/- and resemble neonatal B cells in terms of their exquisite sensitivity to anti-IgM-mediated negative signaling as a model for tolerance induction. In this report, we describe the properties of one of these lymphomas, CH33, which had been transfected with a construct containing an allotypically different delta chain constant region and the heavy chain variable region fragment from S107 (T15 idiotype positive). This transfected cell line allowed us to investigate the possibility that membrane IgD (mIgD) and mIgM can mediate different signals. Our results show that the transfected cells retained their exquisite sensitivity to anti-IgM-mediated growth inhibition; however, crosslinking of IgD with anti-delta chain antibody did not inhibit their growth. Furthermore, even prolonged pretreatment with anti-IgD antibodies did not affect cell growth nor did it modulate the inhibitory effects of anti-IgM antibody. Moreover, identical results were obtained with clones of CH33 that express significant amounts of endogenous IgD. Thus, the failure of mIgD to deliver a negative signal does not reflect a defect in the transfected IgD but appears to be a general property of IgD in these cells. The mIgD was shown to mediate transmembrane signals because anti-delta chain treatment resulted in Ca2+ mobilization in transfected CH33 cells and capping of those receptors. We conclude that mIgD can mediate qualitatively different signals than mIgM can and that mIgD expression per se is not sufficient to change the functional phenotype of immature B cells.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA clone encoding a human serine esterase gene was isolated from a library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of allogeneically stimulated, interleukin 2-expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The clone, designated HSE26.1, represents a full-length copy of a 0.9-kilobase mRNA present in human cytotoxic cells but absent from a wide variety of noncytotoxic cell lines. Clone HSE26.1 contains an 892-base-pair sequence, including a single 741-base-pair open reading frame encoding a putative 247-residue polypeptide. The first 20 amino acids of the polypeptide form a leader sequence. The mature protein is predicted to have an unglycosylated Mr of approximately equal to 26,000 and contains a single potential site for N-linked glycosylation. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of clone HSE26.1 are homologous with all murine and human serine esterases cloned thus far but are most similar to mouse granzyme B (70% nucleotide and 68% amino acid identity). HSE26.1 protein is expressed weakly in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells but is strongly induced within 6-hr incubation in medium containing phytohemagglutinin. The data suggest that the protein encoded by HSE26.1 plays a role in cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell antigen receptor is a multisubunit complex composed of seven transmembrane chains (alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta 2). Subunit interactions within this complex were defined by analyzing the subunit composition of partial complexes. These partial complexes were observed in mutant and tumor T cells that fail to synthesize one or more of the receptor chains or in fibroblasts transfected with genes encoding T-cell antigen receptor chains. In addition, partial complexes were generated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies that cause selective dissociation of T-cell antigen receptor chains. The alpha and beta chains were found to form a disulfide-linked dimer in the absence of any of the other chains. The gamma, delta, and epsilon chains were also efficiently associated in the absence of a complete heterodimer. Complexes composed only of delta epsilon or gamma epsilon could be observed. Both these dimers, as well as the gamma delta epsilon trimer, could form stable complexes with alpha beta, even in the absence of zeta 2. The zeta 2 dimer could bind directly to alpha beta. In the absence of a complete clonotypic heterodimer, zeta 2 was not stably associated with gamma delta epsilon. These observations suggest a model in which alpha beta interacts directly with the gamma delta epsilon trimer and zeta 2, with less-direct interaction between the latter two.\r"

After 5 to 7 days of LPS stimulation, WHV DNA-containing particles, which displayed the properties of intact, mature virions, were released into the culture medium. These studies provide evidence for reactivation of a latent WHV infection of circulating lymphoid cells and indicate that the presence of nonreplicating hepadnaviral DNA in lymphoid cells represents a potentially active infection following cellular activation.\r"

The neuropeptide effects occur at low doses, are specific as shown by inhibition studies with a substance P antagonist, and require de novo protein synthesis.

However, a five- to tenfold reduction in progeny virions was observed after the infection of T lymphocytes with the mutant virus.

This study evaluates a devascularization procedure performed without the risks of major surgery and general anesthesia. Fifty consecutive patients, each with an endoscopically proven variceal hemorrhage that was uncontrollable with sclerotherapy, were treated with minimally invasive devascularization. The procedure was performed in three stages. First, the portal pressure was sharply reduced by angiographic embolization of the midsplenic artery. Then the esophagogastric variceal network was thrombosed by means of a catheter introduced during laparotomy, which created a portoazygos disconnection. Finally, the left gastric and left gastroepiploic arteries were embolized, which completed devascularization of the proximal stomach. According to the Child classification, 16 patients were in class B and 34 were in class C. All Child's class B patients (16/16) and 71% (24/34) of Child's class C patients survived hospitalization. One-year survival was 94% (15/16) for Child's class B and 62% (21/34) for Child's class C patients. Rebleeding occurred in 63% (25/40) of the discharged patients but caused the death of only seven. In conclusion, the 20% initial hospital mortality for these difficult patients was significantly better than that reported for emergency surgery, and the rate of rebleeding was comparable to that seen with other nonshunting therapies.\r"

After 6 weeks of pair-feeding, weight gain, plasma amino acid concentration, and the histologic appearance of the liver were similar among the three groups. Hepatic protein synthesis was greater in pair-fed rats with portoportal isografts, although this difference disappeared in the fasted state. Our data suggest that there is little immunologic or metabolic advantage of portal versus systemic venous drainage of small-intestinal allografts in rats.

Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 39 patients (62%) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in nine (14%). There were two perioperative myocardial infarctions and one hospital death. Thirteen patients were not eligible for revascularization. At follow-up (14-26 months) 60 patients were still alive (95%).

  ".W": "The efficacy of aspirin to prevent ischemic cardiovascular disease has received considerable attention recently. To determine the prevalence of aspirin use for cardiovascular disease prevention, the Minnesota Heart Survey examined population-based samples of Twin Cities' adults in 1981 to 82 and 1985 to 86. Over the 4-year period, reported use of aspirin for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis increased from 0.6% to 2.4% in women (p less than 0.05) and from 1.7% to 3.3% in men (p = 0.10). Prophylactic aspirin use was more common in older than in younger adults, in whites than in blacks, in those with a history of cardiovascular disease or hypercholesterolemia, and in health professionals and nonsmokers. Some individuals were apparently taking aspirin for \"primary\" prevention, although it has not yet been approved for that reason. Use of aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention has been increasing and is likely to increase more rapidly over the next few years. This could favorably impact on mortality rates of cardiovascular disease, but untoward side effects of aspirin may be expected to increase as well.\r"

The test battery included graded exercise, which was performed until unbearable leg exertion or chest pain, or both, was present. Onsets of blood lactate accumulation, anginal pain, leg exertion and dyspnea were interpolated for either the lactate concentration 2 mmol X 1-1 or the ratings 2 on the Borg subjective intensity scale. Onsets of blood lactate accumulation and symptom-limited exercise capacity before surgery amounted to 58 and 100 W, respectively. The corresponding figures 6 months later were the same for onset of blood lactate accumulation, whereas symptom-limited exercise capacity had increased by 58%. Blood lactate was the same at rest and mild exercise (congruent to onset of blood lactate accumulation) but more than doubled at symptom-limited exercise capacity (peak blood lactate concentration). Muscle fiber typing showed a low figure for the slow twitch fiber proportion (35%), which was unchanged after 6 months. Fast twitch subtype C was elevated before (7%) but disappeared after surgery, and fast twitch subtype A percent increased correspondingly. The major muscle biochemical changes were in the glycogenolytic pathway and the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme system, which appeared to increase in a quantitative manner, but with an unchanged relative lactate dehydrogenase isozyme pattern. The increased symptom-limited exercise capacity was related to the increased glycogenolytic activity and peak blood lactate (i.e., increased \"anaerobic power\"). Whether the causative explanation was the relief from chest pain, i.e., a psychophysiologic feature or the biochemical changes that took place in the muscle could only be speculated on.\r"

This may be due to changes in sympathetic tone, in hormonal stimulation (both by circulating and intramurally released compounds like angiotensin II with additional presynaptic effects) or in endothelium mediated vasodilation. The loss of endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent dilation in large arteries may originate from endothelial impairment induced by, e.g., chronic hypoxia or hypercholesterolemia. Similar effects result from suppressed local dilator autacoid release brought about, e.g., by circulating atrial natriuretic factor in the presence of a fully functioning endothelium. Finally, attenuated augmentations in flow may be secondary to changes in muscular metabolism, and an increased alpha-adrenergic neurogenic constriction may be present. This may be further enhanced by a local, beta-receptor-mediated angiotensin II release. An impaired dilation at the level of resistance vessels may result from a combination of the mechanisms listed above.\r"

Other various monoclonal antibody studies were also performed to detect the stages of differentiation of the neoplastic cells light microscopically. The authors' study indicated that cytoplasmic Leu-4 (cLeu-4) antigen expression appeared at the early stage of thymic T-cells, together with Leu-9 (CD7) and T101 (CD5). Their immuno-EM study also disclosed that the neoplastic cells at the early stage of thymocyte differentiation all had positive results for cLeu-4 but negative results for surface Leu-4 (sLeu-4). The Leu-4 antigen expression in the neoplastic cells at the stage of common thymocyte differentiation with OKT6- (CD1) positive phenotype was variable, showing cLeu-4+sLeu-4-, cLeu-4-sLeu-4+, and cLeu-4+sLeu-4+, depending on the cases investigated. From these results, they suggest that cLeu-4 antigen appears at the stage of early thymocyte differentiation, followed by predominant sLeu-4 expression at the stage of common thymocyte differentiation, and finally simultaneous expression of cLeu-4 and sLeu-4 at the stage of peripheral T-cells.\r"

Gastric and duodenal mucosae were scored separately, using a 0- to 7-point scale. Scores were graded negative (0), hyperemia (1), gastroduodenitis (2-5), mucosal erosions (6), and ulcers (7). Erosions or ulcers were found in 14% of patients and gastroduodenitis is an additional 10%. We found that none of the 27 risk factors or any combination of factors tested correlated with ulcers, erosions, or gastroduodenitis. Thus, patients with asymptomatic gastroduodenal erosions or ulcerations could not be identified preoperatively, except by endoscopy. Until the significance of these lesions as cause of postoperative bleeding is determined, we recommend routine postoperative gastric pH titration with antacids for patients undergoing major elective operations.\r"

Analysis of the sequence of the M1(Val213) and M2 genes around residue 101 revealed the M1 Arg101----M2 His101 caused a loss of the cutting site for the restriction endonuclease RsaI. Using this enzyme, as well as 19-mer oligonucleotides probes centered at residues 101 and 376, evaluation of genomic DNA from 22 M1 alleles and 14 M2 alleles revealed that residue 101 was Arg in all M1 alleles and His in all M2 alleles, while residue 376 was Glu in all M1 alleles and Asp in all M2 alleles. Despite the differences in sequence at two amino acids, the M1(Val213) and M2 proteins function similarly as assessed by quantification of the association rate constant of each for their natural substrate neutrophil elastase. In the context that there are two mutations separating the M1(Val213) and M2 alleles, it is likely that there is another alpha 1AT variant that was an intermediate in the evolution of these genes.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in both human and murine systems have demonstrated the existence of a second CD3-associated T cell receptor (the gamma delta-TCR) distinct from the alpha beta heterodimer associated with antigen recognition by classical T cells. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for the delta component of the human gamma delta-TCR, the expression of this antigen in both benign, reactive lymphoid tissues and T lineage lymphomas was studied with immunohistologic techniques. In the normal thymus, TCR-delta+ cells constituted less than 5% of the CD3+ thymocytes and were located primarily in the medulla or juxtamedullary cortex. Within the T zones of 16 histologically varied reactive peripheral lymphoid tissues, including four patients with marked predominantly paracortical hyperplasia, the authors identified from less than 1% to a maximum of 5% TCR-delta+ cells. While these results are consistent with the hypothesis that TCR-gamma delta+ cells comprise a small distinct subpopulation of peripheral T cells in humans, selective localization or recruitment of these cells could not be demonstrated in any of a number of tissues or reactive situations. Among 62 T lineage lymphomas, including 14 CD3+/TCR-beta- cases, only two TCR-delta+ neoplasms were identified, both lymphoblastic lymphomas displaying the CD3+/CD4-/CD8- phenotype known to be associated with normal TCR-gamma delta+ T cells. Because the majority of CD3+/TCR-beta- lymphomas did not display TCR-delta, these results argue against the hypothesis that the high incidence of CD3/TCR-beta discordance noted in T lineage lymphomas represents preferential transformation of the TCR-delta-expressing subset.\r"

The interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity, however, was increased significantly on day 1 only as compared with saline-treated hamsters. Next, normal AM were stimulated in vitro by bleomycin. After being fractionated by chromatography, their culture supernatant showed IL-1 activity, which also indicated FP activity. These results suggest that bleomycin directly stimulates AM to release IL-1 in the fibrogenic responses.\r"

It has been shown previously that normal thymic epithelial cells express antigens of early TE cell maturation (A2B5, TE-4) throughout thymic ontogeny and acquire antigens 12/1-2, TE8, and TE-15 at 14 to 16 weeks of fetal gestation. Hyperplastic MG thymic epithelial cells expressed TE antigens in phenotypic patterns similar to that seen in normal postnatal thymus, ie, TE in subcapsular cortex and medulla was TE4+, A2B5+, and 12/1 - 2+ and Hassall's bodies were reactive with antibodies TE8 and TE15. In contrast, thymic epithelium in primary mediastinal thymomas was TE4+, A2B5+, TE8-, and greater than 75% of thymoma epithelium was 12/1 - 2-, a thymic epithelial phenotype similar to that seen on normal fetal thymic epithelium at 14 to 16 weeks fetal gestation. In one subject with a mature epithelial histologic pattern, thymoma epithelium was found to be strongly TE8+, a phenotype suggestive of a later stage of TE maturation. Lymphocytes in five of seven thymomas with immature thymic epithelial cells predominantly expressed immature thymocyte phenotype while two thymomas with immature epithelial phenotype showed a predominance of Langerhans cells and surrounding lymphocytes expressing a mature phenotype. Lymphocytes in the thymoma with differentiated epithelial cells expressed a mature thymocyte phenotype. Thus, in thymomas of varying histologic types, phenotypic abnormalities of thymic epithelium are present; these phenotypic abnormalities may reflect abnormal thymic epithelial maturation.\r"

Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen, and isoflurane. The induction doses of propofol and thiopentone were 2.9 mg/kg and 6.5-7.1 mg/kg respectively; premedication had no significant effect on the induction doses of either agent. Spontaneous movement and hypertonus occurred in about 20% of children with both agents. The use of propofol was associated with a high incidence of pain on injection (injections were mostly in veins on the dorsum of the hand), but this was reduced by mixing lignocaine with propofol. Cardiovascular effects were not clinically significant with either agent. Apnoea occurred in 35% of patients given propofol and in 50% of those given thiopentone. Children anaesthetised with propofol awoke significantly earlier after cessation of all anaesthesia. It is concluded that the use of propofol is safe in children and may have advantages where early recovery from anaesthesia is desirable, but offers no advantage over thiopentone for routine induction of anaesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "This study aimed to detect the difference in hemodynamic and electrocardiographic responses during the prebypass period in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting who were receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, calcium entry blocking drugs, or both beta-adrenergic and calcium entry blocking drugs. Electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia was noted significantly more frequently in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs alone at induction of anesthesia (P less than 0.03), skin incision (P less than 0.05), and sternotomy (P less than 0.002). Heart rate at sternotomy was significantly higher in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs (P less than 0.02) as compared to patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or the combination of both drugs. In conclusion, patients treated with calcium entry blocking drugs alone had significantly higher incidence of perioperative ischemic ECG changes compared with patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs alone or in combination with calcium channel blocking drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of propofol were studied in 50 surgical patients. Propofol was administered as a bolus dose, 2 mg/kg iv, followed by a variable-rate infusion, 0-20 mg/min, and intermittent supplemental boluses, 10-20 mg iv, as part of a general anesthetic technique that included nitrous oxide, meperidine, and muscle relaxants. For a majority of the patients (n = 30), the pharmacokinetics of propofol were best described by a two-compartment model. The propofol mean total body clearance rate was 2.09 +/- 0.65 1/min (mean +/- SD), the volume of distribution at steady state was 159 +/- 57 l, and the elimination half-life was 116 +/- 34 min. Elderly patients (patients older than 60 yr vs. those younger than 60 yr) had significantly decreased clearance rates (1.58 +/- 0.42 vs. 2.19 +/- 0.64 l/min), whereas women (vs. men) had greater clearance rates (33 +/- 8 vs. 26 +/- 7 l.kg-1.min-1) and volumes of distribution (2.50 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.65 l/kg). Patients undergoing major (intraabdominal) surgery had longer elimination half-life values (136 +/- 40 vs. 108 +/- 29 min). Patients required an average blood propofol concentration of 4.05 +/- 1.01 micrograms/ml for major surgery and 2.97 +/- 1.07 micrograms/ml for nonmajor surgery. Blood propofol concentrations at which 50% of patients (EC50) were awake and oriented after surgery were 1.07 and 0.95 microgram/ml, respectively. Psychomotor performance returned to baseline at blood propofol concentrations of 0.38-0.43 microgram/ml (EC50). This clinical study demonstrates the feasibility of performing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses when complex infusion and bolus regimens are used for administering iv anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "Doxacurium chloride is an investigational long-acting neuromuscular blocking drug, which has been shown to be devoid of cardiovascular side effects when administered in modest doses to healthy patients. This is the first hemodynamic study of doxacurium in adult patients with cardiac disease. Forty-one patients scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery were studied. Anesthesia consisted of induction with midazolam 0.2-0.3 mg/kg and sufentanil 0.01-0.03 mg followed by an infusion of sufentanil at 0.03-0.06 mg.min-1. Baseline hemodynamic data were collected during a stable state of sufentanil anesthesia. Doxacurium was then administered in doses of 1, 2, or 3 times its ED95 of 0.025 mg/kg. Hemodynamic measurements were repeated at 2, 5, and 10 min after doxacurium injection in the absence of surgical stimulation. An additional group of control patients received saline instead of doxacurium. Baseline hemodynamic measurements were similar among groups. There was a slight decrease in heart rate in all groups over time. However, there was no significant difference between the groups of patients receiving doxacurium and the control group in which the heart rate decreased progressively from 52 beats/min at baseline to 49 beats/min 10 min after doxacurium administration. At no time was there any significant change in mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, or cardiac output. Likewise derived hemodynamic variables including cardiac index, stroke volume, and pulmonary vascular resistance were unchanged. In addition to the decrease in heart rate, the hemodynamic changes, which reached statistical significance, were clinically insignificant and occurred predominantly in the group of patients receiving doxacurium 0.08 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three patients had pneumoperitoneum attributed to bowel perforation, and two had confirmed bowel obstruction. In each, the clinical findings suggested the diagnosis. We found no instance of silent gastrointestinal bleeding in which plain radiography contributed important diagnostic information.

In rats with established Pneumocystis pneumonia, clindamycin alone at 5 or 225 mg/kg was ineffective. Primaquine alone at 0.5 or 2 mg/kg did not significantly affect the numbers of organisms remaining. The combination of 0.5 mg of primaquine per kg and 225 mg of clindamycin per kg was effective for therapy, lowering the numbers of organisms in the lungs by about 90%. The combination of 2 mg of primaquine per kg and 225 mg of clindamycin per kg was more effective, lowering the numbers of organisms by almost 98%. In the in vivo prophylaxis model, primaquine at 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg did not prevent the development of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immune-suppressed rats. Clindamycin at 50 mg/kg had a modest effect alone, but at 5 mg/kg all animals became heavily infected. At 0.5 mg/kg, primaquine alone reduced the severity of infection, but seven of eight rats were still infected. In contrast, the combination of 5 mg of clindamycin per kg and 0.5 mg of primaquine per kg prevented infection in 8 of 10 rats; 2 rats had minimal infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88325329\r", 
  ".W": "Phosphonoformate and phosphonoacetate encapsulated in liposomes have substantially greater activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 in Vero cell tissue culture than the nonencapsulated compounds at the same dose. Encapsulation of phosphonoformate in liposomes resulted in a 30-fold increase of the antiviral effect with no increase in cytotoxicity measured by inhibition of thymidine incorporation into normal Vero cells. Thus, the selectivity of the liposomal drug increased 27-fold compared with the nonencapsulated compound. Liposome encapsulation of phosphonoacetate at a ratio of 0.3 mumol/mumol of lipid resulted in a 150-fold increase of antiviral activity with a concomitant 250-fold increase in cytotoxicity. However, the selectivity of phosphonoacetate could be increased by reducing the drug-to-lipid ratio. Liposome uptake by Vero cells, measured by the cell association of a nonexchangeable radiolabeled lipid, plateaued after 24 h of incubation and saturated at 60 nmol of lipid per mg of cellular protein at a lipid concentration of 300 microM. The saturation of liposome uptake on the Vero cells may account for the 27-fold increase in selectivity observed with the liposomal phosphonoformate. The greater activity of the encapsulated phosphono compounds is most likely due to their increased transport into the cytoplasm; this occurs subsequent to the uptake and processing of the liposome in the lysosomes of the cell. Liposome encapsulation of these agents may result in superior efficacy against viral infections residing in endocytotically and phagocytically active cells such as macrophages.\r"

In vitro, ganciclovir completely prevented guinea pig cytomegalovirus infection of guinea pig embryonic fibroblasts at concentrations above 32.6 micrograms/ml. In vivo, antibody-negative animals had an average 17-dB elevation in their auditory nerve compound action potential thresholds (P less than 0.01, t test) and showed signs bilaterally of guinea pig cytomegalovirus labyrinthitis 8 days after intrathecal inoculation of virus. Ganciclovir administration starting 1 day before inoculation prevented the development of both cochlear histopathologic change and hearing loss. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus meningitis was observed in both the drug-treated and untreated groups. High-pressure liquid chromatography confirmed the presence of ganciclovir in the serum, perilymph, and cerebrospinal fluid of the drug recipients. Prophylactic ganciclovir thus can protect the cochlea from the histopathologic changes and hearing loss normally associated with experimental guinea pig cytomegalovirus labyrinthitis.\r"

Two further groups of patients, comprising 28 with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and 20 with normal pancreatic function underwent the modified test, and urine samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed a complete separation between groups. The use of PAS eliminates a number of sources of error inherent in a two day Bentiromide test and provides a simplified and accurate diagnostic test for pancreatic insufficiency. The PABA-PAS modified test enables collection of the urine to be done during a single six hour period.\r"

The patients (10 men and 3 women) had a mean age of 51.1 +/- 3.4 years. Four were seen with cardiovascular lesions and documented hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency); 3 had hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency); 3 had Factor XI deficiency; 2 had von Willebrand's disease, and 1 had dysfibrinogenemia. All patients had a history of major hemorrhage after dental extractions or general surgical procedures, and had clearly documented coagulation disorders on hematological evaluation. Elective cardiovascular procedures performed in these patients included aortocoronary bypass grafting (eight), cardiac valve replacement or repair (five), aortic graft placement (one), and carotid endarterectomy (one). The mainstay of perioperative management included appropriate replacement therapy with blood components. Coagulation factor levels were measured routinely to guide therapy. There were no deaths. Two hemorrhagic complications necessitated reexploration. We conclude that in patients known to have congenital coagulation disorders, cardiovascular operations using systemic heparinization can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality when carried out with preoperative and perioperative support from the hematology service, adequate replacement therapy using blood components, and careful monitoring of the coagulation status.\r"

This group constituted 7.0% of all patients undergoing nonemergency coronary revascularization during this period. The left internal mammary artery was used to bypass the endarterectomized LAD artery in 22 patients. There was 1 (2.7%) operative death and 1 perioperative myocardial infarction. At follow-up, which was 100% with a mean of 41.4 months, all endarterectomy patients were in New York Heart Association Functional Class I or II. Twenty-four endarterectomy patients underwent first-pass radionuclide angiographic stress testing 20 months after operation. Twenty patients (83%) had excellent postoperative exercise tolerance, achieving 5 to 7 mets on treadmill testing. Left ventricular functional reserve was preserved, as evidenced by an increase of global ejection fraction from 48 +/- 15% at rest to 59 +/- 18% (p less than 0.005) with exercise. A similar increase was measured in the proximal and distal anterior wall segmental ejection fractions. No difference in response to exercise was found between the internal mammary artery and the vein graft groups. Thus, complete revascularization of the diffusely diseased LAD artery can be accomplished by adjunct endarterectomy without added morbidity or mortality and with excellent functional results.\r"

In our analysis of 13 preoperative and 5 intraoperative variables, diabetics revealed a significantly increased incidence of hypertension (p less than 0.05) and a smaller proportion of men (p less than 0.05). All other variables were not significantly different. The incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, renal failure, neurological sequelae, leg infections, or thromboembolic events was similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Hospital stay, however, was significantly increased in the diabetic group (p less than 0.05). The diabetic patients requiring intraaortic balloon counterpulsation had a significantly higher incidence of all postoperative complications analyzed compared with diabetics without balloon support (p less than 0.01), whereas the nondiabetic subset requiring intraaortic balloon counterpulsation exhibited only a significantly higher incidence of renal failure (p less than 0.01) and neurological complications (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that diabetes per se does not significantly increase morbidity in coronary bypass surgery.\r"

A less well-recognized disorder is that of GVHD in patients receiving blood products containing immunocompetent lymphocytes. Transfusion-associated (TA)-GVHD has a lower incidence and higher mortality (greater than 90%) than bone marrow transplantation-GVHD and until now has been limited to patients with hereditary or acquired immunologic deficits and to patients immunocompromised by chemotherapy for malignant neoplasms. We presently describe a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and who suffered what we believe was TA-GVHD. This diagnosis is supported by considering the chronology of events (in particular, blood transfusion), clinical features (fever, rash, abnormal results of liver function tests, diarrhea, and pancytopenia), and a skin biopsy specimen that revealed basal cell vacuolation and lymphocyte satellitosis that are considered characteristic for this disorder. We believe TA-GVHD can occur in previously immunocompetent patients who receive transfusions of blood products containing functioning lymphocytes and that this awareness will lead to the discovery of additional cases and a better understanding of this disorder.\r"

To our knowledge, no such case has been previously reported. These observations strongly suggest that thyrotoxicosis in silent thyroiditis may be induced by an autoimmune mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The destruction of proliferating lymphoid cells within germinal centers with subsequent replacement by histiocytoid cells has been described in infants and children dying of viral and bacterial infections. The etiology and significance of \"epithelioid germinal centers\" (EGCs) are unknown. The cells implicated in forming EGCs have included histiocytes and dendritic reticulum cells. We have studied four children at autopsy who died at ages ranging from 10 months to 7 years. Three contracted fatal infections, one with fulminant meningococcemia, one with bacterial sepsis, and one with viral hepatitis. The fourth child contracted viral pneumonitis and died of acetaminophen toxicity. Epithelioid germinal centers were found in numerous lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches) in all four cases. Avidin-biotin complex immunohistochemical analysis performed on formalin-fixed splenic tissue from the first three cases and snap-frozen splenic tissue from the second case revealed an absence of B cells in the follicular centers. The mantle zones surrounding follicles were thin but intact. The histiocytoid cells expanding the germinal centers were positive for S100 and R4/23 (dendritic reticulum cells) and negative for numerous histiocyte markers (alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and lysozyme). Increased numbers of killer cells (Leu-7) were present within the affected germinal centers in the three cases in which material was available for immunohistochemical studies. Overwhelming infections in these patients seem to result in anomalous natural killer cell activation resulting in localized nonselective destruction of follicular centers similar to anomalous natural killer cell activity reported to occur in fatal infectious mononucleosis. This may lead to an acquired immunodeficiency that precludes long-term survival in affected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Propofol was administered to eight rabbits by constant i.v. infusion at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg kg-1 min-1 to produce light sedation. The lowest dose was compared with an infusion of Althesin 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1. The rabbits had been previously implanted with aortic and vena caval perivascular balloon cuffs to examine the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex and an aortic thermistor catheter for cardiac output (CO) measurements. A silastic catheter was placed in the pericardial sac so that the cardiac nerves could be blocked with local anaesthetic. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was well maintained with all anaesthetic infusions. At the lower doses of propofol, CO increased by 20% (P less than 0.01) with a corresponding decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR). However, CO and TPR were not changed significantly by Althesin. Both anaesthetics induced a similar tachycardia. Cardiac nerve blockade did not abolish the different CO and TPR responses observed for the two agents. A dose-related reduction in the range and gain of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex was observed with propofol (P less than 0.05). The pattern of alteration of the reflex curve, however, differed between the two anaesthetics and the vagal efferent component was more resistant to blockade with propofol. The relative preservation of baroreceptor reflex responses, and the reduction in TPR by a reduction of resting constrictor tone, suggest propofol may have significant clinical advantages when used as a sedative infusion.\r"

It was found to occur in four patients (5.6% of the total), with the highest incidence (3/34 or 8.8%, p less than 0.001) in patients negative for HLA B27 and without sacroiliac joint disease. The incidence in HLA B27 positive patients was normal. No correlation was found with the severity, bilaterality, or recurrence of uveitis. Although this increased incidence is statistically significant in comparison with the normal population incidence of 2.6%, its direct clinical significance is questionable; the most likely explanation for it includes possible linkage with other immunoregulatory genes. We also found a lower than expected incidence of the phenotype PiMS, and discuss the relevance of this finding.\r"

The differentiation of progenitor cells, purified by collecting blast cell colonies from spleen cell cultures of 5-fluorouracil-treated mice, was evaluated by scoring the number and type of colonies appearing after eight days in semisolid culture. IL-3 induced the formation of both erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage colonies in a concentration-dependent fashion, the plateau being reached at 300 U/mL. However, concentrations of IL-3 alone that had little or no effect (less than or equal to 10 U/mL) induced maximal numbers of erythroid bursts in the presence of Ep (1.5 IU/mL). In the presence of Ep alone, no colonies were seen. Proliferation of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, purified by cell sorting and evaluated by spleen colony assay (CFU-S), was investigated by measuring the total cell number and CFU-S content and the DNA histogram at 20 and 48 hours of liquid culture. Almost no cells or CFU-S survived 20 hours of incubation without the addition of IL-3. The presence of either IL-3 (400 U/mL) or the combination of EP and IL-3 (10 U/mL), supported the maintenance of nearly 40% of sorted CFU-S for 48 hours. Approximately 10% of these cells were in the S phase of the cell cycle at 20 hours and an increase in the total cell number per culture, but not in the CFU-S content, was detected at 48 hours. These data indicate that IL-3 exerts a differentiative and proliferative effect on early stem and progenitor cells, which is concentration dependent. At IL-3 concentrations, which had little or no activity alone, Ep acted synergistically to induce both proliferation of stem cells and differentiation of erythroid progenitors.\r"

When stained with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), all of the blasts were identified as T cells that expressed predominantly the CD4 phenotype (70% of the cells). The remaining blasts were CD8+. These findings demonstrate that ALG stimulates both helper-inducer and cytotoxic-suppressor cells at random since the CD4 to CD8 ratio in the stimulated blasts was the same as in resting PBMC. This ratio is different from that observed in short-term cultures of T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) under the same conditions (CD4 to CD8 ratio less than 1). ALG-stimulated T cells were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2). The clones obtained were expanded and maintained in long term cultures with rIL-2. Thirty-two clones were tested for their capacity of producing colony stimulating activity (CSA) or burst promoting activity (BPA). Twenty-eight of them produced CSA and 12 produced BPA. No correlation was found between the surface phenotype and the ability of the clones to produce CSA or BPA (ie, both the CD4+ and CD8+ clones released the cytokines). When 16 of the same clones were tested for II-2 and gamma interferon (gamma IFN) production, 12 were found to be gamma INF and IL-2 producers. All of the gamma IFN producers also released IL-2, whereas in the single clones no correlation was found with the capacity of releasing BPA and CSA. Supernatants from selected T-cell clones were also tested for hematopoietic growth factor activities in the presence of neutralizing antisera to human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or to Interleukin-3 (IL-3). It was found that most CSA was attributable to GM-CSF, whereas BPA was mainly related to the presence of IL-3.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified and molecularly characterized a novel deletion in the beta-globin gene cluster that increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis in a 24-year-old Laotian man who is heterozygous for this mutation. The patient is asymptomatic with a mild anemia, hypochromia, and microcytosis (Ht = 39%, MCH = 22.8 pg, MCV = 71 fl), normal levels of HbA2 (3.0%) and 11.5% HbF (G gamma A gamma ratio 60 to 40), with heterocellular distribution (52% F cells). Extensive restriction endonuclease mapping defined the 5' breakpoint within the IVS II of the delta-globin gene, between positions 775 to 781 very similar to the 5' breakpoint of the Sicilian delta beta-thalassemia. However, the 3' breakpoint was localized between two Pst I sites 4.7 kb 3' of the beta-globin gene, thus ending about 0.7 kb upstream from the 3' breakpoint of the Sicilian delta beta-thalassemia. This results in a 12.5 kb deletion of DNA. It is of interest that the 5' breakpoint of the deletion residues within an AT-rich region which has been proposed as a specific recognition signal for recombination events, while the 3' breakpoint lies within a cluster of L1 repetitive sequences (formerly known as Kpn I family repeats). The presence of the 3' breakpoints of several other deletions within this region of L1 repeats also suggests that such sequences might serve as hot spots for recombination and eventually lead to thalassemia deletions. The similarity of the 5' and 3' breakpoints of these delta beta-thalassemias underscores the putative regulatory role of the deleted and juxtaposed sequences on the expression of the gamma-globin genes in adult life.\r"

Forty patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were randomized to receive either HES or plasma protein fraction (PPF) as non-blood volume replacement according to standard haemodynamic criteria. The two groups were comparable in all respects. The median colloid use in the first 24 h was 950 ml (range 500-1500) in the HES group and 975 ml (350-2000) in the PPF group (not significant). There was no difference in blood use, urine output or blood loss between the two groups. Tests of coagulation showed the postoperative changes usual in cardiac surgical patients. There was no difference between the two groups in thrombin time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or fibrinogen concentration. Similarly, tests of platelet function and Factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor activity showed no difference between the two groups. We conclude that HES is a safe and effective volume expander, and its relative lack of expense and ease of availability make its routine use after cardiac surgery an attractive proposition.\r"

  ".W": "Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG) were analysed for 63 patients with tumours of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and/or internal auditory meatus (IAM). ABR recordings indicated a clearly prolonged wave I-V interval (above 4.3 ms) in half of the patients, hence suggesting a retrocochlear disorder. For the remaining patients ABR alone was not sufficient for clear diagnosis and ECochG was therefore used in addition. When the latency of wave V was uncertain due to the absence of wave I, the latency of wave N1 was always measurable by ECochG. The NI-V interval evaluated in this way was always significantly prolonged (above 4.5 ms) relative to a control group of patients with a sensorineural hearing loss. In 9 of the 13 subjects without any discernible ABR, an ECochG response could be recorded and its threshold was often better than the mean pure tone audiogram. This study confirms the validity of transtympanic ECochG in the diagnosis of retrocochlear disorders. The time difference observed between wave N1 (ECochG) and wave I (ABR) in CPA tumours is discussed and a possible explanation is proposed.\r"

Seven of 15 cases (47%) had significant contralateral N5 delay on brainstem auditory evoked potential testing, 5 (33%) were normal and 3 (20%) gave no consistent result. It was concluded that Bruns nystagmus occurs in large tumours associated with significant brainstem distortion.

Elimination of the drug depends primarily on hepatic metabolism, with formation of a pharmacologically active demethylated product, norfluoxetine. The present study assesses for the first time the effect of chronic liver disease on these processes. Our data show that in stable alcoholic cirrhosis, the elimination of fluoxetine is significantly reduced. The mean t1/2 was 6.6 vs. 2.2 days and plasma clearance was 4.2 vs. 9.6 ml/min/kg for patients with cirrhosis vs. normal volunteers, respectively. In addition, the formation of norfluoxetine was decreased and its clearance was also reduced. Thus, at steady state both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations will be higher in patients with cirrhosis, unless the dosage is reduced. Conventional liver tests and indocyanine green clearance in cirrhosis did not correlate in a predictive manner with individual patients' elimination of fluoxetine.\r"

The hyperaemic response to 10(-13) mol of each peptide was significantly (P less than 0.01) smaller and shorter in duration than that elicited by 10(-11) mol of the same peptide, and 10(-15) mol of both peptides produced no hyperaemia other than that attributable to needle insertion alone. 3. At all three dosages examined, there were no significant differences between A- and B-calcitonin-gene-related peptides in magnitude or time course of the hyperaemic response. 4.

Defects in this enzyme are responsible for one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism in humans. Duplicated genes for the enzyme are located in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), HLA. In the mouse, the genes encoding 21-OHase have been mapped to the homologous region of the H-2 complex. We previously described an H-2 recombinant haplotype aw18, in which the gene for the complement component C4 and one of the two genes for 21-OHase in the H-2 class III region have been deleted. We now report that newborn aw18 homozygous mice are deficient in 21-OHase activity, and that homozygosity for the aw18 haplotype directly causes death at the early postnatal stage. Morphological changes in the adrenal glands of newborn aw18 homozygotes are also observed. The aw18 recombinant haplotype is expected to serve as a useful and, thus far, unique experimental system to study adrenal steroidogenesis in vivo and as an animal model for the inherited human disease of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

Acetylcholine at concentrations of 10(-11) to 10(-7) M stimulated CRF-41 release. This effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10(-9) to (-7) M). The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective at a dose of 10(-7) M, but produced slight inhibition of this response at 10(-5) M. Norepinephrine at concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M also produced a dose-dependent stimulation of CRF-41 release. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (10(-5) M) and timolol (10(-6) M) blocked norepinephrine-induced CRF-41 release. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists thymoxamine (10(-5) M), prazosin (10(-5) M), and corynanthine (10(-4) M), and the alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan (10(-5) M), were ineffective. Potassium depolarization (56 mM) caused stimulation of CRF-41 release which was dependent on the presence of calcium in the incubation medium. Authenticity of immunoreactive CRF-41 released was demonstrated by chromatographic criteria using gel filtration and reversed phase HPLC. These results provide evidence for a stimulatory role of acetylcholine and norepinephrine on CRF-41 release, and consequently on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in the rat, through actions at a hypothalamic level. The stimulatory effect of acetylcholine is mediated principally through muscarinic receptors and that of norepinephrine through beta-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) has been reported to enhance many FSH-stimulated functions in rat granulosa cell cultures. We therefore, investigated the actions of TGF beta on cultured porcine granulosa cells. We evaluated the production of immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor I (iIGF-I) and progesterone in short term (3-day) and in longer term (7-day) cultures using porcine TGF beta 1 (pTGF beta 1). TGF beta had a biphasic effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated iIGF-I production in short term cultures. A modest stimulatory effect was apparent at 10 pg/ml; however, this end point was completely inhibited by 1-10 ng/ml. TGF beta also had a slight stimulatory effect on basal iIGF-I production at 1 pg/ml, but not at higher levels. In longer term cultures TGF beta did not have a significant effect on either basal or FSH-stimulated iIGF-I production. In both short and longer term cultures TGF beta markedly inhibited basal and FSH-stimulated progesterone production. We also evaluated the effects of TGF beta on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA and found that basal and growth factor-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation were inhibited. No stimulatory effects of TGF beta on progesterone production or [3H]thymidine incorporation could be detected over the dose range tested (1 pg/ml to 10 ng/ml). The effects of human TGF beta 1 and pTGF beta 2 were compared with those of pTGF beta 1 on basal and EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation. Effects of the peptides were qualitatively similar, but pTGF beta 2 was somewhat less inhibitory to EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation than pTGF beta 1. The present studies show that in contrast to the well documented stimulatory actions of TGF beta in cultured rat granulosa cells, this growth factor is a predominantly negative regulator of porcine granulosa cells. With the exception of a modest stimulation of iIGF-I production at very low doses, the effects of TGF beta were to potently inhibit both growth and differentiated function. The inhibitory nature of TGF beta should not be overlooked when considering the possible role of this peptide in ovarian development and differentiation.\r"

Recently, the mRNA for CRF and the CRF peptide have been detected in other brain sites. However, there is little information on the function and regulation of CRF in brain sites outside the paraventricular nucleus. We investigated the content of CRF mRNA in the PVN, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CN), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BN), and the supraoptic nucleus (SON). Northern gel analysis showed that the mRNA for CRF is present in the BN, CN, and SON as well as the PVN, and that all are the same size. In response to adrenalectomy, the level of hybridizable mRNA increased 2.75-fold over 7 days in the PVN; there was no change in the CN, BN, or SON. High dose dexamethasone decreased, but did not eliminate, the PVN CRF mRNA; it was without effect in the other sites. Glucocorticoid replacement with constant low blood levels of corticosterone (5.6 +/- 0.3 micrograms/100 ml) suppressed plasma ACTH and decreased thymus weight while reducing, but not eliminating, PVN CRF mRNA. We conclude that the same sized mRNA for CRF is synthesized in the PVN, BN, CN, and SON, but only the PVN mRNA responds to alterations of peripheral glucocorticoid status. This may imply that only CRF from the PVN is involved in control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

Portal hypertension as well as portal vein thrombosis were demonstrated. The hematologic work-up revealed a deficiency of protein C.

The wounds were treated with gauze (control), lanolin cream (Lanolor or Lanolin with emulsifiers, Squibb) or with human epidermal growth factor (EGF) delivered in lanolin cream (10 micrograms EGF/mL cream). The treatment was applied every 12 hours for 12 to 120 hours after wounding. The reepithelization rate of the wound was determined by standardized morphometric method. In addition, we measured the thickness of the dermis and cell counts in the dermis. We found that most of the statistically significant enhancement of the epithelization rate, thickness of the dermis, and higher cell count in the dermis were attributed to the effect of lanolin cream alone. The additional significant enhancement of healing by EGF over that of lanolin alone was documented in one of our experiments, but was only marginal. In another experiment using another commercial formulation of lanolin, we found no difference between the effect of EGF and lanolin. Several hypotheses were suggested to explain the effect of the two tested lanolin cream formulations, which induced strong inflammatory reaction in the wound.\r"

To assess the efficacy of surgical revascularization in this cohort, 96 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 weeks of an acute myocardial infarction were compared to 485 patients who underwent myocardial revascularization without recent infarction. Fourteen (15%) of the patients with acute infarction were in cardiogenic shock and 82 (85%) patients had unstable angina at the time of surgery. Preoperatively, the patients with acute infarction compared to the patients without acute infarction were older (+3.5 years), had an increased incidence of congestive heart failure (21% vs 13%), and had a lower mean ejection fraction (4% vs 65%). Preoperative intraaortic balloon support was used in 9 patients (65%) with cardiogenic shock, and in 16 patients (19%) with unstable angina. Mean interval to surgery from time of infarction was 14.9 days. Overall operative mortality was 7.3% (7 patients) for the acute infarction group 28% for patients with cardiogenic shock and 3.7% for patients with unstable angina compared to 3.7% for the group of patients without recent infarction. Earlier surgical intervention did not result in a significant increase in operative mortality. Discriminant analysis of the recent infarction cohort demonstrated that preoperative ejection fraction less than 45% and age greater than 70 were the most significant predictors of early mortality. Of the 89 patients surviving surgery, actuarial survival was 97% at 3 years with no late infarctions. At follow-up 95% of survivors were NYHA Class I or II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nifedipine is a potent vasodilator. Until now, its positive effect on cardiac performance after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation was interpreted as the result of a decrease in the afterload. So as to have a better understanding of the precise role of nifedipine under these circumstances, an investigation was carried out on 20 patients, at the end of the CABG operation. Cardiac output (CO), CABG-flow to left anterior descending artery (LAD), mean aortic pressure (AP), mean left atrial pressure (LAP) systemic vascular resistances (SVR), LAD resistances and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (Step 1). Thereafter, a bolus of 0.1 mg nifedipine was injected directly through the CABG to LAD. The same measurements as above were recorded 1 min (Step 2), 4 min (Step 3), and 9 min (Step 4) later, respectively. The most striking results were an average increase of coronary flow of 120% at step (S) 2, and a decrease of mean LAP of 18.9% at S 3. A slight but significant decrease of AP (11% in average) could be observed at S 2-3. No significant effect on CO and peripheral SVR could be noted in the first nine minutes after injection of nifedipine. Decrease of coronary vascular resistance was the earliest and perhaps the most important alteration. It caused an increase of coronary perfusion, improvement of myocardial relaxation and performance followed by a reduction of LAP. The absence of ST alteration in the ECG was representative of a flow which effectively passed through the coronary capillaries, without significant A-V shunt.\r"

Our data call into question the traditional belief that bone turnover decreases in older women.\r"

  ".W": "Secretion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antithyroid microsomal antibodies (AMA) was induced in vitro by coculturing non-T cells (B lymphocytes) and autologous CD4 (helper/inducer) cells from normal subjects stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or a combination of human thyroid microsomal antigen (McAg) and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) strain. With PWM stimulation, AMA production was induced in more IgM-secreting cells (AMA-M) than IgG-secreting cells (AMA-G). However, McAg plus SAC stimulation resulted in similar numbers of AMA-G- and AMA-M-secreting cells. PWM induced a significantly greater number of both AMA-M (and generalized IgM)-secreting cells than did McAg plus SAC, while the number of AMA-G-secreting cells induced by the two stimuli were similar. There were no significant differences between autologous or allogeneic CD4 cells from normal subjects or patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) when cocultured with B cells from normal subjects in terms of helper activity in the induction of AMA-M- or IgM-secreting cells with PWM stimulation. However, with McAg plus SAC, CD4 cells from patients with AITD induced a significantly greater number of AMA-M-secreting cells than did autologous or allogeneic CD4 cells from normal subjects. There was no difference in helper activity between autologous and allogeneic normal CD4 cells in the induction of generalized IgM-secreting cells regardless of the stimulus used. Normal autologous or allogeneic CD8 (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells cocultured with normal B cells and autologous CD4 cells suppressed the induction of AMA-M-secreting cells by PWM stimulation. On the other hand, CD8 cells from patients with AITD suppressed the induction of AMA-M-secreting cells significantly less effectively. All CD8 cells suppressed the induction of IgM-secreting cells equally well. We conclude that 1) B lymphocytes from normal subjects are capable of producing autoantibodies in vitro in the presence of CD4 cells; 2) the helper activity of CD4 cells from patients with AITD to induce AMA-M secreting cells is greater than that of normal CD4 cells with thyroid antigen stimulation; and 3) this helper activity may be due to relatively impaired suppressor activity in thyroid antigen-specific CD8 cells from patients with AITD, whereas the immunoregulatory function of CD8 cells from normal subjects appears to play an important role in the maintenance of self-tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactive CRH was detected in extracts of human term placentae [5.2 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) pmol/g wet wt; n = 9]. Molecular sieve chromatography revealed three size classes of immunoreactive CRH. The major species eluted with the Kav of synthetic rat CRH; the minor species had apparent mol wt (MW) of 18,000 and 8,000. A placental CRH-(1-41)-sized peptide was isolated by fractional acetone precipitation, molecular sieve chromatography, and sequential reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography steps. This peptide had the same chromatographic behavior as did rat CRH in all high performance liquid chromatographic isolation steps as well as the same UV absorbance to immunoreactive CRH ratio after the final purification step. Purified placental CRH stimulated ACTH release from anterior pituitary tissue in a dose-dependent manner and was equipotent with synthetic rat CRH. Partial sequencing indicated that 32 amino acids of this peptide are identical to those of rat and human CRH (sequence deduced from genomic sequence), and comparative peptide mapping with rat CRH provided further evidence that the placental CRH-like peptide is very homologous if not identical to CRH. The high mol wt placental CRH fractions also were partially purified by acetone precipitation, immune affinity chromatography, and gel filtration. Neither of these materials [big form (MW, 18,000) or intermediate form (MWr, 8,000)] stimulated ACTH release from rat pituitary tissue in vitro. Limited trypsin digestion of the highest MW CRH, followed by gel filtration analysis, resulted in conversion to the smaller [8,000 MW-sized and CRH-(1-41)-sized] forms. The detection of a CRH-like peptide in placenta together with our previous demonstration of plasma immunoreactive CRH in pregnant women suggest that the placenta synthesizes and secretes CRH into the maternal circulation.\r"

In the rat, gonadotropins appear to increase granulosa cell tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) content by increasing the cellular concentration of t-PA mRNA as well as by modulating the activity of a specific PA inhibitor (PAI). We obtained granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles of women undergoing either in vitro fertilization or gamete intra-fallopian tube transfer in order to evaluate the roles of PA and PAI in human ovulation. Samples of granulosa cell total RNA were hybridized with probes for t-PA, urokinase-type PA, PAI type 1 (PAI-1), or inhibin A-chain (as a control). Northern analyses revealed that the RNA of granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles contained little or no detectable PA mRNA. In contrast, two species of PAI mRNA were detected in relative abundance. The signal intensity produced by the PAI-1 probe varied by about 8-fold among patient samples, suggesting that PAI-1 may be useful as a marker of follicular maturation and differentiation. These results demonstrate that human granulosa cells collected immediately before ovulation contain PA inhibitor mRNA, yet have little or no PA mRNA.\r"

In view of its potential role in proliferative and inflammatory renal glomerular diseases, we examined the effects of EGF both on cultured rat mesangial cells and on in vivo glomerular hemodynamics. Mesangial cells possess specific, saturable EGF receptors of differing affinities, with Kd's of 0.1 and 1.7 nM, respectively. EGF produced a rapid increase in intracellular pH of 0.12 +/- 0.01 pH U, which was sodium dependent and amiloride inhibitable. The addition of EGF to mesangial cells cultured on either glass or dimethylpolysiloxane substratum induced reproducible cell contraction. Intrarenal EGF infusion did not affect systemic blood pressure or hematocrit but reversibly decreased GFR and renal blood flow from 4.19 +/- 0.33 to 3.33 +/- 0.26 and from 1.17 +/- 0.09 to 0.69 +/- 0.07 ml/min, respectively. Glomerular micropuncture confirmed decreases in single nephron plasma flow and in single nephron GFR (from 142 +/- 9 to 98 +/- 8 and from 51.6 +/- 11.7 to 28.5 +/- 3.5 nl/min, respectively) which were due to significant increases in both pre- and postglomerular arteriolar resistances (from 1.97 +/- 0.31 to 2.65 +/- 0.36 and from 1.19 +/- 0.11 to 2.00 +/- 0.15 10(10) dyn.s.cm-5 respectively) and to a significant decrease in the ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, which fell from 0.100 +/- 0.019 to 0.031 +/- 0.007 nl/(s.mmHg). These studies demonstrate that mesangial cells possess specific receptors for EGF, and exposure of these cells to physiologic concentrations of EGF results in an in vitro functional response characterized by activation of Na+/H+ exchange and by resultant intracellular alkalinization, as well as by cell contraction. EGF administration in vivo significantly reduces the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, which, in combination with EGF-induced constriction of both preglomerular and postglomerular arterioles, results in acute major reductions in the rates of glomerular filtration and perfusion.\r"

Antibody from patient T.K. acted like a mirror image of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies, O-81, as determined by a competitive inhibition RIA. Antibodies from patient S.U. also seemed to be Ab 2 beta and Ab 2 gamma to anti-double-stranded(ds) DNA antibodies, NE-1. Most of normal subjects, on the other hand, had antibodies that bound to the human monoclonal anti-ds DNA antibodies, NE-1, NE-13, 7F4, and O-81. The Id-anti-Id interaction was not inhibited by the addition of DNA. Thus, normal subjects had Ab2 alpha activity that recognizes Id determinants in the framework region common among anti-DNA antibodies, whereas antiidiotypic antibodies in most SLE sera appear to show Ab 2 beta and Ab 2 gamma activity. The results provide evidence that the Id network system regulates immunological tolerance to DNA in humans.\r"

Monomeric C1q-binding IgG was isolated from five SLE plasmas by C1q affinity chromatography and gel filtration. All C1q-binding IgG preparations and their F(ab')2 fragments bound to both C1q and the collagen-like region of C1q by an ELISA. To rule out the possibility that small DNA-antiDNA immune complexes caused this binding activity, Fab' fragments of the C1q-binding IgG preparations were digested with DNase I to degrade any DNA. The Fab' fragments continued to bind to C1q and its collagen-like region after this treatment. C1q-binding IgG was heterogenous on isoelectric focusing. Interaction of C1q-binding IgG with solid-phase C1q was retained in 1 M NaCl, whereas the binding of DNA or heat-aggregated IgG to solid-phase C1q was abrogated or markedly diminished. The association constant of C1q-binding IgG with solid-phase C1q was 2.7 X 10(7) M-1.

An urushiol-specific, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent T cell clone (RLB9-7) was generated from the peripheral blood of a patient with a history of allergic contact dermatitis to T. radicans. This clone proliferated specifically to both leaf extract and pure urushiol. Although the clone had the phenotype CD3+CD4+CD8+, proliferation to antigen was blocked by anti-CD8 and anti-HLA-A, B, C, but not by anti-CD4, suggesting that CD4 was not functionally associated with the T cell receptor. Furthermore, studies with antigen-presenting cells from MHC-typed donors indicated that the clone was MHC class 1 restricted. RLB9-7 was WT31 positive, indicating it bears the alpha beta T cell receptor. The clone lacked significant natural killer cell activity and produced only low levels of IL-2 or gamma-interferon upon antigen stimulation. Addition of RLB9-7 to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of urushiol inhibited the pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG synthesis. This suppression was resistant to irradiation (2,000 rad) and was not seen when RLB9-7 was added to allogeneic cells, even in the presence of irradiated autologous antigen-presenting cells, suggesting that suppression was MHC restricted and not mediated by nonspecific soluble factors. However, RLB9-7 cells in the presence of urushiol inhibited the synthesis of tetanus toxoid-specific IgG by autologous lymphocytes, indicating that the suppression, although triggered specifically by urushiol, was nonspecific.\r"

  ".U": "88331392\r", 
  ".W": "To further our understanding of the functional role of catecholaminergic systems in regulating hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion, we assessed the direct effects of a multiplicity of catecholamine agonists and antagonists on hypothalamic CRH secretion. To accomplish this, we used an in vitro rat hypothalamic organ culture system in which CRH secretion from single explants was evaluated by a specific RIA (IR-rCRH). Norepinephrine (NE) stimulated IR-rCRH secretion dose dependently, with peak effects in the nanomolar range. The effect of NE was antagonized by the mixed alpha antagonist phentolamine, the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin, and the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine, but not by the beta blocker, L-propanolol. Compatible with these data were the findings that the alpha 1 agonist phenylephrine and the alpha 2 agonist clonidine both stimulated IR-rCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. On the other hand, whereas the beta agonist, isoproterenol, caused a weak, non-dose-dependent increase in IR-rCRH secretion, this effect could not be antagonized by L-propanolol. Despite pretreatment with serotonin and acetylcholine antagonists, the effect of NE upon IR-rCRH secretion was undiminished, suggesting that NE-induced CRH secretion is not mediated by either neurotransmitter. On the other hand, pretreatment with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) attenuated NE-induced IR-rCRH secretion. Whereas epinephrine (E) stimulated IR-rCRH secretion, this occurred only at higher concentrations, and was antagonized by phentolamine, but not by L-propanolol. Dopamine (DA) had a weak stimulatory effect that could be antagonized by the DA1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, but not by phentolamine. We conclude that NE and E stimulate hypothalamic IR-rCRH secretion via alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors. The effect of NE upon IR-rCRH secretion is not apparently mediated by serotonergic or cholinergic interneurons, but is modulated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. These data support the idea that the central catecholaminergic systems are excitatory rather than inhibitory upon CRH secretion when acting directly at the hypothalamic level.\r"

Serum PTH in pseudohypoparathyroidism was increased before treatment (0.70 +/- 0.34 ng/ml, P less than 0.05) and was normal during the treatment (0.50 +/- 0.13 ng/ml). In idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, the active vitamin D3 increased serum osteocalcin without PTH. In pseudohypoparathyroidism, PTH may increase serum osteocalcin or modulate the effect of active vitamin D3 on serum osteocalcin.\r"

  ".W": "Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (ecto-5'-NT) is believed to be a maturation marker for human B lymphocytes because its expression increases during normal development and is reduced in many patients with B cell immunodeficiencies. To determine whether this enzyme defines functional subsets of B lymphocytes, human peripheral blood B cells, separated into ecto-5'-NT positive and negative populations by using goat anti-5'-NT antibodies and the fluorescence-activated cell sorter, were compared for their ability to secrete polyclonal immunoglobulin. Both populations synthesized equivalent quantities of IgM in response to a T cell-dependent (PWM) or T cell-independent (EBV) stimulator of polyclonal immunoglobulin biosynthesis. However, ecto-5'-NT+ B lymphocytes synthesized 8- to 26-fold more IgG per cell than ecto-5'-NT- B cells. These data provide the first direct evidence that ecto-5'-NT is a marker for the functional maturation of human B cells and support the hypothesis that ecto-5'-NT deficiency in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia results from a block in B lymphocyte maturation.\r"

Mapping of these antigens on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is important since these antigenic determinants may serve as target structures in the rejection process, and it ultimately opens the possibility to match for these antigens. Using a cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay with H-Y-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes as effector cells, a dose-dependent growth inhibition up to 100% of myeloid (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E) and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) HPC of male donors was obtained, indicating expression of the H-Y antigen on these progenitor cells. In contrast, inhibition of relatively mature erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells was only 40-50%, indicating that the recognition of the H-Y antigen diminished during maturation of erythroid and myeloid HPC. Our results show that the H-Y antigen can be recognized on HPC as a target for cytotoxic T cell responses. This may be important in graft rejection of male donor bone marrow grafts by female recipients.\r"

Granulocyte-mediated killing of microfilariae is enhanced by addition of fresh serum. Lack of C4 did not significantly reduce the observed increase in cytotoxicity. The addition of highly purified monomeric human Clq (0.2 microgram/ml) in the presence of immune IgG resulted in a two- to fivefold enhancement of killing (P less than 0.025). C1q enhancement of killing occurred in the absence of fluid-phase IgG, but killing was significantly less than when both fluid-phase IgG and C1q were present. The effect of C1q was inhibited by the addition of solubilized type I collagen (44-92% inhibition of killing, P less than 0.05). Significant 125I-Clq binding to microfilariae occurred only in the presence of immune IgG. In addition, C1q in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml resulted in a dose-dependent increase in binding of 125I-immune IgG to microfilariae. Finally, when purified C1q was added to preopsonized, washed microfilariae, granulocyte production of superoxide was increased from 0.25 +/- 0.07 to 0.68 +/- 0.07 nm/10(6) cells.10 min (P less than 0.01). These results describe a novel functional role for C1q in enhancement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity towards nonphagocytosable targets.\r"

We sought to determine if insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) could act as a growth factor for human T cells and to characterize its receptor on resting and activated cells. Recombinant IGF-I induced two separate functions. It was chemotactic for and increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine into both unactivated (resting) and mitogen-activated T cells. High-affinity 125I-IGF-I binding to human T cells was saturable with an apparent Kd of 1.2 +/- .6 X 10(-10) M for binding to activated T cells and 1.2 +/- .9 X 10(-10) for unactivated T cells. The calculated binding for activated cells was 330 +/- 90 and for resting cells 45 +/- 9 high-affinity receptor sites per cell. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I to resting or activated T cells revealed a radioligand-receptor complex of 360,000 mol wt when analyzed by SDS-PAGE without reduction and complexes of 270,000 and 135,000 mol wt upon reduction; prior incubation with excess unlabeled IGF-I prevented formation of the 125I-IGF-I receptor complex. Our data suggest that both resting and activated T lymphocytes bear functional IGF-I receptors similar to those found in other tissues. These receptors may mediate T cell growth and chemotaxis.\r"

This antibody, when purified, was capable of inhibiting the polymerization of normal fibrin monomers, apparently through binding to the alpha fibrinogen chain. 6 mo later the patient was asymptomatic, coagulation tests were normal, and the antifibrinogen autoantibody was barely detectable. At this time, affinity-purified autologous and rabbit antifibrinogen antibodies were capable of absorbing an IgG kappa antibody from the patient's serum, which reacted indistinctly with both autologous and xenogeneic antifibrinogen antibodies in enzyme immunoassays. It has been concluded that the patient's dysfibrinogenemia was the result of an antifibrinogen autoantibody, and that later on an anti-idiotype antibody, which binds an interspecies cross-reactive idiotype expressed on anti-human fibrinogen antibodies, inhibited the production of the antifibrinogen autoantibody which led to the remission of the disorder.\r"

All known HLA-B27 amino acid sequences contain a cysteine residue at position 67; no other published HLA class I sequence contains a cysteine within the hypervariable region of the alpha 1 domain, which extends from amino acid residues 63-84. To investigate the role of this cysteine residue in the antigenic structure of HLA-B27, we isolated a genomic clone encoding a molecule of the HLA-B27.1 subtype and performed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to convert the cysteine at position 67 to a tyrosine. When transfected into mouse L cells, both the wild-type and Cys67----Tyr67 mutant B27 genes directed the synthesis and surface expression of molecules reactive with the monomorphic anti-HLA class I antibody W6/32. However, only the L cells transfected with the wild-type B27 gene reacted with the anti-B27 antibody ME1; L cells transfected with the mutant B27 were completely unreactive with this antibody. Experiments with hybrid exons created from the HLA-B27 and HLA-A2 genes yielded results consistent with the mapping of the ME1 epitope to the B27 alpha 1 domain. A second anti-B27 antibody, GS145.2, also showed markedly reduced binding to the Cys67----Tyr67 mutant. These studies document the importance of the unique Cys67 residue in the antigenic structure of HLA-B27.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive quantification of regional myocardial metabolism would be highly desirable to evaluate pathogenetic mechanisms of heart disease and their response to therapy. It was previously demonstrated that the metabolism of radiolabeled acetate, a readily utilized myocardial substrate predominantly metabolized to carbon dioxide (CO2) by way of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, provides a good index of oxidative metabolism in isolated perfused rabbit hearts because of tight coupling between the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. In the present study, in a prelude to human studies, the relation between myocardial clearance of carbon-11 (11C)-labeled acetate and myocardial oxygen consumption was characterized in eight intact dogs using positron emission tomography. Anesthetized dogs were studied during baseline conditions and again during either high or low work states induced pharmacologically. High myocardial extraction and rapid blood clearance of tracer yielded myocardial images of excellent quality. The turnover (clearance) of 11C radioactivity from the myocardium was biexponential with the mean half-time of the dominant rapid phase averaging 5.4 +/- 2.2, 2.8 +/- 1.3 and 11.1 +/- 1.3 min in control, high and low work load studies, respectively. No significant difference was found between the rate of clearance of 11C radioactivity from the myocardium measured noninvasively with positron emission tomography and the myocardial efflux of 11CO2 measured directly from the coronary sinus. The rate of clearance of the 11C radioactivity from the heart correlated closely with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001) as well as with the rate-pressure product (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). Hence, the rate of oxidation of 11C-acetate can be determined noninvasively with positron emission tomography, providing a quantitative index of oxidative metabolism under diverse conditions.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 205 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction 2 to 162 months (mean 66) after bypass surgery and 205 control patients with myocardial infarction were compared and followed up for 34 +/- 25 months after hospital discharge. At baseline the postbypass group contained more men (p less than 0.03) and more patients with previous myocardial infarction (p less than 0.06), but the groups were otherwise comparable. Indexes of infarct size were lower in postbypass patients: sum of ST elevation, QRS score, peak serum creatine kinase (CK) (1,115 +/- 994 versus 1,780 +/- 1,647 IU/liter) and peak MB CK (all p less than or equal to 0.001). Postmyocardial infarction ejection fraction was 45 +/- 15% in the postbypass group and 43 +/- 15% in the control group (p = NS); in-hospital mortality rate was 4 and 5%, respectively (p = NS). When patent grafts were taken into account, the two groups were comparable in extent of coronary artery disease. At 5 years after discharge, cumulative mortality was similar in the postbypass and control groups (30 versus 25%, respectively, p = NS). However, postbypass patients had more reinfarctions (40 versus 23%, p = 0.007), more admissions for unstable angina (23 versus 18%, p = 0.04) and more revascularization procedures (34 versus 20%, p = 0.04) than did control patients. The total for these events at 5 years was 70% in the postbypass group and 49% in the control group (p = 0.001). Thus, although patients with previous bypass surgery who develop acute myocardial infarction have a smaller infarct, their subsequent survival is no better than that of other patients with acute myocardial infarction. They experience more reinfarctions and unstable angina. Previous bypass surgery is an important clinical marker for recurrent cardiac events after myocardial infarction.\r"

Thallium studies were analyzed using polar \"bull's-eye\" maps. For both immediate and delayed images, abnormalities were quantified as a thallium score by calculating a standard deviation-weighted sum of pixels greater than 2.5 SD below gender-matched normal limits. One hundred forty-four of 160 studies indicated abnormalities before angioplasty. Of these 144, incomplete redistribution occurred in 111 (77%): 16 (14%) in patients with and 95 (86%) in patients without prior Q wave myocardial infarction. After angioplasty, improvement in delayed image score occurred in 8 (50%) of 16 patients with prior infarction and 72 (76%) of 95 patients without prior infarction (p less than 0.05). After angioplasty, delayed images were normal in 1 (6%) of 16 patients with prior infarction and 32 (34%) of the 95 without (p less than 0.05). Before angioplasty, delayed image scores were positively correlated with scores in the immediate postexercise images in patients with (r = 0.84) and those without (r = 0.69) prior infarction. To determine if additional delayed images could help differentiate scar from ischemia, an 8 to 24 h delayed image was obtained in each of 40 other patients with incomplete redistribution at 4 h. Of 28 patients without prior infarction, 15 had no redistribution, and 13 had further redistribution at 8 to 24 h.\r"

In an effort to develop an animal model for such therapeutic intervention, the current study was undertaken. Fourteen female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), aged 18-25 years, received a 7-day course of either Thymosin Alpha One (TA1) or placebo, and in vitro and in vivo immunologic analyses were performed. The relative percentage of T-cells and T-cell subsets declined during treatment in both TA1 and placebo groups. Nevertheless, mitogen-induced proliferation and NK-cell function were increased in most monkeys that received TA1, a trend that was apparent but not statistically significant. The antibody response to tetanus toxoid vaccine was not greater in the TA1 treatment group when compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that TA1 can be safely administered to old monkeys and that such treatment, if undertaken in a larger or more sustained trial, may be associated with demonstrable biologic activity. Further studies are warranted to determine the potential for this or similar agents to reduce the consequences of age-associated immune deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-three patients (34.5% Child's C class) with at least one severe variceal hemorrhage and treated with repeated endoscopic sclerotherapy had a follow-up of 1-6 years (mean 20 months). The risk of rebleeding decreased significantly from 2 months after onset of sclerotherapy. Sixty-four patients (or 48%) rebled, within 2 months in 45 (70%). The incidence of rebleeding correlated with Child's category and with the size of the varices. The 2-month mortality rate was 28.6%; two-thirds died of severe rebleeding. Thirteen patients underwent emergency surgery for bleeding uncontrolled by sclerotherapy; nine of them died. Of the 120 treated only by sclerotherapy 93% ultimately died, 90% from variceal rebleeding. Mortality related to the liver disease was thus determined by rebleeding mainly within 2 months and by hepatic failure but not by etiology of the disease or number of previous hemorrhages. The more pronounced mortality in Child C versus B or A patients is thus due to early rebleeding and to more pronounced liver insufficiency in the early and later period. Varices could not be eradicated within 1 year by sclerotherapy in 9 patients; 68 of the 72 patients alive had total eradication, but recurrence of varices was observed in 19 (or 28%) within 1 year, independent of the etiology and severity of liver disease and varices. Only four patients rebled within 1 year, with no mortality. After 1-4 years, another five recurrences were noted, with two nonfatal bleeding episodes. This study argues for continuation of sclerotherapy until total eradication of varices as well as for regular follow-up to avoid recurrences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated responses to recall antigen in ten cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy and correlated these responses with in vitro proliferation data. Before therapy, eight of ten patients responded normally to at least two of seven antigens of a multitest system (greater than or equal to 2 mm induration at 48 hours), with a mean induration score of 17.9 +/- 4.4 mm and 2.7 +/- 0.5 positive responses per patient. This decreased to 5.9 +/- 2.7 mm (P = .01) and 1.2 +/- 0.5 responses (P = .03) after a week of interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy, and further to 0.7 +/- 0.7 mm and 0.1 +/- 0.1 positive responses during a second week of therapy consisting of IL-2 plus activated autologous lymphocytes (P less than .01). The in vitro proliferation indices for lymphocytes obtained before skin test application were significantly less after IL-2 compared with pretreatment for concanavalin A ([con-A] Miles Laboratory, Elkhart, IN) stimulation (3.3 +/- 0.7 to 1.3 +/- 0.1; P = .03) and in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) (41.5 +/- 8.5 to 16.8 +/- 3.8; P = .02), and during the second week of therapy for in vitro IL-2 stimulation (83.3 +/- 16.8 to 42.9 +/- 12.0; P less than .01). When skin responses were directly compared with in vitro proliferation data, a significant correlation was observed for tetanus (r = .75; P less than .01), streptococcal antigen (r = .83; P less than .01), tuberculin (r = .83; P less than .01), and candida (r = .78; P less than .01). Thus, significant decreases in skin test responses and in vitro proliferation were demonstrated after therapy compared with pretreatment. Flow cytometry revealed marked increases in T-lymphocyte numbers after IL-2 alone (973 +/- 252 to 3,436 +/- 754 cells/mL; P less than .01) and IL-2 receptor-bearing cells (105 +/- 28 to 983 +/- 215; P less than .01), but not in numbers of B-lymphocytes or monocytes. Induced anergy to skin test antigens was seen during a period of relative and absolute T-lymphocyte expansion. We conclude that immunotherapy with high-dose IL-2 with or without activated lymphocytes results in a decreased response to recall antigens during a period in which lymphoid cells with nominal activation markers (Tac, DR) increase.\r"

  ".U": "88332640\r", 
  ".W": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a selective neurotoxin to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, has been shown to be metabolized by microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine N-oxide and by cytochrome (cyt.) P-450 to 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the liver. The present study was conducted to determine whether and to what extent each of these metabolic processes would function as the detoxication pathway(s) of MPTP. Administration of either MPTP metabolites, MPTP N-oxide or 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, to mice resulted in no significant reductions in striatal dopamine and its metabolites. Pretreatment of mice with alternate substrate of FMO, N-methylmercaptoimidazole or thiobenzamide significantly (P less than .001 to .05) enhanced MPTP-induced reductions in striatal dopamine and its metabolites. In contrast, neither pretreatments with cyt. P-450 inhibitors, SKF-525A (2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenyl-valerate), quinidine and cimetidine nor with the inducers, phenobarbital and 3-methyl-cholanthrene altered the neurotoxic effects of MPTP. The rate of clearance (Vmax/Km) of N-oxygenation by hepatic microsomes from intact mice was 32 times greater than that of N-demethylation. Although phenobarbital treatment increased Vmax/Km of N-demethylation by 100%, it was still 10 times lower than that of N-oxygenation. Thus, the different responsivenesses of MPTP-treated mice to alternate substrates of FMO and cyt. P-450 modulators appear to come from the difference in the rate of metabolism between N-oxygenation and N-demethylation of MPTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The muscarinic receptors coupled to pepsinogen secretion on isolated frog esophageal peptic cells have been characterized using functional and radioligand binding techniques. N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) binding to intact cells was complex and indicative of a high affinity, low capacity site and a high capacity uptake site. Binding to the high capacity site was inhibited by atropine with high affinity (IC50, 3 nM) and by imipramine and propranolol with IC50 values of 70 and 270 nM, respectively. After inhibition of uptake by 30 microM propranolol, [3H]NMS bound to a single population of high affinity sites (KD, 125 +/- 16 pM), which exhibited binding site maximum of 2.1 fmol/10(6) cells, equivalent to 1260 sites/cell. Binding to these sites was reversible, stereoselective and inhibited by muscarinic receptor agonists with an order of potency: oxotremorine greater than acetylcholine greater than carbachol greater than bethanechol and by antagonists with an order of potency:atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116 (11-2[2-[[diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one). Pepsinogen secretion was stimulated by the agonists with an order of potency: acetylcholine greater than or equal to carbachol greater than oxotremorine greater than bethanechol. Atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 competitively inhibited carbachol-stimulated pepsinogen secretion with pA2 values of 9.58, 7.37 and 6.68, respectively, which correlated with their log (inhibition constants) for receptor binding. By contrast, agonists with significant efficacy exhibited EC50 values which were 20 to 90 times lower than their inhibition constants for binding which suggests the possibility of \"spare\" muscarinic receptors. Our findings indicate that functional muscarinic receptors on peptic cells exhibit similar characteristics to the high affinity sites labeled by [3H]NMS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of the complement system with generation of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins occurs during immediate hypersensitivity reactions; furthermore, the administration of C3a and/or C5a into isolated hearts causes a dysfunction that closely resembles cardiac anaphylaxis. To determine whether complement is activated and anaphylatoxins are generated in the course of immediate hypersensitivity reactions of the heart, we have challenged presensitized isolated guinea pig atria and papillary muscles with the specific antigen in the presence of a source of complement. We have found that the anaphylactic reaction of these cardiac preparations is characterized by complement activation and C3a generation, as well as by histamine release and positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. The amounts of C3a generated and histamine released directly correlated with the extent of C3 consumption. Furthermore, when C3a and C5a inactivation by serum carboxypeptidase N was prevented by DL-2-mercapto-methyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid, anaphylactic histamine release was enhanced, and chronotropic and inotropic responses were potentiated and prolonged. Notably, the administration of C3a to nonsensitized guinea pig atria and papillary muscles caused positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, which were associated with histamine release and were antagonized by the H2 receptor blocker cimetidine, thereby mimicking the effects of anaphylaxis. Our findings indicate that complement activation and anaphylatoxin generation are typical of cardiac anaphylaxis and suggest that anaphylatoxins function as mediator-modulators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions of the heart.\r"

SF PBM suppressed production of IL-2, but not proliferative responses to this lymphokine. It was sensitive to acid (pH 2.6), heat (56 degrees C), and tryptic digestion. It retained activity in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), had no interferon activity and no non-specific cytotoxicity. Although crude SF PBM contained IgG and PGE2, these were not associated with its 2 active fractions. SF PBM was partially purified on a G-200 Sephadex column. IL-2 suppressive activity was detected in 2 fractions of molecular weights corresponding to greater than 150 kD and 40-60 kD, the latter acting only in the presence of monocytes. SF PBM appear to affect directly the IL-2 producer cell, since it suppressed IL-2 production by (1) mitogen stimulated PBM depleted of CD8+ suppressor cells and by (2) mitogen induced Jurkat cells. These \"spontaneous\" suppressive factors were ubiquitous in SLE, and may be important tools for studying the defective IL-2 production in SLE and its significance in the development of the disease.\r"

In addition, the presence of surface target antigens is thought to be essential. These requirements may be more stringent than necessary for the clinical usefulness of MAbs. We have demonstrated selective localization of a MAb to keratin polypeptides in malignant breast epithelium under conditions of passive infusion of antibody in fresh surgical specimens of breast carcinoma. Although these proteins are normal intracellular constituents of epithelial cells throughout the body, localization of antikeratin antibodies only within the tumor population is most probably associated with the presence of cells permeable to macromolecules. This permeable tumor cell fraction could be recruited for targeting neighboring impermeable tumor cells with radioisotopes or other antitumor agents conjugated to antibodies directed against intracellular antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The timing within the estrous cycle of surgical removal of a transplanted murine mammary tumor profoundly influences the frequency of pulmonary metastases. We investigated the potential role of the immune response in this phenomenon by measuring splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in syngeneic tumor-free mice of two age groups at each of two circadian times and in each of four estrous stages. Estrous stage was determined by assessment of vaginal smear cellularity immediately prior to killing and spleen harvest. In a single-cell splenocyte preparation, NK cytotoxicity against a standard tumor cell target was assessed using a radiolabeled chromium release assay while IL-2 activity was determined in a bioassay utilizing the IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cell line. Mice from the younger group were found to have eight-fold higher NK activity and 35% greater IL-2 production. After normalization of NK and IL-2 values for age, a highly statistically significant difference in NK activity was found among the four estrous and between the two circadian stages of sacrifice. NK activity was greater during the daily resting span across every estrous stage. IL-2 values were highest in diestrus and proestrus when sampled in the light span and in estrus-metestrus when sampled in the dark. The stages within the fertility cycle associated with lowest metastatic potential (proestrus/estrus) correspond precisely with those of highest splenocyte NK activity. These results indicate that an important component of the cellular immune response varies rhythmically both during the fertility and circadian cycles of the host. The rhythmic changes in NK activity may be in part responsible for the similarly rhythmic frequency of postsurgical metastatic dissemination.\r"

Regeneration in this severely damaged mammalian peripheral nerve model was quantitated by counting fluorescent antibody profiles to neurofilament protein distal to the lesion site. The results indicated that only cathodal current, applied distal to the lesion, significantly increased the rate of regeneration compared to controls. Such results help to elucidate mechanisms by which electric fields can facilitate regeneration in the mammalian nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about organ associated tumor response to systemic interleukin 2 (IL2) therapy. The effect of IL2 on bladder cancer growth in the skin and in the genitourinary tract was investigated. C3H mice were implanted with the syngeneic transitional cell carcinoma, MBT-2, intradermally (i.d.), beneath the left renal subcapsular area, and in one experiment, simultaneously in the bladder. IL2 (human recombinant form; Biogen Research Co) was given i.p. at 5000 U thrice daily for 5 consecutive days commencing on Day 3, or for 10 to 11 days commencing on Day 10 with some doses omitted at signs of toxicity. For comparison, mice bearing 3-d and 10-d tumors in the skin and subcapsular kidney were treated with chemotherapy (cisplatin, 6 mg./kg. X 3; mitomycin C, 3 mg./kg. X 3; cyclophosphamide, 75 mg./kg. X 1). IL2 therapy mediated growth suppression of 10-d tumors in the genitourinary organs and skin at a similar rate. In contrast to IL2, systemic chemotherapy mediated tumor suppression in an organ specific manner; renal subcapsular tumors responded to the chemotherapy, whereas i.d. tumors were insensitive. Three-day tumors (both i.d. and renal subcapsular tumor) responded relatively well to each treatment compared to 10-d tumors. These data suggest that in systemic immunotherapy with IL2, anatomic location of the tumor is less important for inducing an antitumor response than in chemotherapy.\r"

We investigated the functional activity of TIL compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Isolation of TIL was performed using the enzyme cocktail treatment with Ficoll-Hypaque discontinuous gradient centrifugation. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry demonstrated Leu 4, 43.6% (T cells); Leu 10, 10.5% (B cells) and Leu 7, 13.1% (natural killer (NK) cells) in TIL. The cytotoxic activity of TIL and PBL was tested in a four hour 51Cr-release assay. Myeloid K562 cells (NK sensitive), HT 1197 (bladder tumor) and fresh bladder tumors were used as target cells. The spontaneous NK cell activity of PBL was 23.7%, whereas that of TIL was only 3.5%. However, in vitro culture with IL2 induced a significant augmentation of NK activity in TIL as well as in PBL. On the other hand, the spontaneous lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK) activity of PBL and TIL was very low. IL2-cultured PBL and TIL exhibited the highest levels of lysis against fresh bladder tumors. Unlike PBL, IL2-induced cytotoxicity of TIL against autologous bladder tumors was higher than that against allogenic bladder tumors. Immunomodulators OK432 and Il2 were injected intratumorally during endoscopy. Analysis of the lymphocyte subsets in TIL showed an increase of T and NK cells following immunomodulator injection. Endoscopic injection of immunomodulators into bladder tumors augmented NK cell functional activity in TIL as well as PBL. These findings suggest that local immunosurveillance is directed against bladder tumors. Further studies are required to understand more fully the local and systemic host immune responses in cancer.\r"

Two hundred fifty-three patients in whom aortic prostheses have been inserted were observed for a mean of 46 months. Seventy-four bleeding episodes occurred in 21% of patients between 1 and 108 months after surgery (mean 29 months). Only one AEF appeared that was associated with GI bleeding, for an incidence of 1.4% of bleeding episodes and 0.4% of grafts inserted. No diagnostic workup for GI bleeding was performed for 20 of the 74 episodes and no AEFs were noted in this group during a mean follow-up of 28 months. Diagnostic evaluation was done for the remaining 54 episodes. No cause for bleeding was identified in 16 patients and no AEF developed in this group during a mean follow-up of 26 months. A potential bleeding site was identified in 38 patients, of whom 30 had intrinsic GI lesions and no subsequent evidence of AEF during a mean follow-up of 28 months. Laparotomy for a suspected AEF was recommended for the remaining eight episodes in eight patients and was performed in six patients. An AEF was seen in one patient with abnormality found on preoperative CT scanning; an intrinsic GI lesion was identified in three patients; and no pathologic condition was found in the remaining two (negative laparotomy rate, 33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Effects of postoperative infusion of a 3% amino acid solution on natural killer (NK) cell activity were studied in 10 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Eight additional patients formed the control group. Preoperative NK cell activity against K562 target cells determined in a short-term 51Cr release assay was similar in patients of both groups. After the operation, in general the patients of both groups showed a decrease in NK cell activity (p less than 0.01) but without differences between the groups. There were no changes in the percentages of Leu-7 positive cells (NK cells) between or within the two groups. However, the number of Leu-7 positive cells in blood was lower in the amino acid than in the control group patients during the postoperative days 3-7 (p less than 0.05 and 0.01). In vitro, the amino acid solution proved to be nontoxic both for effector and target cells and no depression of NK cell activity was observed. A 16-hr preincubation of mononuclear cells with the amino acid solution did not affect NK cell activity. The results suggest that postoperative infusion of an isotonic amino acid solution does not routinely offer any advantages over glucose containing electrolyte solution as to its effects on NK cell activity.\r"

Two studies were carried out in a hyperendemic zone of West Africa to test its specificity and usefulness as an epidemiological indicator for measuring malaria endemicity. The first study evaluated the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia before and after courses of antimalarial chemotherapy of varying duration. The second monitored haptoglobin levels in an untreated population during a whole year to compare its seasonal variations with those of several classic indicators of malaria. These studies suggest that in regions where malaria is endemic the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia could be as useful an indicator as the parasitic index but would be much easier to establish and to monitor.\r"

These features were compared with those of fourteen men with similar injuries who did not use an electrical stimulator. In men who did not use the stimulator, quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) at midthigh, measured by ultrasonography, fell by a mean (SD) 17 (10)% and the rate of muscle protein synthesis was 23 (10)% lower on the immobilised than on the control side (0.037 [0.016] vs 0.048 [0.02]%/h). In contrast, in those who used the stimulator, quadriceps CSA (55.5 [7.3]) cm2 control leg, 50.9 [9.0] cm2 immobilised leg) and the rate of muscle protein synthesis (0.053 [0.009] %/h control leg, 0.059 [0.012] %/h immobilised leg) were similar on the two sides. The results suggest that brief periods of low-voltage percutaneous electrical stimulation will reduce quadriceps atrophy secondary to knee immobilisation, and that the mechanism includes prevention of the fall in muscle protein synthesis that usually occurs on immobilisation.\r"

We describe a five-generation kindred, descendants of Sicilian immigrants, in which the disease occurs but without linkage to the alpha-hemoglobin complex. DNA probes were used in genetic-linkage studies on blood samples from 163 family members, of whom 71 were affected by or at risk for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasound examination. In this family the frequency of recombination between the alpha-hemoglobin complex and the region previously shown to contain the mutation causing polycystic kidney disease exceeded 24 percent, indicating a mutation at a different locus. The clinical findings in this family were indistinguishable from those in other families with polycystic kidney disease. We conclude that there is a second gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This apparent heterogeneity means that prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis must be approached with caution until a method is found to distinguish between the two forms of the disease.\r"

Microorganisms were isolated from the area between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). The most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were Ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and Gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). The recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). When multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). The proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. We conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.\r"

Varices were classified endoscopically as suggested by the Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension. Patients were followed for 1 to 38 months (median, 23), during which 85 patients (26.5 percent) bled. Multiple regression analysis (Cox's model) revealed that the risk of bleeding was significantly related to the patient's modified Child class (an index of liver dysfunction based on serum albumin concentration, bilirubin level, prothrombin time, and the presence of ascites and encephalopathy), the size of the varices, and the presence of red wale markings (longitudinal dilated venules resembling whip marks) on the varices. A prognostic index based on these variables was devised that enabled us to identify a subset of patients with a one-year incidence of bleeding exceeding 65 percent. The index was prospectively validated on an independent sample of 75 patients with varices and no history of bleeding. We conclude that our prognostic index, which identifies groups of patients with one-year probabilities of bleeding ranging from 6 to 76 percent, can be used to identify candidates for prophylactic treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Human CD4 is the receptor for the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus and is essential for virus entry into the host cell. Sequence analysis of CD4 has suggested an evolutionary origin from a structure with four immunoglobulin-related domains. Only the two NH2-terminal domains are required to mediate gp120 binding. The extracellular segment of murine CD4 has an overall 50% identity with its human counterpart at the amino-acid level, but fails to bind gp120. To define those residues of human CD4 critical for gp120 binding, we have taken advantage of this species difference and substituted all non-conserved murine for human CD4 residues between amino-acid positions 27-167. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to create each of 16 individual mutant human CD4 molecules containing from 1-4 amino-acid substitutions. Introduction of as few as three amino acids into corresponding positions of human CD4 abrogates gp120 binding. Furthermore, these critical residues are located in domain I with a contribution from domain II. Modelling studies using the three-dimensional coordinates of the V kappa Bence-Jones REI homodimer localize the site in domain I to the C\" beta strand within CDR2 but projecting away from the homologues of principle antigen-binding regions CDR 1 and 3.\r"

  ".U": "88334725\r", 
  ".W": "A common feature of follicular lymphoma, the most prevalent haematological malignancy in humans, is a chromosome translocation (t(14;18] that has coupled the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus to a chromosome 18 gene denoted bcl-2. By analogy with the translocated c-myc oncogene in other B-lymphoid tumours bcl-2 is a candidate oncogene, but no biological effects of bcl-2 have yet been reported. To test whether bcl-2 influences the growth of haematopoietic cells, either alone or together with a deregulated c-myc gene, we have introduced a human bcl-2 complementary DNA using a retroviral vector into bone marrow cells from either normal or E mu-myc transgenic mice, in which B-lineage cells constitutively express the c-myc gene. Bcl-2 cooperated with c-myc to promote proliferation of B-cell precursors, some of which became tumorigenic. To determine how bcl-2 expression impinges on growth factor requirements, the gene was introduced into a lymphoid and a myeloid cell line that require interleukin 3 (IL-3). In the absence of IL-3, bcl-2 promoted the survival of the infected cells but they persisted in a G0 state, rather than proliferating. These results argue that bcl-2 provided a distinct survival signal to the cell and may contribute to neoplasia by allowing a clone to persist until other oncogenes, such as c-myc, become activated.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell repertoire is elaborated by a still poorly understood process during which precursor cells arising in the bone marrow seed the thymus to provide a starting point for intrathymic differentiation and selection. The products of the process are cells which express antigen receptors composed of either alpha/beta or gamma/delta heterodimers in association with CD3. The finding that the appearance of T-cell antigen receptor gamma- and delta-gene rearrangements and transcripts precedes those of full-length beta- and alpha-transcripts during ontogeny indicates that the process is ordered, a conclusion supported by the fact that the appearance of thymocytes expressing CD3-associated gamma/delta heterodimers precedes the appearance of those bearing alpha/beta heterodimers. The recent demonstrations that within the gamma- and delta-loci there is ordered and sometimes transient rearrangement and expression of specific V delta and V gamma gene segments during ontogeny raised the possibility that qualitative changes in the capacity of the differentiative process to generate components of the T-cell armamentarium might occur. We have produced a monoclonal antibody that detects an epitope of the V gamma 3 gene product, a gene segment expressed only in the early fetal thymus. In this report we demonstrate that cells expressing V gamma 3 are present transiently at the earliest stages of thymocyte development, preceding the appearance of cells bearing other gamma/delta or alpha/beta receptors. In the adult mouse, V gamma 3 expression appears to be limited to Thy-1+ cells in the epidermis. These results suggest a profound programming and staging in elaboration of the components of the T-cell system during the early stages of thymocyte development in the embryo.\r"

In addition to discussing DISH and thoracic outlet syndrome, we readvocate the anterior approach for 1st rib resection that was introduced in 1967 by Gol and associates. The direct visualization offered by this approach allowed us to avoid a potential injury to the brachial plexus that may have occurred had the transaxillary approach been used.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically asymptomatic women with laboratory abnormalities in autoantibody profiles have recently been shown to experience reproductive failure. The evaluation of autoantibody panels and the establishment of normal cutoff values in clinically apparently healthy populations has therefore achieved increasing importance. Investigation of 400 clinically asymptomatic patients (200 females and 200 males) for the presence of autoantibodies to six phospholipids, five histone subfractions, and four polynucleotides revealed a nonparametric distribution of autoantibodies primarily for antiphospholipids and antihistone antibodies. This observation suggests that widely used parametric methods for the determination of normal autoantibody levels are inadequate and will give an unreasonably high incidence of abnormal results. Consequently, rather than the widely used 95% confidence interval, we used the 99% confidence interval (based on medians) to determine the upper limit of normal for various autoantibodies. This resulted in the detection of four to 13 positive patients (out of 400) per antigen, for a positivity rate of 1-3%. A more rigid definition of normal and abnormal autoantibody levels is essential to pursue accurately diagnostic and therapeutic considerations concerning the newly evolving concept of subclinically abnormal autoimmunity.\r"

We studied breast electrostimulation as a controllable method of initiating labor in 21 women. This technique successfully induced labor in 15 women, including all nine with premature rupture of membranes. The six (of 12) women without premature rupture of membranes who failed to go into labor each had a Bishop score of 4 or less. All of the successfully induced women delivered vaginally. The time interval from the start of stimulation to birth ranged from 2-13.5 hours, and all infants were born in good condition. Uterine hyperactivity occurred in five cases, but was controlled easily by adjusting the electrical variables of the stimulation. Further work will be needed to establish clearly the indications and safety of breast electrostimulation for induction of labor.\r"

In order to study the roles which dopamine and norepinephrine play in modulating opiate analgesia, the effects of amfonelic acid, an indirect dopamine agonist, and nisoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake blocker, were determined alone and in combination with morphine using this supraspinal model of analgesia. Amfonelic acid alone produced hyperalgesia and completely antagonized the analgesic effect of morphine. Nisoxetine had no effect by itself, however, it potentiated the analgesic effect of morphine when the two drugs were administered concomitantly. These findings suggest that norepinephrine and not dopamine plays a predominant role in the potentiation of opiate analgesia by D-amphetamine.\r"

In the present study, exogenous direct electric current was tested for its ability to promote growth of axons through a neuroma-like lesion. Neuroma-like structures were created by crushing rat sciatic nerves at two sites 4 mm apart and applying phenol to the intermediate region. A bulbous axonally impenetrable structure is formed 3 weeks later. At that time, silicone cuffs were sewn onto the nerve proximal to the phenol application site and 7 mm distally. In experimental groups, cuffs were attached to wires leading to a subcutaneously implanted Traxon power source, the distal cuff being cathodal. In control groups, cuffs were not electrically connected. In electrically active groups, substantial numbers of myelinated axons were seen distal to the cathode 3 weeks after implantation. Four times fewer fibers were observed in control groups. Footprint patterns from electrically active animals revealed a significant improvement over control neuroma preparations, as quantitated using the Sciatic Functional Index.\r"

Proviruses with mutations in the nef gene replicated better than their standard counterparts during transient expression, and the mutant virus maintained its enhanced replication even after serial passages in T lymphocytes. The nef protein trans-suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the replication of wild-type and nef mutant proviruses and the expression of reporter genes linked to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). The repression induced by the nef protein was mediated by inhibition of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR, which contains a far upstream cis element (previously recognized to be a negative regulatory element) between 340 and 156 nucleotides upstream of the RNA initiation site.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an important immunosuppressive drug that is widely used in transplantation medicine. Many of its suppressive effects on T cells appear to be related to the inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation events. Paradoxically, in certain situations CsA is responsible for the induction of a T cell-mediated autoimmunity. The effects of CsA on T cell development in the thymus were investigated to elucidate the physiologic events underlying this phenomenon. Two major effects were revealed: (i) CsA inhibits the development of mature single positive (CD4+8- or CD4-8+) TCR-alpha beta+ thymocytes without discernibly affecting CD4-8- TCR-gamma delta+ thymocytes and (ii) CsA interferes with the deletion of cells bearing self-reactive TCRs in the population of single positive thymocytes that do develop. This suggests a direct mechanism for CsA-induced autoimmunity and may have implications for the relative contribution of TCR-mediated signaling events in the development of the various T cell lineages.\r"

In contrast, the alpha 2 subunit is a hydrophilic protein without homology to other known protein sequences.

In these clinical situations, selective variceal decompression can be obtained with a splenocaval shunt, constructed by directly anastomosing the splenic vein to the infrarenal vena cava. Seven patients who have undergone the selective splenocaval shunt are reviewed in this report. Early experience with these patients demonstrates the use of the selective splenocaval shunt when an alternative to the distal splenorenal shunt is needed.\r"

The transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) in symptom free patients and patients with persistent generalised lymphadenopathy was normal (greater than 83% of predicted values). Patients with the AIDS related complex, non-pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, and non-pulmonary non-Kaposi sarcoma AIDS (that is, opportunist infections affecting other organs) had lower mean values for TLCO (77%, 70%, and 70% of predicted respectively). These values were significantly lower than values for symptom free patients. Lower mean values of 50% and 63% predicted TLCO were observed in patients during the acute and recovery phases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. TLCO was also low in patients with lung mycobacterial infection and in a patient with lung Kaposi sarcoma. Forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow, and maximal expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity were significantly reduced only in patients with acute pneumocystis pneumonia. This study shows that abnormalities in the results of pulmonary function tests, particularly TLCO, although greatest in patients with pulmonary complications of AIDS, are also present in patients with AIDS but without other evidence of pulmonary disease, and in patients with the AIDS related complex. The predictive and prognostic implications of these findings require further investigation.\r"

It has, however, been noted that T8 positive lymphocytes are also found on occasion in the granulomas. The presence of cells bearing markers associated with suppressor activity in various lesions of sarcoidosis has been investigated with a range of monoclonal antibodies. T4 positive cells were present in all granulomas; T8 positive lymphocytes were present within the epithelioid cell areas in proportions that varied from 5 to 55/100 of T4 cells. Other lymphocyte markers associated with suppression (Leu8 and SN130) were very rare on lymphocytes within granulomas but common on both T4 positive and T8 positive lymphocytes in the perigranulomatous mantle, which suggests that expression of these markers was down regulated in the granuloma or that cells bearing them are unable to migrate into the granuloma. Nevertheless, suppressor cell mechanisms could mediate the spontaneous resolution of most cases of sarcoidosis, and the presence or absence of cells bearing suppression associated phenotypes in the granuloma or its mantle may have prognostic importance.\r"

The Jarvik artificial heart implant is the one used most frequently. Intrathoracic complications related to its use were evaluated radiographically in seven patients undergoing implantation at our institution. Because of the relatively large size of the device, complications from compression of the left lung are common. Four of the seven patients had prolonged atelectasis of the left lower lobe and two had major vascular compression (pulmonary veins in the left lung in one and the inferior vena cava in another). Other chest complications were infection in the surgical site (three patients), mediastinal bleeding (one patient), and extensive fibrous adhesions around the device, making explantation difficult (one patient). All seven patients had pulmonary edema before surgery, which regressed over several days after surgery. Radiographs readily display the major components of the Jarvik heart and are valuable for detecting pulmonary complications associated with its use.\r"

The devices were passed through a 12-French Teflon catheter and positioned in the normal abdominal aorta of five dogs, two of which also had a device placed in an external iliac artery. At follow-up (1-6 months), all grafts remained patent, even though slight luminal narrowing due to neointimal encasement was noted. Histologically, all grafts were covered by neointimal proliferation at the time of removal. The graft material expanded with the stents, resulting in a tight fit between the graft and the vessel wall. Side branches narrowed but remained open because of the size of the nylon mesh. No migration of the grafts equipped with a barbed lead stent was noted. Expandable nylon mesh can be used as an endovascular graft material when wrapped around a framework of self-expanding stents. The resulting device can be easily delivered via transcatheter techniques, and once placed in a vessel, the nylon acts as a support for neointimal encasement, which forms a new vascular lumen.\r"

We then conducted a review of serially performed barium enemas to determine the percentage of patients with clean colons in a mixed population of 500 inpatients and outpatients in whom this regimen had been used. The same regimen also was used before single- and double-contrast barium enemas were performed in 139 patients with 234 polyps, and radiologic-endoscopic correlation was used to determine the percentage of polypoid neoplasms detected. The review indicated that a clean colon had been achieved in 97% of the 500 cases. In an additional 1.4% of patients, fecal residue was limited to small amounts in the cecum or ascending colon. In only two cases (0.4%) did fecal material prevent an examination that was suitable for detection of large polypoid or circumferential lesions. The single- and double-contrast barium enemas detected 80% and 91%, respectively, of polypoid lesions of all sizes. Single-contrast examinations detected 94% of polyps 10 mm or larger and 72% of polyps 5-9 mm. Double-contrast studies detected 96% of polyps 10 mm or larger and 88% of those 5-9 mm. The results of this study indicate that with this regimen, fecal residue does not significantly interfere with the detection of colonic polyps via barium enema examination.\r"

In seven cases, the bone response pattern was both lytic and blastic; in one case, it was purely lytic. Tumor matrix patterns were mostly homogeneous and cloudlike. Four of the lesions were expansile. All cases had cortical thinning and discontinuity. Extraosseous involvement of the soft tissues was present in six cases, and active periosteal response was present in two. High-grade malignancies subsequently developed in two patients--one was a local recurrence and the other was a distant metastasis. A broad spectrum of radiologic features was observed in well-differentiated intramedullary osteosarcomas, but all cases had at least two of three radiographic findings (cortical discontinuity, poorly marginated soft-tissue extension, or cloudlike tumor matrix pattern) that strongly suggested malignancy.\r"

We report five chronic alcoholic patients with neuroarthropathic alterations of the feet in whom coexistent diabetes mellitus was excluded by using laboratory methods that are more sensitive than those employed in previously reported series of alcoholic neuroarthropathy. The radiographic features of neuroarthropathy in our five cases consisted of hypertrophic changes at the tarsal joints in four, bony fragmentation at the tarsal and metatarsal regions in three, fracture dislocation at the tarsometatarsal joint in two, and multiple pathologic fractures in one. We conclude that alcoholism can result in neuroarthropathy in the absence of diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Recent concepts regarding surgical management of fractures of the glenoid and scapular neck provide a new imperative to their early recognition. The initial routine supine chest radiograph obtained in patients with major blunt chest trauma provides the earliest opportunity to identify scapular fractures. A retrospective analysis of 100 patients with major blunt chest trauma who were discharged with the diagnosis of scapular fracture was performed to determine (1) the frequency with which the diagnosis of scapular fracture was made on the initial chest radiograph and (2) the prevalence and type of regional injuries that could serve to identify which of these patients are most likely to have sustained scapular fracture(s). The scapular fracture was diagnosed on the initial chest radiograph in only 57 (57%) of 100 patients and, although present, was not recognized in 43 (43%) of 100. In the group in which the fractures were not recognized, the fracture was visible and frankly overlooked in 31 (72%) of 43. The fracture was not included on the examination in eight (19%) of 43; and it was obscured by superimposed structures or artifacts in four (9%) of 43. Ipsilateral regional injuries were present in 88 (88%) of 100. These included multiple upper rib fractures in 40 (40%), clavicular fractures in 17 (17%), acromioclavicular separation in six (6%), and \"other\" in 26 (26%). \"Other\" included subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and pulmonary contusion. The presence of ipsilateral regional skeletal injuries and soft-tissue injuries after major blunt chest trauma should prompt a diligent search for concomitant scapular fractures.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one symptomatic patients were studied with MR imaging to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of shoulder MR in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Correlative studies included arthroscopy in 19 patients and arthrography in 12 patients. Images were obtained on either a 0.5- or 1.5-T Philips superconducting magnet using spin-echo pulse sequences (650-850/30 [TR, TE], 2000/30, 100) with 5-mm slices oriented in an oblique coronal plane perpendicular to the glenohumeral joint. The MR studies were initially interpreted without knowledge of the results of other diagnostic procedures. The MR diagnosis of cuff tear was made when irregularity, discontinuity, and increased signal were identified in the rotator cuff. MR images showed tears in 10 patients (32%) and were negative for tear in 21 patients (68%). MR correlated with arthroscopy and arthrography in 17 of 18 normal patients, in eight of 10 patients with complete tears, and in one of three patients with partial tears. For complete rotator cuff tears, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 80%, 94%, and 89%, respectively. For all tears (partial and complete), the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 69%, 94%, and 84%, respectively. These data suggest that MR imaging is an accurate procedure for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears. The number of partial tears (three) in this series is too small to evaluate the value of MR imaging in the diagnosis of partial tears.\r"

  ".W": "The preoperative MR findings in 11 patients, all of whom had developed recurrent low back pain after surgery for herniated lumbar intervertebral disk, were correlated with the surgical findings to determine possible criteria for distinguishing recurrent disk herniation from postoperative scar (extradural fibrosis). The preoperative MR findings agreed with the surgical findings in seven of eight patients with recurrent disk herniation and in six of nine individuals with extradural fibrosis. The most important parameters in differentiating recurrent herniated disk from extradural scar were the configuration and margination of the extradural mass rather than its signal characteristics. The most reliable MR sign for recurrent herniated disk was the presence of a sharply marginated focal polypoid disk protrusion beyond the posterior margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies shown to best advantage on sagittal T1- and T2-weighted and axial T1-weighted spin-echo MR images. Disk herniations usually maintained isointensity with the intervertebral disk of origin, while extradural fibrosis exhibited variable signal intensity. The preoperative diagnosis of extradural fibrosis on MR was based primarily on its irregular configuration and extension. This study suggests that preoperative differentiation between scar and recurrent herniated disk is possible with MR when morphology and topography are considered in addition to signal intensity.\r"

Pan-necrosis occurred in 29 infants (20%) and was always fatal. The presence and degree of pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum and portal venous gas were studied. Pan-necrosis occurred least frequently in infants with mild or moderate pneumatosis intestinalis (8% and 12%, respectively), and with moderate frequency in those with pneumoperitoneum (33%). Pan-necrosis was found most frequently in infants with severe pneumatosis intestinalis (56%), portal venous gas (61%), or the combination of severe pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas (79%). The mortality rates in these three groups were 63%, 65%, and 86%, respectively. Thus, infants with the worst outcome (those who develop pan-necrosis) can be identified on plain films by detection of severe pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas.\r"

Fourteen patients had infections, 15 had tumors, and 15 had benign lymphoid hyperplasia. Deep cervical infections were caused by bacterial and mycobacterial organisms, including Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. Bacterial infections were clinically more virulent than they would be in immunocompetent patients. Neoplasms included Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Benign lymphoid hyperplasia demonstrated enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes, adenoids, and tonsils. Although there was considerable overlap in the imaging characteristics of the various diseases seen, several distinguishing features were noted. Cellulitis, with infiltration and thickening of the subcutaneous fat, was typical of bacterial infections, but was uncommon with tumors or mycobacterial infections. Lymph nodes with necrotic centers were seen with Kaposi sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and mycobacterial infection, but not with lymphoma or benign lymphoid hyperplasia. Benign adenoidal enlargement is usually symmetric with a flat anterior border, but bulky lesions indistinguishable from tumor were seen in two patients. It is important for radiologists to be aware of the spectrum of head and neck disease in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. The CT and MR assessment can guide biopsy and assist in planning therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88338455\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of high-resolution MR imaging (1.5 T) to detect invasion of the cavernous sinuses by pituitary adenoma was determined through a retrospective review of 74 patients. These patients were divided into three groups: 25 normal subjects, 24 subjects with invasive pituitary adenomas, and 25 subjects with noninvasive pituitary adenomas. A fourth group of 30 patients, who subsequently underwent surgery for pituitary adenoma, was evaluated prospectively by MR for the presence or absence of cavernous sinus invasion. Several features were analyzed: (1) the detectability of the medial and lateral dural margins of the cavernous sinus (2) the size and variation in intensity of compartments within the cavernous sinus (3) the relationship of endocrine function to the surgical and MR appearance of the cavernous sinus and (4) carotid artery displacement or encasement by tumor. The normal cavernous sinuses were usually symmetric, but their sizes varied. The lateral dural margin of the cavernous sinus was always recognized on MR as a linear, discrete, low-intensity area. The medial dural margin (pituitary capsule) was seen on MR in only two of the 25 normal patients. In all 24 patients with cavernous sinus invasion involvement was unilateral and was most common with laterally positioned prolactin or adrenocorticotropic hormone secretory adenomas. Invasion of the cavernous sinus was suspected by MR in only two of the 13 invasive microadenomas and was questionable in three. In 10 of the 11 macroadenomas with surgically proved dural invasion, MR demonstrated an asymmetric increase in size and intensity of the superior and inferior cavernous sinus compartments. Noninvasive macroadenomas compressed and displaced the cavernous sinus bilaterally. The prospective MR evaluation of 30 patients undergoing surgery for pituitary tumor revealed a sensitivity for predicting cavernous sinus invasion of 55%, a specificity of 85.7%, a positive predictive value of 62.5%, and a negative predictive value of 81.8%. No feature permitted certain distinction between invasive and noninvasive microadenomas, as the medial dural wall of the cavernous sinus could not be reliably identified. The most specific sign of cavernous sinus invasion was carotid artery encasement.\r"

The localizing system consisted of a 20-gauge plastic sheath into which a stainless-steel alloy wire had been inserted. In laboratory studies, we compared this wire-sheath assembly with other materials to determine its optimal visualization on MR images. We then used the same wire-sheath system to perform 16 procedures (in 10 patients), including six biopsies, five diagnostic fluid aspirations, and five catheter drainages of infected and noninfected fluid collections. The laboratory results showed that the wire-sheath assembly cast a 7-mm artifact, was visualized well on all pulse sequences, and was safe within the magnet (minimal attraction). The assembly was visualized well in each patient and provided adequate localization. MR-guided biopsy and drainage can be performed with high-resolution detail by using this wire-sheath system. Potential uses of this system include (1) treatment of lesions that can be seen on MR images only (or that can be seen to significantly better advantage on MR images than on sonograms or CT scans), and (2) treatment of patients in whom avoidance of the radiation delivered by CT is imperative.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenal arterial embolization was performed in nine patients, four with inoperable adrenal cortical carcinoma and five with metastatic adrenal tumors. Embolic agents used were polyvinyl alcohol foam (Ivalon) in seven patients, stainless steel coils in four, ethanol in three, and surgical gelatin (Gelfoam) in two. In eight patients, embolization was performed for palliation, either to decrease tumor bulk (all patients), suppress tumor hormonal function (three patients), or relieve pain (four patients). One patient had an embolization to facilitate subsequent adrenalectomy. In four patients in whom it was possible to assess the effect of embolization on tumor bulk by follow-up CT, a striking reduction in size has occurred in one, the lesions remained stable in size for 12 months in two, and the tumor continued to increase in size in the fourth. A striking reduction in the production of the cortisol for 12 months was seen in two of three patients with Cushing syndrome. This reduction was considered due at least in part to embolization. Adrenal embolization resulted in effective palliation of pain in three of four patients and may have contributed to palliation in the fourth. Apart from a hypertensive episode in one patient, the cause of which was unclear, no serious side effects occurred. Adrenal arterial embolization may play an effective role without serious side effects in palliation of pain and reduction of hormone production in inoperable adrenal lesions.\r"

The procedure appeared sound physiologically and since 1976, the distal splenorenal shunt has been our procedure of choice for both emergency and elective situations. Our series of 43 patients included 6 patients in Child's class A, 18 in Child's class B, and 19 in Child's class C. The operative mortality rate was 4.7 percent (2 of 43 patients) and there were 34 long-term survivors (79 percent). Use of modern cardiovascular techniques is an essential facet of the surgeon's technical ability to achieve low morbidity and mortality rates. In the present series, the average blood loss was 440 ml and the average operative time, 2 1/2 hours. The distal splenorenal shunt can be performed for emergency and elective therapy of bleeding esophageal varices with a low incidence of complications and death and excellent long-term quality of life.\r"

Both techniques were found to be acceptable in clinical practice. Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed by the time taken to reach clinically-defined milestones. Times to open eyes, give name, stand unaided, and time to discharge were all 3 to 7 minutes shorter in those who had the propofol technique compared with those who had thiopentone-halothane (p less than 0.05).

One hundred and twenty children who were to undergo elective surgery were included in the study. Both propofol and thiopentone produced a rapid and smooth induction with a low incidence of side effects. A similar decrease (10%) in mean arterial pressure was observed with both agents, but propofol showed better suppression of the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Respiratory upsets occurred less frequently with propofol than with thiopentone, but propofol frequently induced discomfort on injection. Both agents provided satisfactory and controllable induction of anesthesia and no major adverse reactions occurred during or after anaesthesia. We conclude that propofol is a useful alternative as an induction agent in children.\r"

  ".W": "Using gated radionuclide ventriculography and invasive cardiac monitoring, the effects of propofol alone and in combination with fentanyl on left ventricular (LV) volumes and function were investigated in 10 ASA III, unpremedicated patients (51-75 years) with coronary artery disease (NYHA II-III). Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg) followed by an infusion (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Vecuronium (0.05 mg/kg) was administered and ventilation (FIO2, 1.0) was manually controlled via a face mask (FECO2, 4-5%). Data acquisitions were serially obtained over 15 minutes after the bolus IV injection of propofol and 5 minutes after the injection of fentanyl (5 micrograms/kg). Propofol induced a rapid decrease (15%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) exclusively related to a decrease in cardiac index (CI), without reduction in indexed systemic vascular resistances (SVRI). Despite the decrease in MAP, heart rate did not change. The decrease in CI was associated with a lower preload. After the addition of fentanyl, MAP decreased significantly (35%) below the last set of propofol measurements. The decrease in MAP was associated with a reduction in CI and SVRI. Fentanyl was also associated with a significant decrease in heart rate (16%) resulting in a decrease in CI, whereas stroke index and end diastolic volume did not change. Neither global ejection fraction (EF) nor end systolic volume changed significantly at any time, nor were there changes in the ECG or in regional ejection fractions (REF). The absence of changes in REF was consistent with lack of wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. Propofol alone and in combination with fentanyl does not alter LV performance in patients with good LV function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Actual survival time compared with arrhythmia-free time in a single group of patients. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center and outpatient follow-up. PATIENTS: Seventy consecutive patients with clinical sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation whose arrhythmia could not be controlled by medication as determined by programmed electrical stimulation, and who had an automatic cardioverter defibrillator implanted. INTERVENTION: All patients received an implantable defibrillator. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two-year survival was 93.4% (95% CI, 87 to 99.8) and projected survival based on recurrence of malignant arrhythmias was 60.3% (CI, 47.3 to 73.3; P less than 0.001). In the 25 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%, actual survival was 86.7% (CI, 72.3 to 91.1) and projected survival was 56.9% (CI, 35.9 to 77.9; P = 0.025). Projected survival percentages are similar to survival figures reported in the literature for such high-risk patients. There was only one sudden death; the remaining deaths were not arrhythmic in nature. Of the 65 patients who were alive at the end of follow-up, 13 were in New York Heart Association Class I; 44, Class II; 5, Class III; and 3, Class IV. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator is probably highly effective in preventing arrhythmic mortality even in high-risk patients. Such treatment does not appear to significantly impair a patient's functional status.\r"

PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 21 patients with tropical spastic paraparesis associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Chest roentgenogram and bronchoalveolar lavage were done in all patients. Fifteen patients had pulmonary function tests. Alveolar T-lymphocyte subsets were analysed in 10 patients and thoracic computed tomographic scans were done in 10 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients were free of clinical pulmonary symptoms and had normal chest roentgenograms. Thoracic computed tomographic scans were normal in 9 of 10 patients and showed mild interstitial pneumonitis in 1. Pulmonary function tests were within the normal range in 13 patients and showed a mild restrictive syndrome in 2. Eighteen patients had increased absolute numbers of alveolar lymphocytes (mean, 77 +/- 39 X 10(3) lymphocytes/mL; range, 13.5 X 10(3) to 259 X 10(3) lymphocytes/mL). Sixteen patients had percentages of alveolar lymphocytes higher than 20% of all alveolar cells (mean, 33.5 +/- 12.7; range, 9 to 69). In all 10 patients tested, 64.2% +/- 13.2% of alveolar lymphocytes were CD8+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive absolute numbers and percentages of alveolar lymphocytes were observed in 18 and 16 patients, respectively. Most alveolar lymphocytes were CD8+ cells.\r"

DESIGN: We developed a comprehensive and clinically detailed list of 1069 indications for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. A national panel of nine clinicians rated the appropriateness of the indications. We categorized the indications as appropriate, inappropriate, or equivocal. We did a clinically detailed medical record review of a random sample of 1585 patients having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to assess the appropriateness of using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. SETTING: Patients were sampled from large geographic areas in three states. Two areas represented high use, and one area, low use. PATIENTS: Random sample of patients 65 years of age or older receiving diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: None; the study was retrospective. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Patient characteristics, histories, and clinical indications for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were similar across low- and high-use areas. Overall, 72% of the endoscopies were done for appropriate indications, 11% for equivocal indications, and 17% for inappropriate indications. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (26%), follow-up to an abnormal upper gastrointestinal series (21%), dysphagia (18%), and dyspepsia (15%) were the most frequent clinical reasons for doing endoscopy. Inpatient endoscopies were more often appropriate and less often inappropriate than outpatient endoscopies. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of practice patterns among study sites provides the clinical basis for understanding the use of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The finding of 17% inappropriate use may be cause for concern.\r"

The tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius-soleus muscle groups were stimulated bilaterally, using 50 microsecond pulses given at 10Hz with a four-second \"on\" and an eight-second \"off\" cycle for 23 hours daily over a 28-day period. Forty-eight patients, less than two weeks after injury, were randomly assigned to saline placebo (n = 17), low-dose heparin (5,000U, subcutaneous every eight hours) (n = 16), and low-dose heparin plus electric stimulation (n = 15). A normal 125-I fibrinogen scan and impedance plethysmography were required for entry into the study. Surveillance for DVT was evaluated by daily 125-I fibrinogen scanning. Venography was performed to confirm a positive impedance plethysmography and/or 125-I fibrinogen scanning tests for two consecutive days and at the completion of the study. The incidence of DVT was 8 of 17 in the placebo group, 8 of 16 in the low-dose heparin group, and 1 of 15 in the electric stimulation plus low-dose heparin group. The use of electric stimulation plus low-dose heparin significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased the incidence of DVT compared to the other treatments.\r"

Nineteen subjects two to ten years postinjury, with clinically complete motor and sensory lesions between C4 and T10, participated. All subjects met the specific selection criteria. None had received lower extremity electrical stimulation before. In phase I, subjects received surface electrical stimulation to the quadriceps muscle bilaterally for resistive knee extension 3 times a week for four weeks. The resistance and number of completed lifts was recorded daily. In phase II, 36 sessions provided sequential surface electrical stimulation to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles bilaterally in order for subjects to pedal a lower extremity ergometer with resistance varied depending on completed run time. For each session, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and work performance were recorded. Tests done before and after the training program included fasting blood chemistries, 24-hour urinalysis, arm-crank ergometer stress testing, and midthigh girth measurement. Results indicate that this form of FES is safe, that quadriceps strength and endurance is increased, that endurance for ergometer pedaling is increased, and that there may be a training effect as more work is done at a similar heart rate and systolic blood pressure and as muscle bulk is increased. The FES effect on cardiovascular conditioning and general health requires further research to precisely determine its benefits.\r"

  ".U": "88122546\r", 
  ".W": "The gonads and adrenal glands produce steroids classified into five major groups which include the oestrogens, progestins, androgens, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Gonadal steroids control the differentiation and growth of the reproductive system, induce and maintain sexual characteristics and modulate reproductive behaviour. Adrenal steroids also influence differentiation as well as being metabolic regulators. The effects of each steroid depend primarily on its specific receptors, the nature of which could therefore provide a basis for classification of steroid hormone action. The successful cloning, sequencing and expression of the human glucocorticoid (hGR) (ref. 1), oestrogen (hER), progesterone (hPR), and mineralocorticoid (hMR) receptors, complementary DNA, plus homologues from various species, provides the first opportunity to study receptor structure and its influence on gene expression. Sequence comparison and mutational analysis show structural features common to all groups of steroid hormone receptors. The receptors share a highly conserved cysteine-rich region which functions as the DNA-binding domain. This common segment allows the genome to be scanned for related gene products: hMR cDNA for example, was isolated using an hGR hybridization probe. In this study, using the DNA-binding domain of the human oestrogen receptor cDNA as a hybridization probe, we have isolated two cDNA clones encoding polypeptides with structural features suggestive of cryptic steroid hormone receptors which could participate in a new hormone response system.\r"

There was a correlation between parental origin and parental age, with the Xp category having a significantly reduced mean maternal age by comparison with the Xm group.

EDF is a homodimer with a Mr of 25,000; the Mr of the monomer is 15,500. cDNA clones encoding the Mr 15,500 subunit of EDF from THP-1 libraries were isolated and sequenced. Surprisingly, the sequence of EDF mRNA is identical to that for the beta A subunit of inhibin, a gonadal protein that suppresses the secretion of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone. Southern blot analysis indicates that only one gene for EDF/inhibin beta A exists in the human genome. When the EDF subunit cDNA was linked to a simian virus 40 expression vector containing the dihydrofolate reductase gene and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary dihydrofolate reductase negative cells, the transformants began to secrete EDF, demonstrating that the cDNA actually encoded the EDF subunit.\r"

To determine whether the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) localized at 13q14, might be the target of recessive mutations in lung cancer, eight primary SCLC tumors and 50 cell lines representing all major histologic types of lung cancer were examined with the Rb complementary DNA probe. Structural abnormalities within the Rb gene were observed in 1/8 (13%) primary SCLC tumors, 4/22 (18%) SCLC lines, and 1/4 (25%) pulmonary carcinoid lines (comparable to the 20 to 40% observed in retinoblastoma), but were not detected in other major types of lung cancer. Rb messenger RNA expression was absent in 60% of the SCLC lines and 75% of pulmonary carcinoid lines, including all samples with DNA abnormalities. In contrast, Rb transcripts were found in 90% of non-SCLC lung cancer lines and in normal human lung. The finding of abnormalities of the Rb gene in SCLC and pulmonary carcinoids (both neuroendocrine tumors) suggests that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of a common adult malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the sequence of a mutant CYP21B gene isolated from a patient with the severe, \"salt-wasting\" form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Codon 318 in this gene is changed from CAG, encoding glutamine, to TAG, a nonsense codon. This is predicted to result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme due to premature termination of translation. In addition, when the cloned mutant gene was transfected into mouse Y1 adrenal cells, the resulting mRNA levels were decreased compared with transfected normal CYP21B genes. This mutation was carried by 3 of 20 unrelated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles as determined by hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe. This mutation is also seen in the normal CYP21A pseudogene, so that its presence in the abnormal CYP21B gene may be the result of a gene conversion event.\r"
