  ".W": "There is now considerable evidence in favor of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as a neurotransmitter of nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerves in the airways. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the influence of inhaled VIP on bronchomotor tone after a beta-adrenergic- and cholinergic-receptor blockage. The study was performed in six patients with asthma in 4 days. On the first day, a propranolol provocative dose producing a 20% change in FEV1 (PD20) was determined from the individual semilogarithmic dose-response curve. On the other days, the propranolol challenge was performed after inhalation of ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms), VIP (70 micrograms), and both drugs in randomized double-blind order. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance. The results demonstrated that mean propranolol PD20 was 0.14 mg (geometric mean + SD = 1.22). Ipratropium bromide administration, like VIP administration, significantly raised the PD20 value. The administration of both drugs elicited a further remarkable increase of mean propranolol PD20. The results demonstrated that inhaled VIP influences bronchomotor tone and that this effect is independent of the cholinergic blockage.\r"

As demonstrated with certain occupational chemicals, we proposed that MBS might conjugate with human proteins, such as human serum albumin, and then cause an immunologic response. Because we had identified no reactions to MBS at the Northwestern Allergy Service, we used sera from four patients reported elsewhere as having positive skin tests and positive oral challenges to sulfites. We attempted to demonstrate, both in vitro by ELISA and in vivo by passive cutaneous transfer to monkey, evidence for IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to MBSs. Our results demonstrated that there is evidence of IgE antibody by passive transfer for one patient studied, but no evidence of IgE antibody by ELISA to an MBS-albumin conjugate in any of the four patients. This study illustrates the complexities involved in the evaluation and mechanism of MBS-induced disease and the caution with which results must be interpreted.\r"

The evaluation consisted of periodic serum antibody studies and a questionnaire that was designed to attempt to identify symptoms compatible with work-related syndromes of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asthma, or irritant reactions. The study population was divided into seven groups on the basis of job classification. The groups differed in exposure levels but were similar in terms of age, sex, smoking history, and duration of work with isocyanates. IgE and IgG against HDI and THDI conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) (HDI-HSA and THDI-HSA) were determined by ELISA. There were no instances of immunologically induced disease among the 21% of workers in this sample with antibody; however, there is insufficient evidence at this time to make judgments about the relationship between antibody and clinical disease. The antibody was generally low-level IgG that may be a sensitive indicator to detect exposure to certain reactive chemicals. The level of antibody was not different among job classes or between smokers and nonsmokers. Moreover, there was no correlation between antibody level and exposure duration in these workers whose exposure levels are all well below National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations. Further evaluation will extend these observations.\r"

To evaluate this question, we studied two groups of children aged 2 to 17 years. The first group consisted of 100 children selected from a general pediatric group practice. These children were being observed for well-child care, and the only selection criteria were the need for a venous blood sample for a reason unrelated to the study. The second group of 91 patients were consecutively referred, from the same pediatric group, for allergy evaluation because of respiratory tract symptoms. Parental smoking histories were obtained, and total serum IgE, IgD, and IgE specific for cat, dog, mite, ragweed, grass, and cockroach were measured by ELISA. Children of smoking mothers had significantly greater IgD concentrations (p = 0.03) and were more likely to be referred for allergy evaluation (p = 0.0001), but these children did not have increased concentrations of total or allergen-specific IgE. Exposed children were not more likely to be serologically sensitive to any of the allergens tested. We conclude that children passively exposed to cigarette smoke do not produce more IgE to common allergens nor are they more likely to produce IgE to any particular allergen.\r"

  ".U": "89009353\r", 
  ".W": "Eight subjects with asthma inhaled on separate occasions leukotriene E4 (LTE4) (6.1 nmol, geometric mean), methacholine, and diluent, which produced an average 41.0%, 37.0%, and 3.3% decrease in specific airway conductance (SGaw), respectively. When the SGaw had recovered to baseline levels at 60 minutes after challenge, the provocative dose of inhaled histamine that produced a 35% decrease in SGaw (PD35) was determined. The histamine PD35 observed after inhalation of LTE4 was 0.46 mumol, and this was significantly less than the histamine PD35 observed after inhalation of methacholine (0.88 mumol; p less than 10(-4) and diluent (0.97 mumol; p less than 10(-5). Histamine responsiveness was also enhanced by a fiftyfold lower dose of LTE4 (p = 0.005), and the enhancement was less than that elicited by the higher dose of LTE4 in the same individuals (p = 0.02). The changes in histamine PD35 during a 1-week period after LTE4 and methacholine challenges were compared in four subjects with asthma. There was a time-dependent enhancement in histamine responsiveness that reached a maximal of 3.5-fold at 7 hours after LTE4. The enhancement had disappeared by 1 week. Similar changes were not observed after methacholine challenge, which elicited the same degree of bronchoconstriction as LTE4. Inhalation of LTE4 in five normal subjects that produced a mean 37.6% decrease in SGaw did not change histamine responsiveness for up to 7 hours. These findings suggest that LTE4 may play a role in the perpetuation of nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness in bronchial asthma.\r"

EO-specific IgG antibodies were, however, also found in sera from hemodialysis patients without any hypersensitivity symptoms. Assay of specific IgG antibodies will only indicate whether a patient has been exposed to, and immunostimulated by, EO, whereas specific IgE antibodies appear to be clearly related to hypersensitivity symptoms. The hapten and carrier specificity of EO-induced IgE antibodies was studied. The antibodies were found to be solely hapten specific because carriers of different types could be used in RAST without changing the outcome of the test. The existence of new antigenic determinants related to the carrier could not be demonstrated.\r"

No significant differences between women with asthma using inhaled bronchodilators and subjects not receiving inhaled bronchodilators were found in the following parameters: perinatal mortality, congenital malformations, preterm births, low birth weight infants, mean birth weight, small for gestational age or low ponderal index infants, Apgar scores, labor/delivery complications, or postpartum bleeding. Increased incidences of maternal chronic and pregnancy-induced hypertension and transient tachypnea of the neonate were observed in the pregnancies of subjects with asthma using regular inhaled bronchodilators compared to control subjects, but a logistic regression analysis within the sample of subjects with asthma did not significantly associate the use of inhaled bronchodilators with these outcomes. In the light of the known substantial perinatal risks of severe, uncontrolled asthma and the relatively sparse evidence of human gestational safety for alternative asthma medications, these data support the use of inhaled beta-agonist bronchodilators as part of the management of asthma during pregnancy.\r"

Postoperatively, the overall incidence of pulmonary complications (either pulmonary infection or asthma) was 9.7%. Three patients developed pneumonia, demonstrated by an infiltrate on chest x-ray examination, and two patients developed wheezing requiring epinephrine, giving a complication rate of 5.4%. In addition, four patients developed mild wheezing postoperatively. Statistical analyses to compare the overall infection rate in this asthmatic population with that in two other surgical populations showed no statistical differences. There were no deaths and no patient developed any wound complication or adrenocortical insufficiency. These results indicate that patients with asthma in optimal respiratory condition who have received preoperative clinical evaluation and a hydrocortisone pretreatment regimen can undergo surgery with minimal complications.\r"

Intelligence test scores were also related to phenylalanine levels between ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 years.

Of particular interest was the pattern of macronutrient consumption, since the proportion of fat and type of fat in the diet is thought to be related to the development of chronic disease. Estimates of nutrient intake were based on 24-hour dietary recalls, while information on education was obtained through interview. Educational attainment was positively associated with nutrient consumption patterns that may decrease risk of chronic disease for both men and women. For women, the proportion of dietary fat was less (p = .03) and carbohydrate greater (p = .004) with increasing education. For men, the Keys dietary score decreased as education increased (p = .05) (high scores indicate greater blood cholesterol-raising effect of the diet). Inverse associations of average total serum cholesterol level with education in both men (p = .02) and women (p = .06) support these dietary associations. These results suggest that educational attainment is related positively to eating patterns that may carry a decreased risk of cardiovascular and other chronic disease. Whether or not this association is causal, it would appear to point to a need for more effective nutrition education strategies for those with less education.\r"

Subjects were placed into study groups of high-, moderate-, and low-fortifiers on the basis of frequency of intake of highly fortified foods (FF-SI) which, unlike FF + SI, are not staple foods and may represent selective dietary nutrient addition by the consumer. For all groups, mean intakes of riboflavin, niacin, and vitamins A and C were greater than 100% of the RDAs without nutrient addition. Mean thiamin intake met the RDA only when the nutrient addition from FF + SI was included. Mean intakes of iron, calcium, and vitamin D were all below the RDA even when all sources of intake were included. No significant differences between study groups were found for total nutrient intake. With the exceptions of vitamin C, vitamin D, and calcium, high- and moderate-fortifiers had significantly greater (p less than .01) nutrient intake from fortification.

Educators responded that forecasting was an important concept and that continuing education concerning forecasting techniques that may be employed in foodservice management was needed. As a result of the analysis of the data, two self-instructional modules that could be utilized by both practitioners and educators to enhance the level of practice and education were developed. Graduate and undergraduate students at 11 universities and 35 randomly selected practitioners tested the self-instructional modules. For all groups--undergraduate, graduate, and practitioners--the t-statistic was significant at the p less than .0000 level; thus the modules were effective in teaching foodservice forecasting concepts.\r"

The guidelines represent the Expert Panel's conclusions on appropriate ways to interpret dietary data relating to (a) prevalence of consumption of particular levels of foods or food components, (b) comparisons of intake of different groups within the U.S. population, (c) time trends in consumption of foods or food components, and (d) relationships of intake of a food or food component to a given health outcome. The guidelines address general issues concerning dietary data collection and statistical concerns as well as specific issues important in interpretation of dietary data.\r"

The system operates interactively, soliciting all necessary information on menu selection screens to ensure user entry of complete food descriptions and quantity information. The descriptive data are then automatically converted to food codes and gram weights for subsequent calculation of nutrient content. At the completion of the first phase of system development, a preliminary test was performed to compare the amount of time required to enter food intake data into the DDC system with the amount of time required to accomplish the same food coding task manually. Test subjects consisted of four experienced food coders and one coder trainee. Using a crossover design, each coder manually coded 16 1-day food records and entered another 16 records into the DDC system for automatic coding. Four of the five coders took significantly less time to code and enter descriptive dietary intake information using the DDC system than they took for manual coding and data entry. Time savings ranged between 9% and 44% among the test subjects.\r"

It is also an essential evidentiary tool in malpractice suits. Even though the medical record is not the sole information upon which the courts will rely in determining negligence liability, it can serve as an important chronology of care. Dietitians entering private practice, whether with a physician or not, should establish a system of record keeping. Although specific standards have not been set for private patient records, it is argued that records kept must meet many of the requisite guidelines for medical records in institutional settings. Additionally, the records must provide documentation that may be absent and difficult to obtain in the private setting. Discussed are legal issues surrounding patient records of the dietitian in private practice.\r"

Activities that constitute key nutrition services need to be accentuated to clarify the numerous skills and extensive knowledge that dietitians possess. In the health care system of today, the dietetic profession must be associated with a wider range of health-related tasks than the traditional triad of diet, food, and hospital. Public relations and marketing strategies should focus on activities that provide the public with a clearer understanding of how the dietetic profession contributes to patient/client care.\r"

The absence of an age effect for breast cancer patients is in contrast to earlier research findings that identify a positive association between extent of disease and age at diagnosis.

The results showed that 55% of major caregivers, primarily spouses, living with an older relative with dementia experienced clinical depression. Depressed caregivers were more likely to perceive a lack of control over their situation than those who were not depressed. Contrary to the reformulated learned helplessness hypothesis, they did not perceive their situation to be the result of internal, stable, and global attributions. The results suggest the need to study depression in ecologically stressful natural settings and to develop effective clinical intervention strategies.\r"

  ".W": "An association between depression and physical dependency arising from a recent illness has been generally accepted. To clarify this relationship over time, 30 medical rehabilitation patients aged 54 to 94 years were assessed 1 week after admission and at discharge to quantify symptoms of depression, physical dependency, and cognitive functioning using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Barthel Index for physical function, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Significant depressive symptomatology was found by HAM-D in 25 patients on admission and 14 on discharge. No significant associations were present between either admission or discharge depression scores and all other variables. The HAM-D change score was significantly correlated with the Barthel change score (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001) and with the MMSE change score (r = 0.48, P = 0.01). All patients whose mood improved also improved in physical functioning, whereas 75% of those whose mood did not improve failed to make headway in physical functioning. This implies that it is not the degree of physical incapacity but rather the failure to regain prior abilities which is strongly associated with persisting depression following a catastrophic illness. Furthermore, characteristics found commonly in the group whose mood did not improve included physicians' failure to diagnose and treat depression or a setback from a significant medical or surgical complication.\r"

All individuals 65 and older able to give informed consent (73 patients) who were admitted to one medical floor of an acute care hospital were randomized to one of three groups. All groups received informational pamphlets explaining influenza and pneumococcal disease, their respective vaccines, and indications for their use. The first group received pamphlets only, the second received nursing follow-up, and the third received trained volunteer follow-up. Patients on another medical floor served as controls. The results showed a significant improvement in vaccine acceptance in all three study groups compared to controls for both influenza (78% vs 0%) and pneumococcal (75% vs 0%) vaccines. The differences among the three groups were not significant. No significant differences were found among patients accepting or refusing vaccination with regard to diagnosis, age, length of stay, sex, or having a private physician. We conclude that a simple educational program followed by offering vaccination before hospital discharge can be easily implemented, and dramatically increase immunization rates in this high risk group.\r"

Thirty-three percent of the fracture patients were taking diuretics compared with 24% of the controls (.10 greater than P greater than .05). Forty-six percent of these diuretics taken by the fracture group (compared with 40% taken by the controls) were either loop or potassium sparing diuretics in combination with another diuretic. Twenty-five percent of the controls (compared with 9% of the fracture patients) were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (P less than .001). The greater use of NSAIDs by control subjects may be due to the small overlap between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. No significant differences were found for digoxin, anti-hypertensive drugs, and those taking no drugs. Thirty percent of fracture patients were taking sedatives and hypnotics compared with 28% of controls. Within this category, 54% of the fracture patients and 80% controls were receiving drugs (mainly benzodiazepines) with half-lives longer than 24 hours. Thus, this population did not confirm a previously identified association between long-acting sedatives and the risk of fracture. As only 3.5% of fracture patients and 2.1% controls were receiving phenothiazines, a role for these drugs in hip fracture cannot be ruled out. In summary, hip fracture patients were slightly more likely to be taking diuretics and somewhat less likely to be taking NSAIDs than controls but there were no differences with respect to other drugs.\r"

This study compares a new intranasal preparation of salmon calcitonin to subcutaneous drug in 18 patients with Paget's disease using two different protocols. In the first protocol, 15 patients not previously treated with salmon calcitonin were given the agent for 3 months by either the intranasal or subcutaneous route. Seven patients treated with intranasal calcitonin had a mean fall in the serum alkaline phosphatase of 33% over a 3-month period compared to a fall of 40% in the subcutaneously treated group; the difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. In the second protocol, three patients previously stabilized on subcutaneous calcitonin were switched to the nasal spray with no subsequent change in alkaline phosphatase values during 6 months of treatment. These results demonstrate that intranasal salmon calcitonin is effective in lowering the serum alkaline phosphatase in Paget's disease. Ease of administration and patient acceptance make intranasal calcitonin a reasonable alternative for geriatric patients.\r"

These volunteers were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 443) and placebo (n = 108) groups. The behavioral assessments at baseline and 1 year later were the SHORT-CARE instrument for depression, cognitive impairment, and disability and other tests of cognitive status (Digit Symbol Substitution and the Trail Making tests). Although the treatment regime was highly successful in controlling the hypertension, it did not have a significant impact on changes in cognitive function or level of depression; a behavioral benefit was not evident but the results are consistent with the view that an effective treatment regime for isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly can be behaviorally safe.\r"

The independently significant multivariate correlates of the development of coronary heart disease after the age of 65 were sex (incidence rate ratio [RR] for males of 1.7 [95% confidence interval of 1.4,2.0]), left ventricular hypertrophy (RR = 2.4 [1.7,3.5]), systolic blood pressure (RR = 2.2 [1.4,3.3] for systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher as compared with less than 120 mmHg), casual blood glucose (RR = 2.2 [1.5,3.4] for 175 mg/dL or more as compared with less than 90 mg/dL), Metropolitan relative weight from examination 1 (RR = 1.3 [1.0,1.6] for those 130% or more of ideal weight compared with those less than 110% of ideal), and total serum cholesterol (RR = 1.8 [1.3,2.5] for cholesterol in the 90th percentile or higher compared with less than 200 mg/dL). Controlling for all these risk factors, those smoking 20 cigarettes a day or more were at slightly increased risk of coronary heart disease (RR = 1.2 [.9,1.6]) compared with nonsmokers. These analyses suggest that older persons share the same risk factors for coronary artery disease that are significant in younger populations.\r"

  ".W": "Falls are a leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among the elderly in the United States. Despite the importance of fall injuries, epidemiological studies of falls among the elderly have identified neither their causes nor the methods to prevent them. Therefore, we established a community-based surveillance system in Miami Beach, Florida, as part of a study to assess falls among the elderly. A total of 1,827 fall injury events occurred in this community between July 1985 and June 1986. More than 85% (1,567) of the persons who fell and received care were seen in an emergency room. The remaining cases were identified from one of the three other sources used: fire rescue reports, inpatient medical records, or medical examiner reports. Most falls (97%) were coded as accidental (E880-E888). More than 100 people sought medical assistance for a fall each month. The time of the injury was known for 68% (1,244) of the people who fell. Seventy-four percent of these falls (921) occurred during daylight hours. Fifty-four percent of the falls (986) occurred in and around the home, and 38% of these had a particular area of the home recorded: 42% occurred in the bedroom, 34% in the bathroom, 9% in the kitchen, 5% on the stairs, 4% in the living room, and the remaining 6% in other areas. This surveillance system will help us use the study to clarify the causes of falls in the elderly and identify and evaluate appropriate prevention efforts. It will also help others in designing and implementing other injury surveillance systems.\r"

Thirteen patients (29%) survived 2 months or longer after dialysis treatment (\"survivors\"). Thirty-one patients (71%) died within this period (\"nonsurvivors\"). The main factor distinguishing survivors was the frequency of sepsis (none of 13 survivors vs 17 of 31 nonsurvivors). Preexisting malignancy and total number of acute insults to renal function were significantly less frequent, and immediate clinical and biochemical outcome of dialysis significantly better in survivors. The overall complication rate of dialysis was high (31 of 44 patients), but was significantly lower in survivors. Acute peritoneal dialysis is a useful procedure in the management of ARF in the elderly. However, we suggest that elderly patients in whom sepsis is a contributory factor to the development of ARF do not benefit from peritoneal dialysis therapy.\r"

Decline in cognitive functioning at follow-up was greater in hearing impaired subjects and this difference persisted after adjustment for the greater age of hearing impaired subjects (P less than .009). Further division of subject by diagnosis showed that only in the Alzheimer's group did hearing impairment predict more rapid cognitive decline at follow-up.\r"

Common and characteristic features of fibromyalgia among the elderly included diffuse musculoskeletal aching and stiffness at multiple sites; modulation of aches and pains by physical fatigue, poor sleep and weather factors; associated symptoms of general fatigue, poor sleep, anxiety/tension and subjective soft tissue swelling; and multiple tender points on physical examination. These features were similar to those among the younger patients, with the exception of chronic functional headaches, self-assessed anxiety/tension, and symptom aggravation by weather factors, mental stress, and by poor sleep, all of which were significantly less common among the elderly (P less than .05). Importantly, fibromyalgia was recognized by referring physicians in only 17% of the elderly patients with this condition. Misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatment were common among these patients, with corticosteroid therapy in 40% before their rheumatology consultation.\r"

A history of falling in the previous year was associated with increased areas of sway. Increased body mass was associated with decreased velocity of sway. Poor near, but not far, visual acuity was associated with increased areas of sway. A postural drop of 10 mmHg or more in diastolic pressure was associated with increased velocity of sway. The associations between these variables and the balance measures persisted after adjustment for age and each other to adjust for potential confounding. Slower hand reaction times and poor hearing were associated with increased areas of sway, but these associations were removed after adjustment for age and near visual acuity. There were no associations between any of the balance measures and postural changes in systolic pressure and heart rate. There were no associations between balance measures and base of support. The observed associations, if causal, can aid in development and testing of effective interventions to improve balance and prevent falls in the elderly.\r"

Subsequent review by a radiologist raised the question of a second cervical vertebra (C-2) abnormality, and the patient was recalled. Cervical computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an unstable oblique fracture of C-2 and a congenital nonfusion of the arch of C-1. The patient was placed in halo traction, and subsequent radiographs revealed a fracture of the transverse process of C-7. The patient made an uneventful recovery. The limitations of routine cervical radiographs are well-documented, but no feasible alternative exists as a screening procedure. Thus, a certain level of uncertainty must be accepted. Both physician and patient must recognize the limitations inherent in all medical practice and that follow-up examination and treatment are essential.\r"

However, verapamil has not generally been considered helpful in the treatment of ventricular dysrhythmias. Five cases are reported in which verapamil was used to terminate a cycle of supraventricular tachycardia-mediated recurrent ventricular fibrillation that could not be suppressed by conventional antidysrhythmics such as lidocaine, procainamide, and bretylium, Proposed mechanisms of verapamil's beneficial effect in this usually fatal situation include (1) a reduction in oxygen consumption related to the reduction in heart rate, thereby raising the ventricular fibrillation threshold; (2) direct anti-ischemic effect; and (3) a direct antidysrhythmic effect. These proposed mechanisms are substantiated by clinical studies. On the basis of this observation, it is recommended that in a situation of supraventricular tachycardia-mediated recurrent ventricular fibrillation that cannot be terminated by conventional antidysrhythmics, the administration of verapamil should be considered.\r"

This atmosphere can lead to patient dissatisfaction and may contribute to the high rate of noncompliance with discharge instructions and medications. To cope with this problem, a prospective study was designed to evaluate a telephone follow-up system and its effect on patient care and satisfaction. During a 1-month period, all emergency department charts were reviewed daily, and approximately 15% were selected for recontact. These charts were selected using a detailed list of 20 criteria developed by staff emergency physicians. Calls were made by an emergency department physician, nurse, or social worker on the day following the patient's visit. Calls were assigned to staff members (physician, nurse, social worker) on the basis of preestablished criteria within the spectrum of their expertise and training. We were able to reach 81% (229/281) of the patients selected for recontact. The purpose of these calls was to question patients about changes in clinical status, reinforce discharge instructions, and identify any patient complaints about treatment. An average of 1.6 calls were made to successfully contact each patient. The calls lasted an average of 70 seconds. Of the patients contacted 42% (97/229) required further clarification of their discharge instructions. The calls resulted in direct medical intervention in the majority of patients (6/7) who stated their clinical condition had worsened. Ninety-five percent of the patients questioned (112/118) felt that the call was useful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The molecular basis and genetic restrictions of collaboration between Th cells and macrophages (Mo) and the numbers of types of collaboration in the Ag-specific cellular immune response were analyzed. Using the response of cloned Ag-specific T cells we examined the mechanisms of induction of the macrophage procoagulant response. Two generic types of collaboration were identified. One was mediated by the lymphokine monocyte procoagulant inducing factor (MPIF) and the second mechanism was by apparent contact collaboration. The lymphokine MPIF was produced by T cells and cloned CD4+ T cells after specific Ag stimulation. Cloned CD8+ cells, most of which also exhibited cytolytic activity, produced little MPIF. There was no evident restriction of the response of Mo of different MHC or background genes. In the second collaborative pathway a subset of CD4+ cloned Th cells were able to directly collaborate by an apparent contact mechanism with Mo for the procoagulant response. There was no correlation of this latter capacity with MPIF production. In addition abrogation of protein synthesis and lymphokine production by Ag-driven clones did not abrogate the direct cell association type of collaboration. Both forms of collaboration were equally efficient across MHC incompatibility barriers and different genetic background. We conclude that there are two independent and parallel Th:Mo collaborative pathways for Ag-driven responses in this limb of the cellular immune response, i.e., a MPIF lymphokine pathway and a contact pathway, and that there are quantitative and qualitative clonal differences in the use of these two pathways. We suggest that the existence of multiple parallel pathways for cellular collaboration may occur more widely in the Th:Mo limb of the immune response in respect to other Mo effector molecules and should be explored to understand the orchestration of this limb of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The eighth component of human C is essential for the formation of the membranolytic C attack complex. C8 has a unique structure in that two covalently linked chains, C8 alpha and C8 gamma, are associated non-covalently with the third chain, C8 beta. In order to study the structure and assembly of the C8 molecule, a panel of mAb has been produced against the C component C8. Eight of these mAb had reactivity to the C8 alpha-gamma subunit, whereas four reacted with C8 beta. One of the C8 alpha-gamma mAb, C8A2, had specificity for an epitope on the C8 alpha-chain and exhibited no cross-reactivity to any of the other terminal C components, including C8 beta. C8A2 inhibited the hemolytic activity of the C8 alpha-gamma subunit but had no effect on the activity of fluid phase whole C8 or C8 within membrane-bound C5b-8. Functional experiments suggest that C8A2 inhibits C8 alpha-gamma activity by interfering with its interaction with the C8 beta-chain. In an enzyme immunoassay using the C8A2 mAb, free C8 alpha-gamma subunit could be detected in both homozygous and heterozygous C8 beta-deficient serum. However, only low level binding was observed when homozygous C5- and C7-deficient sera were tested. Thus the mAb, C8A2, recognizes an epitope expressed on the C8 alpha-gamma subunit but not on intact C8 and can detect free C8 alpha-gamma in the presence of native C8.\r"

These analogs contained ribo- and phosphorothioate substitutions, namely, poly(r(GC], poly(rGdC), poly(d(sGC], poly(d(GsC], and poly(d(sGsC]. The nucleic acids were complexed to methylated BSA and injected into C57BL/6 mice. Poly(d(GC] was not immunogenic, whereas the analogs gave a strong response. Analysis of the sera revealed that antibody populations were present, which recognized A, B, and Z form nucleic acids. In particular, immunization with poly(d(sGC] and poly(d(GsC] produced antibodies that bound poly(d(GC] and poly(d(IC]. The nuclease sensitivity of these polymers also was investigated. Poly(d(GC] was rapidly degraded by pancreatic DNase I, whereas the phosphorothioate derivatives were resistant, and the ribo-substituted polymers were resistant to both RNases and DNase I. Similarly, the nucleases present in mouse serum digested calf thymus DNA and ribosomal rRNA while both types of analog persisted indefinitely. These results suggest the hypothesis that duplex DNAs are generally not immunogenic because they are rapidly degraded by serum nucleases. Therefore, they escape immune detection.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of mast cells in the initiation of inflammation was studied in genetically mast cell-deficient mice, WBB6F1-W/Wv. Inflammation was induced by i.p. injection of thioglycollate. The influx of neutrophils was markedly delayed in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice as compared to the WBB6F1-+/+, mice (congeneic controls). At the time (14 h) of maximum influx of neutrophils in WBB6F1-+/+ mice, thioglycollate caused a 3-fold increase in the total cell number in the peritoneal lavage fluid, and the neutrophil count was elevated 14-fold. At the same time point in W/Wv mice, the total cell number in the peritoneal lavage fluid was not increased significantly and the neutrophils were increased only three- to four-fold. Not only was the neutrophil influx in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice delayed, but the length of time during which the neutrophil count was elevated in the peritoneal fluid was significantly shortened. Transfer (i.p.) of mast cells cultured from the bone marrow of congeneic controls corrected the delay in the neutrophil influx. The magnitude of the neutrophil influx in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice was equivalent to that of congeneic controls 9 days after mast cell repletion. Histologic studies were performed to follow the migration and differentiation of mast cells after adoptive transfer into WBB6F1-W/Wv mice. No connective tissue mast cells could be identified on day 9 when the inflammatory reaction was restored. Migration of mast cells into the tissue, as studied in the cecum, progressed steadily. On day 9 after adoptive transfer, the mast cell number was 38% of congeneic controls. Therefore, the increase in thioglycollate-induced neutrophil influx in WBB6F1W/Wv mice after mast cell repletion seemed to be correlated, at least to some extent, with the migration of mast cells into tissues and not with differentiation into connective tissue mast cells. However, a certain maturation and differentiation may have occurred. These results suggest that mast cells play an important role, although they do not seem to be the only cell type responsible for the initiation of inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "89009701\r", 
  ".W": "Most previous studies of IgG FcR on neutrophils (PMN) have focused on a single FcR of Mr = 50 to 70 kDa, which is recognized by mAb 3G8 and anti-Leu-11a. In the course of studying the effects of extracellular proteases on PMN receptor expression and function, we found that treatment with human leukocyte elastase reduced the expression of this FcR on the PMN surface by as much as 85% in flow cytometric studies, but did not inhibit ingestion of IgG-coated particles or O2- production induced by multivalent IgG complexes, and caused only a 35% decrease in IC binding to PMN. Since a second FcR with Mr = 40 kDa recognized by mAb IV-3, recently has been identified on PMN, we sought to determine if this FcR was resistant to elastase and thus accounted for the elastase stability of IgG-mediated PMN functions. Elastase treatment that reduced 3G8 binding by 85% caused no decrease in binding of mAb IV-3. For non-elastase-treated PMN, mAb IV-3 against the 40 kDa FcR caused as much as 79 +/- 7% inhibition of IgG-induced O2- production, whereas mAb 3G8 against the 50 to 70 kDa FcR caused only 32 +/- 5% inhibition. In contrast, for IC-binding, mAb IV-3 caused only 15 +/- 6% inhibition, whereas mAb 3G8 caused as much as 80 +/- 9% inhibition, a reversal of their relative effects on O2- production. In parallel studies with elastase-treated PMN, mAb IV-3 actually blocked more IC binding than did mAb 3G8, 55 +/- 4% vs 40 +/- 6%, respectively, presumably because most of the 50 to 70 kDa FcR molecules had been cleaved. The effect of the two mAb together in blocking IC binding was additive, whereas for blocking of O2- production, mAb 3G8 added little or nothing to the effect of mAb IV-3 alone. Direct 125I-labeled Ab binding studies with intact PMN revealed seven times as many 50 to 70 kDa as 40kDa FcR, 110,200 +/- 9600 and 15,100 +/- 700 sites/cell, respectively. Our findings suggest that the elastase-resistant 40 kDa FcR is primarily responsible for IgG-mediated activation of human PMN, whereas the elastase-sensitive 50 to 70 kDa FcR predominates in IC binding, by virtue of its numerical superiority, but does not directly activate the cell. The latter may serve to hold IgG-coated microorganisms or other multivalent IC in place at the PMN surface, enhancing contact with the 40 kDa FcR and thus facilitating cell activation in a cooperative manner.\r"

MPIF induces procoagulant activity on the surface of macrophages and thus may play a central role in the expression of cell-mediated immunity. Highly enriched MPIF-alpha and -beta, separated by virtue of their basic isoelectric point and affinity for heparin, induced local induration and fibrin deposition and cellular infiltration similar to that observed in delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, when injected intradermally. Margination with of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) along the endothelium as well as increased PMN infiltration was evident after 4 h. In contrast to other inflammatory mediators (e.g., C5a, IL-1) reactivity was sustained, with greater numbers of mononuclear cells apparent 24 h after skin testing. Changes in the dermis were evident 4 h after MPIF injection with increased numbers of cells near areas where spaces in the collagen bundles had formed. Dermal thickening was evident after 24 h and collagen fiber structure was disrupted. Extravascular fibrinogen/fibrin was most prominent 24 h after testing. LPS, which induces macrophage procoagulant activity in vitro, did not induce the histopathologic changes evident with MPIF. MPIF was chemotactic for PMN and macrophages in vitro. Chemotactic activity was heat-labile and not due to C5a. Migration was dependent on a concentration gradient, as determined by checkerboard analysis, indicating that MPIF promoted chemotaxis rather than chemokinesis. Experiments reported here suggest that MPIF is an important mediator of fibrin deposition and cellular infiltration characteristic of cell-mediated immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The neuropeptide substance P (SP), which has been suggested to mediate neurogenic inflammation, induces in human neutrophils the activation of the respiratory burst measured as O2 consumption and H2O2 production, and a cytochalasin B-dependent secretion of specific and azurophilic granules. The SP(4-11) fragment is much more stimulant than the entire molecule, whereas the SP(1-4) fragment is inactive. The respiratory and secretory response to SP are associated with an activation of phosphoinositide turnover, of Ca2+ influx and release from intracellular stores. Pertussis toxin inhibits 70% of the respiratory response and the residual 30% activity remains, even increasing 10-fold the concentration of the toxin. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, a putative inhibitor of protein kinase C, does not modify the respiratory response to SP. Cytochalasin B significantly depresses the activation of the respiration by SP, whereas it moderately enhances the activation of phosphoinositide turnover and potentiates the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The results are discussed in relation to the receptor apparatus involved in SP activity, the signal transduction sequence activated by SP for the stimulation of NADPH oxidase, and the role of cell response to SP in the inflammatory process.\r"

  ".W": "Potential mechanisms of TNF-alpha action on tumor cells have been investigated in a model of mouse fibroblasts transformed by distinct retroviral vectors carrying the v-mos, c-myc, and v-Ha-ras oncogene, respectively. Treatment of v-mos and c-myc transformed cells with murine rTNF-alpha in non-cytotoxic concentrations caused a strong inhibition of both proliferative capacity in monolayer culture and colony formation in soft agar. In contrast, v-Ha-ras transformed cells showed little sensitivity to TNF-alpha treatment. These changes in cell growth characteristics of v-mos and c-myc transformants was preceded by a selective reduction of oncogene-specific steady RNA levels, whereas no RNA down-regulation was observed for v-Ha-ras transformants. An unchanged transcriptional activity of the LTR-controlled v-mos and c-myc genes, but a decreased half-life of oncogene-specific mRNA suggests that TNF-alpha primarily affects stability of v-mos and c-myc RNA without influencing the activity of retroviral promoters. This is confirmed by an unchanged chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in TNF-treated LTR-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase transformants. Removal of TNF-alpha from cultures of reverted cells provoked a rapid retransformation, with full recovery of neoplastic growth characteristics 10 days after abrogation of TNF-alpha treatment. These data suggest that in cases of non-cytocidal action of TNF-alpha persistent suppression of tumor cell growth requires continuous TNF-alpha treatment.\r"

These class II-expressing transfectants were used to analyze by flow cytometry the molecular specificities of 20 anti-class II mAb. These analyes indicate that some mAb are more broadly reactive than was previously thought based on immunochemical studies. In contrast, the narrow molecular specificities of other anti-class II mAb were confirmed by this approach. Transfectants expressing human class II molecules should be valuable reagents for studies of B cell and T cell defined epitopes on these molecules.\r"

A detailed examination of TNF-membrane interactions revealed that although TNF bound avidly to model membrane targets, no damage was generated under any condition tested. Binding of TNF, monitored with 125I-labeled as well as unlabeled protein, was enhanced at low pH. In the pH range tested (i.e., 4 to 8), target membrane permeability actually decreased in the presence of TNF. This membrane stabilization may be a consequence of TNF insertion into the target bilayer, a process we detected through use of an intramembranous photolabeling assay; interestingly, the efficiency of TNF insertion into membranes increased dramatically with decreasing pH. We conclude that native TNF does not cause pore formation directly and that its ability to induce cell lysis, as monitored by 51Cr release, is a consequence of some as yet obscure signaling event or intracellular activity. Parallel studies were carried out with diphtheria toxin, a protein with a more thoroughly characterized pH-dependent intoxification pathway. This toxin displayed acid-enhanced activities with both biologic and artificial targets.\r"

Treatment of the Hy-1.2 hybridoma-producing IgG2a-anti-TNP antibodies with ethylmethanesulfonate provided us with a mutant clone, producing antibodies with reduced capacity for C activation. The antibodies retained normal Ag-binding capacity, staphylococcal protein A reactivity, and association to FcR for IgG on murine macrophages. No significant polypeptide deletion or class-switch was observed, but a significant change in clonotype was revealed by IEF. Intravenous injection of the mutant antibodies in immune complex form induced different tissue distributions of Ag in mice; i.e., more in kidneys and less in spleen, and developed more mesangial deposits in renal glomeruli compared with those of the wild type. Moreover, the production of granulomatous lesions in vivo caused by immune complexes of TNP-Sepharose was augmented by using mutant antibodies. These lesions demonstrated an enhanced accumulation of macrophages with multinucleated giant cells. Availability of this kind of mutant mAb is thus helpful in the elucidation of the biologic functions and consequences of immune complexes.\r"

It was subsequently shown to be an allotype of component C4 of the C system, with the antigenic determinant carried on the C4d proteolytic fragment of the alpha-chain, thus the designation C4d.1. Alloantisera defining an antithetical Ag, C4d.2, were also prepared. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the structural difference between the two specificities resides in a single tryptic peptide of C4d. As an efficient approach to definition of the amino acid difference(s) involved, genomic clones covering the C4d regions from two H-2 haplotypes of the C4d.1 type have been prepared and sequenced, and compared with two sequences already available for C4d.2-type molecules. The results indicate that the rather striking serologic difference between C4d.1 and C4d.2 is attributable to the single amino acid substitution of arginine in C4d.2 for glutamine in C4d.1. The substituted residue is in a highly hydrophilic region of the C4 molecule, at a position homologous to one that contributes to the Chido/Rodgers serologic difference of human C4 molecules. This substitution also determines a new Pst I site in C4d.1 strains. A HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism between C4d.1 and C4d.2 has also been observed.\r"

LT extracted from the lung effluent were separated by different reverse phase and straight phase HPLC procedures as methylated and nonmethylated compounds. Identity of eluting LT was confirmed by UV spectrum analysis and immunoreactivity. Pulmonary artery injection of 75 to 300 nmol of LTA4 resulted in the rapid appearance of cysteinyl-LT as well as LTB4 in the recirculating perfusate. The yield of these enzymatically generated LTA4 metabolites vs non-enzymatic hydrolysis products (6-trans-LTB4, 5-trans-epi-LTB4, 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) ranged above 90%. Experiments with application of tritiated LTA4 showed exclusive origin of the detected LT from the exogenously applied precursor. The time course of cysteinyl-LT appearance in the perfusate suggested metabolism of LTC4 via LTD4 to LTE4, whereas there was no evidence for LTB4 omega-oxidation. In the dose range of LTA4 used, the enzymatic conversion of this LT precursor did not approach saturation. Collectively, these data indicate that the intact pulmonary vasculature contains a hitherto not described capacity for enzymatic conversion of intravascularly offered LTA4 to both cysteinyl-LT and LTB4. This may be of biological significance for a putative transcellular biosynthesis of LT in the pulmonary microcirculation upon contact with LTA4 feeder cells, such as activated granulocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Data are presented to suggest that differential Ag expression by parasites derived from diffuse (DCL) vs local (LCL) cutaneous leishmaniasis patients may be responsible for the Ag-specific anergy seen in DCL patients. The evidence suggests that promastigotes derived from DCL patients express epitopes which preferentially stimulate suppressor activities in DCL patients. These determinants appear to be expressed less, if at all by promastigotes derived from LCL patients. The Ag-specific suppression or nonresponsiveness which dominates the immune response in DCL patients during an active infection can be abrogated by drug treatment or removal of live DCL parasites, which suggests that Ag-induced regulatory cells, probably of T cell lineage, are most likely responsible for the nonresponsiveness seen in untreated DCL patients. Thus the mechanisms of immune regulation operating in this disease differ from that of lepromatous leprosy where the specific unresponsiveness (anergy) is irreversible even after successful treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphokine suppressor cell-inducing factor (SIF), obtained from 15 liters of serum-free culture supernatants of the natural suppressor cell line, M1-A5, has been purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase-HPLC. Purity of SIF was assessed by the migration of the factor as a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the elution from reverse-phase-HPLC column as a single and sharp peak. SIF activity was retained after both procedures. Two protein factors with SIF activity were isolated from M1-A5 culture supernatants. The first protein factor (SIF alpha) had a Mr of 43 kDa, and the second protein factor (SIF beta) had a Mr of 6 kDa. Final purification of SIF alpha yielded 5 micrograms protein with specific activity of 4 x 10(6) U/mg protein. Final purification of SIF beta yielded 40 micrograms protein with specific activity of 7.5 x 10(7) U/mg protein. The relationship between SIF alpha and SIF beta, as well as the relationship with other suppressor factors, will be addressed.\r"

By contrast, lymphokine-activated bone marrow cells have potent natural suppressor as well as veto activity, and also have cytolytic activity characteristic of lymphokine-activated killer cells. Veto activity of fresh bone marrow cells is eliminated by 9 Gy irradiation and by depletion of cells expressing Qa-2, but is unaffected by removal of cells expressing Thy-1, Qa-5, Ly-5, or asialo GM1. By contrast, the veto and NS activities of lymphokine-activated bone marrow cells are both abrogated by C lysis depletion of cells expressing Qa-2, Qa-5, Thy-1, asialo GM1, NK1, and Ly-11, but are unaffected by depletion of cells expressing Ly-2. Bone marrow cells depleted of Qa2+ cells fail to generate veto or natural suppressor activity when cultured in Con A-conditioned medium, unlike bone marrow cells depleted of mature NK1.1+ NK cells. Cloned NK cell line F8 is able to mediate both natural suppression and veto. These findings indicate that bone marrow veto and natural suppression are not mediated by T or NK cells present de novo in the bone marrow, but are dependent on proliferating cells that phenotypically resemble pre-NK cells. The progeny of these cells have the phenotype and functional activity of lymphokine-activated killer cells, and are capable of directly mediating both veto and natural suppression.\r"

Although the cytotoxic activity of TNF has been well documented, the mechanism of TNF-induced lysis is not well understood. The goal of this investigation was to determine whether TNF caused one of the classic forms of cell death, i.e., apoptosis, which is characterized by nuclear disintegration and cytoplasmic \"boiling,\" or necrosis, which is characterized by the formation of a \"balloon-like\" plasma membrane and a lack of nuclear disintegration. Therefore, to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis, we have used time-lapse video microscopy to observe the death of several TNF-sensitive target cell lines while measuring the release of Na2(51)CrO4 and [3H]TdR from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. As targets we selected two spontaneously sensitive cell lines, F17 and L-M, and one resistant cell line, C3HA, which was sensitized by treatment with cycloheximide or by infection with the adeno-SV40 hybrid virus Ad2+ND2. We find that the type of cell death observed depends on the cell being tested. For example, in F17 cells we found that TNF treatment induced a classical form of apoptosis. In contrast, TNF induced a necrotic form of cell death in L-M cells, similar to the lysis induced by antibody and C. Finally, we found that sensitized C3HA cells displayed a novel cytolytic phenotype which resembled apoptosis but did not include DNA fragmentation. These results emphasize the complex nature of the TNF-induced cytotoxic response.\r"

Although the majority of mAb examined did not discriminate between the two sources of Fc gamma, several mAb exhibited remarkable specificity for autologous HI Fc gamma. We did not detect any mAb which exhibited the converse specificity. Of the mAb chosen for study, all except one appeared specific for determinants located in C gamma 2; the exception specifically reacted with pFc', and did not discriminate between the two Fc preparations. Importantly, partial deglycosylation of autologous PI Fc gamma led to equivalent reactivity with previously HI-specific mAb. The results of this study provide immunologic evidence that abnormal C gamma 2 structures exist prior to and reach serologically detectable levels during the hyperimmune response in these animals, apparently as a result of glycosylation pattern alterations within the Fc region. Such autoantigenic differences could account for the induction of RF under these conditions, and perhaps in certain human arthritic diseases as well.\r"

  ".U": "89009795\r", 
  ".W": "The eighth component of C (C8) is composed of two subunits C8 beta and C8 alpha-gamma, which are non-covalently bound in a 1/1 ratio in the intact molecule. The genes encoding the polypeptide chains composing the subunits demonstrate close genetic linkage. To assess the functional expression of these genes at the protein level, normal human serum and C8-deficient sera were electrophoresed in native polyacrylamide gels following which C8, C8 beta, and C8 alpha-gamma were detected using hemolytic overlays. These experiments demonstrated that normal sera contained free C8 alpha-gamma in addition to intact C8. Free C8 alpha-gamma was not observed when C8 was reconstituted by mixing C8 beta-deficient serum with C8 alpha-gamma-deficient serum in a ratio optimized for C8 activity, suggesting that the free C8 alpha-gamma observed in normal serum was not due to dissociation of intact C8. Inasmuch as this technique did not adequately separate C8 and C8 beta, sera were also examined by anion exchange chromatography. C8 alpha-gamma-deficient serum contained C8 beta in a single peak in the 1.4 ms/cm fall through. C8 beta-deficient serum contained a major peak of C8 alpha-gamma at 7.1 ms/cm and a lesser peak coeluting with C9 at 9.5 ms/cm. Normal serum contained both intact C8 eluting between 2.4 to 5.5 ms/cm and C8 alpha-gamma eluting at 7.1 ms/cm. Free C8 beta was not detectable in normal serum indicating that free C8 alpha-gamma was not due to C8 dissociation. Mixing aliquots from the chromatographic peak of C8 beta activity with the peaks of C8 alpha-gamma activity in C8 beta-deficient serum or in normal serum generated intact C8 hemolytic activity. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-C8 confirmed the presence of antigenic material of appropriate m.w. in each peak. These findings demonstrate that serum contains excess C8 alpha-gamma relative to C8 beta, despite the equimolar presence of the subunits in intact C8. Thus the availability of C8 beta determines the quantity of C8 produced. Further, these data suggest the possibility that the C8 structural genes may be differentially expressed despite their close genetic linkage.\r"

  ".W": "A variable T lymphocyte proliferative response to murine IgG1 anti-T3 monoclonal antibodies, in which most North American Caucasians respond whereas a minority do not, is well established. This is most likely the result of a genetic polymorphism manifested by 1) the inability of the monocyte 40-kDa IgG FcR of some individuals to bind murine IgG1, and 2) a distinctive trimorphic pattern on IEF of the monocyte 40-kDa FcR, one form being seen in all individuals who do not respond and another form (or a combination of both forms) being seen in those who do respond. We have evaluated the IEF patterns of the platelet 40-kDa FcR and find that in every individual tested the pattern for platelet FcR correlates with that seen for the monocyte 40-kDa FcR pattern. Furthermore, the platelets of those individuals whose \"nonresponder\" monocyte 40-kDa FcR did not mediate a murine IgG1 anti-T3 response did not respond with an aggregation reaction to murine IgG1 immune complexes (opsonized E). In contrast, platelets from donors possessing \"responder\" monocytes displayed positive \"aggregation\" responses to E coated with murine IgG1 antibody. However, the platelet FcR structural polymorphism described earlier did not correlate with the donor-specific variability in capacity of platelets to respond functionally to aggregated human IgG described in an earlier paper. Rather, the variation in capacity of platelets from individual donors to respond functionally to aggregated human IgG was related to the quantitative expression of platelet FcR. These data indicate that the molecular mechanisms responsible for the platelet 40-kDa FcR structural polymorphism are quite different from the mechanisms governing the variation in quantitative expression of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Human mononuclear cell-derived histamine-releasing factor (MNC-HRF) has m.w. of 29,000 and 23,000 and two charge species isoelectric at pH 6.9 and 7.3. Minor forms of HRF are also seen at m.w. of 12,000 to 15,000 and 60,000 to 80,000. In this manuscript we have further defined the response of human basophils to MNC-HRF in terms of atopic status of cell donors and the role of IgE antibody. We found that basophils of allergic persons, nonallergic controls, or donors who have positive skin tests but no symptoms, cannot be distinguished based upon responsiveness to HRF. Further, the response of basophils that have been desensitized to anti-IgE is retained when they are subsequently stimulated with HRF derived from human MNC. Thus an interaction with cell-surface IgE to cause histamine release is not evident. Nevertheless, one of two IgE myeloma proteins tested were capable of binding HRF and such binding could be utilized as a purification step. We conclude that MNC-HRF is heterogeneous in terms of size, charge, and affinity for a subpopulation of IgE. Histamine release is more prominent in atopic individuals but does not appear to require an interaction with IgE.\r"

  ".U": "89009801\r", 
  ".W": "Picryl chloride factor (PC1-F) is an antigen (TNP hapten)-binding T cell factor that initiates PC1 contact sensitivity (CS). PC1-F initiates PC1 CS by mediating an early 2-h skin swelling reaction that is due to local release of the vasoactive amine serotonin (5-HT) by mast cells, and perhaps other 5-HT-containing cells. Experiments were conducted to determine if PC1-F could sensitize normal mast cells in vitro for subsequent release of 3H-5-HT that had been taken up previously. It was found that PC1-F could sensitize mast cells, inasmuch as incubation with PC1-F, followed by washing, resulted in the ability to release 5-HT by challenge with Ag (TNP-bovine serum albumin), or by an anti-factor mAb called 14-30. As with release induced by anti-TNP IgE mAb PC1-F-induced release required phosphatidyl serine. Mast cell sensitization and activation for 5-HT release by PC1-F was not due to contamination of PC1-F with IgE antibody, because IgE (and not PC1-F) was sensitive to reduction and alkylation. Also, affinity columns linked with 14-30 or anti-IgE showed that the mast cell sensitizing and activating property of PC1-F was clearly separate from that of IgE. PC1-F-induced release was not IgE dependent, because mast cells that were acid-stripped and largely depleted of surface IgE, could then be sensitized by PC1-F. In vivo experiments demonstrated that local challenge with 14-30 antibody induced a 2-h ear swelling reaction in actively contact sensitized mice, or adoptive recipients of sensitized cells, and in normal mice that received PC1-F i.v. These findings suggest that in vitro sensitization of mast cells with PC1-F, and subsequent in vitro release of 5-HT induced by challenge with 14-30 antibodies, correlates with the initiation of PC1 CS in vivo. Therefore, in the initiation of CS by PC1-F, mast cells can be one source of 5-HT, to cause the early, vasoactive phase of CS.\r"

This activity was found in medium conditioned for 24 to 48 h, but was not present in medium conditioned for longer time intervals. BM cells from PGE2-treated mice incubated over a concentration range of 0.1 to 1.0 x 10(6) cells/ml and SPL cells over a range of 1.0 to 10 x 10(6) cells/ml produced CM with equivalent degrees of inhibition for CFU-GM proliferation. Titration of this activity revealed a significant inhibitory effect still present at a 1/256 dilution. Inhibitory activity was similar whether or not CM was prepared in the presence or absence of FCS. Inhibition of CFU-GM development was approximately equal in the presence of either PWM SPL CM or L cell CM as sources of CSF activity. Morphologic analysis of CFU-GM revealed an equivalent inhibition of monocyte, monocyte-neutrophil, and neutrophil CFU-GM by the PGE2-stimulated inhibitory activity. Equivalent picogram amounts of PGE were measured in CM derived from BM or SPL cells from either control or PGE2-treated mice, indicating a low probability that injected PGE2 was carried over in the CM and contributed to CFU-GM inhibition. Protease digestion of BM or SPL cell CM from PGE2-treated mice revealed a loss of inhibitory activity after trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase, and neuraminidase treatment. Inhibitory activity was also ablated by heat treatment at 56 degrees C for 30 min and 100 degrees C for 5 min. Acrylamide-agarose gel filtration of BM CM revealed an active inhibitory fraction in the Mr range of 5.5 to 8.0 kDa. The results of the present study suggest that one of the mechanisms by which PGE2 exerts its in vivo myelopoietic inhibitory action may be by stimulating the production of an inhibitory factor or factors from BM and SPL cells.\r"

One genomic DNA clone contains the promoter region and the first two exons, as determined by primer extension analyses and S1 nuclease protection studies as well as nucleotide sequence determination. The first exon does not encode a peptide, while the second exon contains the initiation ATG codon and encodes the signal peptide. The other nine genomic DNA clones, which are separated from the first genomic clone by an unknown distance, are connected and span a total of 73 kb. The nine connected genomic clones encode a total of 31 exons. The 33 exons encoded by these 10 genomic clones account for the entire cDNA sequences including the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences. Exon 3 and exons 7 through 15 encode the extracellular domain sequences that are common to all LCA isoforms. Differential usage of exons 4, 5, and 6, generates at least five distinct LCA isoforms. Exon 16 encodes the transmembrane peptide. The cytoplasmic region of the leukocyte common antigens is composed of two homologous domains. Exons 17 through 24 encode the first domain, and exons 25 through 32 encode the second domain. The comparison of these exons indicated that the homologous domains were generated by duplication of several exons. The most 3' exon (exon 33) encodes the carboxy terminus of the LCA molecules and includes the entire 3' untranslated sequence.\r"

In an effort to determine the Ag recognized by NCC on these targets, mAb were raised against NC-37 target cells. Four anti-NC-37 mAb were chosen for further characterization based on their effects on NCC lysis of target cells. Purified mAb 18C2 and 1E7 (IgM isotype) inhibited NCC killing of the following targets: U937, MOLT-4, K562, HL-60, DAUDI, NC-37, P815, and YAC-1. The dose-dependent inhibitory activity occurred at the target cell level and ranged from 50 to 70% at a concentration of 50 micrograms/well when compared to noninhibitory mAb 7C6 and 1D4 (IgG isotype). Similarly, mAb 18C2 protected the fish parasite Tetrahymena pyriformis from lysis by NCC when compared to mAb 7C6. Adsorption experiments demonstrated that the inhibitory effect on NC-37 lysis by NCC could be removed in a titratable fashion by incubation of mAb 1E7 with any one of the other target cell lines, but it could not be removed by incubation with effector cells. The inhibitory activity of mAb 1E7 and 18C2 was shown to be caused by the inhibition of conjugate formation between effector and NC-37 target cells. The relative membrane concentration of the antigenic determinants recognized by these mAb on the target cells was studied by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled mAb. These experiments showed that all four mAb bound to the surface of the cells tested. Biochemical analysis with Western blots and immunoprecipitation showed that mAb 18C2 and 1E7 recognize two Ag in NC-37 lysates: a larger protein of around 80 kDa and a smaller one of 42 kDa.\r"

  ".W": "This study characterized totally the effects of early Ag exposure by the suckling route on later specific antibody responses. When mother mice of BALB/c or C57BL/6 strains were injected with deaggregated human gamma-globulin (HGG) immediately after delivery, total amounts of HGG in sera of offspring increased until 2 wk of age. The catabolism of transferred HGG was extremely slow and the half-life was about 3 wk in both strains. Hence, small amounts of Ag in mothers, 0.5 micrograms in C57BL/6 and 50 micrograms in BALB/c, could tolerize their offspring effectively. As these were minimum tolerogenic doses, the strain difference in ease of tolerance induction is apparent already during suckling. The study on timing dependent effects of HGG-specific antiserum on tolerance induction by mothers given 50 micrograms HGG demonstrated that the tolerance is achieved within the 1st wk of lactation in C57BL/6 offspring, but not in BALB/c offspring, and the restoration from the tolerance needs more than 6 wk under circumstances, supposedly, without free Ag. Whereas the tolerance was induced in a dose-dependent manner in each class of antibody, the dissociation of tolerant states between IgM, IgG, and IgE antibody classes was found in C57BL/6 offspring. It is interesting that C57BL/6 offspring were sensitized weakly, but significantly, by mothers given subtolerogenic doses. However, this was not apparent in BALB/c. Thus, the Ag dose and the animal strain are related closely to the consequences of this Ag exposure. The aging of suckling mice within the first 2 wk of life or immunomodulators administered early in life did not seriously affect the consequences. Studies on a cellular basis showed that the tolerance is caused by the selective defect in helper T cell function and the suppressor cell activity is not associated with the mechanisms. This contrasts with other models of oral tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid hormones may influence the clinical expression of immunologic disease; however, their mechanism of action is uncertain. By using an experimental model, we studied the effect of sex steroids on the clearance of antibody-coated cells by macrophages in the spleen and liver. Progesterone significantly inhibited the clearance of IgG-coated E by splenic macrophages, whereas no effect was observed on the clearance of heat-altered E. This effect of progesterone was observed at serum concentrations which are attained during human pregnancy and the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, when splenic macrophages were isolated from progesterone-treated animals, they expressed decreased Fc gamma R activity. In addition, structural analogs of progesterone which have diminished glucocorticoid and progesterone activity retained this effect on macrophage Fc gamma R. In contrast, the estrogens estradiol and estriol as well as a structural estrogen analog with minimal estrogenic activity, 1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3,16 beta-diol, enhanced splenic macrophage Fc gamma R-dependent clearance. This action of estradiol could be partially inhibited by the antiestrogen tamoxifen. However, estradiol did not affect the C3-dependent clearance of IgM-coated E by hepatic macrophages. Concurrent administration of estradiol and progesterone demonstrated that the action of estradiol was predominant. These studies indicate that sex steroids alter splenic macrophage Fc gamma R function in vivo. This result may explain the alteration of disease activity in some human immunologic disorders during changes in hormonal state. Furthermore, analogs of progesterone and estrogen, as well as antiestrogens, which minimally affect the sex organs, retain the ability to alter splenic macrophage Fc gamma R function.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to examine immunologic means of regulating the clinical course of murine chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE). We asked whether induction of specific immune tolerance to the major CNS myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), could inhibit the development of R-EAE. Neuroantigen-specific tolerance was induced in SJL/J mice in a dose-dependent manner by the i.v. injection of mouse spinal cord homogenate-coupled syngeneic splenocytes (MSCH-SP) on day -7 relative to immunization on days 0 and +7. Sham-tolerized controls developed significant MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses before the onset of clinical R-EAE. In contrast, MSCH-SP tolerized mice exhibited a dramatically reduced incidence of clinical and histologic signs of disease which correlated with the failure to develop MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In 10 separate experiments, 118/149 (79%) of control mice, but only 22/137 (16%) of tolerized mice developed clinical R-EAE. Tolerance took time to develop and lasted at least 4 wk as mice injected with Ag-coupled splenocytes on day -1 relative to immunization remained susceptible to R-EAE, whereas mice injected on days -7, -14, or -28 were resistant. Tolerance induction required neuroantigens as injection of splenocytes coupled with a syngeneic mouse kidney homogenate failed to significantly alter the incidence of R-EAE or the development of neuroantigen-specific DTH responses. Thus, induction of R-EAE can be specifically and significantly regulated after the i.v. injection of splenocytes coupled with a crude, heterogeneous mixture of neuroantigens (i.e. MSCH).\r"

In order to investigate the restriction specificity of the two Th clones, a transfectant expressing the species-mismatched MHC class II dimer DR1:I-E was tested as an APC. Both T cells showed no loss of Ag sensitivity due to substitution of the murine chain. One of the Th clones, TLC 72, showed even greater degeneracy by responding to Ag in the context of I-Ek. Taking into account the lower level of MHC class II expression on the I-Ek transfectant, there is remarkably little loss of efficiency of Ag-induced T cell activation due to the substitution of I-E for DR as restriction element. The Ag-specific responses of both clones were inhibited by anti-CD4 antibody when DR-transfected L cells or human lymphoblastoid cells were used as APC. This inhibition was also seen when Ag was presented to TLC72 by the I-Ek-expressing transfectant. Whether this inhibition is the result of negative signaling or of blocking an interaction between human CD4 and I-Ek is discussed. Similarly the inhibitory effects of mAb against the T cell accessory molecule LFA/1 were the same for both clones when either the transfectants or the lymphoblastoid cell line were used as APC, suggesting that L cells may express a molecule that is capable of acting as a ligand for human LFA/1. The results presented here further illustrate the value of transfectants in analyzing T cell recognition and accessory cell requirements. The patterns of degeneracy of MHC restriction exhibited by these clones provides a platform for a more detailed analysis of key residues involved in MHC class II-restricted T cell Ag recognition.\r"

HLA-DQ2 beta and DQ3.2 beta cDNA were transferred into DQ3.2 and DQ2 homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines, respectively. Serologic analysis of the infected cell lines with allospecific mAb demonstrated surface expression of these exogenous DQ molecules implying that DQ alpha-chains from DR3, DQ2-positive cells can pair with DQ3.2 beta-chains and, similarly, DQ alpha-chains from DR4, DQ3.2-positive cells can pair with DQ2 beta-chains. Immunoprecipitation of the introduced DQ3.2 beta molecule resulted in co-purification of the allotype-mismatched endogenous DQ2 alpha polypeptide. We also show that vectors with a cytomegalovirus major immediate-early gene enhancer/promoter result in higher levels of expression of the transduced gene compared to previously described HLA vectors with either the SV-40 early enhancer/promoter or the lymphotropic papovavirus-enhanced SV-40 promoter. Although deletion of HLA cDNA did sometimes occur in the process of generating virus-producing clones, the HLA cDNA is stably maintained in virus-producing clones, once it is generated. This retroviral expression system is a highly efficient way to study HLA gene function.\r"

  ".W": "We have explored the possibility of using mAb as tools for distinguishing between closely related gene products. We utilized calcitonin (CT) gene products as a model, because this 32-amino-acid-amidated hormone is biosynthesized by post-translational processing of a larger precursor. By using CT as a hapten, we had previously identified a mAb (CT07) with restricted specificity to mature CT, and had shown that another mAb (CT08) directed to a different epitope bound to both CT and the CT precursor. In this study, we used synthetic peptides analogous to various regions of biosynthetic intermediates of CT as haptens, and generated a library of mAb which define distinct epitopes. First, we identified two separate epitopes located in either the 1-11 or the 12-21 region of the C-terminal flanking peptide of CT (katacalcin, KC), and which were recognized by mAb KC01 and KC04, respectively. Second, we identified a conformational epitope in the C-terminal region of the putative glycine-extended form of CT (CT-Gly). This epitope was recognized by mAb CT19 and was shared by mature CT but not by CT precursors. Third, we identified an epitope restricted to CT-Gly and recognized by mAb CT20. For dissecting between related products of the CT gene, we designed different monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (m-IRMA) based on CT08 as the radiolabeled indicator antibody. A first m-IRMA based on CT07 as the capture antibody specifically recognized mature CT and did not cross-react with CT precursors. Conversely, another m-IRMA with KC01 as the capture antibody was specific for CT precursors and did not cross-react with either mature CT or CT-Gly. A third assay based on CT20 as the capture mAb was specific for CT-Gly and was not affected by the presence of either CT precursors or mature CT. We also used these antibodies to demonstrate that neoplastic C cells incompletely released processed CT precursors in serum, in addition to mature CT. This study demonstrates that mAb can be used as tools to selectively recognize closely related gene products. These findings might be applied to the study of other molecules biosynthesized by enzymatic modifications of a larger precursor.\r"

  ".W": "Normal human neutrophils were stimulated with the yeast cell wall product, zymosan, and examined for two biologic responses, ingestion of particles and production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), under conditions that were comparable and optimal for the quantitation of each response. Monolayers of adherent neutrophils ingested unopsonized zymosan particles, at particle-to-cell ratios of 12.5:1 to 125:1, in a dose- and time-related manner. At a ratio of 125:1, the percentages of neutrophils ingesting greater than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 3 zymosan particles reached plateau levels of 55 +/- 6 and 32 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD, n = 8), respectively, within 30 min. At this same ratio, neutrophils during gravity sedimentation with zymosan particles synthesized LTB4 in a time-dependent manner for at least 45 min. The maximum amount of immunoreactive LTB4 released into supernatants was 3.8 +/- 1.2 ng per 10(6) neutrophils (mean +/- SD, n = 5) and the corresponding total immunoreactive LTB4 was 6.2 +/- 1.9 ng per 10(6) neutrophils. Treatment of 2 x 10(7) suspended neutrophils with 250 micrograms of trypsin for 20 min before concurrent assessment of neutrophil phagocytosis and LTB4 production reduced both of these responses by about 50%. Pretreatment of neutrophils with 800 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast beta-glucan inhibited their ingestion of zymosan by 84% (mean +/- SD, n = 3), with 50% inhibition occurring with 100 micrograms/ml of soluble beta-glucan; 800 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast alpha-mannan had no inhibitory effect. Pretreatment of neutrophils with 400 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast beta-glucan inhibited neutrophil synthesis of LTB4 by 90%, with 50% occurring with 200 micrograms/ml; 400 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast alpha-mannan had no inhibitory effect. The presence of 1.25 micrograms/ml of cytochalasin B during incubation with zymosan particles reduced neutrophil phagocytosis from 65 to 6%, and neutrophil synthesis of LTB4 from total levels of 6.0 +/- 0.3 ng/10(6) cells to zero (mean +/- SD, n = 3). Pretreatment with either cytochalasin B or vinblastine did not alter neutrophil generation of LTB4 induced by calcium ionophore. Neutrophils pretreated with vinblastine, at 4 x 10(-6) to 4 x 10(-4) M, and then maintained at one-half these concentrations during incubation with unopsonized zymosan particles exhibited no diminution in particle ingestion, but were markedly reduced in zymosan-induced synthesis of LTB4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This response is associated with the recovery from irradiated skin of inflammatory mediators derived from membrane phospholipids. We have previously reported that UVB stimulates the production of such mediators by human keratinocytes (HK) in culture. In these studies we examined the effect of UVB on the metabolism of choline containing phospholipids in HK prelabeled with [3H] choline. UVB (400-1600J/m2) stimulated a dose dependent release of [3H] choline from HK within minutes of irradiation. Examination of media extracts by paper chromatography revealed that the released [3H] choline was predominately in the form of glycerophosphorylcholine. Examination of label remaining in membranes of cells after irradiation by acid precipitation and HPLC revealed that the origin of the released [3H] choline was the membrane phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine. These data support a concept of UVB stimulation of both a phospholipase A (1 or 2) and a lysophospholipase. These UVB induced alterations of HK membrane phospholipid metabolism likely have profound effects on UVB-induced inflammation and control of cell growth in human skin.\r"

Adenovirus infections of the epidermis are quite rare. We examined the virus-cell interactions of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and cultured human keratinocytes grown from a variety of body sites. Our intent was to explore the nature of the apparent epithelium-specific susceptibility to Ad2. In brief, we found that in vitro viral susceptibility of the keratinocytes could be reliably predicted based on whether the cells originated from an epidermal or oropharyngeal surface. Ad2 proceeded through a complete vegetative cycle when used to infect cultured keratinocytes from oropharyngeal sites (e.g., gingiva and soft palate). In contrast, Ad2 infection was severely restricted in keratinocytes from epidermal sites (e.g., foreskin, abdomen, and buttock). These results demonstrate that the in vitro response to infection with Ad2 reflects in vivo tissue-specific susceptibility. In vivo, cervical epithelium is rarely infected with Ad2 and yet in culture, cervical keratinocytes were fully permissive for Ad2 replication. We propose that the permissive or nonpermissive response to Ad2 may be regulated by a particular aspect of cell phenotype. Because the permissive responses seen in this study were all generated in keratinocytes from mucosal sites, it is possible the in vitro response to Ad2 reflects inherent differences between mucosal and epidermal keratinocytes.\r"

Drug permeation from saturated aqueous solutions was monitored before and after accelerant treatment (applied in aqueous and PG vehicles). With ES, the study was repeated with 50% ethanol/water as donor and receptor phases instead of water. Two percent Azone in PG promoted 5FU absorption by almost 100-fold, but 3% Azone with 0.1% Tween 20 in normal saline demonstrated only an eightfold effect. Five percent OA in PG was moderately successful, but 4% aqueous DCMS enhanced 5FU permeation 35-fold initially, but rapidly fell to fourfold. PG itself was ineffective. The accelerants were much less effective in promoting ES absorption; only 5% OA in PG enhanced steroid permeation by more than tenfold, but this fell with time to threefold due to washout of accelerant (ethanol/water system). The experimental conditions utilized fully hydrated stratum corneum with permeants in saturated solutions; under these already optimized conditions for permeation, accelerants were only marginally effective in enhancing the delivery of the relatively non-polar drug ES. Polar drug delivery, as exemplified by 5FU, could still be increased markedly. Azone was considerably more effective when used in conjunction with PG compared to an aqueous vehicle; thus PG itself may play an accelerating role. The 5FU results indicated that Azone and OA remained in the tissue for a long period, but DCMS was rapidly removed by washout.\r"

The insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) immunoreactivity, normally demonstrable only in scattered basal epidermal cells, rapidly increased in intensity and frequency in the epidermis. After 3 d of UVB irradiation almost all epidermal cells were outlined by IGF-I immunoreactivity in their plasma membrane. The Langerhans cells expressed intense IGF-I immunoreactivity throughout their cytoplasm. The elevated IGF-I immunoreactivity ceased after 5-7 d and was normalized in 3 weeks. The number of Ia positive epithelial Langerhans cells did not seem to be affected by UVB irradiation. It is concluded that the increased IGF-I immunoreactivity is likely to reflect formation of the trophic peptide IGF-I, most evidently by Langerhans cells, in early events of the inflammatory, reactive response of the skin to UVB irradiation.\r"

  ".U": "89009943\r", 
  ".W": "Physiologic concentrations of retinoic acid strongly inhibit the in vitro maturation of human squamous carcinoma cells in serum-free medium. Differentiation, as measured by the capacity to synthesize cornified cell envelopes, could be induced by hydrocortisone in retinoic acid-treated SqCC/Y1 and CE-81T cells. However, two other cell lines (C4-1 and A431) were less competent to spontaneously form cornified cell envelopes and resistant to the induction of envelope competence by hydrocortisone in the presence of retinoic acid. To investigate the mechanism underlying the resistance of these two lines to hydrocortisone, the characteristics of glucocorticoid receptors were analyzed. Whole cell dexamethasone binding sites ranged from 1300 to 9000 sites per cell for the four cell lines. The binding affinity for dexamethasone was similar in all four squamous carcinoma cell lines (1.32 to 4.75 nM). During retinoic acid-treatment, the binding of dexamethasone by intact SqCC/Y1 and CE-81T cells increased 1.5- to 3.0-fold over 48 h. In contrast, the number of dexamethasone binding sites were decreased by 80% in retinoic acid-treated A431 and C4-1 cells. In each case, the regulation of dexamethasone binding was dependent on the concentration of retinoic acid, with maximal effects being observed at 10(-6) M. Thus, the manner in which retinoic acid regulates the availability of dexamethasone binding sites might explain, in part, the effects of glucocorticoids on differentiation of retinoic acid-treated squamous carcinoma cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) to induce acute dermal and subcutaneous inflammation was examined in a murine model. A number of other proteins, and diluent alone were examined as controls. After subcutaneous injection into the mouse footpad, recombinant human TNF alpha (rHuTNF alpha) induced acute inflammation with an initial marked dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 3 h, with a peak between 4 and 24 h and resolution by 79 h. Recombinant interleukin-2, cytochrome c, and heat-inactivated rHuTNF alpha induced negligible inflammation. Recombinant human lymphotoxin (TNF beta), another control protein, also induced acute inflammation in our system. Because TNF alpha and TFN beta are partially homologous, they may be acting through a similar mechanism. This pro-inflammatory effect of TNF alpha may result from chemotactic activity as well as by induction of secondary mediators. Inflammation induced by TNF alpha was partially suppressed by indomethacin treatment, suggesting that products of the cyclo-oxyganase pathway may mediate a portion of the inflammation involved. Five daily injections of rHuTNF alpha into the mouse footpad resulted in a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate and focal fibrosis. These results suggest that TNF alpha may be an important mediator of acute inflammation in vivo and might provide a signal for the production of collagen.\r"

By means of discontinuous Ficoll-Metrizoate density gradient centrifugation, a fraction containing high numbers of viable, more than 80% pure LC was recovered, as judged by CD1a expression. The purity of the LC-enriched fraction appeared to be dependent on the percentage LC in the crude epidermal cell suspension. LC enriched by this method retained their accessory and antigen-presenting capacities, as determined in the Concanavalin-A induced T-cell response, in the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction and in the antigen-specific T-cell proliferation assay in vitro. The great advantage of this method is that it is simple and rapid and that the isolated LC are unlabeled.\r"

The topical synergistic effect of 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha RI) and androgen receptor inhibitors (ARI) was determined by measurement of the sebaceous gland size (SGS) of the ventral ear skin of the intact, sexually mature male Syrian hamsters. Progesterone (P), a 5 alpha RI, and spironolactone (SL), an ARI, produced a dose responsive decrease in SGS at topical concentrations of 0.01% to 5.0%. At concentrations of 1, 3, and 5%, P and SL combinations produced neither an additive nor synergistic inhibition of SGS. At very low concentrations of up to 0.10%, neither P nor SL alone produced any effect on SGS. When combinations of these two steroids were applied at low concentrations, SGS decreased unilaterally to approximately 50%. This synergy occurred best at a P:SL ratio of 1:2. The lower effective concentrations of P may be explained by its greater percutaneous absorption. Synergy was also demonstrated at low concentrations with other antiandrogens: cyproterone acetate, canrenone, hydroxyflutamide, and N-N-diethyl-4-methyl-3-oxo-4-aza-5 alpha-androstane- 17 beta-carboxamide. The use of anti-androgen combinations at low concentrations is of value because of the decreased risk of systemic side effects while maintaining potent topical efficacy.\r"

Quantitative studies were made of changes in the populations of neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The number of inflammatory phase cells (neutrophils and macrophages) decreased more rapidly under moist conditions than under dry conditions. There was also a more rapid increase in the number of proliferative phase cells (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) in the moist wounds; by 5 d after injury 66% of the cells of the granulation tissue of the moist wounds were of this type, compared with only 48% of the cells of equivalent areas of the dry wounds. By 21 d after injury the number of fibroblasts in the granulation tissue of the moist wounds had fallen below that in the dry wounds, suggesting that progress from the proliferative into the remodelling phase of repair was more rapid in the moist wounds. It was concluded that there was an acceleration of the inflammatory and proliferative phases of dermal repair in wounds healing under moist conditions when compared with those healing under dry conditions.\r"

The involved areas from psoriasis patients contained a statistically significant seven- to 11-fold increase in the levels of leukotriene B4, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid-like compound, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid compound and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in comparison to normal samples and a three- to sevenfold increase in comparison to uninvolved tissue. The uninvolved areas contained 40% to 100% increases in the levels of these compounds in comparison to normal tissue; these increases were statistically significant except for 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid-like compound. From a single keratome biopsy, multiple eicosanoids can be separated and quantitated; in addition, levels before, during, and after therapy for psoriasis may be compared.\r"

Recombinant clones containing elastin sequences were identified by plaque hybridizations with previously characterized human placental elastin cDNAs. Seven positive recombinant clones with inserts of approximately 3.2-2.2 kb were isolated. Characterization of the clones by restriction endonuclease analysis and dot-blot hybridizations with exon-specific synthetic oligonucleotides demonstrated considerable variability in the primary nucleotide sequence. Dideoxy nucleotide sequencing confirmed this finding. The variability is most likely a result of alternative splicing of exons from the primary elastin transcripts. The two largest clones contained approximately 1 kb of 3' untranslated sequence and approximately 2.2 kb of translated sequence encoding 730 amino acids. Six amino acids, encoded by exon 12A, have not been previously noted in human elastin cDNAs. In addition, these human skin fibroblast clones contained a 49 bp 5' untranslated sequence. These results demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the processed nucleotide sequence of the elastin mRNAs. These transcripts may code for isoforms of tropoelastin with different biologic properties.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor promoting phorbol esters, such as 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), when applied topically to mouse skin cause inflammation and hyperplasia. The major cellular phorbol ester receptor is a calcium and phospholipid dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PK-C). PK-C is directly activated by TPA and most of the responses of cells to TPA appear to be mediated by PK-C. This suggests that PK-C may play a key role as a mediator of inflammation and growth in TPA treated mouse skin. Sphingosine has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of PK-C in vitro and in intact leukocytes. We therefore have investigated the effects of sphingosine upon TPA-induced inflammation, hyperplasia, induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and ODC mRNA, and activation of PK-C in mouse skin. The results demonstrate that sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of all of the TPA-induced responses examined. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that PK-C is a major mediator of the phorbol ester response in mouse skin. Furthermore, PK-C inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "Lipids appear to play a critical role as regulators of stratum corneum desquamation. In this study, we observed discrete lipid phase transitions at physiologic temperatures in both normal human scale (NHS) and in lipid extracts of NHS by differential scanning calorimetry. In contrast, such thermal transitions were not observed in recessive x-linked ichthyosis scale (RXLIS). To gain further insight into the molecular basis of the lipid phase transitions in NHS vs. RXLIS, comparable samples were evaluated by electron spin resonance, utilizing the perdeuterated probe, di-t-butyl nitroxide. Upon electron spin resonance analysis, both NHS and RXLIS demonstrated thermal phase transitions in the physiologic range; however, the nature of the lipid environments in each type varied. Whereas the environment of the spin probe was more polar in NHS than in RXLIS, the spin probe partitioned into a more \"fluid\" environment in RXLIS; i.e., the spin probe was more mobile in RXLIS than in NHS lipid matrices. Because an alteration in the cholesteryl sulfate:cholesterol ratio is the primary lipid abnormality in RXLIS, model cholesterol-fatty acid-cholesteryl sulfate mixtures were prepared in proportion to the lipid composition of NHS and RXLIS. Differences were observed in both thermal transitions and in lipid microenvironments in these mixtures that paralleled those observed in scale samples. Based on these results, a model is proposed that invokes abnormal hydrogen bonding, due to increased cholesteryl sulfate, as the mechanism for the abnormal desquamation in recessive X-linked ichthyosis.\r"

Although only a negligible percentage of organisms adhered to albumin-coated PMMA, surface-bound fibronectin significantly promoted adherence of all isolates. Fibrinogen markedly promoted adherence of all S. aureus strains but of only four coagulase-negative strains. Thus, coagulase-negative staphylococci revealed a marked heterogeneity in adherence to fibrinogen-coated surfaces, a result suggesting the existence of heretofore unknown receptors for fibrinogen. Laminin promoted adherence of staphylococci to a much lower extent. Although strain specific, adherence of clinical staphylococcal isolates to foreign surfaces is significantly increased by fibronectin, fibrinogen, and laminin, an observation suggesting the possible contribution of these proteins to the pathogenesis of iv device infection.\r"

Six animals were simultaneously infected with both agents; four became seriously ill (with accompanying proteinuria and edema) and either died or were killed. Histopathology indicated that glomerulonephritis had developed. The two survivors had more-prolonged parasitemia than did animals infected with P. brasilianum alone, as did animals infected with EBV before P. brasilianum. Five of the six simultaneously infected animals had absent or low titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigens when compared with the other EBV-infected animals.

The prevalences of anti-HD and antibody to HIV were 67% and 58%, respectively, and there was no association between positivity for these two markers. In a logistic regression model, anti-HD was associated with older age (P = .001), longer duration of drug abuse (P = .045), and the presence of liver disease (P = .002). Antibody to HIV was associated with a younger age (P = .003) and increased serum globulin levels (P less than .001). In patients infected with HIV, the severity of hepatic dysfunction remained correlated with anti-HD. In anti-HD-positive patients, most indices of hepatic dysfunction were similar whether or not antibody to HIV was present, but serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in patients with both anti-HD and antibody to HIV. (124 +/- 16 vs. 74 +/- 11, P less than .05).\r"

The subgenus A and C strains were from liver, lung, blood, urine, and stool and were unremarkable in their antigenic characteristics. The subgenus B strains were mostly from urine and were serotyped by neutralization (SN) and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) tests as Ad11 (12 isolates), Ad16 (1), Ad35 (3), and Ad21/H21 + 35 (1) plus new intermediate strains 34/H11 (3), 35/H11 (1), and 11 + 35/H11 (2). The subgenus D serotypes from 24 patients were mostly from stool specimens and consisted of 8 isolates of known serotypes, 16 of antigenically intermediate strains, and 11 of five new adenovirus types with distinct antigenic and restriction enzyme characteristics. The new serotypes were described as candidate types 43-47 in accordance with currently accepted taxonomic criteria. Ad45, 46, and 47 showed a major relation by HAI with Ad29, 24, and 20, respectively. Four intermediate types were related to the new serotypes. The plethora of serotypes from patients with AIDS suggests that no epidemiological significance can be attached to any one serotype.\r"

In both outbreaks the age-specific morbidity rate decreased with increasing age. Half (six of 12) of the children six to 27 months of age who were ill with rotavirus in outbreak 1 were ill with rotavirus again in outbreak 2, whereas two were asymptomatically infected; older children who were ill in outbreak 1 were not ill in outbreak 2.

The sperm penetration rate of the test was 100% (6/6) when spermatozoa were treated with the IgG fraction derived from sperm immobilizing antibody-negative serum, whereas it was only 17% (1/6) when spermatozoa were treated with the IgG fraction derived from sperm immobilizing antibody-positive serum. Electron microscopic observation of the sperm immobilizing antibody-negative and -positive serum-treated spermatozoa showed that the number of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa was significantly greater in the sperm immobilizing antibody-negative serum than in the antibody-positive serum. Therefore, it appears that one of the blocking mechanisms of the spermatozoal penetration of the zona pellucida by sperm immobilizing antibodies may be due to inhibition of the acrosome reaction in the spermatozoa.\r"

Thirty-five mature (preovulatory) oocytes, 10 immature oocytes lacking a germinal vesicle, and 11 atretic oocytes which had not undergone fertilization at 10-20 hr after insemination were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Observed through employment of these techniques, the zona pellucida showed two basically different patterns: a mesh-like, spongy structure having wide and/or close meshes; and a compact, smooth surface. The smooth-surfaced zona was most commonly seen in the cultured oocytes belonging to the immature and atretic groups. These observations seem to show that the spongy appearance of the zona pellucida is related mainly to oocyte development and maturity. In this study, greater numbers of penetrating spermatozoa were noted on oocytes showing the mesh-like zona, in contrast to the presence of a few sperm flattened against its surface or the frank absence of sperm associated with oocytes having the more compact, smooth zona. It is likely that the condensation of the outer aspect of the zona pellucida causes a disorientation of sperm-binding sites, which would probably result in markedly reduced binding and penetration capacity with spermatozoa. These changes might ultimately lead to impairment of in vitro oocyte fertilizability.\r"

Using a mouse quality-control culture system, several instrument preparation protocols were reevaluated to determine their efficiency in the control or elimination of potential toxicity. Dilute concentrations of urine and endometrial fluid were also tested. Medium rinsed through laparoscope and aspiration needles failed to support embryo development. This effect was reversed in needles that were pretreated with rinses of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Endometrial fluid demonstrated no obvious toxic effect, but urine-exposed embryos arrested in the two-cell state. The importance of periodic evaluation of materials and their pretreatment before use in in vitro fertilization of human oocytes is essential to ensure control of potentially toxic substances.\r"

  ".W": "The one-cell mouse embryo system has previously been shown to be more sensitive than the two-cell system to mild changes in in vitro fertilization (IVF) culture media. To determine whether this greater sensitivity is related to the developmental stage or to the length of exposure, one-cell embryos were collected and cultured in control media (Ham's F-10, 282 mOsm/liter), in media of altered osmolality (260, 300, and 316 mOsm/liter), or in media containing Cidex diluted 1:100,000. The one-cell embryos were exposed to control or altered media in four patterns: control group--control medium for 96 hr; Group A--altered medium for the first 24 hr followed by control medium for 72 hr; Group B--control medium for the first 24 hr followed by altered medium for 72 hr; and Group C--control medium for the first 24 hr, altered medium for the next 24 hr, and control medium again for 48 hr. The percentage of embryos developing to blastocysts in Group A (exposed to adverse conditions only for the first 24 hr of culture) was significantly lower than in the control group under all conditions studied. In contrast, the percentage of blastocysts developing in Group B was significantly lower than in the control group only in medium of 315 mOsm/liter and was not different from that in controls under the other conditions studied. There was no difference between Group C and the control group. We conclude that the higher sensitivity of the one-cell system is an inherent property of the one-cell stage, as exposure of the embryo during this critical first 24-hr period proved to have the most profound consequences.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the addition of fibrin sealant to a mouse embryo/Ham's F-10 culture medium mixture. There was no statistical difference in the number of blastocysts developing from 138 embryos in standard medium compared with 139 cultured with the addition of fibrin sealant. It is concluded that fibrin sealant is not embryotoxic, and thus following further experimentation its eventual utilization in human in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer programs appears promising.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 26 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles was studied for changes of serum progesterone levels before and after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by a comparison of the number of follicles punctured, number of oocytes recovered, morphological features of oocytes, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, and quality of embryos before their transfer. Subjects were further divided into three groups according to their pregnancy outcome. Five pregnancies were generated and reached the stage of clinical confirmation of live baby delivery or live fetus by ultrasound scanning of the uterine contents. Six patient cycles that had a prolonged luteal phase and beta-hCG levels greater than 40 MIU/ml were described as biochemical pregnancies. Fifteen patient cycles showed no sign of pregnancy. The significant finding of this study is related to the serum progesterone level increase from 20 to 34 hr after hCG injection. The nonpregnancy group yielded a 1.2-fold increase compared with the biochemical pregnancy and pregnancy groups, which had a 3-fold increase. The usage of this multiple effect of progesterone may aid in the prediction of the \"high-quality embryo\" that might result from a given treatment cycle, indicate the completion of luteinization, the proper timing of hCG to induce final oocyte maturation, and the necessary length of preincubation, and aid in the prediction as to whether or not a pregnancy is likely to result.\r"

When recovered at the one-cell stage, the difference in cleavage rate between the groups incubated at 37 and 39 degrees C did not reach significance. While the morphology of the embryos incubated at 37 degrees C did not differ from that of the embryos incubated at 39 degrees C in either group, a significantly higher rate of degeneration was noted in the group of two-cell embryos incubated at 41 degrees C. These findings may apply to the human in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer system (IVF-ET), where the existing \"lag\" between embryo and endometrium could be narrowed if embryo cleavage rates could be accelerated. Further documentation of the normality of these \"advanced\" embryos is required.\r"

Since in our IVF-ET program, we do not freeze the extra embryos available, the purpose of the double transfer was to use all the embryos available and to improve the chances of finding the \"implantation window\" open. It is our feeling that multiple transfers may be beneficial to improve the pregnancy rate in an IVF-ET program without freezing facilities. However, a larger controlled clinical trial is necessary, in order to establish the advantages of multiple transfers in terms of pregnancy rate in comparison with the potential disadvantages.\r"

Although chronic infections are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis, secondary amyloidosis is a rare complication, and during the past 20 years, only 16 cases of amyloidosis in patients with cystic fibrosis have been reported. We examined amyloid fibrils isolated from the spleen of a 25-year-old man who had a history of a chronic cough since infancy and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis at age 6 years. After solubilization in 6 mol/L guanidine and purification by gel filtration, the major component of the amyloid fibrils was a homogeneous 8000 dalton protein that reacted positively with antiserum to human amyloid A (AA) protein. Complete protein sequence analysis was carried out by using the whole protein and fragments obtained by treatment of the protein with cyanogen bromide, lysyl endopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase. The protein contained 76 residues and showed minor heterogeneity when compared with other AA protein sequences. The cystic fibrosis AA protein represents a product of the SAA-specific cDNA clone now known to be the alpha-allelic form of SAA1 in which valine is present at position 52 and alanine is at position 57.\r"

A number of techniques have been described to isolate type II cells for in vitro studies; however, type II cell suspensions isolated by each technique are still contaminated by macrophages or monocytes. The present studies describe the use of flow cytometry to accurately characterize the composition of these cell suspensions. With freshly isolated type II cell suspensions, type II cells could be distinguished from macrophages and monocytes by two methods: (1) the combination of natural fluorescence and orthogonal light scatter, or (2) the use of monoclonal antibodies OX-1 (directed against a common leukocyte antigen present on rat macrophages and monocytes) and PKK-1 (directed against cytokeratin intermediate filaments present in type II cells). With cultured type II cells, the combination of natural fluorescence and orthogonal light scatter did not distinguish between type II cells and macrophages or monocytes; however, the monoclonal antibodies OX-I and PKK-1 continued to distinguish between these cell types. As an example of the use of these techniques, the methods were used to define the sequential expression of class I and II major histocompatibility antigens on both type II cells and on macrophages or monocytes in the same cell preparations. These methods are of potential value in isolating pure populations either of type II cells or of macrophages or monocytes by cell sorting and in accurately identifying the cells present in type II cell suspensions or cultures.\r"

To assess the potential for recovery after cessation of pacing, simultaneous hemodynamic and two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were conducted in nine conscious dogs paced to severe heart failure (4.3 +/- 1.7 weeks). Heart failure was characterized by elevated left and right ventricular filling pressures from 9 +/- 3 and 7 +/- 2 mm Hg to 25 +/- 6 and 15 +/- 3 mm Hg (both p less than 0.01), respectively. Left ventricular cross-sectional area (an estimate of preload) and systolic wall stress (an estimate of afterload) increased from 12 +/- 2 cm2 and 119 +/- 23 10(3) dynes/cm2 to 17 +/- 3 cm2 and 210 +/- 46 10(3) dynes/cm2 (both p less than 0.01), respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 54% +/- 7% to 13% +/- 5% (p less than 0.01). When pacing was discontinued to allow resumption of sinus rhythm, left and right ventricular filling pressures declined rapidly at 48 hours after resumption of sinus rhythm, by 36% and 53%, respectively. Ejection fraction doubled, although left ventricular cross-sectional area and wall stress remained elevated at 48 hours. The recovery of systolic function in the absence of major changes in loading conditions suggests that pacing-induced heart failure is mediated by a decrease in left ventricular contractility. Moreover, the persistent dilation of the left ventricle after cessation of pacing suggests that structural remodeling of the left ventricle occurs during the development of pacing-induced heart failure.\r"

To further understand the mechanism of deferoxamine-induced cytotoxicity, we looked at its effects on cell cycling and on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis by CHP 126, a cell line that is derived from tumor tissue of a patient with a neuroblastoma and that is known to be drug sensitive. After 24 hours of exposure to 60 mumol/L deferoxamine, there was a 35% increase in the percent of cells in the nonproliferating and prereplicative phases of the cell cycle and a corresponding decrease in the percent of cells in the DNA synthesis, postreplicative, and mitotic phases of the cell cycle, results that are consistent with a block of cell cycle progression at the early DNA synthesis phase. The inhibitory effects of deferoxamine on DNA synthesis were confirmed by demonstration of a 60% decrease in thymidine incorporation into DNA in short-term cultures of CHP 126. Effects on RNA and protein synthesis were minimal. Equivalent effects on growth were seen by using several chelators that interact with different iron pools, suggesting that both intracellular and extracellular iron are required for growth of neuroblastoma cells.\r"

Serum bilirubin was primarily bound to a protein fraction with a molecular weight of about 600 x 10(3) or more in NARs. About 39.2% +/- 12.5% of the serum bilirubin during infusion of bilirubin was bound to the same fraction in Gunn rats. Bilirubin was substantially taken up into the liver and excreted into the bile in NARs, suggesting the role of a high molecular protein, probably a lipoprotein, in its blood transport and the hepatic uptake process. In NARs, biliary bilirubin secretion reached the peak between 20 and 40 minutes after the initiation of bilirubin loading and decreased thereafter, whereas it continued to increase in SD rats and in NARs to which albumin was administered 20 minutes after the start of bilirubin loading. Biliary bilirubin fractions before bilirubin loading were similar in SD rats and NARs, whereas an increase in bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) and a decrease in bilirubin diglucuronide (BDG) were observed in Gunn rats. After the initiation of bilirubin loading, a decrease in biliary BDG and an increase in BMG and unconjugated bilirubin were observed in all groups of rats.\r"

  ".W": "Intestinal folic acid transport is a saturable process with a pH optimum of 5.5 to 6.0. Because of the possible effects of antacids and acid-lowering drugs on the pH of the proximal small intestine, the influence of these drugs on folic acid absorption was studied by using tritium-labeled pteroylmonoglutamic acid (PGA) in 30 subjects (21 women, nine men) of 56 to 89 years of age. Both cimetidine and an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide reduced folate absorption from a liquid formula meal (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001, respectively). Although ranitidine also caused a fall in folic acid absorption from the liquid meal, the change was not statistically significantly different from when PGA was given with the meal alone. Both histamine receptor antagonists tended to maintain a high intraluminal pH in the proximal small intestine after meals, which in part could explain the inhibition of folate absorption. However, neither drug was found to chemically interact with folic acid, and neither drug inhibited the dihydrofolate reductase. The antacid was found to precipitate folic acid at a pH of greater than 4.0, thus removing it from the aqueous phase. This appears to be the explanation for the lowered folate absorption in the presence of antacid. Although the effects of these drugs on reducing folic acid absorption were relatively small, such reductions could become clinically significant in chronic antacid or H2 receptor antagonist use or intensive antacid or H2 receptor antagonist use by individuals eating diets that are marginal in folate content.\r"

Lungs were perfused for a 20-minute baseline period with a perfusate equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and ventilated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture. Only very low amounts of oxygen were measurable in this hypoxic perfusate. The lungs were then perfused from a second reservoir containing perfusate equilibrated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 and ventilated with a 95% N2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture. After the period of hypoxia, the lungs were reperfused with the 95% O2 and 5% CO2 equilibrated perfusate and ventilated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture for the remainder of the experiment. Glutathione was measured in the perfusate serially throughout the experiment, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was also measured to assess cell membrane rupture during the infusion. GSSG release remained stable in the baseline and hypoxic period but rose significantly in the reoxygenation period, to concentrations approximately two times basal release. Lung tissue concentrations of GSSC also rose in the reoxygenation period. Decreasing lung glutathione reductase activity by pretreating animals with 1,3-bis-2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) increased GSSG release into the perfusate during reoxygenation. We conclude that GSSG formation and release is increased in the lung during the reoxygenation period after lung hypoxia, suggesting the presence of hydroperoxide and free radical metabolism. These data support the hypothesis that alterations in lung metabolism occur during hypoxia that allow free GSSG formation and release during the reintroduction of oxygen.\r"

The experiments described demonstrate that this may occur through the activation of Hageman factor by this agent. Bismuth subgallate shortened the clotting time of whole blood, an action localized to an effect on the early steps of the intrinsic pathway; bismuth subgallate did not accelerate the thrombin time or prothrombin time of normal plasma, but could be substituted for kaolin as an activator of coagulation in assays of the partial thromboplastin time. The action of bismuth subgallate was localized to an effect on Hageman factor. It did not induce coagulation of plasma samples deficient in any of the recognized factors participating in the intrinsic pathway of thrombin formation, but it shortened the clotting time of plasma deficient in factor VII, a component of the extrinsic pathway. Evidence was obtained that Hageman factor exposed to bismuth subgallate corrected the defect of Hageman factor-deficient plasma and acquired amidolytic properties in the absence of other clotting factors. These studies provide a rationale for the hemostatic properties of bismuth subgallate.\r"

For serotype 1 pneumococci, the level of antibody measured by radioimmunoassay did not predict mouse protection, as has been noted by others. For some sera, opsonic requirements for antibody and complement could be clearly demonstrated and a strong correlation obtained between concentration of antibody and degree of phagocytic killing. However, for most sera, antibody concentration did not correlate with opsonic activity, as measured by phagocytic bactericidal assay or uptake of radiolabeled bacteria. Sera with high concentrations of anticapsular antibody did not always support in vitro bacterial killing by leukocytes. Conversely, highly opsonic sera did not necessarily have substantial levels of measurable antibody. Moreover, in vitro opsonophagocytic activity failed to predict in vivo protection; sera could be opsonic in vitro but not protective in vivo and vice versa. For serotype 3 pneumococci, antibody concentrations correlated strongly with mouse protective titers, as has been noted by others for type 3. Opsonophagocytosis, as measured by leukocyte bactericidal activity, required both complement and heat-stable substance(s) present in high-antibody sera, presumably antibody. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of serum enhanced phagocytic killing in a fashion that could be correlated with anticapsular antibody content. However, correlation with opsonophagocytosis was not so strong as with mouse protection, and there was no correlation between antibody concentration and opsonization as measured by uptake of radiolabeled bacteria. These observations suggest that opsonophagocytosis (with the definitive end point of bacterial killing) cannot be the standard against which to measure antibody concentrations. Furthermore, host protective mechanisms against pneumococci remain to be clearly defined. Even if opsonization by anticapsular antibody is the primary mechanism, there is need for development of improved functional assays of protection.\r"

Based on the results obtained, a grading system was developed and correlated with the neurological outcome. It was concluded that ABR is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool which can provide valuable information about the function of the brain stem in these patients. Inclusion of ABR studies in the head injury management protocol is strongly recommended.\r"

The dye stained the apical cell surface coat and the homogeneous substance in the luminal space of the endolymphatic sac, when introduced from the luminal side of the epithelium. It is suggested that the surface coat and homogeneous substance may play an important part in the endolymph regulatory mechanism in the endolymphatic sac. When ruthenium red was introduced from the subepithelial side, the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells usually became brightly stained in the absence of staining of the apical cell surface, due to the presence of the tight junctions. In some instances, however, the dye penetrated beyond the level of the tight junctions. Pinocytotic vesicles and larger vacuoles in the epithelial cells were also sometimes stained, both apically and near the lateral cell surface. These findings suggest that endolymph efflux mechanisms in the endolymphatic sac may involve the combined actions of a paracellular and transepithelial flow as well as a transcellular, vacuolar bulk flow.\r"

In some places it has been used routinely for decades, in others it has been almost forgotten. A quantitative study of its therapeutic value has been difficult to find. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the therapeutic value of such an 'air douche' in atelectatic ears. Thirteen middle ears with atelectasis were Politzerized daily with air or N2 for up to five consecutive days. Once Politzerized, the atelectasis and retraction pockets disappeared in all the ears examined. However, continuous observation of the Politzerized ears with the surgical microscope revealed that all the ear drums returned swiftly to their retracted position. The time it took for a drum to return to its original place varied from 15 minutes up to a maximum of 335 minutes. Our observations show that even an increased number of Politzerizations did not alter the speed of reappearance of the atelectasis. It would therefore seem that the therapeutic value of Politzerization in atelectatic ears is doubtful.\r"

Two commonly used combinations are lignocaine with adrenaline and prilocaine with felypressin (citanest with octapressin). Most surgeons prefer to use lignocaine with adrenaline but because of the risks of cardiac dysrhythmias when used with halothane anaesthetists prefer prilocaine with felypressin. In a trial with lignocaine 2 per cent and adrenaline 1 in 200,000 against prilocaine 3 per cent and felypressin 0.03 international units/ml in 18 patients undergoing septal surgery with local anaesthesia alone there was significantly less blood loss in the lignocaine with adrenaline group, p less than 0.01. The mean blood loss in the adrenaline group was 7.5 ml. and 32.7 ml. with felypressin. Both combinations were equally effective in producing adequate local anaesthesia. It is concluded that lignocaine with adrenaline is superior to prilocaine with felypressin in achieving a dry operating field in septal surgery under local anaesthesia.\r"

Septoplasty ought to replace the latter as the routine procedure. 10 per cent had troublesome crusting independent of the technique used.

Tumours with lateral extensions into the pterygopalatine or infratemporal fossae or the cheek (Stage IIB), and those with simultaneous superior and lateral spread (Stage III) underwent a transmaxillary excision (19 cases).

Conventional management consists of the administration of intra-muscular opiates prior to the commencement of oral analgesia and is often inadequate, producing variable levels of pain relief. One of the recommended uses of benzocaine lozenges is the relief of throat discomfort following tonsillectomy, but there are no clinical trials to support this claim. Therefore, a prospective placebo controlled trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy of benzocaine lozenges (10 mg.) with standard oral analgesia in the management of post-operative pain following tonsillectomy in an adult population. Consecutive patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy were randomised to receive either benzocaine lozenges (10 mg.) or placebo. Intake of supplementary oral analgesia was recorded, and the level of post-operative pain was assessed by use of a visual linear analogue scale. There was no significant difference in analgesic intake or pain severity as measured by linear analogue between the two groups. These results suggest that there is no benefit in administering benzocaine lozenges for the relief of post-tonsillectomy pain, and its use in this situation cannot be recommended.\r"

In most of these patients, nodes were removed from the main lymphatic drainage pathways and subjected to immediate frozen section examination. The results from frozen section examination of the nodes were then compared with those from the surgical specimens of cervical neck dissections performed on the patients according to the classic rules. In addition, margin resections were made and examined by frozen section after removal of the tumour. In the event of a positive finding, these resections were continued until healthy tissue was reached, the specimens being examined in addition by classic methods. Immediate frozen sections enable the margins of the resection to be verified correctly. In our series we were brought to extend the limits of resection in 10 cases out of 68 (15 per cent). It can also be seen that the accuracy of the pathologist's reading of the frozen sections is satisfactory. The overall level of error is three out of 68 (4.5 per cent). All the errors correspond to false negatives. The aim of avoiding neck dissections in the presence of N0, thanks to nodal selection with frozen section, is not attained. We find a 6/61 rate of false negatives for N0-N1 (10 per cent) when we compare the frozen sections of the selected nodes and the neck dissections. This is due to the fact that the surgeon may be led astray by a reactive hyperplastic node whilst other less inflammatory neighbouring nodes are in fact the site of metastasis.\r"

Forks, Washington, is a remote logging town where family physicians and midlevel practitioners have been the sole providers of labor and delivery services. Forks offers an opportunity to evaluate the quality of an isolated rural family practice obstetric service. A retrospective audit of all labor and delivery patient charts at Forks Community Hospital from 1975 to 1983 was undertaken; 1,052 charts were abstracted with 36 factors of morbidity, mortality, and intervention examined. The results, when compared with similar studies in the literature, provide evidence of good performance. In addition, a relatively high-risk obstetric population was served with favorable outcomes. Family physicians and rural hospitals can provide high-quality obstetrical services.\r"

Letters (1,024) were sent to all patients aged over 50 years who were registered in a community-based family practice residency program. Four hundred twenty-nine responded. Of those who responded, 16.8 percent indicated interest in a rectal examination, 21 percent were interested in testing their stool for occult blood, 13.1 percent desired a sigmoidoscopy, and 11.7 percent indicated that they had previously had a sigmoidoscopy. The following reasons were given by responders who were not interested in sigmoidoscopy: 42 percent felt good and did not perceive a need, 31 percent were concerned about cost, 12.1 percent were concerned about discomfort, and 8.6 percent stated fear as a reason for their response. Of the 56 patients who indicated interest in a sigmoidoscopy, 10 patients had the procedure done (flexible 60-cm sigmoidoscope). Although the ACS recommends that everyone aged over 50 years have a sigmoidoscopy, few patients in this population who responded have had the procedure done. Encouragement and education for patients in colorectal screening, however, is worthwhile. Two colorectal carcinomas were detected as a result of this survey.\r"

Instruments utilized included the Life Experiences Survey, the Family APGAR, the Friends APGAR, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory. Despite the presumed adverse psychological influence of their infertility, Life Experience Survey scores for both men and women did not differ significantly from normative data. Family APGAR scores indicated a high degree of satisfaction with family function. Friends APGAR scores were somewhat lower than normative data. The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, a measure of perception regarding factors influencing health outcomes, was unremarkable. The Eysenck Personality Inventory revealed a lower score on the neuroticism scale for the men. These psychosocial results were surprisingly normal.\r"

Of the patients expressing a preference, 96 percent preferred that their physician address them by first name while 87 percent noted that this gesture actually occurred. Forty percent of the patients preferred to address the physician by first name while 14 percent actually did so. These findings suggest that physicians can feel comfortable addressing almost all of their patients by first name and that many of their patients may desire to address them by their first name. It is suggested that the physician at the time of the patient's first visit clarify the manner in which each addresses the other.\r"

Psychiatric evaluations mandated by law necessitate several guidelines different from those of the usual doctor/patient relationship.

The synthetic substrate 4-trifluoromethylcoumarin phosphate was impregnated into cellulose diacetate membranes and air-dried overnight. After isoelectric focusing, the substrate overlay membrane was rehydrated in 0.05M citrate buffer, pH 4.0, lightly blotted, and overlayed on the gel. A 5- to 10-min incubation at 37 degrees C produced intensely fluorescing, light-blue bands on the diacetate membrane. Interaction of the trifluoromethyl group on the substrate with hydrophobic regions of the diacetate membrane impeded diffusion, yielding a permanent zymogram. There were no discrepancies in phenotype determinations using this method when compared with the 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate assay approach. Further, an increased number of conclusive calls were obtained (91.8 versus 79.5% and 54.1 versus 34.9%) with this new assay when compared with the 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate substrate on known liquid bloods and questioned dried bloodstains, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "In order to induce a non-lethal infection restricted to central aminergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulbs a series of temperature sensitive (ts) and G-protein monoclonal antibody escape mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were instilled into the nasal cavity of mice. In three-week (wk)-old NMRI mice four monoclonal antibody escape mutants caused an extensive infection of the olfactory epithelium and, like a wild type strain, a lethal brain infection after spread along olfactory pathways. Three ts mutant strains showed an attenuated pathogenic potential. Strain G31 caused a lethal infection with a somewhat prolonged course while the strain G11 failed to invade the nervous system. Strain G41 showed minimal invasion of central nervous system in three-wk-old mice and caused a lethal infection in newborn and one-wk-old mice. In contrast, two-wk-old mice survived infection with this mutant, which spread along olfactory pathways and rather selectively affected aminergic reticular core neurons in the diagonal band, the locus ceruleus and the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. Thus, an age-dependent virus infection of the olfactory pathways can cause restricted lesions in the brain providing a model for studies of virus-induced changes in aminergic neurotransmission.\r"

In this investigation we examined the changes in the BL in a neurological mutant of the rat previously characterized as having BL anomalies which progress to aqueductal stenosis and prenatal hydrocephalus. Embryos were obtained from matings of rats homozygous for the prenatal hydrocephalus gene or from controls, both originally derived from the same Wistar albino stock. On days 12 and 13 of development, embryos were processed for indirect immunofluorescence localization of BL components type IV collagen or laminin. Additional whole litters were processed for ultrastructural analysis of neuroepithelial and BL morphology. In control embryos, neuroepithelial BL components formed a smooth linear boundary to the basal surface of the neuroepithelium. This unbroken border was interrupted only in regions of active neural crest cell migration (day 12), and in areas of imminent vascularization (day 13). In hydrocephalic embryos on the 12th day there were gaps in the continuity of the BL and an apparent reduction in deposition of type IV collagen. By day 13, blood vessels had prematurely colonized the neuroepithelium, few BL breaks were observed, and deposition of type IV collagen appeared similar to that seen in control embryos. Ultrastructurally, a similar pattern of change was observed. The neuroepithelium of control embryos was uniformly bounded by an organized BL consisting of a lamina lucida subjacent to the plasma membrane, and a lamina densa which merged with scattered collagen fibrils in the mesenchymal compartment. On day 12, the BL of hydrocephalic embryos had large gaps through which neuroepithelial cells projected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Associated with the 30% mean reduction in brain weight in HD patients (p less than 0.001) were significantly smaller overall cross-sectional areas of brain at all five levels studied, with striking losses in cerebral cortex (21-29%), white matter (29-34%), caudate (57%), putamen (64%), and thalamus (28%) (all p less than 0.005). In addition, the ventricular system was dilated up to 2.5 times normal at CAP, GP, and LGN levels, 9.5 times normal at the OCP level, and 13 times normal at the AF level. Higher grades of severity of HD had greater reductions in the cross-sectional area of the caudate, putamen, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (p less than 0.005-0.001), and larger ventricles (p = 0.08) compared to lower (less severe) grades of HD. The findings confirm and quantitate the severe atrophy of the neostriatum, in addition to demonstrating a severe loss of cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter in HD. The global atrophy of cerebral cortex and white matter observed in all degrees of HD may account for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments which often precede the onset of chorea.\r"

  ".W": "The macromolecular structure of the axon membrane in 26-28-day-old Jimpy mice and control optic nerve were examined with quantitative freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Premyelinated and myelinated axons were observed in control optic nerves, with axonal diameters of premyelinated axons being generally smaller than that of myelinated axons (approximately 0.2-0.4 micron vs approximately 0.5-1.5 micron, respectively). Axon membrane from control optic nerves exhibited an asymmetrical partitioning of intramembranous particles (IMP). P-faces of internodal membrane displayed nearly twice as many IMP as the premyelinated axolemma (1,731 vs 893 micron-2, respectively). E-faces of internodal and premyelinated axolemma exhibited IMP densities of 124 and 157 micron-2, respectively. Few myelinated axons were apparent in optic nerves from Jimpy mice. The amyelinated axons of Jimpy mice displayed a spectrum of axonal diameters, ranging from approximately 0.2 to 1.5 micron. P-face densities of amyelinated axons, considered as a group, exhibited a wide range (600-2,100 micron-2). However, large diameter (greater than or equal to 0.5 micron) axons exhibited a significantly greater P-face IMP density than that of small caliber (greater than 0.5 micron) axons (1,525 vs 1,032 micron-2, respectively). Aggregations of E-face IMP were not observed along amyelinated axons of Jimpy optic nerves. The results demonstrate that the changes in P-face IMP density that occur during development of normal myelinated axons also occur in developing axons of Jimpy optic nerve, irrespective of a lack of normal glial cell association, and provide further evidence that the primary defect of hypomyelination within Jimpy mice is not attributed to the neuron.\r"

On average myelin areas, relative to axon size, were smaller in oxygen-deprived than in control rats. Also myelin spiral length and the number of myelin lamellae relative to axon area were smaller. These findings suggest that hypoxia retards myelinated fiber diameter and especially myelin development.\r"

In abnormal embryos, regional differences in the distribution of the surface coat were comparable to those in normal embryos. However, there was an abnormally acute medial bending of the neural folds, as well as a delay in closure of the posterior neuropore. In closed areas of the abnormal embryos the dorsum also showed an erratic knot of disorganized cells. Thus, the pathogenetic mechanism in this mutant appears to involve not only a failure in apposition in open areas, as well as an inappropriate association of cells in areas which do fuse, but possibly also a failure of proper alignment of neural fold apices prior to apposition and fusion.\r"

  ".W": "In aged human beings and in individuals with age-associated degenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurons develop cytoskeletal abnormalities, including neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP). Senile plaques occur in several nonhuman species; however, NFT, with ultrastructural or immunocytochemical similarities to those occurring in humans, have not been identified in other mammals. In this study of five aged bears (Ursus, 20-30 years of age), we identified cytoskeletal abnormalities similar to those occurring in humans. An aged Asiatic brown bear had NFT, composed of straight 10-16-nm filaments, that were immunoreactive with antibodies directed against: phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments (NF); tau; A68 (a protein enriched in AD); and an antigen associated with paired helical filaments (PHF). An aged polar bear had numerous SP; neurites of these plaques were immunoreactive with antibodies against phosphorylated epitopes of NF, but NFT were not identified. These results indicate that nonprimate species develop age-related cytoskeletal abnormalities similar to those occurring in humans. Investigations of the comparative pathology of aged mammals may be useful in elucidating the pathogeneses of these abnormalities.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies directed to P+ NF immunostained five to ten times more neuronal perikarya in ALS than in age-matched controls. Spheroids, which are NF containing axonal enlargements, found in significantly greater number in proximal axons in ALS, were also intensely immunostained with Mab to P+ NF. Moreover, anterior root axons in five of eleven cases of ALS reacted only with the Mab to P+ NF, while both P- and P+ NF were present in motor roots from controls. In control groups, the number of neuronal perikarya and spheroids that immunoreacted with the Mab to P+ NF increased moderately with age. Chromatolytic lower motor neurons were recognized by Mab to P+ NF. Our results show that the process of phosphorylation is altered in ALS. We propose that phosphorylation of NF in ALS occurs prematurely and that it is more likely to be associated with an impairment of NF transport than to be part of a chromatolytic reaction of lower motor neurons.\r"

The unique and characteristic neuropathological finding were many foamy spheroid bodies (FSB) in the substantia nigra which sometimes contained varying numbers of fine or coarse eosinophilic granules. Ultrastructurally, the FSB contained various small electron-dense granules and/or membranous structures quite different from so-called spheroids (axonal swellings). Bodian staining demonstrated that some FSB were situated within the bundles of the neuronal processes, suggesting that the FSB has originated from the degeneration of the axon and/or dendrites in the substantia nigra.\r"

The knowledge of physicians as a synthesis of their own and other clinicians' experience is simulated with methods of artificial intelligence by setting up two data banks. In one data bank, selected information on the correlation between initial clinical parameters, on the one hand, and mortality, outcome and complications, on the other, from about 250 neurological publications is stored, taking into consideration the therapeutic regimens applied. A second data bank receives clinical and laboratory data profiles of a patient population which has already been treated. The expert system is able to compare the individual initial findings with the corresponding parameter combination stored in the data banks regarding the decision for therapy of a patient to be treated. This enables both calculation of the probable complications and prediction of the expected outcome in relation to various possible forms of therapy. The expert system can thus indicate the kind of therapy where the lowest number of complications and the best outcome can be expected, thus supporting the decision of the physician. As each new patient is treated, the volume of stored information increases, so the system possesses self-learning characteristics. To check the validity of the prognoses, the outcome estimated by the expert system for 51 patients with spontaneous SAH was compared with the actual outcome, and a high level of agreement was attained.\r"

In order to investigate the brain structures involved, magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 20 patients. Neuropsychological assessment included the WAIS and WMS subtests information, picture completion, similarities, digit span, logical memory, and paired associate learning. All patients with severely impaired memory functions (n = 5) showed bilateral lesions in the medial temporal lobe, whereas in those patients with moderate (n = 10) or no measurable impairment of memory testing (n = 5) either no lesions were seen in the medial temporal lobes or these lesions were restricted to one side. A post hoc cluster analysis strikingly confirmed these results. The differences could not be related to the age of the patients, the disease duration, or the level of education. Extensive lesions in the white matter of the frontal lobes, thinning and lining of the corpus callosum, and bilateral involvement of the anterior cingulate gyrus had no bearing on the neuropsychological results. These findings indicate that bilateral demyelination in the hippocampal regions is the most likely explanation for the impairment of anterograde memory in such patients.\r"

The neurological abnormalities included subacute weakness of the limbs and loss of deep reflexes, which improved after the surgical removal of the uterine carcinoma. Neuropathologically, peripheral nerves mainly presented features of axonal degeneration with a mild loss of myelinated fibres. Anterior horns of the spinal cord showed central chromatolysis of the motor nerve cells and many spheroids without neuronal loss. Axonopathy of peripheral nerves was considered to be the main pathological process in this paraneoplastic syndrome.\r"

Surgery revealed a histologically verified grade II astrocytoma. This case is consistent with recent evidence that questions the distinction between the two forms of enchondromatosis (Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome). Maffucci's syndrome is associated with a high rate of malignancy, including intracranial gliomas. Ollier's disease has not been associated with malignant change, other than sarcomatous transformation of the enchondromas. However, Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome may be a spectrum of the same disease process, and therefore patients with diagnosed Ollier's disease are at a higher risk for malignancy than has been previously recognized.\r"

These Philadelphia (Ph)-negative, bcr rearrangement-positive CML patients had clinical features and laboratory parameters that bore a strong resemblance to those of Ph-positive CML; all patients have shown a favorable response to hydroxyurea, busulphan, or alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) therapy. In one patient, because of the deletion of distal 3' sequences, detection of bcr rearrangement required a large probe that recognized proximal 5' sequences. Cells obtained from five patients were studied by Northern blotting and showed an aberrant 8 kilobase (kb) mRNA indistinguishable from the bcr-abl transcript that is felt to be a pathogenetic factor in Ph-positive CML. In three patients with a normal karyotype, bcr rearrangement was detected at the time of hematologic remission, and represented the only evidence for persistent malignancy. Our results suggest that: (1) the presence of bcr rearrangement in CML is associated with clinical features of Ph-positive disease, even in the absence of the Ph chromosome; (2) deletions occur within bcr and necessitate the use of probes covering both 5' and 3' DNA segments for accurate diagnosis; (3) molecular analysis may provide a useful approach to the follow-up of leukemia therapy in some patients; and (4) these patients respond to hydroxyurea, busulphan, and IFN-alpha therapy.\r"

The 14-year actuarial FFR and survival were 82% and 93%, respectively, with a median follow-up time of 9 years. Mediastinal size was the only factor that predicted for a lower FFR, P less than .001. Forty-nine patients have developed recurrent HD. Thirty-six patients are disease-free following retreatment and only 13 patients have died of HD. Patients with mixed cellularity (MC) histology were more likely to relapse below the diaphragm (11%) as compared with patients with nodular sclerosis (NS) (5.1%) or lymphocyte predominant (LP) (3.6%) histology. These relapses were often associated with bulky pelvic nodal adenopathy and salvage treatment with chemotherapy alone often failed to control recurrent disease. Alternative diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are presented for these patients. Thyroid abnormalities represented the most common long-term complication with an actuarial risk at 16 years of 37%. Major complications were rare. Mantle and paraaortic irradiation is associated with a high FFR and a low risk of complications and should remain standard treatment for early-stage HD.\r"

Patients received adjuvant CISCA chemotherapy if they had pathological findings that were thought to predict for high likelihood of relapse. These included the presence of resected nodal metastases, extravesicular involvement of tumor, lymphatic/vascular permeation of the primary tumor, or pelvic visceral invasion. Sixty-two patients at a similar high risk for recurrence did not receive adjuvant CISCA chemotherapy because they refused, had medical contraindications to therapy, or were not referred for chemotherapy. Two-hundred six patients had a cystectomy performed during the same study period but had none of the poor prognostic features suggesting a high risk for relapse. Sixty-two percent of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy are alive and disease-free for a mean follow-up of 118 weeks (range, 28 to 310 weeks). A survival advantage exists for the adjuvant-treated patients when compared with those with unfavorable pathological findings who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (70% v 37%) (P = .00012): no difference exists in long-term disease-free survival for those with favorable pathological findings (long-term disease-free survival 76%) v those who received adjuvant chemotherapy (70%) (P = .33). Adjuvant CISCA chemotherapy prolongs the disease-free survival of some patients following a cystectomy. Patients who benefitted from adjuvant CISCA chemotherapy included those with resected nodal metastases, extra-vesicular involvement of tumor, and direct invasion of the pelvic viscera. Patients not benefitting from adjuvant CISCA chemotherapy in this analysis included those with lymphatic/vascular invasion in their primary tumor as the sole manifestation of high risk for relapse.\r"

Eighteen percent of the patients presented with seizures. Of the remaining patients, 40% received prophylactic anticonvulsants (diphenylhydantoin [DPH] in greater than 90%). Ten percent developed late seizures at an interval from the diagnosis of ICM ranging from 1 to 59 weeks. No patient with a posterior fossa lesion developed seizure; conversely, patients with evidence on initial examination of cerebral hemispheric dysfunction had a higher incidence of late seizure development. The incidence of seizure was virtually identical in patients who received DPH compared with those in whom it was withheld, although two thirds of patients who developed seizure while on DPH had a serum anticonvulsant level that was subtherapeutic. Based on the above findings and until prospective data become available, we recommend that anticonvulsants be withheld in newly-diagnosed patients with ICM until the first seizure.\r"

The tumor recurrences were local (original site) in 14 patients, and occurred at other sites in the brain in the remaining seven. Time to CNS recurrence ranged from 3 to 30 months. At time of repeat craniotomy, disease was limited to the CNS in 12 (57%) of the patients. Median survival following second craniotomy was 9 months, and the actuarial 2-year survival was 25%. Neurological improvement was seen in two thirds of the patients; the median duration of neurological improvement was 6 months. There was no mortality, and only one patient developed increased deficit following surgery. We conclude that repeat resection of brain metastases is an important therapeutic option in selected patients, and should be considered in symptomatic patients with accessible mass lesions before the use of other experimental treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients were entered into a phase I trial to evaluate toxicity, antitumor effects, and biological responses at tumor sites during treatment of R24, an immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GD3 ganglioside. Toxicity was related to dose of R24. Urticaria and pruritus were the most prominent side effects, with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurring at the highest dose levels. Partial responses were observed in four patients lasting from 6 to 46 weeks, and mixed responses were seen in two patients. Responses occurred as early as 4 weeks and as late as 10 weeks after beginning treatment. Twenty of the 21 patients developed human IgG antibodies against R24. Antimouse Ig antibodies were first detected at a median of 14 days after starting treatment, but three of the four patients who had a partial response developed the antimouse Ig responses later than 20 days. Peak serum levels of R24 were related to dose and ranged from a mean of 0.9 micrograms/mL at the lowest dose level (1 mg/m2/d) to 44 micrograms/mL at the highest dose (50 mg/m2/d). The amount of R24 reaching tumor sites corresponded to the dose administered, and R24 could be detected in tumors as late as 30 days after finishing treatment. Inflammation at tumor sites was observed during treatment. Biopsies of tumors taken before, during, and after treatment revealed that R24 induced deposition of complement components, increased numbers of mast cells with mast cell degranulation, and infiltration of T lymphocytes. These results suggest that treatment with R24 can produce a localized inflammatory response at tumor sites that is capable of producing tumor regression.\r"

Pelvic ultrasound and/or computed tomography (CT) identified anatomic abnormalities in the adnexal region in six women in whom there was discernible pelvic accumulation(s) of NP-59. In the remaining three patients testosterone levels were normal or only slightly elevated and the NP-59 scan did not demonstrate abnormal adrenal or pelvic uptake. CT and/or ultrasound studies failed to demonstrate an abnormality in the pelvis suggesting excessive peripheral conversion or abnormal end organ sensitivity of androgen precursors as potential etiologies of their HA. In three women with androgen secreting lipoid tumors of the ovary, unilateral, pelvic NP-59 activity was noted; these tumors were subsequently resected. Two women with bilateral pelvic NP-59 uptake were later shown to have hyperthecosis with markedly asymmetric and enlarged ovaries. In one woman the extent of asymmetric NP-59 uptake was anticipated by the asymmetry of ovarian vein androgen levels at selective venous catheterization. In another woman with markedly asymmetric polycystic ovary disease, intense focal uptake of NP-59 localized to the side of the anatomically abnormal, enlarged ovary. Thus, our preliminary study reviews our experience to date and suggests that NP-59 scintigraphy may be used to localize both tumorous and nontumorous ovarian dysfunction in states of HA and virilization.\r"

We performed combined [99mTc]MDP bone scans and indium-111 (111In) leukocyte studies on 35 patients who had radiographic evidence of neuropathic foot disease and clinically suspected osteomyelitis. The [111In]leukocyte study determined if there was an infection and the bone scan provided the anatomic landmarks so that the infection could be localized to the bone or the adjacent soft tissue. Seventeen patients had osteomyelitis and all showed increased [111In]leukocyte activity localized to the bone, giving a sensitivity of 100%. Among the 18 patients without osteomyelitis, eight had no accumulation of [111In]leukocytes, seven had the [111In]leukocyte activity correctly localized to the soft tissue, two had [111In]leukocyte activity mistakenly attributed to the bone, and one had [111In]leukocyte accumulation in a proven neuroma which was mistakenly attributed to bone. These three false-positive results for osteomyelitis reduced the specificity to 83%. Considering only the 27 patients with a positive [111In]leukocyte study, the combined bone scan and [111In]leukocyte study correctly localized the infection to the soft tissues or bone in 89%. Uninfected neurotrophic osteoarthropathy does not accumulate [111In]leukocytes. We found the combined bone scan and [111In] leukocyte study useful for the detection and localization of infection to soft tissue or bone in patients with neuropathic foot disease.\r"

The monomers and pentamers of certain MoAbs were studied. Human distribution studies were also performed. The serum containing [111In]MoAb was obtained from one of the patients 24 hr after administration and injected into mice which were then killed and assayed for 111In distribution. In general, the [75Se] and [111In]MoAbs had distribution and kinetic patterns that were similar while the 125I-labeled MoAbs dehalogenated after 4 hr. Monomers and pentamers had highly similar distributions suggesting that the distribution of IgMs may be based on factors other than molecular size. The murine IgM showed a somewhat different distribution in mice than did human IgMs. Serum from the patient containing [111In]MoAb had a distribution in mice similar to that of the patient with high liver and gastrointestinal uptake. The human imaging indicates that it is possible to target tumor with human IgM MoAbs, but significant problems remain in regard to their clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which [99mTc]pertechnetate becomes attached to stannous-primed red blood cells are not known in detail. To study the problem further, the effect of red cell surface charge on labeling efficiency was evaluated. Red cell surface charge was reduced by using the enzyme neuraminidase to remove the terminal charge-bearing sialic acid moiety of the membrane glycoprotein. Forty-five blood samples from six volunteers were treated with neuraminidase for varying lengths of time, resulting in the removal of from 11% to 99% of the normal negative surface charge, as determined from electrophoretic mobility measurements. There was excellent linear correlation between labeling efficiency and the remaining red cell surface charge for values down to 20% of normal (r = 0.89). When surface charge was less than 20% of normal, labeling efficiency was constant at 30%. Eleven blood samples from three donors were divided into two groups that were treated with neuraminidase either before or after they were labeled. The labeling efficiency was independent of the order in which the steps were performed. No evidence for shifting of the radiolabel from the cell membrane to hemoglobin was found. The results suggest that clinical conditions associated with a reduction of sialic acid on the erythrocyte membrane may be one cause of decreased red blood cell labeling efficiency, and that increased membrane permeability for reduced technetium species may be responsible for the decrease.\r"

Graded upright bicycle exercise was performed to the point of exhaustion with the volunteer positioned with his/her back to the scintillation camera and data recording was synchronized to the pedal cycle to minimize patient motion artifacts within the data. The first image from each level of exercise was analyzed by placing regions of interest over the spleen, liver, kidneys, and right lung. The counts in each organ were expressed as a percent of activity at zero workload. Analysis of data using Hotelling's t-squared analysis to see if overall differences existed between the last four measurements (up to the time of exhaustion) regarding percent change from baseline for spleen, kidney, liver, and right lung were made. The splanchnic bed had a significant decrease in blood volume. The spleen decreased 39%, while the liver decreased 14%. For the kidney and liver, no significant differences were achieved (p greater than 0.24, p less than 0.15, respectively). The lung increased its blood volume to 128% of control, significant with p less than 0.02. This data demonstrates that in healthy volunteers there is normal redistribution of blood volume during maximal exercise with a significant reduction in blood volume of the spleen as well as a significant rise in blood volume within the lungs.\r"

We have studied the content of gamma-emitting radioisotopes in the thyroid glands of a normal population from southern Sweden using measurements of samples taken at autopsy. The first samples are from a person who died on April 27, 1986. This report contains results for 131I and 133I. The time-activity curve for 131I shows an immediate uptake with a maximum 18-26 days after the accident. No measurable levels were observed after 93 days. We have found that the increase in dose equivalent to the thyroid for the population of southern Sweden due to the released 131I and 133I will be less than 0.1 mSv. This may lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer of 0.1% during a period of 25 yr.\r"

The SSU Observation Area has met the primary objectives by providing a quality, cost-efficient alternative to the use of existing inpatient and emergency department services. Alternatives, such as the SSU, require three major components to succeed: A risk-taking environment. Innovative nursing leaders, especially at the department head level. Staff nurses who demonstrate flexibility, enthusiasm, and pride in expanding their professional roles. The SSU was not developed without difficulty or some conflict. As the program was developing, full-time night coverage was not warranted so an on-call system was used. Increased use of the SSU resulted in the on-call person frequently being called in rather than just occasionally being called. Staff discontent grew as this continued. Additional night staff were added and use continued to increase, which ensured financial viability. Nursing leaders are developing alternatives in every setting. As we learn from each other, the opportunities for change grows.\r"

  ".W": "The two behaviorally oriented evaluation systems have as their major disadvantage the cost and difficulty of devising appropriate instruments. Their development can be time consuming and their use may require a separate instrument for each job category or subcategory being evaluated. Obviously there are different behaviors required of admitting clerks versus food service workers, hence requiring different evaluative tools. Furthermore, the required behaviors of surgical nurses and pediatric nurses will differ, requiring specially designed instruments. However, once the instrument is developed, the use of the behaviorally oriented evaluations will give a superior result. Since the instrument is specifically job related and less subjective in its scoring, the results of the evaluation better reflect the employees' actual performance and are more likely to stand up in court. Furthermore, since the orientation is toward behaviors rather than characteristics, the evaluation is less likely to be perceived as a personal attack by the individual receiving a substandard evaluation. Therefore, it serves as a better basis for improving performance since it identifies specific activities that need correction rather than personal characteristics that must change. Finally, the behaviorally oriented instrument may be seen as a much fairer evaluative tool by employees since they frequently have input into its development and can see that the behaviors measured are directly related to the accomplishment of job objectives. Likewise, employees will view the tool as fairer since it is much easier to challenge adverse scores based on objective evaluations than on those subjectively based.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors examined the relationships of \"patient request fulfillment\" to patient compliance, glycemic control, and several other health care outcomes in 51 adult outpatients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. On average, patients retrospectively cited 4.5 long-term requests, of which over three-fourths were fulfilled. Fulfillment of these requests was significantly associated with patient satisfaction, perceived health status, fewer insulin reactions, and greater insulin injection time reliability (p less than 0.05), but not with several other measures of compliance. Higher patient request fulfillment at single visits was correlated, as hypothesized, with subsequent reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin, but this association was not statistically significant. These results suggest that patient request fulfillment is associated with several aspects of health behavior and health status in adults with insulin-dependent diabetes. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations and determine whether strategies to enhance patient request fulfillment can enhance health care outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective study compares the nasal and maxillary vermillion morphology in three groups of patients who underwent maxillary osteotomies and whose soft tissues were managed by different surgical techniques. Eleven of these patients had simple primary closure (SPC) of the maxillary circumvestibular incision; ten were treated with single V-Y closure (SVY) combined with nasolabial muscle reconstruction, and the remaining 11 were treated with a double V-Y closure (DVY) combined with nasolabial muscle reconstruction. All three groups showed significant increases in the alar dome width. Further inspection of the data revealed that the DVY group showed significant, strong correlations between the preoperative and postoperative vertical vermillion measurements. Although the SVY and SPC techniques showed significant correlations for the same measurements, their correlation values were less. Small significant decreases averaging from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm were seen in all but one of the vertical vermillion measurements with the DVY technique. Larger individual decreases and increases were seen with the SVY and SPC techniques. These findings suggest a level of predictability in the postoperative vermillion height change with the DVY closure that is not obtainable with the SVY or SPC techniques.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzed the development of bacterial endocarditis following dental extraction in rats with periodontal disease. Periodontal disease was produced in rats by tying silk ligatures around the two maxillary first molars, and placing the animals on a high sucrose diet. Sterile aortic valve vegetations were produced by means of a transaortic catheter, and 24 hours later the maxillary first molars were extracted. The animals were killed 72 hours after the extractions. In rats with periodontal disease induced for 10 and 14 weeks, extractions resulted in an incidence of bacterial endocarditis of 24% and 50%, respectively, most of which were due to streptococcal species (two were caused by Staphylococcus [corrected] aureus). The difference, though not statistically significant (p = 0.10, chi 2 with Yates correction), shows a trend toward increased incidence of endocarditis with increasing severity of periodontal disease. This model demonstrates that one can reliably induce bacterial endocarditis after dental extractions in rats with periodontal disease.\r"

The oblique lateral transcranial projection was more accurate than lateral tomography, possibly because identification of measurement points in lateral tomography was complicated by the substantial displacement of the condyle.\r"

Patients who performed the forced expiratory technique alone had mean annual rates of decline that were significantly different from zero for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p less than 0.001), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (p less than 0.001), and Shwachman clinical score (p less than 0.004). In the group performing conventional physiotherapy with percussion and postural drainage, only the mean annual rate of decline for forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity was significantly different from zero (p less than 0.03), and it was significantly different from the mean rate of decline associated with the forces expiratory technique alone (p less than 0.04). We conclude that conventional chest physiotherapy should remain a standard component of therapy in cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Examining the psychologic risks of court and related interventions on child sexual abuse victims. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study with follow-up at 5 months. SETTING: Eleven county social service departments in central North Carolina. SUBJECTS: 100 sexually abused children, ages 6 to 17 years, were recruited from consecutive referrals by social service departments; 75 completed the study. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using a structured psychiatric inventory, the Child Assessment Schedule, we found a high degree of distress at referral. The level of distress fell by 26% over the next 5 months (p less than 0.001). The 33 children not involved in criminal proceedings improved 30%, in comparison with a 17% improvement in the 22 children waiting for the proceedings (p = 0.042). The 12 children who had testified in juvenile court improved 42% on the Anxiety subscale, in comparison with a 17% improvement in all other subjects (p less than 0.01). With mathematical modeling that controlled for the factors of vaginal or anal penetration, the relationship to the perpetrator, an estimate of verbal IQ, duration of abuse, and whether counseling was received, it was estimated that children waiting for court proceedings at the follow-up examination were only one twelfth as likely to have improved by one standard deviation on the Depression subscale (p less than 0.05). A second model revealed that children who testified in juvenile court were 20.11 times more likely to improve by one standard deviation on the CAS Anxiety subscale (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Testimony in juvenile court may be beneficial for the child, whereas protracted criminal proceedings may have an adverse effect on the mental health of the victim.\r"

Of the 67 patient, 31 were randomly assigned to receive the dextrose-containing solution (DS + D) and 36 DS without dextrose. On admission to the hospital, the two groups of patients were similar with respect to enteric pathogens detected, proportion with hyponatremia, magnitude of dehydration as assessed by clinical criteria, serum protein or creatinine concentration, and plasma glucose levels. At the end of the 4-hour infusion, both groups of patients had similar decreases in serum creatinine and protein levels and similar volume of urine output, but patients receiving DS + D had a significantly higher plasma glucose level than patients receiving DS (7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dl) vs 5.39 mmol/L (97 mg/dl), P less than 0.01). One patient in the DS group had hypoglycemia (plasma glucose 2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl) at 4 hours. No other complications were noted. Serum protein values 24 hours after admission were little changed from 4-hour values, suggesting that rehydration was complete at the end of 4 hours. We conclude that, in our patients, rehydration can be carried out safely and rapidly with the use of a single solution and that adding 139 mmol/L (25 gm/L) of dextrose to the solution can prevent hypoglycemia without producing an osmotic diuresis.\r"
