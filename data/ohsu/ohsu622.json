  ".W": "This paper discusses two of the problems encountered when a decision not to institutionalize patients is made. When patient, physician, and family jointly decide to forego institutionalization, the family often subconsciously fears communal censure if it fails to call for help when the end is near. This may, at the last moment, prompt some families to call emergency teams and thwart the original purpose of the decision. Instances in which a previous decision not to institutionalize is justifiably interrupted, are discussed. Such an interruption does not necessarily foil the original plan if it is transient and one to provide comfort. An interactive model in which patients, health-care workers, families, and the community share is used. It is suggested that when a decision not to institutionalize is well-discussed, compassionately made, and carefully implemented, it may itself tend to reshape the communal ethos. As a result, communities, rather than expecting reflex action, are more prone to examine the appropriateness of institutionalization or emergency measures in particular cases and under particular circumstances.\r"

  ".U": "89054857\r", 
  ".W": "The first born offspring of first-cousin parents was affected with a keratinization disorder thought to be nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE). In each of three subsequent pregnancies, the parents elected to have prenatal diagnosis based on evaluation of fetal skin biopsies. The epidermis of fetus 1 was identical to normal 21-wk estimated gestation age (EGA) fetal epidermis, but because keratinization begins normally around 24 wk EGA, the procedure was repeated 4 wk later. A thin epidermis with a few layers of stratum corneum indicated a normal fetus and a healthy infant was born at term. Skin biopsy samples from fetus 2 gave conflicting results; the epidermis of one sample appeared normal but the second had 5-15 layers of incompletely keratinized cells superficial to basal and intermediate layers. The hair canals of both samples were hyperkeratotic. Pelleted amniotic fluid cells contained aggregates of incompletely keratinized epidermal cells and concentric rings of keratinized cells. The fetus was thought to be affected and the pregnancy terminated. Regional variation in epidermal thickness and keratinization was noted upon gross examination of the fetus and by histology of the skin. Marked hyperkeratinization of follicles was evident in all regions. No abnormal keratins were expressed in the affected epidermis but epidermal lipids analyzed from two body regions had a lower triglyceride content and a higher content of free sterols compared with age-matched, normal fetal epidermis. Immunolabeling for markers of differentiation revealed variable stages of epidermal differentiation according to region. Four structurally identical biopsy samples were obtained from a third fetus. The epidermis appeared normal for age and hair canals were keratinized to various extents. The pregnancy was continued and at 33 wk a male infant was born with a severe ichthyosis of the face and scalp and fine, white scaling on the body. The epidermis of both the severely and mildly affected regions of the newborn had a thick, compact stratum corneum and other features of CIE. Scars from all four fetal biopsies were identified on the trunk, in areas which appeared less affected clinically. This study reports, for the first time, the criteria for prenatal diagnosis of CIE and the variable expression of this disorder in the midtrimester fetus. More importantly, it demonstrates the risks and pitfalls of this in utero diagnosis based on epidermal morphology.\r"

The library was screened using a radiolabeled nucleic acid probe prepared from a sheep wool, Type I keratin cDNA clone (SWK2). Clone MHKA-1 was shown to contain a mouse hair, Type I keratin cDNA insert by positive hybridization-selection translation assay, and by the corresponding deduced amino acid sequence. The size of the cDNA insert is 1585 bp (excluding homopolymer tails) and on the basis of Northern blot analysis it corresponds to a mRNA of approximately 1.6 Kb. The cloned cDNA sequence includes the entire coding region for a protein of 416 amino acids (including the initiation methionine). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of sheep wool, Type I keratin (8c1) reveals an overall corresponding sequence identity of 87%. In contrast, the MHKA-1 protein is significantly less similar to non-hair Type I keratins. An additional 3 amino acids (adjacent proline residues) not present in the wool protein have been identified near the middle of the carboxy-terminal end of the mouse protein. MHKA-1 is the first of a series of mouse hair follicle cDNA clones to be identified and characterized that will enable us to study follicular regulatory mechanisms and the interrelationships among the proteins in the mammalian hair follicle.\r"

  ".W": "During cellular remodeling that accompanies cornification of epidermal cells, the highly phosphorylated protein, profilaggrin, is dephosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved to filaggrin, the keratin matrix protein. Using rat filaggrin phosphorylated by bovine casein kinase II (CK II) as a substrate, we have partially purified a phosphatase from rat epidermis which dephosphorylates rat profilaggrin in vitro. Anion exchange, hydroxylapatite, and gel filtration chromatography yielded a 100-fold purification of phosphatase from a low-salt extract. Further purification led to loss of activity; therefore, only the partially purified phosphatase was characterized. Two forms of the phosphatase, with molecular weights of approximately 170 and 40 kDa, were resolved during gel filtration. The 170-kDa form could be converted to the 40-kDa form in the presence of dithiothreitol. Both forms had pH optima of 6.6, and were strongly inhibited by NaCl (50% inhibition at 35-40 mM). Neither form hydrolyzed para-nitrophenylphosphate or dephosphorylated casein or the synthetic peptide arg3-glu3-thr-glu3, which were phosphorylated by casein kinase II. The two forms were similarly inhibited by known inorganic phosphatase inhibitors, with 22%-36% inhibition by 0.1 mM Na+/K+ tartrate, 55%-60% inhibition by 0.1 mM NaF, and 75% inhibition by 0.1 mM Na pyrophosphate. Para-chloromercuribenzoate also inhibited the activity, suggesting that reduced thiols may be important in catalysis. One mM calcium chloride altered the activity in a complex manner depending on the pH, suggesting a possible role for calcium in regulating enzyme activity.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate quantitatively the charge-selective permeability of the basement membrane (BM) of the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ), tracer experiments using anionic and cationic ferritins were performed on an epidermal sheet, whose lamina densa was exposed on the dermal surface; its dermis was removed with forceps after the treatment of newborn rat skin with 10 mM dithiothreitol. The lamina densa and epidermal components of the sheets were electron microscopically well preserved, and anionic sites were ultrastructurally demonstrated on both the dermal and epidermal aspects of the lamina densa in the DEJ as clusters of cationic ferritins (CF) [isoelectric point (pI) greater than 9.5] or polyethyleneimine particles, indicating that the epidermal sheets were suitable for study of permeability. In tracer experiments, a large number of CF (pI 8.0-9.4) passed the lamina densa and formed clusters on both aspects of the lamina densa and in the intercellular space. The number of native anionic ferritins (NF) (pI 4.1-4.6) passing it was apparently much smaller than that of CF. When the epidermal sheets were pre-treated with protamine sulfate to neutralize the negative charges in the tissue, the number of NF penetrating the lamina densa was significantly larger than the number of those in the untreated sheet. These results indicate that the BM of the DEJ plays a role in a charge-selective filtration, although it is not as selective a barrier as the glomerular basement membrane.\r"

The type and amount of cytokeratin content was correlated with the stage of cell differentiation in these three skin types. In all specimens studied the sebocytes. The sebaceous duct cells, and the infundibular cells contained cytokeratins, no clear differences were found between normal, seborrhoeic, and acne skin. During sebocytic maturation the amount and type of cytokeratin content changed gradually and the labeling pattern was partly different compared to the interfollicular epidermal pattern. In the sebaceous duct and the infundibulum, the labeling pattern using KL1, CK8.12, and CK8.13 was similar to that seen in interfollicular epidermis, whereas labeling with CK8.60 and PKK2 was different. These findings indicate that sebaceous duct and infundibular cells express transitional patterns of differentiation between epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes. Filaggrin was expressed only in some sebaceous duct cells and in infundibular cells. In seborrhoeic and in acne skin, however, the reactivity of antibody to filaggrin was more intense and was already observed in the lower parts of the sebaceous duct and the infundibulum. Although no filaggrin was found in the intermediate cells of the sebaceous duct and the infundibulum in normal skin, these cell types clearly contained filaggrin in seborrhoeic and acne skin.\r"

The K1 keratin gene maps to chromosome region 12q11----q13; the K10 keratin gene maps to chromosome region 17q12----q21. Each gene has been mapped relative to other genes known to be localized on chromosomes 12 and 17, respectively. In somatic cell hybrid analysis, the K1 gene segregates concordantly with the Hox-3 homeo box gene cluster at chromosome region 12p12----q13. The K10 gene localizes to a region proximal to a breakpoint at 17q21 which is involved in a t(17;21)(q21;q22) translocation associated with an acute leukemia. K10 appears to be distal (telomeric) to the gene loci for G-CSF, erb-A, and Her-2, which map to chromosome region 17q12----q21. The NGFR gene and Hox-2 homeo box locus are localized distal to the 17q21 break point and thus distal to the K10 gene. These data demonstrate that keratin genes K1 and K10, which are coexpressed in terminally differentiated epidermis, are not linked in the human genome, implying the existence of trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of expression of these genes.\r"

For this reason, it is important to compare the formation of pyrimidine dimers with the induction of ODC in human skin fibroblasts after irradiation with UVC (200-290 nm) and UVB (290-320 nm). In our studies we determined cytosine-thymine (C-T) as well as thymine-thymine dimer yields (T-T) by high-pressure liquid chromatography in cultures of neonatal normal human foreskin-derived fibroblasts after irradiation with UVC and UVB light. It was found that the yield of dimerization and the ratio of T-T/C-T decreased from the UVC to the UVB region. Time-course studies of ODC-induction in the same cells indicated that the maximal activity after UVB irradiation was retarded compared to UVC exposure. For the UV-induced ODC-levels, however, no significant difference in maximal induction could be measured after UVC and UVB irradiation at fluences where comparable yields of thymine dimerization are produced. Similar ODC-maxima were obtained with strains from children, while cells from adults showed significantly less pronounced ODC induction, indicating that ODC-response decreases with age and may therefore be used as a marker of aging.\r"

  ".W": "Hairless mice were exposed to a single erythemic (25 mJ/cm2) or suberythemic dose (12.5 mJ/cm2) of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation at 297 nm. The cell kinetic changes were observed at several times during the first 7 d after the irradiation. The mitotic count, the mitotic rate (stathmokinetic method), and the number of suprabasal and basal cells were scored in histologic sections. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured after pulse labeling, and the DNA distribution pattern was studied by flow cytometry. Initially, both UVB-doses induced a block or delay in the cell proliferation. The rate of entrance of cells into mitosis and the uptake of [3H]thymidine were reduced, and cells accumulated in the S phase of the cell cycle. Hence, during the first period after irradiation, UVB seemed to interfere with the DNA synthesis by inducing a prolonged S phase duration. The DNA synthesis rate was reduced to the same degree after both UVB-doses. From 24 h after irradiation rapid regenerative proliferation took place, most pronounced after the highest UVB-dose. Waves of proliferation seemed to arise from partially synchronized cohorts of cells proceeding through the cell cycle at a higher speed than normal. Thus, the present study indicates that UVB irradiation is comparable with the cell kinetic effects following both chemical skin carcinogens and non-carcinogenic skin irritants. UVB induces an inhibitory effect on the DNA synthesis activity, in addition to regenerative cell proliferation subsequent to cell toxicity.\r"

In this study we wished to find the earliest time at which such collagen changes were detectable and also to ascertain whether a topically applied UV-B sunscreen could prevent such changes. Groups of 10 hairless albino mice were irradiated, dorsally, with a daily dose of 62 mJcm-2 UVB for 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Three parallel groups were used. They received a) no topical treatment, b) sunscreen vehicle alone, and c) sunscreen (containing 2-ethylhexyl 4'-methoxy-cinnamate) applied dorsally at 2 microliter cm-2. Dorsal and ventral (non-irradiated) skin samples were taken and the types I and III collagen quantified densitometrically after cyanogen bromide digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ratio of dorsal/ventral type III collagen (D/V III) was determined for each mouse. The topical treatments caused no change in D/V III in the non-irradiated animals. In the non-topically treated group the irradiated animals showed a considerable increase in D/V III, compared with controls, at 12 weeks (P less than 0.001). The group treated with sunscreen vehicle alone also showed a significant increase in D/V III at week 12 (P less than 0.01). Both these groups showed a slight elevation in D/V III at week 6. The group treated with sunscreen showed no significant difference in D/V III between irradiated and control animals at any time.\r"

The chemotactic response of psoriatic fibroblasts from involved skin (p less than 0.05) and uninvolved skin (p less than 0.005) is significantly enhanced compared to normal fibroblasts. Similarly, PDGF in the presence of platelet poor human plasma is a more potent mitogenic agent in psoriatic fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts.

  ".W": "The role of liver plasma membrane (LPM) fluidity in the pathogenesis of intrahepatic cholestasis in rats was assessed by comparing the effects of ethinyl estradiol, a cholestatic agent, and spironolactone on membrane fluidity and bile flow. Spironolactone is a steroid that has some feminizing actions but that lacks the phenolic A ring necessary for estrogens to cause cholestasis. Bile flow was reduced 42% (p less than 0.01) by ethinyl estradiol and increased 22% (p less than 0.05) by spironolactone; however, both agents produced a significant reduction of membrane Na+, K+-ATPase activity (p less than 0.01) and fluidity (p less than 0.01). The decreased fluidity persisted in liposomes prepared from the total lipid extract as well as the phospholipid extract of these membranes. Both agents produced similar significant increases in the cholesterol ester content and cholesterol-to-phospholipid molar ratio of the membranes. In addition, ethinyl estradiol and spironolactone increased the membrane sphingomyelin content (15% and 11%, respectively); however, neither agent altered the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids. Because the decreased fluidity persisted in liposomes prepared from phospholipids extracted from the LPMs of treated rats, changes in membrane cholesterol are not the sole cause of the altered membrane fluidity. Rather, the increased sphingomyelin is at least partially responsible for these changes. Also, because ethinyl estradiol and spironolactone produce similar changes in LPM lipid composition and fluidity but disparate effects on bile flow, membrane fluidity as assessed by fluorescence polarization does not appear to be the rate-limiting determinant of bile flow in estrogen-induced cholestasis.\r"

Seven patients undergoing long-term dialysis were infused with carbon 14--labeled 8-adenine, and their response to dialysis against acetate was compared with their response to dialysis against bicarbonate. The following changes were observed. During dialysis against acetate, the mean dialysate uric acid--to-creatinine ratio levels were significantly higher than the mean levels observed after dialysis against bicarbonate (p less than 0.001). The mean dialysate uric acid radioactivity--to-creatinine ratio and inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine radioactivity--to-creatinine ratio levels were significantly increased during dialysis against acetate (p less than 0.001). There was no significant change in plasma venous hypoxanthine level, but during dialysis against acetate, the arterial hypoxanthine levels (3.7 +/- 1.6 mumol/L) at 60 minutes were significantly higher than the levels observed after dialysis against bicarbonate (1.4 +/- 0.5 mumol/L) (p less than 0.01). These data provide evidence that excessive ATP degradation occurs during hemodialysis against acetate but not during hemodialysis against bicarbonate dialysate.\r"

Studies included renal histology, autoradiographic quantitation of renal cell tritiated thymidine uptake, renal function and renal cortical gentamicin assay. Acute proximal tubular injury, without tubular necrosis, followed by recovery, occurred during the first month. Subsequently only mild, nonprogressive tubulointerstitial changes and a twofold increase in tubular cell turnover were observed. Inulin clearance fell more than 50% during the 6 months of treatment compared with 10% in age-matched controls. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance overestimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment and did not distinguish treated animals from controls. During the month after 6 months of gentamicin, tubular microcystic changes and active tubulointerstitial nephritis developed, with a continued fall in inulin clearance. In summary, gentamicin, in \"subtherapeutic\" doses, produces mild chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with progressive renal failure. Cessation of treatment is associated with microcystic and inflammatory changes, suggesting that the renal response to tubular injury can be dissociated from the amount of toxin in the renal cortex. Keeping serum aminoglycoside levels below accepted therapeutic range for 6 months did not preclude nephrotoxicity.\r"

In this study we examined fuel concentrations in brain and blood samples and their relationship to brain growth in term fetuses of rats fed ethanol during pregnancy. The offspring of ethanol-fed (EF) rats showed a significant decrease in body and brain weights compared with those of pair-fed (PF) control rats and control rats given free access to food (ad libitum fed) (AF). The EF and PF rats consumed nearly 20% less food than the AF rats, and both groups showed a slight but significant reduction of the maternal blood glucose level. In PF rats, beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased in maternal as well as in fetal blood and brain samples, but no adverse effect of this magnitude of maternal undernutrition was observed on fetal body or brain weights. In EF fetuses, plasma glucose and pyruvate levels were decreased and lactate levels were increased, resulting in a nearly twofold increase in the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio when compared with levels in control fetuses. The beta-hydroxybutyrate--to-acetoacetate ratio was increased because of low plasma acetoacetate concentration. In EF fetuses, brain glucose and pyruvate levels were decreased. Fetal brain weight showed a positive correlation with brain glucose concentration and a negative correlation with the brain concentrations of lactate or ketones. It is surmised that an aberrant fetal fuel mixture may play a role in the fetal growth retardation associated with maternal alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretics are known to cause magnesium depletion, and the aim of the present experiment is to establish the relationship between lymphocyte magnesium concentration and intracellular magnesium concentration during chronic diuretic therapy. Studies were conducted in male Wistar rats that were subjected to daily administration of furosemide (2 mg/kg/day IP) for 19 weeks. Clearance measurements were performed during the baseline week and subsequently during the third, seventh, eleventh, fifteenth, and nineteenth weeks in both furosemide-treated (n = 32) and control rats (n = 32). Lymphocyte magnesium concentration was also measured as a determinant of intracellular magnesium concentration. Magnesium concentrations in kidney, bone, skeletal, and heart muscle tissues were also quantitated at week 11 and at the end of the experiment. After 11 weeks of furosemide administration, furosemide-treated rats developed a lower plasma magnesium concentration (0.95 +/- 0.01 mmol/L) compared with that in the control group (0.99 +/- 0.01 mmol/L). This difference persisted from week 11 to week 19 of the experiment. Fractional excretion of magnesium was modestly elevated in the furosemide-treated group. After 7 weeks of furosemide treatment, lymphocyte magnesium concentration decreased significantly in furosemide-treated rats when compared with that in the control group (1.56 +/- 0.09 micrograms/mg protein vs 1.33 +/- 0.07 micrograms/mg protein). During week 19, the lymphocyte magnesium concentration had fallen to 0.75 +/- 0.04 micrograms/mg protein as compared with 1.45 +/- 0.08 micrograms/mg protein in the control rats. There is a significant correlation between lymphocyte magnesium concentration and plasma magnesium concentration. Our present results indicate that during long-term diuretic therapy, lymphocyte magnesium concentration mirrors the reduction in plasma magnesium concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Canine pulmonary surfactant is recognized to modulate both T and B cell response in vitro. Because both responses involve cell proliferation, it has been suggested that surfactant interferes with the proliferation of lymphocytes. We herein report studies using human surfactant collected from amniotic fluid (HAFS). HAFS inhibited the proliferative response of human lymphocytes to antigen (PPD) and to allogeneic lymphocytes. Inhibition was linear within the dose range examined. Inhibition of the response to phytohemagglutinin was only evident when suboptimal doses of phytohemagglutinin were used. The effect of HAFS on the lysis of K562 human myeloid target cells by natural killer (NK) cells was also studied. Lysis in this system does not require proliferation. HAFS inhibited NK cell-induced lysis by 70% (250 micrograms HAFS per milliliter) to 95% (500 micrograms HAFS per milliliter). Inhibition was evident whether the cells were incubated with HAFS for 4 hours or for 18 hours. The NK suppressor activity was contained in the lipid fraction of HAFS, whereas the protein fraction revealed little activity. The washout experiments demonstrated that the action of HAFS was on NK cells and not on target cells. The immunomodulatory properties of surfactant affect NK cell activity and the proliferative response. Surfactant may protect the lungs from inappropriate immune reactions. Abnormalities of the lipid fraction of surfactant should be considered in studies of the mechanism of pulmonary diseases characterized by local pulmonary immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we evaluated the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine, a possible mediator of ischemic damage, on cultured neonatal rat heart cells. The rate and duration of lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation was correlated with Ca++ uptake and cell injury. The rate of carbon 14-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation during superfusion of the cells by 10 to 100 mumol/L 14C-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine was proportional to the concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine in the perfusate. Rapid accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (0.235 nmol/mg protein per minute), which occurred during 10 minutes of exposure to 100 mumol/L lysophosphatidylcholine, resulted in Ca++ overload and cell lysis. In contrast, slow accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine by myocytes, which occurred during prolonged (1 hour) exposure to a sublethal micellar concentration (80 mumol/L) or very prolonged exposure (6 hours) to a submicellar concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine (10 mumol/L) did not result in Ca++ overload or irreversible injury despite more total lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation than during a single 10-minute exposure to 100 mumol/L lysophosphatidylcholine (p less than 0.005). Repeated brief exposures (5 minutes) to 100 mumol/L lysophosphatidylcholine separated by 20-minute recovery intervals also resulted in more lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation than during the lethal 10-minute exposure to 100 mumol/L lysophosphatidylcholine but did not result in irreversible injury. We therefore conclude that cardiac myocytes can tolerate slow accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine and that factors other than the quantity of lysophosphatidylcholine accumulating in cells are determinants of the degree of injury sustained from exposure to lysophosphatides.\r"

Nucleolar volume, surface area, volume fraction within the nucleus, surface-to-volume ratio and number of nucleolar profiles per section were measured by using morphometric methods at intervals over a 6-day period of suspension culture; the results were subjected to multivariate and univariate analyses of variance. Differences between the subject groups were statistically highly significant. Overall, the findings indicated that while nucleoli became larger, rounder, and more prominent during culture, the changes were less marked in the Hodgkin's group, where there was also a decrease in nucleolar numbers. The nucleolar changes would be consistent with the macrophage development pattern being disturbed in Hodgkin's disease and would be in keeping with the known mononuclear phagocyte dysfunction in these patients.\r"

A reactivity was observed for hemoglobin C (Hb C) that was weaker than that for Hb S but still greater than 10(3) times greater than that seen for Hb A. Application of this antibody in a dot blot assay provided for a rapid (50-minute) single-step confirmatory test for Hb S, Hb C, or both in cord blood hemolysates. The sensitivity of the test would allow for mass screening of cord blood hemolysates (40 mg total hemoglobin per milliliter) and detection of Hb S, Hb C, or both at concentrations greater than or equal to 1%.\r"

  ".U": "89055015\r", 
  ".W": "Human neutrophils, incubated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), caused a rapid and substantial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in lymphoblastoid Daudi cells without producing lysis. Catalase (which destroys hydrogen peroxide), taurine and methionine (which scavenge hypochlorous acid), and chloride omission from the medium prevented the ATP fall. An ATP depletion comparable to that induced by neutrophils was observed by replacing neutrophils with an appropriate myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- enzymatic system. Together, these data suggest that the neutrophil ATP depleting activity involves the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed transformation of H2O2 into HOCl. Moreover, the free H2O2 remaining in the neutrophil extracellular environment is ineffective. In fact, a comparable amount of enzymatically generated H2O2 did not cause Daudi cell ATP loss. A direct role for H2O2 in the neutrophil-induced Daudi cell ATP depletion was observed only under artificial conditions, that is, in the presence of the heme enzyme inhibitor azide, which prevented the HOCl production but dramatically augmented the extracellular H2O2 level. Similar levels of ATP depletion in Daudi cells were induced by amounts of reagent HOCl comparable to those generated by neutrophils. As the generated HOCl can rapidly react with a variety of neutrophil-derived nitrogenous compounds (primarily ammonia and taurine) to yield chloramines, these chlorinated oxidants might contribute to the neutrophil-mediated ATP depletion. Nevertheless, the main and well-characterized chloramines (ammonia-derived monochloramine, NH2Cl, and taurine monochloramine, TauNHCl) were devoid of ATP-depleting capacity. Thus, the results suggest that the neutrophil-induced ATP depletion in Daudi cells is HOCl-dependent, is not mediated by NH2Cl or TauNHCl, and could be promoted either by HOCl directly or by an unknown derivative oxidant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Human platelet PST exists in at least a thermolabile form (TL PST) and a thermostable form (TS PST). The mean basal level of platelet TS PST activity in samples from American blacks is significantly higher than the basal activity in samples from whites. We carried out the studies reported here to determine whether the higher basal TS PST activity in platelet homogenates from blacks was biochemically similar to the lower basal activity in samples from whites. We also characterized variations in TS PST thermal stability. Platelet TS PST activities in samples from the two groups were almost identical with respect to pH optima, Michaelis-Menten constant values for substrates, and susceptibilities to inhibition by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol and sodium chloride. Thermolabile and thermostable TS PST were present in samples from both blacks and whites. Thermal stabilities of TS PST in samples from 167 volunteers (104 blacks, 63 whites) were expressed as heated sample-to-control sample ratios. Bimodal frequency distribution histograms of the heated-to-control ratios revealed subgroups of samples with thermolabile TS PST activities from 13.5% of blacks (heated-to-control ratio less than 0.32) and 12.7% of whites (heated-to-control ratio less than 0.27). The mean heated-to-control ratio for thermostable TS PST from blacks was significantly higher than that from whites (0.52 +/- 0.01 vs 0.43 +/- 0.01, respectively, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.0001). Our studies demonstrated the similarity of biochemical properties of platelet TS PST at the extremes of basal activity. They also showed equivalent subgroups of blacks and whites with thermolabile TS PST. The results are an important initial step toward testing the hypothesis that inheritance may be one factor in the regulation of basal levels of activities and thermal stabilities of platelet TS PST from American blacks.\r"

Short-term outcome was measured by the number of days lost from work and longer term outcome was measured by disability at the six-week follow-up. Unlike other published work, this study did not find obesity or a history of previous back problems to be related to a poorer outcome from acute episodes of low back pain. Among those patients not involved in manual labor, a history of anxiety or depression was a significant predictor of both greater work loss and longer term disability. Among this same group, cigarette smoking was also found to be related to greater long-term disability from acute low back pain. Further study of this relationship is needed. The number of hours of manual labor performed daily was a strong predictor of poor outcome (both short- and long-term) of acute episodes of low back pain. Among both manual laborers and professional-technical workers, the number of days off work (at bed rest) prescribed by the physician was significantly related to greater absenteeism from work; the physician's diagnosis of an actual or possible disc problem was also related (P less than .05) to greater work loss among manual laborers. Neither of these factors, however, was related to longer term disability.\r"

This article describes four patients who abused prescription diuretics in large quantities (up to 2 g/d of furosemide) for extended periods of time. Physical examination and laboratory values provided few clues to the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Other eating-related behaviors previously linked to bulimia nervosa--including abuse of diet pills, illicit amphetamines, and laxatives, as well as withholding of insulin in one diabetic patient--were present in these cases. Usually the patients' primary physicians were not aware of these problems. Physicians should be aware that patients requesting prescription diuretics may have bulimia nervosa.\r"

  ".W": "Because there is a 35 to 50 percent incidence of false-positive prediction of fetal compromise on fetal heart-rate monitoring patterns, many unnecessary cesarean sections are performed. To reduce the number of unnecessary cesarean sections, the physician is urged to consider the following: (1) fetal heart-rate monitoring is associated with higher rates of cesarean sections than in those not monitored; (2) only high-risk patients should be monitored provided the low-risk patient is at term, with a normal-sized infant, and does not convert to a high-risk patient while in labor; (3) maintenance of variability is a better predictor of absence of acidosis than is fetal scalp pH; (4) fetal scalp stimulation by firm digital pressure or gentle nontraumatic clamping of scalp tissue or acoustic stimulation obviates the need for fetal scalp pH confirmation of acidosis in 50 percent of cases; (5) monetary considerations may unconsciously lead to increased cesarean sections, since insurance companies remunerate at a higher level for those as compared with vaginal deliveries; and (6) more patients with prior cesarean section should be given a trial of labor, since the initial reason for cesarean section often is not a recurring one and many could successfully be delivered vaginally. Ultimately there is a risk inherent in any decision regarding method of delivery. The patient must understand this risk and share in the decision-making process as a knowledgeable person, aware of the limitation of her physician.\r"

Two-dimensional inhibition takes advantage of the best features of inhibition-titration and titration-inhibition, and is shown to be more sensitive than either of them. Results obtained using all the inhibition methods on secretor saliva, semen, urine, urine stain, and perspiration stain specimens show that the new technique is especially powerful in correctly determining the ABH antigens in secretor body fluids having lower concentrations of soluble blood group antigens. A two-stage version of the two-dimensional procedure that makes it a practical casework method is described as well.\r"

Each applicator was accompanied by a control blood sample, a saliva specimen, a brief sexual and menstrual history, and method of birth control of the donor. Eight of the male sexual partners of the donors submitted blood and saliva samples. One male sexual partner submitted only a saliva sample. ABH blood group substances corresponding to the donor were recovered from 36 of the 42 applicators. The remaining 6 applicators revealed a combination of the donor's and sexual partner's ABH substances. The female's PGM type was recovered from 34 of the applicators. The remaining 8 applicators failed to show PGM activity. Of the applicators, 15 indicated evidence of prior sexual intercourse by the detection of ABH substances not consistent with the applicator donor (6 samples), high levels of acid phosphatase (11 samples), or recovery of spermatozoa (8 samples) or some combination of these. All applicator samples failed to show the presence of either P30 activity or PGM factors foreign to the female.\r"

Presumptive confirmation of heroin was based on the ability to hydrolyze the HPLC heroin fraction to morphine. Heroin was also confirmed in urine by gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopic (GC/MS) analysis of the HPLC fraction. Analysis of postmortem blood, gastric contents, urine, and injection site tissues have revealed the presence of morphine and hydromorphone, while heroin has only been identified in urine.\r"

A careful inspection of samples of narcotics found at the scenes of death, coupled with changes in the illicit drug traffic detected by local and state law enforcement agencies, revealed that the rising death rate corresponded with the distinctively increased availability of a form of heroin that is produced in Mexico, commonly termed \"black tar\" heroin. An analysis of heroin deaths, comparing characteristics of cumulative deaths in the six years before the increase with those deaths associated with the apparent epidemic, revealed several significant observations. These factors, along with the distinctive physical features of black tar heroin, suggest that the rise in the narcotic abuse death rate may be related to both unfamiliarity with this type of heroin on the part of the user and the inherent difficulty of diluting nonpowdered forms of the drug to sublethal levels.\r"

Two cases of cervical airway injury as a result of impact with the steering wheel rim are presented, including one instance of complete laryngotracheal transection. Correlation of injury with crash and postcrash sequences as well as the damaged vehicle will often provide excellent crash injury reconstruction.\r"

Unfortunately, it is exceptional for forensic anthropologists to use the standard error to calculate correctly the confidence limits for their single predicted value. We attempt to show why this may be and provide explicit guidelines for the proper construction of confidence interval in such circumstances.\r"

Corresponding lumbar vertebrae from each pair of radiographs were compared for similarities and differences in several of the criteria that have been reported as useful for individualization. These include shapes of the bodies, spinous processes, transverse processes, pedicles, and osteophytic extrusions. It is our conclusion that even though bone is a flexible tissue and changes constantly during life, aspects of the criteria chosen are quite stable and that even after two-and-a-half decades the ability to make positive identifications from postcranial axial material is not necessarily diminished.\r"

During the same year, there was a marked increase in medical examiner cases where tests were positive for cocaine or its metabolites. Review of medical examiner and toxicology records from 1980 to 1986 found 87 cocaine related deaths; 46 of these were homicides. In 1986 alone, there were 53 cocaine related deaths, all manners, and 31 cocaine related homicides. In this year, 17.3% of the homicides were positive for cocaine or metabolite. The cocaine related homicides were similar to other homicides in terms of age, race, sex, blood ethanol concentration, and cause of death being due most often to firearms. In homicide cases in which an abuse drug was detected, cocaine accounted for the entire increase in 1986. Police records indicated that cocaine directly contributed to the homicide in 39% of the cases in which the drug was found. In other cases, we speculate that cocaine altered behavior may have contributed to the victim's being murdered either during the drug \"high\" or during the posteuphoric depression or withdrawal phase.\r"

Associations between study and sample characteristics and mean ES values were explored with type of setting and methodological weaknesses such as single group design and non-random assignment achieving statistical significance. Neither intervention type, number of visits, sex, age, nor type of diabetes were significantly correlated with mean ES values.

The variable which most strongly predicted the duration of the disease was age at onset. High age at onset and a progressive course of the disease were correlated with a more unfavourable prognosis. The onset symptom, vertigo, was also correlated with a shorter life expectancy. No significant effect of sex was found.

A probability sample of 5055 community-dwelling elderly in Shanghai was surveyed, 1497 aged 55-64, 2187 aged 65-74, and 1371 aged 75 and over. In the 73.3% of the subjects who had gone to school, using the age and education adjustments suggested by Kittner et al. (1986), [Kittner et al. J Chron Dis 39: 163-170; 1986] suitable cutoff scores could readily be selected to identify the subjects who should be examined intensively for the presence of dementia. However, in the 26.7% who had not gone to school, there was a significant increase in low scores on the mental status test as well as a different error pattern, reflecting the lack of formal education. Methods for following cognitive changes in illiterate individuals need further development.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of two voluntary health agencies to provide suitable target populations for epidemiologic research was explored in a pilot study of epilepsy. The results suggest that, properly approached, voluntary agencies offer advantage for this purpose. In the first agency (Group A), subjects were recruited by mail, producing a response rate of 15%. In the second agency (Group B), subjects were recruited by telephone, producing a response rate of 87%. A structured, precoded telephone interview about personal and family history of seizure disorders was administered to both groups of subjects. Subjects in Group A gave permission to contact a higher proportion of their eligible relatives than did those in Group B (73 vs 57%). Permission was obtained more often for relatives reported to have had seizures (Group A 86%, Group B 78%) than for other relatives. 89% of relatives contacted directly agreed to be interviewed. Consent forms for medical record review were signed and returned by 95% of Group A and 77% of Group B subjects. Diagnoses of etiology and seizure type of epilepsy based on the interview data agreed with diagnosis based on the medical records in most cases. In first-degree relatives of subjects with epilepsy, reported rates of epilepsy did not appear to be seriously biased.\r"

  ".W": "Hip fractures occur late in life following a substantial reduction in skeletal mass. If risk for such fractures could be predicted early, efforts to prevent excessive bone loss would be more successful and could be directed at the individuals most likely to be affected. With this objective in mind, we devised an approach to estimating the lifetime risk of a proximal femur fracture based on age and on current femoral bone mineral density, using population-based data from ongoing studies of osteoporosis and fractures among Rochester, Minnesota, women. Our calculations indicate that, at any given age, the lifetime risk of a proximal femur fracture rises as current bone density diminishes. At any given level of femoral bone density, lifetime risk rises with younger age and increasing life expectancy. While these trends seem robust, estimates of risk vary substantially with the assumptions that underlie the model. Consequently, these assumptions must be validated before our findings can be applied clinically to predict risk for individual patients.\r"

Two hundred and thirty-three events were identified. Information from death certificates, physicians, and families revealed that 22% died from acute complications of diabetes and 53% from chronic complications. Blood pressure measurement and urinalysis testing had been performed in the last year for almost all of the decedents, but other preventive practices were reported less frequently. Hypertension was present in 57% and of those, was not controlled in 73%. Forty-four percent were cigarette smokers at the time of death. Agreement between physicians and families was generally higher for clinical conditions than for care practices. This surveillance system appears to yield information about the health care of persons with diabetes not readily available from other sources, although modifications may be necessary before implementation.\r"

We have studied the detection of this event by using three oxygen monitoring techniques: pulse oximetry, transcutaneous measurement of oxygen tension, and intraarterial fiberoptic measurement of oxygen tension. Four dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and monitored with these three techniques and with arterial and central venous cannulas. Endotracheal tubes were moved from the trachea into the right mainstem bronchi at several inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) values for each dog, and the responses of the oxygen monitors were recorded for 20 minutes thereafter. The pulse oximeter showed little change in oxygen saturation (SpO2) during endobronchial intubation at FIO2 values above 0.3. SpO2 decreased by an average of 1.3 +/- 2.1% at an FIO2 of 1.0 and by 4.0 +/- 4.1% at an FIO2 of 0.5. Simultaneously measured transcutaneous oxygen tensions decreased by 42 to 64% and the optode reading decreased by 64 to 79%. At lower FIO2 values, the changes in SpO2 were more significant: a decrease of 6.0 +/- 6.3% at an FIO2 of 0.3 and of 9.8 +/- 6.1% at an FIO2 of 0.2. The transcutaneous oxygen and optode readings decreased by 31 to 45% under these conditions. Endobronchial intubations at FIO2 values greater than 0.3 may not yield immediate decreases in arterial saturation and hence may go undetected by pulse oximetry. Transcutaneous oxygen tension decreases significantly with endobronchial intubation at any FIO2. The experimental, intraarterial optode consistently yielded the greatest changes with the fastest time response.\r"

During air breathing, a small drop in arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), to about 4% below preoperative values, was observed in all patients. In 10 patients, only oxygen was given before removal of the mask. There was no sudden drop in SaO2 in these patients, but by 5 minutes after discontinuation there was no difference between the two groups of patients--SaO2 was reduced 2 to 3% below preoperative values in both groups. For patients without cardiopulmonary disease, the phenomenon of \"diffusion hypoxia\" is a mild and transient event. Clinically significant hypoxemia (SaO2 less than 90%) after removal of nitrous oxide/oxygen at the completion of the anesthetic occurred in 3 patients (6%) and was associated with airway obstruction in each case.\r"

  ".W": "Facial and hand muscles are used frequently for monitoring neuromuscular blockade. Therefore, we compared changes in electrically evoked muscle potential magnitude in upper facial and hypothenar muscles after fixed doses of neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine, 750 micrograms/kg; pancuronium, 70 micrograms/kg; vecuronium, 50 micrograms/kg; and atracurium, 300 micrograms/kg). Face-hand comparisons were made in both anesthetized (nitrous oxide/narcotic, n = 51) and comatose (closed-head injuries, n = 5) patients. In 24 anesthetized patients, complete blockade of the hypothenar muscles prevented quantitative comparison. In the remaining 27 patients, the relaxant effect (as determined by the percentage change from prerelaxant baseline muscle potentials) was significantly smaller (P less than 0.0001) in the upper facial muscles (65 +/- 24% versus 92 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD). All four evoked muscle responses to train-of-four stimulation were detectable in upper facial muscles of the 19 patients receiving non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs; this pattern was seen in hand muscles of only 7 patients (P less than 0.001). The neuromuscular blockade in both the hand (49 +/- 54%) and the upper facial area (68 +/- 28%, P greater than 0.05) of comatose patients was smaller and more variable than that seen during anesthesia. These results illustrate the value of quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular function, especially during highly variable and unpredictable drug-induced blockade in the comatose state. We conclude that during narcotic-based anesthesia the upper facial and hand muscles are differentially sensitive to commonly used neuromuscular blockers.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of medical mass spectrometers in intensive care units can be limited by too frequent obstruction of the tubing that transports gases from the patients to the analyzing unit. To overcome this problem, we developed an automated system consisting of an infrared light sensor and a three-way valve. One port of the three-way valve connects to 2.4-m disposable tubing that collects gases from the patient's airway. The second port is connected to a mass spectrometer analyzing unit through 30-m permanently installed tubing. The third port is connected to a pressurized oxygen source. An infrared light sensor is placed on the shorter tubing, between the patient and the three-way valve. When increased optical density is detected, due to entrainment of respiratory secretions, the three-way valve is activated. Gas flow is closed between the patient and the mass spectrometer and opened between the pressurized oxygen source and patient tubing to flush its contents. During the six years that the protection system has been in use, the frequency with which the disposable gas collection tubing is changed has been halved. Furthermore, periodic tests of delay and response times, performed at each bedside station, indicate that permanent connection tubing only needed cleaning at 2- to 3-year intervals. The system has decreased the cost of operating our mass spectrometers while also reducing periods of unavailability due to equipment failure.\r"

In 29 patients (60%), the tumors had BUdR LI's of less than 1%, indicating a slow growth rate; only three (10%) of these patients died of recurrent tumor during a follow-up period of up to 3 1/2 years. In contrast, of the 18 patients (40%) whose tumors had BUdR LI's of 1% or more, 12 (67%) had a recurrence and nine died during the same follow-up period. These results show that the proliferative potential, as reflected by the BUdR LI, is an important prognostic factor that separates low-grade astrocytomas into two groups and provides a more scientific rationale for selecting treatment for individual patients.\r"

Of the 12 patients who underwent subtotal removal of their tumor, two died in the perioperative period. The two patients who did not have radiation therapy postoperatively are free of apparent disease at 6 and 8 years after their operation. Eight patients underwent radiation therapy after subtotal removal of their tumor; four of these remain alive and well, and four have died of progressive disease. The role of irradiation in the treatment of subtotally resected lesion remains controversial, but this therapy is thought to be indicated for recurrent disease after a surgical excision that is as complete as possible. Histopathologically, the presence of occasional mitotic figures, microscopic infiltration, ependymal differentiation, or mild to moderate atypia was not correlated with likelihood of complete resectability or tendency to recurrence.\r"

Ninety percent of the operations were to insert the child's first shunt. The site of insertion, cause of hydrocephalus, patient's age, surgeon, duration of function (time from insertion to malfunction or to latest follow-up evaluation), presence of infection, catheter location within the ventricle, and duration of function of the subsequent shunt were recorded. Data were analyzed by the chi-square, logistic regression, and life-table methods. Shunts had been inserted via the frontal route in 62 children and via the parietal route in 52. The children's ages, causes of hydrocephalus, and infection rates were similar in both groups. Duration of shunt function was predicted by the site of shunt insertion and the catheter position within the ventricles: shunts inserted via the frontal region functioned significantly longer than parietally inserted shunts, both as the initial shunt (Wilcoxon, p = 0.0008) and after a malfunction, and catheters positioned within the ipsilateral frontal horn functioned significantly longer than those in other ventricular locations (Wilcoxon, p = 0.03).\r"

Fifteen patients had associated Chiari malformation with basilar invagination. Fifty-two patients required subsequent atlantoaxial or occipitocervical fusion. Neurological improvement was the rule. There were two deaths within 30 days of surgery: one from myocardial infarction 4 weeks after surgery and one from Gram-negative septicemia of urinary tract origin.

  ".W": "Fetal cortex from 16- and 17-day-old embryonic rats was transplanted into the parietal cortex of 12 adult rats rendered ischemic by temporary intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Ischemic injury in the host cortex adjacent to all nine surviving transplants was demonstrated with hematoxylin and eosin and cresyl violet strains. Nicotidamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical studies revealed a normal number of NADPH-d-positive neurons, whereas acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining revealed many more AChE-positive neurons in the transplants compared to the host parietal cortex. This could be due to: 1) selective survival of AChE neurons in the transplants compared to the host cortex; 2) increased expression of AChE in transplanted neurons; 3) induction of AChE in normally AChE-negative neurons; or 4) decreased transport of the AChE enzyme from the perikarya to fibers in surviving transplanted neurons. Many fibers positive for AChE and NADPH-d crossed between the host and transplant, although fiber density in the transplants was less than in normal host cortex. These results should encourage future investigation of whether similar transplants improve neurological function following experimental stroke.\r"

Local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was measured by means of a surface electrode using the hydrogen clearance technique. Systemic arterial pressure (SAP) was varied with administration of norfenefrine or by hemorrhage in order to obtain SAP/cerebral blood flow (CBF) curves under different conditions. In the control group, a typical autoregulation curve was obtained with an lCBF plateau between 70 and 120 mm Hg SAP. The nimodipine-treated animals, however, showed only a slight diminution in the slope of the curve but no real plateau, indicating impairment of CBF autoregulation. In another series, 20 anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group of 10 animals each. Intravenous Evans blue dye was used as a tracer for blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. In both groups, SAP was raised to a level of 180 mm Hg with administration of norfenefrine for 6 minutes. Extravasation of significantly more Evans blue dye was observed in the nimodipine group than in the control group, indicating impairment of the BBB. It is concluded that nimodipine may impair CBF autoregulation, allowing damage to the BBB under hypertensive conditions.\r"

  ".U": "89055330\r", 
  ".W": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) of the spine commonly cause progressive myelopathy. Occasionally, myelography reveals serpentine filling defects characteristic of a spinal AVM, but an AVM or arteriovenous (AV) fistula cannot be demonstrated arteriographically, despite selective catheterization of all vessels known to have the potential of supplying the spinal cord and spinal dura. Often, and particularly in the setting of subacute or acute deterioration, this has been attributed to spontaneous thrombosis of the veins (the Foix-Alajouanine syndrome). Three patients are reported in whom intracranial dural AV fistulas, supplied by branches of the internal and external carotid arteries, drained into spinal veins and produced myelopathy. In one patient, motor and sensory deficits were limited to the lower extremities. In all three patients, disconnection of the fistula from its spinal venous drainage permitted arrest of a rapidly progressive myelopathy and partial recovery. These findings indicate that some patients who appear to have spinal cord AVM's but exhibit negative spinal arteriography are suffering from cranial dural AV fistulas and therefore need carotid as well as spinal arteriography. The considerable distance of these fistulas from the level of neurological expression supports venous hypertension as a pathophysiological mechanism of spinal cord injury. Interruption of a cranial dural fistula draining into spinal veins permits recovery of the myelopathy.\r"

This method proved to be sensitive and specific with a true-positive result in 13 out of 14 patients with tumor and a true-negative result in five out of five patients without tumor. At any one time, 65%-80% of the whole-body radioactivity was closely associated with the cavity into which the radiolabeled antibody was administered while the radioactivity in the blood was always low, (approximately 4 X 10(-3) of administered dose/ml of blood). Concentrations of radiolabeled antibody (per gram of tumor tissue) ranged from 0.02%-0.1% of the injected dose in intracavitary tumors, but only 0.002% in a retroperitoneal metastasis. The specificity of this approach was documented in four control patients with benign ovarian cysts and in two patients who were imaged using both specific and nonspecific radiolabeled antibody. We conclude that the intracavitary administration of 131I- or 111In-labeled HMFG2 and H17E2 is a favorable route of administration and offers significant advantages over previously reported intravenous administration for the localization of breast or ovarian metastases confined to the pleural or peritoneal cavities.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was aimed to assess the usefulness of biliary agents scintigraphy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to ascertain the relationship between the uptake of these agents and the degree of HCC differentiation. Forty-four patients with this hepatic cancer were included in the study. Liver scans were performed 20 min and 3 hr after the administration of 99mTc diisopropyliminodiacetic acid (DISIDA). DISIDA scintigraphy could not be assessed in six cases. In 16 (42%) out of the remaining 38 patients, the tumor exhibited equal or greater radioactivity uptake than the surrounding liver. In six out of these 16 patients, tumor uptake was apparent in the early and delayed hepatic scans, while in the other ten subjects radioactivity uptake by the HCC could only be detected in the 3-hr delayed scans. In the remaining 22 patients, HCC appeared as a cold area. Tumor location by this technique did not differ from that observed by 99mTc-sulfur colloid scan or ultrasound. DISIDA uptake was significantly related to tumor differentiation: 70% of those well differentiated tumors exhibited DISIDA uptake, whereas it was found in only 30% of those moderately differentiated and in none of those poorly differentiated (p less than 0.05). These results show that DISIDA scintigraphy can be useful in the diagnosis of HCC. Since its sensitivity is related to the degree of tumor differentiation, it may be indicated when aspiration cytology is unable to distinguish between well differentiated HCC and reactive changes due to hepatic cirrhosis.\r"

However, past studies have described sporadic cases in which 111In leukocytes localized in tumors. Our experience using 111In leukocytes for the investigation of fever of unknown origin in cancer patients, however, indicates a relatively high incidence of 111In leukocyte localization in noninfected neoplasms. Out of the 61 patients studied for fever of unknown origin, 21 patients (34%) manifested abnormal localization of 111In leukocytes in neoplasms without clinical evidence of infection. These included patients with abnormal localization in: (a) lymph nodes, (b) soft-tissue tumors, and (c) bone neoplasms. The tumors included both primary and secondary lesions, and hematologic as well as solid tumors. The mechanism of 111In leukocyte localization in tumors is still not completely explained. Interpretations of 111In leukocyte studies in cancer patients with fever should take into consideration the possibility that localization may occur in neoplastic tissue per se and does not always indicate the presence of infection.\r"

Kinetics were assessed by analysis of 12 biopsies taken in an assay period of 90 min. Time-activity curves were fitted with a monoexponential plus constant. The halftime value of the exponential of the external curve corresponded well with the elimination rate of 131I from the myocardium: 14.6 +/- 4.5 min vs. 14.6 +/- 5.3 min. The constant was build up of three components: free 131I in cardiac tissue, the almost constant activity of the radiolabeled free fatty acid (FFA) in the myocardial lipid pool, and the radioactivity of blood and noncardiac tissues. The contribution of blood and noncardiac tissue to the constant amounted to a mean value of 77%. These findings support the analysis of externally measured time-activity curves with a monoexponential plus constant curve fit, in which background correction is not necessary. In cases where lipid storage is predominantly present, high T1/2 values, both internally and externally, were found, which were fitted with a monoexponential curve. It can be concluded that externally measured time-activity curves reflect satisfactorily the kinetics of radioiodinated heptadecanoic acid.\r"

Injection of second (anti-mouse immunoglobulin) antibodies results in slight (1.8-fold) increase of 9B9 localization ratio. Chemical modification of 9B9 aminogroups with lactose results in enhanced liver uptake and rapid blood clearance of antibody. Blood radioactivity level decreases tenfold, and as a result localization ratio increases threefold (up to 38 in 30 min). Injection of avidin following the injection of biotinylated 9B9 results in rapid clearance of blood radioactivity with increased uptake in liver and spleen. Lung uptake is not changed. Localization ratio increases fivefold over the avidin-untreated animal value. Implications of these approaches for various applications in immunoimaging are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Single-beat right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) determined using the first-pass method changes with rapid variations in the concentration of radionuclide tracer in the ventricle. Underestimation of single-beat RVEF occurs when radionuclide tracer rapidly enters the ventricle, and overestimation results when the tracer quickly flows out of the ventricle. In order to attenuate this effect, a data processing technique employing the relative \"time-volume\" curve was proposed. In the present paper, it was assumed that this time-volume curve could be approximated by dividing the original time-activity curve by a gamma variate function representing the time-concentration curve. Each single-beat ejection fraction calculated from the time-volume curve agreed well with the known phantom ejection fraction although the concentration of tracer varied rapidly. This new method was applied to several clinical cases.\r"

It has been suggested recently that the biodistribution of [99mTc]d,1-HM-PAO can be explained by its interaction with glutathione (GSH) in the tissues. We studied the interactions of the d,1 and meso isomers with GSH in vitro by measuring the partitioning of activity between ethyl acetate and aqueous GSH solutions at various concentrations. Partitioning of both isomers demonstrated a sigmoidal relationship with GSH concentration, but the d,1 isomer showed eightfold greater reactivity than the meso isomer. In a separate experiment, the d,1 isomer showed a sevenfold greater interaction rate with GSH than the meso isomer. These results suggest that the stereoisomers of [99mTC]HM-PAO show differences in their interaction rate with GSH which may explain their different retention in the brain.\r"

Finding a low cost alternative to such systems would be valuable. The authors present direct comparisons of conventional daily and acuity based nursing labor costs allocation systems. Consistent with the findings of others, they demonstrate substantial differences between these methods. There is a high correlation of nursing labor costs with the patient's ancillary costs. However, the correlation is not sufficiently strong to use as a proxy for nursing costs. Consequently, nurse executives should strive to implement nursing cost allocation systems.\r"

Animals fed the high-fat diet had higher levels of fasting plasma triglycerides and lower LPL activities in heart, renal adipose tissue and post-heparin plasma. Changes in LPL activities of skeletal muscles varied among muscles with higher values in the soleus and plantaris (32-61%) and no differences in the gastrocnemius. The lower LPL activity in renal adipose tissue was associated with lower uptake of fatty acids from 14C-CM-TG by adipose. Fatty-acid uptake from labeled TG was not associated with tissue LPL activity in other tissues. Clearance of 14C-CM-TG from plasma and the half-lives of 14C-CM-TG were similar in both dietary groups.

Ethanol increased plasma cholesterol (P less than 0.06) and triglycerides (P less than 0.0005), whereas fish oil decreased plasma cholesterol (P less than 0.005) and triglycerides (P less than 0.02). Liver cholesterol and triglycerides were increased by ethanol (P less than 0.0001) while fish oil decreased liver cholesterol (P less than 0.01) but not triglycerides. Based on Scheffe contrasts (P less than 0.05), fish oil blocked the increases in liver cholesterol and triglycerides caused by ethanol. Substitution of normal dietary fat with omega 3 fatty acid-rich fat in ethanol-fed animals lowered plasma cholesterol by 29% (P less than 0.001) and triglycerides by 30% (P less than 0.05) within 2 wk. Plasma apo A1 was increased by ethanol (P less than 0.001) and decreased by fish oil (P less than 0.002). Plasma total apo E was unaffected by either ethanol or fish oil. However, HDL apo E was decreased by ethanol (P less than 0.04) and increased by fish oil (P less than 0.02). Scheffe contrasts (P less than 0.05) also showed that plasma apo A was increased by ethanol regardless of whether the animals were consuming regular fat (1.72-fold) or fish oil fat (1.49-fold). Thus, omega 3 fatty acids can not only prevent but also reverse many of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities caused by alcohol abuse in the rat.\r"

In the first experiment, weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing 10% butter (10B), 10% corn oil (10C) or 9% butter/1% corn oil (10M) for 4 wk. Heart rate was determined in response to increasing i.v. doses of isoproterenol. The percent stimulation at the highest dose of isoproterenol (100 microM) was found to be significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the 10C-fed group than either the 10B- and 10M-fed groups. A similar study investigated the effect of propranolol inhibition of heart rate in low-fat (10C and 10B) as well as high-fat (25C) corn oil- and high-fat (25B) butter-fed animals. Heart rate was elevated with a constant i.v. infusion of isoproterenol and the inhibitory effect of propranolol was determined. The ED50 was found not to depend on the level of fat, but was found to be significantly lower in the corn oil-fed animals than in those red butter fat (P less than 0.05). Thus, animals appear to be more sensitive to these beta-adrenergic agonists/antagonists when fed a diet containing corn oil rather than butter fat as the lipid source.\r"

After 133 d of EFA deficiency, no difference was noticed in membrane phospholipid, cholesterol and protein levels, but a significant change occurred in the fatty acid composition of bilayer phospholipids. In EFA-deficient rats, linoleic (18:2(n-6] and arachidonic (20:4(n-6] acids were both severely lower while oleic (18:1(n-9], palmitoleic (16:1(n-7] and particularly 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic (20:3(n-9] acids were significantly higher than in controls. The higher level of the latter tended to compensate for the lower level of 20:4(n-6). Membrane fluidity, as estimated by the reciprocal of the order parameter S, was lower in the deficient rats than in the controls, and all the measured microsomal enzyme activities were markedly affected. NADH-Cyt b5 electron transferring system, coupled with the fatty acid desaturation system, was higher than in controls. In contrast, the cytochrome P450 complex activity was lower and some of the important liver detoxifying enzyme activities were lower due to physical-chemical changes in the microsomal membrane. Calcium uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activity were also significantly lower in EFA-deficient rats than in controls. It was concluded that fatty acid composition may be the major factor contributing to membrane fluidity and function and that EFA might play a role in regulating the intrinsic membrane protein activities.\r"

Relative synthesis rates of hepatic protein were assessed by homologous in vitro cell-free translation. RNA per liver and per g liver and incorporation of labeled leucine into protein per liver and per unit of RNA were greater for the pregnant rats than the nonpregnant rats. In conclusion, accumulation of hepatic protein during pregnancy is at least partially the result of an increase in rate of synthesis.\r"

In vivo studies of the small intestine in rats showed that the rate of disappearance of fructans was lower than that of mannose, which is known to be absorbed through passive diffusion. In addition the cariogenic effect of cereal fructans was compared to that of glucose. Acid formation from low molecular-weight fructans was found in human dental plaque in vitro. A mouth rinse with unfractionated fructans, containing some quantities of sucrose, fructose and glucose, resulted in relatively low pH values in human plaque in vivo, even if the decrease in pH was somewhat less pronounced when compared with a mouth rinse with glucose.\r"

Liver vitamin A levels decreased from 113 to 4 micrograms over a 97-d experimental period; plasma retinol concentrations did not change significantly during this time. Initially, greater than 90% of hepatic vitamin A was in the esterified form and most (93%) was localized in NPC. During vitamin A depletion, there were significant declines in retinyl ester content of both PC and NPC, but unesterified retinol levels were not significantly affected. Plasma retinol concentrations were significantly correlated with unesterified retinol mass in PC and NPC, but not with retinyl ester mass. Although 94% of the liver's negative vitamin A balance was due to changes in NPC retinyl ester levels, the fractional rate of retinyl ester loss from PC and NPC was almost identical. Since unesterified retinol levels in plasma, PC and NPC appeared to be conserved even when liver retinyl ester stores were virtually depleted, and since the retinol utilization rate was apparently not decreasing during this stage of vitamin A depletion, these data support the hypotheses that homeostatic mechanisms controlling the three pools of unesterified retinol are linked, and that vitamin A utilization rate is maintained as long as unesterified retinol levels in plasma, PC and NPC are normal.\r"

There was no major difference in the relative proportion of urinary [3H]PN-glucoside or [3H]4-PA between rats fed or injected with the radiolabeled vitamins. These results indicate that vitamin B-6 status influences the clearance of metabolites derived from PN and PN-glucoside, as well as the clearance of intact PN-glucoside. Vitamin B-6 status, however, has little or no effect on the utilization of PN-glucoside. This study also suggests that the intestine is the primary site of the limited conversion of PN-glucoside to biologically active PN in the rat.\r"

Thiamin status was evaluated in these same rats by measuring transketolase activity levels of blood before (TKA) and after (TPPE) addition of thiamin pyrophosphate to the incubation mixture of the assay procedure. Two additional experiments assessed active transport of thiamin and the effect of dietary succinylsulfathiazole (SST) on TKA and TPPE in rats with moderate FD. Intestinal absorption in general and thiamin absorption in particular and thiamin status were unaltered in rats with severe FD. Inanition associated with severe FD may impair thiamin status. Thiamin absorption by active transport was not compromised in FD, and dietary succinylsulfathiazole did not affect thiamin status.\r"

These reductions were preceded by elevations in the Zn concentrations of plasma and pancreas, and in the amylase activity of plasma and by reductions of exportable enzymes of the pancreas. Chicks fed similar levels of Zn as supplements to a non-purified diet showed no such impairments in either exocrine pancreatic function or tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations. Depression of feed intake and subsequent changes of concentrations of tissue lipid components by excess dietary Zn accounted for only a minor portion of the reduction of tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations. Tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations were moderately correlated with tissue lipid concentrations. The rate of appearance of radioactivity from an oral dose of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol-[3,4-3H]2 in plasma was reduced by 64% by addition of 500 mg Zn/kg to the purified diet for 2 wk. These results indicate that impaired enteric absorption and/or transport of vitamin E as a consequence of Zn-induced pancreatic insufficiency is a major cause of reduced tissue concentrations of alpha-tocopherol produced by excess dietary Zn.\r"

Dietary restriction increased the median lifespan from 24 to 31 mo. It delayed the rapid decrease in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from 1.5-5.0 mo in the non-restricted group to 5-13 mo in the restricted group. It also completely suppressed the marked rise in serum PTH which occurred at 22 and 28 mo in the non-restricted group. Dietary restriction had these effects even though both groups of animals consumed the same amount of Ca per gram body weight. Diet had no effect on serum Ca and P, except at 28 mo. These effects of dietary restriction on serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH may result in altered Ca metabolism in dietary restricted F344 rats.\r"

In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultured with T-cell mitogens was significantly higher in the LSO group than in the other three groups, and that in the HSO group was higher than in the MHO and SFO groups which were not different from each other. Proliferation of PBL in response to B-cell mitogens was significantly higher in the LSO group than in the SFO and MHO groups. In vitro proliferation of splenocytes (SPC) from the LSO group was higher than that from the other three groups only when SPC were cultured with T-cell mitogens. Serum antibody levels against bovine serum albumin were significantly higher in the LSO group than in the SFO group after second and third immunizations.

Female rats were fed a purified diet containing either 9 micrograms/g (low), 45 micrograms/g (adequate) or 1150 micrograms/g (high) zinc for 8 d. Hepatic metallothionein (MT) was similar in low- and adequate-zinc groups, but was 18-fold higher in the high-zinc group than in the other two groups. Liver zinc content varied in relation to dietary zinc level. Biliary excretion of all metals studied was significantly lower in the high-zinc group than in the low-zinc group. The cumulative excretion of zinc, cadmium and mercury over 2.5 h in rats fed these two diets was 6.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 33.5 +/- 7.7, 0.006 +/- 0.02 vs. 22.8 +/- 8.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.9 +/- 5.3 micrograms/kg body weight, respectively.

  ".W": "The interaction between bile salts and saponins from Gypsophylla was investigated in vitro, using changes in transmural potential difference across isolated lengths of rat jejunum as an index of the capacity of the saponin to affect the permeability of intestinal mucosal cells. The addition of saponin (ca. 5 mM) to taurocholic acid in buffered saline (pH 7.4) led to a significant increase in viscosity, indicating the formation of a polymer. The viscosity of the solution was highest at low molar ratios of bile salt to saponin (0.5-2.0). Under these conditions there was an inhibition of the permeating effect of saponins on the gut, as judged by the rate of decline in transmural PD. There was no evidence of inflammation or functional damage to the jejunal mucosa of rats fed a diet containing Gypsophylla saponin (ca. 1.5% w/w) for 7 d but changes in villus morphology were observed. There was also evidence of an increased rate of mucosal cell proliferation. Serum cholesterol levels were significantly lower in saponin-fed rats than in controls, while the cholesterol content of the cecal contents was increased. These results suggest that despite the protective effect of bile salts, Gypsophylla saponins interact with the mucosa of the proximal small intestine in vivo, but at the dietary level used in this study the mucosa was protected by an enhanced rate of cell replacement. The loss of cholesterol via exfoliated mucosal cells may contribute to the hypocholesterolemic effect of saponins in rats.\r"

The present work examined the effects of Cu given either intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) on mortality, feed intake, peritoneal fluid and hepatic accumulation of Cu and zinc (Zn) in chicks. We also studied the potential interaction of prior Zn loading on these parameters. Four-wk-old chicks were pretreated by injection (subcutaneous) with Zn acetate (5 mg Zn/kg) or sodium acetate 24 h prior to Cu treatments. Copper as Cu acetate was given either i.p. or i.v. at a dose of 1.84 mg Cu/kg. Mortality was markedly greater in those chicks given Cu i.p. compared to those given Cu i.v. (46.1% vs. 3.9%). Zinc pretreatment had no effect on any of the parameters associated with copper treatments. The accumulation (24 h) of copper in either total hepatic tissue or cytosol was comparable for both routes of injection. However, marked differences in Cu-induced hepatic Zn accumulation were observed. Massive peritoneal fluid (41% of total plasma volume) was observed 1 to 3 h following the administration of Cu i.p. None was observed in those given Cu i.v. Thus, this effect was associated with the route-dependent mortality observed in the present study. We suggest that our data highlight the gratuitous effects of reactive agents given intraperitoneally.\r"

The abnormality was identifiable with both imaging methods. For benign cystic lesions of either the maxilla or mandible (50%), MRI was overall equal to or better than CT. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior to CT in the evaluation of lesion margins and soft tissue extent of disease, whereas it was equal or slightly inferior to CT in lesion detection and in the evaluation of bone involvement. In the imaging of malignant neoplasms (50%), MRI was overall superior to CT in all four categories reviewed.

Mandibular advancement of 6.5 mm was performed on 12 adult rhesus monkeys. Six underwent maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) using the dentition, six underwent MMF using the dentition plus skeletal suspension wires. Mandibular position and changes in the length of the various anatomic regions of the suprahyoid complex were evaluated cephalometrically with the aid of radiopaque bone, muscle, and tendon markers implanted preoperatively. Relapse of the mandible in the dental MMF animals was 27% of the advancement, whereas there was none in the dental plus skeletal MMF group. Results of adaptations within the suprahyoid complex showed that 1) the suprahyoid complex was elongated slightly less than the mandible, and 2) the major adaptations (lengthening) occurred at the muscle-bone interface, the muscle-tendon interface, and within the belly of the anterior digastric muscle. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that adaptations within the suprahyoid complex to mandibular lengthening occur first at the connective tissue attachments of the muscle, and then within the muscle belly itself. The methods of dealing with the potentially distracting forces from the stretch within the suprahyoid complex are discussed.\r"

The Ep level was measured by radioimmunoassay in 119 blood samples from 48 patients obtained over a period of up to 5 years. Hematocrit values correlated significantly with the GFR, but serum Ep levels did not change with a decline in the GFR. Significant anemia was noted only when the GFR fell below 20 ml/min/1.73 m2. Episodes of spontaneous acute hypoxic stress were observed in six patients with chronic renal failure. Serum Ep levels obtained during these episodes (mean +/- SEM: 273 +/- 76 mU/ml) were tenfold higher than Ep levels during stable steady-state chronic renal failure (26 +/- 6 mU/ml), even though Ep levels were inappropriately low for the degree of anemia in the stable state. Our findings suggest that the tissue oxygenation-Ep-hematocrit feedback mechanism operates at a lower set point in patients with chronic renal failure in comparison with normal subjects.\r"

  ".U": "89055500\r", 
  ".W": "Cine magnetic resonance imaging was used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation of 91 patients with congenital heart disease. Their ages ranged from 6 weeks to 14 years. The quality of study was excellent in 81% of the cases, in which it provided complete documentation of diagnostic features; substantial diagnostic information was provided in another 14%, and the study was nondiagnostic in only 5%. This technique was most useful for evaluating areas of the right ventricle (95%), great arteries (95%), vena cava (94%), and pulmonary venous system (91%). The anatomic delineation of these areas was comparable to that obtained by cineangiography and was superior to echocardiography, especially in postoperative patients. For complex venous anomalies, magnetic resonance imaging provided better anatomic details than did angiography or echocardiography. The capability of multiplanar imaging allows complex angled views through the desired planes of the heart and great vessels. Proper sedation is essential to obtain maximum diagnostic information. Our preliminary experience suggests that this new modality provides excellent anatomic information in infants and children with congenital cardiac defects and will play an increasing role in pediatric cardiac diagnosis.\r"

Groups were matched by year of birth, race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Infants were free of major congenital anomalies and intrauterine infection. They were evaluated at term, at 20 and 40 weeks, and at 1 year corrected age. The SGA infants had a lower mean developmental quotient than the two groups of AGA infants. The SGA infants had significantly smaller body dimensions at birth, more nursery complications, and a higher incidence of major neurologic problems than their AGA-GA matches but were comparable to the AGA-BW matches. Poor growth constitutes an additional risk factor to prematurity. The results highlight the importance of comparing premature SGA infants with premature AGA infants of similar gestational age rather than similar birth weight.\r"

He made the distinction between the physician who is confronted by a patient with a problem that the physician may attempt to cure with unproved means, on one hand, and persons who mount community screening programs with unproved procedures on the other. He considers the former to be ethical and the latter unethical. Similarly, we consider the failure to avoid pitfalls--such as improper screening test administration, failure to use reliable outcome criteria, making inappropriate (although well-intentioned) predictions, and making inappropriate generalizations or drawing inappropriate conclusions--to be unethical. The pitfalls jeopardize the achievement of the desired outcome by screening programs. They also lead to inappropriate conclusions and possibly, therefore, to the use of inappropriate tests. If the scientific community does not take steps to avoid such pitfalls in developmental screening, it invites those who make health care decisions to eliminate such screening or to mandate procedures which may not be scientifically sound. Neither of these alternatives is acceptable. The only alternative, first, is to ensure that one avoids common pitfalls when screening in one's own practice and, second, to be on guard against developmental screening studies and reports that fail to avoid these errors.\r"

Eighty-three infants (68%) developed colic (mild, moderate, or severe) by 2.6 +/- 1.8 weeks of age (mean +/- SD). Zero time (baseline) breath H2 values were significantly higher in colicky compared with noncolicky infants at both 6 weeks (40.6 +/- 41.4 vs 14.8 +/- 32.9 ppm) and 3 months (27.7 +/- 38.1 vs 8.5 +/- 18.2 ppm). There were significantly more positive breath H2 tests in colicky compared with noncolicky infants at 6 weeks (78% vs 36%) and 3 months (89% vs 45%). Failure to produce H2 throughout the breath H2 test was significantly more frequent in noncolicky compared with colicky infants at 6 weeks (50% vs 18%) and 3 months (43% vs 4%). These findings remained significant even when infants with mild colic (at 6 weeks and 3 months) were included in the noncolicky group. We conclude that colicky infants produce more breath H2 in the fasting state and in response to feedings containing lactose than noncolicky infants produce. This may represent increased lactose malabsorption, differences in colonic bacterial fermentation conditions, or differences in the handling of colonic gas produced.\r"

  ".U": "89055530\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the utility of steroid response in classifying childhood nephrotic syndrome, we reviewed 119 biopsies in 92 children aged 1 to 16 years who had been followed for a mean of 7.2 years. Steroid responses were classified as steroid resistant, steroid dependent, and frequent relapser as defined by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children. Biopsy specimens were classified as showing focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 39 children, as showing lipoid nephrosis in 28, and as questionable in another 25 with either focal global sclerosis, IgM nephropathy, or mesangial prominence and tubular changes. A strong agreement (p less than 0.01) was found between children whose FSGS was steroid resistant and children whose lipoid nephrosis resulted in frequent relapses. The length of the remission after therapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide was determined in 84 children. A significantly shorter length of remission after cytotoxic drug therapy (p less than 0.05) was identified for patients with FSGS versus those with lipoid nephrosis; this difference became more significant for steroid-resistant patients in comparison with those who were steroid dependent or were frequent relapsers (p less than 0.005). Among all steroid-resistant patients, those with FSGS had shorter remissions than patients with other histologic changes (p less than 0.001). The data suggest that patterns of response to corticosteroid therapy correlate with the histologic abnormality. Thus steroid-sensitive patients need not undergo renal biopsy before receiving cytotoxic drugs. Steroid-resistant patients would benefit from a biopsy, because the findings tend to predict the outcome.\r"

A review of 139 colposcopies performed for atypical cytology revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in 25%. Of the CIN found, 85% was CIN I and 15%, II. No case of more advanced disease was found. The type and severity of the cytologic atypia correlated with the presence of CIN. However, all degrees of atypia were found to have a significant association with CIN, and the degree of cytologic atypia therefore cannot be used to exclude colposcopy in any women with atypical smears. This study suggested that cytologic atypia is an expression of early CIN, and the results support our endorsement of routine colposcopy in the evaluation of women with persistent atypia.\r"

We reviewed data on live-born, singleton infants born at our university medical center between 1935 and 1985. Our review of 42,185 such pregnancies revealed that the mean birth weight (3,279 g) of a term infant has not changed significantly during the past 50 years. The frequency of term infants' weighing less than 2,500 g has not changed, but there has been a significant increase in the percentage of macrosomic infants (greater than 4,000 g), from 3 to 14, in the last 15 years. White infants have been consistently heavier than black infants, by an average of 179 g (6.3 oz). Differences in mean birth weights have been consistently greater for male than female infants (123 g, 4.6 oz) and for multiparous than primiparous deliveries (79 g, 2.8 oz), regardless of race. Impressions from these data, spanning three generations, should be helpful for prenatal counseling.\r"

We analyzed the abortions at 14-24 menstrual weeks' gestation performed at Women's Hospital, Los Angeles, in 1985 and 1986. The abortion rate at 24 hours was 90.4%, with a mean induction-to-abortion time of 13.8 hours. Although gastrointestinal side effects were frequent, hemorrhage, infection and live births were infrequent. Prostaglandin E2 suppositories are a simple, effective and safe means of effecting second-trimester abortion that requires little surgical skill.\r"

  ".W": "The Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) was a program of five annual screening examinations for breast cancer that was conducted at 29 centers in the United States. This report presents data on breast cancer incidence and mortality among the participants. A total of 283,222 women were enrolled. Our analysis is based on 55,053 white women who were 35-74 years of age at entry and who were selected for follow-up. For the first 9 years after entry, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer was estimated as 243.6 per 10,000, which is 1.34 times the expected incidence derived by use of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. In contrast, 9-year cumulative mortality from breast cancer was only 79.6% of that expected in women with the age distribution of BCDDP participants who did not have diagnosed breast cancer at the start of observation. The ratio of observed to expected breast cancer mortality was 0.89 for women 35-49 years of age at entry, 0.76 for women 50-59 years of age at entry, and 0.74 for women 60-74 years of age at entry. Breast cancer incidence and mortality were lower for women who entered the BCDDP for routine screening than they were for women who entered for a reason such as concern about breast disease, family history of breast cancer, or a physician's recommendation. Among cases diagnosed within 5 years of entry, the 5-year case fatality attributed to breast cancer was 8.5%. Case fatality for all stages combined was greater than 50% lower for cases that were screen-detected than it was for cases that were not screen-detected. Case fatality was lower for cases diagnosed within the first 5 years of entry (which encompassed the period of screening) than it was for cases diagnosed in the sixth or seventh years.\r"

  ".W": "Dichloromethotrexate (DCMTX) has been the subject of sporadic clinical development for the last 30 years. Although DCMTX was developed in hopes of discovering a more potent antifolate, the potential pharmacologic and toxicologic advantages of the analog have become of greater interest. This phase I and pharmacokinetic trial of DCMTX given on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days was undertaken to test these potential advantages. The maximally tolerated dose on this schedule was 980 mg/m2. Hepatic toxicity was dose limiting. Malaise, myelosuppression, and mucositis were also major toxic effects. The recommended dose for subsequent phase II studies of DCMTX administered on this schedule is 785 mg/m2 with a reduction to 625 mg/m2 for patients with a poor performance status or extensive prior therapy. Plasma disappearance curves for most patients were biphasic or triphasic, although several demonstrated more complex kinetic patterns that suggested significant enterohepatic circulation. The magnitude of the area under the plasma disappearance curve was related to the severity of DCMTX-induced hepatotoxicity. The elimination kinetics were linear, with a mean plasma clearance of 294 mL/min (range, 128-715). The pharmacokinetic behavior of DCMTX does not support its use over methotrexate in regional perfusion. DCMTX's primarily nonrenal elimination suggests that it may have an advantage over methotrexate when combined with nephrotoxic drugs such as cisplatin. However, there is little reason to commit major resources to further evaluation of DCMTX unless significant advantages in antineoplastic activity are identified.\r"

RA treatment of a transformed cell line reduced the number from approximately 60 copies to an average of less than one copy per cell within 5 weeks. The composition of the RA-treated cell population was heterogeneous with respect to BPV DNA copies: 89.7% of the cells had no detectable copies, 8.6% had one copy, 1.7% had fewer than five copies, and one in 13,000 cells carried more than 10 copies. The low number of BPV DNA copies in the RA-treated cell population did not increase when the cells were subcultured before reaching confluence. RA-treated cell populations that contained less than one BPV DNA copy lost the transformed phenotype. However, a small fraction of cells (1 in 13,000) with greater than or equal to 10 BPV DNA copies retained the capacity to develop into transformed colonies. The relevance of these results to the regression of papillomavirus, DNA-carrying human lesions after exposure to retinoids and the redevelopment of these lesions after withdrawal of retinoids is discussed.\r"

The results indicate that for all three sensitizers the effects of photodynamic therapy leading to rapid necrosis of tumor tissue are not the result of direct tumor cell kill but are secondary to destruction of the tumor microvasculature. The first observable signs of destruction occur in the subendothelial zone of the tumor capillary wall. This zone, composed of dense collagen fibers and other connective tissue elements, is destroyed in the first few hours after phototherapy. However, the ultrastructural changes seen in this zone are different for the hematoporphyrin derivative, compared with chlorin and phthalocyanine. Binding of photosensitizers to the elements in this zone as well as altered permeability and transport through the endothelial cell layer because of the increased intraluminal pressure may be key features of tumor destruction.\r"

  ".W": "Iodine-125-labeled monoclonal antibody 108.4 (108.4 mAb), raised against the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, was shown to visualize sc xenografts of human oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells in nude mice. In vitro, although EGF caused an increase in the number of KB cell colonies (150% at a concentration of 160 mM), the anti-EGF receptor antibodies reduced clone formation. At a concentration at which EGF caused a 50% increase in colony number, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of 108.4 mAb resulted in a decrease in the number of cell colonies to 20% of the original value. Therefore, the effect of antibody on the KB tumor was studied in vivo in three different modes of tumor transplantation. Antitumor activity was demonstrated first by retardation (versus controls) of the growth of tumor cells as sc xenografts (P greater than .017), then by prolongation of the life span of animals with the ip form of the tumor (P less than .001), and finally on an experimental lung metastasis by a reduction in the number and size of tumors (P less than .05). When the anti-EGF receptor antibodies were added together with cisplatin, the antitumor effect was greatly enhanced, suggesting that the toxic activity of these agents is synergistic (P less than .007). The antitumor effect persisted when animals were treated with the F(ab)'2 fragment of the antibody, although it was less efficient. The Fab fragment of the antibody, whose ability to bind to the cell-associated receptor was completely conserved, did not affect the growth of the tumor. The activity manifested by the F(ab)'2 fragment of the anti-EGF receptor antibodies suggested that the antitumor effect was not due to immune mechanisms requiring the Fc portion of the antibody.\r"

  ".U": "89055824\r", 
  ".W": "To delineate the complex relationships between overall tumor oxygenation and vascular configuration, intravascular oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) saturation distributions were measured with cryospectrophotometric techniques. Four factors related to vascular morphometry and tumor growth were evaluated: a) vessel diameter, b) distance of vessel from the tumor surface, c) tumor volume, and d) vascular density. To measure intertumor heterogeneity, two murine sarcomas (RIF-1 and KHT) and two human ovarian carcinoma xenografts (OWI and MLS) were utilized. In contrast to skeletal muscle, a preponderance of very low HbO2 saturations was observed for both large and small tumors of all lines. Saturations up to about 90% were also generally present, however, even in very large tumors. Variations in vascular configuration were predominantly tumor-line dependent rather than due to inherent characteristics of the host vasculature, and widely disparate HbO2 distributions were found for alternate lines implanted in identical host mice. Although peripheral saturations remained fairly constant with tumor growth, HbO2 values were markedly lower for vessels nearer the tumor center and further decreased with increasing tumor volume. HbO2 saturations did not change substantially with increasing vascular density (except for KHT tumors), although density did decrease with increasing distance from tumor surface. Combined effects of vessel diameter, tumor volume, and vessel location on HbO2 saturations were complex and varied markedly with both tumor line and vessel class. For specific classes, HbO2 distributions correlated closely with radiobiological hypoxic fractions, i.e., for tumor lines in which hypoxic fraction increased substantially with tumor volume, corresponding HbO2 values decreased, while for lines in which hypoxic fraction remained constant, HbO2 values also were unchanged. Although these trends may also be a function of differing oxygen consumption rates between tumor lines, functional alterations in the rapidly expanding tumor vasculature undoubtedly play a primary role in explaining spatial oxygenation heterogeneities.\r"

However, enhanced N-myc RNA expression was not confined to tumors with N-myc gene amplification: all of the early (stage I and II) tumors, five stage IV-S tumors, and 12 advanced (stage III and IV) tumors had levels of N-myc RNA that were elevated up to 50-fold. While N-myc gene amplification correlated with prognosis, there was no such correlation with levels of N-myc RNA expression. The precise role of the N-myc gene in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma remains unclear.\r"

Each HO assessed only one methemoglobin concentration. Three methemoglobin blood samples were studied with 12-14%, 26-35% and 68% methemoglobin concentrations respectively. We found that the ability to detect visually an abnormal appearance of methemoglobin was significantly improved when the test sample was compared to control blood.

However, in the presence of myotoxin a very rapid decrease of antimyotoxin occurred. When antiserum injection was followed by myotoxin injection (5 min. later) the decline in antibodies was immediate and no antibodies could be detected 30 min. after the antiserum injection. When antiserum was injected either immediately or 30 min. after toxin, antibody levels declined sharply and were non-detectable 1 hr. after antiserum injection. These results have clinical significance since they indicate that antimyotoxin can still bind the toxin, even when administration of the antiserum is delayed for 30 min. after injection of the toxin. Multiple injections of antiserum may be required to maintain a neutralizing level of antiserum.\r"

After 15 minutes, the animals were given either naloxone (2 mg/kg + 3 mg/kg/h), verapamil (0.08 mg/kg + 0.08 mg/kg/h), or physiological saline. In the group given naloxone, a significant decrease in heart rate was seen. Although MAP and max dP/dT increased, there was no significant difference from controls. Naloxone did not decrease mortality. When the bolus dose of verapamil was given, a significant decrease in MAP and max dP/dT was obtained. Although the mean blood pressure was significantly higher in those animals treated with verapamil who survived 60 minutes, verapamil did not change the course of the amitriptyline poisoning. In conclusion, our findings indicate that naloxone lacks significant positive effects and that verapamil has an additional negative inotropic effect. Neither drug can be recommended for the treatment of amitriptyline poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to assess potential handling hazards from the pesticidal use of HCN-liberating \"cyanide fumigation powders\". Simulations were conducted in enclosed chambers on the release of HCN vapor from wetted powder containing 40% NaCN/60% kaolin at application rates of 1 g powder/m3 of space (usual rate) and 5 g/m3 (overuse condition). With the overuse situation, HCN vapor concentrations may be rapidly attained that produce serious or lethal toxicity; with the lower application rate minor signs and symptoms of HCN vapor exposure toxicity may develop. The acute peroral LD50 (rat and rabbit) of fumigant formulation is reduced in proportion to the kaolin content, but kaolin does not modify the inherent toxicity of NaCN. A typical cyanide hazard exists from swallowing cyanide fumigant powder formulations. Lethal systemic toxicity was produced by contamination of the eye (rabbit) with powder formulation, which also caused a rapid onset of moderately severe conjunctivitis and keratitis. Applied to dry intact skin (rabbit) neither NaCN nor its kaolin formulation produced systemic toxicity. However, on moistened intact skin lethal amounts of cyanide were absorbed; but the kaolin content reduced the hazard in comparison with NaCN-alone applied to moist skin. With abraded dry skin there was no difference in lethal toxicity between NaCN-alone and its formulation; also, the toxicity of the formulation on abraded skin was three times that on intact moist skin. These finds indicate that the use of cyanide fumigant powder formulations may be hazardous by contact of powder with moist or abraded skin, contamination of the eye, swallowing, and inhalation of evolved HCN. There is a clear need for respiratory, cutaneous, and ocular protection when handling cyanide fumigant powder formulations.\r"

Large amounts of HAS are infused to premature babies with respiratory distress syndrome, patients with plasmapheresis treatment or acute renal failure. For assessment of the risk of metal loading in patients with acute renal failure, commercially available HAS were analyzed for aluminium, nickel, chromium, manganese, cobalt, zinc, copper, cadmium, lead, and mercury. A considerable contamination of HAS was found for Al, Ni, Cr, Mn, and in part for Co. Additionally, the influence of 3 weeks of daily HAS infusion on metal blood levels was studied in 8 critically ill patients with acute renal failure, protein catabolism, ventilator therapy and hemodialysis treatment. Since most metals are primarily eliminated with the urine, these patients seemed to be at high risk for metal loading. In all patients, a considerable increase in the blood concentrations of Al, Ni, Cr, and in some patients of Mn and Co was found. In addition, the daily dose of Al, Ni, Cr, Mn, and Co by HAS was calculated for the 21st day after start of HAS infusion. In most patients, the dose of Al, Ni, and Cr considerably exceeded (up to a factor of 10) the average daily metal dose absorbed from the diet by healthy subjects. The increase in Mn and Co blood levels, despite a low dose of Mn and Co with the daily HAS infusion, was most likely caused by depletion of Mn and Co tissue stores due to the catabolic state of the patients. The contamination of HAS probably originated from the use of aluminum hydroxide and from contact of plasma with stainless steel surfaces during the Cohn fractionation process. The high extent of contamination of HAS with Al, Ni and Cr cannot be accepted since it is already technically feasible to produce HAS with metal concentrations comparable to the normal serum level range.\r"

To define more completely the variables that can be used to predict those patients with low biological potential requiring limited treatment from those needing more extensive therapy, a retrospective study of 232 patients with incidentally discovered cancer was undertaken. Progressive disease was used as an endpoint for statistical analysis with the Kaplan-Meier technique and Cox's multiple hazard regression mode. This extensive analysis of multiple parameters demonstrated a significant advantage of survival free of disease for patients presenting with tumors manifesting a lower Gleason score and volume extent. Probability tables were constructed to allow for prediction of the probability of progression for a given patient with incidentally discovered prostate cancer directly related to patient age at diagnosis, Gleason score, and initial volume extent of the tumor. With these tables a logical therapeutic approach can be derived for each patient in an attempt to maximize survival free of disease with minimal intervention.\r"

Several studies have shown that survival free of disease is increased by additional therapy but the choice of treatment remains unclear. The lack of matched controls has prevented rigid statistical analysis of the efficacy of prostatectomy and radiotherapy or expectant management in the treatment of these tumors. A prior review of 251 patients with stage A prostate cancer provided a population base from which to perform a matched pair analysis between 30 control patients receiving no additional treatment and 30 patients treated by either prostatectomy or radiotherapy. A second and unpaired analysis was performed among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (17), radiotherapy (31) and expectant management alone (33). The treated group achieved a significantly superior survival free of disease over the matched control group managed expectantly. The unpaired analysis again demonstrated the advantages of treatment over no treatment but failed to define a clear statistical difference between the 2 treated groups. Radical prostatectomy appeared to provide a recognizable advantage over radiotherapy in survival free of disease but was not statistically significant owing to the small size of the sample population.\r"

Pheochromocytomas contained significantly larger amounts of norepinephrine, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, tyrosine hydroxylase activity, metanephrine, normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid than did normal adrenal medullae. The content ratio of epinephrine/norepinephrine in normal adrenal medullae was significantly higher than that in pheochromocytomas but there were considerable individual variations in the metanephrine/normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid/3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylglycol ratios in pheochromocytomas. In normal adrenal medullae the tissue content of tyrosine hydroxylase activity correlated inversely with the tissue contents of epinephrine (r equals -0.78, p less than 0.001), norepinephrine (r equals -0.78, p less than 0.001) and total catecholamines (r equals -0.87, p less than 0.001), respectively but no significant relation was found between both parameters in pheochromocytomas. These results indicate the possible presence of a negative feedback mechanism of catecholamine via tyrosine hydroxylase in normal adrenal medullae but none in pheochromocytomas. In addition, the increased degradation catecholamine pathway in pheochromocytomas appears to be unstable compared to that in normal adrenal medullae.\r"

Endourological procedures failed in 20 other cases. Altogether, 36 patients (38 per cent) required an open operation consisting of ureteroureterostomy (9), ureterocalicostomy (7), ureteral reimplantation (6), Boari flap (5), pyeloplasty (4), ileal interposition (3), undiversion (1) and nephrectomy (1).

  ".W": "A new method for urinary diversion to the rectum was elaborated in animal experiments and currently has been used in 19 patients. Reflux of the rectal content to the colon and to the upper urinary tract is prevented by the fashioning of an intussusception valve at the rectosigmoid junction. The rectum is augmented by anastomosing an ileal patch to the anterior rectal wall. A transverse colostomy protects the construction for 6 to 8 weeks. Of the 19 patients 3 had local recurrence or metastasis within 6 months. Thus, 16 patients with a followup of 3 to 14 months are evaluable. All patients are continent during the daytime with an emptying frequency of 3 to 5 times and dry at night with a frequency of 0 to 2. In 3 patients partial sliding of the sigmoid intussusception valve occurred causing reflux of rectal contents to the sigmoid and to the right ureter in 1. Reflux to the upper urinary tract has not been revealed in any of the other patients. With 1 exception excretory urography has demonstrated either improvement or stabilization of the upper urinary tract post-operatively. The rectal capacity increased from 200 to 700 ml. after 6 months. With the reservoir full the mean basal pressure was 17 cm. water and the mean maximum pressure was 24 cm. water.\r"

With immunohistochemical techniques we assayed the bladder biopsies of 14 interstitial cystitis patients and 10 normal controls for intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein to assess indirectly the in vivo permeability of the urothelium. Eight pathological controls, including bladder biopsies from 3 patients with inflammation owing to infection or catheterization and biopsies of 5 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, also were assayed. Superficial intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein was identified in the biopsies from 10 of 14 interstitial cystitis patients (71 per cent) but only 1 of 10 controls (10 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Tamm-Horsfall protein was not identified in biopsies from the pathological controls. In 6 of 7 cases when more than 1 biopsy was available for analysis the findings were identical in each specimen. There was a direct correlation between the density of detrusor mast cells and the demonstration of intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein. Seven of the 9 evaluable interstitial cystitis patients with intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein but only 1 of 4 without intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein experienced a favorable response to intravesicle oxychlorosene sodium (p greater than 0.05). These data suggest that abnormal permeability of the urothelium is associated with and a possible cause of interstitial cystitis and that the demonstration of intraurothelial Tamm-Horsfall protein in bladder biopsy specimens may prove to be useful as a diagnostic test for interstitial cystitis.\r"

Lymph nodes were identified in the bundle of tissue left in the pelvis with the nerve-sparing radical cystectomy in 6 of the 10 dissections (60 per cent). Because these lymph nodes may represent the potential first site of metastatic disease leaving the bladder, the reader is cautioned about adopting the nerve-sparing radical cystectomy as part of the management of invasive bladder cancer until the long-term sequelae of the procedure are known.\r"

  ".W": "The male sexual partners of 156 women with human papillomavirus infection of the cervix uteri were examined. In 120 men (77 per cent) penile lesions were found on examination of the penis via a colposcope (peniscopy) the most common of which were flat acetowhite lesions (53 per cent). Predilection sites of lesions were the urethral meatus and the corona glandis (23 and 19 per cent of the lesions, respectively). Using filter in situ hybridization human papillomavirus-deoxyribonucleic acid was found in penile smears of 61 men (39 per cent). The cancer-associated viral types (human papillomavirus 16 and 18) were identified in 75 per cent of the human papillomavirus positive men. Viral types of sexual partners were identical in 87 per cent. The correlation between infections with human papillomavirus 16 and 18, and the severity of the cervical lesion was significant in corresponding sexual partners. Our results support the hypothesis that male sexual partners represent a risk factor by acting as a reservoir for genital infections with papillomaviruses. The majority of human papillomavirus infections are of subclinical character. They require sensitive diagnostic techniques, such as peniscopy and hybridization for their identification. Detection and treatment of subclinical human papillomavirus infection in men may be important for the prevention of genital cancer in women.\r"

Such injury occurred in only 1 of 66 patients (1.5 per cent) with blunt trauma versus 4 of 13 (31 per cent) with penetrating trauma. Bilateral ruptures were managed by bilateral partial orchiectomy in 2 cases, and orchiectomy with contralateral debridement and suturing in 1. Of 2 patients with unilateral rupture and contralateral contusion the contusions were treated by evacuation of the hematoma and the ruptures were managed by orchiectomy in 1 and partial orchiectomy in the other. Four patients were available for followup. One patient was hormonally anorchid but he obtained normal erections with testosterone cypionate, 1 had normal serum testosterone concentrations but borderline normal semen analysis, and 1 had reduced erections and borderline normal semen. The remaining patient had normal erections and no semen analysis was performed. The nature of the injury rather than the type of treatment appears to be the primary determinant of the outcome in these cases.\r"

  ".W": "The management of patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis and low volume retroperitoneal disease remains controversial. We analyzed the treatment modalities of 56 patients divided into 3 groups: group I--18 clinical stage I cancer patients who had pathological stage II disease after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, group II--31 patients with abdominopelvic computerized tomography abnormalities of 5 cm. or less with or without positive biological markers and group III--7 patients with persistently positive biological markers after orchiectomy with normal abdominopelvic computerized tomography scans. In group I 4 of 18 patients received chemotherapy after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Two patients met criteria for post-dissection chemotherapy, but they did not receive it and subsequently had relapse. Of the remaining 12 patients who were observed after dissection only 1 (8 per cent) had relapse. In group II 19 of 31 patients were treated with initial chemotherapy: 13 (68 per cent) achieved a complete response, while 6 required retroperitoneal lymph node dissection after chemotherapy. Of 31 patients 12 were treated with initial retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and 9 (75 per cent) received post-dissection chemotherapy. In group III 5 of 7 patients were treated with initial retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and 3 of the 5 subsequently required chemotherapy. Of the 7 patients 2 received initial chemotherapy and achieved a complete response. All 56 patients are without disease at 4+ to 106+ months (median 28 months). We conclude that patients with the characteristics of groups II and III should be managed initially with chemotherapy, with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection reserved for patients who fail to achieve a complete response. In group I retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is sufficient initial treatment if pathological evaluation of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes does not meet our criteria for post-dissection adjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

The anatomical proximity of an inguinal hernia to the enlarged prostate raises the possibility of joint, concurrent surgical treatment of both disorders. We report on the successful preperitoneal repair via a Pfannenstiel incision of 131 inguinal hernias in 97 patients who had undergone retropubic prostatectomy owing to benign enlargement of the prostate. Followup averaged 7 years and included 91 patients with 122 direct and indirect, unilateral or bilateral hernias. Summation of our results shows a low recurrence rate (4.9 per cent) and no complications in the wake of the combined operation. In our opinion prostatectomy combined concurrently with inguinal hernia repair via a preperitoneal retropubic approach should be applied routinely in urological practice.\r"

The clinic records of 4,843 patients between 40 and 79 years old seen at the Brooke Army Medical Center prostate cancer screening clinic between January 1979 and September 1985 were reviewed. Of the patients with palpable nodules 122 were found on biopsy to have adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We compared the clinical and, when possible, pathological stage of disease diagnosed at the initial clinical visit to those from patients who had prior normal digital rectal examinations at the screening clinic and who were followed at our clinic. There was a numerically striking difference in the percentage of patients in each group with clinical as well as pathological stage B cancer. Due to the small number of patients in each group these differences were not statistically significant.\r"

The majority of the patients without metastases had well or moderately well differentiated carcinoma. Of 18 patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma 17 had metastases at presentation. The patients without metastases were left untreated, while those with metastases received active antitumor treatment. Local progression and/or development of metastases during surveillance occurred in 24 patients (42 per cent) and antitumor treatment was initiated. Mean observation time in the group untreated throughout observation was 47 months. Mean interval to progression in the patients treated subsequently was 31 months. In the surveillance group no difference in mean interval to progression, frequency of local progression, development of metastases or death rate of prostatic carcinoma was found when the patients with initially well and moderately well differentiated carcinoma were compared. Therefore, in our study initial cytological grade failed to predict a difference in progression in patients with well and moderately well differentiated prostatic carcinoma. Since almost all patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma had metastases at presentation a poor differentiation seems to predict a worse prognosis compared to well and moderately well differentiated tumors.\r"

Followup was 1 to 16 years (mean 6.7 years). There was no perioperative death. The most significant complications were vesical neck contracture (17 per cent), lymphedema (10 per cent) and incontinence (10 per cent). Pathological staging revealed 8 patients with stage D1 disease. Of tumor grade, stage, adjuvant hormonal treatment and ploidy pattern only the last was associated with progression and survival. An increasing number of patients with local, albeit often symptomatic, radiation failure may present during the next years and they must be treated. Salvage prostatectomy is feasible and its associated morbidity seems to be acceptable; alternative (nonoperative) treatment modalities have proved not to be effective. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern can provide valuable prognostic information in this difficult patient population for decision-making regarding radical surgery and adjuvant hormonal treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Cyproterone acetate is a steroidal antiandrogen with weak progestational activity that results in the partial suppression of pituitary gonadotropin. We demonstrate that the associated decrease in serum testosterone is more complete and prolonged if cyproterone acetate (200 mg. daily) is combined with a low dose of diethylstilbestrol (0.1 mg. daily). The effectiveness of the combination in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma was investigated in 51 patients with stage D2 malignancy. From an initial concentration of 360 +/- 23 ng. per dl. (mean +/- standard error), serum testosterone decreased to 56 +/- 5 ng. per dl. after 1 week and reached a plateau of approximately 30 ng. per dl. after 2 months. This was accompanied by a decrease in serum prostatic acid phosphatase from a mean starting concentration of 43 +/- 11 ng. per ml. to a low of 3 +/- 1 ng. per ml. at 12 months; the proportion of normal values increased from 10 to 80 per cent. A complete response was observed in 7 patients (13 per cent), partial response in 35 (69 per cent) and stable disease in 8 (16 per cent), yielding an over-all objective response rate of 98 per cent (1980 National Prostatic Cancer Project criteria). The actuarial median time to progression was 17 months and the median survival time was 23.5 months. In 26 patients who subsequently had signs of progressive carcinoma the relapse rate in bone (85 per cent) far exceeded that in nonskeletal sites (23 per cent). The incidence of cardiovascular toxicity was 12 per cent. These results indicate that cyproterone acetate and low dose diethylstilbestrol may be co-administered to achieve a synergistic and potent androgen withdrawal effect in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma.\r"

This disease has occurred in a large number of Japanese patients and more than half of all families with this disease are only partially deficient in enzyme activities (Japanese type adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency). To clarify the reasons for the preponderance of Japanese cases we sent questionnaires to 948 Japanese urological departments. The data thus obtained indicated that 76 families had 2,8-dihydroxyadenine lithiasis and of 51 families in which adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activities were assayed 76 per cent were only partially deficient in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activities. The distribution of the 2,8-dihydroxyadenine families was roughly similar to that of the population in Japan and the rates of the Japanese type adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency families were not significantly different among the various parts of Japan. These data indicate that the wide distribution of the unique mutant gene, APRT*J, that was created many years ago in a Japanese ancestor, explains at least in part the large number of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine lithiasis and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency families among the Japanese.\r"

Patients reported a high incidence of side effects from both bowel preparations, while no adverse effects were reported from those in group 3.

Bladder capacities measured by both methods in 164 patients were correlated significantly by simple linear regression (r equals 0.75, p equals 0.0001) and they were not significantly different by paired t tests (t equals 1.20, p equals 0.23). Of the patients 110 (64 per cent) had detrusor motor instability or hyperreflexia on the multichannel cystometrogram, and simple cystometry had a sensitivity of 75 per cent, specificity of 79 per cent and positive predictive value of 85 per cent for this finding. The simple procedure was practical, well tolerated and helped to provide information for management decisions that would have been difficult to obtain from many of these geriatric patients without a formal and more complex urodynamic evaluation. When performed with other simple tests of lower urinary tract function and interpreted in conjunction with a few straightforward clinical criteria, simple cystometry can be helpful to assess bladder function among incontinent geriatric patients in settings in which formal urodynamics are either unavailable or impractical.\r"

A median of 9 hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue slides per patient were examined, each containing from 1 to 15 curettings. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the following histology: predominantly stromal hyperplasia (39 patients), predominantly glandular hyperplasia (29 patients), and equal proportions of stromal and glandular hyperplasia (mixed group, 19 patients). There was no significant difference among the groups in patient age and duration of symptoms. The weight of resected tissue was significantly lower in the stromal group (median 16 mg.), compared to the glandular group (median 20 gm.) and the mixed group (median 25 gm.). Additionally, 29 of the 81 patients had chronic inflammation characterized by multifocal infiltrates of lymphocytes. These patients had significantly larger prostates (median 25 gm.) compared to those without lymphocytic infiltration (median 15 gm.). Sixty-five patients had a 3-month followup examination. Preoperatively there was no difference among the groups in maximum flow at uroflowmetry but at 3-month followup the stromal group had a median maximum flow of 13 ml. per second compared to 16.8 ml. per second in the glandular group and 21.5 ml. per second in the mixed group. These findings document histologically what has been reported from a clinical perspective: the clinical prostatism/benign prostatic hyperplasia complex is a spectrum of histological entities, and the small prostate with predominantly stromal hyperplasia responds less favorably to transurethral resection as determined by urodynamic evaluation.\r"

Gonadotropin levels were elevated, and testosterone was low and failed to increase after stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Testosterone precursors were not elevated. Testicular histology showed absence of mature Leydig cells but relatively preserved seminiferous tubules. Family history was consistent for autosomal recessive inheritance. H-Y antigen expression measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was normal, indicating that lack of other inductive factors for Leydig cell differentiation are responsible for Leydig cell hypoplasia.\r"

Saline was perfused intracavernously in five dogs to induce erection. Regardless of the amount required for induction, a mean flow rate of 23.4 ml./min. was necessary to maintain an intracavernous pressure level of 110 cm. H2O. In seven dogs, a leak was created by intracavernous insertion of a 19-gauge needle. When erection was induced by either cavernous nerve stimulation or a combination of papaverine injection and saline perfusion, the mean flow through the needle was significantly less than when erection was induced by saline perfusion alone (1.73, 1.78, and 8.77 ml./min., respectively). Sympathetic trunk stimulation at the level of L5 could reduce the intracavernous pressure by 90% in erections induced by neural stimulation or papaverine plus perfusion but had no effect on erection induced by saline perfusion alone. Our findings show that cavernosometry after intracavernous injection of papaverine will provide more valuable information in patients in whom venogenic impotence is suspected.\r"

In all monkeys, cavernosography after induction of erection by saline perfusion showed significant drainage via the cavernous veins. However, when cavernosography was performed after neurostimulation or papaverine injection, no cavernous drainage was visualized, even when the intracavernous pressure had been significantly lowered by creation of an artificial cavernous leak. Because erection can result from saline perfusion only when the volume perfused exceeds the venous outflow capability, cavernosography during saline-induced erection will always demonstrate the entire venous system and, thus, is of no diagnostic value. Pharmacocavernosography imitates the physiologic venous occlusive mechanism and should therefore be used to identify the abnormally draining veins in venogenic erectile dysfunction.\r"

Prostatic contraction could be classified into two types from the pattern of the contracting wave. One was a prominent tonic contraction, designated as H-type contraction, observed typically after hypogastric nerve stimulation and followed always by prostatic fluid excretion. The other was a weak clonic contraction, designated as P-type contraction, occurring typically after pelvic nerve stimulation and accompanied by no fluid excretion. The periodical contraction of these two types was noticed even at rest. The H-type contraction was associated with fluid excretion with a mean rate of 0.3 ml./hr. The denervation both of the hypogastric and pelvic nerves showed no distinct influence on contraction and excretion in the resting condition. The pudendal nerve was demonstrated to have no significant effect on prostatic contraction and fluid excretion. From these results, it was considered that dynamic fluid excretion followed by prostatic contraction was regulated chiefly by sympathetic fibers from the hypogastric nerve and the physiological role of parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic nerve was something other than fluid excretion.\r"

Half maximal stimulation of tritiated thymidine incorporation into BALB/c 3T3 cells was achieved by 1.6 ng./ml. of the heparin binding material. Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) only or acidic FGF (aFGF) only demonstrated that the purified protein binds to the former and not the latter. The characteristics of this material, in effect the elution profile off heparin-Sepharose, the molecular weight, angiogenic activity and the results of western blot analysis, suggest that this growth factor is similar to the family of basic fibroblast growth factors.\r"

Relief of obstruction only in the \"destructive phase\" and not in the later \"steady-state phase\" seems to improve or prevent hydronephrotic atrophy. Since the duration of partial ureteral obstruction is often not known, we studied urinary enzymes of rat kidneys after stable partial unilateral ureteral obstruction to identify the destructive phase. We chose as an example of the tubular lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and as an example of the brush border enzyme gamma-glutamyl-transferase (Gamma-GT). NAG concentration but not so much Gamma-GT concentration was higher in the urine of the obstructed kidneys than in the urine of the contralateral control kidney, in the first two weeks after operation, and then returned to normal. These observations lead to the conclusion that the \"destructive phase\" after ureteral obstruction can be identified by the appearance of high urinary tubular lysosomal enzyme content. The clinical implication is that the timing of relief of asymptomatic stable partial ureteral obstruction of unknown duration can be based on the concentrations of urinary lysosomal enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effect of conventional surgery for varicose veins has been evaluated with a new method of air-plethysmography. The functional venous volume of the leg, venous reflux, and calf muscle pump-ejecting capacity have been measured in 42 legs with primary varicose veins. The patients were studied clinically, with Doppler ultrasound, duplex scanning, and phlebography preoperatively. Doppler ultrasound was repeated postoperatively. Air-plethysmography was performed one day before surgery and 8 to 10 days after surgery. A decrease of the functional venous volume of 16% has been observed (p less than 0.001). The abolition of venous reflux has been shown in all the patients. An improvement in the calf muscle pump-ejecting capacity has also been shown, with a 30% increase of the ejection fraction of the calf muscle pump and with a 43% decrease of the residual volume fraction after 10 tiptoe movements (p less than 0.001). The results indicate that this new method of air-plethysmography apart from its diagnostic value offers a new and unique technique for a noninvasive, objective, and quantitative evaluation of the results of established and experimental venous surgery.\r"

Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice for these lesions. Historically, proximal arterial control has been the main dilemma in the management of gluteal artery pseudoaneurysm. We found transcatheter embolization to provide optimal control and eliminate the need for preperitoneal or intraabdominal dissection. Surgical repair can then be carried out without risk of intraoperative hemorrhage.\r"

In January 1987, a $25 fine for infractions of this law went into effect. This study examined numbers of car occupants with severe and fatal injuries in crashes in North Carolina, controlling for the amount of vehicle damage as a measure of crash severity. After the law, significant decreasing trends were seen in the percentages of front-seat occupants who had severe or fatal injuries in crashes, although the involvement of alcohol in crashes was still associated with an increased risk of such injury. Projections indicate that a reduction of approximately 1100 severe or fatal injuries per year can be attributed to the seat-belt law in North Carolina. This study supports the hypothesis that the societal burden of crash-associated injury can be reduced by mandating seat-belt use.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the impact of safety belt use on the extent of injuries sustained in motor-vehicle accidents and the incurred health care costs, 1364 patients were prospectively evaluated at four Chicago-area hospitals. Of these, 791 (58%) were wearing a safety belt whereas 573 (42%) were not. The mean injury severity score for safety belt wearers was 1.8 +/- 0.07 vs 4.51 +/- 0.31 in those not wearing a safety belt. Only 6.8% of safety belt wearers required admission vs 19.2% of those not wearing a safety belt. Restrained occupants incurred mean charges of $534 +/- $67 compared with $1583 +/- $201 in unrestrained occupants. Thus, safety belt wearers had a 60.1% reduction in severity of injury, a 64.6% decrease in hospital admissions, and a 66.3% decline in hospital charges. Our findings demonstrate the significant societal burden of nonuse of safety belts in terms of morbidity and the costs of medical care.\r"

  ".W": "Motor vehicle injuries are responsible for nearly 40% of the deaths that occur among persons aged 15 through 24 years. Approximately half of these deaths involve drunk drivers. In response to the problem of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), some states raised their minimum drinking age, increased penalties for DUI, or both. Other states vigorously resisted federal pressure to increase their drinking age, and some researchers have questioned the utility of this approach. Tennessee increased penalties for DUI in 1982 and raised the drinking age to 21 years in 1984. Alcohol-related motor vehicle deaths declined by 33% among persons aged 15 through 18 years, probably because of publicity. Our results suggest that it may be particularly important to maintain continuous, high-profile anti-DUI programs within high schools. Alcohol-related motor vehicle deaths declined 38% among persons aged 19 through 20 years; this effect appears to be attributable to the increase in drinking age and to be durable despite decreased publicity.\r"

Men positive for antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a considerably higher nonresponse rate to either vaccine than expected in non-HIV-infected homosexual men. The odds ratios of nonresponse to hepatitis B virus vaccine for HIV-seropositive vs HIV-seronegative subjects were 12.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 89.3) and 13.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 148.3) for the plasma and DNA recombinant vaccines, respectively.\r"

A 52-year-old man had myelodysplastic syndrome, progressive weakness of the lower extremities, and incontinence. Neuroradiological findings were consistent with lumbar stenosis and probable disk herniation. A lung lesion was also discovered on the chest roentgenogram. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated after surgical decompression. Attempts at determining other etiologies were unsuccessful. At autopsy, disseminated zygomycosis was found affecting the lung and the vasculature of the cauda equina and lumbosacral nerve roots, with resultant focal demyelination of these structures. Ribbon-like hyphal elements were also present in the caudal roots. This opportunistic pathogen is discussed along with the diagnostic challenge presented by its unusual clinical presentation.\r"
